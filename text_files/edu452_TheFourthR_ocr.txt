New occasions teach new duties, 
Time makes ancient good uncouth; 
They must upward still and onward 
Who would keep abreast of Truth. 
Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! 
We ourselves must pilgrims be; 
Launch our Mayflower and steer boldly 
Through the desperate winter sea. 
When a deed is done for Freedom, 
Through the broad earth’s aching breast 
Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, 
Trembling on from east to west. 
For mankind is one in spirit, 
And an instinct bears along, 
Round the earth’s electric circle, 
The swift flash of Right or Wrong.

PREFACE 
N the month of May, 1920, the author attended a 
convention at Palo Alto and Stanford University 
Memorial Church, California. 
At this convention it was impressed upon all present 
that there was a great need of teaching Righteousness 
to the children in the schools. 
This teaching was called the Fourth “R” as distin- 
guished from the three “R’s” (Readin’, ’Ritin’, and 
*Rithmetic), representing intellectual culture. 
For two days business was neglected and the spirit of 
the convention grew upon the writer. He was moved by 
the great injustice to the children by the failure of the 
schools of our country to teach them the fundamentals 
of character looking to the best citizenship and the 
higher ideals of Americanism, so he began immediately 
to solve the problem. 
A resolution was drawn covering the program and was 
presented to one of our distinguished judges of the State 
Supreme Court for amendment or change. After look- 
ing over the resolution he suggested that it did not need 
any change. He then recommended that the resolution 
be sent to one of our leading statesmen for considera- 
tion. This was done. 
As a result of the correspondence begun at that time 
many letters of approval were received from leading 
educators, statesmen, professional and business men scat-

tered throughout the country, and even from South 
America and India. 
The following is the resolution first written: 
RESOLUTION 
WHEREAS, one of the outstanding lessons of the great 
war, as observed by keen visioned men and women of 
the land, is the large need of adding to the intellectual 
culture and education of our schools and colleges a moral 
and spiritual atmosphere leading to righteousness with 
proper conceptions of life, duty and obligation, so that 
the future electorate of our country may be qualified to 
perform the functions of government with wisdom and 
a larger American spirit. 
And Wuereas, there is a general desire on the part 
of educators to provide the means and common ground 
by which such education may be given, we would recom- 
mend that the government urge the insertion into our 
text-books, teachings to develop such sentiment consistent 
with the higher ideals of Americanism. 
We would also recommend that the basis of said in- 
struction be the goodness of God with the view that men 
should honour Him: and that altruism should prevail 
among men without regard to creed or sect with the pur- 
pose of establishing a permanent peace. 
Believing that there is need for a treatise on the sub- 
ject of the “Fourth ‘R’” as differentiated from the 
“Three ‘R’s’” (Readin’, ’Ritin’, and ’Rithmetic) which 
represent intellectual culture, and that the “ Fourth 
*R,’” Righteousness, or Right Relations, should find a 
place in our school system, the writer has undertaken to 
point out some of the higher ideals of life which should 
be taught without infringing upon any creed or sect. 
The ideals and lessons coming under this head are 
such as would be considered wholesome to men of all
-P-A-G-E-9
PREFACE 9 
  creeds, and, if followed, would certainly form a fiber of 
character worthy of emulation by men, women and chil- 
dren of all denominations, races and governments. 
The higher ideals of Americanism fall under the 
teachings of “ The Fourth ‘R’” and should find a place 
in the lives and character of every American citizen. 
Our country has been very neglectful in failing to 
teach our children these principles, and, as a result, many 
of the older and adult citizens have grown up without 
these higher ideals which would promise better citizen- 
ship. 
Before beginning to write this book, the great need 
of such work was pointed out by the writer to many 
leading citizens of the country—practically all conceded 
the need, and expressed a hope that something might be 
done to relieve the situation. 
Several prominent educators and authors were asked 
to write a book such as might be acceptable without in- 
fringing upon the various sects and creeds. But all ap- 
peared to be engaged in other work, with time so occu- 
pied in their several spheres of life that they could not 
be persuaded to undertake the task. 
The writer was so impressed with the great need, and 
feeling that the pupils and students of our schools were 
suffering a great wrong at the hands of their seniors, he 
was impelled to undertake the work. 
As this book is practically a pioneer in the field, it is 
hoped that other writers may see their way clear to fol- 
low with more elaborate and scientific findings along 
the lines herein indicated. 
By the advice of a leading educator this treatise is 
framed as a reading book; but so arranged in chapters 
that it may be taken up for study under the various heads 
for use as a text-book. 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
10 PREFACE 
  As a further explanation as to the meaning and scope 
of the “Fourth ‘R,’” the writer would point out its 
province and purpose in the following pages relative to 
the Declaration of Independence, and the higher ideals 
of Americanism. 
In the Declaration of Independence we have not only 
a political document—declaring the purposes of the Colo- 
nists to separate themselves from the mother country and 
to establish a new and independent government, but we 
have a Spiritual Declaration, recognizing Divine Provi- 
dence, the Altruistic Purposes of Justice, and Democracy, 
and recognition of equality of men looking to the pur- 
pose of establishing the “right to life, liberty and pur- 
suit of happiness,” pledging, as it were, each to other to 
carry out this declaration. 
We have then a spiritual law or declaration woven into 
the political purpose as a background, setting forth the 
aspirations and objects of the proposed new government. 
We have here also the nuptials of the two declarations, 
the spiritual and the political, to carry out the purposes 
of which the political constitution was framed later: and 
it appears that the constitution was framed to support 
and carry out the objects and purpose of the former. 
After the political purposes of the Declaration of In- 
dependence had been accomplished and the Colonists had 
acquired their independence, George Washington, as an 
exponent of the spiritual purposes of the Declaration de- 
clared himself as standing upon the platform of Divine 
Providence (Goodness of God), Justice, and Altruism, 
when he took the oath of office and placed his hand upon 
the Scripture passage, Micah sixth chapter, eighth verse, 
“What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, 
and to love mercy and walk humbly with thy God.”
-P-A-G-E-11
  
PREFACE at 
When Warren G. Harding took the oath of office he 
placed his hand upon the same Scripture passage. 
Abraham Lincoln in many of his notable utterances, 
in his second inaugural address and in his last public 
address, voiced the same spiritual aspirations and pur- 
poses. 
Since Divine Providence and altruistic purpose are 
recognized by the Declaration of Independence and our 
great leaders, there can be no doubt or question about 
the desirability of teaching the Goodness of God and 
altruism in all our schools. In fact it is incumbent upon 
this generation to fulfill the purpose of the founders of 
the Republic, to train the children in the aspirations set 
forth in the Declaration of Independence and the utter- 
ances of the fathers of our country. It would appear, 
therefore, that by failing to give this larger vision to the 
children in our schools, we have become remiss in our 
loyalty to the highest obligation and ideals of Ameri- 
canism. 
The following pages would point out many of the won- 
derful manifestations of the purpose, wisdom and Good- 
ness of God in the light of accepted scientific findings re- 
lating to His wonderful universe. 
When we build our (man’s) world exposition we place 
the lights and arrange their reflections so that we may 
behold the genius of man. In these pages the author en- 
deavours to lead the reader through God’s World Ex- 
position and point out the wonderful works, wisdom and 
Goodness of God as shown by His lights and their 
reflections in order that men may grasp the meaning of 
life in its harmonious relations. These would lead us to 
contemplate the higher ideals and to cultivate sympa- 
thetic relations with God and man. The laws of this  
-P-A-G-E-12
12 PREFACE 
  relation embrace the constitution of all righteousness. 
“Love the Lord, thy God,—and love thy neighbour.” 
On these hang all the laws and the prophets. We hang 
the laws on the constitution. 
The scope and purpose of this book is worked out on 
the psychology of Hawthorne’s “Great Stone Face.” 
As we behold the goodness and wisdom of the Creator 
and revere His character, we are drawn to the character 
of our admiration, and function in altruism. So here 
we find the psychology as well as the constitution of all 
right relations.

ness and wisdom of God as manifest in His 
creations, relations, adaptations and purpose, the 
outstanding in prominence is Astronomy. 
In the study of the heavenly bodies, the sun, moon, 
stars, and the functioning of these systems, even with 
the unaided eye, these marvelous creations amaze us 
beyond measure. But when we add to the eye the 
telescope, photography, spectroscope and selenium-cell 
with their wonderful magnifying power, penetrating into 
heretofore unknown areas, our admiration is quickened 
to the point of reverence and awe. 
As we view the vast fields of the heavenly bodies, their 
spheres of action, their power of radiation and the be- 
nign purpose served in their movements, we would say 
with the Hebrew writer: “The heavens declare the 
glory (goodness) of God and the firmament showeth His 
handiwork—Day unto day uttereth speech and night 
unto night showeth knowledge—There is no speech nor 
language where their voice is not heard.” 
The outstanding laws operating in the field of 
Astronomy are the laws of force known as centrifugal 
and centripetal forces, together with gravitation. These 
forces hold the earth in its orbit, the planetary systems 
in their spheres, the sun, moon and stars in elegantly 
adjusted leash performing their functions in their rela- 
17 A MONG the many sciences which show the good-
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
tions to one another. These laws, so manifest, are oper- 
ating with beautiful precision and challenge the won- 
der and admiration of mankind. By the operation of 
these laws of gravitation so finely adjusted our bodies, 
houses and barns are held in place on the earth, yet, at 
the same time, animal life is free to move and roam ac- 
cording as instinct or volition may direct. This law of 
mobility operating within the law of force appears to 
be one of the mysteries of life. 
We see here also the fine checks and balances of the 
celestial sphere operating in such perfect harmony as to 
keep the world in its revolutions, to bring the seasons in 
their times, that the copious gift of life (every day a 
new gift) might continue. 
The rising sun every day in its majesty reflects unend- 
ing beauty and delight. Our emotions are intensified as 
we watch the light throw back the robe of night, reveal- 
ing creation in a new garb, every morning exquisitely 
beautiful. 
From the fine laws of gravitation manifested through- 
out all the celestial creation, we have certain laws of 
dynamics which are applied and operating under the 
hand of man. From these laws of force come our pulley 
and lever from which we have our means of locomotion 
and transportation in the form of railroad systems, our 
locomotives, automobile and motor vehicles, our ocean- 
going vessels, our water systems of travel and our air- 
craft guided by the hand of man with its great possi- 
bilities. 
As our planet is an integral part of the solar system, 
and, according to Newton’s theory: “ Every body in the 
universe attracts and is attracted by every other body 
with a force depending upon their mass, and growing 
less in exact proportion as the square of the distance be-
-P-A-G-E-19
  ASTRONOMY 19 
tween the bodies grows greater,” we must necessarily 
come under the influence of the other celestial bodies. 
So, when we consider the wonderful laws and adjust- 
ments by which the earth is held in its orbit and made 
to revolve on its axis, and the sun held at a distance 
designed to bring about the seasons suitable for planting, 
cultivating, harvesting, and a season of rest for recupera- 
tion and distribution of crops, we marvel. We wonder 
also at the benign purpose wrought out and the provision 
thus made for man’s welfare. 
We have also the lighting effects of the sun and moon, 
giving to man the necessary glow of light adapted to his 
organs of sight, the eyes, all so finely shaded to meet the 
exigencies of man’s needs. The morning sun comes up 
gradually and kindly lights the world with a glow 
adapted to the waking eye; then, as all creation responds 
to the call of light, the glow reaches an intensity of 
brightness and is prolonged to enable man to plan, cal- 
culate, work, and enjoy the fruits of his labour, while 
the sun still shines. When man with a tired body is 
ready to lie down for recuperation, and rest seems sweet, 
the evening glow appears, and the weary body again 
rests. 
But the solar system, and particularly the sun in its 
majesty, performs another function without which man 
could not exist. With the coming glow of the morning, 
borne on the shafts of light, come the heat waves to 
minister to man’s physical needs, and with benign and 
soft penetration enter into the remotest crevice of the 
world creation. It causes vegetation to flourish, fruits 
to ripen, and stimulates man’s power of assimilation, 
propagation and endurance. By the heat thus produced 
we have not only their direct effects upon the body, but 
reflections in the great storehouse of coals, oils and heat-
-P-A-G-E-20
20 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
ing processes providing and assisting chemical action to 
produce the things necessary for man’s welfare. 
The light carried upon the wings of ether as it travels 
at the rate of approximately 186,000 miles per second, 
finds a congenial companion in ether adapted as a 
vehicle for the conveyance of this wonderful power. In 
all these relations, adaptations, assimilations, we can see 
the goodness and wisdom of God in the fine adjust- 
ments of all the solar creations to the needs and even 
anticipated requirements of man. 
We might mention innumerable disasters which would 
certainly happen in case the sun and various planets 
would fail to function for a day or even an instant. But 
suffice to say they have never failed. 
When the designers of the American flag and the poet 
verging upon inspiration desired to paint a word pic- 
ture of the flag, they reached up to the heavens for the 
beautiful emblems of light, purity and love. They 
placed the starry cluster, shining amid the broad shield 
of blue; then, taking the white girdle of the Milky Way, 
they “striped its pure celestial white with streakings of 
the morning light.” Then, as if possible to add to the 
beauty of the wonderful concept, they placed the flag in 
the talons of the king of birds which flies highest and 
nearest to the heavens, “ and gave into his mighty hands 
the symbol of our chosen land.” 
One of the practical uses made of Astronomy in the 
movements and observations of the heavenly bodies is 
that made by seamen as they steer or pilot their ships 
from port to port. By compass and nautical instruments 
these navigators are entitled to tell the time and direc- 
tion of their ships from any given port; “ without chart 
or compass,” as is commonly quoted, depicts one as 
drifting without power of observation or bearings.
-P-A-G-E-21
  ASTRONOMY 21 
As a suggestion showing the immensity of space, the 
wonderful power and wisdom of our Great Creator we 
give below one of the most recent discoveries in the 
astronomical world, as taken from the Universal Service 
report from London, August, 1922: 
“ A new star has been discovered and it has taken ten 
thousand years for the light of this star to reach the 
earth! The star is called the Plaskett for the discoverer. 
According to the best calculation it is 52,560 million mil- 
lion miles from the earth; and an aeroplane traveling at 
the rate of 200 miles per hour would take 30,000 million 
years to reach this star. 
“In its distance from the earth lies our safety, be- 
cause, being more than five times larger than any other 
known heavenly body, and 160 times larger than the sun, 
the light it emits and the heat it generates would in- 
stantly shrivel this earth into ashes if it were in the 
position occupied by Mars. 
“The Plaskett belongs to that class of stars known as 
the early type—a double star, each revolving around a 
common center of gravity.” 
But more recently astronomers revised their figures 
and dimensions of the universe when they discovered a 
new cluster of stars and suns far beyond all previous 
calculations. 
This new discovery was not made by telescope alone, 
as the clusters and systems were far beyond the reach 
of the most powerful lens. But by the aid of a nega- 
tive film and photography they revealed and extended 
the universe two quintillion miles beyond former com- 
putations. 
These distances are measured by light years or “ per- 
secs,” which means the distance which light travels in 
365 days at a rate of 186,000 miles per second. It is
-P-A-G-E-22
22 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
said that it would require 165,000 years for the light 
from these clusters to reach the earth. 
The sunlight reaches the earth in approximately eight 
miatites. 
“These facts and figures are mentioned merely to show 
the wonderful power, majesty and benign purpose of the 
Great Creator. F 
Tue Race oF THE PLANETS, Mars AND JUPITER 
-You have probably read of the great Chariot Race 
as depicted by Lew Wallace in his wonderful word pic- 
ture in “ Ben Hur,” and many other races of like charac- 
ter; but you have probably not heard of the Race of the 
Planets which the writer gathers from a description 
given by one of our noted astronomers of the wonderful 
conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in November, }921. 
He describes the historic conjunction as “ comihg off 
exactly on time, as predicted four years ago.” : 
“ At 2.37 a. mM. on November 27th I rushed into the 
dome room, threw open the door and wheeled the great. 
telescope to a point on a distant peak from which Saturn _ 
was to arise. At 3.41 I saw the edge of the ring of * 
Saturn rising amid a clump of leaves of some mountain 
shrub. Then the mighty globe arose and soon the op- “ 
posite side appeared. Saturn moved rapidly,” and we 
may say stood forth as a referee for the coming race. 
“Then the lenses were centered on a far-away peak, 
where Mars and Jupiter were to arise, and I waited two 
minutes.” 
The Race was set and ready to begin. “ Then the giant 
Jupiter came out of a stony crag at 3.06, and in a quar- 
ter of a minute Mars arose.” The race was on. Jupiter 
one quarter of a minute ahead of Mars; “ then in a jiffy 
Mars had overtaken Jupiter and passed. The conjunc-

tion of these two great planets predicted four years be- 
fore had occurred exactly on time. The conjunction and 
race had passed into history. 
. “Tn the telescope I saw giant Jupiter, its four pita; 
and Mars for the first time. Mars and Jupiter were seen 
, at once, next the thin crescent moon. Then the objec- 
tives ‘were set and centered on the rising point of 
Venus. a 
“Thus I saw Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, the Moon, Venus 
and Mercury. Then I went outside and saw the Zodi- 
acal Light; it stood as a cone of pearl. The planets 
were immersed in its lovely shimmer and sheen.” 
He called it the “ Light Supernal.” 
“Later in the day I saw nine moons, five of Saturn 
and four of Jupiter. Then the Sun put on planetary 
glories and substituted its own, for the remote peaks 
were painted in crimson and gold. The memorable con- 
‘junction and massing of planets was over and soon to 
be recorded in the rapidly expanding history of As- 
tronomy.”” 
This picture would recall the Vision of the Biblical 
cae poet as he pictures the time when the “ Morning stars 
* sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy.” 
«~~ Some astronomers maintain that, by the movements of 
the heavenly bodies, so accurate is their courses, man is 
able to predict certain atmospheric conditions upon the 
earth. Sun spots, eclipses, transit of astronomical bodies 
across the path of planet or sun, or proximity of comets 
to certain bodies, may speak of drought, rains, earth- 
quake or unusual electrical disturbances. With instru- 
ments for astronomical observations, we may calculate 
the positions of these bodies at any given time past or 
present. So helpful and important is this study that 
astronomers all over the world are scouring the heavens  
-P-A-G-E-24
24 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
nightly to observe changes, if any, in their courses, or 
positions,—if haply they may discern a new body within 
the field of the telescope. Every discovery of change is 
immediately heralded throughout the world: 
These men of science move from continent to conti- 
nent at times in anticipation of a chance to observe cer- 
tain phenomena of the heavens. By the findings of these 
toilers of the night our horizon is enlarged and the won- 
ders of God’s creation are magnified. And when we 
consider the almost incalculable distances featuring the 
movements of the heavenly bodies, their orbits, diameters 
and weights, also their celerity of motion, we must, with 
uncovered heads, say with the Psalmist: “ When I con- 
sider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon. and 
stars which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou . 
art mindful of him, and the Son of man that thou visit- 
est him?” 
When the poet Addison, rising on the wings of poetic 
vision, published the following great concept, nearly two 
hundred years ago, it aroused much interest in rie 
thoughtful and literary world, causing men to think: 
soberly, and was helpful in stirring up religious fervour.

tween 280,000,000 and 400,000,000 miles. If the center 
of this star were placed at the center of our sun, the 
surface of Antares would extend out beyond the orbit 
of Mars, our next outlying neighbour in the solar sys- 
tem. Thus the diameter of Antares is considerably 
more than 300 times the diameter of our sun; its volume 
is more than thirty million times the volume of our sun. 
Its distance from us is about 250 light years—Astro-

that the stars were hidden from man’s eye the whole his- 
tory of our race would have been different—for it was

A prominent authority, commenting upon one of the 
wonders of the universe, says: “In the constellation of 
the Bull shines fiery red the giant Aldebaran, one of the 
brightest suns in all the heavens. For nearly an hour 
and a half our little moon will completely hide the huge 
sun from sight (in eclipse) although our moon. and fifty 
thousand like it might fall unnoticed on the surface ‘of

melt before reaching the surface, like a snowflake falling

GEOLOGY 
EXT to the study of Astronomy, the science of 
Geology looms up as one of the large subjects 
to claim our consideration in showing the good- 
ness of God in creation, relations and adaptations to the 
welfare of mankind. 
“Tn the beginning God created the heavens and the 
earth.” When and how we may not answer. But “in 
the beginning God created.” With the advent of man 
upon the earth, whether through a series of evolutionary 
movements bringing him to the upright posture as we see 
him to-day, appreciative of his relation to the Creator 
and fellow-man, or by one fell stroke of mighty creative 
genius and master skill, we find him seeking to under- 
stand his relation to his Creator and to solve the mys- 
teries of life and environment. 
In the science of Geology we have the open book of 
the creation of the earth, marking the various epochs and 
long periods of time during which the earth changed on 
the outward surface from ocean to land and again from 
land to ocean. These changes are seen in the various 
,strata and formations showing fossils, shells and pre- 
- historic life from which we gather the history of crea- 
tion, estimating as best we can the various periods through 
- which these changes were wrought. 
In the carboniferous period, we have the marks of an 
age when vegetation flourished most luxuriantly. Then 
followed submergence of this by the waters and other 
28 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
GEOLOGY 29 
formations, followed by an accumulation of deposits 
with decay and pressure from which we have our coals 
and oils stored away for man’s use when he reaches the 
plane of intelligence requiring their use. Then, man’s 
need of power and comfort suggests their application to 
his welfare through the various means of industrial ac- 
tivities. Necessity becomes the mother of invention and 
inventive genius. 
After the carboniferous age and other ages marking 
the various formations. of the body of the earth, we have 
the Glacial Period and others during which the surface 
becomes the special object of moulding processes. Moun- 
tains are reared by volcanic action and cooling processes 
of the crust of the earth; valleys are carved out by the 
erosion of vast glaciers, deposits are made by the glaciers 
and rivers resulting from melting ice, and the surface is 
prepared for the habitation of man. 
It is not our purpose to discuss the many processes 
by which and through which the earth passed to reach 
its present condition. It stands approved as a fit habita- 
tion for man; but suffice to say that the Creator has 
worked out with unerring hand His purposes. He has 
produced large stretches of fertile land for cultivation 
to serve man for preservation of life. He has placed the 
waters of the world in splendid proximity to these lands 
for irrigation and supplying the needed moisture for 
cultivation. The glaciers and rivers carried down the 
sediment, and kindly deposited the alluvial soil for cul- 
tivation; and the waters and rivers continue to flow. 
Where the water does not appear on the surface it may 
lie underneath only a few feet distant to be tapped by 
spade or drill. 
What a wise provision also we see in the ‘high and .~ 
often snow-capped mountain as it stands aloft as a living
-P-A-G-E-30
30 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
witness to the wonderful creative genius of God. These 
high mountains catch the snow and mists of the higher 
altitudes, which are then clasped in the arms of a cooler 
strata and eengealed into ice for storage until the sum- 
mer hot winds come to release them for service for man. 
The melting snows and ices of the mountains continu- 
ously contribute their winter savings to the beautiful val- 
leys below as needed. It may be by direct living stream, 
or by the subterranean route, or by seepage and percolat- 
‘ing flow as the waters find their way into the valleys 
through springs and soils, providing water for wells and 
fertility to the mountainsides. The forests of the moun- 
tains also play no small part in holding back the moun- 
tain waters for summer use, as man may need them. 
The metals, coals, oils, limestone, sands and ores of 
various descriptions are stored away in the mountains 
or lie deep underneath the surface of the earth waiting 
for the coming of man’s genius to bring them forth for 
man’s use and happiness. 
The oceans and seas with their ever-heaving bosoms 
call to man with fish and food for sustenance. They are 
also the great storehouses of salt which finds its way to 
man’s table or for commercial use through the many 
processes of extraction, or through the rock salts of the 
many mines embedded under ocean or the Gulf of 
Mexico. This great provision so necessary for man’s 
preservation is so abundantly provided that none need 
perish. But without it the human family could not 
exist. 
Then when we consider the great provision for man 
in animal and vegetable life, we again marvel at the 
goodness of God. However, we shall take this up under 
another head. The Hebrew writer, exulting under the 
spell of gratitude, says: “The earth is the Lord’s and
-P-A-G-E-31
GEOLOGY ‘31 
the fullness thereof and all they that dwell therein for 
he hath founded it upon the seas and established it upon 
the floods.” ‘ 
Whether we study the earth from the standpoint of 
evolution or consider it from any other view-point, we 
can see that during the long periods of time while the 
earth was in process of preparation for man, it furnished 
life and nourishment for many forms of life, now ex- 
tinct, which have aided scientists in their calculations 
and search for knowledge. We see in the museums the 
great frame of the megalosaurus and other saurian tribes, 
and in the sand and rocks their footprints. Or it may 
be that the fossils of prehistoric vegetation and other life, 
now extinct, may open our eyes to the mind and purpose 
of the Creator in articulating things which were to things 
which are now. These marks of time spell an eternity 
beyond. 
In considering the earth in its relation to the atmos- 
phere, we must study the great purpose of the Creator 
in these relations and ferret out their benign meaning. 
As we study the functions of the atmosphere in its 
relation to the earth, we see that the air serves as a 
blanket for the preservation of life. As a covering it 
may be considered a protection from other celestial 
bodies in their movements as they may throw off their 
excrescences in form of meteors, also from the many 
comets which function in the solar system, in the power 
of the earth in its revolutions on its axis, and the density 
of the atmosphere to throw off or parry these bodies 
from their course sufficiently to avoid serious contact. 
“Tt is estimated,” says J. Arthur Thomson, “ that be- 
tween ten and one hundred million meteorites enter our 
atmosphere and are cremated every day. Most of them 
weigh only an ounce or two and are invisible. Some of
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
‘them weigh a ton or more, but even against these large 
masses the air acts as a kind of torpedo-net. It is clear 
that ‘empty space’ is, at least within our solar system, 
full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas. 
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite. 
They generally burst into fragments and fall without 
doing any damage.” 
The atmosphere has served also a purpose of funda- 
mental importance in the preparation of the earth as a 
habitation for man. It blankets the earth against in- 
tensity of radiance and heat from without and inequali- 
ties of radiance and heat from within. 
Water also as second in importance has served in 
preparation of the earth for life and man. Thompson 
says, “ Water can dissolve a larger variety of substances 
in solution in a greater concentration than any other 
liquid. It is a subtle cleaver of substances and forms 
80 per cent of living matter.” 
The earth has also mechanical, chemical and thermal 
relations to the atmosphere in that through the evapora- 
tion of water and absorption by the atmosphere, these 
chemicals are taken up in solution in the proportions 
necessary for the needs of man, and the sustaining of 
life on the earth. The salts of the seas, the carbonates 
from the land surface, the various gases and materials 
which go to make up the necessary ingredients for the 
preservation of life, both in vegetable and animal crea- 
tion, are thus furnished. These are, in turn, again pre- 
cipitated according to the requirements and needs of 
man and vegetable life. 
The winds of the atmosphere also play a beneficent 
and benign purpose in the distribution of the ever- 
changing chemical combinations to the places most need- 
ful. They clarify the atmosphere, lend aid to sultry, hot
-P-A-G-E-33
GEOLOGY 33 
climates by the cooling breezes, hold in suspension the 
dusts, and rains to fall, not suddenly as a precipitate 
blanket but in a gentle, genial manner congenial to man’s 
needs. The cold and hot strata of atmosphere, as they 
alternate upon the surface, cause the rocks to crumble, 
thus producing soil. With these changing temperatures 
and the chemical changes in the atmosphere, we see the 
rocks of the mountains crumble and finally washed down 
into the valleys to become fertile soils for cultivation. 
Even the electrical disturbances in form of lightning 
serve a benign purpose as they rend the rocks, blast as 
it were, to loosen up soils or quicken vegetation in its 
growth. 
Water, waves and currents are changed by the action 
of the atmosphere and the winds as they play upon the 
ocean and sea. 
Vegetable life is quickened and plant life distributed 
by the fertilization caused by the carrying of pollens and 
seed by the wind. 
So, in the science of Geology, the benign purpose of 
the Creator is seen and is working out the highest good 
for mankind. 
They say that God lives very high 
But if you look above the pines 
You cannot see our God; and why? 
And if you dig down in the mines, 
You never see Him in the gold, 
Though from Him all that’s glory shines. 
God is so Good, He wears a fold 
Of heaven and earth across His face, 
Like secrets kept for love untold. 
But still I, feel that His embrace 
Slides down by thrills through all things made, 
Through sight and sound of every place.

BOTANY AND AGRICULTURE 
AVING noted in the previous chapters on As- 
H tronomy and Geology the wise provision of God 
in preparing the earth for habitation of man, we 
must next consider His Providence in the plans for sus- 
taining life on the earth. 
Under the head of Botany and Agriculture we may 
discern the goodness and wisdom of God in His far- 
reaching provision as shown by the laws governing under 
these sciences. 
Under the laws of Astronomy we saw the great pro- 
vision made in establishing the sun in the solar system 
with its abounding heat and light, varying in intensity 
and glow to suit the various conditions under which 
crops may be sown, cultivated, matured and harvested, 
as well as providing a season of rest both for the earth 
to recover potential energy during the season of inac- 
tivity, and for man to properly distribute the crops, fer- 
tilize and provide for the following season of activity, 
or crop year. 
Having provided heat and the genial atmosphere with 
humidity and buoyancy for carrying the moisture in the 
form of clouds to be poured out in rains at the oppor- 
tune time, as the various seasons may demand, He, 
through His goodness and wisdom, made the seed with 
power inherent to absorb from the earth, air and water 
the necessary particles, and to appropriate them both for 
building a larger and different body, and to reproduce 
itself ad infinitum. 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
36 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
But man must have food, and food must be produced 
from the seed; and the seed must necessarily find the 
ingredients for their development with the necessary sur- 
plus for reproduction. 
So we look at the structure of the seed; we analyze 
every particle and note the wise provision in its composi- 
tion, structure and inherent qualities necessary for 
preservation and propagation. We find the germ ele- 
ment laid far down in the secluded and well protected 
parts and away from the ravages of insect and weather. 
Also with an outer crust or shell, then with an inner fiber 
or covering, as a rule of a glutinous, spongy or firmer 
substance within which the germ is embedded. Note the 
kernel of the peach, almond or acorn. 
Having noted the life germ, we see a wonderful power 
inherent, as above suggested, to assimilate from the ele- 
ments nourishment to produce a stalwart tree (for ex- 
ample) with numberless branches and fruits for many 
years, besides reproducing itself most copiously. 
As the fruit is useless without the power of assimila- 
tion and desire on the part of man or beast for the fruit, 
and with facilities of body, such as hands and feet, to 
appropriate same, so we see in man these reciprocal re- 
quirements. 
Through the tissues and structure of the body power 
is also inherent to produce another. body altogether dif- 
ferent from the one appropriated. In all these assimila- 
tions and appropriations the mind of man to a large de- 
gree is brought to function as guide and monitor, aside 
from the involuntary action of the parts involved. 
Thus we see the goodness and wisdom of God in build- 
ing up from the lower to the higher until the crowning 
glory of His creations is found in the mind and soul of
-P-A-G-E-37
BOTANY AND AGRICULTURE 37 
man with power to apprehend God and come into com- 
munion and sympathy with Him. 
The calix, corrola, stamen and pistil of the blossom 
carry with them their peculiar function to protect, propa- 
gate and stimulate. The stamen with pollen and odour 
to attract the bee lie loosely for the wind to waft the 
pollen to another blossom for purposes of fertilization. 
The calix, strong in its position, stands as a support to 
the blossom, and the corrola as an outer guard to serve 
as protection to the seed and stamen, while the pistil with 
firm stalk, as it were, holds at its base and far down 
under cover the seed, and within the seed we see the 
germ life well hidden and protected from insect and 
weather as before suggested. 
The seed of animal life is also protected and hedged 
about by divine purpose for propagation and preserva- 
tion, but it is not necessary to extend the discussion at 
this time. 
As we find in the mountains and mines limitless pro- 
vision for man, so in the forests we see a wise provision 
for lumber for all building purposes. Our houses, furni- 
ture and vessels are thus provided, and with the hand 
of man in co-operation with Divine Providence, we have 
in the trees of the forest a wonderful source of supply 
of material needful to man’s shelter, warmth and equip- 
ment for house furnishings. 
In the vegetable kingdom we see a manifestation of 
the goodness of God in the many kinds of vegetables 
good for food provided in their seasons and suited to 
serve man’s needs. The potato with its variety figures 
probably more largely than any other in its use for food 
and sustenance of man. It is easily propagated, culti- 
vated by the simplest methods and by an unskilled farmer. 
The Irish potato is probably the most generally used, and
-P-A-G-E-38
    
38 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
is a common food with ingredients such as starch and 
other chemicals necessary for sustaining life. It is said 
that in 1848-49 potatoes were the sole food of the Irish 
peasantry. The sweet potato is remembered by the writer 
as one of the choice tubers of boyhood days—when the 
sweets were put on the table the boyish eyes danced with 
glee and mouth watered at the happy anticipation of a 
dinner of saccharine flavour. 
The beet, turnip, carrot, and many other of this large 
family contribute to the welfare of man in the season 
in which they mature; also in the great appeal to man’s 
appetite as he craves the nourishing products of farm 
and garden. 
The watermelon and cantaloup are among the many 
relishes of the early and mid-summer months, when re- 
freshing juices or waters of same slake the thirst and 
satisfy the palate. Then the berries come in their season 
and mark a happy period in the life of all. And you will 
note that many of these vines have guards to prevent the 
birds and insects from molesting; yet man, with care, 
finds easy access to them. 
When the vegetables have about run their course, our 
all-wise Provider then brings on the nuts and fruits 
needed; as it were, courses to suit the appetite, in the 
season. 
The corns with strong exterior fiber, with grains lying 
close together and nestling, embedded within the strong 
cob, almost say to man: “ Here we are ready for imme- 
diate action or to wait as reserve for the winter season.” 
The life germ of the grain of corn is extremely persist- 
ent in its power of propagation. It is said that a grain 
of corn buried and hid away with the mummies in the 
time of Rameses, when placed in the soil germinated and 
produced.
-P-A-G-E-39
  BOTANY AND AGRICULTURE 39 
There is also a marked manifestation of the goodness 
of God in the wise provision of the fruits in their sea- 
sons to nourish man and beast. 
As in the case of vegetables, we see that they ripen at 
a season to suit the needs of man, and that their matur- 
ing runs concurrent with man’s desire, so we may look 
at the fruits of the garden and farm and note how the 
fruits of the various trees mature with appeal suited in 
season to man’s need and appetite. 
Among the first to claim our attention is the beauti- 
fully coloured cherry with its dark hues of red and its 
lighter shades of. yellow and orange. It ripens early, at 
a time when man needs with his diet the acid juices for 
cleansing the internal organs which the cherry appar- 
ently furnishes. Such also runs concurrent with the 
early vegetables. 
Then, in order, come the peach, apricot and early 
apples, running along in season with the early melons 
and berries. 
Then, later, come the prunes, quinces and early 
oranges, and running along with these, we find the corns, 
sweet potatoes, larger beets and sugar canes, all ripen- 
ing in the later season when man begins to think of the 
winter, for which season of rest or inaction man must 
lay by the products of nature’s bounties suitable for 
storing. 
The nuts and the more hardy fruits ripen at this sea- 
son. The leaves and fruits put on their bright and gaudy 
colours and with appeal almost audible reveal their beauty 
and call to man’s wisdom and appetite. 
The squirrel and chipmunk begin to lay up for their 
winter rations and to provide for winter’s blast and 
snow. 
The cooling winds of the autumn and the peculiar
-P-A-G-E-40
  
  40 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
beauty of the leaves, together with the shorter days, ap- 
pear to awake us to nature’s call to provide for the days 
of coming rest. These are winter’s harbingers of ap- 
proaching change. 
The wheat, corns and nuts peculiarly panoplied to 
meet the conditions of winter storing may be carried into 
barns or whisked away to parts far distant, as demand 
may appear. 
In season structure and form we see the wise provision 
thus made in nature, and the goodness of God is 
manifest. 
The lettuce and early vegetables are not constructed 
suitable for the later season and for storing away for 
winter’s use. The nuts, corn, wheats and later apples 
are not made to ripen in the spring too long before the 
season for storing. 
Thus, in the science of Botany, we see the benign pur- 
pose of our Creator providing for every need of man- 
kind. 
Light has a wonderful influence upon plant life as 
well as upon animal life. The plant sends out its shoots 
which bend toward the light. And the leaves spread out 
and twist around to catch the rays of the sun. Thomson 
says that “Light interferes with the action of gravity 
on the stem and is the primary cause of leaf movement. 
The leaf is formed wide and flat as a rule, with exposure 
of surface to the light as large as possible and in colour 
(green) and in place to absorb or drink in the carbon 
dioxide, the nourishing food of the plant, from the air.” 
Vegetable life is the great transformer and prepares the 
foods for animal life. 
The leaves, the lungs of the plant, are unable to with- 
stand the frosts of winter, but the seed containing the life 
germ is built and protected even when dried up so that
-P-A-G-E-41
BOTANY AND AGRICULTURE 41 
its vital activities are reduced to a minimum and with its 
closely protected coat can resist the coldest temperature 
of the winter. It can withstand heat also, and its life is 
preserved through decades, 
Thomson says: “One of the factors that assisted the 
Allies in overcoming the food crisis in the darkest period 
of the war was the virtue of Marquis wheat, a very pro- 
lific early ripening, hard red spring wheat with excellent 
milling and baking qualities. It has enormously in- 
creased the real wealth of the world in the last ten years. 
In 1918 upwards of 300,000,000 bushels were raised in 
North America, yet the whole originated from a single 
grain planted in an experimental plot at Ottawa by Dr. 
Charles E. Saunders in 1903.”

vision made for man in the solar system, the 
preparation of the earth for man and the many 
safeguards thrown around animal life and vegetation and 
the seed for preservation, also His wisdom and goodness 
in providing moisture in form of rains and heat from the 
sun, we must look further into the great storehouse and 
see what lies within the scope of Chemistry. 
Having provided man with soil, moisture and seed, we 
look about for means for producing food for man’s pres- 
ervation. We see that he needs a helper in the form of 
tools for cultivation, also for transportation and com- 
munication. 
In the laws of Chemistry we see the merging and com- 
bination of ingredients and material changing form and 
structure. The iron ore is changed from the rough, ap- 
parently useless piece of rock to the bright and glistening 
piece of steel. The sand is changed by a combination of 
chemicals and heat to the clear or many coloured glasses. 
From the rock charged with silver, gold and other 
precious metals by the application of the laws of Chem- 
istry, we break up the rough combination, and in place 
of the seemingly worthless piece of stone we have the 
many metals for use as our purposes may require, 
Having secured the iron and steel from the ores, we 
proceed to shape them into tools, implements and ma- H veer seen from previous chapters the wise pro-

of rolling, moulding and cutting under a high degree of 
heat, and we have our plows for turning over the soil, 
our harrows for breaking up the clods, our machinery 
for planting, cultivating and reaping the crops. 
Also from the laws of chemistry and physics, affinities, 
expansion, contraction and expulsion, we have our rail- 
roads built of steel, our locomotives and cars for trans- 
portation, our automobiles and motor vehicles for indus- 
trial, commercial and social enjoyment. 
We have our telegraph and telephone systems for com- 
munication, our great merchant vessels for transporta- 
tion over ocean and sea. 
In the moving-picture world the film bows obeisance 
to the laws of Chemistry, and we have the delights and 
educational processes growing out of this wonderful addi- 
tion to man’s life. 
The artist and the great producers of art would throw 
a halo around the brow of Chemistry, were a personifica- 
tion produced. The painter mixes paints and colours to 
produce the Madonnas. Michael Angelo, Rembrandt and 
other great artists could never have brought to life, so to 
speak, their wonderful productions without the use of 
these laws. 
The food we eat, the water we drink, the clothes we 
wear, the air we breathe, the wonderful functioning of 
the physical mind and body crowd in, around and under 
these great laws. The power of assimilation of foods, 
the preparation of same by salivas, juices, and chemical 
processes besides the strength and power of reproduction, 
all bow their homage to the king of chemstry. 
In the congealed waters or ices and the liquid air, un- 
der the laws of Chemistry, we see a transformation in 
the forms almost miraculous, although in the case
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
water to ice and ice to water the transformation is most 
common. 
But here in the use of ices we see a great contribution 
to the welfare of mankind. The sufferers from fever and 
kindred diseases amid the blazing suns of the tropics, or 
in the summer heats of other zones, pay their tribute to 
the cooling draught or application of ices, as they toss 
upon their beds appealing for relief. 
The surgeon, as he applies his scalpel to the suffering 
and broken patient, can better perform the operations 
demanded when using the processes of anesthetics to the

The preservation of foods, meats and vegetables fol- 
lows upon the application of ices and salts, as these foods 
remain long in transit or in storage. 
The many colours, pleasing to the eye, the beautiful 
harmonies in dress, house colouring effects, landscape 
scenes and spectral combinations in nature, all call for 
praises of these wonderful laws. The diamond, amethyst, 
emerald, onyx, or even the beautiful pearl, whose archi- 
tect builds twixt heavy walls in deep ocean or shallow 
waters, all with one accord speak the great Creator’s 
wonderful provision in the laws of Chemistry. 
The white marbles of Vermont, the dark slabs of Ten- 
nessee, the black coals and oils of the mines and wells, 
if they could speak, would unravel a tale of wondrous 
history, pictured amid the fires, frosts, and combination 
of chemical action, bringing them to a place fit for human- 
ity’s use. 
In the fertilization of the soils by the common com- 
binations of carbon dioxides and water, htmus and bac- 
teria, we have a contribution to the welfare of man which 
adds largely to his wealth and common comforts, making 
the earth to produce more bountifully and to blossom
-P-A-G-E-45

forth as the rose, where, formerly, only weeds might 
grow. 
The newspaper, the phonograph record, the telescope 
and microscope, the thermometer and barometer, all exult 
in their praise of Chemistry. 
So, whether in the air, ocean, earth, animal and vege- 
table life, or, as we may say, in all the elements we see 
the great Creator’s provision through the laws of Chem- 
istry for all and every need, where man may work in 
harmonious action and common accord with His evident 
purpose working out the summum bonum for mankind. 
The commerce of the world may be carried upon the 
bosom of the ocean, the whirl of wheels in factory amid 
the din and mutterings of machinery, the transportation 
of products from one end of the earth to another, the 
growing and groaning of vegetable life as it presses its 
way through the soil and grasps from earth, air and 
water, the combination of chemicals for growth, repro- 
duction and fruits; all these may cause our admiration 
and wonder, but we can never arrive at a full apprecia- 
tion of these marvelous creations and their functioning 
until we begin to study the Hand which guides and stabil- 
izes the harmonious whole. 
As one poet says: 
“Till all the world take up the strain, 
And send the echo back again, 
Consider nature’s God.” 
But aside from the general laws of Chemistry as men- 
tioned above, we must consider what may be called the 
fundamentals of creation. 
The ancients thought the earth was supported on a 
gigantic elephant, and the elephant on the back of a mon- 
strous tortoise, and as J. Arthur Thomson says in his 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
“Outline of Science,” “If every animal in nature had been 
called upon, they would have been no nearer a founda- 
tion.” They left it as a whole floating in nothing; how- 
ever, they were wiser than they knew when they left it 
floating in space. “Things do not fall down unless they 
are pulled down by that mysterious force which we call 
gravitation. The earth, it is true, is pulled down by the 
sun and would fall into it, but the earth escapes this 
fiery fate by circulation at a great speed around the sun. 
The stars pull each other but they meet this by travelling 
rapidly in gigantic orbits. Yet we do, in a new sense 
of the word, need foundations of the universe. Our 
mind craves for some explanation of the matter out of 
which the universe is made.” For this explanation we 
turn to modern Physics and Chemistry. “ These sciences 
treating energy and matter have put together a concep- 
tion of the fundamental nature of things.” 
Through the study of the electron, atom, molecule and 
the relations of matter to energy and force scientists have 
developed the telescope, spectroscope and the selenium- 
cell which gives us access through these wonderful in- 
struments to a field of research and knowledge which 
otherwise would be closed to our vision. In astronomical 
observations our power of vision and resultant findings 
have been multiplied thousands of times through the use 
of the laws of matter and chemistry. In the field of the 
microscope we are almost astounded as we behold the 
wonders of nature, their laws and movements as devel- 
oped through the science of Chemistry. 
In the fields of botany and agriculture, in the relations 
of plant life, growth, fertilization and general develop- 
ments the laws of Chemistry have multiplied our harvest, 
increased our production and enriched the flavour and 
quality of the fruits of the orchard and farm.
-P-A-G-E-47
  CHEMISTRY 47 
In medical research and healing processes these laws 
and findings are practically invaluable. 
And when we come to consideration of the “ solids,” 
though they are not solids in the stricter sense of the 
term, we find these laws operating with like precision 
and wonderful accuracy. 
By the use of the microscope and chemical appliances 
we see that the solid is not a solid in structure in the 
popular sense of the word. Thomson says, “If you put 
a piece of solid gold in a little pool of mercury the gold 
will take in the mercury between its molecules, as if it 
were porous like a sponge. The hardest solid is more 
like a lattice work than what we usually mean by solid. 
If we could see right into the heart of a bit of the hardest 
steel we would see billions of separate molecules, at some 
distance from each other, all moving rapidly to and fro. 
Under the powerful microscope with appliances, the 
world of solids is found to be the wonder world of atoms 
and molecules—of course the molecule and atom cannot 
be seen but their movements can be revealed.” 
“All articles of food and clothing and the materials 
of which our houses and buildings are constructed and 
which are needed for their decorations and repair, every 
art and every industry all depend essentially for their 
production or activity upon chemical changes as realized 
in nature or made by man to serve human purposes. The 
same is true of the production and decay of animal and 
vegetable matter, as also the process by which they are 
broken up and the resulting products made available in 
their turn as food for new life. These chemical changes 
constitute a sort of adaptation of matter to environment, 
and in a sense are acts of creation, as every such change 
produces products which, although related, are quite dis- 
tinct in character and in properties from the original “
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
substances which give rise to them when subjected to 
the required influences. Thus, in a very literal sense, all 
matter which, as will be seen in other places, appears to 
be essentially one in nature, is actuated by a spirit of life, 
being susceptible to change when the environment is 
appropriate.” —KNIGZETT. 
“The continuance of civilization, the upkeep of the 
human and animal population of the globe, and even the 
supply of oxygen to the air we breathe depend on the 
silent laboratories of the green leaves, which are able 
with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic acid, water 
and salts to build up the bread of life.” —-THomson. 
“ There are within the human body certain glands such 
as the thyroid and suprarenal which manufacture subtle 
chemicals which are distributed throughout the body by 
the blood. These chemical messengers influence in regu- 
lating the vital processes. They stimulate organs and 
tissues to greater activity and are called hormones. There 
are other chemical messengers which put on the brakes, 
so to speak. These are called chalons. And others regu- 
late growth and alter the pressure and composition of the 
blood; others call into activity parts of the body which 
have been waiting the signal.” Certain energies come into 
action in youth which have lain dormant during child- 
hood. These changes are produced through the chemical 
messengers above mentioned. 
In all these changes nothing is lost, as Thomson says, 
“Tf a bar of iron is heated it becomes longer, but it re- 
turns to its original length when cooled.” The iron re- 
mains iron from first to last, so with oxygen and hydrogen. 
H,O may be in the form of water, ice, cloud, and vapour 
as steam, and associated with many other chemicals, to 
suit mankind. And these may be separated and serve 
man in the gaseous state, hydrogen, the lightest element,
-P-A-G-E-49
CHEMISTRY 49 
lifting the Zeppelin or for heating purposes, and oxygen 
for sustaining life. 
“Apart from radium and other sensational discoveries 
of recent years the study of ordinary matter is hardly 
inferior, in interest or audacity to the work of the as- 
tronomer, 
“A single grain of indigo will color a ton of water, 
which shows that billions of molecules spread throughout 
the water. 
“A grain of musk will scent a room yet not lose one 
millionth of its mass in a year.” 
With the discovery of X-rays and radium the wonder 
of the electron and the applications of these findings have 
been immensely valued by mankind. As Thomson says, 
“With the X-ray we could photograph the skeleton of 
the living man’s body, locate a penny in the interior of 
a child or take an impression of a coin through a slab of 
stone.” The discovery of radium by Madam Curie was 
a starting point of the new development of physics and 
chemistry. Then came the discovery of the electron. 
This discovery of electrons pushed forward the science 
of chemistry into a much broader field and effected a 
revolution of ideas. It became the key to many things 
hitherto a mystery. It gave a better and larger view of 
the nature and activities of matter, and Thomson says, 
“We have now a complete proof of the independence of 
atoms and also electrons.” Sir William Bragg says, “TI 
am of the opinion that atom-energy will supply all our 
future needs.” Thomson says, “ Half a brick contains as 
much energy as a small coal field.” 
But why dwell on these wonders of nature? Our 
answer is that through the wonderful findings of man 
we approach nearer and nearer the benign purpose of 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  
50 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
the great Creator who is evidently pushing man on and 
on to the goal of an infinitely larger life. 
As another illustration of the wonderful works of 
Chemistry we would cite the products of coal. From this 
we obtain gas, tar, coke, ammonia, naphtha, creosote, an- 
thracene oil, naphthalene and solvent naphtha. When 
coal-tar was first used for making gas, the by-products 
were considered troublesome. The residue consists of 
coke and coal-tar. The story of coal-tar products is very 
wonderful, but suffice to say that it is a storehouse of 
dyes, drugs, explosives and perfumes. It is one of the 
most useful substances in all the world. 
From coal-tar come ten primary products, and these 
have yielded hundreds of intermediates, such as aniline. 
And from these thousands of dyes of all shades and hues 
have come. The story of the products of coal-tar would 
fill a large sized volume. 
The story of India-rubber or caoutchouc obtained from 
plant life is also very extraordinary. And when we con- 
sider chemical conjurings in extracting sugars from 
plants, cellulose and starch from plant life, and the im- 
portance of these ingredients in animal life, we marvel. 
Inconceivably large as are some dimensions in the 
astronomical world, it is nevertheless true that our knowl- 
edge of them and of everything else in the visible universe 
is transmitted to us wholly by light-waves arising from 
the very rapid motions of the inconceivably small par- 
ticles or electric charges, called electrons, that form essen- 
tial parts of the atoms or molecules of which all matter 
is composed, and made known through chemistry and 
photography. 
Distances expressed in hundreds and thousands of 
light-years are measured through the effects produced by 
light whose waves are so short that there are about 50,000
-P-A-G-E-51
  CHEMISTRY 51 
to the linear inch. In addition to the visible radiations, 
the atoms emit the much shorter waves corresponding to 
X-rays and also longer ones called heat waves. Electric 
waves are of similar nature, but are caused by the oscilla- 
tions of electric charges in bodies larger than atoms. All 
these waves travel with the same velocity, 186,300 miles 
per second. 
The unit employed in measuring light-waves is the 
angstrom, whose length is one ten-millionth of a milli- 
meter (0.000,000,004 inch). The instruments and methods 
are so accurate that results correct to less than a hun- 
dredth of an angstrom are obtained. 
“The hydrogen atom is probably composed of a very 
small positively charged nucleus around which an electron 
circulates at a relatively great distance. The diameter 
of this orbit, or the diameter of the atom, is less than one 
hundred-millionth of an inch—1/100,000,000 inch. The 
diameter of the nucleus is of the order of one-two-thou- 
sand-billionth of an inch—1/2.000,000,000,000 inch. The 
diameter of the electron is about one five-thousand-bil- 
lionth of an inch—1/5.000,000,000,000 inch. In a cubic 
inch of air there are about 43 billion billion molecules— 
43,000,000,000,000,000,000.”—AstTRoNOMICAL SOCIETY OF 
THE PACIFIC. 
As we change the form of substances by the applica- 
tion of the laws of chemistry and note the phenomena 
of these transformations we marvel at the wonderful 
energy manifested. We see that the substance changes 
only in form: but not a particle is destroyed. This fact 
brings to our notice the wonderful economy of nature, 
or the law of the conservation of energy. The energy 
stored up in our coal fields and oil deposits is constantly 
being transmitted into life’s activities through manufac- 
turing and industrial lines, evolving and changing mat-
-P-A-G-E-52
52 THE MATERIAL UNIVERSE 
ter without dissipation into every conceivable form in 
life’s contacts. 
When we observe the wonderful gifts showered upon 
humanity by these laws and consider the benign purpose 
back of them, we can better appreciate the spirit of the 
Psalmist when he exclaims, “Oh, that men would praise 
the Lord for his goodness and his wonderful works to 
the children of men.” 
TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. Our great Creator having prepared the earth and the seed 
with rains and heat now supplies the tools through laws of 
Chemistry. 
2. Application of Chemistry to various rocks and ores extract 
the metals needful for tools and machinery, planting, cultivation 
and harvesting. Railroads, telegraph and telephone systems, 
vehicles for commercial use.

and food products, all pay obeisance to the laws of chemistry. 
4. These laws in surgery. Preservation of foods. 
5. The marbles, coals, oils and mines and -wells, their won- 
drous history. 
6. Fertilization, adding wealth to the nations through chem- 
istry. 
7. The newspaper, phonograph record, telescope, microscope, 
and photography—The wheels of commerce. 
8. Discoveries of X-Rays, radium, movements of molecules, 
atoms and electrons.

THE PALACE WE LIVE IN 
(THE Five SENSEs) 
: MONG the many marvelous creations marking 
the goodness of God we must consider the 
. human body or movable house with which we 
are so intimately associated. It may be called the acme 
of His creative genius. 
Within this palace we find all the passions, joys, loves, 
aspirations and hopes of life mingled with all the appeals 
of His abounding creations, now to the finer and nobler 
impulses, then to the more sordid and lower instincts, all 
surging as it were as the waves of the sea, but finally 
calming down to the quiet equilibrium of peace. 
. Man is made more noble for the storms through which 
she. passes and better prepared for the higher and_larger 
wsduties of life. The buffeting may leave marks as the 
scars of the sculptor’s chisel, but each blow brings out 
more clearly the finer fiber and perfect form. 
This Palace is featured by movable foundations with 
self-sustaining automatic appliances for building, while 
at the same time it tears down the waste of life and with 
censors so keenly and finely adjusted that only the mind 
of creative genius would dare to proclaim it “ mine.” 
When we look at the fine adaptations, the powers of 
assimilation, the gathering up of the particles making 
for health and happiness, and clearly discriminating them 
from the waste and refuse of the Palace, we marvel. 
Then when we further discern the keenness of instinct 
55 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
    
56 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
and the lightning rapidity of action, the positive exact- 
ness with which the various organs function, each assist- 
ing the other and working with such elegant precision in 
all movements, we again wonder. 
What fine adaptations found in the eye, ear, touch, 
taste and smell, with their sensations abounding in delights 
and utilities—ad infinitum—not only for enjoyment, but 
as censors and preservers of life. At the same time, the 
mind, with its wonderful mechanism and _ perception, 
hovers over and directs the activities of the Palace. In 
this wonderful power of mind we see it functioning with 
distinct features. 
We have inquisitiveness sending out feelers as de- 
tectives to search out the minutest detail in their quest 
for knowledge and fact. 
We have also the feature acquisitiveness and retention 
as memory which husbands and stores away all the facts 
and findings of the search. 
Then the faculty of aspiration which exercises imagina- 
tion and penetration, reaching out in prospect and vision 
even to the Infinite. 
Then with all these fine functions we see a splendid 
adaptation and relation as manifest in the family life. 
The father is formed, strong, fleet of foot, compact of 
body, built to contend with the elements and to bring in 
food for the family. The wife and mother formed to 
meet the conditions of motherhood, to nourish and care 
for the helpless child. The child, utterly dependent upon 
the father and mother, finds affection of the family im- 
mediately developed to meet the new conditions of life. 
The family is cemented by love’s bands to suit the new 
and various relationships. 
Having considered in a general way the Palace we 
live in, we come to look more closely at certain specific
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE PALACE WE LIVE IN BT 
parts to see how they show the wisdom and goodness 
of God. 
These outstanding features are commonly called “ The 
Five Senses ”—Touch, Sight, Hearing, Taste, and Smell, 
are the outstanding in life’s conceptions. 
The feelings may cover in a general way the whole 
nervous system, including the sensations of all the other 
senses, but specifically the system by which we recognize 
pain, pleasure, and all those sensations which act upon 
the whole body. These measure the approach of danger 
from without, such as cold, heat, and immediate contact 
causing either pain or pleasure, also dangers from within 
which may be noted by suffering of special organs of the 
body, marked by pain, languid or debilitated condition. 
The senses may be likened to censors to warn the King 
within the Palace of specific dangers and with warnings 
almost audible to guard the parts involved. Auto- 
matically and involuntarily nature lends first aid to all 
injured parts in way of rush of blood to coagulate and 
repair the wound. Then the whole palace is astir, pro- 
viding ways and means to heal the damaged parts. 
Hands, feet, eyes, ears and even smelling are brought 
into play in these activities and movements. 
After the general sense of Touch, we have the sense 
of Sight, the one employed most incessantly in guarding 
the Palace in its movements during our waking hours to 
avoid contact in the changing positions, in its relation to 
other bodies which might endanger the whole or part. 
It is just as careful to protect the other senses as to pro- 
vide for its own safety or the safety of the whole body. 
Besides functioning as a censor, it also provides 
means by which treatment of the various parts may be 
secured. It leads the way to the physician, helps him in 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  58 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
preparing his remedies, watches the clock to note the 
times for applications, and notes change of conditions. 
Having done all this in providing help for the Palace, 
the Eye, in its relations and activities, provides so much 
pleasure to the body that the whole Palace moves with 
eagerness to comply with every suggestion. The tourist 
will scale the highest Alps to view the picturesque beau- 
ties which nature provides among the mountains of 
Switzerland. They will endure the burning sands of 
the desert and the ices of the arctics to view the won- 
ders of nature and creation. They will gladly challenge 
the uncertainties of the ocean, storms and raging seas to 
gain a glimpse of the Orient or Occident. 
The dress of the various nations, with their many col- 
oured garb, is an unending delight to tourists in their 
quest for change and beauty. 
In commercial, industrial and social relations the Eye 
provides the great essential for utilities and pleasure. 
The moving picture, the evening dress, the pictures of 
the home, in fact all the beauties of nature, make appeal 
to the eye and come under the dominion of the sense of 
sight. 
Next in order we may consider the sense of Hearing 
manifesting our Great Creator’s care. 
Much of life is bound up in the pleasures resulting 
from this sense. Music, one of the abounding delights 
and helps in all social, patriotic and religious gatherings, 
supplies man with exhilarations lifting him at times to 
ecstatic vision. 
Among the utilities of this sense we find a large func- 
tion in industrial, commercial and social life. In indus- 
trial environment it may be among the swiftly moving 
machinery of the factory or mill. Here, tons of white- 
hot iron in form of ingots or rails may be pushed and
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE PALACE WE LIVE IN 59 
hauled among the workmen in uncovered torso, where 
the hum and buzz of the wheels and cogs give warning 
of their unrelenting activities. They almost sing as they 
revel in their motions, now crunching and now pressing 
between their iron jaws tons of red-hot steel which 
seethes, writhes, twists, and then, as the saltpetre is 
thrown in, comes the explosion. As if shot, the serpent- 
like form lies conquered as a fallen foe. To appreciate 
these movements so lifelike, yet so unrelenting, one 
must have the complete power of all the senses. A 
failure to hear a whistle or note a sign might cause an 
explosion, spelling complete destruction of the mill or 
whole process. 
Among the many delights and pleasures of life are 
found, in nature’s provision for pleasure, the singing of 
the birds, the roar of the waterfall as it leaps and roars 
over the great Niagara, or the precipices of Yosemite, 
or the geysers of Yellowstone as they reach their white 
arms towards the clouds, amid the many coloured shales 
which speak of glacier, fire and waters past. Or we 
may hear the pounding of the waves of the Pacific as 
they break against the rocks as sentinels off the coast of 
California, all these mark a part of life’s joys to those 
who are born with the wanderlust spirit, or are trained 
in the art of travel. 
The music of the ages in songs of religious or patriotic 
fervour can only be appreciated by the functioning of 
this sense and training the ear to the harmonies of 
music; or in social life as we refer to Shakespeare’s 
Romeo and Juliet, and note the inspiration added to 
song by lyre; and in martial air, the added zest of pa- 
triotic fervour begotten by the National Anthem or as 
the boys sang “Over There”; or in religious worship 
as the inspiration gathers in fervour as the soloist or the 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
60 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
  congregation reaches the appealing tones and notes, add- 
ing visions and glimpses like unto Jacob’s ladder reach- 
ing up to heaven. 
We next take up the sense of Taste as showing the 
wisdom and goodness of God. 
This sense, especially useful and filling a large place 
in the happiness of mankind, is furnished, as it were, 
with a body-guard in order that its functionings may be 
keener and its censorship more complete. The little 
white guards in the way of teeth are ready to challenge 
every intruder and require him to be searched or dis- 
sected as if fearing lest a particle should trespass with- 
out giving the countersign or being washed in the salivas 
of purification before admission to the Palace or holy 
place. 
Besides the little white guards, the sense of Taste is 
assisted by the sense of Smell, which would require the 
candidate to give its age and render account of its asso- 
ciations before being admitted to the sacred precincts of 
friendly relations. So intense is the exhilaration result- 
ing from the exercise of this sense of taste that men 
delight in associating it with special hours of enjoyment. 
At a supper or dinner, served with seasonable viands or 
delicious condiments, men are more susceptible to social 
influences under the spell of this sense. Often the 
grumpy and grouchy will throw off their feeling leaning 
to the blue or ultra violet and move up to the warmer and 
more cheerful side of the spectrum close to the red or 
orange shades of good fellowship. 
The eye, as well as the sense of smell, lies close to 
this sense in many of its relations. The luscious and 
beautifully coloured fruits, with their appeal to the eye, 
bring to the vestibule of the palate secretions or saliva 
suggesting desire to revel in refreshing juices. It may
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE PALACE WE LIVE IN 61 
be the peach, plum or melon, or any one of the many 
other tempting fruits which figure so largely in the his- 
tory of the race, with appeals most compelling. Adam 
said, “The woman thou gavest me gave me to eat.” 
This sense, commonly called Appetite, may also be edu- 
cated to a point of intensity with appeal so potent that 
the man so affected must employ the highest faculties of 
his being, reason and will, to control this ‘sense. 
But the wisdom of a wise Providence is again mani- 
fested in giving man this reserve force to protect and 
guard him against over-indulgence. 
The appetite has played a large part in the history of 
the race according to Biblical account. In whatever way 
we may consider the scene in the Garden, we note that 
the great appeals were first to the senses, then to the 
mind which takes up the findings of the senses, weighs, 
wishes and wills. The combination of appeals to desire 
appeared to break down the barriers of restriction and 
opened the door of self-indulgence, which always leads 
to violation of law. 
Again in the history of mankind we see the appeal and 
push of the appetite urging man -to violate the laws of 
heritage and tradition when Esau, worn and hungry, 
came in from the hunt and saw the tempting pottage 
which his brother Jacob had prepared. The appeal of 
appetite was so great that Esau, in his weak and unap- 
preciative mood, bartered his birthright for the mess of 
pottage, turning as it were the future channel of the race 
from the weakness of self-indulgence personified in Esau 
to the higher and more spiritual life personified by Jacob 
in self-control. The racial accomplishments of Esau’s 
line never approximated to the wonderful reaches of 
power and progress which followed the line of Jacob. 
When the tests came to the Great Teacher, one was   
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
also along this line. When hungry and weary the appeal 
was made to appetite. 
“Grant that these stones shall be made bread.” 
From these references we see the moral lessons: 
Self-indulgence leads to violation of law and moral 
weakness ; self-control leads to progress, prosperity and 
higher spiritual life. The former to be avoided as the 
appetite for alcoholic beverages which leads to disease 
and vice; the latter, self-control, leads to progress, health 
and happiness. 
The sense of smell is next to be considered as mani- 
festing the goodness of God. 
This sense finds a large place among the activities of 
man in assisting the other senses in censoring foods and 
viands, contributing to life’s joys and happiness. It also 
is one of prime importance in detecting odours, gases 
and fumes which are injurious and pernicious in their 
effects upon the Palace we live in. 
Smoke or fumes arising from smouldering fires or the 
combustion causing loss of life and property are often 
sensed by smell in time to prevent a spread of flame by 
notice to the other senses to awake to the dangers immi- 
nent. The house, theatre, church, hospital or asylum 
may be threatened by smouldering fire when this life- 
like censor, with keen appreciation of danger, calls the 
whole Palace to arouse all hands to action with every 
ounce of energy brought into play in combating the en- 
croaching flames. Unnumbered lives and _ property 
beyond computation have been saved by the faithfulness 
of this little sentinel. Its activities penetrate garret, cel- 
lar and dome, hospital ward and laboratory, and the 
chancel of church to ferret out the origin of danger. 
The church or theatre full of people, the asylum or 
hospital with suffering soldiers and orphans caught with-
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE PALACE WE LIVE IN 63 
out other warning finds first aid and a friendly helper 
as it scents danger afar off. It penetrates not only the 
odours and fumes of combustions, but goes under hill 
and mountain with the miner and throws around him 
the cloak of protection from poisonous and noxious 
gases which infest the mines. This sense of smell also 
penetrates the sewer and carrion spots where dangerous 
gases threaten the lives of men and families. The dog, 
ferret and vulture often lead the way of man in the quest 
for hunted objects, as these can more readily run down 
their prey or objects of food. 
As we study the senses in their relation to each other, 
we must note the great purpose served in their combina- 
tion and association together as they co-operate in their 
activities. 
The Biblical writer says: “ The eye cannot say to the 
hand I have no need of thee, nor again the head to the 
feet I have no need of you,” but all the various parts are 
built together forming a compact whole. 
So we have team work exemplified in the functions 
of all the senses. We see their great accomplishments 
in athletics, industrial, social and political life in the 
splendid co-operation of all the parts involved. 
Betts says: “A more complete study of sensation re- 
veals nearly three times this number. The body is 
equipped with more than a dozen different kinds of end- 
organs, each prepared to receive its own particular kind 
of stimulus.” However, we cannot enter into a detail 
discussion at this time. 
The palace fine, the Rex so keen, 
The conscience all combined, 
Place man upon a pedestal 
With genius, power, enshrined.

Foundations ever moving, 
Articulations, ducts and oils, 
And lubrication showing. 
Each joint and socket in its place, 
They challenge wisdom’s lotion, 
And show the structure, bones, and flesh,

ology in the chapter on the senses, but we can look 
further into the subject and inquire more in detail 
as to the manifestations of the goodness of God as we 
study the harmonious articulations, the assimilations, the 
purposes and placements of the various parts of the 
human body. 
In building a house we see that the foundations are 
substantial and of strong and firm material. We note the 
general contour including form, frame, placement of the 
parts to accord with the purposes of their functions, and 
we finally look for the figure to have a pleasing effect 
upon the eye. 
As we look over the human frame and diagnose the 
various parts and the functions each is expected to serve, 
we marvel at the fine adaptations of the various organs 
to the rdle they are to play in life’s drama. 
The movable foundations are constructed with bone 
and sinewy muscles, with articulations at the various joints 
adapted to the elastic and quick rapid movements of the 
whole frame; the feet, toes, knees and ankles are suited 
and lubricated by nature’s wise provision through invol- 
untary and automatic ducts working continuously to pro- 
vide the necessary oils for all purposes and eventualities. 
The toés are not where the heel is required, in position to 
receive the heavy weight of the whole frame to which it 
is adapted and in place best suited. The ankles, knees 
65 I N a measure we have treated some phases of Physi-
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
and all joints are supplied with articular cartilage as a 
cushion to receive and break the shocks of every move- 
ment. And the heavy cushion of the heels, together with 
the joints, serve to support the frame in a soft muscular 
socket. The whole, from the nail, serving as protection 
to the toe, to the knee-cap furnishing a shield to the joint, 
all work together in a harmonious combination to serve 
locomotion and rapid movement of the body. 
Then as we move to the other larger parts and note 
the hip joints and large bones which serve to steady the 
body, to support the heavy automatic machinery of the 
digestive system, the generative, pneumatic and circulatory 
systems, we marvel. And as we see the complexity yet 
the harmonious movement as each part functions as if 
guided by a subconscious mind to perform the special 
task, we again wonder. 
We note the spinal column with its numerous vertebrae, 
each articulated and united in a manner to serve not only 
as a support to the cranial system, but as a protection to 
the nervous system incased within, all working in accord 
with the great and evident purpose of serving the whole 
human mechanism in a manner most marvelous. 
If we would go further and consider the nervous sys- 
tem, the circulatory, pneumatic and generatve systems 
and their relations to each other, we shall find an out; 
standing expression of God’s goodness. 
The nerves report constantly their findings as they 
stand sentinel over the whole body, giving warning of 
impending danger or giving expressions of pleasure in a 
clear field of joy. 
The circulatory system, including the great power house 
or pump which we call the heart, ever faithful day and 
night, automatically unceasing in its fine functioning of 
driving the blood to every portion of the body, purifying, 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  PHYSIOLOGY 67 
injecting the rich red flow into the remotest crevices of 
the physical man and at the same time carrying off the 
waste particles to their place, 
The pneumatic system as it pulsates, inhales and ex- 
hales the oxygen of the air, placing it within reach of the 
circulatory system to purify the blood as it flows through 
and at the same time throws off the carbon dioxide, the 
waste and rejected parts. 
Then the digestive system as it functions in throwing 
into the circulatory system the health giving particles 
assimilated from the food and casting aside the refuse or 
ashes, ever working and unceasing in its movements to 
promote the highest and best for man. 
The generative system, with parts hidden far away in 
the recesses of the bodily mechanism, protected by the 
heavy hip bones and large abdominal muscles as if nature 
would make sure that reproduction could not fail. 
Then we note the cranial system in which might be in- 
cluded the various senses as they function in their relation 
to the other outstanding systems of the human organism. 
What a wonderful combination of powers and systems 
within this part called the head or cranium. The brain, 
the seat of the mind, the systems of hearing, taste, smell 
and sight, are all centered here within this small compass. 
Yet it is the seat of the directive energy for the whole 
body. Then again we note how these wonderful systems 
are protected by the heavy skull bone as if nature would 
again assure itself that these powers would not evaporate 
or lose their functioning in the great plan of the 
Creator. 
As man has sounded the praises of the glories and 
goodness of God as he has beheld the heavenly bodies 
in their movements, so a pean of joy and admiration 
might be sung when one considers the harmonies, beauties 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
and utilities of God’s creative genius! manifested in the 
wonderful system and combination of systems in the 
physical man endowed with powers of thought and speech 
akin to the Divine. We marvel at the wonderful pro- 
vision for his life and destiny. 
The dermis and epidermis (inner skin and outer skin) 
including the marvelous system of pores to throw off the 
waste of the body in perspiration and exhalations for 
ventilation and purification; also the wonderful system 
of nerves standing as living sentinels to guard against 
dangers, and the whole as a waterproof covering for 
protection. Besides it is said by physicians that in the 
hotter climates of Africa and southern India there is de- 
posited between the inner and outer skins a coloring mat- 
ter which tends to protect the body against the hotter and 
more direct rays of the sun, but causing the peoples of 
these countries to become a color of darker hue. Thus 
we have the various colored races and people of various 
climes. 
The hair with its many cells and roots has its function 
not only in protection of the head but may serve for 
warmth and a general stimulation or strengthening of 
the body. The eyebrows to serve as protection of the 
eyes from perspiration ; the eyelids and eyelashes for pro- 
tection of the eyes, and even the tonsils, which once were 
considered of no special use, are now recognized as hav- 
ing a function which tends to purify the blood flowing 
through them. 
The whole man, consisting of body, mind and spirit, is 
a most marvelous combination of systems co-ordinating, 
co-operating and functioning to work out the highest 
good for man. In this we can certainly see that all parts 
work together for good as these respond to natural in- 
stincts, subconscious or directive mind, and as they come

under control of the higher powers of the complete man 
with conscience clear and purpose pure. 
One of the great industrial managers of our country 
and an outstanding engineer, musing and writing upon 
the mechanism and functions of the human body, which 
is termed “The Miracle of Miracles,” writes a pen pic- 
ture in these words: “We engineers are apt to forget 
that the human body is the most wonderful work of en- 
gineering in the world. As a plant it is more complex 
than the largest works in existence. Take the digestive 
tract, the lymphatic system, framework of bones, the in- 
numeral muscle motors, the co-ordinating functions per- 
formed by the liver and other internal organs. And, to 
go a step further, take the sensatory departments. How 
about the wonderful optical plant in which colored mov- 
ing-pictures are instantly taken and developed? How 
about the phonographic department where the sound 
vibrations are received, recorded and reproduced. And 
the sense of touch so delicate that the fingers can be 
trained to feel flat spots on a steel ball which are not 
apparent to the eye! 
“ Think of the thousands of functions performed auto- 
matically and those requiring judgment being cared for 
at the same time through other channels. You will agree 
with me surely that the body contains the most elaborate 
organization ever installed in a plant; that its component 
parts are examples of a finer kind of design than we will 
ever approximate and that the functions and their rela- 
tions are co-ordinated more smoothly than we will ever 
be able to arrange in human relations.” 
A prominent statesman commenting on the above pic- 
ture remarks that this great engineer is right and that 
he might have gone further. 
“There are more mysteries in man than there are in

monopoly of intelligence, who call themselves agnostics. 
These doubters could not live an hour if they were left

do it by conscious effort.

How strange:that any “human being shoitld use his time |

J. Asthur Thomson inshis “,Outljne of Science” says: 
“We speak of the body as. a machine, but it is hardly 
necessaty to say that none of the‘most ingenious machines 
set up by modern science can for a moment compare with 
it. The body is a self-stoking, self-regulating, self-repair- 
ing machine—the most marvelous and unique automatic 
mechanism in the universe. 
“Tn modern times a volume could be written on the 
teeth alone, the ivory gates of the body, and it would be a 
remarkable story. The receiving office, so to speak, of 
the mouth, is itself so deeply interesting and so full of 
ingenious contrivances that a whole section of this work 
might be devoted to it. Above the mouth are the sen- 
tinels, the eyes and nose. On the upper surface of the 
tongue there are myriads of sensitive little organs, taste 
buds, ready to apply a final test to the food.”

MIND 
ness of God we see in the mind of man a benign 
purpose most wonderful and inestimable. In all the 
physical, mental and spiritual movements and their rela- 
tions the activities of the Mind are outstanding. In fact 
within the conceptions of mind are lodged the great 
powers of achievement in all these spheres. 
Man may have a physical body like unto that of 
Apollo and a brain of large proportions and a spiritually 
benign purpose well developed, but without mind to pilot, 
direct and plan all would be little in the affairs of life. 
What then is mind? How does it function? What 
are its relations to the whole man? What purpose does 
it serve? These are questions apropos. 
All psychologists and mental scientists agree that the 
seat of the mind is the brain which functions through 
the nervous system and that mind may be analyzed into 
its known functions, Formerly Mind was divided into 
the activities embraced within intellect, sensibilities and 
will. To-day they may be known as knowing, feeling I: considering the great manifestations of the good- 
and willing. 
In knowing we find power to reason, weigh, calculate 
and discern. 
In feeling, including affection, we realize ability to re- 
ceive impressions and store them in memory as historical 
fact or for immediate use. 
72
-P-A-G-E-73
MIND 73 
In will we find power to put into effect or motion the 
findings of knowledge or intellect which weighs the facts 
and the many impressions from which conclusions ‘are 
made. : : 
The mind in its activities functions through many 
avenues. According to the classifications of mental 
scientists, practically all of life’s conscious activities, 
aside from the involuntary functions involved, are bound 
up within this power called Mind. With conscience as 
a counterpart of mind we have the character which con- 
trols to a very large extent the activities of the physical, 
mental and spiritual life. 
The list of the functions above suggested cover the 
joys, pains and hopes of life. They include thinking, 
reasoning, emotions, memory, perception, association, 
imagination, instinct, habit and will, from which life’s 
findings are gleaned and character is built. 
Without this wonderful instrument given by our Great 
Creator, life would be a void and meaningless. It sleeps, 
it sings, it rejoices, sorrows, busies itself with life’s du- 
ties, hopes for the best and finds its way out of the in- 
tricate mazes of life, bringing and weaving into the 
fabric of life the findings of the research through all 
creation. It reaches up to the starry heavens and asks 
the meaning of this wonderful dome. It digs into the 
earth and would demand a voice from the untold ages, . 
it weaves in and out through the changes of life and 
questions every form of knowledge and imagination. It , 
aspires to the highest and noblest conceptions of God and 
man. It cries with a loud voice for the Infinite through- 
out the vast creation. As the Biblical writer would say, 
“Oh, that I might find Him.” 
In fact without this marvelous instrument the whole 
creation “ would be without form and void.” At every 
ie %

turn it places an interrogation point. It sees in the new- 
born child a being very old at birth, covered with the 
hoary hairs of heredity, possessing and embracing the 
mental powers and potentials of mind of all the ages 
past. 
In all the activities of the physical body we see the 
benign purpose of the Creator as the mind of man directs 
it in all its relationships. In boyhood days at school and 
on the playground as the youngster weaves in and out 
among his playmates, now running, jumping, wrestling, 
playing ball or in the swimming pool, the little monitor 
coaches, plans and parries for every movement; and 
later, in business life, amid the strains and turmoils of 
time, he does not linger or halt when action is de- 
manded. 
The little girl may be found rolling hoop, fixing dolly’s 
clothes, painting pictures or planning party, all under the 
directions and supervision of this secret, invisible crea- 
tion called Mind. And later, among the never-ending 
demands of social and domestic life, even until old age, 
when the physical body is withering and the foundations 
are unsteady, this faithful servant stands ready to guide 
even to the brink of death, and finally say good-by with- 
out even a thank you for its lifelong care and pro- 
tection. 
The only rest required for all the labour of love is 
slumber’s sweet repose as the physical body in sleep re- 
news its potential energy and prepares for the activities 
of the new day. Even then, during the sleeping hours, 
it can be depended upon to sense the coming of the light, 
and as a sentinel responds to and announces the resurrec- 
tion and the gift of the new day. 
It not only guides the physical body through life, but 
in its mental activities absorbs from the wonderful crea-
-P-A-G-E-75
  MIND : 15 
tion around, from the experiences through which it 
passes, a foundation of faith in the higher and nobler 
and spiritual conceptions, running concurrent with all 
life. The lower gives way to the higher, the physical 
decays and passes, but the spiritual realities, absorbed 
under the spell of life’s vicissitudes, are enlarged as 
things seen, fade and give place to the unseen. The 
mind lingers with the Palace until the whole is swal- 
lowed up in spiritual vision. The body decays, but the 
mind with the new vision may be quickened. We may 
exclaim with the Biblical writer: “Death is swallowed 
up in victory.” 
As we further consider Mind in its relations we must 
note the large part it plays in the affairs of life, giving 
ecstatic joy in pleasant memories of friends, functions, 
and associations, bringing before our minds visions of the 
past; as age grows upon us with these memories clearly 
defined it lays a foundation of hope for the future in en- 
larged anticipation of a joyous immortality. 
How the memory leads us back in middle life and old 
age to the scenes of childhood and youth, ever lending 
its reflections to brighten the path of life even when ad- 
verse conditions throw their shadow athwart and con- 
front our movements. As the poet Moore says: 
“When time who steals our years away 
Shall steal our pleasures too 
The memories of past will stay 
And half our joys renew.” 
Again, as George H. Betts says in his book, “The 
Mind and Its Education”: “A good mind is an asset 
on which the owner realizes anew each succeeding day.” 
Having considered the Mind and the various senses, 
we must look into the Palace to see the King. What is 
His character? And how does He serve?
-P-A-G-E-76
  76 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
The mind and conscience of man form a combination 
to control the Palace. These are interwoven so that 
they function together marking the character. The 
senses respond to every call and order of their King. 
The nervous system made up of thousands of little senti- 
nels report with lightning speed every approach of dan- 
ger or carry forward the messages and orders of the 
King. They may be likened to little servants ready at 
the beck and call of the Master of the House to perform 
His bidding. Through these little bodies, figuratively 
speaking, operating through the muscles and nerves, the 
whole body moves and functions according to the man- 
date of the King. It moves from place to place or directs 
the activities of the various parts; and even the senses 
bow in obedience to His call. 
Tf you would take for consideration the various mem- 
bers, such as hands, feet, arms, legs, and their func- 
tions, you will see that perfect harmony reigns within 
and without, and all are obedient to his will. The King 
may be a perfect man with physique reduced to form, 
so to speak, with limbs lithe, muscles strong, nerves calm, 
and mind radiant with optimism and conscience clear, 
forming a perfect specimen of life, harmony and form. 
Having this fine combination known as Man, full of 
life and vigour, the goodness of God is manifest in plac- 
ing within the functions of this wonderful Palace and 
kingdom the power of propagation, reproduction and 
continuation of the wonderful gift of life. All nature, 
as we see it in the heavenly bodies, with its wonderful 
laws and activities in space, the earth with its wonder- 
ful provision, to nourish; all vegetable life with its won- 
derful laws bowing to man’s hand; and returning seasons 
with gifts innumerable, all chemical laws with provision 
for tools, machinery, communication and transportation,
-P-A-G-E-77
  MIND, 7 
all move together to make this world, as it were, the 
Garden of the Gods, providing for man the Acme of 
His creations. Paul says: “The whole creation groan- 
eth and travaileth awaiting the coming of the sons of 
God.” 
The wonderful power of conscience is seen in the 
great struggle depicted by Victor Hugo in “Les Mise- 
rables,” when the hero, Jean Valjean, is brought face to 
face with the great issue of life. It has been called the 
Battle Royal, as follows: 
“The old formidable struggle of which we have al- 
ready spoken began once more— Unheard of conflict’ 
now takes place—at certain moments the foot slips; at 
another moment the ground crumbles away under foot. 
“ How many times has Conscience, made for the good, 
clasped and overthrown him (Jean Valjean). How 
many times had the truth set her knee inexorable upon 
his breast and he had begged for mercy. He had come 
to the supreme crossing of Good and Evil. 
“Good and evil stand behind the severe interrogation 
point. What are you going to do? demands the Sphinx. 
One is never done with conscience. 
“*Make your choice, Brutus; make your choice, 
Cato.’ It is fathomless since it is God. 
“One flings into that well the labour of one’s whole 
life; one flings in one’s fortune—one flings in one’s 
riches—one flings in one’s success. One flings in one’s 
liberty—or fatherland—one flings in one’s well-being— 
one flings in one’s repose—one flings in one’s joy. More, 
more, more, empty the vase, tip the urn. One must finish 
by flinging in one’s heart. 
“The obedience of matter is limited to friction. Is 
there no limit to the obedience of the soul? If per- 
petual motion is impossible, can perpetual self-sacrifice  
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
be exacted? (This is evidently the begging of the soul 
for relief from conscience.) Martyrdom is sublimation 
—corrosive sublimation. 
“Jean Valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion. 
He was as motioniess as a corpse, while his thoughts 
wallowed on the earth and soared: Now like the hydra, 
now like the eagle.” “Have a thread in my heart which 
holds me fast.” It is when one is old that that sort of 
thread is particularly solid. “And life falls in ruin 
around it.” (Conscience.) 
“T have tried to break that thread; I have jerked at 
it, it would not break. I tore my heart with it, then I 
said I cannot live without it. Then I said I cannot live 
anywhere else than here.” ‘“ You ask me what has forced 
me to speak? A very old thing, my conscience. To hold 
my peace was very easy. But there are two things in 
which I have not succeeded in breaking the thread that 
holds me, fixed, riveted and sealed here by my heart or 
in silencing some one who speaks softly to me when 
alone.” 
It was the voice which spoke to Elijah, to Adam. It 
spoke to Jean Valjean. 
“Tt is not enough to be happy—one must be content.” 
“There is a silence which lies. An awakened con- 
science is grandeur of soul. The workman was horrible, 
but the work was admirable. God produces His miracles 
as seem good to Him.” 
The conscience then is the final arbiter. As one 
writer, Stanisfer, has said: “Conscience is the silent 
witness that testifies at every trial of life.” 
As before suggested—Conscience and mind, so closely 
associated, together in the character of man function as 
a personality, as a King in the Palace. He collects his 
data, weighs, dissects, analyzes, discriminates, adjusts
-P-A-G-E-79
MIND 79 
and reconstructs in his functions of thinking. As Dr. 
George H. Betts says: “ All true thinking is for the pur- 
pose of discovering relations between things we think 
about. What a chaos it would be! We might per- 
ceive, remember and imagine all the various objects we 
please, but without the power to think them through to- 
gether they would all be totally unrelated, and hence have 
no meaning.” 
Since we must think of all things in their relation to 
some other person or object there must follow a recogni- 
tion in these relations of individuality and form. 
Yet in considering the wonderful wisdom and good- 
ness of God in the association of mind, conscience and 
personality we have not yet arrived at the greatest mani- 
festation of this combination until we embrace within its 
scope the powers and potentials of love, which appears 
to be different from ordinary feeling or friendly affec- 
tion. Love has been described in a wonderful word 
picture by St. Paul, and may be called the acme of his 
genius and his masterpiece. 
t. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, 
And have not Love, I am become as sounding brass, 
And a tinkling cymbal. 
2. And though I have the gift of prophecy, 
And understand all mysteries and all knowledge; 
And though I have all faith so that I could remove moun- 
tains, 
And have not Love, I am nothing. 
3. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, 
And though I give my body to be burned 
And have not Love, it profiteth me nothing. 
4. Love suffereth long and is kind; 
Love envieth not; 
Love vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.

5. Doth not behave itself unseemly, 
Seeketh not her own, 
Is not easily provoked, ‘ 
Bon Thinketh no evil. 
6. Rejoicing not in iniquity, but rejoicing in the truth. 
7. Beareth all things, 
Believeth all things, 
Hopeth all things, 
Endureth all things. 
8. Love never faileth, 
But whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; 
Whether there be tongues they shall cease; 
Whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away. 
' 
9. For we know in part and we prophecy in part. 
10. But when that which is perfect is come, 
Then that which is in part shall be done away. 
11. When I was a child, I spake as a-child, 
I understood as a child, I thought as a child, 
But when I became a man I put away childish things. 
12. For now we see through a glass darkly 
But then face to face 
Now I know in part, 
But then shall I know even also as I am known. 
13. And now abideth Faith, Hope, Love, these three, 
But the greatest of these is: Love. 
Victor Hugo also emphasizes the wonderful power 
and value of love, and gives it tht highest place in his 
| conception of life. 
: “Tf people did not love each other I really do not sce 
what use there’ would be in having any springtime, and 
for my part I should pray the good God to shut up all 
the beautiful things that He shows us. 
“Love is the only ecstasy, all the rest weeps. To love

. 
or to have loved this suffices. Demand nothing more. 
' No other pearl can be found in the shadowy folds of 
life. 
“ To love is a fulfillment.” 
In whatever way we may think of man, science tells: 
us that “He stands unique and apart. With all his 
faults he has his ethical face set in the right direction. « 
The main line of movement is toward the fuller embodi- 
ment of the beautiful, the true and the good, in healthy 
lives which are increasingly a satisfaction to them- 
selves.” THOMSON.

INDIVIDUALITY AND FORM | 
fare of mankind we must take up the findings of 
science along mental and physical lines. 
The Biblical writer says: “The earth was without 
form and void.” In other words, the creation must have 
been in a dim and obscure existence; no light, no vision, 
no form or shape by which to distinguish separate entity. 
And darkness was everywhere, suggesting that there was 
no visual or mental conception distinguishing individual- 
ity and form. 
How then do we obtain form? Why form and for 
what purpose? How does individuality contribute to the 
welfare of mankind? These are questions which would 
naturally follow the suggestion of “without form and 
void.” Betts says: “All true thinking is for the purpose 
of discovering relations between things we think about. 
What a chaos it would be! We might perceive, remem- 
ber and imagine all the various objects we please, but 
without the power to think them through together they 
would all be totally unrelated, and hence have no mean- 
ing.” 
As we saw under the chapter devoted to Chemistry, 
our Creator, having created the Heavens and Earth, then 
provided laws for the preservation of man upon the 
earth, such as the laws of life within the seed for propa- 
gation and fruits abundant, like to produce like. He also 
provided the laws of chemistry for man that he might 
82 i consideration of Form as contributing to the wel-
-P-A-G-E-83
INDIVIDUALITY AND FORM 83 
co-operate with the Creator in working out the highest 
good, for the race. But without mental conception all 
would be void as suggested by Betts. 
As the laws of all creation, as far as known to man, 
were evidently made for the development and welfare of 
man, so we may assume that, with this benign purpose 
in the mind of God, provision was made for the breaking 
up of the great void through the laws of mental concep- 
tion, physics and chemistry. These laws, such as affini- 
ties, adhesion, cohesion, repulsion and expulsion, etc., 
operating upon the various basic principles of matter 
made them to find individuality and form within space, 
bringing out the individual characteristics of each, and 
bringing to view upon the horizon the known entities as 
we have them to-day. 
As we dissolve, separate or unite and purify elements 
by means of heat and light, we may anticipate the find- 
ings made upon the gaseous mass called “ void” when 
the great sun first poured forth its shafts of light and 
heat upon the dark mass. What a sense of power and 
majesty in the command! What a movement of mass, 
form and figure as every particle microscopic, telescopic, 
seen and unseen moved in mass formation or individual 
file to its own place, each particle as it were set apart,—a 
form within the mass or individual figure with unnum- 
bered particles comprised within the whole. Or it may 
be the whole of nature embracing within its bosom the 
great basic elements, earth, air, fire, water and ether, 
moved in turn in majestic splendour at the command of 
God. Much of creation is still “ without form and void” 
as far as man is concerned as he may not understand and 
perceive the relations of individuality and form. 
Form and figure were then evidently conceived and 
pronounced as good for the welfare of mankind when the  
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
dark mass called void was broken up and separated into 
elements, persons and particles, and were differentiated 
by individual propensities or affinities. As God in the 
creation of light, the complement of vision, has adjusted 
it in all its functions to bring to man’s notice the various 
forms and figures of creation as he may be able to com- 
prehend them; so that from the dust and crystal in the 
sand to the highest forms of creation, the beauty of 
nature is marked by form and figure. The leaves of the 
forest, the fish of the sea, the shapes of fruits and flowers, 
the stars of the heavens, the mountains snow-capped or 
sunlit, the flowing stream or the vast ocean bearing on 
its bosom the commerce of nations; even lava flowing 
from volcanic peak call forth our admiration as form and 
figure loom forth and each is marked as an individual 
entity. 
And when we come to the animal creation, our nature’s 
closer kin, we find individuality and form playing a part 
in life’s drama, a rdle to cause delight. But as we higher 
scale Creation’s lofty peaks, horizon large, to view the 
best of nature’s gifts to man, one we see transcendent 
in her beauty, curves and shapes which none surpass, and 
all accord the place preeminent. 
In life’s great purpose, initiative, and higher joys, man 
needs her clasp of hand, to help as helpmeets can with 
cheering voice, approving eye, with face and form 
divine. 
So, as we further view creation in mineral, animal and 
human forms, we can see the beautiful adjustments, 
adaptations, powers of assimilation and all with purpose 
to work out for man the highest good. If he needs 
food, the earth and air and gaseous mist conjure to- 
gether, as he tickles the soil, to make abundant contribu- 
tion to his lawful needs,
-P-A-G-E-85
  INDIVIDUALITY AND FORM 85 
If man wants tools to till the soil for food, the laws of 
chemistry alike conspire to produce the plow, harrow, 
reaper and harvester. If he desires earnestly the other 
gifts of larger form he moulds the steel and iron into a 
system of transportation with cars and locomotive, with 
power. If he needs yet the quicker means of communica- 
tion and knocks at nature’s door with the ear close for 
answer, he finds the wires and telephone and radio sys- 
tems, answering to his knock with responsive voice 
approving. 
And if aloft, he fain would soar upon his vessel frail, 
He finds the means, the motor forms, and headlight for the 
trail, 
Above the mist, above the clouds, and higher still he strives, 
The goal is reached, he earthward glides, again at home arrives, 
But should he sense some higher goals, which in his visions 
beck, 
He gathers hope and forms of grace upon the vessel’s deck, 
To these he adds the man complete for soul’s eternal quest, 
He takes the ship of Faith and Love and sails above the rest. 
For identification, individuality, variety, which is “ the 
spice of life,” forms, figure and weight, all were created 
to conform to man’s capacity to handle and use them. 
Form, figure, and all parts of man’s own physical body 
are made symmetrical to conform to and articulate with 
the other parts, also to make a harmonious whole. 
All things must work together for good. “Man does 
not gather grapes of thorns, and figs of thistles.” But all 
things conforming to reasonable law, work in conjunction 
with, and articulate with other parts of the whole of which 
they are a part. Right here we must notice the law of 
form as it may be related to our general welfare; all 
parts and individual relations are articulated for their
-P-A-G-E-86
  \ 
86 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
purpose. The mountain and the mouse are so incongru- 
ous in their relations there is no need for argument. 
So we see the beauty of form and figure as we more 
closely study them in their proper relations. The hand 
is shaped to perform the work of the hand and to wash 
the other hand. The foot likewise must articulate in 
unison with the other foot and to function in the sphere 
to which it is adapted. Likewise all the other organs of 
the body. 
The laws of relationship and adaptation are certainly 
the great laws which speak for harmony as they touch 
man in their various relations in the physical, mental and 
spiritual world. The toe is not where the head is because 
in form and structure it could not perform the function 
of the head, and foot cannot take the place of brain be- 
cause in form and structure it is axiomatically out of 
place and adaptation. 
So thus in utility and adaptations of life Form plays 
a large part in the affairs of man looking to his happiness. 
When we approach the vegetable kingdom we see form 
and figure filling a large place. The appeal of form to 
the eye and sense of beauty is seen in the apple, peach, 
plum, in form and colour to suit the relations of the fruit 
to man, his sense of taste, and in form convenient to 
handle. 
So, in all relations, form and figure must have their ap- 
peal either as individual entities or in their relation to other 
objects of creation besides having their relations to the 
whole of creation. All must articulate and function for 
the welfare of mankind in all these relations. 
In animal life we see that the horse, dog, cat, have just 
such figures as are adapted to the functions of each. 
In the family life the infant is adapted in size and form 
to suit the relationship. The mother and father with
-P-A-G-E-87
  INDIVIDUALITY AND FORM st 
natures and dispositions very different are yet adapted 
to the life and environment in which each is presumed 
to function. The young man or woman full of life and 
vigour finds joy and pleasure in the society of youth and 
in forms of life which suit them, but do not appeal to 
other members of the family. 
So in all our relationships form and figure find a re- 
ciprocal appeal to suit the individual life or character. 
In the world of science, as chemistry, geology, botany 
and in the study of these sciences, we find form and 
figure used, as necessity may require. Each is adapted 
to the sphere in which it functions. 
For the physical, mental and spiritual development of 
mankind, it is essential that individuality, identity and 
differentiation of character be recognized else all would 
be a conglomeration of creation as at first when it was 
declared “ without form and void.” 
Character of man is reflected by form in facial ex- 
pression, carriage of body and even steadiness of the eye. 
The criminal of long experience bears the mark of dissi- 
pation in face and form unmistakable to close observa- 
tion. 
An artist desiring to paint a picture representing char- 
acter clean, pure, untarnished by crime and dissipation, 
selected from a group of children, one with boyish, bright, 
innocent face. After painting the picture, the artist hung 
it upon the wall of his studio. The picture attracted the 
attention and admiration of many visitors to his studio. 
Twenty years after the same artist decided to paint a 
companion picture, depicting character in contrast with 
the angelic picture on the wall. He came upon a man 
with features, crime marked by years of vice, and had him 
sit for the picture. After the artist painted the picture, 
the man noticed the beautiful boyish face on the wall and
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LIFE 
stood before it. He then remarked that, just twenty 
years before, he, as a boy, had sat for that picture. The 
artist noting the faint resemblance amid the marked con- 
trast of feature, recognized him as the boy of twenty years 
ago. Crime and time had featured the great contrast 
between the boy with unsullied character and beautiful 
countenance and the man of dissipated life bearing the 
marks of vice of twenty years. 
Without form and figure to mark identity, place, indi- 
viduality, also to feature character and events, life would 
lose all charm and man would be merged into a life of 
outer darkness. If one would desire to paint a picture 
representing the lost of mankind it would be only neces- 
sary to vision him as back in outer darkness, in the first 
stage of existence. 
Evidently the great work of creation is still going on 
and the major purpose is to differentiate man from man 
by marks of character. 
In fact this appears to be the outstanding feature of 
the picture of the Great Teacher when he said: “ The 
light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth 
it not,” and “ Ye are the light of the world.” 
As the sun diffused and broke up the void or physical 
mass at creation’s dawn and by the laws of individuality 
sent each to its own place, so those who hold up the light 
of life, diffusing the light through the darkness of char- 
acter mass will bring out the best of life to continue “as 
gold tried in the fire.” 
“The righteous shall shine as the light,” shall be 
marked with individuality, stamped by character.

TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. “The earth was without form and void.” Why form and 
individuality? 
2. Chaos without individuality and form. 
3. The separation of the void mass into individual parts and 
forms—light and heat as factors, and mind as necessary for 
realization of individuality and form. 
4. All forms and shapes with individuality adapted to functions 
of each. Forms in mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. 
5. The laws of chemistry assisting man in moulding and pro- 
ducing tools, machinery for agriculture, business and general 
commercial life. 
6. Beauty and utilities of form. Adaptation of form and figure 
to functions of each. 
7. Character marked by figure and form—illustration. Life 
uninteresting without individuality and form. 
8. The outstanding purpose of all teaching to bring out char- 
acter marked by lines of light and right.

tribute to the welfare of mankind, we must now 
take up the study of Sociglogy or social science, 
which treats of the constitution, phenomena and develop- 
ment of human society or relationships. 
From the earliest history of the race man has been a 
social animal. It was announced by the Biblical writer 
that “It is not good for man to be alone.” Probably the 
greatest punishment which can be imposed upon a man 
is solitary confinement, often imposed upon recalcitrant 
criminals in penitentiaries. So the creation of man and 
provision for his highest enjoyments, also for his pres- 
ervation, call for companionship and association. A 
man or woman having no companion will find large com- 
fort in calling in the bird, cat, dog, or some other domes- 
tic animal to share his companionship or loneliness and 
find much joy in mingling with these creatures of God’s 
wondrous creation. 
Having this trait woven within the fiber of our char- 
acter, we must look for the goodness of God in the world 
of social relationships. 
Of course God’s greatest gift to man is woman, from 
whom “Let no man put asunder.” The answer is em- 
phatic and unmistakable. Growing out of this fine asso- 
ciation come the children of the home—then the larger 
association of the family life, then follows the mingling 
of the life-giving stream with other families of congenial 
93 H= considered many of the laws which con-

type and sympathetic aspirations. And as the stream 
spreads out and the channels deepen the normal man 
with the larger and even broadening associations finds 
his chief delight in their companionship. Next to that 
of wife and mother, is the prattle of children of the 
home. 
The ever-changing phases of domestic life with chil- 
dren to come to parents with problems and the childish 
delights expressed as their seniors unravel their knots is 
a vision which an angel might cherish. The picture of 
the child with dolly’s broken shoe asking the shoemaker 
to fix it is both beautiful and impressive. 
After the fine associations of home life we have the 
mingling of the children in school life; and later in re- 
ligious, political and public life, all normally working 
with altruistic purpose for the mutual betterment of all. 
In early historic times the children were not given such 
a large place in society as at the present time. Among 
the less civilized and barbaric tribes babies were sacri- 
ficed and thrown into the Ganges, or under the Jugger- 
naut car. But as man has become more enlightened, and 
as education’s clarifying vision has removed the scales 
from the eyes of society, the joys of life have increased 
and life prolonged. Within the last 30 years the average 
life has been prolonged from 35 to 45 years. 
After the fine family relationships showing the be- 
nign purpose of God, we take a step further and see the 
beautiful associations and friendships formed in the 
world of school life. 
A beautiful picture could be painted of primary school 
life, depicting the feelings and passions flooding the life 
and character of the little boy or girl as he or she leaves 
home the first day for school to mingle with other chil- 
dren of like feelings, amid the fears and trembling of 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
  
SOCIOLOGY 95 
this new life. How will the teacher look? What kind 
of children will be in my class? Who will sit next to 
me? What a rush of questionings and feelings mingled 
with the uncertainties of this life as the little one takes 
courage and marches into the presence of teacher and the 
new child companions? 
One can never forget the pleasant memories of these 
school days with their deep joys and little fears, also the 
deep impressions made as the little folks mingle in class, 
on the playground, and in confidential secret relations 
stirring their little lives as they go in and out weaving 
the threads of life among the mothers, fathers, states- 
men, preachers and teachers of the future. And, alas! 
also among those who will find places behind prison bars, 
in asylums, the dark places of night life and red-light dis- 
trict. No wonder the song “School Days” became so 
popular and took a fast hold on multitudes as it was 
sung behind the footlights and in community gatherings, 
as well as in the slums and places of lowly abode some 
years ago. It carried many a grown-up back in memory 
to the almost sacred precincts of those days and the 
schoolmates long loved and lost awhile. 
Then following these days come the grammar and 
high school days, when life becomes more realistic with 
its more serious problems both in school and social life. 
The boy and girl begins to realize the more serious side 
of life. He or she begins to make comparisons to dif- 
ferentiate and tighten the cords of companionship, and 
finally may find in these associations the one outstanding 
companion of life. 
Or he or she may go on to the weightier matters of 
college or university life, where relationships are marked 
by more serious problems. 
As there was a difference featuring grammar school  
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
and high school, differentiating them by change of asso- 
ciation and comradeship, so here in the university or col- 
lege life a change of atmosphere is found, marked by a 
broader outlook into life,—a new charm, much like that 
of the high-school association, yet different in that it pos- 
sesses sterner phases as one meets upon the broader field 
of activities. 
In intellectual contests one is matched with the select 
and keen minds of many high schools; in athletics with 
the picked, strong of muscle and fiber, and mental per- 
ception quickened to circumvent and parry strength. The 
social vision borders on awe as one sees the stars of the 
higher lights, the stately junior and reverend senior as 
they move in dramatics, social and conspicuous places. 
The verdant freshman wonders whether opportunity will 
be so kind to him as he peers into the coming years in 
vision. The new life of religious vision may here be 
awakened. Here also the fraternity life or social club 
or select student companionship will carve out as with 
a chisel the lines of character to mark him for future 
associations, whether for higher or more noble things of 
life, or for the common level of mediocrity. 
In these relations of intellectual culture athletic con- 
tests, social opportunity, and religious vision, we can see 
the goodness of God in thus charging the character of 
man with this passion for comradeship with all the de- 
sires and aspirations to measure up in life’s contests 
to excel or show one’s self worthy of the opportunity 
afforded. To fail or be noted as one unfit is a mark 
which either impels one on to higher and stronger effort 
or as a millstone may cause him to sink. 
Thus during the splendid associations of school and 
college life the young man or woman lays the ground- 
|
-P-A-G-E-97
  SOCIOLOGY 97 
work and foundation for his future activities. The last 
and closing stage scene is: 
The Commencement—the vestibule of real life without 
fuss and feathers. 
After grammar and high school life, and the sterner 
experiences of university life, we find the young man or 
woman entering upon the more austere relationships of 
commercial, industrial, political and religious activities, 
weaving in and out among men of various types, throw- 
ing out to his companions and associates the many in- 
fluences acquired in the former associations. In the com- 
mercial and industrial life the finer and nobler qualities 
are found mingled with the more sordid and selfish 
phases. He must here learn to discriminate between the 
square deal and the crooked path which are often pre- 
sented and placed before him for choice. One promising 
gain by short cut or compromise of principle, meaning 
gain with seared conscience and character lowered—the 
other a moderate promise of reward with hard work and 
probably longer path, yet the latter spells life with 
smaller wealth but with contentment. 
“T£ contentment, the parent of felicity and the faithful 
companion of hope, would whisper her consolations in 
our ears in vain might fortune wreck us on inhospitable 
shores.” 
Probably the finest expression of this sociological law 
of desire for companionship is manifest in the family re- 
lations above mentioned. 
Then come the close associations of comradeship and 
friendship seen in school life—following these phases we 
find the good-fellowhip of the church life marking a 
large factor in the lives of church-going people and mem- 
bers of the various religious bodies. In the activities of 
church-going people and religious life men are drawn
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
into very close friendship as they mingle in services de- 
signed for the consideration of God in His relations to 
man and Divine Providence manifested in His care and 
provision for mankind—accompanied with the altruistic 
motive which would grant and provide all such blessings 
for all mankind. 
/ This phase of sociology or social relations is probably 
‘\the outstanding hope of the world for the-elevation and 
perféction of man’s character. The inspiration gathered 
by these associations in church and altruistic gatherings 
growing out of same push the members of such out into 
the various avenues of life into the activities designed 
to uplift and provide for the betterment of mankind. 
The high and lowly here meet as brethren around one 
common table and make common cause for the advance- 
ment of righteousness—both as individuals and as an or- 
ganization to make known the privileges and benefits of 
the God-given spirit of righteousness among all nations, 
that all men may come into good-fellowship and promote 
the kingdom of peace and good-will among men. This 
wonderful good-fellowship to which all men with a de- 
sire for right living are invited is probably larger in its 
scope and far more reaching in its activities and vision 
than any other. : 
Into this fellowship and good-will men, women and 
children are invited and mingle in harmonious unison. 
It would embrace the world in its activities and reach to 
the ends of the earth in its efforts for the betterment of 
mankind as noted in the large and far-reaching mission- 
ary efforts marking the program of churches in recent 
years. Altruism, good-will, education, scientific investi- 
gations through the schools, with a desire to reach the 
highest solutions of life, mark the program of these 
organizations.
-P-A-G-E-99
SOCIOLOGY 99 
Then in the consideration of the altruistic association 
of men we would note the various Orders with ultimate 
object the same but varying in methods of functioning: 
The Masonic order with its many degrees and phases 
of membership ; the Odd Fellows and Knights of Pythias 
with their purpose of promoting kindliness and provision 
for the suffering; the Rotary Club and Elks, with a view 
of advancing good-will along social lines; the Common- 
wealth and Kiwanis Clubs, helping in lines of commer- 
cial and economic movement; the Y. M. C. A., Salvation 
Army, Knights of Columbus, and other sidelights of 
church life; labor unions, under the various heads such 
as the Federation of Labour, Locomotive Engineers, 
Builders’ trade unions, etc. All working for the better- 
ment of industrial or labour conditions. Also the many 
financial organizations to work out the intricate prob- 
lems of finance and economic law. All these, under some 
law or principle, look to the improvement of the rela- 
tions between men. “ The ways are many, the end it is 
one,” says Tupper. : 
As an illustration we might note the Father of Waters, 
the great Mississippi River. It begins its flow and rises 
in the small Lake Itasca and flows down towards the 
southland. It gains momentum and volume as it 
stretches out its course, cutting and deepening its chan- 
nels as it goes. Then it receives other streams from the 
mountains of the Appalachian chain and Alleghany 
mountains, bringing in the waters of the Alleghany and 
Monongahela forming the beautiful Ohio which receives 
the Tennessee, the Wabash and others, and mingles its 
flow with the great Mississippi. Then on the western 
side we see the great Missouri, the Arkansas, Black and 
Red rivers bringing in the waters from the great plains 
and Rocky Mountains; these all mingle in an harmonious   
   
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
whole as they continue their flow south and form the 
great Father of Waters. They are fed by springs, and 
floods of mountains and plains, and sing their songs of 
joy and good-fellowship as they mingle with their 
neighbours from afar. 
The praise of the beautiful states from which they 
came and their notes are heard as they send their cur- 
rents swiftly flowing over rock or cliff and through the 
. deepey levels of surging currents and whirlpool—then, 
‘as if‘forgetting the beautiful lays of homeland, they 
mingle ‘their joys with the waters of many climes, and 
sing another song of higher and loftier note as they surge 
into the channel of the great Mississippi, forgetting, as 
it were, the smaller differences as it rushes on toward 
the Gulf. 
They now speak not of their sources among the 
mountains and plains from whence they came, or of the 
states through which they flowed, but of a united nation, 
a stream which flows on to the larger and broader body 
of water and loses itself as it mingles with the great 
ocean which reaches to the shores of all lands and all 
peoples. 
So these great organizations, with the church, as they 
function and mingle their efforts in alleviating the suffer- 
ings of mankind, move on towards the goal of good-will 
and fellowship which will eventually embrace all man- 
kind. :

“And is mine one?” said Abou. “Nay not so,” 
Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low, 
But cheerly still and said, “I pray thee, then, 
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.” 
The angel wrote and vanished. The next night 
It came again, with a great awakening light, 
And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,

Athwart the boyish faces there, 
In sleep so pitiful and fair; 
I saw on Jamie’s rough, red cheek 
A tear undried. E’er John could speak, 
“He’s but a baby, too,” said I, 
And kissed him as we hurried. by. 
Pale, patient Robbie’s angel face 
Still in his sleep bore suffering’s trace. 
“No, for a thousand crowns, not him.” 
We whispered, while our eyes were dim, 
Poor Dick, bad Dick, our wayward son, 
Turbulent, reckless, idle one— 
Could be spared? Nay, He who gave 
Bids us befriend him to the grave. 
Only a mother’s heart can be 
Patient enough for such as he. 
“ And so,” said John, “I would not dare 
To send him from her bedside prayer.” 
Then stole we softly up above 
And knelt by Mary, child of love. 
“Perhaps for her ’twould better be,” 
I said to John. Quite silently 
He lifted up a curl astray 
Across her cheek in wilful way, 
And shook his head: “Nay, love; not thee,” 
The while my heart beat audibly. 
Only one more, our eldest lad, 
Trusty and truthful, good and glad— 
So like his father. “No, John, no— 
I cannot, will not, let him go.”

And so we wrote in courteous way, 
We could not give one child away; 
And afterward toil lighter seem’d, 
Thinking of that of which we dreamed, 
Happy in truth that not one face 
We missed from its accustomed place ; 
Thankful to work for all the seven, 
Trusting the rest to One in heaven.

CO-OPERATION 
fest among men we must consider the spirit of co- 
operation so prevalent in our government and among 
individuals, classes and nations—in political, religious, 
educational, domestic and industrial life. 
In the field of government men have grown and de- 
veloped from the individual or patriarchal and tribal 
forms of government to the highly organized form as we 
find them to-day in the outstanding national, state and 
municipal governments. 
We could trace the history of these developments but 
suffice to say that a surface survey would show how 
gradually the spirit of co-operation has worked through- 
out the world and brought man to his present state of 
fine altruistic motive. 
In the times of the patriarchs the father of the family 
was the controlling figure. Later the tribe, consisting of 
few or many families, combining, and electing a chief, 
either from outstanding bravery, ability to slay men or 
as hunter of animals—then followed the larger combina- 
tion of tribes and the welding of them into states; then 
the still larger combinations of states into empires and 
national governments, as we see them to-day in the 
British Empire and United States government. But 
along with this larger organization there have grown up 
within the national government the minor forms, but sub- 
ject to the national, the municipal and county forms, all 
104 I N all our discussion of the goodness of God as mani-
-P-A-G-E-105
  CO-OPERATION 105 
working together and co-operating with each other as 
wheels within wheels of machinery to work out the good 
of the whole. And along with these various forms we 
still maintain the patriarchal form to a limited extent as 
we find it in the family relations. These various forms 
of government have developed as men have learned to 
trust each other or to co-operate for protection, economic 
advantage or the higher ideals of altruistic purpose,— 
such as in educational and religious purpose. 
Not only have the peoples become highly organized 
along the above lines but the same spirit of co-operation 
is manifest as we study the ways and means by which 
men are led into a state of almost care-free and pleasur- 
able condition of society. 
Formerly during the tribal period the individual man 
was required to be prepared with his club or axe in hand 
to meet the attack of the enemy tribe—and during the 
reign of the feudal barons the walled castle was built to 
guard against the attack of the enemy, and the feudal 
lord was supposed to care for his subjects and they in 
turn to work at his direction. Then later a smaller num- 
ber, relatively, were required to serve as armed guards 
to insure their security while the rest could give attention 
to the higher lines of thought and development. 
So we have men co-operating in government to-day 
with a fine community and national spirit working out 
the highest and best for all. 
In our common currency system we have a fine medium 
of measure and exchange, common to all the people and 
so simple that the children can comprehend and employ 
same—for value received, as often quoted in our commer- 
cial activities, the deal is complete; while formerly it was 
a question of exchange values between states and large 
discounts for the weaker. Before the common medium 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
of monetary exchange came into vogue, leathers, hides, 
pieces of metals and other commodities were used as 
currency. 
Then came money values or stamped metals or paper 
form with the endorsement or guarantee giving confi- 
dence according to ability to pay—even up to the time of 
the civil war the moneys of the various states were valued 
upon the ability or security involved, until we have to- 
day an almost perfect system of currency based upon 
sound principles and enjoying the confidence of the world. 
All this has come through co-operation and the fine con- 
fidence manifested in our government. 
Again we have the common law for all, applied by 
judicial courts alike for all the people with comparative 
justice in the administration. The laws, the courts and 
administration of the laws are all the products of the 
people in common. Thus from the point of economy, 
liberty of action and promised justice the co-operative 
spirit as related to laws and their application both in 
civil and criminal procedure has advanced to a point of 
almost complete confidence. 
It is shown in our police system, the product of com- 
mon approval insuring society against the vicious and 
criminal classes, inspires confidence and allows men to 
devote their energies to the higher things instead of hav- 
ing them paralyzed by fear and insecurity. 
In our educational system we find the co-operative 
spirit working out most beautifully where all the people 
join by a common system of taxation to provide means 
for the education of all the children, rich and poor alike. 
In this phase of co-operation all are pointed to the 
highest ideals and may be found in equality before the 
law, society and educational advantage. 
It is shown in the use of our streets, our water systems,
-P-A-G-E-107
  
CO-OPERATION 107 
our health departments, our sanitary provisions, our hos- 
pitals to serve the poor and rich alike, our common Sab- 
bath or day of rest for all, holidays, etc. None of these 
fine provisions of society could be ours were it not for 
the spirit of co-operation so manifest by all. 
Then we may look further to the great railroad sys- 
tems, freight and passenger travel systems, provided by 
the spirit of co-operation as found in the associations of 
man‘and the financing of these great systems in order 
that all the people may enjoy these privileges. 
Men, women and children may travel around the world 
with almost perfect security on rails and steamships pro- 
vided by men they never saw or need to see upon the 
payment of a small profit on the original investment. 
We live in our house built by men we never saw or 
knew, build our fires with coal and wood furnished from 
mine and forest amid all the dangers of mining and mill- 
ing; and we eat our breakfast with knives, forks and 
spoons made thousands of miles away by men of foreign 
tongue or nativity. We dress ourselves, put on our shoes 
and walk upon our carpets made and furnished by men 
and women and children whose names and language we 
can scarcely guess. We read our newspapers every morn- 
ing furnished by men working throughout the night amid 
telegraph wires, type, machinery and the clicking of 
wheels and rolls, little thinking that we are enjoying 
privileges which were unknown to the kings of earth a 
few centuries ago. We send our children to school to 
teachers whose lives have been spent, many of them, ’mid 
the hardships of student life and self-abnegation. 
Our families ride upon the street cars or in automo- 
biles built thousands of miles distant and no questions 
asked if you can only pay the small fare—and upon elec- 
trical railroads whose power comes from the water falls

108 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
of the high Sierras or the rapidly flowing river many 
miles away. We attend churches whose preachers per- 
haps have striven amid humble surroundings to meet the 
requirement of present-day demands. 
Our hats and ornaments alike are provided by men 
whose lives are spent amid the cold winters of far north 
or in the hot and sunny climes of the southland. We pay 
the price and obtain the goods. 
Our electric system supplies the lights for house or 
power for machinery carried from far distant plants. We 
ask no questions as to how. 
The moving-picture may thrill our minds and the les- 
sons of the screen charm our vision, yet we may never 
consider the necessary co-operation and fine adjustments 
' required to produce the wonderful effect in the combina- 
tion employed. The theater itself is a marvel of beauty 
and architecture provided under this wonderful law of 
co-operation among men. 
So when we dwell upon these laws of co-operation, as 
they work out among men, and note the fine spirit of 
confidence manifested, we might wish that a modern 
Psalmist might write his findings and in an inspired 
vision paint in language understood by every human 
being, the wonderful manifestations of God’s goodness 
in instilling into the mind and soul of men this spirit of 
confidence and co-operation which is working out so 
beautifully for mankind into the better way and perfect 
day.

PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 
events as they come flowing into our lives, we are 
liable to think only of the more tangible things and 
neglect recognition of Divine Providence as manifest to 
those who regard more closely the happenings and events 
as they dovetail into one another. These providences are 
recognized by thoughtful men. Our purpose is-to show 
in a measure how these providential occurrences have 
served as pivotal points in history, changing both form 
and ideals of civilization. 
As we look about and note the wise provision in 
nature, with its many forms of life and the harmonious 
articulation of these forms, as they function in their 
evident purpose, we marvel. 
Tf we consult the horticulturist or botanist he will take 
up the microscope and point out the provision made with 
stamen, calix and corrola and pistle both for seed for 
propagation and food supply most marvelous. 
As we take a step higher and enter the field of 
Physiology, the physician will show you how wonder- 
fully nature has provided for all reasonable eventualities, 
covering the time of conception of life to the years when 
the child is expected to be self-sustaining, and even to 
old age. 
As we consider other fields of science and mark how 
nature has provided through the many laws of chem- 
istry, dynamics, astronomy and geology for the welfare 
110 I: our several spheres, busy amid the stream of
-P-A-G-E-111
  PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 111 
of man we can see, as pointed out by the many previous 
chapters, that without stint or limit the goodness of God 
is manifest. 
As we find in vegetable and all animal life this wise 
provision, may we not look for same as we peer into the 
relations of man in government and individual rela- 
tionship? 
As we turn back the pages of history and note the 
pivotal points of same may we not inquire whether 
Divine Providence has not figured very largely in turn- 
ing events to work out the swmmum bonum, or highest 
good, for the human race? 
In considering the Biblical story of the Tower of 
Babel, whether in the sense of allegory or facts of sacred 
history, we can see that such a conception as pictured— 
concentration of men to a point with the idea of reach- 
ing the unknown by means of physical powers and the 
destruction of said purpose—may be considered in accord 
with the Divine purpose to scatter men throughout the 
earth that they might inhabit and subdue it. 
We can also see the purpose of Divine Providence in 
the call of Abraham from Ur of the Chaldees to plant 
a nation at a point in the world’s great crossroads be- 
tween Europe, Asia and Africa, in the land of Palestine 
where the influence of the nation which alone recognized 
God as Jehovah and the only true Lord of Creation; and 
again in the fact that the Great Teacher of all the ages 
should be born here. 
Like the pollen of the flower and the fertilizing juices 
of animal life is the influence of this race upon the 
civilizations in their migrations woven into the life of 
humanity. 
Again we see a wise Providence in the distribution of 
the wealth of the world in order that man might be at-
-P-A-G-E-112
  112 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
tracted to it, either through necessity, love of adventure 
or desire to obtain the advantages which these objects of 
wealth would furnish. 
The special sources of wealth in all lands in many 
cases have remained undeveloped and hidden until such 
times as the special use of these was required by the 
necessities of man. The fertility of soil in large stretches 
of country, and the climatic conditions suitable to life 
and cultivation, have served to preserve the lives of the 
inhabitants in all lands when the lands have been culti- 
vated with reasonable care. But the populations of such 
lands are liable to become congested unless some impetus 
is given in the way of attraction to other lands. 
It may be the necessities growing out of the congestion 
or the new developments of civilization calling for the 
use of things to be found by migration and adventure 
into other parts of the world. Or it may be the suffer- 
ing incurred by racial or religious opposition causing 
such movement. 
Inventive genius, industrial and commercial necessity, 
or desire of knowledge, or gain, and even religious free- 
dom, have all served to cause such migrations and settle- 
ments of the various parts of the earth, all of which may 
be considered providential in a measure to provide for 
man’s sustenance and happiness. 
The new world was not discovered and inhabited 
until Columbus, with a conviction that the earth was 
round and desire to reach a shorter or easier route to 
the East Indies, and with the adventurous spirit devel- 
oped sufficiently, would take the chance. 
The spices of India may be the attraction, the fur 
skins of the far Arctics, the diamond mines of South 
Africa, the gold of California, or the hidden wealth of 
coals, oils and other minerals, as man’s need and call for
-P-A-G-E-113
  
PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 113 
them may demand migrations to secure them. Or it may 
be that the philanthropic motive or religious passion or 
scientific investigation, seeking knowledge may move him 
on toward the larger development and use of the world 
so wonderfully provided. 
In earlier times the necessities of fertile soils and well- 
watered lands, with food for family and stock, were the 
prime causes of migration. Then as trading and com- 
merce developed came the more intensive cultivation of 
lands for crops and goods for trading ; hence the develop- 
ment of the forest and mines. Then later came the in- 
dustrial period, with the discovery of steam and use of 
machinery, utilizing the ores of the mountains and mines, 
with coal and oils for fuel. Then the building of the 
larger vessels for ocean travel and trading between na- 
tions and continents, until to-day the world is well in- 
habited, the population well distributed and the world is 
one seething, pulsating, vibrating industrial and commer- 
cial whole. When the first telegraph system was com- 
pleted and the first message crossed the wires, it read, 
“What hath God wrought?” 
Tt was considered so wonderful, but now with the wire- 
less telegraph and telephone, the phonograph and moving 
picture, the industrial wonders of machinery, the auto- 
mobile and aeroplane, and with the healing process de- 
veloped in hygiene and surgery, and the end not yet, may 
we not again exclaim: “ What hath God wrought?” 
As we consider nations in these migrations of the races 
and the contacts involved, in their trading and commer- 
cial relations, as well as in their hostilities, we may note 
the fall of Rome. When it failed to function as a pro- 
gressive factor, apparently resting in its imagined secur- 
ity, and an earlier period pronounced by Catiline as “ de- 
generate, gross, defiled, the tainted haunt, the gorged

114 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
receptacle of every slave and vagabond of earth, a mighty 
grave that luxury has dug to rid the other realms of 
pestilence,” at a time when the great empire was no more 
worthy to guide the destinies of men, it was invaded by 
the great hordes from the north under Alaric with his 
barbarian armies which swept over the great cities, tak- 
ing the best and leaving much of the worst. 
But even here we see the finger of Providence, as 
Rome had built up a wonderful system of laws and the 
Latin language which became the heritage of these bar- 
barous tribes, and were spread among the invading peo- 
ples, as well as contributing to them much of the ac- 
quired culture of Rome. She was weighed in the bal- 
ance and was found wanting. 
So Egypt, Assyria, Carthage, Persia, all likewise fell. 
We can follow down through history and see how the 
various races and nations, as they have been invaded by 
foreign powers and even by less favoured nations, the 
invasions coming at a time when luxury and licentious- 
ness prevailed, have failed in the great purpose of life, 
and have been swept from power; yet contributing some 
outstanding cultural product of the nation’s genius. 
Rome contributed the Latin language, and many 
phases of law in use to-day. Greece likewise, with its 
elegant language and fine cultural development of art, as 
painting and sculpture, with its poets, orators, philoso- 
phers and great men of large vision as Homer, Demos- 
thenes, Aristotle, and others, all arriving at a high de- 
gree of culture and mental power, lapsed back into 
mediocrity. 
Spain, once the mistress of the world, likewise passed 
up the sceptre after her wonderful functioning in her 
new world discoveries. 
Likewise other nations, as Russia, Germany and Aus-
-P-A-G-E-115
See ae eee 
PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 115 
tria, all having played their part in military, industrial 
and commercial activities, have fallen back in the strug- 
gle among the world powers. 
The question now may be apropos: Will the now 
outstanding nations of the allied powers be able to hold 
their positions of prominence, or will they fall as the 
others in their failure to measure up to the higher re- 
quirements of Divine Providence? 
As nations and powers have fallen after having func- 
tioned in a large way to advance civilization, so men 
have risen and fallen as they failed to vision and grasp 
the higher purposes of life’s great movements and re- oc 
sponsibilities. 
And again it would appear that, when the world 
emergencies arise, requiring men and women of large 
vision and calibre, such leaders are produced by the 
crises involved as Moses, Esther, Charlemagne, Jeanne 
d’Arc, Washington, Lincoln, Haig, and Pershing, all 
apparently meeting the exigencies of the crisis, and all 
outstanding as righteous characters. 
In the migrations of peoples from the various causes 
into the uttermost parts of the earth, and the mingling 
of the races in their search for wealth, desire for com- 
fort and educational advancement, we can trace the hand 
of Providence in thus throwing together men into these 
farthest parts, causing them to mingle in all these rela- 
tions in trading, in commercial, industrial, social, educa- 
tional and political life in order that the spirit of courtesy 
and good-will might be developed. The Great Teacher 
on a certain occasion said: “ Where two or three are met 
together in my name (loving-kindness) there am I in the 
midst.” 
The spirit of courtesy and kindness can best be de- 
veloped where men meet in the spirit of good-will on
-P-A-G-E-116
  
  116 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
the street, in the counting house, in the factory or mine, 
in the commercial and industrial world, in the church and 
social congregations, in political and economic assem- 
blies, and in the fine family relations prevailing among 
men. : 
As we watch the crowds in the street as they weave 
in and out along the banquet or in automobile, and in 
the great congregations of people as they meet together 
for the various purposes of life, we marvel at the -or- 
derly and courteous movements of all, and can note the 
genial spirit and the happy expression attending their 
general demeanor. When we compare this happy condi- 
tion with the tribal wars and warfare which prevailed 
in the earlier periods of history, and consider the vast 
populations of the modern world, we can see that there 
are comparatively few people engaged in hostilities to-day 
compared with the proportion formerly so engaged. 
And even during the great World War the mingling 
of soldiers from the antipodes and farthest reaches of 
the earth in their military relationships and fellowships 
was conducive of a friendship and cordiality probably 
never so far-reaching for good in the history of the 
. world. The enlightenment along social, industrial lines 
and lines of higher ideals and aspirations, was probably 
more broadly and keenly advanced than during any other 
campaign in history. Men may make war and try to 
destroy, but their works and deeds can never circum- 
vent and annul the great purpose of the Creator in 
eventually producing a race worthy of His care and 
preservation, whose lives will respond to the call and 
challenge. All.things work together for good to those 
who respond according to His purpose. “The stones 
would cry out if necessary.” 
The organizations for the accomplishment of this
-P-A-G-E-117
PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 117 
great program are evidently in existence to-day; and as 
kindness and good-will are the greatest assets in busi- 
ness, also in the social and industrial world, why should 
we not emphasize courtesy and kindness in our teach- 
ings to children in the schools as well as in the churches, 
lodges and social organizations and family relation- 
ships? 
We must not fail here, but rather emphasize courtesy 
and kindness and score at this point. 
One of the outstanding expressions and marks of a 
lady or gentleman is courtesy and kindness. 
PROVIDENCE 
We may try to dam the stream and halt the flow of 
the evils of war by scrapping battle-ships ; but the stream 
will remain muddy and the waters foul unless we de- 
mand systematic teaching for the children of the world 
of the principles of courtesy, kindness and good-will, 
which are the higher ideals of Americanism. These alone 
can stay the evils of war in the future. 
The formula was given nearly two thousand years ago: 
Good-will and péace—the alternative is hate and war. 
_ These two formulae are axiomatic in their operations 
and their conclusions are inexorable. : 
Why not send 100,000 American school teachers 
throughout the world by using the money saved by scrap- 
ping the battle-ships for ten years? 
Or it may be that the nations now owing America 
large debts could pay a portion of the interest in defray- 
ing the expenses of such teachers in foreign countries. 
It would pay every nation one hundred fold to engage 
and defray the expenses of such teachers for ten years. 
And it would pay the United States to allow much of 
the interest on the national debts to go towards paying
-P-A-G-E-118
  118 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
the expenses of said teachers in inculcating these highest 
principles of life in all the children throughout the world, 
the central powers included. 
While we are trying to destroy war, why not do the 
work thoroughly? We have object-lessons along this 
line in the Philippines, so it will not be an experiment. 
The writer believes that every nation would welcome 
such teachers from America; lecturers, sports and 
movies illustrating these ideals would be apropos. 
In case this spirit of courtesy and good-will could per- 
meate mankind as it should, the present generation of 
men might measure up to the requirements, whereby the 
purposes of Divine Providence could be fully accom- 
plished. 
We chide and decry those who, for sport or greed, 
cause the cocks to fight in the cock-pit, and the habitués 
of the bull-ring for this sport and cruel propensities, 
satisfied by the bull-fight, while we, for pique or greed, 
will cause our children to slay each other and because 
their elders lack the mentality to prevent the cruelties 
of war. 
The time has come to stop and cease such cruel triflings 
and give ourselves to the higher and better arts of peace. 
The old formula in a new triangle may function in: 
Courtesy, Kindness, and Good-will. 
In the beautiful but sad picture as seen in the paint- 
ing “ The End of the Trail,” there is not only the con- 
cept of the feeling, condition and spirit of the man and 
beast at the end of the trail, but there is a picture of a 
race and people who have contravened by life and action 
the purposes of the Creator and have failed to co-operate 
with Him in His great plan. There is the collapse, as 
it were, after the long journey and years during which
-P-A-G-E-119
  PROVIDENCES OF LIFE 119 
they failed to arrive. “The journey is done—the race 
is gone.” 
It may be described in the language of one who 
painted a word-picture of the American Indian. He 
says: “As a race, they have withered from the land. 
Their arrows are broken, their springs are dried up, and 
their cabins are in the dust. Their council fires have 
long since gone out on the shores, and their war cry is 
fast dying away to the untrodden west. Slowly and 
sadly they climb the distant mountains and read their 
doom in the setting sun. They are shrinking before the 
mighty tide which is fast pressing them away. They 
shall soom hear the roar of the last wave which shall set- 
tle over them forever. Ages hence the inquisitive white 
man, as he stands by some growing city, shall ponder over 
the structure of their disturbed remains and wonder to 
what manner of people they belong. They shall live only 
in the songs and chronicles of their exterminators. May 
these be faithful to their rude virtue as men, and pay due 
tribute to their unhappy fate as a people.” 
In 1865, when word reached New York City that Lin- 
coli had been shot, crowds gathered in the streets and 
soon excited masses of men were surging up and down 
the avenues. Nobody could say what would come next. 
Young General Garfield, afterwards president, was in the 
city, and was requested to speak to the people. He stood 
on the veranda of his hotel and in his efforts to allay the 
excitement he uttered these words, “God reigns and the 
government at Washington still lives.’ As those words 
echoed through the throngs, the people became quiet and 
soon began to disperse. They went to their homes feel- 
ing that, even under the stress and.strains of govern- 
ments, a sympathetic ‘hand rules and guides the ship of 
state, and that men can trust the eternal, benign purpose.

the movements of man and the adaptation of 
the Creator’s laws to man’s need, we shall now 
take up for observation the benign purpose served in the 
Stability of Law. 
In the study of astronomy and the laws of force oper- 
ating among celestial spheres, we note the exactness and 
precision with which these bodies function under the laws 
of gravitation, centripetal and centrifugal forces. In all 
these movements of the heavenly bodies we see perma- 
nency and stability challenging our admiration and we 
wonder as we observe the mathematician and astronomer 
calculating with practically absolute precision and exact- 
ness the seasons, times, orbits, ecliptics, and the revolv- 
ing motions of the farthest star, sun or system. 
Well has the Biblical writer said: “In Him there is 
no variableness nor shadow of turning; but He is the 
same to-day, yesterday and forever.” 
We feel so absolutely sure of the stability of the laws 
governing the solar system that we never imagine what 
would happen should the sun fail to rise on the morrow, 
or the light and heat should fail for an instant. 
In geology we see the same laws operating as in the 
solar system and astronomical world. Gravitation holds 
the materials of the earth, the outer crust and inner for- 
mations in firm relations, and securely binds them in their 
spheres to function in the benign purpose of sustaining 
121 H = considered many of the laws governing
-P-A-G-E-122
  
122 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
life. The outer crust and cooler surface is adapted and 
suited for the habitation of man while the inner parts 
are found, as we bore into the depths of the earth, to be 
of a warmer character uncongenial to life, but serving 
the purpose for support of the outer crust and probably 
furnishing the necessary supplementary heat to sustain 
life on the earth. 
Humanity has attained to such confidence in the stabil- 
ity of these God-given laws that no question is asked 
as to their stability and permanency. 
The Stability of Law as related to vegetation, heredity 
of animal life and all those laws relating to the propaga- 
tion of life, is seen in all nature. The Biblical statement 
of this fact cannot be improved upon: “ Let the earth 
bring forth living creatures after his kind.” This fol- 
lows with a persistency most marvelous. It is said that 
a grain of corn, after passing through an animal and run- 
ning the gauntlet of all the adverse conditions of such 
ordeal, remaining whole, will germinate and produce as 
well as another untried in the furnace of such test. 
In the animal creation we see the permanency of laws 
manifested in the laws of heredity ; the monkey will pro- 
duce monkey and not man. 
But the law of intervention is also persistent, other 
influences coming in may produce another kind of mon- 
key. The horse, with all persistence, without intervening 
influences, will produce a horse, but certain other influ- 
ences may cause another kind of horse to be produced. 
Jacob’s law of intervention, such as stripped or barked 
trees, according to Biblical account may so influence the 
strain of cattle or flock as to mark them with stripes. 
Also the various strains and crosses of animals speak of 
the persistent law of influence operating among animal 
creation.
-P-A-G-E-123
  STABILITY OF LAW. 123 
But like, uninfluenced, may be expected to produce 
like. 
The law of permanency may be seen in the operation 
of farm and factory. 
The farmer may reasonably expect to reap a crop when 
he plants the seed and like unto the seed planted. It 
does not evaporate. 
The builder of house, factory, railroad or mill may 
reasonably expect to have the use of them as they do not 
decay immediately. 
In other words the Biblical statement is apropos: “ God 
is not mocked, whatsoever a man soweth that shall he 
also reap.” 
In the laws of chemistry, mathematics, electricity and 
dynamics this law of stability maintains throughout. As 
illustration, we can see in the science of mathematics how 
the finely adjusted laws of numbers are contributing to 
the welfare of man. As we study the vast systems of 
the solar world their almost incalculable distances, their 
movements in relation to one another, and their adapta- 
tions to our needs of life, we find the laws of numbers 
outstanding—and closely interwoven with the function- 
ing of these bodies in their relations and influences upon 
one another; yet we never pause to ask: Are they relia- 
ble as helps in understanding these vast creations? 
Mathematics is called an exact science: “Figures do 
not lie” is a trite saying. By the law of numbers we 
estimate the time and length of the various seasons, their 
relation to the various periods of the year, and the ever 
recurring night and day. In fact, without these marks 
of events, we would not have any calculation of time, for 
time is that which marks the succession of events. This 
conception of time affords us a distinction between time
-P-A-G-E-124
ee ere ee ee 
nrg 124 THE SOCIOLOGICAL Le 
and eternity. We calculate time by t 
Eternity cannot be calculated. 
One great astronomer, commenting on the wonderful 
conjunction of Mars and Jupiter on November 27th, 
1921, says: “The conjunction occurred exactly on time 
as predicted four years before. But think what the 
mathematicians had to know absolutely to predict this 
conjunction. The planets are all moving on ellipses, not 
circles, and each perturbs all the others and changing 
velocities and directions. All complex equations were 
solved and the conjunction came on time. These works 
make those who solved the problems transcendent.” 
These wonderful calculations can be made by man only 
as he is enabled to use the God-given laws found in the 
realm of mathematics and provided in the Stability of 
Law. i 
As we study the history of numbers and their relation 
to the welfare of man, we find that, Roneiteren with his- 
tory, runs this science of exact calculations. The early 
Egyptian astrologers, as well as those of Assyrian and 
Chinese origin, were learned in the use of numbers and 
made use of them in their calculations marking the move- 
ments of the heavenly bodies. The Egyptians evidently 
used these laws in the building of the pyramids and in 
every important work requiring exactness. Numbers 
were necessary to build with precision. In the earliest 
Hebrew history numbers were used as all the writings 
would indicate. In fact with the dawn of history man 
resorted to numbers in marking transitions, years and 
times. 
In chemistry and physics, in calculations and prepara-~ 
tions of formulae indicating proportions, and combina- 
tions made in the movements and transitions of changing ne use of numbers:
-P-A-G-E-125
STABILITY OF LAW. 125 
substance, this exact science of numbers is outstanding 
as a necessary handmaid to these sciences. 
In industrial, commercial, social and political life, the 
feature of permanency is calculated to insure peace and 
comfort and always inspires confidence and assurance to 
all parties concerned. 
All of our improvements in nation, state, city or indi- 
vidual capacity, permanency is the foundation of confi- 
dence. Our railroads, great transportation systems, sub- 
ways and tunnels, building projects, constitutions and 
laws, all speak of and stand upon the Stability of Law. 
Any fantastic or effervescent or unstable or shifting for- 
mula or plan is inconsistent with the highest purposes 
of God and man. 
~ The Great Teacher on a certain occasion called atten- 
tion to mark the distinction between the stable and un- 
stable in his parable of the house built upon the rock. 
The wise man builds for eternity upon the rock, the 
stable foundation for permanency. 
The Stability of Law as related to God always inspires 
men to the highest effort and accomplishment and an 
optimism unfailing. But the fearful and doubtful man 
is likened unto the waves of the sea ever changing and 
unsettled. — 
The desire for Stability in Law appears to be inherent 
in man, and faith in the permanency of law is the foun- 
dation of all movements and action looking to the im- 
provement of humanity. “According to your faith it 
shall be.” If we had no faith in the laws controlling the 
solar system, the laws of heredity, the laws of animal and 
vegetable life and in our friends and family, the path of 
life would certainly be a rough one, full of doubt and 
fear. In fact, faith in the stability of these God-given 
laws is necessary to our existence, propagation and 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  
    | 126 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
friendships. All family relations and all social, indus- 
trial and commercial relations must bear the mark of con- 
fidence in the Stability of Law. So, in all our observa- 
tions for the goodness of God, we see outstanding this 
law of permanency upon which we build our lives and 
character; and, as this confidence grows by experience 
and observation and we study the goodness of God in all 
creation, we will find, as the Hebrew writer remarks in 
the 107th Psalm, last verse: 
“Whoso is wise he will observe these things, and he 
shall know of the loving-kindness of God.” 
The furniture of the earth and of the heavens may 
change from style to style, but the fundamental proper- 
ties of its constituents remain, as Thomson says, and 
quotes from Sir Clerk Maxwell, “ Though in the course 
of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur 
in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved 
and new systems evolved out of the ruins the molecules, 
the foundation stones of the universe, remain unbroken, 
and unworn. They continue this day as they were cre- 
ated—perfect in number and measure and weight.” We 
see then that man can make or change the form of com- 
bination, but he cannot create. 
The persistency and stability of law is manifest in the 
wonderful economy of nature or law of conservation of 
energy. That energy which disappears in one form re- 
appears in another form has been found to be universally 
true. As wood or coal burns we find the results in light 
and heat. We may change water into the gases hydro- 
gen and oxygen, and from these gases we may obtain 
energy for moving machinery, and the products of the 
manufacturing process may again be changed into some 
form of energy, say electricity, which may be stored and 
used for moving trains or ringing a door-bell.  
-P-A-G-E-127
  STABILITY OF LAW 127 
Scientists tell us that energy is indispensable to life, 
and that as it is humanly impossible to destroy a particle 
of matter so it is impossible to destroy energy. So we 
can be positively sure, in all ‘our calculations from proven 
formulae, that the changing forms of matter will result 
in some form of energy, and likewise the energy may be 
changed into matter of various shapes and forms. In 
other words, matter and energy are interchangeable and 
yet indestructible. These facts and processes are won- 
derful blessings to mankind. In fact life could not con- 
tinue without matter and energy and their processes of 
change. The food which one eats must be changed into 
energy by the processes of digestion and assimilation; 
and the resultant energy may take many forms of action 
at the volition of the king in the palace.

1. Stability of law is manifest in the movement of the heavenly 
bodies. It challenges our admiration and gives confidence in all 
calculations. 
2. In geology, through the laws of gravitation, we see. stability 
and permanence most marvelous. 
3. Vegetable life, like producing like; but influenced by inter- 
ference. / 
4. Laws of heredity, family associations and friendships. 
5. Mathematical calculations and laws of the solar system speak

6. The findings of chemistry and physics ‘as well as in prac- 
tically all the sciences stability must mark progress and the gen- 
eral features of calculations. 
7. The farmer and business man needs stability to insure suc- 
cess. “Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.” 
Labor must have promise of reaping.

THE HIGHER IDEALS 
H AVING treated the question of Co-operation as it   
works out among men we must look further and 
consider the Ideals of men. 
The spirit of co-operation inspired by the Higher 
Ideals stands out so prominently and works out so beauti- 
fully that we feel impelled to note other great purposes 
served by these Ideals which have contributed so much 
good to mankind. 
As we look through the pages of history and note the 
progress of man as he has advanced from one stage of 
civilization to higher stages, we see that only as he has 
been impelled by the more worthy motives and ideals in 
his activities has the progress been marked for good. The 
Higher Ideals inspiring the motives and lives of men 
draw them into those activities which spell for advance- 
ment in civilization. As one civilization is built upon the 
one preceding and our lines have fallen to us in pleasant 
places we must look into the ideals which impelled our 
ancestors to action. Many mistakes have been made, 
but as one of our country’s famous men said: “The man 
who does things makes some mistakes but the man who 
does nothing makes no mistakes.” 
The ideals set forth in the Declaration of Independence 
give us a clue to the visions of life and purpose of the 
founders of our Republic. Divine providence and altru- 
istic purpose are mentioned in the first paragraph of the 
Declaration—the conception of democracy as purposed 
128
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE HIGHER IDEALS 129 
sets a new standard of values upon life and property as 
well as upon the relations of men—men are declared to 
be born free and equal. With recognition of Divine 
Providence and with the ideals of justice the people of 
the democracy pledged their lives each to other to carry 
out the purposes of the declaration. So we see implanted 
in the first concept of our government the seeds of 
responsibility to God and the altruistic purpose of service 
to men. 
These ideals have prompted and served our fathers in 
many of their following declarations. And as these ideals 
have been wrought out in law and authority our nation 
has made advance and won the admiration of all nations. 
One ideal, and probably the most notable, was that set 
forth by our first President, George Washington, when 
he took the oath of office and placed his hand upon 
Micah, 6th chapter and 8th verse: “ What doth the Lord 
require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy and 
to walk humbly with thy God.” 
The same ideals were approved and set forth when our 
President Warren G. Harding took the oath of office and 
placed his hand upon the same passage of Scripture. 
Abraham Lincoln in his second inaugural address voices 
the same sentiment when he made the declaration and 
uttered those memorable words: “With malice towards 
none and charity for all, with firmness in the right as God 
gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the 
work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds,” etc. 
Also in his last public address he said: “He from whom 
all blessings flow must not be forgotten. A call for a 
national thanksgiving is being prepared.” 
These ideals and purposes actuating our fathers sid 
their children have helped to form the fiber of the Amer- 
ican character which finds expression in the laws of our
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
democracy which in turn contribute to our welfare as 
a nation and as individuals. 
As we review the lives of men and nations, we see 
ideals crystallized and focussed at some point or combina- 
tion of events in their lives. When Lincoln, as a young 
man, saw a little slave girl auctioned off on the auction 
block in New Orleans he remarked, “If I ever get a 
chance to hit that thing I will hit it hard.” And he did. 
Far back in Roman history we see Catiline as he ap- 
peals to his people and the patrician class pointing out the 
follies, crime and lewdness of that great city, saying: 
“Rome is no more like Rome than the foul dungeon is 
like the glorious sky ; what is she now, degenerate, gross, 
defiled, the tainted haunt, the gorged receptacle of every 
slave and vagabond of the earth, a mighty grave which 
luxury has dug to rid the other realms of pestilence.” 
What scathing rebuke cast at the same city by the 
great apostle, Paul, in his letter to the Romans; listen: 
“ Being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covet- 
ousness, maliciousness, full of envy, murders, debate, 
strife, deceit, malignity, whisperers, backbiters, haters of 
God. Without understanding, implacable, covenant 
breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful.” This 
scathing denunciation pointed out the opposite and higher 
ideals to be followed at a time when civilization was tot- 
tering to its fall. It was a warning to men and nations 
of all times to seek the higher ideals of life, and has 
pointed men to higher visions of life. These signals 
along the road were evidently given as warnings of dan- 
ger of the precipice or rapids below. And all through 
the ages, lights have burst forth and the torch of life 
has been held aloft by men who sensed the danger and 
held forth the higher ideals as a beacon light. 
Centuries later the higher ideals of civilization were
-P-A-G-E-131
THE HIGHER IDEALS 131 
held aloft by such men as Edmund Burke, Fox, Pitt and 
Wilberforce. Listen to Burke as he denounced the 
tyranny of his country in trying to force the American 
Colonies into submission, as he stands in the Parliament 
before his countrymen: “Since I had the honour, I 
should say the dishonour, of sitting in this house, I have 
been witness to many strange, many infamous transac- 
tions ; what can be your intention in attacking all honour 
and virtue? Do you mean to drag all men to a level 
with yourselves and extirpate all honour and inde- 
pendence? Perhaps you imagine a vote will settle the 
whole controversy. Alas, you are not aware that the 
manner in which your vote was procured is a secret to 
no man. Listen, for if you are not totally callous, if 
your consciences are not seared, I will speak daggers to 
your souls and wake to all the hell of guilty recollection, 
T’ll follow you with whips and strings through every 
maze of your unexampled turpitude and plant thorns 
under the rose of ministerial approbation. You have 
flagrantly violated justice and laws of the land, and 
opened a door for anarchy and confusion. After assum- 
ing an arbitrary dominion over law and justice, you 
issue orders, warrants and proclamations against every 
opponent and send as prisoners to your ‘ Bastille’ all 
those who have the courage and virtue to defend the 
honour of their country. It is in vain that you hope by 
fear and terror to extinguish the native British fires; the 
more sacrifices, the more martyrs you make, the more 
numerous the sons of liberty will become. They will 
multiply like the hydra and hurl vengeance upon your 
heads. That I may not be a witness to these monstrous 
proceedings I shall leave the house, and I doubt not but 
that every honest man, every independent man, every 
friend to England will follow me. These walls are un-
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
holy, baleful, deadly, as long as a prostitute majority 
holds the bolt of parliamentary power and hurl their 
vengeance only upon the virtuous. To yourself, there- 
fore, I consign you. Enjoy your pandemonium.” 
The same spirit of defy was marked in the great 
speech of Patrick Henry when, at a time that tried men’s 
souls, he exclaimed: “Give me liberty or give me 
death.” 
Other great men throughout the ages have set high 
standards by word and deed. These great ideals held 
aloft by men of firm convictions and holy purpose at 
times when tyrants flourished and states seethed in cor- 
ruption, have held civilization in its upward path of 
progress as the pilot may be guided by the stars of light. 
These, holding the torch high, have led the way for us. 
As ideals apply in political relationships, so they may 
be observed in all social, industrial and commercial rela- 
tions and aspirations. We may note the plans of co- 
operation in the various schemes of industrial life and 
social service organizations, in the Red Cross, Associated 
Charities, etc. | 
Be fair to the children, the boys and girls of to-day, 
upon whom the future of our country and the world 
depend. Give them the right perspective of life, the 
higher ideals of Americanism to guide them in all rela- 
tionships. Otherwise the road will be difficult and the 
path unsafe, for their responsibilities will be greater and 
the keenness of vision more necessary as the light is lift- 
ing the veil of darkness throughout the world, The man 
” with the ox-cart and surry with old dobbin, tugging at 
traces, was safe on the rough country roads of one hun- 
dred years ago, but upon the modern highway, amid 
speeding machines, he has no place. 
In years past, men with feet unsteady and mind cloudy
-P-A-G-E-133
THE HIGHER IDEALS 133 
and misty from alcohol, could manage in some way to 
get along, but to-day such men have become passe and 
their places are taken by men of clear vision and steady 
hand. They have no more place in the economy of 
God’s plans for His universe. Even the fool can see the 
folly of such a life in this age. 
In commercial life formerly men could be endured 
with mind thus clouded, but to-day the merchant passing 
life in this way is a back number, only waiting for the 
obsequies. It is an electrical age, requiring quick action 
of body, mind and character, as we may differentiate 
character as a combination of mind and spirit which give 
expression to life. 
As in commercial, so in industrial life there is very 
little place for the man in responsible positions who does 
not sense the needs of the times. In handling the ex- 
pensive, delicate and intricate machinery of mill or fac- 
tory the whole man with body and nerve steady,’ mind 
clear and purpose sure, must be there to-day. Under the - 
liability and compensation laws the man of unsteady 
habits of mind or body is not a good risk and cannot be : 
placed in positions of responsibility. Business and pro- 
fessional men everywhere are looking for clean men of 
high ideals and character to fill these places. 
The marks of character are outstanding in the habits 
of life. The cigarette habit, profanity, disrespect for 
womanhood, speaking lightly of the higher things of life, 
and the propensity to looseness in speech and slouchy 
habits, lack of consideration for others, all these mark 
the character to be shunned—in the hope of helping to . 
the higher standards of life as seen in cleanness, cour- 
tesy, kindness and good-will. 
These are the greatest assets in business and social 
life, as well as in domestic and political life. They can-

134 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
not be measured by mathematical calculation. These 
values can only be estimated as they find a place in the 
economy of God’s purpose, and as these higher ideals 
fit into His great plan in working the highest good for 
humanity. 
When one aspires for The Higher Ideals he can find 
a means of cultivation through his associations and en- 
vironment. We grow into the likeness of the character 
we admire and we may seek in our friendships the char- 
acters which inspire us to higher ideals. 
“Hitch your wagon to a star” is a kind suggestion 
which would stimulate us in our aspirations and lead us 
to mingle in life’s purpose with those who are holding 
the torch a little higher. These companionships may be 
found in the character of the books we read and the 
ideals approved by their author. 
The attitude which we assume to life, whether that of 
optimism which brushes away the fog, or that of pessi- 
mism which clouds the path, always reflects itself in char- 
acter and action. The good men who inspire us and 
those who have tried life in its various phases may write 
a proverb or enclose in a word motto a truth and thought 
to warn or inspire us, as their life findings may suggest. 
In these laws of association and environment we can 
see the wise provision made by our Great Creator for 
character building, as men may aspire to the Higher 
Ideals. ;

TIME AND PLACE 
we must observe time and place as well worthy of 
consideration. Some one has said that time cannot 
be defined, and, like electricity, can only be described as 
it figures in the life of man, as we may say this or that 
shows the marks of time. 
So time may be considered as that which marks the 
succession of events. Place may be featured as that 
which may be differentiated from every other place in 
the universe. 
As time is swallowed up in eternity, so place is swal- 
lowed up in space, or as a very learned university Doc- 
tor would say: “In the unfathomable universe.” 
So we may consider time as an integral part of eter- 
nity for use by man to measure the succession of events. 
By time we mark the points in history as before or after 
certain other time or event. We mark the beginning of 
history as 4004 years B. C., and succeeding events as 
following at a certain point of time thereafter, or as re- 
lated to another point of time called A. D, This point 
of time is so commonly mentioned upon our stationery, 
in our commercial, industrial, educational and political 
documents that we scarcely stop to consider its meaning. 
In considering the periods of time as related to the 
great creations of the universe, we speak in epochs of 
time rather than in years, or as the age marked by the 
various strata and fossils of the earth, but “in the be- 
137 L our study of the Creator’s wise provision for man 
 
-P-A-G-E-138

138 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
ginning” may mean the beginning of all time, inclusive 
of the epochs or ages of creation. But when man began 
to function as a creature marked by God’s care and con- 
sideration as given in Biblical chronology, we take up 
the events as marked in time by years; and the point in 
space at which man began to function at a certain time 
at a certain place. 
So our histories are the record of events as they 
transpired at a given time at a certain place. As the 
outstanding events and pivotal points in history have 
been marked by crises, we find that many of these are 
marked by wars at a certain time at a certain place. 
These points, as they are brought to our attention and 
are placed in memory’s halls, either to encourage us to 
higher effort with higher ideals, pushing us forward with 
nobler and altruistic purpose, or they may cause us to 
lapse back into pessimism as they pass in review before 
our mental vision. | 
The great events of history marked by chivalry, cour- 
age and high ideals appear to enthuse us with a passion 
for like courage and endurance. As when the world’s 
civilization was at stake, Charlemagne rolled back the 
Moors at the Pyrenees, and Charles Martel forced back 
the Saracens (732 B. C.) and at Tours, thus saving 
Europe for modern civilization. Or as we see Britain’s 
unflinching courage and skill marked by the naval vic- 
tory at Trafalgar by Lord Nelson. These fill us with 
higher and nobler aspirations; they also lend to our 
memories facts of experience and observation from 
which we plan our future course. 
As we place the searchlight of memory upon the 
pivotal points in European history and mark how civiliza- 
tion, caught at times between the pincers of hostile forces 
and about to be plunged into an abyss of utter dark-
-P-A-G-E-139
  
TIME AND PLACE 139 
ness, we marvel at the timely deliverance when men 
fought with back against the wall and prayed. 
The Frenchmen will always remember the great bat- 
tles of the late World War and tell their children of 
their great deliverance at the battles of the Marne, at 
Chateau-Thierry, at Belleau Wood, at the Argonne, and 
the timely coming of Uncle Sam’s forces from overseas. 
How the children and grandchildren of Britain’s fold 
will delight to hear of the valour and chivalry of the 
British and Canadian forces at Ypres and other fields at 
other times and places. Likewise, the Italian fireside 
will echo with the stories of bravery of General Diaz 
and his army at the River Piave. The children of 
Jewish parentage will always delight to hear of the de- 
liverance of the Hebrew people from the Egyptians, and 
the crossing of the Red Sea; about David and his single- 
handed victory over the great Goliath; of Queen Esther 
in her wonderful fortitude, saving the race and nation 
at a certain time and place. 
And, as we approach American history, our children 
will always delight to hear of the bravery and chivalry 
of their ancestors as we tell of Bunker Hill, Lexington, 
Yorktown, Washington crossing the Delaware, and the 
winter at Valley Forge, and as we come on down and 
note the great battles of the Civil War, the battle above 
the clouds on the Lookout Mountain, and the battle of 
Gettysburg and peace at Appomattox. Also as during 
the Spanish-American War, the wonderful morning 
when Dewey with his brave men and small fleet steamed 
into Manila Bay and placed the Philippines under the 
aegis of the American flag. 
Although the past has been replete with the wars and 
battles marking time and place, yet we can read be- 
tween the lines the great altruistic motive actuating many   
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
warriors in their loyalty to the higher ideals and desire 
for world peace. While the historian has placed special 
emphasis on these outstanding crises in the affairs of 
men in the past, yet we can see, as we peer into the 
kaleidoscopic movements of the race, many great accom- 
plishments along the lines of peace which is now appeal- 
ing to the nations. 
Through the outstanding arts of peace which have 
pushed the world forward to better things, we note the 
great inventions of the ages. Guttenberg, Watt, Edison, 
Wright Brothers, and the many other men of genius in 
the industrial lines have brought out the power of let- 
ters, steam, electricity, and along the lines of chemical 
combinations, so that war must hereafter be crowded out 
of man’s formula for the great combination necessary 
for the world’s advancement. War has become such a 
waste in the economy of man’s relationships, and has at 
last become so distasteful and so expensive in life and 
property, that other means must necessarily be found 
for settlement of all differences between nations as be- 
tween individuals. 
Although we have lauded men in their great accom- 
plishments in wars of the past, and give all honour to 
those heroes to-day, may we not hope that as much 
praise shall be in store for those who are so persistently 
working out formulae for prevention of wars? The 
pivotal points in the histories of the future will probably 
be marked by the peace conferences, the great and higher 
ideals held up to the children of the world, the advances 
in education and altruistic motives which are now actu- 
ating man to the highest and noblest in life. The men 
of valour will be marked by their contributions to the 
arts of peace. May it be the boast of all men that their 
heroes of peace, courtesy, and good-will hold a place in
-P-A-G-E-141
  TIME AND PLACE ‘141 
their memory not below that of the warriors of the past, 
but filling a niche in the temple of fame, equal to and 
alongside of the highest and noblest. May it be the 
boast that these men and women were born here, at such 
a time and in this place. 
As it may be pointed out in our chapter on Higher 
Ideals, we can see that these men with the environment, 
education and association leading up to such lives, en- 
rich our civilization. They are marked characters to 
be emulated by our people in the crises of life. They 
must be given a place in history marked by time and 
place, as contributing to the well-being of mankind. 
We cannot know the material world except through 
our conceptions and knowledge of the relations of ob- 
jects in time and place. 
As Dr. Betts says: “The material world which we 
enter through the gateway of the senses is more marvel- 
ous than any fairy world created by the fancy of story 
tellers for it contains the elements of all they have con- 
ceived and much more besides. It is more marvelous 
than any structure planned and executed by the mind 
of man, for all the wonders and beauties of the Coliseum 
or St. Peter’s existed in nature before they were discov- 
ered by the architect, and thrown together in those mag- 
nificent structures. The material advancement of civil- 
ization has been the discovery of the objects, forces and 
laws of nature and their use in inventions serviceable 
to man. All forces and laws of nature were discovered 
only as they made manifest through objects in the ma- 
terial world.” Without conceptions of time and place, 
which enter into all relations of life, there would be no 
history, no registration of facts to be remembered, there- 
fore no advancement in civilization. 
Time and place of birth, the outstanding crises and
-P-A-G-E-142
  142 THE SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE 
events of life, add zest to life and give clearer concep- 
tions in all these relations. They are outstanding as 
showing for us the benign purpose of our Craton: in 
working out the highest good. 
The historian registers the outstanding events in life 
marked by time and place, and places before our vision 
in word pictures the crises of nations and individuals, so 
history must be accorded a large place in our considera- 
tion of life’s benefits. 
One writer has said: “ Wonderful is a good book of 
history. From that book come all great men that inspire 
us, all great criminals that warn us. Nothing is more 
stimulating to ambition, more worthy of eager youth 
and self-respecting old age. Read good books, good 
books of history especially ”—which record events and 
crises of life in time and place. 
It has been said that “ the accuracy of precepts depend 
on experience.” Experience comes from memory or 
record of events as they may occur at a certain time and 
at a certain place. As Betts says, “In the perception of 
space we must come to perceive distance, direction, size 
and form. Probably the most fundamental part of our 
idea of time is progression or change, without which there 
could be no progress or forward advance in any line.” 
For our convenience that our minds may more readily 
grasp duration of time we bring into our vision mathe- 
matical calculations, dividing time into years, months, 
weeks, days, that events may be given a distinct place 
and set time in our historical records. Without this per- 
ception of time and place all historical fact could not re- 
main clearly distinct, and memory would be blotted out 
in the mottled conglomeration of a meaningless world. 
In fact all thinking depends upon experiences and ex- 
perience must. recognize places, events as distinct from
-P-A-G-E-143
  TIME AND PLACE 148 
other events and time within which events occur. 
“Nothing can enter our present experience which does 
not link itself to something in your past experience,” in 
time and place. 
TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. Time an integral part of eternity measured only by succes- 
sion of events. Place marks a space in the unfathomable uni- 
verse. 
2. Histories record events occurring at a certain time and 
place; by these marks or conceptions we record them in our 
memories, 
3. Great events of history are featured in this way and may 
point us to higher ideals. They are often the pivotal points in 
the lives of nations. 
4. The great battles of the great world war, in American his- 
tory, in national crises. 
5. The accomplishments of peace and the marked advance in 
peace methods. 
6. Without conceptions of time and place there could be no 
history, and no advance in civilization. 
7. These historical facts add zest to life, aspiration to national 
and individual vision. 
8. Recommendation to study history which inspires us and at 
the same time warns us.

ARTICULATE SPEECH AND WRITTEN 
LANGUAGE 
showing the goodness of God we find the power of 
articulate speech stands out, contributing largely to 
his welfare. 
To add to the social, domestic, commercial, political 
and industrial life of man, this power of speech as a 
means of communication has been one of the outstand- 
ing features marking the progress of the race. This 
power, together with the written signs or letters, is one 
of the manifestations of the goodness of God in His gifts 
to man. 
From the dawn of history and the most remote tradi- 
tions of man, we see this gift in use as a means of com- 
munication called language. Man through the ages has 
been jealous of this power as noted in the effort of 
parents to teach their children. It comes as a concomi- 
tant of the power to walk uprightly. Children are taught 
these two powers as soon as the mind and physical body 
can receive instruction. And great is the joy of the 
parents when the little one can show his power of speech 
and makes sure that this gift is his own. What a handi- 
cap when it is lacking! It is so keenly needed and so 
highly prized among men, and so intimately associated 
with man’s activities that it appears to be kin to the five 
senses. So, in passing, we would suggest that language 
and power to walk upright with ease, differentiating man 
147 I: considering the many powers and gifts to man
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 SOME ARTS OF LIFE 
from the lower animals, are two of the wonderful mani- 
festations of the goodness of God to mankind. 
In promoting this great power of speech we spend bil- 
lions for the education of our children in teaching them 
to speak the language correctly ; the lack of such educa- 
tion stamps and marks one as lacking in all the associa- 
tions and activities of life. 
Then, the power of translation of language into type 
or letter sounds, so that communication may be had by 
means of printed or written page, is an advance marked 
in the progress of the race toward the higher things of 
life. The invention of movable type by Guttenberg 
marked another gift to man for expediting communica- 
tion by means of the printed page, so that education 
could become more general. The thoughts of man are 
preserved, as it were, in form of books or printed page 
for use at any time and to be opened at his pleasure. 
Just as the song of the singer is recorded and preserved 
for reproduction upon the record of the phonograph at 
any time and in any place, so books may be likened to 
these records. 
So pronounced and so necessary to man’s welfare has 
this gift become that all peoples with any pretension to 
civilization. have adopted a system of rules or laws of 
speech known as Grammar, showing the methods by 
which the language may be spoken correctly. . 
Unlike the senses, the ability to talk, walk and think 
methodically and correctly requires much training and 
special education. Many men never acquire the gift of 
speech to a degree that they can stand before an audience 
with poise, confidence and ability to present a subject 
without embarrassment. 
The power of articulate speech has filled a large place 
in history. When great principles have been at stake and
-P-A-G-E-149
  SPEECH AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE 149 
the life of nations have been in the balance, men with 
keener vision thus gifted, so moved the peoples by elo- 
quent appeal and clear presentation of fact, that monarch 
and populace alike have trembled and quaked before 
them. 
In early Roman and Grecian history, before the in- 
vention of movable type, the orators such as Mark 
Antony, Demosthenes and others could move the popu- 
lace to dangerous degrees of fury, and kings feared and 
trembled before their appeals. 
Also note Paul’s wonderful pleadings before Felix and 
Drusilla ; “ Felix trembled,” and again his wonderful de- 
fence before King Agrippa and his great oration on 
Mars Hill. 
In later times, and during the period of our Revolu- 
tionary War, the speeches of Pitt, Edmund Burke and 
others in the House of Parliament in England made 
King George III quake on his throne. They aroused the 
people of Great Britain to the injustice of their cause 
that enthusiasm was dwarfed and their ardour checked 
in the prosecution of the war against the colonies. As 
a result England was required to employ Hessian mer- 
cenaries to help her cause and fight her battles. 
And to-day we read with great delight the great ora: 
tions of our fathers and the statesmen of our country 
as they plead the cause of our nation in times of stress 
and strain. We never tire of reading and hearing Lin- 
coln’s Gettysburg address or Patrick Henry’s note of 
defiance, and the utterances of others as they voiced their 
sentiment in no uncertain tones in times when the opin- 
ions of men were challenged. 
Again we may consider this gift in its relation to song 
as showing its great contribution to the welfare of man. 
From the earliest times the Hebrew people were accus-
-P-A-G-E-150
    
150 SOME ce OF LIFE 
tomed to chant their praise of Jehovah and send forth 
their songs of Thanksgiving in articulate speech, as in 
Miriam’s song of praise, = song of Moses in his ex- 
pressions of praise for deliverance. We see it in the 
many Psalms of David who sponsored the cause of 
Jehovah on throne and battle-field. 
In the life of church, in worship, the Psalms and 
songs voiced in unison move the people to high spirit 
of exaltation. Women and children alike unite in the 
spirit of reverence and the higher and nobler sentiments 
of life as they join in worship and voice their aspira- 
tions and hopes in song. | 
In all gatherings of social and political character song 
also fills a large part of ne service and program. The 
articulated words set to music, accompanied by instru- 
ments of various kinds, mark a phase of articulate speech 
leading to exhilaration and higher moral ideals. 
In public appeal, in presenting the higher ideals of life 
and character from church pulpit or from political ros- 
trum to influence people to action or observance of any 
program, the power of persuasion can be emphasized in 
address or oration by personality and appropriate ges- 
ture, making the appeal more effective. 
In domestic, industrial and commercial life this gift 
is almost incalculable in that it supplies and facilitates 
all means of communication, expedites expression and 
purpose, and lubricates the wheels of action. The 
training of children in the home or school, church or 
business world would slow down, the movements halt, 
and life would be dwarfed without this gift so essential 
to effective expression. The wheels of industry would 
move very slowly were it not for the power of men to 
exchange ideas and plan through speech. The building 
of the Tower of Babel and confusion of tongues, as ex-
-P-A-G-E-151
  
SPEECH AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE 151 
pressed by the Biblical writer, might be considered a fair 
illustration of what would happen without the power of 
articulate speech. 
Also in commercial life, so highly organized to suit the 
necessities of man, this gift figures largely in facilitating 
business. Men talk things over, exchange ideas, counter 
and parry as they move among their fellow men acquir- 
ing information, preparing for purchase or sale of their 
goods and products. Thus we see that for the advance- 
ment of civilization, for education, for commercial and 
industrial, religious and political purpose, this gift must 
be cherished, preserved and be cultivated as it may lead 
us on to the higher methods of communication; shall we 
call it telepathy? To fix an idea or plan within the 
mind a formula of speech is almost unfailing. 
Since speech has been translated into the printed page 
and preserved in book form and magazine, we may look 
to see how these have contributed to the welfare of 
mankind. 
The newspapers of to-day, some ponderous in the ex- 
treme, the magazines, periodicals and books, all issued 
with a view to enlighten in some line of education or 
phase of life, serve a great purpose in broadening man’s 
horizon along all lines. One man at the age of ninety- 
eight remarks that reading newspapers every day had 
contributed to his longevity. He had taken five papers 
every day for many years, and read them; so he recom- 
mended the reading of papers for stimulating the ‘mind 
and adding to length of life. 
So along all lines of life in the home amid the cares 
of domestic life, in teaching baby to talk and sing, and 
in industrial life in expediting the use of machinery by 
communication, and in commercial life, we see the won-
-P-A-G-E-152
  152 SOME ARTS OF LIFE 
derful contribution to man in the gift of articulate speech 
and expression by printed or written page. 
The great orators, poets, historical writers, travellers 
and explorers, all can resort to the printed page in maga- 
zine or book form to let the world kriow of their 
thoughts and findings in life. 
How the burning words of Portia, as painted by 
Shakespeare in his “Merchant of Venice,” have cut 
their way into the hearts of men through the centuries 
as she demanded of Shylock that if the pound of flesh 
be taken it must be nearest the heart without shedding 
a drop of blood. How her words pierce the hearts of 
the extortioners and the greedy as they would demand 
the pound of flesh. 
These, with other great teachings of Shakespeare, in- 
spire our lives to-day. The great lessons of the poets 
and historians framed in phrases and thought to suit are 
here preserved as a foundation for our thought and in- 
spiration. 
Figuratively speaking, we dwell in cities that we did 
not build, so to speak, and enjoy the fruits of labours 
for which we did not sweat. 
“Ours is a goodly heritage” through articulate speech 
and written language. We live through the moods, the 
heartburnings, the longings, regrets and ecstasies of 
other years and of other peoples as we review their writ- 
ings and live their lives in thought and mood, make com- 
panions of men and women whose characters we admire. 
All these things are for the purpose of lifting us to 
higher conceptions of life, duty and obligation, that we 
may acquire a clearer appreciation of the beautiful, the 
true and the good. 
A prominent writer says, “ Thought itself is impos- 
sible without words.” And there is no thought without
-P-A-G-E-153
  SPEECH AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE = 153 
language, spoken, written or some other expression. It 
may be by the face, action, attitude or a combination of 
expressions. Thought itself begets action and expression 
in language or life. But language spoken or written is 
the great means of transmission of thought. 
J. Arthur Thomson says: “Man stands apart from 
animals in his power of building up general ideas and 
of using them in the guidance of his behaviour and con- 
duct. Some animals have words, but man has language 
(Logos). Some animals show evidence of perceptual 
inference, but man often goes byond this to conceptual 
inference (reason).” 
TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. Power of speech necessary in social, domestic and industrial 
relations of life, as shown by history. 
2. Billions of dollars spent on education to foster language 
and speech. The importance shown in efforts upon the infant 
to foster speech.

MUSIC AND SONG 
N the laws of music, classified as one of the fine 
I arts, we find a contribution to the welfare of mankind 
showing the goodness and wisdom of God. 
From earliest history, and among all peoples, music 
has furnished much of the great pleasure and has entered 
into most of the joys of individual life, also in congre- 
gational gatherings both for recreational and religious 
purposes. 
From the dawn of creation music has enraptured the 
soul of life with her symphonies. As the poet, when 
first aroused by the beauties of God’s creations and being 
lifted upon the wings of inspiration, he pictured the time 
when “The Morning Stars sang together and the sons 
of God shouted for joy.” 
The people of earliest times in their homes, at fire- 
sides and community gatherings, sang the praises of the 
Creator and His wonderful goodness to the children of 
men. 
The history of Israel is marked by its beautiful con- 
ceptions in poetic songs as seen in the song of Miriam 
and the inspirational notes of the Psalmists as they chant 
their lays in praise and song. In the songs of Solomon, 
in the spiritual conceptions of David and the seers of 
old when they struck their prophetic lyres, they rose to 
their highest and best as they voiced their praises under 
the spell of sacred music. In earliest Babylonian history 
we find the cornet, flute, harp and instruments of solemn 
154
-P-A-G-E-155
  
MUSIC AND SONG 155 
sound, when Nebuchadnezzar and his retinue demanded 
of all men that they bow down before the image which he, 
“ Nebuchadnezzar the King had set up.” Here also we 
find, mingled with the sordid and low spiritual life, the 
highest and most exalted conception of duty and obliga- 
tion to be decided at the sound of the musical instru- 
ments as noted in the history of “ Daniel.” 
Among the Grecians in the mythological legends we 
find Pan piping to the woodland fairies and Ulysses 
filling the ears of his ship crew and tying himself to the 
mast in order to keep from falling under the spell of 
siren songs. 
The Indian chants his war song as he prepares for the 
attack; the negro sings or hums his melody as he 
labours under the midday sun in cotton fields. It is said 
that the Filipinos, who are known as a musical people, 
will increase their output of production in the fields 
twenty per cent when working under the spell of music 
and song. 
Shakespeare has said: “ The man who has no music 
in himself nor is moved with concord of sweet sounds 
is fit for treason, stratagem and spoils.” The Chinese 
with their crude tom-tom and incantations presume to 
raise the spirits by their enchantments. When the mar- 
tial strains of the “ Marseillaise” reaches the French- 
man’s ear, or when the Britain’s veins swell to the tune 
of “God Save the King,” or the American’s vision is 
inspired by the “ Star-Spangled Banner,” men are moved 
to heroic deeds and martial valour begotten as under the 
spell of a muse divine. In our religious and patriotic 
celebrations, in church and state, men and women and 
children rise to their highest conception of duty and 
obligation under the swelling emotions of choral or in- 
dividual song. The souls and minds of men respond as

if attuned by chords of sympathy to the harmonies lying. 
back and under the musician’s charm. 
Another writer, commenting upon the art of music, 
says: “ This child possesses one radiant attribute which 
signalizes it from all its sisters (sculpture, painting and 
architecture). It floats on the air, it touches not the 
earth with its feet. It is well-nigh incorporeal. Its ma- 
terial is transparent. It is sonorous air. It is almost 
nature itself. It is free.’—FERRuCcIo Busont. 
The same writer, comparing music with the above arts, 
says: “Have you ever noticed how people gaze open- 
mouthed at the brilliant illumination of a hall? »They 
never do so at the million-fold brighter sunshine of 
noonday.” 
as The jazz band or the organ-grinder with monkey need 
only to sound the first note to arouse the sleeping or play- 
ful emotions of children who respond with eager feet and 
joyful heart td thé call of Orpheus. 
The croaking of the frog, the neighing of the horse, 
the mooing of the cow, the humming of the bee, and 
the crickets and katydid with their peculiar notes, as well 
. es the beautiful whistlings of whippoorwill, together with 
.@ the sweet carols of the canary or mocking-bird, all call 
~ us to consider His goodness as the music of the world 
* moves men to higher and nobler activities and ideals. 
One writer, sounding the praises of music, says: 
* Song is the one expression for all occasions. It com- 
forts the saddest, soothes the ferocious, adds zest to the 
nomination or home run. It gives joy, it brings power, 
it lifts our heels and carries them through intricate steps. 
It sends our thoughts wandering, we forget the limita- 
tions that bind us to one personality. We are Pagliacci, 
Lohengrin, Carmen. We are the waves that beat against 
the salt cliffs, the clatter of cavalry, languor of the

Orient, gleaners under autumn skies. We are quick 
with the radiance of love, of sacrifice, of eternity. 
Music leaves us better and happier; we forget our 
bank accounts if we have them, or we may be as happy 
without them under the spell of the muse of music. 
We sing, we pray, we laugh, we eat and drink and play 
under the siren notes. When in ecstasies the bard would 
give vent to his highest inspiration or poetic vision, the 
lyre and song may lend aid to his swelling emotions. 
Music may be called the gospel of harmony in 
variety. The Christmas carol, the halleluiah chorus, all 
quickén: our thoughts and sympathies as they bring to 
our minds in song and melody the memories of the 
Christmas-tide. ‘ 
“When Longfellow desired to paint a poetic picture of 
freedom from the burdens of life, he said: 
“And the nights shall be filled with, #psic, 
And the cares that infest the day : 
Shall’ fold their tents like the Arabs, 
And as silently steal away.” 
In speaking of the music of nature as he found it im. 
the beautiful Yosemite, and enraptured by the music.of ~ 
the great water falls and the beautiful Merced river, 
John Muir says: 
“Sing on brave Merced, fresh from your snowy fountains: 
plash and swirl and dance to your fate in the sea, bathing, cheer 
ing every living thing along your way.” 
And of the Bridal Veil Falls he pictures it as singing 
in the winds, clad in gauzy, sun-sifted spray, half falling, 
half floating, it seems infinitely gentle and fine. But the 
hymn it sings tells of the solemn, fateful power beneath 
its soft (white veil) clothing. 
How the poets love to write of music of nature as it  
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 SOME ARTS OF LIFE 
appeals in the thunder-storm or winds whistling through 
the forests or the waves of the sea as they dash upon 
the rocks. Note how Longfellow, in the beginning of 
the beautiful poem “Evangeline,” says: 
“Ye who believe in affection that hopes and endures and is 
patient, 
List to the mournful tradition still sung by the pines of the 
forest.” 
Or as another writer says as he would picture the 
music of the Happy Isles: 
“Oh the mountain music of the mountain isles, 
There cool winds are singing 
And crystal waters flinging 
Their diamond dancing laughter about the Happy Isles.” 
And another poet entranced by the flow of the “ Silver 
Apron” pictures it as a variety of creeping, murmuring 
streams: 
“That leap madly over precipice, or dash with reckless speed 
through rocky chasm. 
Singing loudly and merrily.” 
Then again as: 
“Leaping, shouting in wild exultant energy over rough boulder 
dam, joyful, beautiful.” 
Tennyson’s “ Harold” says: 
“Love is come with a smile and a song, 
Love will stay for a whole life long.” 
“Thou art my music; would your wings were mine.” 
As we look further and consider music in its relation 
to song, we see some of the poetic expressions as crys- 
tallized in vision and then emphasized in music and song.
-P-A-G-E-159
MUSIC AND SONG 159 
These poetic visions as they picture the wonderful good- 
ness of the Creator are reinforced by the harmonies of 
music. 
Come, O my soul, in sacred lays, 
Attempt thy great Creator’s praise,

through their sense of the goodness of God, justice, 
mercy and love; and to the altruistic sense of 
courtesy and kindness. In all ages when men have 
striven for the higher ideals of life and character the 
outstanding marks of their writings have embraced these 
appeals. 
The writer of historical facts finds a ready response 
in reciting the appeals to gratitude, justice and love in 
fringing out the scenes with these colours in their pic- 
tures. You will see this in the expression “et tu, 
Brute!” in the death of Julius Caesar and in the appeals 
of Mark Antony in his oration over the body of Caesar, 
as depicted by Shakespeare. 
A special touch of interest is given when a scene pic- 
tures magnanimity of spirit in a great man as painted 
by the historian in describing the “Surrender at Appo- 
mattox,” where General Grant returns the sword to Gen- 
eral Lee. Note how the student grasps the facts of his- 
tory when a scene is described such as “ Socrates drink- 
ing the hemlock” or the vanishing race of the American 
Indians. And how the patriotic flame is revived when 
the writers picture the scene of Lord Nelson at the naval 
battle of Trafalgar. Or it may be seen in the description 
of the martyrdom of Latimer and Ridley with the hero- 
ism and tenacious purpose to spread the light. We see 
it as the appeal reaches the reader of history when he

girl on the auction block in. New Orleans: as Lincoln 
stood there as a young man and looked on he said: “If _

Such appeals to the sympathies and self-sacrificing spirit 
of humanity fan the spark into a flame, arouse a passion 
« & — for service and lead to the higher ideals of life. 
In*poetry, whether epic, lyric or dramatic, the appeal 
~ 8°. can be made to the sympathy for the suffering, thought- 
«ful, lovely’and.chi¥alrous, relating to both God and man, 
Ms as the poet Coleridge say’ in the “ Ancient Mariner ”: - . Iy

‘ In our-songs for the uplift gf character to stimulate 
, religious, patriotic and domestic fervour, and with music 
to reinforce ge conception, the highest reaches are found 
in such appeals. ) ‘ 
In the Psalms of David the appeals are centered upon 
the goodness and wisdom of God as in the following 
lines: 
“Oh, that men would praise the Lord for His goodness, 
And His wonderful works to the children of men.” 
aS In Longfellow’s “Evangeline” our sympathies are 
drawn out to the heroine in her faithful search for 
Gabriel, her betrothed; and her love, courage and en- 
-deavour manifest in the quest for her lover. 
In Tennyson’s “In Memoriam ” our finer feelings are 
* touched when the writer gives vent to his great love and 
longing as he utters the cry: 
“But, oh, for thé touch of the vanished hand, 
The sound ofa voice that is still.”

Even in mythological lore, as in Homer’s “*‘ iad,” we 
see the appeal and interest clustering around and enfold- 
ing the sentiment of love, affection and patriotism thrown 
into this wonderful work of poetic art. - 
In fiction, the novel or almost any class of literature; 
this principle is outstanding as the mos¢ important fac-

the normal soul responds to the finer feelings of

If you will study the goodness of God as suggested 
by the Psalmist, and the goodness of life and character 
of any good man, you will be drawn to it. You will 
note this in the simple story of Hawthorne’s “ Great 
Stone Face.” It follows a natural law of psychology 
from which you cannot escape) 
If you grasp the pathos of those sidnitessul stanzas: 
“ Break, break, break,” you will enter into the longing 
spirit of the author. 
(If you will dwell upon the self-sacrificing spirit of the 
character Sydney Carton in the “Tale of Two Cities,” 
by Dickens, you must be drawn to the wonderful spirit 
of the man who is willing to lay down his life for his 
riends. ~ 
( If you can contemplate the fine spirit depicted in the 
character of Jean Valjean, in “ Les Miserables,” by Vic- 
tor Hugo, and that stormy but sympathetic life, you 
must be drawn to it. } 
Or take up the. story “ Over the Hills from the Poor- 
house,” by Will Carleton, and see the fine flavour of 
love and affection’ shown by the wayward boy and the 
-wonderfut response of mother love, then hold in con- 
trast’ the spirit of the other five members of the “ Dea- 
con’s Six,”-you will find that you are drawn to the way- 
eward, boy. 
« Tf you will study the characters as depicted by Oliver 
Wefdell Holmes in the wonderful word picture “The 
Boys,” and follow the delineation of the characters in

fall upon the one outstanding figure of “ The Boys.” He

points out this boy towards the last, but he is outstand- 
ing at the first: ; 
” 
“You hear that boy laughing, you think he’s all fun, 
But the angels laugh too at the good he has done, 
And the children laugh loud as they troop to his call, 
And the dear ones that know him laugh loudest of all.” 
Again when you read that beautiful poem by an un- 
known writer called “ Flying Jim’s Last Leap,” and note 
the contrast between the spirit of Aunt Hannah and lit- 
tle Flossie; then the fine sacrificing spirit of Jim when 
the crisis comes for action. When the fertilizing spirit 
or pollen of kindness reached the soul of the Tramp and 
he had become impregnated or born again by the spirit 
of kindness, and how it makes a hero out of a criminal, 
you are drawn and touched by the heroic spirit of the 
man and the gentle kindness of little Flossie. 
Here we have a new productive triangle—courtesy, 
kindness and good-will. Courtesy and kindness beget 
good-will. 
In Shakespeare’s “ The Winter’s Tale” we can see the 
appeal of the kindly offices of Paulina, the humble but 
a attitude of Perdita, and the self-sacrificing 
“Queen Hermione” in contrast to the haughty, jealous 
spirit of Leontes. The contrast of characters, so marked 
in their attitude to nature’s world lariguage—sympathy 
and love—brings out the wonderful lessons of altruism 
versus selfishness. This drama alone would mark” the ae 
author as a man with altruistic vision. ? 
(When we take up that wonderful tragedy, “ e. 
beth,” we see how the pangs and burnings of conscience 
flutter around and dart at the soul of Macbeth 4s he’ 
tries to remove “the bloodstains from his hands.) 5 
And how the burning words of Portia in the “ Mer- q é »

chant of Venice” sink into the soul of the extortioner, 
Shylock, when he hears the verdict: 
“Take thou the pound of flesh; 
But in the cutting, if thou dost shed 
One drop of Christian blood, 
Thy land and goods 
Are by the laws of Venice confiscate: 
For as thou urgest justice, be assured 
Thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest.” 
Note the wonderful eloquence of Portia as she pleads 
the cause of Antonio and sets forth the demands of 
mercy: 
“The quality of mercy is not strained, 
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven, 
Upon the place beneath, it is twice blessed, 
It blesses him that gives and him that takes. 
’Tis mightiest in the mightiest, it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown, 
His scepter shows the force of temporal power, 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 
Therein doth set the dread and fear of kings; 
But mercy is above his sceptered sway, 
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 
It is an attribute of God himself.” 
In the “Tale of Two Cities,” by Dickens, how the 
heart is drawn out to the character of Sydney Carton 
when he says: 
“T can always work other people’s sums, but my own I can- 
not solve.” 
Without any adornment the two parables, “The 
Prodigal Son” and “The Good Samaritan,” suggest a 
beauty of life and character to be emulated by men in 
all contacts of life. 
It was discerned by orators long ago, and is practiced

LITERATURE 171 
by many public speakers and writers to-day, that a 
strong appeal to the sympathies of hearers and readers 
is found in quotations from books and writings with 
which there is a mutual familiarity and interest. Also 
that the mention of places, nationalities, or sympathetic 
lines of thought of mutual interest tends to increase and 
stimulate an intensity of emotion in hearers and readers. 
We note how Lincoln in his great debates with Judge 
Douglas caught the interest of his hearers when he, 
Lincoln, would quote in his arguments, “A house di- 
vided against itself cannot stand. I believe this gov- 
ernment cannot endure permanently half slave and half 
free.” The appeal was founded on a passage and a book 
with which multitudes were familiar and held in sacred 
reverence. 
And what a sense of distrust comes into the mind 
when one quotes: “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the 
hands are the hands of Esau.” What a sense of re- 
sponsibility and care rushes into the conceptions of men 
when the familiar quotation from Pope’s “Essay on 
Criticism” is quoted: “ Fools rush in where angels fear 
to tread.” What a picture of remorse and guilty con- 
science comes to our vision when one quotes from Poe’s 
“Raven”: “Take thy beak from out my heart, take 
thy form from off my door; Quoth the Raven, ‘ Never- 
more.’ ” 
And further, in consideration of poetic verse, we note 
that great thoughts and conceptions may be encased 
within a verse or stanza carrying conviction and sug- 
gestions which in prose could not be conveyed without 
prolixity and a multitude of words. 
Various moods and emotions may be suggested by 
some of the following stanzas, which show also the

PATRIOTISM 
Lives there a man with soul so dead 
Who never to himself hath said, 
“This is my own, my native land.” 
Whose heart hath ne’er within him burned, 
As home his footsteps he hath turned 
From wanderings on a foreign strand? 
If such there be, go mark him well, 
For him no rapturous minstrel swell; 
High though his title, proud his name; 
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim, 
The wretch, concentered all in self; 
Despite his boundless power and pelf, 
Shall return to earth from whence he came 
Unwept, unhonored and unsung.

Hang the almanac’s cheat and the catalogue’s spite, 
Old time is a liar, we are twenty to-night. 
We're twenty, we're twenty, who says we are more? 
He’s tipsy young jack-a-napes, show him the door. 
Gray temples at twenty? Yes, white, if you please, 
Where the snowflakes fall thickest there nothing can freeze. 
Was it snowing I spoke of? Excuse the mistake; 
Look close, you will see not a sign of a flake. 
We want some new garlands for those we have shed, 
And these are white roses instead of the red. 
We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told, 
Of speaking in public as if we were old. 
That boy we call Doctor, and this we call Judge, 
It’s a neat little fiction—of course it’s all fudge. 
That fellow’s the Speaker, the one on the right, 
Mr. Mayor, my young one, how are you to-night? 
There’s our Member of Congress, we say when we chaff, 
And there’s the Reverend, what’s his name, don’t make me laugh. 
That boy with the grave, mathematical look, 
Made believe he’d written a wonderful book, 
And the Royal Society thought it was true, 
And they took him right in, a good joke it was, too. 
That boy, we pretend, with the three-decker brain, 
Could harness a team with a logical chain, 
When he spoke for our manhood, in syllabled fire, 
We called him the Justice, but now he’s the Squire. 
There’s a nice youngster, of excellent pith, 
Fate tried to conceal him by calling him Smith, 
But he shouted a song for the brave and the free. 
Just read on his medal: “My Country, of Thee.” 
Do you hear that boy laughing? You think he’s all fun, 
But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done.

COLOUR, NATURE’S ART 
nature, the handmaid of our Great Creator, has 
wrought out as with a sculptor’s chisel the various 
forms of life and has performed the functions of the 
Supreme Sculptor. And as the Supreme Architect has 
laid the foundations of the mountains, hills and valleys 
with their outstanding grandeur, with all their appeals 
of utility and pleasure, so we may now consider and 
muse upon His wonderful creative genius in the field 
of colour. 
In considering the goodness of God we must see how 
colour contributes to the welfare of mankind. We may 
call it Nature’s Art. 
As the notes of music are to the ear, with the range 
of seven keys or notes within the octave called the scale, 
so the colours of the spectrum ranging from the red 
through the spectral series: red, orange, yellow, green, 
blue, indigo and violet, may be to the eye as the impres- 
sions are received. And, as there are many variations of 
tone and pitch in music, so in colour there may be many 
corresponding shades and variations within the spectral 
zone. 
Colour appears to be one of the great gifts of God 
contributing to man’s welfare. It may be considered 
from the point of felicity or joys, also from the stand- 
point of utility or usefulness, and a combination of these 
two view-points. UD ae: individuality and form, we have seen how 
182
-P-A-G-E-183
COLOUR, NATURE’S ART 183 
The beautiful flower, as it may grow in the field or 
garden which appeals to the eye and calls forth many 
expressions of delight, may also be useful in the propa- 
gation of the species. As we consider colour from the 
standpoint of utility we find it filling a large place. One 
may conceive that colour, with its appeal to the eye, in 
early times might have drawn man to the blossoms of 
the fruit trees for the purpose of noting the fruit and 
arousing his curiosity in watching its development. The 
blossom fades but the fruit continues to grow with prac- 
tically the same colour as the leaves until the time of 
harvest is near. Then the fruit puts on another colour 
which again attracts man to the tree. Lo, and behold! 
the fruit has matured, it is mellow and with sweet odour, 
together with appetizing flavour, so he regards it as good 
for food. After seeing that it is good for food, he begins 
to cultivate the tree. The blossom has also an attraction 
for the bee and insects which carry the pollen for 
fertilization. 
All nature appears to be provided with colour to suit 
the vision of mankind. The green grass and verdure of 
the forest are the soft shades most suitable to the more 
constant vision and exposure of the eye, as also the blues 
of ocean, sky, and many shades in all nature. They are 
restful and non-exciting in their reflections of light. 
When nature wishes to warn of danger in the common 
experiences of life the flash of lightning or bright lights 
of fire running through the spectral colours, red, orange 
or yellow, are called into play, and from these colours 
we note the dangers of fire and electrical disturbances. 
There is also a function of colour in the scheme of 
natural selection in the propagation of animal life as well 
as in vegetable life. The bright colours arouse the more 
vivacious emotions of the opposite sex. Chanticleer,
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 SOME ARTS OF LIFE 
with his flaming comb, attracts and excites the subdued 
and demure hen. The turkey gobbler with his exuber- 
ance of red likewise has the same appeal. 
In vegetation colour plays a very important part in 
propagation. The bee is attracted to the beautiful blos- 
som and sips the honey, carries the pollen away. The 
next blossom is fertilized by the pollen thus carried. In 
this way nature provides for fertilization through the 
beautiful flower as the insects, drawn by colour and 
odour, carry the pollen to blossoms remote. Other in- 
sects, birds and animals are influenced by colour or 
odour, and in this way fertilize vegetation. The Smyrna 
fig is propagated by the insect life known as the Blasto- 
phaga. It is first attracted to the blossom of the Capri 
or wild fig of Arabia, then carries the juices or pollen 
to the Smyrna, commonly called in California the Cali- 
smyrna fig. The blossom, in the case of the fig, lies 
within the fig, but accessible to the insect. 
Not only in the botanical and agricultural world does 
colour fill a very useful place in contributing to the wel- 
fare of man, but in the picturesque scenery of landscape, 
in the charm of the mountain fastnesses, amid the colour- 
ing of tree, vine or forest leaves, as they change their 
shades and don the dress of autumnal hues, as if in 
preparation for the coming adieu to the friends of moun- 
tain kin. 
Again in the green verdure of the meadow with the 
lowing herd, striped with nature’s coat of many colours, 
and amid the fleecy flock with rich white coat with

It may be as we watch the birds of bright plumage or 
darker hues which assimilate from nature’s bountiful 
supply, all colours of the rainbow in preparation for 
adornment of milady or for man’s charm and wonder.

The coloured rocks may mark the wealth in gold or 
silver ore, or it may be in the black strata of coal, the 
white sand of ocean beach, or among the many shades 
of rock and shale as our eyes feast upon the painted 
forest of Arizona, or the shales of Yellowstone mingled 
with the phantom-like arms of the great geysers. It may 
be the beauty of the clouds when the morning sun or 
evening glow changes the mist and cloud to rainbow 
beauty. Or it may be the running stream prancing and 
leaping over rock with splashing spray, now a rainbow 
effect as seen under the Vernal, or Bridal Veil Falls, of 
Yosemite, then the white, rolling mist as it settles down 
to the dark hues of the common stream. 
It may be among the beautiful animals of God’s crea- 
tion in the stripes of tiger or zebra, the leopard spots, 
the brownish coat of the lion or darker and sombre hue 
of the elephant. 
Again it may be among the domestic animals with 
colours mingled in dainty stripes or solid coat as we note 
the Holstein or Jersey, or the horse (man’s load lifter), 
whose colours range from pure white and stripes to the 
jet black with raven mane. 
In the dress of all nations colour plays a large part 
in life’s chapter. In army and navy regalia and uniform 
colour schemes, wrought out in many designs, mark 
grades, rank, power and authority; or it may be in the 
rank and file of the common soldier, the shoulder mark- 
ings, the chevron stripes, and lines upon the wristbands, 
all speak of authority and service. The insignia of mili- 
tary or navy uniform marked by colour or colour dress 
may speak of the department and the branch of the de- 
partment. 
The flags of various nations, with their colours, strip- 
ings and designs, shades and hues, are an interesting

study, depicting the psychology, sentiment, form of gov- 
ernment, and even the type of civilization. 
By colour and form, the American flag with its broad 
field-of blue with the setting of bright stars, signifying 
the many states, yet the one nation, the streaming colours 
of white and red speak of purity and love, and the whole 
typifying the highest spirit of brotherhood and good- 
will. Colour marks here the nobility of sentiment and 
higher ideals of the Republic. Again the Union Jack or 
British national emblem, with its colours and cross strip- 
ing with the many and varying designs, speak of the Brit- 
ish character and the many peoples embraced within her 
dominion. So on through the world the flag stands as 
an exponent of the character and purpose of the peoples 
over which it flies. On the field of battle the flag with 
its streaming colours has a psychological effect upon the 
soldier and sailor, renewing courage as it floats in mid- 
air, or carried forward, leading the charge or holding 
ground. Or it may be seen to fall amid the rush and 
charge of battalions, thus speaking of imminent danger 
and threatened defeat, causing either renewed energy in 
battle or a depression of spirit. 
The waving of the battle flag has saved many an army 
when defeat was threatening and courage failing. The 
flag is also used as an insignia or symbol in directing 
military and naval operations, the colours marking com- 
mand and movement. 
The singing of the “ Star-Spangled Banner,” with its 
lofty sentiment of courage and loyalty symbolizing sacri- 
fice and endurance, or waving it aloft amid the dangers 
of battle, will renew the spirits of men and snatch vic- 
tory out of threatening defeat. The waving of the flag 
may be pictured as stimulating courage, endurance and 
"service.

COLOUR, NATURE’S ART 187, 
Colour is the basis or key of signaling in railroad 
traffic, warning or advising by means of various coloured 
lights, both by night and by day. Likewise ocean steam- 
ers and light-house warnings, the street traffic and car 
signals are given by colours flashed or plainly seen. 
The merchants with stores, along business lines of com- 
mercial life, use the bright and coloured lights in pro- 
moting trade as they advertise their wares. 
Colour fills a very large place in many other lines of 
advertising. It functions in society among the more dis- 
criminating who plan and seek for harmonies in colour 
scheme and dress with a view to matching complexion 
with colours apropos. Women especially have become 
very skilled in arranging dress, material and colour in a 
manner pleasing to the eye. To-day ladies are keen ‘in 
their observance of dress, and any violation of colour 
scheme by inappropriate matching of colours to suit form 
and figure, may be subject to remark and even criticism 
in some circles. This keenness of perception and har- 
monious planning has been very educational in a way, 
so that this sense being highly developed, has quickened 
many other traits of character, leading to sanitation, 
hygiene, and a keener observance of the beautiful, the 
true and the good. ° 
Among milliners and those educated in the arts of 
dress a violation of colour scheme and harmonious adorn- 
ment meets with a frown which may be parried only by 
acceptance of their judgment. 
Colour is well associated with the harmonies of nature, 
and moves along with the education and refinements of 
society. When man awakes to the real beauties of nature, 
the harmonies of the heavens, the colourings of clouds, 
the charm of life in pigments, he comes close to the call 
of the Psalmist as he exclaims: “ When I consider thy:
-P-A-G-E-188
  ‘188 SOME ARTS OF LIFE 
heavens the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars 
which thou hast ordained, what is man that thou art 
mindful of him,” etc. 
The Michael Angelos, Rembrandts, and all the great 
artists of history are admired for their vision and skill 
in placing on the canvas in face, form and landscape the 
expressions depicting nature in colours, and as we often 
say, “true to nature.” 
The language of colours spoken by flowers and dress 
has become so prevalent that the expression is common: 
“Say it with flowers.” ‘The violet speaks of thoughts, 
the rose of affection, and carnation of character. The 
darker, somber hues of dress may speak of the departed 
under certain conditions, and a dress of bright, flashing 
colours at some services may be considered offensive if 
not almost sacrilegious. 
Colour and colour schemes have become so woven into 
the fiber of our character that they are recognized as 
having an exhilarating or depressing effect upon our dis- 
position. Men and women are careful of the adornments 
of homes and rooms. The sitting room and library may 
require very different colour finishings; the kitchen still 
another, and the bedroom ‘another to harmonize with fur- 
niture and moods to match. 
The bright and coloured lights of the city attract youth 
with alluring appeal. So in all gatherings where appeal 
to youth is made the brighter lights are apropos. The 
varying and shorter wave motions marked by length and 
rapidity, producing colour as they move more rapidly 
from red to the ultra violet, have been instrumental in 
discoveries, helpful to surgery and dentistry, as they 
have been able to penetrate and photograph the interior 
of the human body by Roentgen rays. 
A noted scientist, in his treatment of animal life in
-P-A-G-E-189
  
{ COLOUR, NATURE’S ART 189 
Bionomics, says that the inherent power of some animals 
to change their colour to conform to their environment 
serves as a protection from their enemies in seasons of 
greater danger. The rabbits and animals of the polar 
regions change their colour to suit the season and en- 
vironment. The female of nearly all animal life, ex- 
posed to dangers from which she cannot easily escape, 
has donned the colours of feather or skin less attractive 
than the male, and approaching the shades of the general 
environment in order that she may escape notice, and not 
be subject to disturbance during the hatching season, and 
as a protection from other animals. This is especially 
noted in the protective camouflage of insect life. 
This faculty of “protective resemblance” in animal 
life to change colour to conform to their environment not 
only enables them to escape other animals, but to draw 
within striking distance of their prey. They may change 
not only colour but form to blend with the surroundings. 
Among the insects with this faculty are the span-worm, 
the walking-stick, the praying-mantis, the ivy caterpillar, 
desert lizard and walking-leaf. The last named is a 
native of India and it is said that they sometimes deceive 
the natives, who may take them for transformed leaves. 
This faculty of camouflage is possessed by sea life and 
many reptiles, birds and mammals. 
Referring again to the artists :—to-day two Rembrandts 
sell for $750,000; the most noted picture in the Temple 
of Diana, Apelles’ famous picture of Alexander the 
Great, is valued at $200,000. These are suggested to 
show how men have prized the paintings of great artists 
and the value placed upon colour. 
So in all these matters relating to colour we can see  
-P-A-G-E-190

the wise provision made for man through the laws of 
colour. 
An unknown poet has said: 
“There is not a tint that paints the rose 
Or decks the lily white, 
Or makes the humblest flower that grows 
But God has placed it there. 
There’s not of grass a single blade 
Or leaf of lowliest mien, 
Where heavenly skill is not displayed 
And heavenly goodness seen. -

PURPOSE OF SUFFERING 
HE question of suffering and its benign purpose 
may well come under this caption, showing the 
goodness of God in His relations, adaptations 
and purpose. 
Many will ask, How is the goodness of God shown in 
the sufferings of mankind? Can God be just and good 
in allowing man to suffer under the pressure of these re- 
lationships ? 
It is said that when God had created man He pro- 
nounced him, with all creation, “very good.” To keep 
man good, as proclaimed, a warning voice was given, 
suggesting a penalty for violation of law. Self-indul- 
gence, flouting the command, met the penalty inexorable 
in the first violation as it relates to God. 
As in the case of Cain, jealousy or envy marked the 
violation as related to others. 
In whatever way we may consider the first violation 
of law, as in the case of Adam, or as related to other 
men or neighbours, as in the case of Cain, we note that 
self-indulgence in the former case caused the break. 
In the case of Cain the violation was against his brother, 
which, likewise, led to estrangement and penalty. 
And down through the ages these two phases of viola- 
tion of law—violation directed against God (in contra- 
diction of the law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,”) 
and violation against man (“ Thou shalt love thy neigh- 
bour,” etc.) have been the great outstanding features of 
193
-P-A-G-E-194
194 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
all law violation. The same laws remain inexorable 
to-day. “In the day that thou eatest thereof” (violate 
my law thou shalt surely pay the penalty), suffering 
“must follow. The law must stand and suffering ‘is 
marked not necessarily as punishment for violation, but 
as a disciplinary provision to guard against repetition. 
All good law requires a sufficient penalty. The excuse 
that it will not be as severe as decreed is conceived in 
childishness and is the common plea of law violators. 
As the Psalmist says: “The brutish man knoweth not, 
neither doth a fool understand this.” . ’ 
“God is not mocked, whatsoever a man soweth that 
shall he also reap.” im 
From the earliest times this law of sequence, cause 
and effect in life has been recognized. It has become 
axiomatic: Like will produce like. The warnings are 
held out as a red flag at a railroad crossing, crying 
“stop.” But, again, as the Psalmist says: “ Fools, be- 
cause of their folly, perish.” They heed not, neither do 
they understand. 
As our Creator made provision called penalties for 
violations of law, we must consider them as good. 
‘The writer, in conversation with a wise university doc- 
_ tor, on a railroad train, suggested the permanency and 
stability of law as being good. The wise doctor re- 
marked: “If it were not for this law the railroad would 
‘be clogged with the killed and injured so that the train 
could not pass.” So, without suffering, man would 
perish ; and it might be said that the law of suffering is 
the one great law which saves the human race. It may 
not kill but only.injure as a reminder. Without suffer- 
ing the race would not put violation of law behind and 
make progress towards the goal of righteousness. The 
Biblical writer says: “I reckon that the suffering of 
: 
« . 
ae
-P-A-G-E-195
  PURPOSE OF SUFFERING ' 195 
this present time is not worthy to be compared to the 
weight of glory that shall be revealed in us.” It is an 
economic factor to preserve the race. Suffering was 
then introduced to save the race from obliteration; were 
it not for the suffering and penalty, all men, women and * 
children would become careless and cease to make 
progress towards better conditions of life, in sanitation, 
in treatment of one’s neighbour, laws of health, care of 
the child’s life and other conditions which minister to 
man’s happiness. 
Suffering is as discipline and a schoolmaster to remind 
us, bringing us into line of duty and to perform our 
obligations, also to require us to avoid those conditions 
of life which would pull us down, mutilate our lives and 
eventually destroy them. 
If we put our hands upon a red-hot stove it would 
burn to a crisp if the nerves would not warn the king 
in the palace of the danger by suffering. 
As the suffering of the physical body reflects the 
warning of the nervous system that the parts affected 
need attention, as shown by the chapter on “ The Palace 
We Live In,” so mental suffering, as differentiated from 
the physical, may be caused by the reflection of the. cen- 
sors of the mind which function to warn of dangers and 
abnormal conditions in the relations of the physical body 
to other physical bodies which might hurt or threaten 
injury. Or it may come from a sense of abnormal rela- 
tions in the social, educational, industrial or political life, 
which may reflect such unusual relations causing mental 
suffering. Unless there were mental sufferings from 
these abnormal conditions, the King in the Palace would 
not be advised to remove such conditions and replace 
them with happier relations, bringing back the normal 
mood. : 
‘ & 
a
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
But, as man may flout and ignore the warnings of the 
physical censors, the nerves of the body which report 
dangers to the King in the Palace, so the warning of 
the mental censors or nerves of perception may be ig- 
nored until the penalty of suffering, caused by abnormal 
conditions, may be visited upon the individual. The 
neglect or procrastination in action may lead to the ex- 
treme penalty. 
The wise man will sense and heed the warnings of 
life whether in the physical realm or mental horizon, and 
move to rectify all abnormal conditions whether in body, 
mind or spirit. 
Many such unusual or abnormal conditions may arise 
as purely affecting only the physical or mental life of 
the individual, or these conditions may be associated with 
conscience, the great spiritual censor. This censor rises 
above, but associates with all other censors of the life. 
It peers into all relations of life, accusing or excusing, 
according as the various relations may be just or unjust, 
pure or impure, warning of the dangers of self-indul- 
gence, infringing upon the rights of others and violations 
of the laws of God and humanity. This censor, con- 
science, may be trained and enlightened as the nerves 
of the body and mental perception, in all its activities, 
weighing, adjusting, balancing until the whole man is 
moved with a keen sense of God and recognition of 
courtesy, kindness and good-will. 
“Tis held that sorrow makes us wise 
Whatever wisdom sleeps within.” 
TENNYSON, 
Having observed that suffering is designed to pre- 
serve the mao and contribute to the welfare of mankind,
-P-A-G-E-197
PURPOSE OF SUFFERING 197 
we would naturally look for the sequence of suffering in 
its relation to man. 
Death appears to be the great clearing-house, so to 
speak, or the great reservoir to receive the aches, pains 
and sufferings with the decay of old age, and the torn 
body even by the accidental violation of the inexorable 
law. 
Why should man die or pass beyond the vale of sense? 
The Great Teacher would liken it to the harvest when 
the wheat may be separated from the tares. As the rain 
falls upon the just and unjust alike, so death comes to 
all. As suffering is seen to preserve the race, so death, 
in conformity to the same law or principle, follows auto- 
matically as the ultimate relief from suffering. It is the 
end of suffering and may be considered in this light. 
The maimed body, the distorted mind, the worn-out 
physical machine, so to speak, all remind us that the end 
must come to all imperfections. As the law of decay is 
inexorable, so the law of suffering and death must of 
necessity be inexorable. 
Man is born to die. Whether he reaches the age of 
three score and ten or even four score, the Biblical 
writer reminds us that there is still strength, labour and 
sorrow. 
As we read the lives of men and note the thanatopsis 
of mankind, we see that few men are self-supporting and 
of sufficient strength to enjoy life beyond four score 
years. Man at this age does not consider it a boon to 
live, but rather a joy to pass. The great question is not 
why men pass in old age or why man passes under suf- 
fering, but why childhood, youth and middle life should 
be subject to this inexorable law; or why the innocent 
should suffer for the guilty. 
Death may be considered the extreme penalty, diet not

necessarily a punishment, for violated law, either by the 
person himself or another. However, the penalty is 
suffering and ultimately death. Ignorance, and under- 
estimating conditions may thereby violate law, as the 
prophet says: “Because of ignorance my people perish.” 
Ignorance would say, “We shall not surely die;’ 
prudence and righteous judgment would say, “ Observe 
the law and live.” 
Many men worn with physical pain and suffering 
would welcome a surcease from such life; and a man 
with distorted mind or vision may so imperil the lives 
of others that it would be better for all that he pass. 
We place men in the penitentiary or other prisons, 
dead to mankind, as it were, for violation of law, why 
then may we not consider it a just and providential kind- 
ness for man to pass away? 
The body and mind will ultimately reach the point of 
decay and warped vision so that all men would say it 
is better to pass. Even the most righteous person, when 
in his full vigour of youth, may become, through suffer- 
ing and old age, a person to be feared and to be placed 
under guard. 
The seed of the future happiness of the race is wrapped 
up in death. The only way in which we can reconcile 
the passing of youth, walking i in his integrity and in the 
path of righteousness, is in considering him as a part 
of the whole. A part of the body may suffer and be 
destroyed in order that the rest of the body may be pre- 
served. Ignorance, youth, innocence and guilt, all fall 
under this law of sacrifice, “A pare for sake of the 
whole.” 
So the human family may be considered as one body 
under the inexorable law of suffering and death, which I . 
functions to preserve the whole race. These immutable
-P-A-G-E-199
  PURPOSE OF SUFFERING 199 
laws apply as the rain and weather, they fall upon the 
just and unjust alike. Ignorance is no excuse; whether 
young or old, innocent or guilty, the law would operate 
upon all alike. 
It is evident that the innocent must suffer, also the 
mother for the child and even the innocent for the guilty. 
But the final judgment is with the Giver of Every Good 
and Perfect Gift. 
The grain of corn falls into the ground and does not 
bring forth or produce except it die. The grass grows 
and the fruits ripen and are assimilated, thus destroying 
identity and life, so to speak, that they may produce a 
larger and different body for the higher creation. 
The spider may feast upon the fly, and the wasp like- 
wise upon the spider for the same cause. Or the larger 
fish may live upon the smaller fish, and it likewise upon 
the minnow, thus producing and reproducing from the 
lower to the higher creations until man is reached, who 
feeds upon the vegetable, fish and cattle. 
Were it not that man passes away as provided under 
these laws, man would be kept so busy providing for the 
old and decrepid that the children of the youth could 
not be provided for or receive nourishment. In fact, 
the whole would become unbearable, and mankind would 
be destroyed by conservatism. We need the new life 
and the progressive spirit of youth which would be 
checked were men allowed to cumber the earth in old 
age. 
It is good, therefore, that the laws of suffering and 
death are inexorable ; that the new life-giving stream 
may abound and then, having run its course, to likewise 
pass away. 
“Without the shedding of blood (as suffering and 
 
-P-A-G-E-200

death) there is no remission,” or putting behind the evils 
and imperfections of life. 
It requires the young life to properly sense and vision 
the needs of life as man progresses towards the higher 
ideals. 
It would appear therefore that suffering and death 
may be considered as necessary and economic expedi- 
ents for the preservation and development of mankind, 
also as benign factors in working out the swmmum 
bonum for the race. 
But as the great apostle might say: “Yet I show 
unto you a more excellent way,” as these reflect their 
purpose in the final destiny of man in the purpose of life. 
What a fine tribute to life dnd its issues were voiced 
in the memorable words of Mrs. Harding, spoken in the 
following beautiful lines: 
“Let me see his face. =~ 
He was magnificent in life; 
He is still more wonderful in death.” 
(Spoken at the closirig of the casket of the President 
at the Palace Hotel,.San Francisco.)

TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. Can our great Creator be just and good in allowing man to 
suffer? Why suffering and for what end? * 
2. Suffering not necessarily punishment, for the sake of pun- 
ishment, but a penalty as warning to avoid greater suffering. 
3. Suffering necessary as an economic factor to preserve the 
race. It is a warning of the sentinels of the nervous system to 
the individual of abnormal relations and conditions. Wise men 
sense the warning. 
4. Suffering of mind as well as physical body brings us to 
sense dangerous conditions of life. 
5. Death the great reservoir or clearing house for aches, pains 
and suffering body, and a benign purpose in the mind of our 
great Creator. i 
6. The seed of the future happiness of the race is wrapped up 
in death. 
7. Were it not that man passes away the children of the youth 
would suffer and lack proper care and life would become unbear- 
able. i n

progresses. Excerpt from “ Thanatopsis,” by Bryant. :

PURPOSE OF LIFE 
AVING considered Providence in the Affairs of 
Man, we shall take up for study the great pur- 
pose of life as manifest or indicated in creation. 
Why the creation? What is the underlying purpose? 
As in the seed germ we can see the great possibilities 
of a tree with wide spreading branches, with fruits 
abounding not only for reproduction but for food supply 
for mankind, so in the creation of the world in our 
finite conception we may see the great possibilities of 
life in its harmonious workings. 
Pre-supposing a benign purpose in the creative genius 
of God in all creation, we find ourselves seeking this 
purpose as inherent in all things. “ All things work to- 
gether for good to all who love God, to all who respond 
according to His purpose.” Harmony must be the key- 
note then of all creation if men are to work in accord 
with the purposes of the Creator; not necessarily on the 
plans of individuality as separate from the whole, but 
as the part in conjunction with the whole, to work out 
the highest good for humanity. 
As in the chapters on suffering and death we showed 
how these work in conjunction with life’s purpose for 
good, considering humanity as a whole, so now we must 
try to seek the benign purpose as it operates in the indi- 
vidual life and as related to other individuals. 
Without individuality we can only conceive a vast 
void without form. As one writer has said: “It is 
better to have loved and lost than never to have loved 
at all.” So we must consider that it were better for 
202
-P-A-G-E-203
  
PURPOSE OF LIFE 203 
man to have been born with all possibilities of love and 
affection with the characteristics which go to make up 
individuality than to have never been born at all. 
In the great scheme of life, as it works out and weaves 
into the fabric of character the thread of thought and 
action, producing the finished garment for approval or 
rejection, we stop and ask: “Why this great fact in- 
volving mankind at last to be summoned to judgment 
and final placement? The Sphinx, with its ear open and 
listening for the answer to the question of the ages, asks 
Why? 
Is it for the man’s individual good or only for the 
good of humanity? Again, is it for the good of part of 
mankind, involving the good of all at the expense of 
individuality? The answer must be certainly for the 
good of all which involves the possibility of good for 
each individual, which possibility for good involves a 
chance to be counted among the approved of mankind, 
approved on the ground of character involving the will 
of the individual. Does he wish or aspire to the highest 
good in co-operation with the Creator? 
Reason would suggest that the suwmmum bonum can 
only be thought or worked out in co-operation with the 
plans of the Creator, also that man as a free moral agent 
must come into this harmonious relation if the highest 
good is to be consummated, the highest good for the in- 
dividual, and the whole of humanity. 
In the fabric of life there is evidently a thread out- 
standing which connects with and is woven into every 
other thread. It stands out in the garment as in red 
letters, and spells Responsibility, a long word, but en- 
wrapping a most tremendous meaning for mankind. 
In family relation the parent is responsible for the 
child as long as the child obeys, and the parent is re-
-P-A-G-E-204
  204. THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
quired by all reason to work out for the child the highest 
good. But if the child will not respond or co-operate 
with the parent, it is impossible for the parent to work 
out for the child the highest good; so we may consider 
our relation to our Creator. If we obey and respond 
and co-operate with Him in His evident purpose, He 
necessarily is required and under obligation to work out 
for us the highest good. If we do not obey, it is im- 
possible for Him to work out for us our highest good. 
Mutual responsibility stands. 
As suggested before, the innocent often suffer for the 
guilty, the just for the unjust, the mother for the child, 
and a part of society for.the whole: all for the good of 
the whole. So some compensation for the individual 
must claim our consideration. 
To reconcile conditions as we find them we must pre- 
suppose a continuance of life beyond the earthly exist- . 
ence. The great apostle remarks that “I reckon that the 
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be com- 
pared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.” 
May we not here conclude that man is in a dual state 
of existencée.at the present time—a caterpillar state, so 
to speak, a spiritual body within the fleshly body—the 
former to continue to meet the conditions suggested by 
the great apostle after release from the mortal body. If 
we can thus realize life, the Beatitudes of the Great 
Teacher are apropos: 
“Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the King- 
dom of Heaven.” (Be you ever so lean in spirit in this 
life eternal riches are yours.) 
“Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be com- ~ 
forted.” 
“Blessed are they that have been persecuted for right- 
eousness sake for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.”
-P-A-G-E-205
  PURPOSE OF LIFE 205 
“ Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you and per- 
secute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely 
for my sake—rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is 
your reward in heaven.” 
The great apostle again suggests that if there is no 
resurrection, “then is our preaching vain and our faith 
also vain? If the dead are not raised at all why do we 
also stand in jeopardy every hour?” 
But, as before, within this dual life there is wrapped 
up the promise of a full and complete consummation in 
the highest good, which can only come to those who re- 
spond according to the purposes of the Creator. As 
reason would suggest: “He that willeth,” “responds to 
do His will,” shall know whether these things are pos- 
sible and can become a reality. 
But how reach this life condition providing for the 
summum bonum? The writer’s answer would be in the 
formula of the Great Teacher: “ That they may know 
thee” (the goodness of God ‘and loving-kindness in al- 
truistic service). 
This is the highest purpose and end of life that we 
may comeé into a sympathetic relationship to our Creator 
so that we niay know His character and the evident~ 
spirit of the Great Teacher as He went. about doing good 
(loving-kindness and ‘altruistic service). This means 
', good-will among men and sympathetic relationship to the 
Creator of us all. 
Underlying the whole scheme of ‘creation and civiliz- 
ing processes of man, the prime purpose appears to be 
to bring man into a sympathetic relation to the Creator 
in character and into good fellowship with one another. 
With this purpose very evident, the teachings of the 
Great Teacher are apropos, as He would impress the 
race with the spirit of loving-kindness. In one place
-P-A-G-E-206
206 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
He says: “ Where two or three are met together there 
am I (loving-kindness) in the midst.” In the market- 
place, in the mines and factory, in the counting-house 
and schools, in politics and religious congregations where 
the spirit of courtesy and good-will is manifest there the 
dove of peace rests. The kind courtesies of life as they 
are exchanged in greetings, the giving a cup of cold 
water, the ministration to the sick and sympathetic touch, 
all manifestations of the higher aspiration, give promise 
of a character prepared for the consummation in the life 
eternal. 
As the blossom of the fruit tree in its beauty and at- 
tractiveness is to the fruit, so is this life to the character 
to be evolved. The blossom is only the evidence and has 
possibilities of the fruit, and not the fruit itself. If we 
care for the deeper life of the pistle the fruit evolves 
most naturally, so man if he responds to the larger’ pur- 
poses of life and cultivates a sympathetic knowledge of 
God and moves with altruistic purpose, manifesting the 
spirit of loving-kindness, he evolves the summum bonum 
or highést good for the individual and humanity.

And the voice-call in the waters flow— 
Some time at eve when the tide is low,

Some friendly barks that were anchored near, 
Some loving souls that my heart held dear; 
In silent sorrow will drop a tear, 
But I shall have peacefully furled my sail 
In moorings sheltered from storm and gale, 
And greeted the friends who have sailed before,

LIFE AND LIGHT 
HIS gift of God to man and marking the crown- 
| ing of His creation, may be considered the 
greatest contribution to mankind showing the 
goodness of God. 
Some man will say that life to some is a burden, to 
others a questionable reality. But to most of mankind it 
is a gift to be valued and prized above all others. 
Under other chapters we have shown how death and 
suffering were manifestations of the goodness of God, 
so we may reasonably show how life in its many phases 
may be considered good. 
When we enter upon the discussion of this question 
we must assume the normal, physical, mental and spir- 
itual life of man as observed by our experiences and ob- 
servations in life. The Great Teacher said “all things 
work together for good,” and when God created man He 
pronounced His creation “very good.” Life, suffering, 
death, with their unending influences upon the other 
creations and relations, may mark a point in creation 
called Good. 
We may speak of life and consider it in its relations 
to other creations, its adaptations to the world activities, 
and its functions in the great scheme of God’s creation. 
The normal life may be that of man bound up within 
the three score years and ten, including the physical, 
mental and spiritual activities attending such life. When 
we consider what the universe would be without man to 
208
-P-A-G-E-209
  
LIFE AND LIGHT 209 
‘appreciate it, to co-operate with the great forces mov- 
ing within and about this creation and to function in a 
manner to work out the great purpose of the Creator, 
we would say with the Biblical writer: “ Without form 
-and void ;” nothing to be seen, handled or known, simply 
“void.” Can you grasp the meaning of this word? 
But the giver of every good and perfect gift places 
life above all other phases of existence, and pronounces 
the penalty of violation of law directly against it. In the 
day thou eatest thereof (violate my law) thou shalt 
surely forfeit this gift, life, with all its possibilities. 
_ Death begins in suffering which is the first noticeable 
penalty of violated law, and continues through the physi- 
cal life. The possibilities of life, as differentiated from 
actual physical life, constitute or comprise the full de- 
velopment of mental and spiritual life which would 
naturally grow out of obedience and faithful observance 
of law. 
Although we may suffer in the physical body, yet the 
great possibilities of life in mental and spiritual values 
are vouchsafed to all who will co-operate in accord with 
His purpose. These may so far outweigh the physical 
sufferings that we may say with the Biblical writer: 
“That they are not worthy to be compared with the 
glory that shall be revealed in us.” 
We may look upon life as a great opportunity and as 
Shakespeare phrases it: “There is a tide in the affairs 
of men which taken at its flood leads on to fortune, but 
omitted the balance of life may be spent in shallows and 
in miseries.” As an opportunity we may consider it a 
gift for infinite development. 
In considering life in its relation to other creations we 
would consider it in its adaptations to the world activi- 
ties and requirements as they revolve around us day by  
-P-A-G-E-210
  210 THE GENERAL*PURPOSE OF LIFE 
day, and in which we are required by physical, mental 
and spiritual construction to function in accordance with 
these other creations. 
We cannot get away from them, nor do we so desire 
under normal relationships. The normal life is so 
adapted in family relations, in mental and moral qualifi- 
cations and relationships, that we would naturally say: 
“Tt is good to be here, functioning in all these rela- 
tions.” 
It appears that God has honoured man above all other 
creations in making him a co-worker in development of 
the world. In the physical creations, the sun, moon, 
stars and earth, as they came from the hand of God, we 
can see no marks of man’s hand. But as we look further 
into the great scheme of creation and see the works of 
man, how he co-operates with the Creator through the 
laws of chemistry, physics, mathematics and other laws, 
we marvel at his genius. We see it in the wonderful 
development in our cities, ocean steamers, transportation 
systems by land, sea and air, the wonderful help of 
man in repairing the broken and maimed of mankind; 
the development in the agricultural, mechanical, indus- 
trial and commercial world; the advance in all electrical 
appliances, surgical helps, his works of art and all lines 
of communication and in every definite purpose for 
good. All these are working together for good. At 
times this silver lining may not be in view, but if we 
could lift the veil we could see the altruistic Divine pur- 
pose throughout. 
We can then see that life is one great opportunity and 
privilege for development and co-operation with the 
Creator in working out the summum bonum, the highest 
good for mankind for all who respond according to His 
purpose and co-operate with God.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
LIFE AND LIGHT 211 
In considering the goodness of God to mankind we 
must note the great facts of light and heat. These two 
phases of the Creator’s great provision for mankind are 
closely related and interwoven into the great scheme 
looking to man’s comfort and are as one with life. 
In the study of the principles or elements of physics 
we find light closely related to electricity as well as heat, 
since electrical currents in certain relations produce light 
and heat. But, like electricity, we can see the effects 
but cannot describe its constituent parts. We have 
learned, however, that certain light waves travel at a rate 
of 186,000 miles per second, and that there are lights 
within the universe, stars and solar systems,. whose lights 
are observed only by the use of telescope, spectroscope, 
photography and selenium-cell. 
The Biblical writer says that two great lights were 
created: the greater, sun, to rule by day and the lesser, 
moon, to rule by night. These are the phenomena which 
we must now consider. 
How does light contribute to the welfare of mankind? 
What is its purpose, and how related to man’s life? 
We may say that light is the compiement of sight, as 
there could be no sight without light waves from which 
the eye receives the impression of objects seen. Having 
created the heavens, the earth and the great lights to rule, 
the creation of the sense of sight must necessarily follow 
in order that man could see the wonderful creations and 
be guided by these lights in all his activities. As all 
creation without mind would be practically void, so with- 
out light and ability to appreciate it the sense of vision 
would become void, so to speak. In the dark waters of 
Mammoth Cave, hidden far away from the light of day, 
the fish in these waters have no vision or sight, the eyes 
having become sightless, void or atrophied because of 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
non-use. There is no light to bring into activity the 
powers of the eye, so, having existed in this condition 
for a long period of time, the powers are gone and only 
form is left to mark the place. The eye is without the 
vision or sight. 
Not only is light the medium through which the vision 
functions and thereby aids man in all his movements and 
activities, but it carries with itself a healing power, a 
salutary influence contributing to the general health of 
mankind. Light and heat may function together in this 
respect. The light and heat of the flame, playing upon 
many hidden bacilli or germ-life, remove their deadly 
effects or so subdue their power of infection that im- 
munity follows. 
The various kinds of light, as sunlight and the various 
kinds of artificial light, gas, electricity and candle-power, 
all have led the way of man through the darkness in the 
ages past. But man has always needed the light of the 
“sun in order to preserve sight and cause the sense of 
vision to function in all its fine adaptations to man’s 
needs. 
Light is so necessary to the well-being of man that 
it has been for ages the synonym for life. Confucius 
was called the Light of Asia. One of the Biblical writ- 
ers says in speaking of the Great Teacher: “In him 
was life and the life was the light of man—the light 
shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it 
not.” And when he spoke of God he said: “ Every 
good and perfect gift comes down from the Father of 
Lights, and in him is no darkness at all.” It would ap- 
pear therefore that light is so closely associated with the 
welfare of mankind that it is considered as one with 
his life. Without life there would be no appreciation of 
light, and without light the life of man would be im-
-P-A-G-E-213
  LIFE AND LIGHT 213 
measurably dwarfed and his power for usefulness made 
almost nil. 
How beautiful and how exhilarating the light of day 
as Old Sol climbs the eastern horizon and leads one to 
exclaim with the Psalmist: “The heavens declare the 
glory (goodness) of God and the firmament showeth his 
handiwork. Day unto day uttereth speech and night 
unto night showeth knowledge. In them hath he set a 
tabernacle for the sun which is as bridegroom coming 
out of his chamber; there is no speech or language where 
their voice is not heard; their line is gone out through 
all the earth and their circuit unto the ends of it, and 
there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.” 
Considering light from the standpoint of utility, we 
see that all vegetation is stimulated by the light of the 
sun, and without it all life would wither and die. And 
by a lessening of it our food supply would be cut short 
and provision for man’s nourishment would fail. But all 
things must work together for good. As the other be- 
nign laws furnish rain, chemical compounds and other 
nourishing supplies, so the sun must exert the full power 
of its quota in nourishing rays of light and heat to meet 
the necessary conditions of supply and demand in har- 
mony with His other creations. 
This charm of light is exhilarating to the nervous sys- 
tem, cleansing the atmosphere, weaving into the vision 
of man and beast colours innumerable yet symmetrical 
and harmonious, pleasing to the eye and attractive to the 
point of wonder. Through light the masterpieces of pig- 
ment in form of picture, landscape, form and motion- 
picture, are wrought out showing the benign purpose of 
the Creator. We also see His goodness in the social, re- 
ligious, industrial and commercial world through the
-P-A-G-E-214
  
$14 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
wonderful lights created at His command. He said: 
“Let there be light,” and there was light. 
“We have spoken of lights which we see and the 
X-rays to be seen only under cover of darkness and 
which pass through flesh and stone. But between the 
X-rays and the clear light of day there are many kinds 
and shades of light invisible. These waves, too short to 
affect the eye, can affect the photographic plate, and we 
can discover in this way the existence of waves only 
half the length of the deep violet waves.” So we have 
lights visible and invisible, so to speak. But in the other 
direction we can detect waves of ether longer than the 
light-waves called the electro-magnetic waves. These 
waves, such as light, radiant-heat, and electro-magnetic 
waves, differ only as regards to their length. The power 
of the eye to see is dependent, evidently, upon the wave 
motion of the ether, conveying the light. 
“Everything in the visible universe is transmitted to 
us wholly by light-waves arising from the very rapid 
motions of the inconceivably small particles or electric 
charges, called electrons, that form essential parts of the 
atoms or molecules of which all matter is composed, and 
made known through chemistry and photography. 
“Distances expressed in hundreds and thousands of 
light-years are measured through the effects produced by 
light whose waves are so short that there are about 50,000 
to the linear inch. In addition to the visible radiations, 
the atoms emit the much shorter waves corresponding to 
X-rays and also longer ones called heat waves. Electric 
waves are of similar nature, but are caused by the oscil- 
lations of electric charges in bodies larger than atoms, 
All these waves travel with the same velocity, 186,300 
miles per second. 
“The unit employed in measuring light waves in the

meter (0.000.000.004 inch). The instruments and 
methods are so accurate that results correct to less 
than a hundredth of an Angstrom are obtained.”—As- 
tronomical Society of the Pacific. 
As before suggested: 
Light has a wonderful influence upon plant life as well 
as upon animal life. The plant sends out its shoots 
which bend toward the light. And the leaves spread out 
and twist around to catch the rays of the sun. Thomson 
says that “Light interferes with the action of gravity 
on the stem and is the primary cause of leaf movement.” 
“The leaf is formed wide and flat as a rule, with ex- 
posure of surface to the light as large as possible, and 
in colour (green) and in place to absorb or drink in the 
carbon dioxide, the nourishing food of the plant, from 
the air.” Vegetable life is the great transformer and 
prepares the foods for animal life. 
The leaves, the lungs of the plant, are unable to with- 
stand the frosts of winter, but the seed containing the 
life germ is built and protected even when dried up so 
that its vital activities are reduced to a minimum, and 
with its close, protected coat can resist the coldest tem- 
perature of the winter. It can withstand heat also, and 
its life is preserved through decades. 
It is said that the power of man to produce light is 
an index of his progress in ascent from the lower to the 
higher. As Sir William Crooks says: “ From the primi- 
tive torch to the paraffine candle, how wide an interval 
between them, how vast a contrast. The means adopted 
by man to illuminate his home at night stamps at once 
his position in the scale of civilization. The fluid bitu- 
men of the far east, the Etruscan lamp; the whale, seal 
or bear fat filling the hut of the Eskimo or Lapp with
-P-A-G-E-216
  216 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
odour rather than light; the huge wax candle on the glit- 
tering altar, the range of gas lamps on our streets, all 
have their stories to tell. All, if they could speak, might 
warm our hearts in telling how they have ministered to 
man’s comfort, love of home, toil and devotion.” These 
may be mentioned also as in contrast with the modern 
incandescent lamp and the electric-lighting systems. 
The poet says and sings: 
The night has a thousand eyes, 
And the day but one; 
Yet the light of the bright world dies, 
With the dying sun. 
The mind has a thousand eyes, 
And the heart but one; 
Yet the light of a whole life dies, 
When love is done. 
Francis W. BourpiLion. 
TOPICAL SUGGESTIONS: 
1. The normal, physical, mental and spiritual life of man as 
seen within the three score and ten years. 
2. Life a great opportunity. Suffering may be a guide. 
3. Our great Creator honours man in making him a co-worker 
in developing the world. The earth and solar systems show no 
marks of man’s hand, but the vegetable kingdom and the won- 
derful achievements in the industrial world show co-operation. 
4. Light and heat. Light the complement of sight. All a void 
without light. f 
5. Light not only a purifier of the atmosphere but gives color 
which delights the eyes. 
6. The utilities of light. 
7. The exhilarating effects of light. 
8. Harmonies of nature observed through light.

THE ELEMENTS 
es elements, commonly known by the ancients 
as earth, air, fire and water, but scientists would 
probably add another to this list called ether 
which pervades all the elements and saturates all life or 
known existence, conveying light to the eye. 
Under Geology we have treated in a small way the 
strata of the earth, so we will pass on to the next ele- 
ment called Air. This element, treated chemically, will 
show the formula Oxygen and Nitrogen, with a small 
mixture of carbon dioxide. 
Air appears to be the substance above all others neces- 
sary at all times to keep man and beast alive, so im- 
portant is this to our very lives that God in His good- 
ness has provided it without stint, and, like the rain, is 
enjoyed by the just and unjust alike. It does not re- 
quire any argument to show that in this element, air, 
there is a constant reminder that life is hanging, as it 
were, upon a slender thread. Air through the lungs in 
moving, never-ending process of absorption and assimila- 
tion and expulsion receiving and absorbing the oxygen, 
nitrogen, casting out the carbon dioxide contributes to 
the physical body the necessary particles to enrich the 
blood and preserve life. Man scarcely begins to live be- 
fore he begins to breathe, and must continue to function, 
using the air as a means of preserving life. 
It is also the vehicle of sound to the ear without which 
217,  
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
this kind censor could not function. The wave motion 
is long and very slow in comparison with the wave 
motion of the ether which conveys light. Light travels 
at the rate of 186,000 miles per second, while sound 
travels 1,000 feet per second. 
The receptacles of the ear are finely adjusted to the 
density and wave motions of the atmosphere and sound, 
while the delicate organs of vision or sight are just as 
finely adjusted to the medium, ether which conveys the 
wave motions of light to the eye. 
So in all our relations of life air is the medium con- 
veying the healing and life-giving stream of life to the 
lungs, both when asleep and awake, acting automatically 
by pressure to suit the delicate organs. So in the pleas- 
ures of life, as the sense of hearing functions in music, 
song or thunder warnings, air is the great outstanding 
vehicle contributing to the welfare of mankind. 
Then Fire, another of these wonderful gifts to man, 
finds a large place in man’s life. It may be found in the 
field of chemistry, marking the combustion of gases as 
they play upon each other in the experimental laboratory 
or in the home in domestic life as food is prepared in 
the kitchen; in the mill or foundry where the liquid 
metals are poured and moulded and pressed into form, 
or in the incinerator where the refuse of cities and towns 
reach their final quietus through fire; or under the boiler 
to produce steam for running machinery of mill and fac- 
tory, or in the illuminations of town or city, this great 
gift to man is always ready as a handmaid and helper 
to man. It is so useful, yet so deadly in its functioning, 
that colour, the red signal of danger, always marks its 
approach. 
With the coming of electricity as a great factor in the 
affairs of man, and in the generating of this power, we 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  
THE ELEMENTS 219 
find fire as a factor in producing the steam to operate 
the machinery where such power is needed. In the coal 
fields and industrial sections, in the lumber camps and 
forest, in the great cities in their lighting and power sys- 
tems, in our railroad and transportation systems by land 
and sea, the use of electricity generated by fire brings 
man face to face with nature’s wonders, and one would 
say with the Hebrew writer: 
“Wonderful are thy works, oh Lord, and thy ways 
past finding out.” 
Then we must consider water as another element con- 
tributing to the welfare of man. 
The chemical formula H,O is the most common, aside 
from air and ether, in its proximity and use. It is so 
common that two-thirds of the earth’s surface is covered 
with water, river, lake, sea and ocean; the waters bear 
the commerce of the world and furnish the means by 
which man can circumnavigate the earth. It is so com- 
mon that we scarcely appreciate its contribution to our 
immediate welfare. Without water the great western 
hemisphere might have remained undiscovered to this 
day. With the discovery of steam a new civilization was 
projected. The application of the power of steam or the 
expansive power of water gave a new impetus to the 
machinery of to-day, which may be considered man’s 
handmaid and industrial helpmeet in all its relations, as- 
sisting in practically all of man’s appliances of a mechan- 
ical nature. 
In domestic life it is of course indispensable. In 
preparation of food, in sanitation and purification, in 
medicinal and surgical applications, in flushing not only 
the sewers of the city, but the sewerage system of the 
physical body, as well as cleansing the outward body. 
In all these relations, adaptations and purposes, in the
-P-A-G-E-220
    220 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
use of water the goodness of God is manifest. But we 
may show you yet other ways, in vegetable and animal 
life. In the rainfall and dewdrop to soften the soil in 
agriculture we see that water contributes, not only to his 
welfare but is absolutely necessary to man’s existence. 
As the elements above mentioned are so intimately 
connected with our lives and are found so necessary to 
our existence, may we not yet find, as we look into the 
Creator’s great works, a more wonderful contribution to 
man’s welfare in the unseen, yet penetrating power called 
ether? 
As ether is the vehicle by which light travels and 
reaches the human eye, may we not reason that the great 
universe is a vast unfathomable ocean of ethereal life, 
as yet little understood by mankind? 
As there are many stars, suns and systems whose 
light has yet to strike our vision and press their influ- 
ences upon our planet, may we not reasonably imagine 
that the benign influences yet to penetrate the mist and 
spread the light, may so quicken our mental and spiritual 
perceptions that we shall see more clearly the benign 
hand of God in all creation? 
As the Psalmist suggests: “The heavens declare the 
glory (goodness) of God, and the firmament showeth his 
handiwork, day unto day uttereth speech and night unto 
night showeth knowledge, there is no speech nor lan- 
guage where their voice is not heard.” 
This would indicate that God is appealing to man and 
teaching us through the wonderful creations and their 
benign influences trying to show us His wonderful good- 
ness. When the light and influences of these far-away 
spheres reach us, may not their appeal be irresistible? 
The closing verse of the 107th Psalm says: “ Whoso is 
wise and will observe these things even they shall know
-P-A-G-E-221
THE ELEMENTS 221 
of the loving-kindness of God!” When the loving- 
kindness of God, manifest every day in all creation, is 
thoroughly comprehended by man, the appeal will cer- 
tainly be irresistible. 
The unfathomable universe is one vast and tremen- 
dous appeal to man to understand His loving-kindness. 
As light and heat cause molecular movements in mat- 
ter, and as the mind and body of man are subject to these 
influences as indicated by the shades of the colour of 
face when in a rage or under the joyous spell of good- 
fellowship, white or red in anger, glowing with kindness 
in good-fellowship ; in fear a pale and frightened appear- 
ance; in joy a clean healthy glow; in worry a languid, 
sallow face; in happy mind a ruddy, cheerful counte- 
nance. In fact, there may yet be developed a chemistry 
of character which may show the character by the colour 
of face, brightness of the eye, the clearness of vision, 
and the many other marks of face and life indicative of 
life and character. 
As we study these things under the light of truth we 
can see that the Great Teacher’s warnings were apropos: 
Do not worry, do not fear, do not hate, all of these 
poison the body, system and constitution of man, pro- 
ducing a chemical change in the blood and body, causing 
a poison to permeate the life and make it difficult to 
function. Fear will cause the hair to turn gray in a 
night; worry upsets the stomach and whole nervous sys- 
tem; hate poisons the mind and body. 
An illustration may be apropos; the following story 
came to the writer sometime ago: A young lady, very 
nervous and with unhappy state of mind, visited many 
physicians for relief. But none could help her, until 
finally she visited one who questioned her in regard to 
her disposition and relationships. Among other ques-
-P-A-G-E-222
222 THE GENERAL PURPOSE OF LIFE 
tions he asked: “Do you hate anybody?” Her answer 
was: “Yes, I hate my sister with the most bitter hatred.” 
The physician then advised her to go and become recon- 
ciled to her sister, then come back and talk with him. 
The lady decided to take the advice of the kind physi- 
cian, became reconciled to her sister and again learned 
to love her. Her health returned and she found other 
treatment unnecessary. 
In life and under the influences of light divine we 
can understand although we may not yet comprehend 
that “all things work together for good” to all who re- 
spond according to His purpose. 
At the entrance to the harbour of New York there 
stands the great Statue of Liberty enlightening the 
world, holding up the torch or light as symbolical of 
liberty, truth and enlightenment, which are among the 
higher ideals of Americanism. 
Ether is considered one of the fundamental entities 
of the universe. There is no such thing as empty space. 
Ether pervades every particle of matter and animal life. 
With matter and energy it may constitute an essential 
oneness of the universe, yet operating or functioning 
through matter, mind and spirit. ‘‘ Nature abhors a 
vacuum.” That is unless Einstein’s theory should be 
proven correct and true. 
Thomson says: “ The invisible medium through which 
the waves of light travel is the ether, and this ether 
permeates all space and all matter. Between us and 
the stars stretch vast regions, empty of all matter. But 
we see the stars; their light reaches us even though it 
may take centuries to do so. We conceive then that it 
is the universal ether which conveys the light. All the 
energy which has reached the earth from the sun, and 
which stored for ages in our coal fields, is now used to
-P-A-G-E-223
THE ELEMENTS 223 
propel our trains and steamships, to heat and light our 
cities, and to perform all the multifarious tasks of 
modern life, was conveyed by ether. Without that uni- 
versal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a 
stagnant, lifeless world.” 
“Nature divides living beings into those who are ar- 
riving and those who are departing. Those who are de- 
parting are turned towards the shadows; those who are 
arriving towards the light. The tread at first insensible, 
increases slowly like all separation of branches—the 
boughs without becoming detached from the trunk grow 
away from it. It is no fault of theirs. Young people 
feel the cooling off of life. Old people that of the 
tomb.”—Huco. 
“Happiness desires that all the world should be 
happy.”

LAW OF RIGHT RELATIONS 
i HE law of the highest spiritual life was laid 
I down by the Great Teacher when He said, in 
answer to the question of the lawyer on a cer- 
tain occasion, “ Which is the great commandment?” 
“Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,” etc., and the 
second is like into it, “ Thou shalt love thy neighbour,” 
etc. “On these two commandments hang all the law 
and the prophets.” Therefore these two commandments 
embrace the constitution. 
This same constitution was proclaimed when Jesus 
was born, “glory (honour) to God and good-will among 
men.”, 
Men honour God because He is good. 
Men love their neighbour because of the same spirit 
within. 
The same constitution was proclaimed by Moses in the 
ten commandments. First to fourth commandments, 
honour and duties to God. Fifth to tenth command- 
ments, honour and duties to men, 
The same constitution or basis of right relations was 
recognized by George Washington when he took the 
oath of office in founding the Republic. He placed his 
hand upon the Scripture passage, Micah 6th chapter and 
8th verse. 
Warren G. Harding, when he took the oath of office, 
in the new order looking to a permanent peace of the 
world, placed his hand upon the same Scripture passage, 258 :
-P-A-G-E-254
  254 PSYCHOLOGY OF “THE FOURTH ‘R’” 
Micah 6th chapter and 8th verse, “ What doth the Lord 
require of thee, but to do justly and to love mercy, and 
walk humbly with thy God?” 
In Abraham Lincoln’s second Inaugural Address yout 
will find that he was moved by this same fundamental 
law when he uttered those memorable words, “ With 
malice towards none and charity for all, with firmness 
in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive _ 
on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s : 
wounds,” etc. In his last public address he said, “ He 
from whom all blessings flow must not be forgotten. A 
call forsa national thanksgiving is being prepared.” 
How car the ability to observe this Constitution be= 
come a part of man’s power? The answer is by coming 
into- the spirit of His loving-kindness through apprecia- 
tion. of ‘the goodness of God. 
His name was called Jesus because He would save the 
‘people from their sins. That is, the name Jesus typifted 
‘s. the spirit of Jesus, as when Jacob was calted Israel be- 
cause he prevailed with God; as Simon, the son of Jonas, 
was called Peter on account of his change in chgracter. 
Abram’s name was changed to Abraham, “For a father 
_of many nations have I made thee.” 
Now, the Spirit of Jesus, revealing God’s loving: -kind- 
ness, as He went about doing good, when understood 
by men will change the spirit of men so that théy will 
desire to function in that same ae spiritual atmosphere, Le 
said: 
= “I if I ‘anti, spttit) ‘be lifted up. (made: prominent) 
will draw, all fhen ungo"me.” Poe 
Tf His loving- -kindneds be shown it will draw all ‘men. 
(See illustration-story of Jim, under Altruism:)

acteristic. As the man was called Adam because he was 
from the ground or earth, the woman was called Eve 
because she was the mother of all living. And down 
‘through Bible history you may find the name signifying 
either character or mark. 
In the temple, Peter, in his sermon, said, “ There is 
no other name under heaven given among men whereby 
we must be saved.” He certainly meant there was no 
other spirit. The spirit of hate, jealousy, greed, lust, 
and every other spirit, except the spirit of loving-kind- 
ness fails. 
If we honour God for His goodness we shall become 
ymore like Him in character or spirit, as Earnest in. the”

“The Great Teacher gave a picture of the final aides 
ment, and to’ those who had no mark or creed He safd, 
“T wag hungry and ye fed me; 1 was thirsty and ye gave 
me drink; I was naked and ye clothed me; I was sick #. a

He said, “Inasmuch as ye did it nto one of these ye

ness—“sDeal justly, love mercy and Walk humbly before 
thy God. 2 cP his is spiritual life wherever found. 
Note, the 19th Psalm—* The heavens declare the glory, 
( goodness) of God; and the firthament showeth His 
handiwork,” ,etc. Then it says, “ The law (leving-kind- 
ness) of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” The: 
same Jaw is manifest in the two trite and familiar lines: a 
rae
-P-A-G-E-256

which follow (note the simplicity of the appeal, yet the 
universal law) : 
“What makes the lamb love Mary so, the eager children cry? 
Oh, Mary loves the lamb you know, the teacher did reply.” 
The Psalmist says in the 107th Psalm, “Oh that men 
would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his won- 
derful works to the children of men.” Then he repeats 
again and again, and in the last verse he says, “ Whoso 
is wise and will observe these things even they shall 
know of the loving-kindness of God.” 
Is. the psychology of this 107th Psalm scientifically 
sound? The writer thinks it will bear the scrutiny of 
scientific investigation, that the challenge of this Psalm 
can be met. and worked out in personal experience, and 
that it will function in life in expressions of thanksgiv- 
ing and good-will. 
Admitting this, we have a spiritual law functioning 
through a natural law. (law of psychology) which may 
be termed a spiritual law in the natural world, as a con- 
necting link between God and man, producing the highest 
spiritual life, 
This law was mentioned by St. Paul when he said, 
“Other foundation can no man lay than that which is 
laid” (loving-kindness, personified in Jesus). This law 
also functions through a natural law, in the plan of 
propagation as suggested by the Great Teacher when He 
said, “ Ye must be born again.” The spirit of loving- 
kindness under this plan vitalizes the spirit of man, giv- 
ing life: as the egg is vitalized and fertilized by contact. 
The spirit of loving-kindness functions in life when we, 
having appreciated the goodness of God, are imbued with 
that same: spirit and transmit it to others through altru- 
istic. service,—as when the Great Teacher said, “Let
-P-A-G-E-257
  LAW OF RIGHT RELATIONS 257 
your light shine before men that they may see your good 
works and glorify (love) your Father.” “As God allows 
his light (sun) to shine that we may see his good works,” 
and imbibe His spirit through appreciation of His 
goodness, 
Altruistic service vitalizes the spirit of men every- 
where, as seen in the spirit of men, women and children 
in southeastern Europe, Belgium and other countries, by 
the service rendered by one of our great and foremost 
citizens. His outstanding altruistic service has affected 
the children of those countries so that in their prayers 
morning and evening they lift their hearts in thanksgiv- 
ing and gratitude for His kindness. 
The result of altruistic service is seen in the friendly 
attitude of China to America as a result of the generous 
spirit manifested by our country in the negotiations 
growing out of the Boxer rebellion. 
“The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest 
the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh 
or whither it goeth. So is everyone who is born (vital- 
ized) of the Spirit.” He goes about doing good, vital- 
izing and pollenizing, as the wind vitalizes and pollenizes 
the blossoms of the trees and grain fields. Men are born 
again by this pollenizing process by receiving His loving- 
kindness, who in turn function in altruistic service. The 
parable of the leaven is apropos here. 
“Tn the great struggle of Jean Valjean, before men- 
tioned in the chapter under Mind, Victor Hugo says 
“there are two things in which I have not succeeded—in 
breaking the thread which holds me, fixed, riveted and 
sealed here by my heart (referring to conscience) or in 
silencing some one who speaks softly to me when alone” 
(lonely). *

Story or Hawruorne’s Great STONE FACE 
As the writer believes in the psychology or law of at- 
traction depicted by Hawthorne in the “Great Stone 
Face,” that it is as true as the law of gravitation and 
the law of reproduction, the story is given in brief that 
the law may be seen in its operation upon character. 
The scenery is pictured as a lofty mountain, with a 
beautiful valley below. The foothills are lined here with 
huts or smaller houses, and there with larger and more 
pretentious dwellings, with a settlement of several thou- 
sand people in the valley. 
The mountainside is steep and difficult. It seemed as 
if a great giant had sculptured out his own likeness on 
the precipice. There was the broad arched forehead a 
hundred feet in height; the nose with its long ridge, the 
vast lips which, if they could speak, would roll forth 
thunderous accents from one end of the valley to the 
other. 
At close range it looked like a chaotic lot of gigantic 
rocks piled up. Retracing your steps, the wondrous 
features would again be seen, and the farther we with- 
draw the more like a human face with divinity intact 
would appear, until it grew dim in the distance with the 
clouds and glorified vapour of the mountains clustering 
around it. The Great Stone Face seemed positively 
alive. 
“Tt was a happy lot of children to grow up to man- 
hood and womanhood with the Great Stone Face before 
their eyes, for all the features were noble and the expres- 
sion at once grand and sweet, as if it were the glow of 
the vast warm heart, that embraced all mankind in af- 
fection and had room for more.” 
Tt was an education only to look at it. 
According to belief, the valley owed much of its fer-
-P-A-G-E-259
LAW OF RIGHT RELATIONS 259 
tility to this benign aspect that was continuously beam- 
ing over it, illuminating the clouds, and with great ten- 
derness. 
“* Mother,’ said Earnest, as the great face smiled 
upon him, ‘I wish it could speak, for it looks so very 
kindly that its voice must be pleasant.’ 
“ When the toil of day was over, Earnest would gaze 
at the Great Stone Face for hours. 
“There was a prophecy that a man would some day 
come to the village. with a character and benign expres- 
sion depicted in the Great Stone Face. 
“Gathergold came and many thought he was the man, 
as he built a great palace, and was very rich, but Earnest 
soon learned that he was not the man. 
“Then Old Blood and Thunder came with sword and 
flashing epaulets and embroidered collar. But he was 
not the man. 
“Then Old Stony Phiz, the statesman, came but he 
was not the man. 
“Then a poet came, and he was not the man. 
“Finally the poet points out Earnest as the man. He 
had taken on the character of the Great Stone Face.”

Cheeriest room that morn the kitchen, 
Helped by Bridget’s willing hands, 
Bustled Hannah deftly making pies, 
For ready waiting pans ; ood 
Little Flossie flitted ’round them 
And her curling, floating hair 
Glinted gold-like, gleamed and glistened 
In the summer sunlit air. 
Slouched a figure o’er the lawn, 
A man so haggard and forlorn, 
Tattered, grim, so like a beggar 
N’er had trod that path before. 
His hat was gone, his pants were torn, 
Bare and begrimed his knees, 
Face with blood and dirt disfigured, 
' Elbows peeped from out his sleeves; 
Rat, tat, tat, upon the entrance 
Brought Aunt Hannah to the door, 
Parched lips humbly plead for water 
As she scanned his misery o’er. 
“Drink, you’ve had enough, you rascal ; 
Faugh, the smell now makes me sick; 
Move, you thief, leave now these grounds, 
Sir, or our dogs will help you quick.”

  Then the man with dragging footsteps, 
Hopeless, wishing himself dead, 
Crept away from sight of plenty, 
Starved instead of being fed. 
Wandered farther from the mansion 
Till he reached a purling brook 
Babbling, trilling, broken music 
*Mid a quaint and shady nook. 
Here sweet Flossie found him fainting, 
In her hands were food and drink. 
“Ts it ’cause my auntie grieved you?” 
Quickly did the wee one ask. 
“Tl tell you a little verse then, 
*Tis a Holy Bible task. 
‘Love your enemies, and those 
Who despitefully use you, 
Love them whether friend or foes.’” 
Then the rags from off his forehead 
She with dainty hands offstript, 
In the brooklet’s rippling water 
Her own lace-trimmed ’kerchief dipped. 
Wrung she then the linen cleanly, 
Bandaged up the wound again, 
Ere the still eyes opened slowly, 
White lips murmuring, “Am I sane?” 
“Look, poor man, here’s food and drink. 
Now thank our God before you take.” 
Then she flitted from his vision, 
Left him prostrate on the ground 
Conning o’er and o’er that lesson 
With a grace to him new found. 
That “Our God” unsealed a fountain 
His whole life had never known,

When that human angel near him 
Spoke of her God as his own. 
Sunlight filtering through green branches 
As they wind, wave, dance and dip, 
Finds a prayer his mother taught him 
Trembling on his crime-stained lip. 
Hist, a step, an angry mutter, 
And the owner of the place, 
Gentle Flossie’s haughty father, 
And the tramp stood face to face. 
“Thieving rascal, you've my daughter’s 
’Kerchief bound upon your brow, 
Off with it, cast it down here, 
Come, be quick about it now.” 
As the man did not obey him, 
Flossie’s father lashed his cheek 
With a riding whip he carried, 
Struck him hard and cut him deep. 
Quick the tramp bore down upon him, 
Felled him, o’er him where he lay, 
Raised a knife to seek his life-blood, 
Then there came a thought to stay. 
All his angry, murderous impulse 
Caused the knife to shuddering fall, 
“He’s her father, ‘love your enemies, 
’Tis our God reigns over all.’” 
At midnight lambent, lurid flames, 
Light up the sky with fiercest beams, 
Wild cries, Fire! Fire! ring through the air 
And red like blood each flame now seems. 
They higher grow, they wilder throw weird, 
Direful arms which ever lean 
Against the gray stone mansion old.

Deep silence falls on all around, 
At top-most window from the ground 
Sweet Flossie stands, her curling hair 
Encircled now by fire-lit air. 
Loud rang the father’s cry, “Oh God, 
My child, my child! Will no one dare 
For her sweet sake to climb the flaming stair?” 
Look, one steps forth with muffled face, 
On trembling ladder runs a race 
With life and death, the window gains; 
The ladder falls with crashing sound, 
A flaming, treacherous mass—Oh God, 
She was so young and he so brave, 
Look once again, on highest roof he stands, 
His arms enclasp the child, 
God help him yet to save. 
“For life or for eternal sleep,” 
He cried, then made a vaulting leap. 
A tree branch catches with sure aim, 
And by the act proclaims his name. 
The air was rent, the cheers rang loud, 
A rough voice cries from out the crowd, 
“Huzza, my boys, well we know him, 
None dares that leap but Flying Jim,” 
A jail bird, outlaw, thief indeed, 
Yet o’er them all takes kingly lead. 
“Do now your worst,” his gasping cry, 
“Do now your worst, I’m doomed to die, 
I’ve breathed the flame, ’twill not be long,” 
Then hushed all murmurs through the throng. 
With reverend hands they bore him where 
The summer evening’s cooling air 
Came gently sighing through the trees, 
The child’s proud father on his knees 263
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 PSYCHOLOGY OF “THE FOURTH ‘R’” 
Forgiveness sought of God and Jim, 
Which dying lips accorded him. 
“T would her hands might touch my face, 
Though she’s so pure and I’m so base.” 
Low Flossie bent and kissed the brow, 
With smile of bliss transfigured now. 
Death, the Angel, sealed it there, 
’Twas sent to God with mother’s prayer.

“Over THE HILL FROM THE Poor-HOUSE” 
I, who was always counted, they say, 
Rather a bad stick anyway, 
Splintered all over with dodges and tricks, 
Known as the worst of the deacon’s six; 
I, the truant, saucy and bold, 
The one black sheep in my father’s fold, 
Once on a time as the stories say, 
Went over the hill on a winter’s day, 
Over the Hill from the Poor-house. 
Tom could save what twenty could earn, 
But giving was something he never would learn, 
Isaac could half of the scripture speak, 
Committed a hundred verses a week, 
Never forgot and never slipped, 
But honor thy father and mother he skipped, 
As for Susan, her heart was kind 
And good: what there was of it, mind, 
Nothing too big and nothing too nice 
And nothing she would not sacrifice 
For one she loved, but that e’er one 
Was herself, when all was said and done, 
And Charley and Becky meant well, no doubt, 
But any one could pull them about. 
So all of our folks ranked well, you see, 
Except one poor fellow, and that was me, 
And when, one dark and rainy night, 
 
-P-A-G-E-265

A neighbor’s horse went out of sight, 
They hitched on me as the guilty chap 
That carried one end of the halter strap, 
But I think myself that view of the case ~ 
Wasn’t altogether out of place. 
But my mother denied it, as mothers do: 
But I inclined to think it was true, 
Though for me one thing might be said 
That I as well as the horse was led. 
For the worst of whiskey spurred me on 
Or else the deed wouldn’t never been done. 
But the keenest grief I ever felt 
‘Was when my mother beside me knelt, 
And cried and prayed till I melted down 
As I would not for half the horses in town, 
I kissed her fondly then and there; 
And swore henceforth to be honest and square. 
I served my sentence, a bitter pill, 
Some fellow should take who never will, 
Then I decided to go out west, 
Concludin’ ’twould suit my health the best, 
Where, how I prospered I never could tell 
But fortune seemed to like me well, 
And somehow every vein I struck 
Was always bubbling over with luck, 
And, better than that, I was steady and true, 
And put my good resolution through. 
And I wrote to a trusty old neighbour and said: 
“You tell them, old fellow, that I am dead, 
And died a Christian, ’twill please them more 
Than if I had lived the same as before. 
But when this neighbour, he wrote to me 
“Your mother is in the poor house,” said he, 
T had a resurrection straightway 
And started for her that very day, 
And when I arrived where I was grown 
T took good care that I shouldn’t be known,

And I bought the old cottage through and through 
Of some one Charley had sold it to. 
And kept back neither work nor gold 
To fix it up as it was of old; 
The same big fireplace, wide and high, 
Flung up its cinders towards the sky, 
The old clock ticked on the corner shelf, 
I wound it and set a goin’ myself, 
And if everything wasn’t just the same 
Neither I nor money was to blame, 
Then Over the Hill to the Poor-house. 
One blowin’, blustering winter’s day 
With a team and cutter I started away, 
My fiery nags were as black as coal, 
They somewhat resembled the horse I stole, 
I hitched, and entered the poor-house door ; 
A poor old woman was scrubbin’ the floor. 
She rose to her feet with great surprise, 
And looked quite startled into my eyes; 
I saw the whole of her trouble trace 
In the lines that marred her dear old face. 
“Mother!” I shouted, “your sorrows are done; 
You are adopted at last by your horse-thief son, 
Come ‘Over the Hill from the Poor-house.’” 
She didn’t faint, but she knelt by my side 
And thanked the Lord till I fairly cried. 
And may be our ride wasn’t pleasant and gay, 
And may be she wasn’t wrapped up that day. 
And may be our cottage wasn’t warm and bright, 
And may be it wasn’t a pleasant sight 
To see her gettin’ the evening tea 
And frequently stoppin’ and kissin’ me, 
And may be we didn’t live happy for years 
In spite of my brothers’ and sisters’ sneers ; 
Who have often said, as I have heard, 
They wouldn’t own a prison bird.

Though they are gettin’ over that, I guess, 
For all of them owe me more or less. 
But I’ve learned one thing, and it cheers a man, 
In always doin’ the best he can, 
That whether on the big book, a blot 
Gets over a fellow’s name or not, 
Whenever he does a deed that is right 
It’s credited to him fair and bright, 
And when you hear the great bugle’s notes 
And the Lord divides his sheep and goats; 
However they may settle my case, 
Wherever they may fix my place, 
My good old Christian mother you'll see 
Will be sure to stand right up for me, 
With “Over the Hill from the Poor-house.” 
Witt Carleton. 
This passion, the love and consideration for one’s fel- 
lows, is very strong in the normal man. Its play in the 
lives of men brings out the highest and best of all 
virtues. It begets courage, bravery, sacrifice, self- 
abnegation, honesty, justice and love. It would put 
down the brute force and exalt the beautiful, the true 
and the good. Its heart is lovely though rough and 
weather-beaten the exterior. 
A beautiful example of this wonderful passion is seen 
in an incident which occurred at the Argonaut gold mine, 
California, 1922, when forty-seven miners were trapped 
and perished in the mines. One writer, describing the 
Herculean efforts of the workers to rescue their fellow- 
workmen, says: 
“T have been down. I have mucked with a shovel in 
a hole that sends me reeling to the surface, sick, after 
six hours of work—and the men I worked with. Let 
it be written in the annals of pessimists and cynics that 
pure altruism still runs in an indelible vein through this

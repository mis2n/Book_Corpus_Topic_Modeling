PRINCIPLES 
OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
FOR HISTORICAL STUDIES 
INTRODUCTION 
Students in all fields have more or less need 
of notes. But inquirers concerning human things 
are peculiarly dependent upon this sort of tool. 
The matters they are interested in are mostly not 
to be seen, save by imagination. And the ma- 
terials with which to imagine them cannot always 
be at hand. Even when at hand these materials 
may have too many peculiarities and _ short- 
comings for the memory to cope with safely. 
Against such circumstances relatively little prog- 
ress is likely, for any large number of us, without 
a lot of note-making and note-using. 
How can this situation be met to best advan- 
tage? What arrangements, what procedure con- 
cerning notes, should prove of most service to 
workers in the human field, especially if they take 
the historical point of view? Many an older 
3
-P-A-G-E-10
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
worker in the field, however successful at length, 
might have done still better, at least done with far 
less pains, had his practices in regard to notes 
been more fitting. Certainly many a beginner has 
suffered much and long on the rocks of an ill-con- 
ceived note-system. These beginners, at least, 
can they not be offered better counsel than has 
oftentimes been their lot? 
The counsel, fortunately, need not aim at com- 
pleteness. It would be idle to attempt a solution 
of the problem that would serve fully for any one 
student, to say nothing of a solution that might 
suffice for all. For in fact a note-system at its best 
must be very largely an individual thing. It 
should be expected to meet the particular needs 
and tastes of the person concerned. And even the 
same person will find his need or tastes varying 
with the work he may be doing — varying greatly 
probably in the course of a few undertakings. 
There remain, however, after due respect is 
paid alike to individual needs and to individual 
idiosyncrasies, certain factors in the problem that 
are more or less common, essential in some sense 
for all. They are essential in the sense of being 
key points. The conclusions reached upon them 
need in no way prevent wide variety of applica- 
tion; but if they are decided unfittingly, or are 
not decided at all, confusion and halting are likely 
4
-P-A-G-E-11
INTRODUCTION 
to result. Such points are open for common con- 
sideration and general advice. They should be 
distinguished and grasped and in some way ap- 
propriately provided for, from the outset. And it 
may be said that only those who begin by attend- 
ing thus to these common essentials will be in po- 
sition to make variations or adaptations with 
most advantage, in response to individual de- 
mands or fancies. 
The problem only gains in significance if proper 
account is taken of its range socially, its clientele 
asit were. Those concerned are of course all who 
would work in the human field as professional 
specialists, in history, or political science, or eco- 
nomics, or sociology, with the object of investiga- 
tion, or of teaching, or of writing for the public. 
But the human studies cannot be left simply to 
such professionals. The fundamental practices 
characteristic of them must enter, indeed in in- 
creasing measure, into the everyday conduct of 
the world’s affairs. And they who share practi- 
cally in these affairs have need in varying degree 
to make and use notes. Certainly those most ac- 
tively so concerned, the journalists and reformers 
and preachers and statesmen and officials and 
their expert aids, have very large need of notes. 
There is no reason for thinking, with reference 
to any or all of these, that their fundamental 
5 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
practices in the matter should differ essentially 
from the practices reasonable for an investigator 
or writer of history. 
And the young folk being trained in the schools, 
all that throng we are helping get ready for some 
vocation and for some share as citizens: they 
need, whatever else, to be occupied very much 
with human life and affairs. Like older students, 
they have occasion to make notes on such affairs; 
the further they go the more their occasion. What 
such folk do in this matter should not be left to 
chance, to their own immature judgment. They 
too should better make their decisions and plans 
in the light of at least the more fundamental con- 
clusions to be drawn from the needs and experi- 
ences of professionals in the field. 
What then, again, may be said to be the chief 
counsels from expert experience on this problem? 
What may be regarded as principles concerning 
a note-system for history, and to a large degree 
various kindred studies? 
1In the text of what follows the writer has profited much from 
suggestions by two friends on whom it seemed possible to impose, 
Professors A. OC. McLaughlin, University of Chicago, and A. C. 
Krey, University of Minnesota. They are not chargeable, however, 
—ither of them to the slightest degree—with the shortcomings 
left. Any cares other readers may take about what should be in 
such a book will be cordially appreciated.

UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
Need of Elasticity 
NOTE-SYSTEM needs first of all to have 
its contents freely transferable. All that is 
in it should be in distinctive units, each complete 
in itself and each so marked or described as to be 
readily recognized and easily manipulated. One 
should be in position not only to apply data or re- 
flections at any point or points that might seem 
appropriate, but to do so with the least possible 
tax upon time and energy. 
This means, use loose slips or sheets. With 
them one can make notes quite separately, so that 
each, no matter what its length, will be a unit by 
itself. Notes thus separately made can then be 
put here or there at will; classified now in one 
way, now in another; employed, as first written, 
for various purposes in succession. Duplication 
of effort, renoting of the same matter, may be 
reduced—especially by the aid of cross-references 
—to a minimum. 
A note-system needs also to have its contents 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
  freely extendable or changeable at any point; 
so that the way will always be clear for growth, 
on any matter. Human affairs are too complex 
and uncertain to be known or interpreted satisfac- 
torily at first sight. What a student is able to 
know about any of them at one time may differ 
considerably from what he finds later, with addi- 
tional data or another point of view. And the re- 
sults reached by one inquirer always need to be 
controlled by the findings and reflections of fel- 
low workers. Especially as to modern or recent 
doings, like the French occupation of the Ruhr 
for instance, or the League of Nations, the oppor- 
tunities for difference are so many that responsi- 
bility is only multiplied to consider every signifi- 
cant matter from all angles and with all new 
information. 
Here again the command of the circumstances 
is, use loose slips or sheets. With them, exten- 
sions or changes that may seem desirable are easy 
to make. With them an inquirer can both repre- 
sent his tracks or gleanings to date on any matter, 
and also provide effectively, economically, for ad- 
ditions, subtractions, or reshapings as his study 
or knowledge develops. 
It can of course be urged that a great lot of 
fine work has been done without use of loose slips 
or sheets. Gibbon for instance made all his notes 
8
-P-A-G-E-15
  UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
in books of fast-bound leaves. James Ford 
Rhodes used notebooks of the old type. And so it 
will doubtless be to the end: some persons will 
prefer, for one reason or another, the older way. 
But the great majority of serious workers, distin- 
guished and other, have now a different view. 
They prefer the loose slips or sheets. The advan- 
tages thereof, beginning with perfect elasticity, 
are too commanding to be unheeded. 
Notes on Small Slips 
Primarily, or usually, it is advantageous to 
employ some sort of small slip. Most of the 
things the average worker has occasion to make 
note of are so brief that they are readily put on 
a single such slip. If the matter is too long for 
one slip, not impossibly the most convenient way 
of caring for it is to use several such slips, paged 
consecutively.1 Anyway, when notes become nu- 
merous, small slips are easier to manipulate than 
a lot of sheets more or less large. 
The slips should usually be small; but still, how 
small? Of just what size? 
An important factor here is the individual con- 
cerned, and the dominant use to which he puts 
his note-making. A student of linguistic usage, 
1 Many, however, would urge that small slips ought not to be used 
in series, that a note recorded on such material should be so con- 
structed as always to come within the bounds of one piece of paper. 
9
-P-A-G-E-16
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
for example, having occasion to make thousands 
of brief records of such small matters as the spell- 
ing or pronunciation of a word, might well prefer 
a slip no larger than 2x4. On the other hand, any 
person writing a coarse or heavy hand would 
probably not care for a very small slip, whatever 
his interests. 
One solution of the problem about size of small 
slips is to adopt some particular size, and adhere 
to it consistently. This gives full assurance of 
at least easy manipulation, no matter how many 
notes may be accumulated. 
For those inclined to this solution—and the 
number will doubtless be large—the form taken 
by the problem, at least in English-speaking lands 
and certainly in the United States, will ordinarily 
be: shall I adopt the 3x5 slip or the 4x6? Both 
of these sizes may be called standard, not only in 
respect of proved advantage when put to use, 
but also in respect of being convenient to obtain 
and care for. Both sizes, in considerable variety 
of material, are commonly provided through the 
trade—in case one should not wish to look after 
the selecting and cutting of paper one’s self. And 
especially, they are commonly provided for: suit- 
able boxes or cases in which to put them are easily 
had. 
Whether the student inclined to a single uni- 
10
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
form slip choose the one or the other of these 
sizes, he will probably have moments of wishing 
he had decided differently. The writer has heard 
one American scholar who long used the 3x5 and 
accumulated a great many slips, express regret 
that he had not adopted the larger size. And 
there are doubtless instances of regret, or actual 
change, in the other direction. 
But adoption of some particular size and strict 
adherence thereto are not absolutely incumbent. 
One may indeed arrange to use both the 3x5 and 
the 4x6, reserving the smaller size say for some 
particular kind of note. Or, a student can give 
himself still more freedom, arranging to use sev- 
eral sizes, or within a limit to use almost any 
scrap of paper that may happen to be at hand. 
The essential is to have at least some limit, some 
standard for the size of slips above which not to 
go. It is still possible thus to accommodate the 
slips to a uniform plan of filing. For example, if 
4x6 be adopted as the standard, or upper limit, 
one can file with slips of this size pieces of any 
size or sizes below it; and can transfer or re- 
classify them more or less easily. No doubt, the 
more nearly uniform the slips may be in size the 
easier will be their manipulation. But with uni- 
formity at least at the top, the filing and changing 
about can be managed; and for the less conven- 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
ience of manipulation that may result there will 
be compensations in the freedom as to size of 
slip that will appeal strongly to many workers. 
Considerable support for the freer way is to 
be found in the heterogeneous grist that may come 
more or less ready to one’s mill. The average 
worker, besides making notes of the usual sort, 
is likely to make clippings, or collect cards; or 
people send him clippings or cards, or possibly 
notes on cards or pieces of paper of size dictated 
by their own needs or tastes. In at least large 
part such accumulations are sure to be small 
pieces, suitable for filing with the great mass of 
small notes entirely of one’s own constructing. 
But obviously it will be easier to care for this 
sort of stuff if one is not committed too rigidly 
to slips of a single size—if one has rather only 
an upper limit or standard. In this connection 
too a distinct advantage may be observed for as 
large a standard as 4x6. For certainly a greater 
variety of cards, clippings, and such like can be 
filed behind 4x6 slips than behind 3x5’s. 
Another problem about small slips concerns the 
material of which they should be made. What 
sort or quality of paper should be used? 
Many of the notes one makes are likely to prove 
quite temporary. A student may even make many 
notes knowing from the outset they will be tem- 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
porary—may for instance do his composing in 
that way, and not care what happens to the manu- 
script of slips when the matter has been typed. 
Wherever this temporary character can be fore- 
seen, it obviously makes little difference what 
quality of paper is used: almost anything that 
takes a pencil or pen easily will serve. The ma- 
terial in such cases certainly need not be expen- 
sive. 
But most of the notes one makes are to be more 
or less permanent. They are at least so designed. 
They are likely, too, to be handled a good deal; a 
large share of them, indeed, a very great deal. 
Clearly, wherever such is the case the slips should 
be of good quality. They should not necessarily 
be thick or heavy, but should have a firm or re- 
sisting texture. The more sure a person may be, 
about any sort of notes he makes, that they will 
have long or hard usage, the more should he be 
at pains to provide paper adapted to such pros- 
pect. 
Notes on Larger Slips or Sheets 
For most notes then, at least for the average 
worker, slips or pieces of small size. But there 
is need also for sheets or pieces more or less 
large. 
After all, with regard to many matters one 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
wishes to record, it is not convenient to rely on 
small slips. Many of the copyings, for instance, 
that one may make or cause to be made from ar- 
chive materials are much better on fairly large 
sheets. Many extracts or abstracts made from 
books are really too long to be conveniently cared 
for on small slips. Frequently enough—quite 
habitually with some workers—the data collected 
or in process upon a given matter may prove 
much easier to grasp and manage if set down to- 
gether on a larger sheet, or perhaps a series of 
such sheets, than if left or put only on small slips. 
Certainly many workers will prefer large sheets 
when engaged in composition. 
Then, a great lot of that grist coming more or 
less ready to one’s mill is in pieces of larger size. 
So it is with most of the circulars or announce- 
ments about books, meetings, and new undertak- 
ings. These, as well as the smaller things of this 
character, need to be accommodated in one’s files. 
Most of the offprints that arrive, and the pam- 
phlets of other sorts, are in octavo or near that. 
Practically all of the letters one receives, and 
wishes to preserve, are fairly large. Oftentimes 
it is better to tear up books or cut out portions 
of them for incorporation in one’s notes than to 
write out extracts or abstracts from them; and 
such books are usually of some size. 
14
-P-A-G-E-21
  UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
So useful indeed is it possible for the larger 
sheets to seem that a good many may easily think 
them more advantageous than the small slips, as 
a main reliance. At least one distinguished 
American scholar has made them the chief factor 
in his note-system, to such degree as to have no 
place for smaller pieces save as they might be 
filed with the larger; and has freely counseled 
others to do likewise. 
To the great majority of us that will probably 
appear to be carrying the point too far, trans- 
gressing the limits, or conditions, of real con- 
venience. It is clear however that to have a note- 
system sufficiently elastic for all ordinary de- 
mands, one must have full provision in it for 
large sheets or pieces as well as the smaller. 
But just what form should the provision take, 
particularly as to size and uniformity? For the 
large pieces in turn the same problem arises as 
for the smaller. And substantially the same an- 
swer is to be made. 
Probably a good many will be inclined, es- 
pecially as to notes entirely of their own making, 
to adopt some particular size—say 8x10—and ad- 
here thereto as strictly as possible. Probably far 
the larger number however will prefer greater 
elasticity, and arrange for an upper limit or 
standard, to which any lesser size may be ac- 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
commodated. On the whole, the argument for this 
is even stronger with reference to the large sheets 
than for the smaller slips; since the large pieces 
that arrive more or less ready are as a rule much 
more various as to size than the similar smaller 
things. Not unlikely the most convenient upper 
limit to adopt for the larger series would be 
9x11, or some size very near that, a bit less or a 
bit more; at all events a size that would file read- 
ily in a 10x12 case of the kind customary in offices, 
or would go in special folders that might be kept 
on the shelves of one’s library. 
Even the sheets that will file say in a 10x12 case 
will not suffice for all of the needs of every worker, 
possibly not for all needs of the average worker. 
Oftentimes one will wish to construct a map, or 
arrange data in the form of a chart, or carry 
out some study in a rough or free-hand way on 
a paper of large dimensions. Or maps and charts 
obtainable by purchase or otherwise may seem de- 
sirable additions to one’s tools of other kinds. 
Just what constructions or acquisitions should be 
made must be determined by each student in the 
light of his problems. But it is well to recognize 
that these extraordinary or more unusual require- 
ments in respect of larger pieces are quite likely 
to arise, and that such pieces tend to become in- 
conveniences rather than helps unless appropriate 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  UNBOUND SLIPS OR SHEETS 
provision is made for them. They call for some 
sort of file or case sufficiently generous in dimen- 
sions to accommodate the largest piece of the lot. 
Summary 
The elasticity requisite in a note-system may be 
had then by employing unbound slips or sheets. 
But there is a good deal of choice as to the size 
or sizes a student may think appropriate for his 
circumstances. The 3x5 cards or slips are com- 
monly recognized as the most easy to file and 
manipulate; and as especially suitable for notes 
of the smallest scope, like bibliographical or sta- 
tistical data, or perhaps for persons writing a 
very small hand. The 4x6 type of slip or card is 
also easily filed and handled, accommodates more 
matter, and gives more freedom for labels or crit- 
icisms. Sheets as large, say, as 9x11 are appro- 
priate for fuller quotations or analyses, or for 
exposition and more discursive comment; and 
may serve as supports or backs for clippings and 
pictures. The yet larger sheets or cards do well 
for maps, charts, or large pictures. Also, what- 
ever selection or selections in respect of size may 
seem best, far greater elasticity will be gained if 
one adopt an upper limit, or several upper limits, 
rather than try to adhere rigidly to some fixed 
size or sizes.

KINDS OF NOTES 
From Difference in Character of Matters Noted 
HATEVER the size of slip or sheet em- 
ployed, due respect should be paid, in 
making a note, to the character of what is to be 
noted. 
One prime object in making notes is to have 
as easily available as possible appropriate in- 
formation or conclusions about things that are 
to be used as sources of information—especially 
documents and works. The notes made or col- 
lected in pursuit of this object may be called 
bibliographical and critical; or simply, with suffi- 
ciently liberal interpretation of the term, biblio- 
graphical. 
Another prime object in making notes is to 
have record in the most convenient or effective 
way of the data or ‘‘facts’’ found in sources of 
information, or the conclusions built from such 
findings. The results reached in pursuit of this 
object may properly be called subject notes. 
It is absolutely essential to keep these two ob- 
18
-P-A-G-E-25
KINDS OF NOTES 
jects distinguished, however interwoven their pur- 
suit may be in practice. A mongrel note—part 
bibliographical, part subject—may appear use- 
ful on occasion, suitable for special circumstances. 
But generally, and in principle, a student should 
be at pains when making a note to have primarily 
in view either one object or the other, 
The difference may be expressed materially, if 
one wishes; for instance, by putting bibliograph- 
ical data on slips or cards of special size or color. 
But whatever is done thus, it should appear also 
in the construction or form given to the note: 
one general form or set of forms for bibliograph- 
ical notes; another form or set of forms for subject 
notes. 
From Difference in Authority Directly Repre- 
sented 
Quite as essential, in making notes, is a dis- 
tinction about the authority or foundation direct- 
ly represented. A great deal of what the maker 
of a note may wish to put down will be what an- 
other, or others, say or think. A great deal, on 
the other hand, will be, properly speaking, as- 
cribable to himself: either strictly his own knowl- 
edge, or reflecting, or assuming, or concluding; 
or his own through use of some authority or 
sources he considers more or less acceptable. 
19
-P-A-G-E-26
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
A worker should always be fully conscious, as 
he makes note of something, which he is doing; 
should know without the slightest doubt whether 
he is representing himself, or some one or others 
else. And also, if time and energy are to be econo- 
mized fittingly, the same worker should be in 
position, on returning to what he has noted, to 
distinguish any statement of his own from state- 
ments by others; to know surely and quickly, 
’ whether at this or that point to regard himself 
as speaking or somebody else. 
So, on this point too due provision should be 
made in the technique—in the mechanics, as it 
were—of one’s note-practice. Often enough, to 
be sure, the matter may be managed without any 
distinctive arrangement: what the worker has to 
say himself can be regarded as simply additional, 
or incidental, and be set down where it seems to 
apply or where convenience may dictate. But in 
general, and for certain sorts of circumstances 
especially, it is best to have some clear way of 
marking the difference. At least many notes— 
both of the bibliographical and of the subject sort 
but very especially of the subject sort (as will be 
explained later)—should have something in their 
manner of construction by which it would be easily 
recognized whether or not the maker of the note 
was directly represented therein.

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
Points for Inquiry 
F a student would be in position to use a docu- 
ment or work of any sort trustworthily, he © 
must have answers to certain questions about it. 
Or at least he must know to what degree he has or 
lacks answers to these questions. 
First, who did the piece? Certainly no piece 
can be of use on any matter save in the measure it 
represents some relation on the part of some per- 
son or persons to the matter in question. Is the 
piece accompanied by indications of who did it? 
Such indications are often lacking; or if given are 
not always to be trusted. To know who by name 
may not always be possible, or even necessary. 
But, in principle, one needs to locate the responsi- 
bility for the existence of the piece, to know as 
definitely as possible about its authorship. 
Second, what exactly is the piece? That is, 
what is it about, and what sort of thing is it? 
What did its author or authors intend it to be as 
they spoke it or wrote it? Does it for example 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
record some trial in court? Or give report upon 
certain military operations just engaged in? Or 
communicate to the public some new law or ad- 
ministrative rule? Or is it perchance a private 
letter, about personal or family or public affairs? 
Or is it an article or book embodying some study 
or discussion? A sufficient description of the 
piece may have been given to it when being made, 
as a title possibly or in some other way. On the 
other hand, such description may be quite lack- 
ing; or may be given too meagerly, or more or 
less untrustworthily. In any case it is as essen- 
tial to have as clear and sure knowledge about 
what the piece is as about whence it came. 
Third, in what form or state is the piece? Hs- 
pecially, what is its case as to text? The person 
or persons responsible for it at the outset wrote 
it or left it in a certain condition; presumably the 
condition in which it was desired to be, or at least 
a state thought to express what the author or 
authors had in mind to say. Is it this original that 
is now before the student? If not the actual tan- 
gible original, is it such a reproduction or repre- 
sentation thereof as may be trusted to give the 
piece just as the author or authors wrote it—a 
photograph for example, or a good edition? Or 
is the piece in some state into which departures 
from the original may have entered: for instance 
22 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
a translation into another language? Or an adap- 
tation by some person or party with an axe to 
grind? Or even a copy, or several copies, by hand 
—more or less subject to error though the copyist 
be neither careless nor incompetent? Possibly 
the piece has been issued in more than one text or 
form, in one or more editions for instance be- 
sides a first, and with changes in each edition. In 
this case, of just what edition is the copy at hand, 
or the copy under consideration? And also, what 
characteristics has this edition in comparison 
with the others? In case of a translation or adap- 
tation, from what exactly, in way of manuscript 
or edition, was the translating done, and with 
what purpose and competence? Clearly, to make 
really trustworthy use of any document or work, 
one must take whatever pains may be necessary 
as to the text or version in which it is available. 
Closely pendent to this, in what material condi- 
tion is the piece? Whatever its case as to text, 
is it well preserved, whole and sound? Or is it 
more or less mutilated, or otherwise in poor con- 
dition for use? 
Fourth, under what conditions or circumstances 
was the piece produced? Especially (assuming 
some one person was responsible for it): (a) 
What experience and qualities had the author? 
Who was he in the life of his time? What were 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
his traits physically? What sorts of competence 
had he acquired? What attitudes had he devel- 
oped toward men and things? Of what fiber was 
his character? (b) What degree or sort of con- 
tact did the author have with what he was speak- 
ing or writing about? Just where was his work 
done—where for instance he could and did depend 
upon observation and thinking by himself? Or 
was he depending, wholly or in part, on data— 
or perhaps on data and thinking—drawn from 
others? And just when was his work done—while 
the matter was in progress? Or immediately af- 
ter? Or some while later? (c) What was the 
author’s motive? To what degree was he disin- 
terested? Was he minded solely to speak or set 
down the truth? Or was he, more or less uncon- 
sciously, promoting his own self interest, or pos- 
sibly the interest of some group private or public? 
Fifth, what is the worth of the piece, having 
regard to what is knowable about it in reference 
to one or several or all of the four respects fore- 
going? Or what standing has the piece, rela- 
tively, when compared with other sources of in- 
formation on the same matter? In this case one’s 
regard must of course include what may be know- 
able concerning the other piece or pieces consid- 
ered, in the respect or respects in question. No 
answer about worth or standing may seem pos- 
24 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
sible on first acquaintance with a writing, and 
often for long after. But the query is none the 
less essential. 
These various questions might of course be 
grouped in another way, and named or described 
somewhat differently. For instance, good use 
might be found for the word provenience, or pro- 
venance, as a brief name for the matters about 
authorship and circumstances of production—for 
all about the origins or history of a piece. But 
whatever the arrangement or names employed, 
the essentials are as just given. Such are the sev- 
eral central points on which an inquirer needs in- 
formation, or at least to take stock of what he 
knows, concerning any document or work he 
would use appropriately. 
General Bibliographical Notes 
To meet these needs serviceably in a note way, 
it is usually best to begin—when the knowledge 
available about a given piece will permit—by mak- 
ing upon it at least one such note as is the ordi- 
nary library card of the author-work type. The 
library folk have been at much pains to have a 
eard whose data would both satisfy the require- 
ments of library administration and help fittingly 
the users of libraries. And they have suceeded in 
devising one that provides students with at least 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
the bare minima about a piece; a card that usually 
gives what is requisite for a start, when it does 
not answer sufficiently, upon four anyway of the 
five points about which inquiry is necessary. 
Thus, on (1) who did the piece, such a card tells 
briefly to what person or persons it was ascribed 
when produced (or when published), or perhaps 
under whose auspices or responsibility it was 
done; and may include a correction or explanation 
that seems warranted. On (2) what the piece is, 
the card gives as much anyway as the title under 
which it was produced or published, or under 
which it commonly passes—sometimes explains 
the title if it is not clear; and may add some state- 
ment about the contents, possibly a list of the 
chapter headings. On (3) the form or state of 
the piece, the card witnesses at least one form 
in which it exists—that to which the card referred 
when made: whether for instance in handwriting, 
or typewriting, or print; and if in print, perhaps 
as first printed, or in a second or other revised 
edition; and if edited by some other than the 
author, by whom, and possibly for what particu- 
larly the editor was responsible—notes for ex- 
ample, or maybe notes and introduction. Cer- 
tainly on the library card attention is given to the 
features of a piece materially: its size to start 
with, in format (if printed), and number of pages, 
26
-P-A-G-E-33
  BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
possibly size in inches or centimeters (few how- 
ever except librarians will care just how high a 
book stands on the shelf); the illustrations, if 
any, and maybe the typography ; the state of pres- 
ervation possibly in which the piece or copy in 
question is—whether some parts are missing, for 
instance, or are unusable. On (4) the cireum- 
stances about the production of the piece, the 
card is pretty sure to give the time and place of 
publication, and probably the agency or channel 
of publication—a publishing house, for example, 
or possibly some scientific organization: items 
that may not be equivalent to time and place of 
production or reveal much else as to the produc- 
ing in question, but that are indispensable as a 
beginning thereon. 
A library card, it may be urged, suggests mostly 
printed matter; and besides that mostly works 
of a sort to have more or less separate or individ- 
ual publication, through the trade, or some peri- 
odical, or some scientific series. The serious stu- 
dent, however, while the object of his inquiry must 
often be a work of this sort, may also have to find 
out about matter that was never printed, or trace 
a writing in both printed and unprinted states. 
He must frequently too have to do with docu- 
ments rather than works, and with many pieces of 
so small size or so little moment that they never

-P-A-G-E-34
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
reach the shelves of a library in a separate way 
but are conserved only with a lot of others, in the 
midst of some fonds, or collection, or series—pos- 
sibly not even catalogued. Nevertheless, what- 
ever kind of written or printed piece one’s quest 
may be about, the library card of author-work 
type illustrates fairly well the primary or founda- 
tional sort of note it is usually best to try to make 
at the beginning; a note, that is, showing at least 
some such answers as are customary on the card 
to the questions, Who? What? Form or state? 
Circumstances of production. 
The very order in which the data on a library 
card are put may well be adopted: first, and near 
the top, the name of the author (with the last name 
first) or responsible group or organization; then 
the title; then the other items. A student might 
not always wish to conform to this order fully, or 
always to include all of the points. He might for 
instance engage in studies concerning Europe in 
which it would not be convenient to put the last 
name of the author first. Or again, in reference 
to some important piece or collection, he might 
find the authorship so various or so inconvenient 
to specify that he would prefer to omit everything 
about provenience and begin simply with the 
name of the writing or collection considered. But 
apart from a few exceptions dictated by such con- 
28
-P-A-G-E-35
  BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
ditions, it will be advantageous not to depart 
much from the usual plan of the card. For that 
matter the libraries also vary practice, where 
there seems need. 
In making a bibliographical note of this kind, 
a worker may possibly have the piece in question 
before him and reach his conclusions by direct 
examination of it. Or he may be depending, for 
the data he sets down, upon some library card— 
one made for example at the library of Congress 
in Washington,—or on some bibliography or 
other sort of work he is inclined to trust for the 
purpose. It is well to be able to know, at any 
time afterward, just what one did in this respect. 
So record should be made briefly, somewhere on 
the slip or card employed—on the back if not 
the face of it—of the source of information de- 
pended upon. 
Space permitting, a personal query or observa- 
tion by the maker of the note may be included. 
Or, if not too long, an explanation or comment by 
the author of the source or work concerned, or 
perhaps by an editor or some reviewer, may be 
reproduced. 
If the piece considered has appeared in several 
texts or versions, one general note may suffice or 
may not. The object in view may possibly be 
very limited: for instance, to know about the 
29
-P-A-G-E-36
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
latest or best edition of a given document or work, 
or just the first edition, and merely incidentally 
about any other editions or versions. In such cir- 
cumstance, a brief indication or statement about 
the other editions, or another edition or version, 
can simply be added somewhere to the main note 
one is doing—or perhaps has done previously. 
In other circumstances the restricted indica- 
tions thus addable to a major note would be quite 
insufficient. A different inquirer with less limited 
needs, or perhaps the same inquirer at a less 
pressing moment, would wish to know more ad- 
vantageously about a given document or work; 
would wish to know, that is, in just what forms 
it had been accessible to others and the ori- 
gin of each form. In such case he ought, as a 
start, to have record or know where he can get 
record of at least as much about each distinctive 
form in which the piece may have appeared as 
would be given on a library card. And one way 
of providing for this is to make a note of just that 
kind for each of the distinctive forms. In other 
words a student may often account it best to try 
to have, on a given document or work, not simply 
one general note like a library card but such a 
note on each of its editions or versions. 
The more common circumstances or situations 
in which a general bibliographical note should be 
30

of service, and suggestions of procedure appro- 
priate thereto, are shown in Examples at the end. 
Examples 1 and following apply to primary 
sources; 11 and following, to modern works. 
Supplementary Bibliographical Notes 
As a usual beginning then, at least one general 
note; and in case of wishing to record further 
information, either enter it on the same note slip 
or make a new note, or new notes, of the general 
sort. But a plan limited to these practices for 
the bibliographical notes would very often not 
prove convenient. 
A general note already made might not be at 
hand when some additional data proved available 
that were too meager or applied too singly to one 
point to call for the making of a new note of the 
general sort (designed to give at least brief an- 
swers on several points). Or, it might not be pos- 
sible to make even one general note: the requisite 
information might be still to seek, and the search 
therefor prove long or at least very intermittent 
—one would wish to record the results as they de- 
veloped, and maybe separately. Frequently, 
again, the information acquired or that ought to 
be acquired would need more space, for statement 
or discussion, than could be available in a note like 
the library card. This might happen about any 
31
-P-A-G-E-38
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
of the points on which inquiry should center, but 
especially concerning the circumstances under 
which a piece was made. <A careful student con- 
templating use of the Great Charter for knowl- 
edge upon some matter, or of the Declaration of 
Independence, or Machiavelli’s The Prince, would 
wish to know far more about the origin thereof 
than time and place of publication. And what he 
would wish to have his own record of concerning 
even a lesser piece might easily require one spe- 
cial note at least, and possibly several, made may- 
be at different times. 
Obviously besides bibliographical notes of the 
general sort, with brief indications sometimes 
added thereto, there should be separate biblio- 
graphical notes of supplementary or partial (or 
special) nature. They will provide convenient 
means of recording or referring to any data or 
discussion that may seem worth while about a 
source or work, regardless of whether a general 
note already made is at hand or not, regardless 
even of whether a note of the general sort has 
been made on the piece. How, accordingly, should 
these separate special notes be made, to be of 
most help? 
Each such special or supplementary note should 
be started with an indication to what it relates. 
Let a worker begin then near the top of the slip 
32
-P-A-G-E-39
  BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
and a little space from the left edge (say an inch) 
with the name of the author (or in many cases 
editor or producing group or organization), and 
tell immediately thereafter, or after some such 
symbol as a colon or semicolon, in the same line 
if possible with the name of the author or editor 
or producing agency, the writing or writings in 
view. The indication both of the author’s name 
and of the production or productions in question 
may well be made with a good deal of abbrevi- 
ation, since the object is merely to show, in a 
way that will be conveniently recognizable, to 
what the note is meant to relate. Sometimes how- 
ever, just as for a general note, the authorship or 
producing agency will seem so various or so in- 
convenient to specify that it may be better to omit 
everything thereon and begin rather with the 
name of the writing or collection concerned. 
For some illustrations of the practice suggested 
here, see the Examples of supplementary notes at 
the end (here and there with Numbers 1-16). 
With this sort of beginning it is always possible 
to see, immediately and definitely, to just what 
the note refers. Also, no matter how many such 
notes are made on a given piece, or on several 
or many pieces, all can be filed in a way to be 
easily found: either back of a general bibliograph- 
ical note on the matter, or if no such note has 
33
-P-A-G-E-40
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
been prepared, still at their places alphabetically 
among any notes with which they may be grouped. 
Having started a special or supplementary note 
by indicating to what it relates, a worker may 
wish to continue simply by telling where and by 
whom is something on the writing or writings con- 
cerned—just to point the way to information or 
comment of which it seems desirable to have trace. 
This offers little or no difficulty. Begin, on a line 
somewhat below the name of the author or writ- 
ings under consideration, with the name of the 
author or authors of the source of information in 
view (or if the authorship is unknown, one may 
say Anonymous); and follow immediately with 
the title (probably abbreviated) of the source of 
information, or with whatever indication about 
what it is may seem appropriate (very often it 
will be a note or review in some periodical and 
have no separate title). Then give what may be 
necessary concerning where and when the source 
of information was produced or published, and 
concerning volume and page. For an illustration 
or two, see Examples 11b and 4a. 
In a large share of his supplimentary biblio- 
graphical notes, a worker will wish, not simply 
to show where and by whom is something by an- 
other, or others, but to go on and record what that 
other, or those others, said. When such is the 
34 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
case, it may sometimes seem desirable to quote 
or excerpt an account or discussion in full, or sub- 
stantially in full, even if long. Usually, it will 
suffice either to give the whole by some sort of 
analysis, or to analyze the material selectively 
and reproduce some particular statement or point, 
or perhaps several particular statements or 
points. 
What kinds of analysis are possible is explained 
apropos of a like problem connected with the 
making of subject notes. And in Examples 5b 
and 18a are illustrations of notes showing selected 
information or data about a document or work. 
The essential problem with such analyzing is of 
course to have the results represent, quite as 
faithfully as would quotation in full, what the 
author or authors of the statements concerned 
meant to say. 
Often the problem will be not to set down a quo- 
tation about a writing more or less in full or an 
analysis of some kind, but to arrange a relevant 
clipping or excerpt, or perhaps pamphlet, for 
filing. Such things many students will accumulate 
in large number. In so far as they relate to 
sources of information, as such, they should be 
filed with bibliographical notes. And probably 
most of them will be treatable as notes of the 
supplementary kind. 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
In great part a student’s supplementary notes 
must be made so as to show not statements by 
another or others about some source or work, but 
some description or comment of his own. What 
he has in mind to put down may have been derived 
from his own examination of the piece in question, 
or it may have come from hearing or reading 
statements by others—for example, in some crit- 
ical review or note of the piece. However it came 
to him, on whatever authority it rests, the thing 
to be recorded is some information or conclusion 
or idea that may be regarded as his, or as having 
become his. It would be consistent with the plan 
just suggested for representing what someone 
else said if the student should put his own name— 
or initials—at the point where someone else’s 
name would normally appear, and should then 
proceed to make his own statement. If however, 
under such circumstances, he should simply omit 
any formal indication of the origin of what is 
being noted, he would have a convenient and dis- 
tinctive way of showing when a supplementary 
note was meant to represent something coming 
directly from himself rather than from another. 
For some illustrations of appropriate practice in 
this connection see Examples 8a, 9a, 15a. 
Whether a worker puts down his own name, or 
initials, (or omits them) a supplementary note de- 
36
-P-A-G-E-43
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
signed to represent something coming directly 
from one’s self should ordinarily include indica- 
tion of the source or sources of information on 
which the maker of the note relied. Certainly 
one’s plans should include provision for this. 
The most convenient place for the indication may 
very likely seem, in most instances, the end of the 
note (as in the Examples just cited). But fre- 
quently enough several indications will be re- 
quired in the course of a single note. In such cir- 
cumstances, each indication may be made in pa- 
rentheses or brackets at the point where it applies; 
or a figure or other symbol may be entered there 
and the statement as to source of information, 
introduced by the same symbol, placed on the back 
of the slip—or maybe on a supplementary slip of 
some sort. 
Bibliographical Notes on Parts of Writings 
The two sorts of notes, general and supple- 
mentary, serve excellently as long as one’s quest 
relates to a source or work more or less as a whole, 
or to some division or unit thereof that may seem 
regardable as a separate whole. The first helps 
on as many as possible of the various essential 
questions—Who? What? Form or state? Cir- 
cumstances of production? Worth or standing? 
The other records anything additional that may 
37 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
look useful on one or another of these questions. 
Frequently however, possibly most frequently 
with many students, the problem may be to have 
convenient record of only a limited portion of a 
source or work. And the portion in view may be 
even so limited as to amount to but a few pages, 
or to a paragraph or so, or still less. Its sub- 
ject too may or may not be indicated, at least 
adequately, say by a heading in the text, or on the 
margin, or in the table of contents. What prac- 
tice, in such circumstances, should prove con- 
venient? 
The beginning should be as in the general and 
supplementary types; that is with the author’s 
name at the top and toward the left of the slip or 
card. Next, the subject concerned; preferably, 
the writer would say, in the same line with the 
author’s name, or starting in that line. In case 
a clear statement of the subject accompanies the 
matter it may be used in the note. Otherwise a 
statement or explanation must be framed by the 
maker of the note. Then, indication of where the 
matter appears; in what publication that is, or 
perhaps what manuscript. This can usually be 
done very briefly; indeed largely by abbreviation, 
if one wishes: because details about the publica- 
tion or manuscript in question have very likely 
been recorded on another note, or other notes, of 
38
-P-A-G-E-45
  BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
the general or of the supplementary kind—or 
might be so recorded ;—and reference can simply 
be made thereto. Finally, any information or com- 
ment one may think pertinent and useful on the 
particular portion of work or document under 
consideration. For a few illustrations of the 
practice suggested here, see Examples beginning 
with 21. 
Subject-Bibliographical Notes 
A great many students will think still another 
sort of bibliographical note desirable. They will 
wish to have some way of indicating the subject 
treated in each writing or part of writing noted, 
so that all notes marked as about pieces or parts 
treating a given subject may be readily distin- 
guished and grouped together according to need. 
Notes constructed with special emphasis of this 
purpose may be called subject-bibliographical. 
In such case the best place for indication of 
the subject is clearly the space near the top of the 
slip or card. Then what is put below that, or 
the rest of the note, may be according to any of 
the three types just described—general, supple- 
mentary, or on a selected part of a writing. In 
the last type, however, the subject having been 
indicated at the top of the slip the name of the 
author represented may be given rather with the 
39 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
      PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
writing concerned. For illustration of each type 
see Examples beginning with 25. 
The subject being thus singled out and shown 
so prominently, some may wonder if what is here 
in view should not be called a subject note. The 
answer is no; because the statement of subject is 
only a label for help concerning content and ar- 
rangement. All else with it on the slip or card is 
about a source or work, not about the subject in- 
dicated. And possibly this should be added: how- 
ever serviceable the subject-bibliographical sort 
of note may seem to perhaps the great majority 
of workers, it is not after all imperative. It can 
be employed just as extensively or just as little 
as the worker concerned may choose. One can for 
instance use it for all bibliographical notes; or 
restrict it to notes on parts of writings; or not 
use it at all, and get on quite happily—relying 
rather, for special aid in subject-indicating, upon 
division cards. 
Marginal Indications 
Whatever the sort of bibliographical note in 
process, or for that matter subject note either, it 
is well to have a little margin at the left of the 
slip or card. One thing that can be put there is 
the date of making the note. To be able to see the 
sequence in one’s accumulations or thinking on any 
40 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES 
matter is very often a great help. The record 
therefor can be made in some abbreviated way, 
and is worth while for at least all important notes. 
Another item for the margin, especially in a gen- 
eral bibliographical note, is the call number for 
the material in question in a library or other in- 
stitution where one is working, or possibly expects 
to be working. The margin is a good place too 
for at least part of the informational or critical 
jottings one may care to make, in considering at 
any time what is stated in the note. Constant 
verifying of one’s work is essential, persistent 
comparing or collating of what is put down with 
the source or writing used, to see that everything 
is noted—names, dates, titles, pages, all such data 
as well as the matter itself—is reproduced accu- 
rately. Whether this was done, and when, can be 
told on the margin. Illustration of these various 
uses of the margin may be seen in the Examples 
at the end.

SUBJECT NOTES 
Subject, Provenience, and Location of What is 
Noted 
O construct a subject note most serviceably, 
one should first have in mind very clearly to 
what the note is to relate; and what is to be noted 
should always have a single point or theme. The 
point or theme may be very small, limited say to 
such a matter as the price of a measure of wheat, 
in 1250 possibly, or 1920; or it may be very large, 
like the challenge of Luther at Worms, or a deci- 
sion of the peace conference at Versailles in 1919; 
or as ramified as the relations of pope and emper- 
or in the time of Innocent III, or the causes of 
the American Revolution. Less than the space on 
a small slip may be required for the noting, or sev- 
eral or many slips in a series may be needed; or 
1Many hold that small slips or cards ought never to be used in 
series, that when such materials are employed one should expect 
each note to occupy no more than a single slip or ecard. The 
writer does not subscribe to this, but is willing to regard it as 
among the matters on which individual workers may differ, more 
or less reasonably. He will only urge that in the light of his 
experience, to bar the use of small slips in series, paged consec- 
utively, would be to subtract greatly from their usefulness. 
42
-P-A-G-E-49
SUBJECT NOTES 
even one or more sheets of considerable size. 
Large or small, simple or complex, no subject note 
should be made whose matter, or proposed matter, 
cannot be seen in terms of one point or theme. 
And provision should be made, in each such 
note, for telling what the subject is. Space some- 
where at the top of the slip or sheet, where the 
eye will fall the moment the note is in sight, must 
be reserved for this purpose. Doubtless many a 
worker would find, as his experience lengthened, 
that he did not care always to put down the sub- 
ject; that in a good many circumstances indeed 
he preferred not to do so. But the space therefor 
should be kept reserved just the same. 
Concerning omission of the subject-label: what- 
ever practices in that way may seem reasonable 
under some circumstances to an experienced 
worker, the beginner at least should better ad- 
here strictly to the plan of setting down the sub- 
ject, and setting it down exactly. He can thus test 
effectively his ability or skill in singling out a 
“‘fact,’’? or statement, or point, and keeping his 
note strictly thereto. The effort to be exact in this 
matter may not at first seem worth while for 
every case. It may look convenient and sufficient 
to label what one writes as Geographical, or Po- 
litical, or perhaps Religious or Intellectual. Such 
labels however are general, not specific. They

  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
are very useful in their place; but their place is 
not the space reserved on a slip or sheet for indi- 
eating the subject of a note. What should be put 
there is, in as few and definite words as possible, 
an indication of just what the note is about di- 
rectly, immediately; particularly, not generally. 
Still another point here: a subject-label is meant 
to show or identify the matter on which the note 
is made; it is not meant to prescribe on what the 
note may be used. A note concerning a particular 
matter might be usable on a great number of 
subjects. Certainly this is true of a long note, in 
the course of which are several heads or themes 
and possibly more or less data or discussion on 
each of them. But even a brief note, very limited 
as well as single in content, might be made to ap- 
ply at several points in the course of.a study or bit 
of composition. Here, by the way, appears one 
office for cross-reference slips or cards: to indicate 
that a given matter is treated in a note or notes 
elsewhere. 
Along with such pains about the subject, from 
the outset on a subject note, should go care con- 
cerning the source or provenience of what is to be 
noted—the authority to be represented as imme- 
diately, or directly, responsible for it. In many 
instances the real provenience may not be known, 
or even knowable; or the provenience ascribed 
44 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
SUBJECT NOTES 
may be open to suspicion. What is set down will 
have to be indicated as Anonymous, or as Uncer- 
tain. In a great number of cases the provenience, 
at least the ostensible provenience, can be speci- 
fied as such and such a person or group or organi- 
zation, in this or that document or work done at 
such or such a date. In still other cases of great 
number the direct source will be, or at any rate 
ought to be, the maker of the note; relying pos- 
sibly on something he can indicate, say a certain 
document, or some work by so or so. Whatever 
the particular circumstances, the provenience of 
every bit noted should be determined as definitely 
and surely as possible, and indicated correspond- 
ingly. 
The best place for the indication is undoubtedly, 
as for the subject-label, somewhere at or near the 
top of the slip or sheet used. There is where it 
can be seen most conveniently. And in no cireum- 
stances should one’s findings as to the direct pro- 
venience be omitted. 
Once more, when making a subject note one 
should locate the matter ‘in question, as nearly as 
may be, and perhaps indicate the location in a 
special way. What is primarily essential here, 
for at least most of the phenomena of human af- 
fairs, is their social location—their where and 
when in a given society. Who had such or such an 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
idea? Just who shared in this or that event? 
What were the bounds socially of such or such a 
custom or usage, the extent socially of this or that 
condition? 
Very often it will not be possible, at the moment 
of making a note, to have a really advantageous 
answer for such a question—an answer at once 
definite and accurate. Usually, however, one can 
at least see some more or less inclusive group to 
which the matter may conveniently be attached. 
For example, certain practices as to trade or some 
notable happening may be seen as taking place in 
the urban community of Rouen, though just what 
persons or groups carried them on may still be 
to know. Usually also one can see some period 
of time, more or less inclusive,—the 12th century 
for instance, or perhaps 1160-1170, or maybe 1160 
—within which the practices or the notable hap- 
pening occurred, though the exact year or month 
or day be yet undetermined. Some custom or 
event—say of the French Revolution or of the 
American Civil War—in which the actors are only 
meagerly visible may be seen anyway as part of 
the life of the people of France, or possibly of 
Paris, for instance in 1793; or of the people 
of America, or possibly of the Confederacy, or of 
Richmond, say in 1864. And such groups can be 
designated conveniently by terms of place: 
46
-P-A-G-E-53
  SUBJECT NOTES 
strictly, one may better think ‘‘people of Rouen,’’ 
or ‘‘people of France,’’ or ‘‘people of Paris,’’ or 
‘people of America,’’ or ‘‘people of Richmond’’; 
but the brief, handy label will be Rouen, or France, 
or Paris, or United States, or Richmond. 
Whether the answers about location be definite 
or only approximate, it will not always seem es- 
sential to put all of the items down in a special or 
separate way. In many circumstances either the 
particular person or persons concerned, or the 
time factor, or both of these points, may be ap- 
parent enough from the statement of provenience, 
or the statement of subject, or the two together. 
In other circumstances it may look inconvenient 
to label a note for some general group when its 
matter should clearly be useful for a number of 
groups. Nevertheless in every subject note there 
should be a special place for telling who (or the 
equivalent where) and when. In at least a great 
share of instances the information will need to be 
recorded formally. And the proper place, as for 
the items about subject and provenience, is some- 
where at or near the top of the slip or sheet. 
But in what manner at the top should the data 
on subject, provenience, and location be placed, 
or distributed? Opinions about this differ a good 
deal, and probably always will. One plan very 
often followed is to reserve the upper left hand 
47
-P-A-G-E-54
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
corner for location (place first, and the time be- 
low it); give all the space at the right thereof to 
the subject, and indicate provenience just below 
the subject: 
England Rural occupations in winter evenings 
13 cent. 
Prothero (R. E.), English Farming Past and Present 
(1912), 29-30: 
Some who use this plar like to have lines on the 
slip as follows: 
England | Rural occupations winter evenings 
13 cent.     
Prothero (R. E.), Engl. Farming Past and Present 
(1912), 29-30: 
By another plan the location (or at least the time 
factor in it) is given at the left, the provenience 
next, and the subject at the right: 
13 cent. Prothero (R. E.), Engl. Farming Past Rural occu- 
and Present (1912), 29-30 pations win- 
ter evenings 
The plan that seems most convenient to the pres- 
ent writer is to give the upper left hand corner 
to location (place first and below it time, as in 
the first plan mentioned), then immediately to 
the right of that but with the line of expansion 
down rather than across the page put the subject, 
and to the right of that the provenience (see Ex- 
amples at end, beginning with number 31). Modi- 
fication of any one of these plans is of course 
48
-P-A-G-E-55

possible so as to indicate the time over in the 
right hand corner. 
Probably almost any arrangement that makes 
due provision for all the items involved and 
groups them at the top of the slip or sheet may 
be made to serve effectively as label of a subject 
note. But at least this may be said for the plan 
followed in the Examples at the end: it leaves no 
manner of doubt in the first purpose of such a 
label, which is to distinguish the note as subject, 
and not bibliographical. It makes the distinction 
perfectly clear even if one uses the subject-biblio- 
graphical sort of note (in which the best place for 
subject indication is also at the top, but from left 
to right). The plan used in the Examples is per- 
fectly clear also in the next purpose of such a la- 
bel: it shows at sight whether the maker of the note 
is to be regarded as directly responsible for what 
is set down and if not just who or what else is the 
direct source—if that is really specifiable. 
Subject Notes to Represent Another, or Others 
Let it be assumed then that a subject note is in 
process and that the author thereof is keen con- 
cerning its subject, provenience, and location. 
Also the object for the moment is to show or care 
for something said or written by another, or oth- 
ers, than the maker of the note. 
49
-P-A-G-E-56
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
One may wish to quote in full, or at length. A 
writing, or perhaps some rather distinct portion 
thereof, may seem brief enough to permit such 
reproduction, considering its interest. Or the 
piece may seem so important that all of it, or pos- 
sibly all of some unit of it, ought to be put down, 
however long. Or if not exactly all, then all with 
such omissions here or there as may seem per- 
missible. The omissions should of course be made 
judiciously, with due regard for the use to which 
the material noted is to be put. Where they occur 
ean usually be marked well enough by dots in line. 
With such things written down at length, or 
perhaps typed, may be associated many of the 
clippings, excerpts, circulars, and pamphlets one 
accumulates: pieces already down in full, only 
in print. To the degree these things relate to 
something other than sources of information, they 
will be treatable best as subject notes, which may 
be filed—rather than say as books, for shelves. 
And the problem will be, taking each piece as it is, 
simply to label it appropriately in the subject-note 
way; or after mounting or enclosing in a folder, 
to label the mounting piece or the folder. 
Commonly, in a subject note to represent an- 
other, a student will wish, not to quote or excerpt 
or file in full, but to reproduce—in full or in part 
—hby some sort of analysis. Quoting may still be 
50 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  SUBJECT NOTES 
in order, often indeed should be considered neces- 
sary. But when done it will be as incident or re- 
sult of analysis, rather than as the primary means. 
The analyzing may be of that primary kind 
describable as constructive. Every statement or 
group of statements oral or written there may be 
occasion to make note of, came from its author 
or authors in such or such a structure or form. 
The thing may have been done in orderly manner, 
or quite the contrary; it was at least done in some 
manner. To be as sure as possible of representing 
it faithfully, a hearer or reader should see the 
statement in the manner or form of its making, 
follow it along the structural track via which it 
was produced. Only so—from the inside of the 
head or heads responsible—can just interpreting 
of anything said or written be hopefully attemp- 
ted. This is but the more true in proportion 
as the talk or written piece is consecutive, or 
entailed. In other words a statement or writ- 
ing should be seen constructively. Then the lines 
of what is thus seen may be set down, if one 
wish, as a note. 
This kind of analysis is essential, to greater or 
less degree, for anything heard or read But it 
depends on circumstances whether the results

  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
better be set down in writing, as a note. This or 
that piece may be so short and clear, or so clear 
however long, that it would be waste of time and 
energy to write out its construction; the mind will 
manage it without such aid. Another piece, on the 
other hand, may be so thoughtful or complex 
that, whether long or even relatively brief, the 
interpretation once made out it might be real 
economy of time and energy to keep a written 
record thereof. 
Into how much detail a worker should go, if he 
sets down a constructive analysis, will vary with 
the extent to which individual workers find advan- 
tage therein. Probably most of those concerned 
will usually prefer to make such an analysis 
fairly ‘‘empty,’’ giving no more than may seem 
requisite for re-reading the matter in question 
quickly, or possibly bringing it back to mind with- 
out re-reading. It is well anyway to include indi- 
cation of the bounds of at least the main points. 
Some illustrations of such work, or of notes show- 
ing the results thereof, are given in Examples 31 
and following. 
What is this, it may be asked, but an outline? 
And are we not all practiced enough in outlining? 
True enough, such work may be regarded as an 
outline, as a more or less detailed table of con- 
tents. But it ought to be done far better than 
52
-P-A-G-E-59
SUBJECT NOTES 
many people seem able to do it. The essential 
point is to show just what was meant to be said 
in the piece concerned; to indicate accurately the 
main mental road or path followed, and the sub- 
roads and by-paths, with all points of division or 
junction: as nearly as possible as the author or 
authors saw these things—consciously or uncon- 
sciously—at the time of the authorship. A student 
is always in more or less danger, however, of 
representing what he thinks on his own account, as 
he reads the piece; in danger of giving an outline, 
not always of the other person’s mind, but more or 
less of his own mind. 
Or the analyzing may be of the abstractive kind. 
Very often the piece under consideration will 
be of such character that, for many if not most 
of a student’s purposes, much of it may just as 
well be passed over. This can easily be the case 
with a legal document drawn to include all the 
formulas or phrases deemed requisite. Or the 
circumstances may simply necessitate reduction to 
fewer words. Almost any statement or writing— 
that has some length anyway—can indeed be ex- 
pressed in shorter form, if attention only be cen- 
tered on its main points, or perhaps main point. 
With the pressure for reduction may likely go a 
wish or demand that the result read well, and not 
be just a jointed outline. A note done to read 
53
-P-A-G-E-60
  PRINCIPLES OF A a 
well is especially useful if printing is in view; its 
matter may be transferred to print with little or 
no further work. The abstracting process is fa- 
miliar enough through the use commonly made of 
it in analyses of scientific articles or works, digests 
of cases at law, and reports in the press of 
speeches and public documents. A few illustra- 
tions are given in Examples 35 and following. 
But oftentimes it may seem better to para- 
phrase, to represent by equivalent—and possibly 
extended—expressions rather than by abstracting. 
What is being considered may be compact with 
meaning, or done in figurative or technical lan- 
guage, by which much can be said in few words. 
Might the thought not be clearer if told with less 
concern for sparing words? The problem is likely 
to arise, say, as a worker quotes something in his 
own language. It is sure to come up in trans- 
lating from another language. It certainly is 
bound to appear frequently in abstracting, what- 
ever the language. 
Hither an abstract or a paraphrase requires use 
of expressions of one’s own: a serious obstacle to 
representing another justly. And with an abstract 
there is the additional risk of the short cut, the 
more risky possibly in proportion to the shortness. 
To proceed safely will often demand very special 
pains. It will be necessary to keep as close to at 
54
-P-A-G-E-61
  SUBJECT NOTES 
least the main path and frame of mind of the 
speaker or writer or group concerned, as for a 
complete constructive analysis. As far as pos- 
sible the very manner of expression employed by 
the person or group better be followed. Often 
even actual quotation should be made of the more 
significant or perhaps technical or uncertain words 
or statements, and possibly an explanation added 
on occasion. 
Or the analyzing may be in a selective way; at 
any rate in a way by which the note made will 
show selected matter. The problem in such case 
will usually be to choose and put down a single 
point; of large moment possibly or of very little 
moment, but a short bit from something longer. 
Sometimes however the circumstances will seem 
to call, not for recording one point or matter, but 
for putting down several in succession; for what 
may be called serial, rather than single-point, 
selection. 
To do either one point or a series of points 
trustworthily, the context of the bit or bits se- 
lected must be reckoned with. This may not mean 
much trouble if the talk or writing as a whole is 
light in thought, or is done in units that are more 
or less individual or defined and are clearly com- 
posed. It will mean mere trouble, and sometimes 
a great deal, if the ideas are at all elusive or inter- 
55
-P-A-G-E-62
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
woven, or told without special care for clear ex- 
pression. At any rate the first requisite will be 
an analysis of the constructive sort—possibly 
mental only, or also on paper—either of the piece 
as a whole or of as much of it as may be necessary 
for a just view of the perspective or setting of the 
part or parts considered. 
The setting once determined, note of the bit or 
bits selected should be made as nearly as possible 
in the exact words of the person or persons con- 
cerned. The record may be made of course, if 
circumstances seem to require, more or less in 
words of one’s own, and perhaps with abstracting 
or paraphrasing in addition. But the same care 
should then be taken as in abstracting or para- 
phrasing a longer bit. And the result reached 
should be regarded as possibly what the circum- 
stances permitted, not what the ideal strictly re- 
quired. The guiding principle should remain: the 
nearer to quotation the better. For illustrations 
see Example 41 and following. 
Of course when quoting is done, either of a 
writing as a whole or of only some part or parts 
of it incidental to analysis of some sort, the 
language used should be that of the piece con- 
cerned. If the language happens to be ‘‘foreign,’’ 
the worker may add whatever keys he thinks help- 
ful toward exact expression of the same matter 
in his own language: translation for instance, in 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
SUBJECT NOTES 
full or part, or explanations—say following the 
quotation, or on the margins, or between the lines, 
or on the back of the slip or sheet. A translation 
of a writing, once well done, may serve many pur- 
poses. But notes for serious studies showing mat- 
ter from another language simply in translated 
form would—to say the least—not offer their 
maker the means of testing his interpretation, and 
possibly improving it, when using the notes later. 
Subject Notes to Represent their Author 
Suppose again a subject note is in process. But 
the student wishes now to represent himself, 
wishes to tell something for which the authority 
or source to be indicated as directly responsible 
is the maker of the note. 
He may for example have just taken part in 
or been witness of some event or customary act of 
which he would keep record, or on which he would 
comment. Or possibly he would write down from 
memory some experience he had in the past, and 
include reflections here or there that might seem 
fitting. Or perhaps, looking into the life of some 
individual or group by aid of relevant data or 
“‘facts,’’ he would point out a causal relation or 
interpretative thread he thinks perceptible there- 
in. Or maybe, grown master in affairs of some 
sort, or wise generally, he would record such dis- 
cussing or concluding as his mastery or wisdom 
57 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
seemed at the moment to justify. Things thus 
original or personal with the worker, any knowl- 
edge or thinking fully or independently his,—be 
it of large significance or small, very new or quite 
old,—ought certainly to be shown as coming from 
that worker himself. 
At other times what a student arrives at will 
not be so originally or independently his; yet still 
ought properly to be regarded as his, and so 
treated if a note is made. He may for instance 
hear, from one or several persons, something that 
he considers more or less acceptable, on their 
authority. Or he may read in a document or ar- 
ticle or book, or in a number of such things, some- 
thing he thinks probably or possibly or surely 
true, on the authority of the author or authors in 
question. He is interested enough, let us say, to 
digest and reéxpress the matter in his own words, 
and to put it down with such qualifying as ap- 
pears advisable and with due mention of the 
source or sources drawn upon. Doing thus he 
does not restrict himself simply and purely to try- 
ing to record what another said or thought. He 
brings in, to at least some degree, an attitude or 
point or view or digest of his own. His note ac- 
cordingly should be done with just cognizance of 
this, should be drawn, that is, so as to represent 
not another but the worker himself. 
58
-P-A-G-E-65
  
SUBJECT NOTES 
The ascribing to one’s self, on whatever ground, 
should be made clear from the very outset. As 
means thereto some may prefer to write their own 
name, or at least their initials, at the customary 
place for indicating provenience. Many more will 
think it sufficient simply to omit in such case any 
formal statement of the direct provenience. This 
of course will be on the understanding that such 
omission signifies the author of the note is im- 
mediately responsible—is at least the immediate 
channel of what is set down. The writing of one’s 
own name with possibly monotonous frequency 
can thus be avoided; and at the same time the way 
is opened to a quite distinctive form for a note of 
the sort. Proceeding so, there never need be any 
difficulty in recognizing, the moment the eye falls 
on a slip or sheet, not simply whether the note is 
of the bibliographical or of the subject sort, but | 
as well whether one’s self is represented or some 
other. 
Still another way of proceeding when one would 
indicate one’s self as directly responsible, is to 
write the other way on the slip or sheet. This pro- 
vides a specially distinctive form, or manner. 
Possibly most of those who adopt it will prefer to 
restrict its use to the cases when a worker would 
be setting down something for which he was origi- 
nally responsible—information or discussion of 
59
-P-A-G-E-66
  
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
which he himself should be regarded as solely the 
author, not as reproducer or reéxpresser or par- 
tially the author. 
Whatever practice one may adopt on this prob- 
lem, it is desirable to include indication of the 
source, or sources, of information on which one 
has relied—in so far as such may be specifiable. 
And the appropriate place for the indication is at 
the end, rather than beginning, of what is noted. 
Many students will think it best also to enclose 
each such indication in parentheses. By so doing 
they can mark a bit more plainly that the refer- 
ence given is not the direct provenience, but the 
authority—or source of information—on which 
the maker of the note rested for what he set down. 
The substance to be shown in a subject note 
representing one’s self will, of course, vary ac- 
cording to the worker’s requirements. Very often 
it will be a single point or matter, that can be put 
conveniently on one slip or card. Sometimes there 
will be a series of points or matters, which may or 
may not go on one slip, even by using the back 
thereof; may indeed extend to several slips. Oc- 
casionally what is in hand may be simply a sketch, 
or abstract; but in this case of something in the 
mind of the worker himself, not something another 
has said or written. Not infrequently the matter 
better be in the form of a constructive outline; for 
instance in the planning of a talk or article or 
60 
   
-P-A-G-E-67
  
SUBJECT NOTES 
book. Certainly what is to be set down will 
often be something in full, or in extenso, by writ- 
ing or type; some at least will wish to do even 
their more formal composing in this manner. II- 
lustrations of suitable practice for such notes are 
given in Examples 51 and following. 
Which Kind, when a Choice is Possible 
Beginners at least will often be wondering, 
which of the two general types of subject note 
should be used, that representing another or that 
representing one’s self. About the things thought 
and said originally or independently by one’s self, 
no question will be possible; there can be only one 
way of treating them. But about statements rest- 
ing more or less on others, experience will soon 
show that it depends much on the worker’s choice 
which plan is followed. Can any guiding principle 
be suggested about where to draw the line? 
One answer commonly urged for this is: be rid 
as much as may be of representing others; when 
at all possible, make notes to represent one’s self. 
And the argument runs rather convincingly. Any- 
thing said or written by another that a student 
would utilize for any purpose, must first be made 
his own. But if a matter is left in the form in 
which it was stated by another, there may remain 
a good deal of work to get that matter said appro- 
priately in words of one’s own. Let it be turned

forthwith then, before any note at all is made of 
it, into some form due to the maker of the note. 
In that way an inquirer can do his work, in a 
fashion, as he goes. He quarries the material as 
he comes to it. The expression found at first, the 
style in which the record is made, may not be as 
he would wish. But what is set down—whether 
worked over entirely from some other or con- 
tributed partly by the maker of the note, whether 
expressed wholly in his own words or perhaps 
with the aid of some quotation—is at least one 
form in which the worker is able to complete, or 
finish up, making the matter in question really 
his. 
The point is good, within limits. But if turned 
into a sort of general motto, notes done under its 
command may frequently prove of very little help 
toward realizing the original setting of what was 
noted. For safe interpreting it may be necessary 
to return to the document or work concerned. 
Suppose for example a student once read atten- 
tively the account by Robert the Monk of Pope 
Urban II’s speech at Clermont,’ and made several   1The standard edition of the work in which Robert’s account 
occurs is in Recueil des Historiens des Croisades: Historiens Occi- 
dentaux, III (Paris, 1866), page 727 and following. For a capable 
English version of the parts referred to here, see D. C. Munro, in 
University of Pennsylvania, Translations and Reprints from the

ing; or A. C. Krey, The First Crusade, 30-32.

notes thereon. Suppose further that one of these 
notes runs, with exception of the labels: 
Pope Urban II, at Clermont, pictured Syria as a 
rich country, worth considering as a place for con- 
quest. 
Is this though, just as it stands, likely to convey 
on coming before the eye afterward, a fair idea 
of what Robert represented the pope as saying at 
the point in question? Reference to the account 
itself should show in fact that the broad. funda- 
mental ground on which Robert thought the pope 
based his appeal, was Christian duty. The people 
of France especially, with their valorous record in 
behalf of the faith, should feel obliged now to 
rescue the land where Christ had lived and died: 
they should think of it as God’s will. Did some of 
them object though on account of property or 
family ties? In that case they should, for one 
thing, reflect on the richness and abundance in the 
region to be won. But such reading gives a very 
different impression from what the note by itself 
might convey. There is a chance at least of the 
note’s leading one considerably from the main 
track of the pope’s mind. 
Another of the notes, let us say, reads: 
Urban IT, at Clermont, advocated the crusade as 
a remedy for over-population.

Was his point then as if he said, in a vein of the 
nineteenth century: the western world is over- 
populated; let us have a war abroad? Recurring 
to the original it would appear that what the pope 
was represented as saying mainly, at this place in 
his address, was of other tenor. Conquest against 
infidels in the east—so his meaning seems—would 
be a far better occupation for Christian soldiers 
than fighting among yourselves here at home, as 
you do—there being too many of you to live peace- 
fully. Not over-population as such then, and as a 
special theme, but a crowded condition in Europe’s 
fighting class as explanation, incidentally, of a lot 
of civil or private strife for which the pope urged 
substitution of a holy war in foreign parts. The 
note, by itself, is really untrustworthy. It is not 
simply deceptive as to the main track of Robert 
the Monk’s representation of Pope Urban’s think- 
ing, but besides insidious with a view about mod- 
ern peoples widely sustained in recent times. 
These examples, it may be argued, were not 
well done to start with: really capable work would 
result more accurately. Let this be granted. 
Nevertheless they illustrate not unfairly some of 
the pitfalls in the way of every beginner who 
would—if at all possible—set down things so as 
to represent himself. And for that matter, the 
writer often meets with statements in articles or 
64 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  SUBJECT NOTES 
books by experienced students which seem to be 
based on just such ambiguous or inaccurate notes 
as the two just discussed. 
There is still another pitfall. Even if the maker 
of a note succeeded in getting down trustworthily 
in his own words something said by another, in 
the process of restatement the life of the original 
may slacken, or perhaps quite vanish. 
For one brief example, the message to the public 
left by the explorer Scott, as he faced inevitable 
death in the Antarctic regions in 1912, reads 
toward the end: ‘‘Things have come out against 
us... . But if we have been willing to give our 
lives to this enterprise, which is for the honour of 
our country, I appeal to our countrymen to see 
that those who depend on us are properly cared 
for. Had we lived I should have had a tale to tell 
of the hardihood, endurance, and courage of my 
companions which would have stirred the heart of 
every Englishman. These rough notes and our 
dead bodies must tell the tale, but surely, surely 
a great, rich country like ours will see that those 
who are dependent on us are properly provided 
for.’? Suppose note has been made of this as fol- 
lows (the labels excepted) : 
Captain Scott appealed to the public to care for 
those who were dependent on him and his com- 
panions. 
65
-P-A-G-E-72
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
How lifeless the restatement is, in comparison 
with the original! How little its chance of con- 
veying, after a little time has passed, a realizing 
image of the courage and hope beating in the 
words as written! 
And if a worker has thousands of such notes 
—has the habit of redigesting and reéxpressing 
things in this fashion,—how far may he be habitu- 
ally from seeing and portraying human things 
with real exactness? For it is possible to miss the 
truth in such things quite as much by leaving out 
the life accompanying utterances and written 
statements as by being ambiguous or inaccurate in 
their interpretation. 
Mindful of such pitfalls, some will incline to 
say that the documents or works should themselves 
be at hand, and be utilized directly, without the 
medium of notes. But this, while a safe and ideal 
plan, is not always necessary, and certainly is 
often impracticable. Most of us will think that, 
after all, reliance must be placed to a very large 
extent on notes. 
In that case however the answer about which 
kind to employ better read: in making notes, pro- 
ceed so as to be as sure as possible of utilizing a 
source or work with due understanding of just 
what the author said. And this ought to mean in 
practice, for at least a great share of the notes 
66 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
  
SUBJECT NOTES 
made, elimination of any attempt to work over 
and reéxpress in a manner to represent one’s self. 
Where the matters dealt with happen to be quite 
impersonal or objective, and perhaps are treated 
in terms correspondingly impersonal and unmis- 
takably clear, there may be no risk in the working 
over, and real convenience may advise that course. 
But where such things as motives, conceptions, 
opinions and emotions are in view, or acts highly 
charged therewith, and perhaps especially telling 
or close-fitted expressions are used, whose mean- 
ing is peculiarly in their interrelations, the more 
advantageous plan will likely be: try purely and 
simply to show, by quotation or analysis, the men- 
tal track of the author or authors concerned—do, 
that is, a note of the type to represent another. 
Proceeding thus a worker will often find it im- 
possible to finish as he goes; sometimes indeed 
will be leaving a good deal of the work to the time 
of treating the material constructively. But any 
disadvantage there may be in that should be ac- 
cepted, wherever gain is possible in either trust- 
worthiness or vitality. Besides, such notes once 
made will be of the greatest possible service in 
any direct use that may seem requisite later of the 
documents or works to which they apply. 
67

CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
HE matter one gathers in the form of notes 
may become in course of time of great quan- 
tity; certainly so with the serious worker. It will 
at least drop largely out of mind. Some way of 
classifying and preserving the notes, or of filing, 
is requisite; some plan by which they may be dis- 
posed of conveniently, found again easily, and 
manipulated with advantage in any inquiry one 
may have in hand. 
Material Means 
Obviously in such a plan there must be some 
special means of a material sort. Receptacles of 
suitable kind, in which to put and keep the notes, 
are of course essential. And it is imperative to 
have division marks, for convenient indication of 
whatever separations or groupings among the 
notes may seem desirable. 
As for the receptacles, the problem is simple 
enough. If one has settled upon slips or sheets 
of a usual or standard size—3x5 for instance, or 
4x6, or 814x1l—drawers or cases appropriate 
therefor can readily be found in the market. To 
68
-P-A-G-E-75
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
be sure, the cases obtainable in the market are 
likely to be thought by many students too expen- 
sive, often prohibitively expensive. But at little 
or no outlay boxes can be made, or found, that will 
serve the purpose at least temporarily. 
For division marks it is best to employ, in the 
main, cards of some sort, or sorts. The cards 
should be thick or heavy enough to resist wear, 
and to keep thin slips or sheets standing up firmly ; 
yet not so thick as to consume space unnecessarily. 
They should stand also a little higher in the case, 
say three or four sixteenths of an inch, than the 
notes they are dividing or supporting. They may 
very well too be of different colors, cards of one 
color designating say the main groupings or sec- 
tions erected; of another color, bibliographical 
notes; of another, the customary general subdivi- 
sions among subject notes; of still another, this 
or that special kind of material or subdivision 
among subject notes. And within the bounds of 
any color it may seem convenient to employ dis- 
tinctions in thickness, or modifications of shape 
(like clipping off one corner, or possibly both 
corners). 
History in a Plan for All Subjects 
The plan for notes in history, whatever its fea- 
tures materially or otherwise, should be part of a 
69
-P-A-G-E-76
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
comprehensive plan covering in one way or an- 
other all fields. 
The first main division or unit of the compre- 
hensive plan should better be of a sort to take in 
anything, without obligation as to any kind of 
arrangement: a compartment open and accommo- 
dating enough to be given some such name as 
UNCLASSIFIED (or possibly MISCELLANE- 
OUS). A student cannot always take the time to 
put notes, as he makes them, in the particular 
spots that might seem most suitable—to find for 
them the most appropriate definite quarters. 
Yet it is at least some sort of order to have a spe- 
cial place for things that are not to be regarded as 
‘in order,’’? where such things may be put tem- 
porarily. A main division like this at the open- 
ing is likely to prove useful even if one comes to 
have lesser sections of the same kind farther 
along. 
Next in the comprehensive plan should come 
several GENERAL SERIES: units in which there 
would be some principle of arrangement—some 
sort of series—yet not restriction as to any special 
subject or field. 
Among the possibilities here is a series that 
could be labeled GrNERAL: AUTHORS, TITLES, SUB- 
gEcTs; or more briefly, GENL: AUTHORS AND SUB- 
gects. Into this would go any sort of material 
70 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
treatable as notes, written or printed: both bits 
giving information about any author or work, and 
those telling on this or that subject what either 
others or one’s self has said. The pieces entered, 
whether about authors or subjects, would be mar- 
shaled together in one alphabetical line: according 
to names or labels either on the notes themselves 
or on division cards and folders. But if desired, 
data about authors and works dealing with a 
given subject could be assembled in some distine- 
tive way at the point where the subject in ques- 
tion appeared—that is, behind the main slip or 
division-mark on that subject. 
This type of general series, used so widely in 
catalogues of libraries, will doubtless commend 
itself to many students. To many, also, it will 
seem too inclusive. Certainly if pieces lodged 
therein become at all numerous their manipulation 
is likely to be slow, and perhaps bunglesome. 
Another possible general series is one for which 
the name By auTHor could be used. In this too, 
should the student wish, might go any materials 
whatsoever, all pieces about subjects as well as 
those about authors; though the filing would be 
only according to author. But again, generous 
use would likely entail inconvenience of manipu- 
lation. To make such a series worth while, most 
students will probably think, it should be limited 
71
-P-A-G-E-78
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
to pieces which, however miscellaneous in subject, 
had some character in common that made separate 
grouping look convenient—say articles and other 
smaller writings in pamphlet form. 
The sorts of general series likely to be found 
most useful are two between which all the ma- 
terials concerned may be divided. Into one should 
go only pieces giving information about authors 
and works. The arrangement would of course 
be by author and work, with all materials pertain- 
ing to a given author or work filed after the mark 
or card therefor (in appropriately made notes 
this would be assured by their labeling). And an 
appropriate name would be GENL: BIBLIOGRAPHICAL. 
Into the other series should go, primarily, pieces 
of the subject sort; and any bibliographical bits 
inserted should be filed, not at the points in the 
alphabet their own names might give them, but as 
materials on the subjects to which they related. 
For all this an appropriate label would be cznu: 
BY SUBJECT. 
In the comprehensive plan again, ample pro- 
vision should be made for materials on various 
SPECIAL SUBJECTS OR FIELDS. The chief 
place of course in the historical student’s arrange- 
ments as to notes will be for notes in the field of 
history. But such a student, as his work develops, 
will be concerned, from interest or need, with a 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
good many matters besides history too intensively 
to be able to house his accumulations conveniently 
in any sort of ‘‘general’’ series. Even if he should 
devote himself to history quite single-heartedly 
—worship as it were at Clio’s shrine only—he 
must still specialize more or less on numerous 
other things. 
One way of meeting this problem, or meeting 
it in a measure, is to pick out such lots of material 
as would seem from their subjects to promise 
rather direct or very special assistance in histori- 
eal study and then, instead of lodging these in 
say the general subject series, group or append 
them in a separate or distinctive manner some- 
where or somewheres under history—with the 
label say of ‘‘Auxiliary Sciences’? (or perhaps 
“Special Aids’’). The materials so treatable 
would surely include notes on bibliography; on 
libraries, archives, and museums; on such matters 
as diplomatics, paleography, epigraphy, archx- 
ology, numismatics. One might arrange to include 
too notes about geography; or about this or that 
language; or data concerning such sciences as 
psychology, sociology, economics, or political 
science. 
But such procedure has shortcomings. At least 
many students, even though inclined to use an 
‘“‘auxiliary’’ section or sections a good deal, will 
73 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
    PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
prefer, as main reliance in their chief interests or 
needs outside of history, a series or set of com- 
partments frankly for special subjects or fields. 
Only thus, they may think, is it possible to have 
really comfortable accommodations for many mat- 
ters to which either interest or need draws them 
considerably. Simply to classify them with, or 
append them in some way to, history results in 
serious cramping rather than convenience. 
Among such matters may be, for example, some 
natural sciences other than geography or psychol- 
ogy; or some of the applied sciences, like engineer- 
ing or medicine; or the social sciences for other 
reasons than simply their aid to history; or such 
large interests as education, the fine arts, and 
philosophy. 
Whatever the number of special subjects ar- 
ranged for, there will of course be the problem, as 
to each such subject: how should the grouping or 
classifying of materials thereunder be carried on? 
The answer must depend very much on the cir- 
cumstances of the student—particularly the time 
at his disposal, and the scope or quality of his in- 
terest. It should at least always be possible, no 
matter what the subject, to do as just suggested 
for the several ‘‘general’’ series; employ, that is, 
distinctions of a purely conventional or artificial 
sort. This would give in each case, one or more 
14
-P-A-G-E-81
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
compartments or units for which the appropriate 
labels would be: Authors and Subjects; By Au- 
thor; Bibliographical; By Subject. But the more 
intelligent and intensive one’s cultivation of any 
subject or field got to be, the less would be his 
profit or satisfaction from such practice. He 
would see the need, increasingly, of finding out 
and applying principles of distinction and classi- 
fication dictated by the nature of the matter stud- 
ied or by the objects to be accomplished with it. 
Eventually at least he would be proceeding, say, 
in reference to sociology or economics or political 
science, not just as in, say, the field of physics, or 
chemistry, or geography, or psychology. 
Within Field of History: .According to Location 
Within the special field of history to proceed 
with most advantage one should have provision 
first for classifying material according to loca- 
tion. A historical quest, as has been recalled once 
or twice already in these pages, must usually have 
as part of its object to know who were concerned. 
The varied phenomena that may be noted about 
human things, and all the conclusions reachable 
on such things, are to be regarded as involving, 
whatever else, either some person or some persons 
more or less numerous; sooner or later as definite 
answer as may be possible has to be found for the 
75  
-P-A-G-E-82
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
question, what person? or what group or lot of 
people? And the simplest way of distinguishing 
between groups or measuring the social range of 
this or that within any lot of people is to use 
place-terms. 
At the same time, the search for social location 
cannot always be made, or at least completed, 
forthwith. With regard to a great percentage of 
materials it may look, at a given moment, either 
too difficult or too inconvenient. What is more 
serious, the answer may be variable. Many things 
will be of so small scope, or at all events one’s 
interest in them will be so singly concerned with 
some individual or some very limited group, that 
it will seem appropriate to associate them only 
with the person or group in question. Many other 
things however will seem associable with more 
than one person or group, often indeed with many 
groups or lots of people. Magna Carta, for ex- 
ample, may find place in both the general group 
England and many local groups within England; 
and also, either through its origins or its conse- 
quences or both, in very numerous other groups 
beyond England. A student’s procedure then 
must be such as to fit in helpfully with so varying 
conditions. 
The only feasible course, under the circum- 
stances, is—with reference to any given bit of 
76 
   
-P-A-G-E-83
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
material—either to pick out the group which it 
may be thought to concern, or to have concerned, 
chiefly or primarily; or to choose some unit or 
lot of people that may at least be considered large 
or widespread enough to include the group or 
groups or persons that ought really to be in view. 
The largest unit in such a plan will be that of 
the world. Some may think it would be well, for 
the accommodation of some matters, to have the 
universe as the largest unit. But the universe, 
in this connection, should be, or at least may be, 
regarded as but part of the natural environment 
in which the people of the world live and move 
and have their being. As sections, or groups, 
next to the world in size should be the several 
continents or other great areas: Africa; Ameri- 
eas; Asia; Pacific Area; Polar Areas; Western 
World (meaning the people who played their part 
in the Mediterranean basin and Europe and in 
course of time spilled over, with their civilization, 
into various other parts of the world). 
In these larger areas the grouping will go more 
according to racial and political lines. In the 
Americas, for instance, the larger divisions may 
be: America (British); America (Hispanic) ; 
America (United States). Among the larger di- 
visions in Asia should be China; India; Japan. 
Among those in the Western World: England+ 
77
-P-A-G-E-84
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
(that is England and greater Britain); France; 
Germany ; Southeastern Lands and Near Hast. 
Each such group or unit should be followed in 
turn by various grades of lesser units determined 
according to the circumstances. Under France, 
for example, would be the old provinces, like Nor- 
mandy; and under Normandy such a locality as 
Rouen or Caen, and in case of intensive study 
various sections of Rouen or Caen. Under United 
States, for another example, would come such sec- 
tions as New England, or the Middle West; and in 
each such section the states; and in the states sub- 
divisions as might be required, down to townships 
or school districts or even families and groups 
within families. 
However, in every such division by place or 
group special provision should be made, or at 
least should be regarded as makable, concerning 
persons. For inevitably the materials associable 
with any lot of people will in very great percentage 
be associable also, possibly primarily, with this 
or that individual. Even though a student’s in- 
terest may strictly be in the group concerned, his 
approach thereto may be through one or another 
particular life. And numerous individuals will 
properly appear in many groups: Dante for ex- 
ample, or Napoleon, or Washington, or Darwin, or 
Woodrow Wilson. It is best to have some uniform 
78
-P-A-G-E-85
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
or standard practice as to such materials. A plan 
for whose convenience the writer can vouch is to 
erect within any division by group or place where 
there seems need a special section, with a division- 
ecard labeled (at the left) for the group or place in 
view, ‘‘United States’’ for example, and next for 
“‘Persons’’ (or some equivalent expression, pos- 
sibly ‘Biographic’’; and in such section establish 
a subdivision for each person to be dealt with. 
Then the section for persons can always be 
located in series with two other uniformly ar- 
ranged sections soon to be described (those for 
events and habitudes). 
Proceeding so as to group and person, a student 
prepares appropriately for quests as to just who 
should be in view in any given matter; and thus 
makes the best of beginnings for quests of other 
sorts about the same matter. In addition he has 
at least some easily trackable lodging place for 
any material whatever—which alone is an indis- 
pensable service. 
Within Field of History: According to Kind 
Second in the historical field, one should have 
provision for classifying his materials according 
to the character or type ascribable to phenomena. 
Arrangement with reference to location is a use- 
ful beginning, but after all only a beginning. 
79
-P-A-G-E-86
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
Really to know understandingly any lot of people, 
or even any person, requires a great deal of social 
analyzing. And effective social analyzing calls 
for a careful, systematic plan; a plan including 
the points or questions to raise, and as well sec- 
tions or baskets in which to carry the materials 
for questioning and the answers or data arrived 
at. 
Events and Habitudes 
The foundational distinction to be made here is 
between phenomena that repeat or recur, and 
those that express or produce change. Many acts 
or psychic states of humans are as it were ar- 
ranged or prescribed to have sameness, or at least 
similarity, with others: collectivities of men—po- 
litical, economic or other, a state perhaps, or a 
manufacturing group, or a church—organize them- 
selves or systematize their functioning, and go on 
more or less as so organized or functioning for 
some period short or long. Many acts or psychic 
states too, though quite individual in the sense that 
their author is a single person, and not a collectiv- 
ity, are practically identical in character and form 
with innumerable acts or states of other single 
persons: home-ways for example, play-ways, ha- 
bitual attitudes and practices in business or public 
affairs, and in general all that is likely to be called 
80
-P-A-G-E-87
  
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
manners, usage, custom; one item of the kind we 
ean think of as ‘‘typical’’ of the others. But both 
of these sorts or lots of acts and states are very 
unlike say such an individual performance as the 
demonstration by Copernicus of the central posi- 
tion of our sun, or the invention of the telephone, 
or the writing of the Divine Comedy; very unlike 
also such a collective act or complex as say the 
formation and acceptance of a constitution for the 
United States, or the French Revolution, or the 
recent World War. After any such achievement 
or set of occurrences, the life in the midst of 
which it took place is different, or becomes differ- 
ent, possibly variously or comprehensively so. 
It is not meant that human affairs are made 
fundamentally of two distinct or segregate things: 
experience approves no such conclusion. Nor is it 
meant even that some phenomena exhibit likeness 
with others, and the rest do not: any known phe- 
nomenon present or past may be regarded in either 
way. The point rather is that humans, in actual 
life, exist in many ways, or do or think many 
things, that show mostly or primarily sameness or 
likeness to others; and they also are or do or 
think many things which, whatever the qualities 
of sameness or likeness, show besides—in one de- 
gree or another, often quite outstandingly— 
uniqueness or individuality. And this is the case 
81
-P-A-G-E-88
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
no matter how limited or how inclusive may be the 
arena concerned, as little as the life of a quite un- 
important person or as large as some nation, or 
say the western world, or the whole human group. 
Recognition of this, and provision correspond- 
ingly, are essential to competent social analysis. 
The happenings or complexes that appear sig- 
nificant because of their uniqueness or individual- 
ity may be made so many centers or units for ma- 
terials relating thereto, and each unit marked 
with some particular name suggested by the cir- 
cumstances. Then these units, with the pertinent 
materials, may be grouped separately, in some 
sort of series. Besides the particular names some 
expression will be needed to distinguish such phe- 
nomena in general, and to serve as caption, say 
on division-cards, of whatever separate groups or 
series may be created therefor. The name likely 
to serve best, in view of long usage alike by tech- 
nical workers and the general public, is ‘‘Events.’’ 
Similarly the happenings that seem of moment 
because of what they repeat or reproduce, with 
the materials pertinent thereto, may be assembled 
in separate units, each with a particular name; 
and the units arranged in groups or series. Names 
for the groups or series, as may soon appear more 
clearly, should be somewhat according to circum- 
stances. As distinguishing expression for such 
82
-P-A-G-E-89
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
phenomena or groups in general, some term like 
‘‘Habitudes’’ may serve, or possibly ‘‘Condi- 
tions,”’ or ‘‘Civilization’’ (in the most inclusive 
sense) ; or some narrower term may be stretched 
for the purpose, say ‘‘Institutions.’’ 
Suppose, for example, the United States is un- 
der consideration and one has notes on various 
outstanding matters in its history: (1) Declara- 
tion of independence, (2) George Washington, (3) 
Reconstruction of the constitution, (4) Ordinance 
of 1787, (5) Alexander Hamilton, (6) War of 
1812, (7) John C. Calhoun, (8) Compromise of 
1850, (9) Cotton growing, (10) Plantation life, 
(11) Battle of Gettysburg, (12) Supreme court, 
(13) Abraham Lincoln, (14) Soldiers’ pensions, 
(15) Government of Massachusetts, (16) Theo- 
dore Roosevelt, (17) County and township, (18) 
War against Germany, (19) Primary schools. It 
would be appropriate to place in a section or se- 
ries marked EVENTS, the materials on (1), (3), 
(4), (6), (8), (11), (18) ; and in a section or series 
marked INSTITUTIONS the materials on (9), 
(10), (12), (14), (15), (17), (19). Then the ma- 
terials on (2), (5), (7), (13), (16) might be put 
in a special section or series for PERSONS, after 
the plan explained at page 78; and possibly sepa- 
ration made, concerning each of the persons dealt 
with, between events and habitudes (or customs). 
83
-P-A-G-E-90
  
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
How all this might look in practice is shown in 
Example 61. 
Special Aspects 
But the phenomena in hand or in process about 
any given lot of people, or a given person, may 
not be viewable to best advantage simply as events 
and habitudes (or institutions). The habitudes 
anyway, and not unlikely the events, may easily 
be of considerable variety: surely so if the study 
made is at all inclusive. Progress in such case, 
alike in analyzing and in dealing with the results, 
will depend on seeing what the variety is, what 
phenomena may be regarded as of one sort and 
what of another. An inquirer should be in posi- 
tion, in regard to people or persons in this or 
that place, both to pose such questions and to 
group such items as might seem to relate to one 
or another side or aspect of the life considered; 
and under each larger side or aspect adopt such 
sections or sub-aspects as might seem at once fit- 
ting and convenient. 
The habitudes or the events concerning any 
group or person may be treated so. Or, any group 
or person may be approached according to spe- 
cial aspect, and the distinguishing between habi- 
tudes and events carried out under whatever as- 
pects or subdivisions thereof are adopted for 
84
-P-A-G-E-91
  
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
study. In what follews it is assumed that the 
latter course is the one taken. And it is assumed 
also that wherever sections for ‘‘Events’’? and 
‘“‘Habitudes’’ are set up, a similar section for 
‘*Persons’’ may be added if there is need; in the 
same manner as just suggested concerning a group 
or person in general (see pages 78 and 83, and 
Examples beginning with 61). 
Many things about a group or person may be 
thought of as physical environment, and called in 
general PHYSICAL, or possibly MATERIAL +. 
Of these some may pertain to the whole body of 
physical nature, to the universe more or less in its 
entirety, and seem groupable as cosmic. Many 
will refer quite specifically to the earth, and espe- 
cially to conditions on its surface, conditions due 
partly to the past experience of the earth but 
made chiefly of such factors as soil, water, flora, 
fauna and climate: for which crocraPHic may 
serve as name (or if division is made here part 
of such things may be called czotocic). Other 
items may pertain-to the organic or vital world

the abnormal (perhaps pathological). Others 
again while in general biologic may refer par- 
ticularly to man—to man as depicted by the physi- 
cal sides of anthropology, ethnology and ethnog- 
raphy: in brief, possibly, anrHRopotocic, or still 
more briefly ractau. Still others may pertain to 
the composition of a given group with regard to 
such matters as number of people, number of each 
sex, percentage of children, etc., and distribution 
according to residence—perhaps also according to 
other points (occupation for instance): in brief 
POPULATION, OF DEMOGRAPHIC. 
Many things, again, may be considered as PO- 
LITICAL: because concerned with what was 
thought and done toward the conduct of the more 
general interests of a given lot of people, with 
what happened through the sort of society to 
which in modern times we commonly give the 
name state. 
Much of the varied business or affairs of hu- 
mans from this point of view may be seen as pri- 
marily internal or domestic, much else as relat- 
ing chiefly to matters external or international; 
and use may be made, at least with reference to 
events, of some such captions as EVENTS: HOME, 
and EVENTS: FOREIGN (or INTERNATIONAL). Or 
again, all that pertains to some sort of political 
activity or interest—home, foreign, or both—may

be assembled separately, say as POLITICAL, LEGIS- 
LATIVE; OF POLITICAL, MILITARY; OY POLITICAL, 
JUSTICE; OF POLITICAL, FINANCE; OF POLITICAL, 
DIPLOMATIC. 
The habitudes of a political society will mean 
its structure and the customs or laws in accord 
with which people sought to carry on their busi- 
ness, public and private. These would better be 
given a specific name, say INSTITUTIONS AND LAW 
(or possibly rnstitutions+). They may be 
grouped together, if one wish, under political 
in general, in contrast of course to political events; 
or they may be distributed according to sort of 
political activity. In either case subdivisions may 
seem desirable. Such subdivisions, looked at as a 
whole, could run more or less as follows: Law, 
with attention to its channels of origin, studies 
and statements of the law, and then its doctrines 
in order—first possibly in the ‘‘Public’’ field, and 
after that in the field of ‘‘Private’’ (or ‘‘Civil’’) 
affairs (but any part of the doctrines would be 
transferable to a later subdivision) ; Government, 
with a place first it may be for ‘‘Law, Public,’’ in 
any case with sections for ‘‘Govt, Central’’ and 
whatever branches it may include, for ‘‘Govt, 
Local,’’? and then for whatever other sharers of 
governmental power the society concerned may 
have had—for instance ‘‘Seigniors’? and

*‘Church’’ and ‘‘Towns’’ in medieval times; Pri- 
vate (or Civil), with place first it may be for 
“Law, Private’’ (or ‘‘Civil’’), at all events with 
sections for ‘‘Sorts and Conditions of Men’’ 
(social classes of course, and woman, but also 
such groups or kinds as Jews, aliens, and corpo- 
rations), ‘‘Ownership and Possession’’ (as to 
land of course, and movable goods, but also 
incorporeal things), ‘‘Contract,’’ ‘‘Inheritance’’ 
(to whom rights descend, and in what shares, 
without will and with), ‘‘Family’’ (marriage, 
husband and wife, infancy and guardianship) ; 
Crime and Tort (unless provided for in con- 
nection with administration of ‘‘Justice,’’ un- 
der Government) ; Procedure (again, unless cared 
for under ‘‘Justice’’). 
Very numerous things may be denominated SO- 
CIAL: that is, may be regarded as referring in 
some way to distinctions or groupings within a 
body politic. Some may pertain to attachments 
developed for a particular locality or region, to 
PLACE GROUPS; or perhaps to KINSHIP GROUPS, espe- 
cially the family, and possibly the clan or gens; or 
perhaps to differences based on age or generation 
or sex, particularly the case in regard to woman. 
Some may concern groups distinguished by rank, 
or perhaps by racial and religious marks, and be 
gathered under the general] name of soctaL CLASSES 
88
-P-A-G-E-95
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
—with appropriate subsectioning according to 
circumstances (for example: Nobles, Clergy, 
Serfs; Jews, Moors, Conversos; or sometimes, 
Catholics and Protestants). Some may relate to 
groups based on occupation: possibly to raRMERS; 
or to 1npusTRIALs (with subgrouping according to 
craft); or to MANUFACTURERS, TRADERS+ (or BUSI- 
ness, if the single term will serve for the various 
sorts or groups engaged in manufacturing, trade, 
etc.) ; or to PROFESSIONS (Or PROFESSIONALS), doc- 
tors, lawyers, priests or preachers, professors, 
teachers, etc.; or to INTELLECTUALS (leaders, what- 
ever their rank or occupational connection, in in- 
quiry or artistic creation). Some may be about 
persons or people distinguished by Possxssions, 
the nicH (possibly of the millionaire order); or 
by the lack of possessions, the poor (or UNFORTU- 
nates) of various ilk and degree; or by attitude 
to society, the anTI-SOCIALS. 
Or various special kinds of things about such 
groups may be treated in subdivisions under so- 
cial. So may be done, for example, concerning 
relations between groups—within one body poli- 
tie or irrespective of such bounds—through travel, 
migration, societies, meetings, social centers, or 
otherwise; say under the name soctaL CIRCULATION, 
or possibly mnTeR-socian (by analogy with rnvER- 
NationaL under things political). So again, con- 
89
-P-A-G-E-96
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
cerning habits in reference to food, clothing, habi- 
tation, toilet, ceremonies, amusements, etc.: say 
with the caption LIFE, MATERIAL AND PRIVATE. So 
further, concerning standards or ideals by which 
people lived—what they deemed right or wrong, 
or at least thought of as ought to be, and their 
manners and attainments accordingly: in short 
perhaps, moras. So still further, concerning ef- 
forts against ill conditions in society—possibly 
through measures for public health (regulations 
as to sewage, housing, and factories), or appro- 
priate provision for old age: in brief possibly, 
SOCIAL WELFARE. 
A great lot of things may be regarded as ECO- 
NOMIC; as pertaining that is to relations of per- 
sons or people with their material environment, 
for private advantage, or public advantage, or 
both. Some materials here will concern espe- 
cially productive activities; possibly HuNTING AND 
FisHING; possibly acricuLtuRE (including singly 
or in some combination field-crops, stock-raising, 
dairying, poultry-raising, gardening, fruit-grow- 
ing); possibly ExTRacTIVE INDUSTRIES, in which 
case the reference may be to Forest Industries, or 
to Mineral Industries (quarries and wells, as well 
as mines); possibly manuracrures (and thereun- 
der for food, or clothing, or housing, or furniture, 
or implements and arms, etc.). Some will have to 
90

do especially with exchange; in such case may 
either be about TRANSPORTATION (by sea, or by some 
sort of interior road or channel), or relate in this 
or that way to commerce (the actual transfer of 
goods of course, and also operations of credit and 
speculation). Some again will concern especially 
DISTRIBUTION, and thereunder may refer to the 
case or situation from the point of view of Owner- 
ship, or from that of Possession or Use, or from 
that of Transmission (between the living, or to 
heirs). 
Many things pertaining to this or that person, 
or to such or such people, may be regarded as 
RELIGIOUS. Here there may be occasion to 
start with, as to a given body of people, for such 
broad distinctions as Christians; Jews; Moslems; 
Buddhists; Confucian; ete. Then distinctions will 
be requisite under each of these. As to Christians 
for example, much that is to be classified may per- 
tain to the BASTERN CHURCHES; much else to some 
church of the west, RomMaN CATHOLIC perhaps, or 
one of the Protestant or Reformed groups— 
LUTHERAN, PRESBYTERIAN, etc. Once some such 
more particular sort of religious group is in view, 
it may seem advantageous to proceed separately 
with one or another aspect thereof; as to the Ro- 
man Catholic church, for example: its chief central 
institution through so many centuries, the Papacy; 
91
-P-A-G-E-98
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
or its many organized expressions of asceticism, 
under some such caption as Monks and Monas- 
teries; or its varied réle in the secular field, 
possibly Temporal Power, or Political Relations; 
or its part as to ideals and ways of living, The 
Church and Morals. 
In very great percentage the things dealt with 
may be treated as INTELLECTUAL, in a large 
sense of that term. And here many items may 
be of sort to fit the caption epucationaL. They 
may pertain to the fundamental thinking or condi- 
tions by which, in a given place and time, the 
training of the next generation was governed—to 
be called possibly Educational Doctrine, ete. Or 
they may relate to the institutions by which the 
training was attempted, or perhaps to the studies 
employed: for which some such label as Schools 
and Curricula may serve. Or if it should seem 
preferable the items about education might be 
grouped according to grade or object of the work 
—say Primary, or Secondary, or Higher; General, 
or Professional; with appropriate subdivisions 
for each. 
Or the things intellectual may be of sort to be 
called in general Lincuistic on LitERaRy. In such 
case they may concern the symbols employed (by 
the person or body of people in view) for expres- 
sion of thoughts and feelings, for medium of ex- 
92

change in talk or writing: in short Language and 
Writing, with due provision as well for the actual 
phenomena of such sort as for the science thereof. 
Or the reference may be to matters Literary: pos- 
sibly in the all-embracing sense of anything let- 
tered; or possibly in the more restricted sense of 
Literature, writings in some form of ‘‘Prose’’ or 
some form of ‘‘Poetry,’’ with a more or less indi- 
vidual or esthetic stamp; or may be in the sense 
of Literary Study, pursuit in one way or another, 
interpretatively and perhaps critically, of the 
tracks of creators of literature. 
Or the matters in view under intellectual may 
Concern SOCIAL STUDIES, science of some sort about 
men in society: possibly History, with eye. pri- 
marily for persons and groups (large or small, 
large even as humanity in general) particularly; 
or perhaps Sociology, with generalizing interest 
in group phenomena; or Political Science, in- 
volved mostly with government (chief mark of 
a state) and various sorts of public law, municipal 
(constitutional or administrative) and interna- 
tional; or Jurisprudence, occupied with the fun- 
damentals in law whether public or private; or 
Ethics (ethics as a science rather than as a branch 
of philosophy); or Economics, dealing with ma- 
terial welfare. 
The things intellectual, again, may pertain to 
93
-P-A-G-E-100
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
the screnczs, to interests or inquiries by a given 
person or within this or that group about the nat- 
ural world. Possibly they happened under some 
truth-clouding influence, like magic, and ought to 
be ranked as Pseudo-Science. But whatever their 
trustworthiness they may concern nature from the 
point of view of Mathematics, or of Mechanics, or 
of Physics, or of Astronomy (astral physics), or 
of Chemistry, or of Biology (with subdivisions 
for zoology and botany); or may deal especially 
with the earth, possibly after the manner of Ge- 
ology, or of Geography, physical, or human (An- 
thropogeography) ; or may be about natural man, 
in the way perhaps of Anthropology, or of Eth- 
nology or Ethnography, or of Human Physiology 
or of Human Psychology: Or they may have to 
do with applications of knowledge of the natural 
world to human needs in general, APPLIED SCIENCE: 
in this case they may pertain to quests and efforts 
against disease, or in behalf of health, and be 
classifiable as Medical (with subdivisions for ther- 
apeuties, surgery, ete.) ; or to such applications as 
may be called in short Engineering (with divisions 
of civil, mechanical, electrical, ete.) ; or to the In- 
dustrial or Technical Arts; or to Agriculture (in 
an inclusive sense, with sections for its various 
special fields). 
In large measure the matters intellectual will 
94 
   
-P-A-G-E-101
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
concern what are commonly called the FINE aRTs. 
They will have to do that is with some of the 
chief sorts of effort among men to produce not 
necessarily what would be useful but what would 
appeal to the emotions, give pleasure, minister 
to feeling for beauty. Here should enter things 
about Architecture, the art of building; about 
Painting, or representing through figures and col- 
ors on a surface; about Sculpture, in the round or 
in relief; about the various Graphic Arts aside 
from painting (drawing, etching, engraving) ; 
about Music, the artistic use of sounds; possibly 
also about Dancing, as an art. 
Under intellectual, still once more, may be 
things general enough in scope or character to be 
classed as pHiLosopHy. And here separate provi- 
sion may be made for matter pertaining to Logic, 
as fundamental toward knowing; and if one 
wishes, on the same ground, for Psychology. 
Separate provision may be made also for the phi- 
losophy of various branches of inquiry: Meta- 
physics; Ethics; ZEsthetics; (plus philosophy of 
history, of law, of education, etc.). 
Obviously, the classes and subclasses of such 
kind may be very considerably as the student may 
choose. The phenomena dealt with show in actual 
life no really separating lines; and the lines as- 
95
-P-A-G-E-102
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
cribed by experts, in history or kindred fields, are 
far from being fully uniform. The number of 
even major divisions and subdivisions may just 
as well be somewhat more or somewhat less than 
here suggested; or their distribution and naming 
different. It is quite possible, for example, to as- 
sociate matters in regard to habitation, clothing 
and food rather with things economic than with 
things social, and label them, say, consumMpPTION. 
Or things about education may if one prefers be 
put not first under intellectual, as here , but later 
thereunder; or may be divided and put in great 
part under social. Many will wish to have a 
major division for things INTERNATIONAL, 
and perhaps gather there not only numerous 
things political but also a lot of matters social or 
economic or religious or intellectual. And cer- 
tainly in the divisions of lesser or more detailed 
sort, apropos say of intensive inquiry about 
highly organized groups, the opportunities for 
individual planning will be numerous. 
But some such procedure, some such classing 
and subclassing, with the systematic questioning 
it implies, is highly essential. Not simply essen- 
tial; it is inevitable; and what is really essential 
+See on this some cogent statements by Seignobos, in Langlois

is that one do the thing well, not ill. A great deal 
of what is in hand will find place appropriately in 
more than one section or compartment; in that 
case to distinguish is all the more needful. Only 
when distinguishing and grouping by kind is well 
carried out will the way be opened effectively for 
interpretative consideration of such or such phe- 
nomena of this or that sort, about a given group 
or person, in the light of the phenomena of other 
sorts with which they were conjoined in life. 
There is withal a specifiable limit to the degree 
of freedom, or individual procedure, that would 
prove worth while. Students in the human fields | 
must count on using each other’s work; and like- 
nesses are desirable in the ways of doing the work. 
Such likenesses do indeed exist, in classifying by 
kind as in other respects. The practice of experts 
in history certainly shows substantial samenesses, 
or at least similarities, both as to the plan followed 
and as to the terms employed for its different 
parts. And it behooves every student to make 
sure that he sees the why or wherefore for these 
similarities and arranges his own practice in at 
least sufficient harmony with that obtaining among 
others to permit him to use their work comfortably 
and to have what he does himself reasonably intel- 
ligible and convenient for them.

CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
Within Field of History: According to Time 
Third, in the historical field, one’s arrange- 
ments for classifying should include procedure 
according to time. 
The problem here is two sided. Human affairs, 
in any given group, thread very much from side 
to side as it were—like the woof in a piece of 
cloth. But they also thread forward, and change 
variously as their weavers proceed. There should 
be ways and means, then, for advantageous study 
of such things, both to inquire into the life of a 
person or lot of people as that life was on the 
cross-section of this or that time, say, day, or year, 
or perhaps period, and to inquire linearly into 
the life concerned: to consider an individual or 
group alike at any particular time and through a 
succession of times. 
In a cross-sectional inquiry interest should be 
expected to center mainly on habitudes. What 
conditions, institutions, customs, usages, charac- 
terized such or such people or such or such per- 
son—or people or person in such or such place— 
at the time represented by a given cross-section? 
For example, concerning France in the feudal 
period or in 1789, or the United States in the 
Civil War or in 1920: what was the state or prac- 
tice in this or that respect, say as to foods, or 
means of transportation, or ways of treating 
101
-P-A-G-E-108
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
crime? Or in several respects, say economically 
in general, or politically in general? Or in all 
respects together, without distinction economi- 
cally, politically, and the rest? 
But there should be accommodation also for any 
happenings of the time in question that seemed to 
have the character of events. For among the es- 
sentials about an event is the time when or within 
which it occurred; and the basic place in which to 
keep track of this and the materials pertinent 
thereto—transpose and cross-refer as one may— 
is on the same cross-section with the habitudes in 
whose midst it happened. 
Any cross-section chosen can be marked by some 
sort of division card: so for instance Germany or 
the United States or the Western World in the 
Great War; or Germany, or the United States, or 
the Western World materially, or politically, or 
economically, and so on, in that time; or likewise 
Germany, or the United States, or the Western 
World with reference to any subdivision of any 
one of the larger aspects—as agricultural under 
economic, during the war, or military under po- 
litical, in that time. Then back of any such divi- 
sion card may be cards of some other type to dis- 
tinguish between institutions and events, for the 
time in question. Back of these in turn would ap- 
pear cards for the several institutions or events 
102  
-P-A-G-E-109
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
as to which sources or data were in hand, or at 
least were being sought. 
In a linear inquiry, it may well be thought habi- 
tudes should still have the foreground; since 
any change going on among humans must be 
change in the conditions, or practices, or thinking 
and feeling of those humans; since also the 
changes in any one sort of condition or practice 
or state will be due very largely, possibly even 
primarily, to something in the conditions or prac- 
tices or states of other sorts present in the same 
life. But certainly special provision must be 
made here as to the happenings or complexes of 
unique kind. Not simply have their time and man- 
ner of occurrence to be found truly; their origins 
as well are to be considered, and what share or 
role each had in later times. 
When an institution or custom or any bundle 
of such things is in the foreground for linear in- 
quiry, dependence clearly will have to be placed 
on the extent to which cross-sectional quests about 
the matter or matters concerned have been or 
can be carried out. The life of the group or per- 
son considered will have to be seen, in the respect 
or respects in question, at least at two specific 
times of that life; usually more than two, but 
necessarily two. For instance, to make a study of 
France with respect to serfdom from 1300 to 1789, 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
    PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
or education in the United States from 1865 to 
1920, one must assemble materials and data any- 
way for the particular years 1300 and 1789, or 
1865 and 1920; but in addition for as many other 
particular times between those two as may seem 
essential under the circumstances. And so for 
any other characteristic, or group of character- 
istics, about people or person in any place. 
Many changes will be revealed by such pro- 
cedure. Some of them will seem more or less 
haphazard; explainable possibly, but without 
common line. Others will appear to go some- 
where, to bear sufficiently in some one sense or 
direction to be called an ‘‘evolution.’’? In this 
case, one may wish to trace the ‘‘evolution’’ so as 
to mark its successive stages. 
If it is an event that is being considered, in the 
linear way, the primary dependence must again 
be on the degree to which cross-sectional inquiries 
about the life affecting the event or affected by 
it have been or can be made. Happenings or 
complexes of the unique kind usually have con- 
tributing causes that go far back before the date 
of occurrence; and they have influence afterward, 
often long after—as with the crucifying of Jesus, 
or the Great Charter, or Waterloo. And while one 
may wish to keep track of events on the cross-sec- 
tion where they happened, to deal with them ade- 
104

quately it will be necessary to have them in mind 
—by cross-reference if preferred but at any rate 
in mind—on every cross-section to which either 
their origins or their effects may possibly have 
reached. 
In reality then the two sorts of consideration, 
cross-sectional and linear, must be conducted to- 
gether. Or at least each sort must be carried on 
more or less in the light of the other. Some illus- 
tration of ways and means for classifying by time 
is given in Examples 63 and following. 
Within Field of History: Bibliographical 
Historical notes of the bibliographical sort, will 
of course, like other notes, fit into the sections by 
location, kind, and time; where they go being de- 
termined by the subjects of which the pieces sev- 
erally treat. And such notes, again like other 
notes, very often may be classified in more than 
one place; may be put for instance in some more 
inclusive compartment than their subject strictly 
would require, or may be moved about a good 
deal, to compartments of cognate subjects. But 
wherever lodged they should be provided for es- 
pecially, in at least four respects. 
First, the bibliographical notes pertaining to a 
given subject—or in a given compartment—should 
be readily distinguishable from other notes: to 
105 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
get in touch with them should take but a moment. 
Such notes may all have been constructed in a 
special way—what they are will be apparent on 
looking at the distribution of their data.on the 
slip or sheet. Or also they may have been made 
on some particular type of material, say a lined 
library card, or paper of some particular color. 
All this is insufficient. In addition separate 
grouping is needed. Bibliographical materials 
wherever occurring and whatever their number 
should be assembled together, and located in some 
uniform or standard way. And many will think, 
certainly unless a special type of material is used, 
that the bounds of each group better be marked 
by division cards of some very distinctive color— 
say vermilion or cardinal. There may thus never 
be any doubt concerning what are or what are not 
bibliographical materials. 
The best choice for the standard location of a 
bibliographical group would seem to be just after 
the division card indicative of the subject or com- 
partment to which the materials applied. Not 
always just after, possibly, but at any rate imme- 
diately following any notes that may have been 
lodged there temporarily, for distribution within 
the compartment concerned. About Joan of Are 
then, or the battle of the Marne, or Germany or 
France in the Great War, or social changes pro-

  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
moted by the automobile, or the history of coffee, 
or of the pin, whatever the subject, the biblio- 
graphicat notes pertaining thereto would always 
be grouped at the beginning; or at a correspond- 
ing place concerning some cognate or more in- 
elusive subject. 
Second, the materials within any bibliographi- 
cal group should be distinguishable from each 
other at least according to the alphabet. Hach 
such group, that is, should have a series based 
simply on alphabetical order. This would be a 
sort of primary series, in which might be kept— 
whatever else should be done with the group— 
either all or any portion of its pieces. The series 
should be marked by a special sort of division 
card, with some such label as ‘‘By Author,” ‘‘By 
Author and Work,”’ or ‘‘Authors and Works.’’ 
Often this would be the only series one might care 
to erect for a bibliographical group; in any case 
it ought to stand at the beginning of the group— 
preceding, that is, any of the other kinds of series 
that might seem desirable. 
Third, the materials within any bibliographical 
group should also be distinguishable from each 
other according to type or sort. However satis- 
factory under some circumstances the conven- 
tional alphabetical arrangement may prove, seri- 
ous study of any subject will necessitate seeing the 
107 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
relations, or perspective, of the several sources of 
information through which the study may be 
made. And the first step in that direction is to 
see of what sorts the materials indicated by one’s 
notes may be. 
Some will be, assuming an appropriately in- 
clusive lot is taken as example, of sort or sorts to 
permit the label ‘‘Original’’ or ‘‘Primary.’’ This 
means they give more or less direct trace or track 
of the phenomena concerned. No sources of in- 
formation about humans in the past can have the 
directness obtainable for inquiries into physical 
nature; but at least some are more direct than 
others in the trace they furnish. 
Under ‘‘Original’’ or ‘‘Primary’’ may come, 
should a student prefer, distinction between mate- 
rials in manuscript—say with label ‘‘Mss.’’—and 
those in print—say ‘‘Printed.’’ The state how- 
ever of being in print or not in print tells nothing 
of the real character of materials. Generally, one 
may better keep to difference in type, and under 
“Original”? or ‘‘Primary’’ have in view such chief 
classes as ‘‘Remains’’; ‘‘Documents,’’ or ‘‘Docu- 
mentary’’; ‘‘Literary’’; and ‘‘Pictorial.’’ For 
each chief class! in turn there would be sub-

History, ii.

CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
divisions, according to circumstances: under ‘‘Re- 
mains,’’ perhaps Material (such as places, build- 
ings, utensils), or Social (such as languages, or 
customs of other sorts still in use) ; under ‘‘Docu- 
ments’’—chiefly acts brought into writing for the 
conduct of affairs,—possibly Public (such as laws, 
or judicial decisions, or military orders), possibly 
Private (such as a merchant’s daybook, or a 
manufacturer’s journal, or the accounts of a 
plantation) ; under ‘‘Literary’’ all writings into 
which the author has put more or less of himself, 
possibly letters, or a diary, or autobiography, or a 
speech, or some discussion or account avowedly 
scientific or literary—an article maybe, or a his- 
tory, or a poem or novel; under ‘‘Pictorial,’’ rep- 
resentations of people or things by such means as 
printing or sculpture, or drawing or engraving of 
some kind, or perhaps map or chart, or in more 
recent times photograph or phonograph. 
Other sources of information, other that is than 
‘Original’? or ‘‘Primary,’’ may properly be 
called ‘‘Derived’’; meaning that they have been 
drawn or built, more or less directly, from the 
primary sources. Another name that will serve 
is ‘‘Works’’; and if there is occasion to distin- 
guish recent productions of the kind from some 
done several generations or centuries ago, use 
may be made of the captions ‘‘Harlier’’ and 
109 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
‘‘Modern,’’ either before or after the word 
‘““Works.’’ Such sources of information are often 
referred to as ‘‘Secondary,’’ especially in Eng- 
lish speaking lands. But that implies, at least to 
many students, ‘‘from the second hand’’; and the 
derivation concerned is frequently not so direct— 
is rather of the third or fourth hand, or possibly 
still further along the line. 
Under ‘‘Derived’’ (or whatever expression is 
used instead), many pieces may really be second- 
ary, in the sense of next after the original sources 
—because built directly from them. They will be 
mostly works of limited or relatively limited sub- 
ject, a biography possibly, or study of an institu- 
tion or event—will concern a particular problem 
of some sort: this being the condition on which as 
a rule an author could in the time at his disposal 
deal with a matter ‘‘from the sources.’’ For a 
group of such productions the caption ‘‘Mono- 
graphs’’ may serve, or possibly better ‘‘Special 
Studies,’’ or simply ‘‘Special.’’ 
Under ‘‘Derived’’ again, or ‘‘Works,’’ or 
“‘Modern Works’’ many pieces may be labelable 
“‘General,’’ or ‘‘General Treatments’’; being con- 
cerned with a large or relatively large subject as 
a whole, or forming part of some work on a still 
larger subject. The extent of the subject makes 
unreasonable any attempt to treat it as a whole 
110
-P-A-G-E-117
CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
only or even dominantly from the sources: for 
example, a history of France, or of England, or of 
the United States. Large reliance on special 
works is necessary. The general works in turn 
may be groupable according to their extent; some 
being extremely short, others longer but still 
short (possibly ‘‘Medium’’), others going into 
considerable detail (possibly ‘‘Longer,’’ or ‘‘De- 
tailed’’). Or again such works may seem group- 
able with advantage according to the public ad- 
dressed: may be, whether long or short, more or 
less popular, designed for the wider public; or 
may be ‘‘Manuals’’ or ‘‘Handbooks’”’ of scientific 
sort, strictly for the use of serious students; or 
may possibly be for school use, meaning chiefly 
the secondary schools. 
Once more under ‘‘Derived,’’ some pieces may 
have as special object to give aid in the finding 
or using of the sources on a given matter; either 
the original or the derived sources or both, or 
some part of either or both. For such pieces the 
label ‘‘ Bibliographical Aids’’ will be appropriate. 
Some may do little more than list authors and 
works, with the barest data about each, after the 
manner of a library catalogue or the familiar 
Poole Index. But others will go into more detail, 
in regard to authors or works or both, and fur- 
nish indispensable critical help: witness the work 
111 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
by Molinier and others on the history of France, 
that by Winsor on America, or some review by 
a competent scholar. 
For illustration of one way of arranging the 
various sorts of bibliographical materials, with 
appropriate division cards and labels, see Hx- 
ample 70. 
Additional groupings under either ‘‘Primary”’ 
or ‘‘Derived’’ may of course be desirable for a 
given bibliography; that will depend on the mat- 
ter concerned or the intensiveness of one’s study. 
And both the bounds and labels of such groupings 
as have just been suggested may be arranged 
somewhat differently. How various, within cer- 
tain limits, the planning in these things can be, is 
observable in the bibliographies of the Cambridge 
Modern History and Cambridge Medieval His- 
tory; or say in the bibliographical sections of the 
Revue d’Histoire Ecclésiastique and the Histor- 
ische Vierteljahrschrift. Oftentimes one may 
prefer to proceed by aid of a species of cross-ref- 
erence; keeping the various cards or slips made 
or accumulated about a given document or work 
all in the series ‘‘By Author and Work,’’ and em- 
ploying for the several types or sorts only extra 
cards or slips that would indicate in the briefest 
way the relevant documents or works. But there 
can be no doubt one should have some special way, 
or ways, of caring for this matter. 
112 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
  CLASSIFICATION AND FILING 
The materials for almost any subject will differ 
much in worth. And to a large degree the differ- 
ences may be indicated by classification according 
to kind or type—the qualities of each such kind 
or type being either commonly known or dis- 
coverable through study and experience. 
Finally, bibliographical materials should be dis- 
tinguishable according to variances in any partic- 
ular respect affecting their worth. Among the 
remains or documents or works bearing on a 
given subject, the relative value of any piece 
within its own sort or class, or in comparison 
with pieces of other sort or class, will depend 
in last resort on the circumstances surrounding 
the origin of each piece concerned. Distinctions 
of kind or type are helpful as far as they go, but 
do not reach many significant particulars. Among 
manuscripts for instance an original is to be pre- 
ferred to a copy, and a copy of the original to a 
copy of a copy. A recent edition of a document, 
made by a competent scholar, should very likely 
stand ahead of all previous editions. General 
works, short or long, may show the influence of 
the period or section or sect or party from whose 
midst they came. Even special studies may be 
done with bias, and inevitably will vary with the 
state of original materials and the interests and 
competence of successive investigators. If a 
translation of a document or work is employed, 
113  
-P-A-G-E-120
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
there are problems about the translating as well 
as the piece translated. 
All these points and others of the more par- 
ticular order must certainly be cared for in some 
fashion. At the same time, operations on them 
will always be so intimately bound up with each 
worker’s own qualities or preferences that prob- 
ably the devising of appropriate arrangements, 
or ways of proceeding, for each such point or 
problem may better be left to the individual stu- 
dent. Assuming that the requisite pains about 
particulars are really taken, the inquirer may 
really succeed in seeing each piece he proposes to 
use in due perspective, or relations, with the other 
relevant pieces. Further, he may thus arrive at 
that best sort of bibliographical knowledge: a 
view of the lines of progress on a subject, of the 
history of work thereon. 
114

VI 
USE OF NOTES TOWARD A GIVEN WORK 
JHUS far it has been assumed that a student 
with historical interests might wish to make 
notes appropriately on any matter and be able to 
eare fittingly for his accumulations however va- 
ried or numerous. Suppose now such a student 
desires especially to have both materials in hand 
and further work count well in the exploitation 
of some particular subject. Possibly he would set 
forth his experience or thinking about certain 
sources of information; or give the results of 
some quarrying from sources and works. Or pos- 
sibly he would study some question or subject in 
an interpretative or constructive way, by the aid 
of such sources or data as might be available, and 
tell the results suitably. In each case there is at 
least a problem of exposition, and in the last there 
is besides the varied difficulty special to inquiry 
of the constructive sort. All possible provision 
for such circumstances should be made. 
What procedure then can be recommended? 
What features can be given to a note-system in 
view more especially of the problems of construc- 
115 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
tion and exposition—of preparing a lecture or 
paper or article or book in the historical field? 
Special Sections or Compartments 
To start with, a worker may arrange if he 
wishes for carrying on a study or bit of writing 
through special sections or compartments within 
his established compartments by location, kind, 
and time. Suppose for example a student has in- 
terest.of this sort concerning Columbus, or per- 
haps Bismarck, or the assassination of Lincoln, 
or economic Spain in the sixteenth century, or the 
western world in the Middle Ages, or the contem- 
porary world. At the point, or one of the points, 
in his note-system where the subject fits in, in 
the midst of or just after materials pertinent 
thereto, let a card be set up bearing the name of 
the subject and also—preferably at the right— 
the caption ‘‘Exposition,’’ or ‘‘Construction and 
Exposition.’’ Then, following this, as the work 
develops let other cards be set up, as the subject 
and the particular object in view may require. 
Or again, if the worker choose, he may provide 
for the treating of a subject quite outside his 
regular established compartments, say in some 
special box or drawer, or group of boxes or 
drawers; or may transfer to special accommoda- 
tions a subject begun in the other way. It may 
116 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
USE OF NOTES TOWARD A GIVEN WORK 
indeed be a whole series of subjects for which he 
thus seeks to provide. Whenever the undertak- 
ing is either at all extensive or very intensive, 
the separate or segregated way will be the better. 
In this case each subject so provided for may well 
be begun with a title card, and have following that 
—though how immediately will depend on circum- 
stances—the card indicating ‘‘Exposition,’’ or 
*<Construction and Exposition.’’ 
Assembly for Construction and Exposition 
At the outset in any set of compartments for 
construction and exposition should stand a sec- 
tion to which the caption ‘‘Outline’’ will apply. 
When exposition is undertaken it is certainly es- 
sential to have a scheme of the questions or points 
to be covered. With further study many changes 
in the scheme may seem desirable. But a plan for 
the proposed exposition, even though quite tenta- 
tive, is a sine qua non. The plan may of course 
be only in the mind. But if at all lengthy or com- 
plicated, or not worked on consecutively, there is 
advantage in having it down on paper. One can 
arrange very easily, too, both for making changes 
and for keeping track of the plans already tried: 
this by two or three distinctive subdivision cards, 
with some such captions as ‘‘In process,’’ ‘‘Re- 
jected,’’ and ‘‘ Acceptable.”’ 
117
-P-A-G-E-124
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
Just how the outlined plan should be carried 
out will depend very much on individual prefer- 
ences or exigencies. Hither small slips or sheets 
of say letter size may be used alike for the out- 
line and for the composing. If the larger sheets 
are used the worker will likely proceed, whether 
with script or with type, straight away from page 
to page, without stop except possibly at the end 
of a section, or at the end of each paragraph. If 
small slips are used it may seem well, at least to 
some workers, to go by sentences, one sentence 
on each slip. By arranging the slips backwards 
—the second in front of the first, third in front 
of second, and so on—and spreading them out in 
line, as much of what has been written may be 
seen together as is desired. Footnotes, too, are 
very easily provided for if small slips are used; 
each such note being makable on a separate slip 
of some sort, which can then be kept with—or 
moved with—the slip to whose matter it relates. 
But in either case—use of slips or use of sheets— 
the questions or points shown in the outline should 
appear, in the same order, as captions on division 
or subdivision cards following the card marked 
“‘Outline.’? And so much of the composition, as 
it proceeds, should be behind each division or sub- 
division card as may belong there according to 
the plan—or as one may choose to keep in that 
118 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  USE OF NOTES TOWARD A GIVEN WORK 
way. For general illustration of this sort of pro- 
vision for exposition see Example 75. 
The materials, however, with which to construct 
and set forth; what should happen to them if 
steps are taken to develop a subject separately, 
outside the quarters by location, kind or time? 
Doubtless in many instances the student will be 
relying directly on books or manuscripts, and in 
archives or libraries unless he is able to have their 
materials beside him. But if he has made or ac- 
cumulated notes on the matter in hand, where 
ought they to be, apropos of such endeavor? 
The answer at least some will make to this is 
that the notes bearing immediately on the subject 
under treatment should be arranged in some way 
under the plan of construction and exposition it- 
self. Materials that may be of service only in- 
directly, or incidentally, can well be consulted at 
their normal place in one’s files. But the rest, 
those to be depended on especially, better be sin- 
gled out from whatever locations may have been 
given them already, or held in some temporary 
way till the plan of construction and exposition is 
developed—if they are being made on a subject 
quite fresh to the worker,—and distributed or re- 
distributed around the several points of the out- 
line adopted. And if notes are made on one or 
another aspect of the subject after the exposition 
119
-P-A-G-E-126
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
has been started, they can of course be put forth- 
with into the compartment or compartments of 
the exposition where they seem to fit. 
Other students however will answer differently. 
To arrange materials, apropos of construction 
and exposition, directly around the points of an 
outline will seem to them very disadvantageous. 
For one thing, much of the study appropriate for 
this or that subject undertaken, and the accom- 
panying accumulation of materials, should be ex- 
pected to go on before any settlement in regard 
to an outline would be reached, or even attempted 
—either on the subject as a whole or any aspect 
of it. For another, an outline, if managed in the 
right spirit, should always be subject to change. 
A student is lost with any subject who allows him- 
self—either from satisfaction or firmness of pur- 
pose—to think of any such plan as final; yet every 
change of any moment would mean more or less 
redistribution of materials. The procedure ought 
to be such that the marshaling of materials and 
the planning of constructions and expositions 
need not interfere with each other. That is, the 
assembling for a construction or exposition should 
be carried on not directly under the heads of an 
outline but conveniently near by; in front say, or 
by side of, the compartments corresponding to 
divisions of the outline. 
120
-P-A-G-E-127
  USE OF NOTES TOWARD A GIVEN WORK 
Just how assembling of the kind meant should 
turn out in any given case would depend of course 
very much on the subject, and the extent and va- 
riety of the worker’s aims. But in general, one 
would wish to employ therefor just such sections 
or compartments as were advised for the his- 
torical field as a whole: only on a scale suitable 
to the particular subject under treatment. And 
these sections or compartments may be located 
after the title card for the subject, and preceding 
the card denoting ‘‘Construction and HExposi- 
tion.’’ 
In simpler cases, where the materials to be 
assembled—in hand or in prospect—looked few, 
it would probably seem sufficient to erect, with the 
aid of other division cards in sequence to or under 
that for the subject, two or three compartments 
whose labels should be—in addition to the name 
of the subject in each instance or without that 
name—EVENTS; INSTITUTIONS (or CUS: 
TOMS, or some expression denoting habitudes) ; 
PERSONS. Then under each such section would 
come of course subdivisions, with appropriate 
division cards and labels for each of the particular 
events or habitudes or persons on which the ma- 
terials in hand or in prospect bore. For an illus- 
tration see Example 76. 
For more complex circumstances, say an ex- 
121
-P-A-G-E-128
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
tensive study of the Crusades, or the French 
Revolution, or the recent Great War, one might 
think best to have, first after the title card, a 
series of sections according to location (for ex- 
ample: World, Asia; Western World; England; 
France; Italy; Germany; Near East), each such 
section being marked by a division card denoting 
a general group (or the equivalent place) ; and in 
these divisions by location sections for events, 
habitudes, and persons. Or in this or that or all 
of the divisions by location, one might wish to go 
by kind or aspect (say Western World, Political, 
or Economic, or Intellectual; or France, Political, 
Social, Religious) ; or any one of such larger kinds 
might be analyzed into subdivisions of various 
grades. In such case, that is of proceeding by 
kind, the division according to events, habitudes, 
or persons would fit in at any point. 
Or in this or that or all of the divisions by 
either location or kind one might wish to proceed 
by time (say Western World or Italy or Near 
East, 11th century, or 1914; or Germany, Politi- 
eal, under Ferderick Barbarossa, or Wilhelm II; 
or France, Economic, under Philip Augustus, or 
in 1914). Here too of course the filling in would 
include division by events, habitudes, or persons. 
For some illustration, see Example 77. 
All this assumes that one would be proceeding 
122 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
USE OF NOTES TOWARD A GIVEN WORK 
primarily by location, just as was advised for the 
general classification under history. Very often 
however the problems raised about a subject 
would require, or seem to require, view of the ma- 
terials primarily by kind, or primarily by time. 
Any distributing or redistributing of such sort 
that promised advantage should always be devis- 
able; but success with it will be furthered by 
keeping well in mind—if not in actual view—the 
lines of procedure by location. 
The student with an eye to economy of time will 
soon perceive short cuts for much of the work of 
assembly for construction and exposition. In- 
stead of building a wholly new framework 
apropos of any such undertaking, he will simply 
transfer notes from one place to another, whole 
groups or sections of them, sometimes with di- 
vision cards, sometimes without. Track of what 
is done in such way can always be kept by cross- 
reference, if convenience counsels. 
Governing Spirit for a Note-system 
Special provision for construction and expo- 
sition, in one’s note-system, ought to help define 
how such an instrument should be used. It is 
obvious that intelligently made notes may give in- 
dispensable guidance to and through sources of 
information, and aid in quarrying therefrom so 
123
-P-A-G-E-130
  PRINCIPLES OF A NOTE-SYSTEM 
that a job may be finished, in some sense, as the 
work proceeds. Clearly too the usefulness of 
notes can be greatly increased by convenient ar- 
rangements for their housing and manipulation. 
What apparently is not so clear, not always rea- 
lized keenly enough, is that a note-system, with 
all its usefulness, should be but means to an end. 
Far too many historical articles and books bear 
witness of having been done, as it were from note 
to printed page; more or less directly, without 
passing digestively through a human head. The 
appropriate road certainly is via the head; and no 
devices should be allowed to numb us to the neces- 
sity of reliving every matter taken up. But if 
there are to be devices, it is well that some of 
them reflect a conviction that there is far more to 
construction and exposition than simply the repro- 
ducing of materials in accordance with sections 
and subsections suitable primarily for analysis 
and housing. This in turn may further, for all 
one’s practice concerning notes, what is surely 
the most indispensable condition of real success 
in construction and exposition, namely, personal 
digesting.

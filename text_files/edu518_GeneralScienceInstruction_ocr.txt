PART I. 
CHAPTER I. 
THE PRESENT STATUS OF GENERAL SCIENCE. 
THE presentation of General Science may be defined as 
a method of teaching the laws of Nature and their applica- 
tions in the inventions of man without considering the 
boundaries of those groups into which scientific knowledge 
is usually divided: astronomy, botany, chemistry, physics, 
physiography, . . . zodlogy. The method is not new, 
for books treating of natural phenomena in this general 
manner were published fifty years and more ago as read- 
ers for the schools, and at any given date in the last half 
century one or more such texts have been on the market. 
In many, if not most, of them the biological phases of sci- 
ence as embodied in Nature Study have predominated. 
The present tide of interest in the content and method 
of General Science dates from about 1912, when the pub- 
lication of texts in rapid sequence was begun. The United 
States Commissioner of Education’s Report for 1890-1910, 
published in 1910, had just announced the startling fact 
that the sciences were rapidly waning in popularity in high 
schools, as evidenced by the decreasing per cent of enroll- 
ment. The school journals had published several articles 
condemning “university domination” of high-school sci- 
ence, the criticism being largely directed at the types of 
entrance examinations, and other requirements of college- 
entrance boards, which seemed to demand that thé content 
and method of high-school science be essentially that of a 
diluted college course, with emphasis on laws and theories 
rather than applications and everyday illustrations. 
If causes are to be judged by results, the psychological 
moment had arrived for radically altering the methods of 
teaching science to pupils in early adolescence, for from 
1911 to the present date (January 1, 1920) twenty-two 
texts have been published, also many laboratory manuals, 
either independent or accompanying texts; a quarterly 
journal devoted exclusively to General Science has entered 
its third volume; departments of General Science have been 
opened in several educational journals; committees under 
the auspices of the National Educational Association, the 
Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers, etc., 
have had official status and published reports, and the in-
-P-A-G-E-6
  
6 Science for the Grades 
clusion of General Science in the eighth and ninth grades 
has spread rapidly throughout the nation. 
Of course the new subject has met with strong opposi- 
tion, and each of its claims has been countered by closely 
related criticisms.! It is unfortunate that but few of the 
arguments for or against General Science have been based 
on any accurate examination of texts or manuals. 
The writer, in 1917,2 examined the ten textbooks then 
on the market page by page, and made a critical analysis of 
the purpose, subject-matter, and method of treatment found 
therein. In the spring of 1919 the list was again brought 
up to date, and eighteen texts which had been advertised or 
reviewed in school journals were examined, and an analysis 
of these texts, greatly amplified and considering many 
phases not included in the first analysis, comprises the first 
portion of this study.

CHAPTER II. 
METHOD OF THE ANALYSIS. 
THE eighteen texts contain a total of 6,638 pages of in- 
struction, all tables of contents, introductions, prefaces, 
general review questions, appendices, and indices excluded. 
These pages were carefully examined one by one, and an 
entry made on a card for every half page, labeling each 
card with the title of the topic, the name of the book, and 
page number of the topic, to permit future identification. 
The cards were then arranged under headings of the gen- 
erally recognized branches of scientific knowledge, then 
-rearranged under the important topics in each of these spe- 
cial sciences. This distribution, and a number of subse- 
quent ones by texts, by size of topics, etc., form the minute 
data from which the tables of this study are obtained. 
The topic. The employment of a certain degree of per- 
sonal judgment was inevitable in these arrangements. It 
was first necessary to decide upon a title for the subject- 
matter discussed in a given half page. For example, if 
the instrument by which the weight of air may be meas- 
ured was described and illustrated, the word “barometer” 
was written as the title, especially if the paragraph or page 
heading gave the hint. 
The science. It was necessary to judge whether the topic 
was properly included in any of the several principal divi- 
sions of science, and, if so, which one. While the barom- 
eter is discussed in several sciences, notably chemistry, 
physics, meteorology, yet its principle is a law of physics 
fundamental to all the phenomena of the mechanics of 
fluids. Chemistry and meteorology deal with the applica- 
tions and interpretations of air pressure after it has been 
measured, rather than with the workings of the barometer. 
Texts in physics treat the topic more fully than do texts in 
the other sciences. The assignment of the topic “barome- 
ter’ to the science of physics seems just and reasonable 
from these considerations. 
In like manner each topic was assigned to some science, 
or to a purely miscellaneous group, the best possible indi- 
vidual judgment being brought to bear on each decision. 
The writer has. had teaching experience in each and every 
subject of the high-school science curriculum, and founds 
these judgments upon the knowledge thus acquired. 
The unit group. Closely related topics were grouped to  
-P-A-G-E-8
  
8 Science for the Grades 
reduce the number of units to be handled. The content of 
General Science could be far more easily, and almost as 
accurately, judged from an examination of these groups 
than from the display of the great mass of minute data. 
The topic “barometer” thus becomes linked with other top- 
ics of air pressure and measurement as considered in phys- 
ics, under a more general heading, and forms a medium- 
sized unit of subject-matter neither as small as a para- 
graph nor as large as a chapter.
-P-A-G-E-9
  
CHAPTER III. 
THE SUBJECT-MATTER OF GENERAL SCIENCE. 
It was found that the space devoted to instruction in the 
eighteen texts examined comprised topics which might be 
considered as belonging to eight large science groups, which 
ranked in importance as to space as follows: 
     
    Pages 
--- 2,212.5 Physiography —--_ 908.0 Physiology 632.0 Household / 
271.5 Miscellaneous 
    Table I. shows the unit groups of these sciences ranked 
in the order, first, of the number of texts which include top- 
ics of the group; second, the number of pages devoted to 
the group in these texts. The column headed “Test Topics” 
will be referred to in the latter portion of this study. If 
ten texts be considered as a clear majority of the eighteen, 
it is seen that there is considerable agreement as to the 
most suitable subject-matter in the principal sciences, the 
number of unit groups, and the number of pages devoted 
to topics found in ten or more texts having the following 
percentage for each science: 
     
     
  Sctence Unit Sctence Unit Pages Groups * Pages Groups 
%o %o % % 
Physiography 47.8 Physics ~__ 54.4 
Physiology 33.3 Astronomy 40.0 34.2 Biology (Botany 15.4 Zodlogy —---- Miscelianeous —_ Chemistry 
Household Art —__ 
  In every science, except zodlogy, over half of the pages of 
instruction are devoted to the discussion of topics which are 
also found in a majority of the other texts. A general con- 
clusion may certainly be drawn from this condition—that 
General Science is by no means a mass of unrelated subject- 
matter, and that there is a recognition of the acceptability 
of a large mass of the subject-matter of the so-called “spe- 
cial sciences” by the authors of these texts.

groups in each of the eighteen texts, in each case the sci- 
ences being ranked in order. This minute data is recorded 
for reference, but a more comprehensive appreciation of the 
status of the sciences may be obtained from the summary 
of this table. The rank of Physics, as most important in 
the matter of space devoted to its topics, is indisputable. 
The deviations of this science from first rank in the texts 
are almost negligible. The agreement as to the ranks of 
other sciences is less unanimous, but uniform—that is, the 
deviations from the median rank are practically the same. 
Even Physiology, which most greatly varies in the impor- 
tance assigned to it by different authors, shows a median 
deviation of only 1.5 ranks either way.
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 Science for the Grades 
Since the median rank of Biology and Physiography is 
third in each case, and the deviations are identical, these 
sciences are tied as to importance. Physiography: occurs 
first in two texts, however, and is recorded above Biology 
for this reason. Physiology and Chemistry have also the 
same median rank, but the deviation of Physiology is 
greater, and toward the higher ranks—a difference which 
is clearly brought out by the calculation of the least sum, 
which gives that science a slight advantage. 
The treatment accorded to Household Art and Astronomy 
is decidedly superficial. As expected, neither of these sci- 
ences ranks first or second. The small amount of space de- 
voted to Miscellaneous topics is another contradiction of 
the claim that much of General Science could not be classi- 
fied under the headings of the more familiar and estab- 
lished branches of scientific knowledge.

  CHAPTER IV. 
THE ACCEPTABILITY OF GENERAL SCIENCE TOPICS. 
THE richness of the field of science renders it very un- 
likely that there will ever be a recognized list of uniformly 
acceptable topics such as would be found in Latin gram- 
mars, histories, and mathematical texts. On the other 
hand, a text in General Science which was composed of top- 
ics found in no other texts would at once be branded as a 
freak; a science concerning which no two books agreed as 
to suitable material would be of questionable value for in- 
struction. It has appeared from the previous tables that 
authors of General Science texts have agreed in a large 
measure as to the suitability of certain topics in science, 
rather than indulging in that diversity which the inexhaust- 
ible material would permit. This agreement has not been 
uniform, of course, with the different sciences; it has been 
less uniform when the different texts are compared; and 
even the individual topics are susceptible of quantitative 
measurement as to their suitability, as evidenced by the 
space devoted to them in one or more of the eighteen texts. 
In order to determine this factor for the topics, and from 
these data to measure the degree of acceptability which 
characterizes each science and each text, a method of cal- 
culating an Acceptability Factor has been devised. 
Derivation of the formula 
2. 
ca = Acceptability Factor, 
where 
t = number of texts in which a topic occurs, 
T = total number of texts (18 in this study), 
p = number of pages devoted to the topic in a certain text, 
P = number of pages devoted to the topic in all texts, 
these data being recorded in Tables I. and II. 
The acceptability of a topic included in t texts compared 
with that of a topic found in T texts is the ratio t : T. 
The acceptability of a topic to which p pages are devoted 
in a certain text compared to the average number of pages 
devoted to that topic in each of the texts (18 or less) which 
include it is the ratio p : average, or p : P/t. 
The real acceptability, all influences being considered, is, 
therefore, represented by the value 
ular a hte SUL it A 
Teepe ee pet) pe 
t
-P-A-G-E-17
  
  Acceptability of General Science Topics 14, 
If all texts contained the topic, t/T would equal 1. 
If all texts containing the topic contained exactly the 
same space devoted to it, then no text would give excess or 
deficient attention to the topic, and tp/P would equal 1. 
A perfect acceptability, therefore, would result in a value 
of unity, which represents the characteristic treatment re- 
ceived by a topic if all authors were exactly agreed as to its 
importance. It makes no difference whether the topic re- 
ceives a large or small amount of space, the value obtained 
is a true measure of the degree to which the topic is uni- 
formly acceptable to General Science authors. 
The Acceptability Factor will be greater than 1 for a 
topic in a certain text which receives marked prominence 
as to space, and which is included in all, or nearly all, texts. 
The Acceptability Factor will be less than 1 for a topic 
in a certain text which is given little prominence in that 
text, or which occurs in only a few of the texts. 
A text with a high average Acceptability Factor in a cer- 
tain science contains topics in that science which have been 
considered important by most of the other authors of Gen- 
eral Science texts, and these topics have received space 
above, or at least only slightly below, the average space for 
those topics. 
A text with a low average Acceptability Factor in a cer- 
tain science has emphasized topics not considered impor- 
tant by other authors of General Science texts, and has 
omitted, or superficially treated, the topics which are gener- 
ally included by the other authors. Depending on the point 
of view, such a text would be commended for its originality, 
or criticized as a freak. It is at least sui generis. 
If a text ranks high or low in its average Acceptability 
Factor for all sciences, the corresponding general suitabil- 
ity of its topics, as measured by the composite opinions of 
all authors of General Science texts upon these topics, is in- 
dicated. 
If a science has a high average Acceptability Factor for 
the eighteen texts, there is considerable agreement among 
the authors of General Science texts as to the most charac- 
teristic and suitable topics of that science. 
If a science has a low average Acceptability Factor for 
the eighteen texts, there is a disagreement as to the most 
suitable topics. ) 
Examples. In text K, 13 pages were devoted to a dis- 
cussion of lenses and the refraction of light. This topic
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 Science for the Grades 
occurs in 12 books, and covers a total of 45 pages. Substi- 
tuting in the formula, 
d2x 12 x18 = 2.311, the Acceptability Factor, 
18 x 45 
which indicates that the author of this text considered this 
topic of over twice the importance assigned to it by the 
combined judgment of all authors of General Science texts. 
In text L, 4.5 pages were assigned to the topic of water 
and wind power, the topic being mentioned in 10 texts and 
covering 50 pages. Then substituting in the formula, 
10 x10 * 4.5 ie ———_—— = .500, the Acceptability Factor, 
18 x 50 
by which it is shown that this author selected a topic not 
considered acceptable by all authors, and gave it less than 
the average amount of space, the topic being rated at one- 
half the standard value it would have possessed if all the 
authors had agreed upon its use, and assigned a definite 
and uniform number of pages to its discussion. 
The Acceptability Factor was calculated for each of the 
1,557 unit topics of the eighteen texts of General Science. 
This minute data, although of interest, is exceedingly bulky, 
and Table III. contains only the following significant values 
for each text in each science: 
1. The number of topics which exceed the standard Ac- 
ceptability Factor of 1, and the average acceptability of 
these topics. 
2. The number of topics which have an Acceptability Fac- 
tor below the standard of 1, and the average acceptability 
of these topics. 
3. The total number of topics, and the average accepta- 
bility. ! 
4. The sciences are listed in the table in the order of the 
average acceptability of all their topics in all texts. 
5. In a summary the texts are ranked in the order of the 
average acceptability of all their topics in all sciences, the 
number of which is given. 
If the judgment of the writer be accepted, that an Ac- 
ceptability Factor of .500 or over indicates a satisfactory 
agreement as to the suitability of a topic, or if that value 
as an average for the topics of a text or a science represents 
a general suitability of the topic selected, it then appears 
that, with the exception of Household Arts and Zodlogy, 
there‘is a fairly well-established agreement among the au- 
thors of General Science as to what subject-matter is ap- 
propriate. Only six of the texts show a tendency to select

Acceptability of General Science Topics 19 
their material far afield. This agreement is more striking 
because the judgments of the authors have been made inde- 
pendently over a period of many years. General Science, 
as a whole, cannot be considered as a hodgepodge of unre- 
lated topics selected by irresponsible whims. Diametric 
attitudes might be taken as to which type of acceptability, 
high or low, was a characteristic of the best texts—the 
greater likeness to the more common topics of “special sci- 
ence” in the former case, or the greater freedom from tra- 
ditional principles and illustrations of these same “special 
sciences” in the latter type, being each offered as a desir- 
able quality on a General Science text. Whichever argu- 
ment appeals, the Acceptability Factor furnishes a quanti- 
tative measure of the true condition.

  CHAPTER V. 
THE SIZE OF UNDIVIDED TOPICS IN GENERAL SCIENCE 
TEXTS. 
ONE of the charges against which General Science has 
been compelled to defend itself is that of superficiality. 
The criticisms have been met by alleging a different point 
of view. If superficiality consists of leaving off the alter- 
nate theories, inferences, exceptions to rule, qualifying ex- 
planations, and other minutiz, then perhaps General Sci- 
ence is superficial. But if precise, though brief, explana- 
tions of the more important phenomena of Nature, pre- 
sented in simple, unornamented statements easy of com- 
prehension by the adolescent mind, are considered more 
suitable in the texts to be placed in the hands of children, 
then General Science is adequately treated. 
The number of pages devoted continuously to a single 
topic is-available from the cards on which the original en- 
tries were made in the examination of the eighteen texts 
(Chapter II.), and will be in multiples of half pages. In 
a given text not only is the typical size of the continuously 
treated topics significant, but also the distribution of these 
sizes above and below the median. Two texts might show 
the same value for the median size of their topics; but the 
separate measures of one text might conform closely to this 
central tendency, while those of the other text varied widely 
from it. Therefore the upper and lower quartiles are 
given, also the median deviation (P.E.). These data are 
set out in Table IV. 
These tables show that General Science is presented in 
the form of small unit topics two or three pages in extent. 
The highest median is only 7.5 pages, found in the treat- 
ment of Physiology in text A. Of the 2,214 continuous 
topics in the eighteen texts, only 71 are in excess of ten 
pages and only 14 in excess of twenty pages. The median 
deviation is rarely over two pages, usually one page or less. 
Only four texts out of eighteen and only one science (Phys- 
iography) contain topics of a median size of three pages 
or more. It is apparent that the authors of General Sci- 
ence texts are in decided agreement as to this phase of the 
presentation of their subject-matter.

  CHAPTER VI. 
THE DISTRIBUTION OF SCIENCES IN GENERAL 
SCIENCE TEXTS 
To CARRY out the spirit of General Science—to be truly 
“‘general’’—the special sciences should be fairly evenly dis- 
tributed over the pages of each General Science text, indi- 
cating that as each topic is developed, the related facts from 
all sciences are linked together into the unit project. Even 
a superficial examination of the texts reveals the fact that 
the lines of “‘special science’’ are not obliterated—the marks 
of the old divisions, like ancient shore lines, may be plainly 
discerned. It seems to have been impossible to pulverize 
many hard lumps of physics, physiology, etc.; and there are 
places where a browsing reader, covering a dozen pages, 
would think that he had picked up a text on chemistry, 
physiography, biology, etc. 
To quantitatively measure the evenness of distribution 
which may be characteristic of each special science in each 
of the eighteen texts, these texts are divided into ten equal 
portions. Each portion will contain from 0% to 100% of 
the subject-matter of a particular science in that text. An 
ideal distribution would be found if 10% of the space al- 
lotted to the science should occur in each of the ten por- 
tions—in fact, this would obviously be 100% distributed— 
i. e., as widely distributed as possible. On the other ex- 
treme, if all of the discussion of a certain science should be 
concentrated into one of the one-tenth portions where only 
10% of it should be found, it is obvious that only 10% of 
the distribution is correct. 
The arbitrary selection of ten divisions merely gives a 
convenient and appropriate fractional part; any other por- 
tion would have been usable. Smaller divisions would give 
more refined data, but extreme minutiz would have been 
little, if any, more instructive in the tables which have been 
computed. 
Derivation of the formula 
100000 
S( %) 
in which S( %o*) represents the sum of the separate per 
cents of a science in each of the one-tenth portions of a text. 
The Distribution Per Cent of a science in a certain text 
is a measure not only of the number of different parts into 
which the science is divided, but also the size of these parts. = Per Cent of Distribution,  
-P-A-G-E-27
    
Distribution of the Sciences in General Science 27 
The further the per cent of a science in a one-tenth portion 
of a text deviates from an ideal 10%, the poorer the distri- 
bution. These differences are brought out in correct pro- 
portion by representing the respective per cents as areas— 
that is, by plotting the percents on a line and squaring them. 
‘A perfect distribution would be represented by a line di- 
vided into ten equal parts, with squares erected on each divi- 
sion, the resulting rectangle having an area of 1000 per cent 
units, since the base of each square represented 10%. 
An imperfect distribution is illustrated by a case chosen 
at random—the distribution of the science Household Arts 
in text B.

A line is divided in the proportion of the per cent of the 
science which is found in each of the one-tenth portions of 
the text. A zero per cent of the science in any portion is, 
of course, represented by a section of line zero points in 
length. Squares are erected on each of the divisions of the 
line, and the areas of these squares added. 
The portion of the science which is properly distributed 
is then compared with this area (2606.1), to which it bears 
some simple ratio. This fraction is the degree of distribu- 
tion in relation to the ideal distribution of 10% of the sci- 
ence in each one-tenth division of the text. To convert the 
fraction into percentage, the numerator is multiplied by 
100. Substituting in the formula, 
100 « 1000 hook ——____— = 87.9%, the Per Cent of Distribution of 
2606.1 Household Art in Text B. 
Proof of the formula. Three other examples will illus- 
trate the working of the formula. Given the distribution 
of a science as

The answer is obviously correct, as the distribution is per- 
fect.

The answer is correct, as the science has obviously been dis- 
tributed only one-half as efficiently as it might have been. 
Distribution of less than five pages. Since one-half page 
is the smallest unit recorded in this study, it is impossible 
to apply this formula to the few cases where less than five 
pages is devoted to a certain science in a text. To complete 
the table, a close approximation of the per cent of distribu- 
tion in such cases is calculated in the following manner. 
Just as it is possible to distribute 5 pages into ten divisions 
of one-half page each, 4.5 pages may be divided into nine 
such portions, 4 pages into eight portions, etc. If the total 
amount of a science present in the text is four pages, and 
is concentrated into one-tenth of the text, when it might 
have been distributed in eight of these portions (one-half 
page in each), its distribution is evidently 12.5% of the 
best that was possible. If the science is found in two of 
the one-tenth portions, the distribution is 25%, etc. 
This principle will be illustrated by a table of the full list 
of possible distributions of a science with two pages, and 
another with two and one-half pages of space in a certain 
text.

Distribution of the Sciences in General Science 29 
It is apparent that these percentages fairly represent the 
degree of distribution in comparison with the most per- 
fect distribution possible in each case of from one-half to 
four and one-half pages of a science in a text. The few 
Distribution Per Cents in Table V. which it was necessary 
to calculate by this method are all indicated by a sign (*). 
The Per Cents of Distribution, and data from which they 
have been computed, are recorded in Table V. for each sci- 
ence in each text. The texts are ranked in the order of the 
average Per Cent of Distribution for all the sciences; the 
sciences are ranked in each text in the order of their respec- 
tive Per Cents of Distribution. A summary shows the gen- 
eral rank of the sciences in all texts as to distribution. 
It appears that the authors of General Science have found 
it least difficult to scatter the subject-matter of Physics over 
the pages of their texts, linking the phenomena of that sci- 
ence with the topics of the others. The distribution of 
Physics in Text K (80.1%) is the highest found for any 
science in any text. But the average rank for the distri- 
bution of Physics (52.4%) greatly exceeds that of the next 
highest science, Physiography (33.5%), showing that in 
this and the remaining sciences a condition of real “gen- 
eral” distribution is not even approached. This is not due 
to any purely accidental value for the averages calculated ; 
for when the distributions for the sciences in each text are 
averaged, a remarkable uniformity of treatment is dis- 
closed. The extreme range between Text N, 34.8% aver- 
age distribution, and Text R, 22.8% average distribution, 
is only 12%. The grand average of 29.7%, therefore, 
closely represents the general distribution in all texts, show- 
ing that no author has radically departed from the estab- 
lished method of grouping the fields of science under the 
traditional headings. A widely scattered, ‘general’ dis- 
tribution may not be the chief desideratum of a General 
Science text; it may not be even one of the more important 
principles in the selection and arrangement of its subject- 
matter; but claims of the advantages which General Sci- 
ence texts and General Science courses possess over the 
texts and courses of ‘special science” due to this wide dis- 
tribution have been repeatedly made, and it has been inter- 
esting to determine to what extent, both in the individual 
texts and in the sciences of each text, these claims are valid.

CHAPTER VII. 
CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE SCIENCES AS TO VARIOUS 
PHASES OF THEIR TREATMENT IN GENERAL SCIENCE. 
CERTAIN questions now arise in connection with the 
great inequalities in the treatment which the different sci- 
ences receive in General Science—for example, the marked 
predominance of Physics as to space and distribution com- 
pared with the decidedly inferior standing of Astronomy, 
one of the oldest, and Household Arts, one of the newest of 
sciences. Is there any fundamental connection between 
any two sciences which causes them to rise and fall together 
in their ranks? Or do certain sciences receive prominence 
at the expense of certain others? It has been claimed that 
Physics and Chemistry are a closely coérdinated pair—that 
Biology and Physiology, Physiography and Astronomy, also 
Household Arts and Physics, show strong relationships. 
It has likewise been claimed that Physics and Biology, 
Physiography and Biology, Physiography and Household 
Arts, and possibly some other pairs, are to some extent an- 
tagonistic, or competitive, and that where a General Science 
text might have an adequacy or an excess of one, the other 
would receive deficient treatment. 
Such relationships may be most accurately shown by com- 
puting the correlations between the sciences in pairs, using 
a formula which takes into account not only the ranks, but 
also the quantities involved in each measure of a distribu- 
tion of ranks. Pearson’s Coefficient of Correlation is used 
to show the relationships set out in the following tables.! 
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SCIENCES AS TO SPACE 
IN THE TEXTS. 
In comparing the rank and quantity of each science as to 
space in the eighteen texts with each other science, 36 co- 
efficients of correlation may be worked out, eight of them 
being identities. (Correlation, +1.) 
Strong positive correlation would indicate a “pairing” 
of the two sciences, exerting mutual influence over each 
other’s rank.- Any author who gave a large space to one 
would give a proportionally large space to the other, and 
vice versa.

Correlations Between the Sciences 35 
Strong negative correlation would indicate antagonism 
between the two sciences, and an inverse ratio as to the 
space received. 
Weak correlation would indicate the lack of any funda- 
mental relationship between the two sciences, the ranks 
and quantities of each science being independent of the 
other. 
In Table VI. there are 36 correlations between pairs of 
sciences, eight of them identities (+1.), fifteen positive, 
thirteen negative. Most of the values are low, only the cor- 
relations between Physics-Chemistry (+.517) and Physics- 
Household Arts (+.590) being sufficiently strong to indicate 
a pairing—a rise and fall together as to space in the indi- 
vidual texts. In respect to all other pairs, the absence of 
any general underlying principles of codrdination between 
the sciences in determining the amount of space they are 
given in General Science texts is demonstrated.

  CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SCIENCES AS TO PER CENT OF 
DISTRIBUTION IN THE TEXTS. 
The remarkable uniformity in the average Per Cent of 
Distribution of the sciences for each of the eighteen texts 
(29.7%, with average deviation of only 2.9%) may be due 
either to uniform distribution of each science throughout 
all of the texts, or to widely varying, but compensating, 
per cents of distribution. The question then arises: Is 
distribution a quality inherent in a text—that is, does an 
author who distributes a certain science widely show pro- 
portionally good distribution in the other sciences, or vice 
versa? Or, comparing the sciences directly, is the wide 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 Science for the Grades 
distribution of a certain science, such as Physics, usually 
accompanied by the wide distribution of another science, 
such as Chemistry? 
If the answers to these questions are affirmative, strong 
positive values would be obtained in determining the cor- 
relation of pairs of sciences by Pearson’s formula. If, 
on the other hand, the wide distribution of one science, such 
as Physics, is obtained in most texts at the expense of the 
concentration of some other science, such as Biology, strong 
negative correlations would indicate the fact. 
In Table VII. there are 36 correlations between pairs of 
sciences—eight identities (+1.), fifteen positive, and thir- 
teen negative. The only positive value above .4 is in the 
correlation between Biology-Miscellaneous (+.500)—a rela- 
tionship without significance. A very moderate indication 
of pairing is shown in the correlation between Physics- 
Chemistry (+356). Stronger negative correlations are 
found in the relation of Physiography to several other sci- 
ences—Physics (—.368), Physiology (—.441), Chemistry 
(—.486), Astronomy (—.868). It appears that in those 
texts where the other sciences were widely scattered, Phys- 
iography was through some necessity concentrated, and vice 
versa. 
The values of these correlations are too low to admit of 
strong positive interpretations. The close agreement of 
the averages for the texts is evidently due to compensating 
values for the different distributions which each science re- 
ceived in the eighteen texts. The present status as to dis- 
tribution is clearly one of individualism. If in future texts 
the effective spreading of the topics of each special text 
throughout all portions of the book should become recog- 
nized as a necessary principle, the correlations will become 
positive and significant. If the tendency should favor 
larger groups of all recognized “special sciences,” . there 
would also be strong positive correlations. But if it should 
happen that Chemistry becomes more widely distributed 
throughout all texts because of its intimate relations to 
each of the other sciences, while Biology becomes more con- 
centrated for the sake of coherence, then strong negative 
correlations will be obtained between this pair. Such gen- 
eral tendencies would be clearly revealed by correlations, 
but their absence has been demonstrated in the data of Ta- 
ble VII.

CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PAGES AND THE 
PER CENT OF DISTRIBUTION OF EACH SCIENCE. 
One of the chief criticisms directed against General Sci- 
ence texts has been that the “hobbies” of the authors were 
evident—that large sections of some “special’’ science were 
included bodily in the text, violating the principles of gen- 
eralness which is supposed to characterize General Sci- 
ence. The defense has been that if the space devoted to a 
science was large in the aggregate, it was because numer- 
ous topics had been inserted wherever they were worth 
while—that extensive use of the particular science was due 
to its broad and varied relationships to the problems of 
daily life. The exceedingly scant and superficial attention 
paid to other sciences being also criticized, this has been ex- 
plained on the grounds that adequate treatment of all sci- 
ences is impossible—that the author has selected topics 
from the special fields in the proportion in which they most 
properly fit into the definite plan of his text, and thus the 
wisest possible choice from each science has been made. 
When the total amount of space devoted to the topics of 
each science is determined, the amount varies greatly in the 
different texts. Are the large totals due to the use of a 
greater number of small topics, or to larger masses of the 
“special” science? Is the prominent rank of a certain 
science as to space in General Science due to more extensive 
or more intensive treatment? Strong positive correlations 
between Space and Distribution of a science would indicate 
that the prominent treatment was characterized by the use
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 Science for the Grades 
of many rather than large topics, giving possible grounds 
for the charge of superficiality. Strong negative correla- 
tions would show that large space was usually poorly dis- 
tributed, and a basis for the accusation of “hobbies” would 
be furnished. 
In Table VIII. the correlations are positive in six sciences, 
negative in two, all but one being of low value. This ex- 
ception is in the science Biology (+.536), of which it is 
_characteristic that the texts giving the science most space 
tend to distribute it most thoroughly. This tendency, how- 
ever, cannot be characteristic of General Science as a whole, 
or the correlations in each science would have been more 
strongly positive. 
When the relationship of the sciences in the individual 
texts is considered by rank alone, it is seen that the science 
which ranks highest as to space usually is given the highest 
rank in distribution, and a science treated in a small num- 
ber of pages is likely to be found in one or two groups. 
Correlating the ranks of the sciences as to per cent of 
space occupied and per cent of distribution in each text 
separately by Spearman’s Rank Order Formula,! Table 
IX. shows perfect agreement in Text A, with positive 
correlations in all other texts, most of them exceed- 
ingly strong. The distribution which a certain science 
receives in one text is not a function of the importance of 
that science in General Science as a whole, but to its space 
in that text only. Neither is there any definite relationship 
between the actual number of pages a science may include 
in a text and its distribution; the agreement is in rank only. 
This further emphasizes the conclusion that no matter how 
much unity of plan an individual author may embody in his 
text, his arrangement is individual and original, and Gen- 
eral Science as a whole is not unified.

  CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SCIENCES AS TO ACCEPTABILITY

Is the proper selection of subject-matter inherent in a 
text? That is, if an author selects the topics of one sci- 
ence well, does he likewise exercise good discrimination in 
the case of the other sciences? If an author decides to be 
original and unconventional in his choice of the subject- 
matter he presents in one science, will his tendency be 
transferred to the other sciences included in his text? 
Uniformly good selection, uniformly poor selection, or 
uniformly mediocre selection of two sciences in all or nearly 
all texts would be indicated by a strong positive correlation 
between the ranks of their Acceptability Factors when com- 
puted by Pearson’s formula. But if good selection in one 
science was uniformly accompanied by poor selection of an- 
other science in all or nearly all texts, a strong negative cor- 
relation would be secured. 
Table X. shows 36 correlations—eight identities (+1.), 
twenty-five positive, and three negative. In these negative 
values the Miscellaneous group constitutes one of the pair; 
hence these correlations are not significant. Of the twenty- 
five positive values, ten are strongly so, over +.500, and five 
moderate, between +.400 and +.500. The low positive val- 
ues are in Miscellaneous and in Chemistry, except where the. 
latter correlates fairly high with Physics (+.472).. 
These values show a very strong tendency for a conserva- 
tive text to make equally appropriate selections of the topics 
of each important science—a poor, or bizarre, text to be uni- 
formly unconventional. The former tendency is the prin- 
cipal one, for twelve of the eighteen texts have Acceptability

a hodgepodge of unrelated topics, the Acceptability Fac-

zero.

CHAPTER VIII. 
THE ADAPTABILITY OF GENERAL SCIENCE IN THE LAST 
THREE GRAMMAR GRADES. TEST TOPICS. 
WITH very few exceptions, General Science courses are 
intended for the use of pupils in their first high-school year. 
Of the eighteen General Science texts examined in the 
spring of 1919, only one was admittedly designed for the 
grades. It is a fact, however, that in many places a Gen- 
eral Science course is given in one of the years which con- 
stitute the Junior High School, seventh or eighth grade, 
one of the simpler texts being presumably used. 
It is by no means a generally accepted principle that Gen- 
eral Science should be placed exclusively in the High 
School—that it is unsuited for the grades. In the great 
reorganization which world events are forcing upon the 
methods and curricula of schools, in which the demand for 
a useful knowledge of environment is drowning out the de- 
fensive arguments for courses of abstract and remoter 
value, more than one voice speaks for an earlier introduc- 
tion to Nature by instruction in her simpler principles 
given to children even in the lowest grades. 
Certain important principles in the selection of subject- 
matter for science instruction in the grades may only be 
determined by experiment. There is excellent agreement 
among authors of General Science texts as to the suitabil- 
ity of a large number of the topics of the five principal 
sciences (Table III.) ; but could the same subject-matter be 
used in the grades, even in simple form? For example, 
could the meteorological causes of winds and storms (17 
texts), the types of energy, momentum, inertia, etc. (15 
texts), the botany and chemistry of photosynthesis (16 
texts), the chemical composition of the atmosphere (16 
texts), be explained to sixth-grade children in a manner 
which would really result in their assimilation and under- 
standing of the principles involved? 
For science instruction in the grades, may topics from 
the five principal sciences be used in equal amounts? May 
they be used in the same proportion as they now occur in 
General Science, or in some other proportion suggested by 
experiment? } 
May suggestions be obtained from experimental evidence 
as to the assimilability, or average amount of possible un- 
derstanding, which children will show to each of the five
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 Science for the Grades 
principal sciences in the grades, to determine if this assimi- 
lability is uniform? 
If assimilability is not uniform, which science should 
predominate in the instruction in each grade? What are 
the relative amounts of the other sciences which may be 
acceptably included in that grade? If a certain science, 
such as Chemistry, is not suitable for instruction in the 
sixth grade, in which grade may its topics be profitably in- 
cluded? 
These and many other questions have prompted the study 
which follows: 
SELECTION OF THE TEST TOPICS. 
Table I. shows that the subject-matter of General Sci- 
ence has been principally obtained from five sciences. It 
was planned to select 25 important and characteristic top- 
ics from each of these sciences, choosing only those which 
occur in a clear majority of the texts. In Physics there are 
more than 25 topics each of which is found in ten or more 
texts; in the other sciences there are less than 25 such top- 
ics. The Zodlogy section of Biology contains no topic in- 
cluded in ten texts; but to avoid eliminating the subject 
altogether, five leading topics were chosen from Zodélogy, 
which, added to 20 topics from Botany, fills out the quota 
for Biology. 
In choosing the particular fact of science upon which the 
statements of the “test topic” were to be based, a minute 
division of each topic was made by examining the half-page 
cards from which the data of Table I. and others had been 
compiled. These subtopics were recorded, and ranked ac- 
cording to the number of texts in which each was treated. 
For example, the first topic of Physics, Transfer of Heat 
(18 texts), is composed of the subtopics Convection (16 
texts), Conduction (15 texts), Types of Furnaces (15 
texts), Radiant Heat (14 texts), Practical Ventilation (11 
texts), and nine other items of minor rank. Since but one 
subtopic is to be selected, and that must be the one most 
prominently treated, the choice falls upon the principles of 
Convection, which is discussed in the largest number of 
texts. In a similar manner the most important subtopic 
of each of the 25 most highly ranked topics in Physics was 
selected. 
In the other sciences, where less than 25 topics were in- 
cluded in a majority of the texts, it was necessary to select 
two or more subtopics from the topics which had the great- 
est number of pages. For example, in Physiography three 
subtopics each were chosen from the first three topics, since
-P-A-G-E-43
  Adaptability of General Science 43 
these contained more pages than the others, and two sub- 
topics from each of the remaining eight topics, making 25 
in all. In determining which three subtopics were most 
prominent in the topic—that of Humidity and Precipita- 
tion (17 texts), for example—the component items were 
found to be General Cause of Humidity (17 texts), Rain 
(17 texts), Snow (16 texts), Clouds (16 texts), Dew (11 
texts), Frost (11 texts), and nine other minor ones. The 
three subtopics chosen were Rain and Snow, Clouds and 
Fog, Dew and Frost, since these were clearly predominant 
and occur in a majority of the 17 texts mentioning Hu- 
midity. : 
In a similar manner, all of the 125 “test topics,” 25 from 
each of the five principal sciences, were selected. The num- 
ber of test topics chosen from each important topic of a 
science is recorded in a column in Table I. These subtop- 
ies are those which rank highest in their respective topics ; 
the topics are the most important of their respective sci- 
ences; all (except five in Biology, from the Zoédlogy divi- 
sion) occur in a clear majority of the eighteen texts. It is 
believed that this method has resulted in the selection of 
test topics thoroughly characteristic of each science, each 
topic representing the most favorable judgment of more 
than a majority of the authors of General Science texts as 
to its fitness to be presented as a part of the instruction 
in his text. 
Following a special study of the texts as to language and 
treatment of each selected topic, the test which was to be 
put into the hands of the children was prepared, consisting 
of a little folder of four pages fastened together.

A question designed to discover whether the child already 
has a knowledge of the principles of the test topic. This 
question was direct, simple, and usually covered one point 
only. If answered correctly, it would be evident that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 Science for the Grades 
child possessed some apperceptive basis for the further con- 
sideration of the particular topic involved. If answered in- 
correctly, it would appear that the child either had no pre- 
vious conception of the subject or was unable to express 
one. The data obtained from the answers to this question 
were expected to be a measure of the foundation of previous 
knowledge upon which instruction in General Science in 
the grades might be built.1 
Page 3. 
A direct statement, in which the facts and principles of 
the test topic were set forth as clearly and simply as possi- 
ble. While a strict composite of the discussions in the ten 
or more texts was impossible, the statement was carefully 
worded after a study of the language of each text. Illus- 
trations accompanied this paragraph in thirty-five in- 
stances. 
Page 4A. 
One or more direct questions, calling for the specific in- 
formation given on the preceding page. A correct answer 
would be evidence that the child has been capable of under- 
standing the subject-matter of the statement; and the fur- 
ther inference is not unreasonable that similar statements, 
equally characteristic of the science and of approximately 
the same degree of complexity, might also be assimilated 
by the child. An incorrect answer, or no answer, might 
indicate that the topic was apparently too complicated for 
the child’s understanding, and that he would probably have 
difficulty, or fail completely, in the assimilation of similar 
topics in that science. 
Page 4B. 
One or more questions, based on the specific information 
of the statement on page 38, but involving a further step of 
reasoning along some closely related line. A correct an- 
swer would indicate that the child not only understood the 
topic, but was able to apply its principles to the solution of 
another problem such as might be next propounded by text 
or teacher in ordinary recitation. An incorrect answer 
would warrant the conclusion that the principles of the 
statement, even if understood by the child, were in isolated 
position in his mind, and not sufficiently correlated with his 
apperceptions to be of practical value.

Lines for the grade, name, and age of the child headed 
each sheet, so that they could be identified if separated. 
Special effort was made to avoid questions which could 
be answered by mere “yes” or “no,” or in which the choice 
of one alternative without explanation would suffice, the 
laws of chance predicting correct answers in 50 per cent of 
such cases. The use of certain words, familiar enough to 
adults, but possibly strange to the child, such as “explain,” 
“illustrate,” “describe,” “discuss,” etc., was discarded in 
favor of the simpler phrases, “Tell about it,” “What is,” 
“Why is,” ete. 
It is fully realized that in some instances the wording of 
the statement and questions might have an undue influence 
for correctness or incorrectness of the answers. This con- 
dition is minimized in two directions, however: first, the 
language, in practically every case, is essentially that of 
one or more texts, simplified as to words or difficult phrases, 
or at least is as typical of all texts as a close study was able 
to determine; second, in twenty-five test topics for each sci- 
ence a few statements or questions of more than the average 
difficulty would probably be compensated by a few of abnor- 
mal simplicity. The combined results for all twenty-five 
test topics would thus be a fair measure for the science as a 
whole. 
With each package of test topics sent out, letters to teach- 
ers explaining the spirit of the test were inclosed, and also a 
page of specific directions. The number of minutes which 
were to be allowed a child for writing answers to each ques- 
tion, and for studying the statement, was determined by 
some preliminary experiments in the Demonstration School 
of George Peabody College for Teachers. The object was 
to give sufficient time for even slow pupils to finish, and the 
indicated periods were found to be ample. 
DIRECTIONS TO THE TEACHER. 
+ (This test is for the last three grammar grades only.) 
In order that there may be uniformity in the methods by which 
this test is given, it is requested that the teacher in charge of the 
pupils use the method and wording below: 
Step 1. 
(The teacher should see that each child has a pencil, and that the 
teacher has a watch or can see a clock.) 
Teacher (to children) : “Girls and boys, here is a new game. I am 
going to have placed on each desk some shéets of paper, face down- 
ward, and you must not touch or handle them until I tell you to.” 
(Have the sets, four small pages each, quietly distributed, face 
downward.)
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 Science for the Grades 
Step 2. 
Teacher (to children) : “Now turn the whole thing over, and let us 
read the rules together.” (The reading should be done in concert, or 
by the teacher, plainly and with emphasis, the children reading si- 
lently.) The rules— 
TO EACH BOY AND GIRL: 
This is a game to see how well you can remember. Here are the 
rules: 
1. DO NOT TURN ANY PAGE OVER, OR LOOK AT IT, UNTIL 
THE TEACHER TELLS YOU TO DO SO. 
2. WHEN THE TEACHER TELLS YOU TO, WRITE ANSWERS 
TO THE QUESTIONS. 
38. ON ONE PAGE THERE IS SOMETHING TO READ. TRY 
TO REMEMBER IT IF YOU CAN. 
4. DO NOT LOOK AHEAD, AND DO NOT LOOK BACK, AT 
ANY PAGES. 
Step 3. 
Teacher (to children) : “Now turn the first page over. Write your 
grade, name, and age on the first line. Then answer the question 
or questions below if you can. I will tell you to stop in just two min- 
utes. If you finish before that time, sit quietly, and do not turn any 
pages.” 
(Allow exactly two minutes for the writing.) 
Step 4. 
Teacher (to children): “Now turn the page over. You must not 
turn it back again. Write your grade, name, and age. Read what 
is written on this page, and try to understand and remember it. Do 
not turn the page until I tell you to. You will have two minutes to 
study.” 
(Allow exactly two minutes for study.) 
Step 5. 
Teacher (to children) : “Now turn the page, and do not turn it back 
again. Write your grade, name, and age on the first line. Answer 
the questions if you can. I will stop you in four minutes; but if you 
finish before, sit perfectly still, and do not change what you have writ- 
ten. 
(Allow exactly four minutes for this writing.) 
(The papers should now be promptly collected without alteration.)

Page 3. CONVECTION CURRENTS.  (Illustrated.) 
Statement: Whenever air becomes warmer, it expands; and be- 
cause this makes it lighter, it rises.. Cold air contracts, is heavy, and 
falls. In a room the warm air goes to the ceiling, while cold air 
comes in along the floor. 
The same thing is true of water. If a bucket of water is heated, 
the warm water goes to the top, and cold water to the bottom. 
This movement of air or water, due to a difference in temperature, 
is called “convection.”

Question 1. Rain, or snow, is water falling from the sky. How 
does the water get up into the sky? 
  Page 3. RAIN AND SNOW. 
Statement: As warm air blows across oceans and lakes, it gathers 
much water vapor from their surfaces. The winds blow this moisture 
over the land in the form of clouds. The tiny drops of water which 
form the cloud gradually make larger drops by running together, and 
fall to the ground as rain. 
If the moisture in the cloud freezes before it starts to fall, it comes 
to the ground as snow.

Page 3. THE FORMATION OF STARCH IN PLANT LEAVES. 
Statement: Leaves are the food makers for the plant. Two sub- 
stances unite in the leaves: (1) The carbon dioxide gas from the air; 
(2) water coming through the roots and up the stem. 
These two substances unite in the leaves to form starch. This can 
only happen while the sun is shining. At night the starch which has 
been made during the day is carried to all parts of the plant. This 
is what makes the plant grow.

Page 3. THE CAUSE OF DISEASE. 
Statement: All catching diseases are due to tiny germs, which may 
live in our nose, our throat, our lungs, our intestines, our blood, and 
in other parts of our body. These germs get into our body when we 
do various things which are not healthy, such as drinking impure wa- 
ter, eating food on which flies have walked, drinking from cups that 
other people use, etc. In fact, if we carelessly handle anything that 
sick people have used, the germs from these sick persons may get into 
our. bodies and give us the disease,

Question 1. Why must fire in a stove have plenty of air before it 
will burn? 
Page 3. 
Statement: Whenever anything burns, it unites with oxygen gas 
from the air. Since only about one-fifth of the air is oxygen, a sub- 
stance would burn more vigorously in a bottle of pure oxygen than it 
would in air. | 
Some substances, such as paper, wood, coal, etc., unite with oxygen 
very rapidly. These burn easily, and with much flame. Other things, 
such as iron, lead, and other metals, unite with the oxygen of the air 
very slowly, and become covered with rust.. Rusting and burning are 
similar processes, except that burning is a more rapid union with 
oxygen than rusting. In pure oxygen a hot iron wire would not rust, 
but would catch fire and burn.

CHAPTER IX. 
DISTRIBUTION AND SAMPLING OF THE TEST TOPICS. 
THE value of a study such as the one here undertaken 
increases with the number of individuals to whom the test 
is applied. In the present instance, circumstances made it 
necessary that all the grading, tabulating, etc., be done by 
the writer ; consequently the number of tests had to be con- 
fined within reasonable limits. On the other hand, it was 
realized that a sufficient number must be used to insure fair 
sampling. A goal of ten thousand replies was decided 
upon, which, if fairly distributed among the five sciences, 
would give approximately 2,000 tests for each. 
Letters were sent to 120 Superintendents of Schools in 
towns of not more than 10,000 or less than 5,000 popula- 
tion, as given in the Educational Directory for 1918. Sixty- 
two superintendents agreed to distribute the material to 
their teachers for use. The supply of test pamphlets, 125 
different kinds, was thoroughly mixed and mingled, and 
approximately 19,000 of them sent to these superintendents. 
Forty of them returned a total of 9,819 sets. The names 
of the cities and of the superintendents, to each of whom 
the writer feels personally indebted, follow:

In several of the States the “last three grammar grades” 
are numbered 5th, 6th, and 7th; in others, 6th, 7th, and 8th. 
Two methods of grouping their answers are possible—either 
considering the 5th, 6th, 7th grades in one set of schools as 
equivalent to the 6th, 7th, 8th grades of the other schools, 
or considering the 6th and 7th grades of both groups as 
equivalent and treating the 5th and 8th grades separately. 
An attempt was made to ascertain whether the curricula 
of the two types of schools would indicate which of the two 
methods was most appropriate, but expressions on the 
point were conflicting and largely a matter of opinion. It 
was decided, therefore, to avoid the responsibility of as- 
suming either side of the argument to be correct, and to 
record both sets of the last three grammar grades sepa- 
rately. It will not be difficult, if any one so desires, to 
combine the data of a table for any two grades considered 
equivalent.
-P-A-G-E-53
  Test Topics 53 
For purposes of identification, the 6th and 7th grades in 
the 5-6-7 grouping will be followed by the letter “x” in all 
future references; the 6th and 7th grades in the 6-7-8 group- 
ing will be followed by the letter “r.”’ These letters were 
derived from the words “xtra’”’ and “regular,” which were 
first used to keep the records of the two types separate. 
ANALYSIS OF THE SAMPLING. 
The 9,819 test sets returned represented exceedingly fair 
sampling, as indicated by the following tables: 
Grand Total, by Grades. 
     The higher grades in each group show slightly fewer re- 
plies, as expected. 
Grand Total, by Sciences. 
If the distribution had been perfect, each science would 
be represented by 1,964 answers. The number of answers 
received, and the deviation from this average, is recorded: 
    
  Science No. Answers Dev. 
Physiology ---- - 2032 +68 Physiography 2001 +37. Physics 1957 7 Chemistry 1933 :

The count shows a remarkable uniformity. The slight 
deviation is almost perfectly symmetrical. The extreme 
range out of nearly two thousand answers is only 136. 
The various deviations from the average of 1,964 average 
only 48, or 2.2%.

These data show that the tests were distributed with 
great uniformity to the separate grades, and that there is 
no marked excess or deficiency of answers in any science or 
in any grade. The fairness of the sampling seems to be 
thoroughly demonstrated. 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  54 Science for the Grades 
ANSWERS TO INDIVIDUAL TEST TOPICS. 
In each one of the six grade groups, children answered 
questions related to five sciences; which were presented un- 
der twenty-five test topics. Thus there are 6 x 5 x 25 — 750 
separate and distinct question groups under which the re- 
sults are recorded. Each of these 750 units constitutes the 
number of answers received for one test topic of one sci- 
ence in one grade. There is no reason to expect that each 
unit group would contain the same number of answers; on 
the other hand, by the laws of probability, there should be 
a normal distribution curve for the number of unit groups 
which would successively contain answers ranked in order 
from zero on upward. 
That the normal distribution is closely approximated is 
shown by the data in Table XI. The five divisions of the 
curve show the following distribution: 
Question groups answered by— 
5 Students 6-10 1-15 16-20 20 or More or Less * Students Students Students Students Total 
96 184 226 144 100 750 
12.80% 24.53% 30.13% 19.20% 13.33% 99.99% 
The curve is slightly skewed toward the left, or zero end. 
The median number of answers is 13—that is, half the unit 
groups include 13 or less answers and half include 13 or 
more answers. The quartiles are in the 8 and 16 group, 
which again calls attention to the slight skew toward the 
lower ranks. The curve shows three mildly prominent 
modes at the 9, 12, and 15 groups. 
The efforts to secure a perfectly random distribution 
seem to have been entirely successful.

CHAPTER X. 
ANALYSIS OF THE MARKS. 
THE letters A, B, and C were used in marking the tests. 
“A” represents a correct answer in which the student dis- 
plays a reasonable understanding of the topic, and expresses 
the idea in a manner which would be acceptable to the 
average teacher. ‘“B’ represents a decidedly inferior an- 
swer, a hazy conception evidenced by faulty or incomplete 
expression, leaving doubt as to whether there is really an 
appreciable understanding. The germ of the idea is recog- 
nizable, however. ‘C’ represents an incorrect answer, or 
no answer at all. Since the time allowed for writing the 
test was proved to be generous, the lack of an attempt is 
reasonably interpreted as inability on the part of the stu- 
dent to answer. In a few cases, where, in spite of strict 
prohibitions found in the instructions, the answers were 
obviously copied from the statement on page 38 of the 
pamphlet, a mark of “C” was given. 
METHOD OF GRADING. 
Each of the 29,457 questions were individually marked 
by the writer. They were taken in the unsorted order, just 
as received from the superintendents. In this way the pos- 
sibility of the mind getting into a certain “track” in mark- 
ing a large number of identical questions was avoided—a 
condition in which reasonable variations in answers might 
not be properly judged. Each mark was of necessity a 
matter of separate decision. Admitting the unquestioned 
fact that in a certain per cent of the cases a mark of A 
would be given where a mark of B or C was better justi- 
fied, the laws of probability would equalize the matter in 
the large number of judgments involved with the compen- 
sating error of substituting B or C for A in an approxi- 
mately equal number of cases. Further, the conclusions of 
this study are not based upon the minute data such as would 
be influenced by a small per cent of erroneous judgments. 
The grading was done almost continuously day after day, 
and thus the point of view remained reasonably constant 
throughout the entire time. No tabulations of any kind 
were made until after all the grading was completed. Thus 
it was impossible to tell the tendencies which were develop- 
ing or to receive any information which might bias the 
judgments in any way. 
The question had been asked of each superintendent as 
to whether the children had received any previous instruc- 
tion in General Science, the object being to discover whether
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 Science for the Grades 
any schools in which the subject was taught had been acci- 
dentally included in the list. Only one small group of 30 
pupils in the eighth grade of one school had elected such a 
course under an option. The answers of these pupils were 
compared with the marks of 30 others in the same school 
and grade, and no appreciable difference was noted. These 
test papers were then included in the general distribution. 
NUMERICAL COUNT OF MARKS. 
The numerical count of the marks for each of the three 
questions, the objects of which have been previously ex- 
plained, is recorded in Table XII. Certain general tenden- 
cies are roughly indicated by these results—that the num- 
ber of A’s and C’s are approximately equal, and either is 
more than one and one-half times the number of B’s. The 
A’s are more numerous in the higher grades, the C’s more 
numerous in the lower grades, as expected. Question 1, 
on Previous Knowledge, receives roughly 214 times as many 
C’s as A’s, while Question 2, on Direct Assimilation, has 
about 214 times as many A’s as C’s. In Question 3, on the 
Power of Application, the C’s predominate, but are only 
20% in excess. 
As to the separate sciences, the most noticeable feature 
is the decided difficulty which was experienced with Chem- 
istry, which in all three questions is markedly deficient in 
A’s and received C’s in excess. 
In all sciences the reactions of the children were least 
favorable toward Question 1, Previous Knowledge, which 
received fewest A’s and most C’s; and most favorable to- 
ward Question 2, Direct Assimilation, with most A’s and 
fewest C’s.

Analysis of the Marks 57 
Only the most roughly approximate conclusions may be 
drawn from these gross totals, however. The marks must 
be classified more minutely; and percentages, instead of ab- 
solute figures, used in order to equalize the differences in 
the number of answers received from each grade, or for 
each science. 
PERCENTAGE TABLES OF THE MARKS. 
The first assembling of the individual test papers for 
purposes of classification is by “unit groups” into which the 
papers of one grade, one science, and one test topic are col- 
lected. There are 750 such groups. In each test paper 
there are three questions marked, the significance of which 
has been previously explained. The median number of an- 
swers included in each unit group is 138, with variations 
from zero to 37, with practically normal distribution. 
The per cent of A’s, B’s, and C’s for each of the three 
questions was calculated for each unit group. Then the 
25 groups which comprize all of the questions in one sci- 
ence answered by the children of one grade were ranked, 
and the quartiles, median, and average determined. These 
figures, therefore, represent the characteristic reaction of 
the children in each separate grade to each separate science. 
This data is set out in Table XIII. 
The use of the per cent instead of the actual numerical 
count of A’s, B’s, and C’s in these answers equalized the 
variations in the number of answers in the different topics, 
the different sciences, and the different grades. For exam- 
ple, 100 A’s in a group of 200 is a much larger proportion 
than 100 A’s in a group of 300, although the numerical 
count is the same; a percentage alone expresses the true 
relation. 
The use of the median in recording the central charac- 
teristic value for these per cents neutralizes another possi- 
ble source of error which might affect the conclusions. 
Suppose certain questions have been grossly unfair, and 
not characteristic of the sciences they were supposed to 
represent. The replies would contain an abnormal per 
cent of correct or incorrect answers, depending on the un- 
natural ease or difficulty of the question. Each of these 
would greatly influence the average, but would simply form 
an extreme case where the median is used, not affecting its 
value more than one step at the utmost and having no 
greater effect on the nearest quartile. 
In the table the average is included for each case, and 
will show, by its deviation from the median, whether such 
uncompensated extreme cases exist. From the upper and
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 Science for the Grades 
lower quartiles those groups in which the cases are concen- 
trated in the higher or lower ranks, or those cases in which 
the distribution is more uniform, may be discerned. The 
most significant figures, however, are the respective me- 
dians, which record the reactions of the children in each 
science.

With one exception of very small value (6r-6x, Question

in the C’s are negative for all questions. Those in the B’s 
vary from positive to negative by small amounts. The

the medians of all grades in each particular science are re-

science to science, will show any exceptions to the general 
tendency for the average per cents to progress from sci- 
ence to science in the typical order. These averages and 
increments are recorded in Table XV. 
With one small exception (Physiography-Biology in Ques- 
tion 3), the increments of the A’s in the sciences ranked 
from Physiology to Chemistry are negative. With three 
exceptions, only one of consequence (Physiography-Biology, 
Question 3), the increments in the C’s are positive. The 
B’s vary in sign. In comparing Physiography and Biology, 
it is seen that the latter possesses a large excess of B’s, 
which explains the exceptions noted above. In all other 
respects the rank order of the sciences as given above seems 
to be thoroughly characteristic.

  66. Science for the Grades 
INTERPRETATION OF THE REACTIONS. GENERAL 
CHARACTERISTICS IN THE GRADES. 
Question 1. The Previous Knowledge of Children. 
Children of the fifth grade have very little information 
concerning even the simplest phenomena of science. The 
median per cent of correct answers received to questions 
which were designed to probe their minds for knowledge 
already possessed was zero for all sciences except Physiol- 
ogy-Hygiene, and less than 6% in that instance. There is 
an exceedingly small apperceptive foundation upon which to 
build General Science instruction in the fifth grade. 
In the sixth grades, information concerning the body, 
and health (Physiology), also land forms and the weather 
(Physiography), have become appreciably more familiar ; 
but the phenomena of Physics and Chemistry still are not 
matters of common knowledge. In the seventh grade, all 
of the sciences except Chemistry show reasonable medians, 
which, in the eighth grade, are slightly increased, with the 
exception of Physiography, which remains practically the 
same. Physiology-Hygiene is decidedly in the lead in these 
two grades, probably due, in many cases, to some definite 
instruction which has begun in that subject. 
It is difficult to arbitrarily determine the amount of pre- 
vious knowledge which could furnish a sufficient basis for 
beginning instruction in a particular science. Certainly 
it would seem unwise from this data to place ordinary top- 
ics of the five sciences before children of the fifth grade 
and expect them to really understand. The possibility of 
learning rules concerning any science by rote is, of course, 
admitted; but this is not the type of-instruction under dis- 
cussion. There are also the elementary types of “Nature 
Primers” and “Natural Science Readers” which have been 
often used in the fifth and lower grades; but this extremely 
simple treatment would hardly entitle the topics to be 
classed with the characteristic subject-matter of Physics, 
Physiography, etc., in General Science texts. 
_ If, for illustration, 15% be taken as a reasonable median, 
representing the per cent of a class of students which would 
have previous knowledge of a science, then the standard 
topics of Physiology-Hygiene and Physiography might be 
given in the sixth grade, and Physics and Biology added in 
the seventh grade. It is doubtful whether the almost total 
ignorance of Chemistry would permit a recommendation 
that it be included in even the eighth grade. As a general 
principle, there should be a modicum of apperception upon 
which to build a child’s knowledge in a science by instruc-
-P-A-G-E-67
  
  Analysis of the Marks 67 
tion, and, under the circumstances, the expediency of chem- 
ical instruction is seriously to be questioned in the grades. 
In all sciences the median per cents of C’s progressively 
decrease, with two slight exceptions, from the fifth to the 
eighth grade. They tend to confirm the inferences drawn 
from the distribution of the A’s, representing as they do the 
approximate reciprocals of the percentages of the A’s. 
Question 2. The power of Direct Assimilation possessed by 
children. 
It is believed that the child’s state of mind when answer- 
ing Question 2 of the test topic immediately after having 
studied a direct statement of some scientific fact closely 
approximates his state of mind when reciting to a teacher, 
or engaging in a written exercise, concerning topics which 
have been previously studied from a textbook. The advan- 
tage of recency, and of having but one topic to hold in mind, 
lies with this test; the disadvantage of dealing with an 
isolated topic, not linked with any project or lesson plan, 
is also a factor, which may compensate the advantage of 
recency. It is the belief of the writer that the conditions 
of the test favor as good, or possibly better, reactions from 
the children in the form of correct answers as would be 
found in the ordinary recitation or written exercise. If 
this be true, a reasonably high standard of median per cents 
for A’s in the answers of Question 2 may be set to indicate 
a satisfactory performance. 
Can any median for Question 2 in the fifth grade be con- 
sidered satisfactory? Would not a written test in any sub- 
ject which 36% or less of a class of normal children could 
pass be considered unreasonable? And if the pupils had 
just given diligent study to the points covered by the test, 
would not the subject-matter which had been assigned to 
them which could be assimilated by only 36% or less of the 
class be considered above their mental grasp? In the fifth 
grade, Physiology ranks highest with most A’s and fewest 
C’s, but the median is very low in comparison with other 
grades. Physics and Chemistry rank lowest in A’s, and the 
per cent of C’s is correspondingly high, showing that the 
inability of children to assimilate these topics is definite and 
positive. It does not appear that in the fifth grade the 
children are capable of really understanding any reasonable 
proportion of truly representative topics of the principal 
sciences. Here, again, the possibility of learning by rote 
or becoming interested in childish primers is admitted; 
but this study refers to the real subject-matter and princi- 
ples of science, expressed with simplicity, but based upon
-P-A-G-E-68
    68 Science for the Grades 
the topics which a majority of the authors of General Sci- 
ence texts considered indispensable. 
As a basis of discussion, let approximately 60% be des- 
ignated as a satisfactory median. If it is reasonable to 
expect that 60% of a class should pass the average test, 
then values less than this per cent would indicate subject- 
matter too difficult for their comprehension. It would then 
appear that the first definite science instruction would be 
properly given in the sixth grade, and would include the 
topics of Physiology-Hygiene and Physiography. The fields 
of Biology, and possibly Physics, could be drawn upon for 
characteristic information in the seventh grade. Physics 
is appropriate for the eighth grade, and Chemistry is barely 
over the line. The rank of Physics and Chemistry in this 
grade compared with the other sciences shows that they 
present far greater difficulties to children in the assimila- 
tion of their subject-matter. Any outline of simplified top- 
ics which pupils in grades below the eighth could pass over 
with high marks would probably have to eliminate some of 
the most definite and characteristic principles of these two 
sciences. 
Again, the C’s consistently decrease from the fifth to the 
eighth grades, coming to a vanishing point in Physiology, 
Physiography, and Biology. The low per cent of C’s in 
Physics and Chemistry encourage consideration for these 
sciences in the eighth grade, since the failures, in large pro- 
portion, are only partial. The excess of B’s in the eighth 
grade for each of these two sciences over the B’s for the 
other sciences is very marked. 
Question 3. The power of Application possessed by children. 
The surest test for a statement learned by rote is to at- 
tempt to use it as a basis for further questioning. There 
is no prominent fact of science that is not codrdinated with 
many other topics, usually in simple and obvious relation- 
ships. Question 3 of the test topic involved a step beyond 
the mere understanding of the statement presented to the 
child; it tested the genuineness of the child’s assimilation. 
In a good recitation a teacher follows the expressions of one 
pupil with a logically related question addressed to the same 
or another pupil, and each individual student, in his re- 
sponse, is supposed to reason from the statements of his 
predecessor. 
While an increase in the power of application from the 
fifth to the eighth grade is shown, it is not characterized 
by the regularity found in the answers from questions based 
on previous knowledge and direct assimilation. In the fifth
-P-A-G-E-69
  Analysis of the Marks 69 
grade the median per cents of A’s are low for Question 3, 
except in Physiology, this power of application being prob- 
ably due to the greater amount of previous knowledge pos- 
sessed in that subject. In the sixth and seventh grades a 
fair proportion of the children appear to be able to apply 
their knowledge in all sciences except Chemistry. The per 
cents for Physics and Biology remain practically station- 
ary for these grades, while Physiography shows a serious 
inconsistency between the median per cents in the 7r and 7x 
grades which has been verified, but not explained. The 
per cent of A’s for Chemistry does not reach accepta- 
ble proportions. Physiology-Hygiene alone has increased 
steadily, and has the highest rank at all times. 
In the eighth grade, Physiology still leads in A’s, although 
the pupils who are to be graduated in the 7x grade seem 
to have reasoned slightly better than those who will grad- 
uate in the eighth. Physiography has about the same 
status as in the seventh grade, while Biology has suddenly 
attained a satisfactory rank. Physics has also shown a 
marked improvement, though still ranking low. Chemistry 
still presents insuperable obstacles to the use of logical rea- 
son. The C’s show the same general decrease in the higher 
grades, while the B’s possess a uniformity which largely 
neutralizes their possible influence on the conclusions. The 
general results obtained from the question designed to show 
powers of application are nowhere inconsistent with the 
interpretations from the data on previous knowledge and 
direct assimilation. 
COMPARISON OF THE R AND X GRADES. 
Since the “last three grammar grades’ comprise two 
distinct groups—the 5th, 6th, 7th, and the 6th, 7th, 8th— 
in different schools, it is of interest to determine whether 
there is any appreciable difference in the reaction of chil- 
dren who have the same number of years to go before grad- 
uation. Using the tabulation of the median per cents of 
A’s from Table XIV., it is shown that better reactions are 
given by the children of the 6x and 7x grades in compari- 
son to those of the similarly numbered 6r and 7r grades. 
They do not rank as high as the corresponding grades meas- 
ured backward from graduation, the 7r and the 8th grades, 
the difference being greater in this comparison than in the 
first—that is, there is less difference between the grades 
numbered 6 (6r and 6x), also the grades numbered 7 (7r 
and 7x), than between the grades taken the year before 
graduation (6x and 7r) and the grades taken the year of 
graduation (7x and 8). Those who are graduating in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 Science for the Grades 
seventh grade are better able to understand the principles 
of science than the seventh-grade pupils of the other group, 
but are not as capable as those who are graduating in the 
eighth grade. 
The conclusions based upon the A’s are confirmed by the 
percentages of the C’s. The differences between the two 
sixth grades, also the two seventh grades, appear even less 
when the B’s are considered; for while the 6x grade has 
more A’s, the 6r grade has more B’s; the 7x grade has 
more A’s, the 7r grade more B’s. While it was appropriate 
to tabulate the results for the six grades separately, yet if 
a combination had been made, the grouping by numerical 
grades—i. e., 5, 6r-6x, 7r-7x, 8—would have more correctly 
represented the similar abilities of children. 
GENERAL COMPARISON OF THE PERCENTAGES IN THE 
SCIENCES. 
Examination of the average percentages for each science, 
all grades included, reveals two outstanding points. First, 
the decided ability of children above the fifth grade to mas- 
ter the characteristic topic of Physiology-Hygiene—a 
tribute, no doubt, to the efforts which have been made for 
many years to spread the gospel of health and sanitation to 
every one who is able to read. This fact, coupled with the 
definite personal relation which health has to the individual 
and the references concerning disease and its cause which 
are constantly made in every home, may account for the 
large amount of previous knowledge, the high assimilability, 
and the satisfactory response to further questioning shown 
in the grades studied. Second, the apparent inability of 
the same group of children, even in the eighth grade, to 
assimilate the typical facts of Chemistry, is equally strik- 
ing. The previous knowledge which children in the grades 
studied may have of Chemistry is only one-eleventh that 
of their knowledge of Physiology. Their power of assimi- 
lation is only one-half, and their power of application is 
only one-third in the same connection. 
In these same three particulars the sciences of Physiog- 
raphy, Biology, and Physics rank in the order mentioned. 
In previous knowledge their differences are very moderate, 
the typical per cent being approximately two-thirds that of 
Physiology. In direct assimilation, Physiography is al- 
most as suitable as Physiology, Biology ranks considerably 
lower, while Physics is but little more appropriate than 
Chemistry. In the power of application, Physiography and 
Biology are almost identical in rank, while Physics again 
presents serious difficulties.

SUMMARY OF INTERPRETATIONS. 
1. A representative list of the principles of science can- 
not be effectively presented to children of the fifth grade 
and below. They lack a sufficient apperceptive foundation 
of previous experience; they are not able to directly assimi- 
late any reasonable number of characteristic ideas of sci- 
ence and express them again; their. minds have not suffi- 
ciently developed so that.powers of logical reasoning might 
be expected. 
2. In the sixth grade, Physiology and Physiography alone 
seem to be suitable for science instruction. There is a rea- 
sonable amount of previous knowledge possessed by chil- 
dren in this grade, and the characteristic and fundamental 
topics of these sciences seem to be satisfactorily assimi- 
miner a logically applied according to the standards sug- 
gested. 
8. In the seventh grade, Biology, and possibly a most 
elementary treatment of Physics, becomes appropriate ac- 
cording to similar standards. 
4. In the eighth grade, Physics is acceptable for instruc- 
tion according to similar standards. 
5. That Chemistry is of doubtful value for instruction in 
any of the grammar grades, since its percentages in pre- 
vious knowledge, direct assimilation, and power of applica- 
tion, all fall below the suggested standards, which are easily 
attained by children of some grade or grades in the other 
sciences.

  CHAPTER XI. 
AN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPLETE REACTION OF 
CHILDREN TO SCIENCE. 
A sTupy of these data is not complete when the mere re- 
sults are tabulated. The psychological aspect of the prob- 
lem—the “reaction” of children of the last three grammar 
grades toward the presentation of the characteristic truths 
of science—involves not only how well they learn, but how 
they learn. 
Three successive steps have been considered as factors in 
the true assimilation of the principles of science. 
1. Previous knowledge, upon which to build the new con- 
ceptions. This necessity is fundamental to all learning, 
formal or informal, at all ages, and with every type of mind. 
2. Ability to assimilate plain statements, which involves 
association of the ideas contained therein with previous 
knowledge. The power to reéxpress the statement is also 
an integral part of this ability. 
3. The power to apply the information—to reason from 
the combined knowledge of the first two steps. This does 
not necessarily involve the development of further princi- 
ples; it may simply be a recognition of the same principle 
as applying to the new phenomenon or illustration. 
The data of the preceding pages show each of these fac- 
tors separately for each science and each grade. The mark 
of A, B, or C which a child received on his response to the 
test of previous knowledge had its proportional influence on 
the final tabulations for that particular phase; each A, B, 
or C received in the other two factors functioned in a sim- 
ilar manner. But by separately recording the three marks 
received for each child, his reaction has been split into three 
sections. 
With the total reaction of the child as a unit, three dis- 
tinct marks in the possible rankings from best to worst are 
immediately obvious. A child who received three A’s on 
his test paper could not possibly have done better; a child 
who received three C’s could not possibly have done worse. 
Three B’s would have been an exactly medium response. 
But there are twenty-seven combinations of the marks of 
A, B, and C in groups of three; and by the laws of chance, 
under no guiding influence, the marks of the 9,819 children
-P-A-G-E-73
  
  Analysis of Complete Reaction 13 
should have been equally divided among all twenty-seven 
combinations, and all shades of excellence should have been 
equally represented. 
But there were guiding influences, and strong ones, on 
the reactions of these children! An overwhelming number 
of these three-mark sets come under certain combinations. 
To find out what these influences are, and to interpret their 
cause and possible significance, is the purpose of this fur- 
ther study. 
RANK OF THE COMBINATIONS. 
The number of test papers marked under each of the 
27 combinations is recorded in Table XVI. The com- 
binations are ranked for each science in each grade; and 
to emphasize the upper measures, all combinations above 
the median are written in capital letters, those below the 
median in small letters. ‘Medians and quartiles are indi- 
cated.

There are three principal points to observe in each of 
these distributions. 
1. The amount of concentration of marks under a few 
combinations—a condition indicated by the height of the 
upper quartile and median. The ranks of the combinations 
below the median are not of much significance. 
2. The predominance of A’s, B’s, or C’s in the combina- 
tions above the median, and their occurrence in connection 
with the questions on previous knowledge, direct assimila- 
tion, or power of application. 
3. The rank of the perfect mark (AAA) and of complete 
failure (CCC). 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Fifth Grade. 
The concentration above the median is extreme, 51.3% 
of the answers (658 out of 1,239) being grouped in 14.1% 
(19 out of 135) of the combinations. In Chemistry, two 
combinations, and in Physics, three combinations, contain 
over half the answers. The C’s overwhelmingly predomi- 
nate in the marks for previous knowledge and for ability to 
apply, while A’s have a slight lead in direct assimilation. 
Total failure (CCC) leads in all sciences, and CBC, which 
is obviously only one step higher than total failure, ranks 
second except in Physiology. The children of this grade 
who are above the average intelligence are barely numerous 
enough to bring the perfect combination (AAA) above the 
median, its rank being fourth or fifth, except in Physics 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
  
Analysis of Complete Reaction 17 
and Chemistry, where its rank is 8.5 and 20.5, respectively. 
These subjects are in no sense suitable for fifth-grade in- 
struction. 
It appears that the extremely poor reaction of fifth-grade 
children to the presentation of characteristic topics of sci- 
ence is largely due to a lack of previous experience which 
might be utilized as an apperceptive basis. 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Sixth R Grade. 
The concentration above the median is great, 52.1% 
(1,079 out of 2,072) of the answers being grouped under 
17.8% of the combinations. The principal congestion is 
again in Chemistry and Physics. Questions on previous 
knowledge receive practically nothing but C’s, while the 
A’s have considerably increased their lead in direct assimi- 
lation, and are much more highly ranked, but do not pre- 
dominate, in the power of application. The B’s above the 
median are surprisingly few. Total failure (CCC) ranks 
highest, except in Biology, where it has given place to two 
better combinations. CBC has a prominent rank, either 
first or second, except in Physiology. Perfect response 
(AAA) has advanced its rank in all sciences—has almost 
reached the median in Physics (rank 5), but is still far 
away in Chemistry (rank 16.5). 
The improvement over the fifth grade is decided. In 
Physiology the very slight excess which CCC has over CAA 
and AAA indicates that perfection has practically caught 
up with failure. In Physiography and Biology the good 
combinations are not far behind the poor ones. In Physics 
and Chemistry the failures still greatly predominate. 
Children of the Sixth R Grade give satisfactory response 
only to Physiology-Hygiene and Physiography, except as 
to their previous knowledge, in which they are still deficient. 
The other sciences cannot be considered suitable for instruc- 
tion in this grade. 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Sixth X Grade. 
The concentration above the median is still great, 52.9% 
of ‘the answers (636 out of 1,201) being grouped under 
16.3% of the combinations. Previous knowledge still shows 
practically nothing but C’s; but the A’s are greatly in excess 
in direct assimilation, and are almost equal to the C’s in 
power of application. The B’s are still very scarce. In 
these respects the Sixth X Grade is but little different from 
the Sixth R Grade, but a decided advantage appears in the 
sciences of Physiology-Hygiene and Physiography, where 
perfection (AAA) has taken first place by a wide margin 
over failure (CCC) in the former and by a bare three an- 
swers in the latter science. In fact, Physiology-Hygiene
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 Science for ‘the Grades 
shows three of the best possible combinations in the three 
highest ranks. Perfection has not yet appeared above the 
median in Physics or Chemistry ; only the slightest improve- 
ment in the first rank of Chemistry is to be observed. 
The children of the Sixth X Grade, in the two sciences 
which seem to be most suitable for their study (Physiology- 
Hygiene and Physiography), are slightly more proficient 
than the children of the Sixth R Grade. Their responses 
are otherwise very similar. 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Seventh R Grade. 
Concentration above the median is still high, 52.8% of 
the answers (1,219 out of 2,305) being included in 17.8% 
of the combinations. C’s predominate in previous knowl- 
edge, but not to the extent that they do in the sixth grades. 
The A’s are in large excess in direct assimilation, and have 
become equal to the C’s in power of application. Practi- 
cally no B’s are included in the upper half of the marks. 
Biology joins the group of the sciences in which perfect 
marks (AAA) lead, and perfection (AAA) for the first 
time appears above the median in Physics. It is below the 
median only in Chemistry, ranking eleventh. In Physiology- 
Hygiene, complete failure (CCC) has fallen below the me- 
dian for the first time in any science, and it is barely above 
the median in Physiography and Biology. The only three 
combinations above the median in Physiology are the best 
possible ones, the whole upper 50% of the answers being 
concentrated in them. Biology also contains the same best 
three combinations, but the upper half of the answers is 
not confined to them. 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Seventh X Grade. 
Concentration above the median is still high, 53.9% of the 
answers (605 out of 1,122) being grouped in 17.8% of the 
combinations. Previous knowledge is very slightly better 
in Physics, Biology, and Physiography than it was in the 
Seventh R Grade, and much better than in the sixth grades. 
The A’s predominate in all sciences in direct assimilation, 
and are in plurality in the power of application in all sci- 
ences except Physics and Chemistry. The perfect group 
(AAA) leads in all sciences except Physics and Chemistry, 
and is absent from above the median in Chemistry only, 
ranking tenth. Absolute failure (CCC) has fallen below 
the median in all sciences except Physics, where it again 
ranks first by a very narrow margin of two answers over 
the quite acceptable combination CAA which holds second 
place. Again the B’s are very scarce. Other conditions 
vary only slightly from the Seventh R Grade. 
Children of the seventh grades give satisfactory re-
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  Analysis of Complete Reaction a9) 
sponses in all sciences except Chemistry, although Physics 
still presents serious difficulties. In Physiography, Biology, 
and Physics the good showing is made in spite of the small 
amount of previous knowledge, which is but little, if any, 
greater than that possessed by children of the sixth grades. 
The ability to make applications has considerably increased 
in the Seventh Grade. 
Rank of the 27 combinations in the Eighth Grade. 
There is extreme concentration above the median, the 
greatest found in any grade, 57.3% of the answers (1,077 
out of 1,880), being included in only 14.8% of the combina- 
tions. For the first time the predominance of C’s in pre- 
vious knowledge is not excessive. In direct assimilation 
the groups are exclusively A’s, except for one B in Chem- 
istry. The C’s are completely eliminated. There are twice 
as many A’s in power of application as there are C’s, with 
no B’s. . 
Perfection (AAA) leads in all sciences except Chemistry, 
but is found above the median for the first time in that sub- 
ject. Failure (CCC) has completely disappeared from the 
upper 50%, ranking 7.5 in Chemistry and about 10 in the 
other groups. BAA, an almost perfect combination, and 
CAA, but little less so, rank high in all sciences. In Phys- 
iology the response is almost perfect, with only the two best 
combinations above the median. 
Children of the eighth Grade give satisfactory reactions 
to all sciences except Chemistry. The children have not yet 
acquired, however, or have been unable to classify, the 
amount of previous experience which would seem desirable 
for best results in learning a science; but the condition is 
far better in the eighth grade than in any previous one. 
Characteristics of the sciences above the median: Phys- 
tology. 
The reaction to Physiology-Hygiene is good except in the 
fifth grade. Perfection (AAA) is always included as one 
of the combinations above the median, and leads in rank 
from the Sixth X Grade up, the excess being very marked 
in the seventh and eighth grades. Failure (CCC) leads 
strongly in the fifth grade, has a plurality of only one an- 
swer in the Sixth R Grade, is displaced in the Sixth X 
Grade, and disappears from the upper 50% in the seventh 
and eighth grades. 
Previous knowledge is fair only in the seventh and eighth 
grades. Direct assimilation and power of application rank 
perfect above the median in the seventh and eighth grades 
and almost perfect in the fifth and sixth grades. Phys- 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 Science for the Grades 
iology-Hygiene is obviously the most suitable of any sci- 
ence for instruction in the grades. 
Characteristics of the sciences above the median: Phys- 
iography. 
The response in Physiography becomes good in the Sixth 
X Grade, only the presence of a rather large group of fail- 
ures (CCC) lowering the suitability. In the Sixth R Grade 
the condition is not quite so good, as the failures (CCC) 
outrank the perfect marks (AAA). With the elimination 
of the failures from above the median in the seventh grades, 
the reaction becomes excellent. 
Characteristics of the sciences above the median: Biology. 
This subject in the fifth and sixth grades is less satisfac- 
tory than Physiography. The upper 50% of the answers 
are distributed over more different combinations, and there 
is a lower rank for perfection (AAA) and other more sat- 
isfactory combinations. These differences practically dis- 
appear in the seventh and eighth grades, in which perfec- 
tion takes first rank, the science being obviously suitable 
as a source of topics for instruction in these grades. 
Characteristics of the sciences above the median: Physics. 
In Physics even a fair reaction cannot be claimed until 
the seventh grade, when perfection (AAA) becomes one 
of the groups above the median; but the high per cent of 
failures (CCC) neutralizes a large part of this good influ- 
ence. The A’s are plentiful in direct assimilation, how- 
ever. In the eighth grade the general condition is good, 
the C’s having been practically eliminated from the direct 
assimilation and power of application groups. The topics 
of Physics seem, therefore, to be appropriate for instruc- 
tion in the eighth grade. 
Characteristics of the sciences above the median: Chem- 
istry. 
The reaction to Chemistry is poor in every grade. It 
can hardly be called fair even in the eighth grade, where 
perfection (AAA) first receives a rank higher than tenth. 
Of the 1,026 test papers in the groups above the median, 
answers in previous knowledge receive only 23 A’s and 28 
B’s. The C’s are three times as numerous as the A’s in 
the power of application. The low rank of the better com- 
binations rather discourages the inclusion of chemical top- 
ics for instruction in any grade.
-P-A-G-E-81
  
CHAPTER XII. 
RANK AND SCATTER OF THE TWENTY-SEVEN 
COMBINATIONS. 
It is instructive to know, in the’ case of any one of the 
triple mark combinations, how uniform its rank has been 
in the different grades in one science or in the different 
sciences in one grade. For example, CCC ranks first in all 
sciences of the fifth grade, but its relative rank is tenth in 
the eighth grade. AAA ranks highest in Physiology, Phys- 
iography, and Biology, but occupies the fourteenth place in 
Chemistry. 
The marked concentration of the answers under the head 
of certain combinations leaves other combinations with 
few, if any, answers. What these combinations are, and 
whether they are the same in different grades and differ- 
ent sciences, must be determined if the cause and signifi- 
cance of this uneven distribution is to be studied. 
If the ranks of a combination as it occurs in one science 
throughout all grades is averaged, a typical measure of the 
importance of that combination in the particular science 
is obtained. The average rank of a combination as it oc- 
curs in one grade, but including each science, is also a typ- 
ical measure of the importance of that combination in the 
particular grade. The average is chosen rather than the 
median, because of the small number of cases—six and five, 
respectively, in each science and grade—and the possible 
range of 27 units in rank. The data of these ranks are re- 
corded in Table XVII. 
When orders of rank are assigned in this manner for each 
combination, either from average or median figures, it is 
important to know whether the position is a result of the 
combination occurring uniformly in that rank (as where 
CCC ranks first in all sciences in the fifth grade), or 
whether it is merely the position determined by calculation 
from varying ranks (as where AAA in the Sixth X Grade 
occupies the fifth’ position, with an average rank of 6.4, 
which has been.calculated from two first ranks, one fourth, 
one fifth, and one twenty-first rank in the five sciences). 
The dispersion of the ranks from which the average is cal- 
culated is of value as an auxiliary to this definite average. 
The story of the man who was drowned while crossing a 
stream with an average depth of two feet is a simple illus- 
tration of the point. 
Ordinary measures of dispersion do not appropriately ap- 
ply here because of the small number of cases—five sci- 
ences, six grades. Extreme range only shows two of the
-P-A-G-E-82
  
82 Science for the Grades 
number; and if these ranks were 1 and 27, respectively, no 
hint of the location of the other three or four ranks would 
be disclosed. It is useless to calculate a quartile deviation 
from only five or six cases; the median deviation, the stand- 
ard deviation, and the average deviation are of doubtful 
value for the same reason. The formula 
100:S(d) -V S(@?) 
(n—1)? 
has been derived, in which d represents the differences in 
the successive ranks when in rank order. The steps in the 
derivation of this formula are as follows: 
1. In two or more series where the sum of the differences 
of the ranks in order is the same, but the size of these in- 
dividual differences is unequal and the scattering obviously 
not the same, if the differences are squared, added, and the 
square root extracted, the inequality is brought out. Ex- 
ample: 
Series 1,3, 5, 7, 9; differences, 2, 2,2,2;Sd=8; VS(@) =4. 
Series 1, 2, 3, 6, 9; differences, 1,1, 3,3; Sd=8; 1) S(d?) = 4.47 
Larger gaps in the ranks indicate a higher scatter, and 
the value 1 Sid) varies in direct proportion to the size of 
these gaps. 
2. Obviously the series 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, in which S(d) = 4, 
has less scatter than the series 1, 7, 14, 20, 27, in which 
S(d) — 26. The larger sum of the differences represents 
a larger scatter; therefore the quantity S(d) is a direct 
measure of the proportion of scattering. 
These two values, S(d)'v Sid) represent a rectangle 
which, when plotted, would have as one dimension the side 
of the square which would contain the sum of the areas of 
the squared differences, and as the other dimension the 
total range of the ranks. This area is a measure of the 
actual extent of scattering. 
3. This area may now be compared with the total possi- 
ble area of scattering, so that the scatter of any given set 
of ranks may be recorded as a proportion (fraction) or as 
aper cent. With 27 ranks, the largest possible sum of dif- 
ferences is 26, or n—1, where n = the number of ranks. 
The area which would represent this scatter is (n—1)?, and 
is the largest possible rectangle which could be constructed 
by any application of these differences. The ratio which 
the dispersal of any certain case bears to the largest possi- 
ble scattering is the quantity Sid) 1 Sid) 
@—l)? = % of Scattering
-P-A-G-E-83
  
The Twenty-Seven Combinations 83 
4. To convert this ratio into per cent, multiply the nu- 
merator by 100. The formula, therefore, becomes 
100-S(d) -1/ S(ay 1008 VSG) Per Cent of Scattering of Ranks. 
  (n=1)* 
In a given set of tables with the same number of ranks 
100 the quantity Ga) is a constant. With 27 ranks, ma 
100/676 — .146. For 25 ranks the constant is .174; for 20 
ranks, .277; etc. 
GRAPHIC PROOF OF THE FORMULA. 
1. Given a series, such as 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, with no scattering. 
S(d) is zero; therefore the formula gives a zero per cent 
of scatter. 
2. Given a series 1, 1, 27, 27, 27, where the ranks would 
have the greatest possible scatter from the average as cal- 
ee 100 x 676 x 26 culated. Substituting, ae == 100% Scatter. 
8. Given a series of ranks 1, 7.5, 14, 20.5, 27, in which 
the extreme range of 26 ranks has been divided into four 
equal parts—i. e., four equal steps of 6.5. It is obvious 
that this dispersal is symmetrical to the average, which is 
14, and is the exact median scatter for five ranks in 27 
cases. Plotting the rectangle for the scattering to scale 
will indicate the actual area of scattering; another rectan- 
gle may indicate the largest possible area of scatter with 27 
ranks. If these areas be superimposed, the ratio of rec- 
tangle 1 to rectangle 2 is 50%. This value is also given by 
calculation from the formula. 
The per cent of scatter from the average has been calcu- 
lated for the ranks of each combination in the separate 
grades, all sciences included, and for each combination in 
the separate sciences, all grades included. The values are 
recorded in Table XVII. 
In connection with either the median or the average, the 
per cent of scatter gives a measure of the degree to which 
the central tendency is truly representative. The per cent 
may be used where the number of cases is too small to per- 
mit the use of the customary measures of deviation. Even 
in a large number of cases the per cent of scatter may in 
certain instances be more instructive than these measures, 
since it presents a ratio rather than an absolute quantity— 
that is, it measures the amount of scattering in comparison
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 4 Science for the Grades 
with the largest possible scatter, rather than merely com- 
puting a value for it, which value is either an average or a 
median itself, and subject to all inaccuracies and disadvan- 
tages of these central tendencies. The gaps, whether lo- 
cated near the extremes or close to the central tendency, are 
measured with perfect equality, which is not true of any of 
the other measures of deviation, the average deviation be- 
ing unduly influenced by the cases near the extreme range, 
and the median deviation and the quartile range ignoring 
them.

COMBINATIONS. 
The twenty-seven combinations may be ranked in each 
grade according to the total number of answers received, 
disregarding the quota of the different sciences. They 
may also be ranked in each science according to the total 
number of answers received, disregarding the quota of the
-P-A-G-E-90
  90 Science for the Grades 
different grades. A glance at these totals as recorded in 
Table XVIII. shows the striking fact that certain combina- 
tions practically preémpt the three highest and the three 
lowest ranks, indicating certain major tendencies in the 
general reactions of children toward different sciences in 
the different grades. 
Examination of the three highest ranks for each of the 
grades shows that only six different combinations occupy 
eighteen possible positions. These combinations, and the 
number of times each occurs, are as follows: AAA, 4; CAA, 
3; CAC, 3; CBC, 3; CCC, 3; BAA, 2. It is apparent that 
the power of direct assimilation of subject-matter, repre- 
sented by the middle letters of these combinations, is not 
characteristically preceded by any appreciable amount of 
previous knowledge, the deficiency of which in these large 
groups of children is very striking. The power of applica- 
tion seems to appear. suddenly as an acquirement of the 
larger groups of children in the seventh and eighth grades, 
this ability being lacking in the fifth and sixth grades. 
The combinations most rarely met with, occupying the 
three lowest ranks, are only four in number for eighteen 
positions. Their distribution is as follows: ACA, 6; ACB, 
5; BCA, 5; BCB, 2. These combinations are exclusively 
those in which failure in direct assimilations is accompa- 
nied by partial or complete success in the other two phases 
of the reaction—previous knowledge and power of appli- 
cation. In other words, it is inconceivable that any appre- 
ciable number of children would possess the ability to rea- 
son further along a line of scientific explanation when the 
direct first premise was not understood. The results here 
tabulated thus confirm one of the best-known pedagogical 
principles—that reasoning cannot proceed from the un- 
known. It appears equally impossible that children should 
fail in direct assimilation, and at the same time possess a 
reasonable amount of previous knowledge of the topics 
which they were studying. The correctness of the tenden- 
cies shown in this part of the table needs no confirmative 
argument. 
In the sciences the fifteen positions in the three highest 
ranks are occupied by but six different combinations, dis- 
tributed as follows: AAA, 3; CAA, 3; CAC, 3; CCC, 3; 
CBC, 2;CAA,1. The general deficiency in previous knowl- 
edge, indicated by the first letter of the combinations, is evi- 
dent in all sciences. Ability in the power of application, 
indicated by the third letter of the combinations, is char- 
acteristic of these larger groups in certain sciences—Phys- 
iology, Physiography, Biology; but the lack of this power 
is just as striking for Physics and Chemistry. Ability in
-P-A-G-E-91
The Twenty-Seven Combinations 91 
direct assimilation is decidedly prominent in the large 
groups of children in the same three sciences, and lacking 
in the same two as mentioned. 
It appears that the reaction of children to a science shows 
the first evidence of success in response to direct statements 
and questions, and that both previous knowledge and ability 
to. apply are products of considerable experience. Facts 
apparently understood from the plain statements of teacher 
or text are likely to remain isolated, in the mind of a child, 
and unaccompanied by any previous knowledge or ability 
to reason in a distressingly large number of cases. 
The combinations rarely met with—seven different com- 
binations, occupying fifteen positions—are again those in 
which satisfactory previous knowledge and successful ap- 
plication would be accompanied by failure in direct assimi- 
lation. We would not expect a normal child to write such 
a paper, and the table shows that the children did not. 
This principle is true of any science, as it is of any grade.

  CHAPTER XIII. | 
CORRELATION OF THE RANKS OF THE COMBINATIONS. 
EXAMINATION of the ranks of combinations has thrown 
light upon certain specific tendencies in each grade and sci- 
ence which are characteristic of the reactions of children 
to topics of science; but there is no guarantee that the com- 
parisons between these grades and sciences are not the re- 
sults of mere coincidence, however much the evidence may 
point in the other direction. For example, it might be 
argued that the laws of chance have brought about the 
close agreement of the three upper and lower ranks as 
found in the different grades. It might be even more 
plausibly argued, pending investigation, that the agreement 
in the six ranks mentioned might be completely nullified by 
the disagreement in rank of the other twenty-one combina- 
tions. 
Again, certain extreme differences are obvious between 
the lower and upper grades. Are these differences in de- 
gree or in kind? Are they so great that the combinations 
which rank high in the fifth grade rank low in the eighth 
grade, and vice versa? Or are there fundamental princi- 
ples of learning which apply almost equally to any grade, 
high or low, which make certain combinations practically 
impossible under any conditions, and others equally sure to 
be characteristic of the reaction of children in any grade? 
The real nature and extent of the differences between 
grades is only to be measured by examination of the inter- 
mediate, as well as the extreme ranges of the ranks. 
It is expected that certain pairs of sciences will show 
much agreement in the position of their combinations, and 
that other pairs will show decided disagreement in the same 
respect. Which are these sciences, and what is the extent 
of their relation in each case? 
In some instances one step in rank is the result of a large 
difference in the number of answers falling under the two 
combinations; in other cases one answer alone comprises 
the step. These positions in rank, therefore, are not of 
equal significance. 
To discover and record all such qualifying instances in 
the tables of rank into which the combinations are distrib- 
uted in the different grades and sciences would require an 
unreasonable and unprofitable minutize in the treatment of 
these data. It is sufficient if the general comparisons are 
proved to be characteristic of the true status of the reac-
-P-A-G-E-94

tions of the children. Ranks of this type are best com- 
pared by means of the modified Pearson Coefficient of Cor- 
relation,! which is computed by the formula: 
S(xy) De ee pega: 
V SQ) 'V S(y’) 
in which x and y are the respective deviations from the 
medians of-the two distributions compared. This formula 
takes into account not only the rank, but the size of each of 
the measures. A high correlation between the ranks of the 
twenty-seven combinations in two grades of a certain sci- 
ence, or two sciences of a certain grade, would indicate a 
marked agreement in the order in which the combinations 
came and in the size of the steps between them; a strong 
negative correlation would indicate that the combinations 
which ranked high in one ranked low in the other, with ap- 
proximately equivalent steps. In either case some under- 
lying principle would be in evidence, and some profitable 
conclusion might be derived as an interpretation of the cor- 
relation. But if a value approaching zero were obtained 
for the correlation, it would be apparent that a haphazard 
arrangement resulting from the influence of the laws of 
chance was present. 
There are 465 possible correlations between these ranks 
for six grades and five sciences. The possible significance 
of each of these has been carefully studied, and the ones 
which have most bearing on the problems stated above are 
the correlations between the ranks of combinations in the 
different grades in each science and in the different sciences 
in each grade. This requires the computation of the coeffi- 
cient of correlation for one hundred and ninety-five pairs of 
ranks. The data is recorded in Table XIX. 
At the first glance, the exceptional strength of the corre- 
lations is to be observed. Every correlation is positive, 185 
out of 195 being strongly so—over +.500. According to 
Rugg,” a correlation of .60—.70, especially with as many 
cases as found in these comparisons, is decidedly high. If 
that interpretation be reasonable, then some of the correla- 
tions in this table indeed approach perfection. The rank- 
ings of the combinations in these grades and sciences have 
not been haphazard, nor under the appreciable influence of 
the laws of probability. The interpretations and compari- 
sons which may be made from these data are, therefore, 
founded upon fundamental principles rather than mere co- 
incidence in the arrangement of the ranks.

Correlations Between Combinations 95 
Of course, certain grades are more closely correlated 
than others. It would seem most reasonable, without 
proof, that if the grades are arranged in the order of their 
advancement—5, 6r, 6x, 7r, 7x, 8—as has been indicated 
by other data of this study, the coefficients of correlation 
would rank themselves in the order of the adjacency of the 
two grades compared—that is, as the 5th grade is corre- 
lated successively with the 6r, 6x, 7r, 7x, and 8th grade, the 
coefficients would successively decrease; or as the 6x grade 
was correlated with the others, the coefficient would have 
the greatest value in connection with the grades only one 
position removed in series (6r, 7r), a lower value with those 
grades two positions removed (5, 7x), and the lowest value 
with the grade three positions removed (8th). Out of 180 
correlations tabulated in Table XIX. for the sciences (each 
correlation except identities—+.1.00—appearing twice so 
that this condition could be easily seen), only 5 are excep- 
tions to this expectation, and are marked with a sign (*). 
From the arrangement of the combination of any science in 
the 5th grade to the arrangement of the same combinations 
in the 8th grade, there is a series of small successive differ- 
ences advancing through the intermediate grades in the or- 
der—5, 6r, 6x, 7r, 7x, 8—strongly confirming this order of 
the grades as determined by other data. 
The nature of the improvement in the reaction of chil- 
dren toward science, grade by grade, has already been crit- 
ically analyzed in Chapter XII., using the data of the three 
highest and the three lowest combinations in rank. These 
correlations show that whatever conclusions and compari- 
sons were made from the few combinations is solidly con- 
firmed by the distribution of the entire twenty-seven com- 
binations. 
Interesting confirmation of another relation is furnished 
by these correlations. In deciding whether the “last three 
grammar grades” in the two types of schools should be con- 
sidered on the basis of the proximity to graduation or by 
their numerical value, it has been demonstrated, by other 
data, that the latter method would combine the more simi- 
lar classes. This is confirmed by the following correla- 
tions, all of which are positive:

96 Science for the Grades 
In every science the 6th R grade correlates more closely 
with the 6th X grade than with the 5th grade. With but 
one exception, marked (*), and that by a quantity of .002, 
the 7th R grade correlates more closely with the 7th X grade 
than with the 6th X grade. In every case the 7th X grade 
correlates more closely with the 7th R grade than with the 
8th. This is a confirmation of the grouping previously 
determined as more appropriate—that is, grades 5, 6r-6x, 
Tr-7x, 8, rather than grades 5-6r, 6x-7r, 7x-8. 
It might be expected that in confirmation of the ranking 
of the five sciences in the order of their increasing diffi- 
culty as previously determined (Physiology, Physiography, 
Biology, Physics, Chemistry), that the sciences nearest each 
other in this rank order would show the closest correlation 
as to their combinations. Such proved to be decidedly the 
case, for out of 150 correlations between the different sci- 
ences recorded in Table XIX., only 15 are exceptions—that 
is, in the correlations between Biology and the other sci- 
ences, the highest correlations are with the sciences only 
one position removed (Physiography, Physics), and the cor- 
relations with the sciences two positions removed (Phys- 
iology, Chemistry) are less. When Physiology is corre- 
lated with the other sciences, the value of the correlation 
decreases successively from Physiography, the nearest to 
Physiology in rank, to Chemistry, the most remote. When 
the sciences are ranked in this order, therefore, the change 
in the arrangement and value of the combinations pro- 
gresses rather uniformly from the least difficult to the most 
difficult science, confirming the order of the sciences as de- 
termined by other data—e. g., Physiology, Physiography, 
Biology, Physics, Chemistry. 
It is interesting to note that although in the fifth grade, 
Chemistry, the hardest subject, correlates fairly high with 
Physiology, the easiest subject, but in the higher grades 
(7th and 8th) the correlations are much lower. Fifth- 
grade children find any science difficult; but as they pro- 
gress into higher grades, the assimilability of Physiology 
increases so much more rapidly than that of Chemistry 
that an increasing dissimilarity is noticeable in the ranks 
of the combinations. In all grades, however, the correla- 
tions between Chemistry and Physics, two difficult subjects, 
and Physiology and Physiography, two sciences of easy as- 
similability, remains high.

CHAPTER XIV. 
THE UNDERLYING TYPE FOR THE RANKS OF THE 
COMBINATIONS. 
WITH these exceedingly high correlations between the re- 
sponses of ‘children to the test questions in different grades 
and sciences, with the apparently complete elimination of 
the laws of probability in favor of some underlying funda- 
mental arrangement of the combinations, the question 
arises: What is this fundamental arrangement? The chil- 
dren have reacted decidedly in a certain direction; what 
is that direction? 
Of the twenty-seven combinations of A, B, and C marks 
in groups of three, AAA is admittedly the best, CCC the 
poorest, and BBB the exact intermediate achievement. But, 
depending on the point of view, either of three combinations 
may be considered second best— 
BAA, ABA, AAB; 
and either of six combinations third— 
CAA, ACA, AAC, ABB, BBA, BAB, 
etc., ranked as to the actual quality of the combination of 
marks. 
Either of the three phases of the child’s reaction—i. e., 
previous knowledge, power of direct assimilation, and 
power of application—may be considered as of primary 
importance in determining the quality of the combination. 
One or the other will necessarily be of secondary impor- 
tance, and of tertiary importance, respectively. In other 
words, if we were to rank these twenty-seven combinations 
in exact order as better or poorer marks, we would have to 
decide which of the three phases we would consider as of 
primary importance, having all its A’s grouped in the first 
division of nine ranks, its B’s and C’s in the second and 
third divisions of nine ranks; which of the two remaining 
phases, being of secondary importance, would have its A’s 
grouped in the upper third, its B’s in the middle third, and 
its C’s in the lower third of each nine-rank division; and 
which phase would then be left of tertiary importance to 
distribute its A’s, B’s, and C’s successively over all the 
twenty-seven ranks. 
If these phases—(1) previous knowledge, (2) direct as- 
similation, (3) power of application—are arranged in all 
possible combinations as to relative importance, six differ-

The combinations would rank under each group as fol- 
lows:

The rankings of each group furnish a basis for different, 
but not necessarily entirely conflicting, interpretations as 
to the purposes and methods of science instruction to chil- 
dren and the type of results which would be expected from 
the teaching. For example, the combinations under Group 
I. are arranged on the assumption that the best students 
are those whose previous knowledge is the greatest; and 
they would first be roughly grouped as good, indifferent, 
and bad on this basis. Each of these three groups would 
then be subdivided according to the relative powers in di- 
rect assimilation, and within these secondary groups abil- 
ity in application of the principles assimilated would fix 
the final exact arrangement. In other words, if the best 
students in a class are to be selected—students to whom a 
science could be most readily taught—a teacher would first 
choose those who had a previous knowledge of the science, 
saying: ‘Learning proceeds from the known to the un- 
known.” From this group she would select those who could 
most readily assimilate the direct statements of the science, 
saying: “Learning must come before use.” Finally, she 
would pick out those who could best apply their knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-101
  The Underlying Type 101 
Leaving out the attribute of quality and substituting that 
of number, if the arrangement of Group I. was characteris- 
tic of the order in which the reaction of children could be 
ranked from largest to smallest groups, then it would be 
inferred that more children possessed an adequate previous 
knowledge of a typical science than did not; that a some- 
what smaller number of children were able to use this 
knowledge in a successful understanding or assimilation of 
the new direct statements of the science presented to them; 
that the least characteristic ability in children, the develop- 
ment of which would cost the teacher the most labor and 
give the least reward, would be the power of application of 
the principles of the science. 
To another teacher the interpretations of Group VI. 
might appeal, as she considered the power to apply knowl- 
edge the most desirable quality among her pupils. She 
would select her best upon this basis, saying: ‘Knowledge 
you can’t use is worse than none.” She would then choose 
those who had the best assimilative power in order to ac- 
quire the knowledge to apply, and would consider previous 
knowledge as the least harmful deficiency, saying: “He 
that knows not, and knows that he knows not, is ignorant; 
teach him.” : 
Substituting number for quality, the statement would be 
made from the arrangement of Group VI. that the most 
noticeable characteristic of children is their ability to ap- 
ply the facts of science which they have learned, and to rea- 
son further along the lines which have been directly sug- 
gested to them. Their next most obvious ability is in the 
power of directly assimilating information, but that few of 
them possess any store of previous knowledge upon which 
to build—this being of minor importance, however, as the 
deficiency is to be supplied. 
These interpretations of the arrangement of Groups I. 
and VI. are illustrative only. It is obvious. that similar 
processes of reasoning may be applied to each of the other 
groups. Indeed, from each one a most plausible argument 
may be derived as to certain ideals to be the basic princi- 
ples of the method of science teaching to children of the 
grades. Interpreting an imaginary condition where the 
greater numbers of the children possessed abilities as indi- 
cated in the combinations of the upper ranks, more than one 
incongruous situation is postulated. It would be interest- 
' ing to be able to judge many of the educational theories of 
this present moment in the light of the situation which 
would exist if their ideals could be suddenly accomplished. 
In order to ascertain which of these six groups most 
nearly represent the actual performance of the 9,819 chil- 
dren of the last three grammar grades who answered the
-P-A-G-E-102
    
102 Science for the Grades 
tests, a correlation between the ranks of the twenty-seven 
combinations in each grade (Table XVIII.) and in each 
science (Table XVIII.) and the rank order of the combina- 
tions in each of the six groups was computed. Since only 
ranks, and not quantities, are involved in these six ideal 
groups, Pearson’s formula does not apply, but the Rank 
Order Correlation according to Spearman must be used. 
6S(d*) 
n(n’—1) 
in which d = the difference in the rank of a combination in 
the two distributions and n the number of ranks.! 
The rank of the combinations under the six groups are 
the theoretical ideals based upon six different points of 
view. The ranks of the combinations as determined by the 
response of the children, nearly ten thousand of them, is 
the only one that actually exists. Correlation will show 
which of the six ideals is most nearly approached by the 
actual distribution of ranks, and, therefore, which point 
of view is most rational in the training of children of the 
grades in science. It might be confidently expected that 
this point of view would vary in the different grades and 
sciences, according to the age and abilities of the children 
and the diversity of subject-matter. If, however, the cor- 
relations for all six grades and five sciences should agree 
under one single group of ranked combinations, it would be 
obvious that the interpretation of this ideal combination 
would represent the strongest underlying principle in the 
reaction of children of each of the last three grammar 
grades to science in general. The data of these correlations 
are recorded in Table XX. This is computed from the formula, r=

  The Underlying Type 103 
One underlying principle influences and determines the 
rank of the combinations in all grades and sciences. Two 
groups of the six stand out with overwhelming prominence. 
Interpretations based on the arrangement of the combina- 
tions under the order of Group IV. are sound; the order of 
Group III. is of but slightly less significance; but conclu- 
sions based on the orders of the other groups cannot be 
reconciled to the actual conditions, since the correlations 
of the actual ranks of the combinations with these ideal 
groups is either haphazard or strongly negative. Interpre- 
tations, of course, will apply to the majority of children; 
there are always groups of individuals both above and be- 
low the average intelligence who prove to be exceptions to 
any pedagogical rule. 
In Group IV. direct assimilation is of primary impor- 
tance, power of application secondary, and previous knowl- 
edge of tertiary rank. The first power to develop in a child 
is that of direct assimilation, and this ability keeps ahead 
in all development. A text in science written for the grades 
must abound in direct statements of fact, plain illustrative 
material, and leave little to be inferred. Successful teach- 
ing of science in the grades must be judged largely by the 
extent to which children master the direct assignments of 
the day. An equivalent success in reasoning from the sim- 
ple facts learned must not be expected. A book which is 
full of the so-called “thought questions” is not altogether 
the best for grade instruction, however applicable that 
method may be to high-school classes. The powers of log- 
ical reasoning have not yet developed in the minds of grade 
children, and abstract principles cannot be visualized by 
them. 
Neither can reliance be placed on any appreciable pre- 
vious knowledge possessed by the children. For the grades, 
science must be even more simple in idea than in language. 
An eighth-grade child is abundantly able to read a fairly 
technical discussion concerning the hardness of water, or 
the magnetic field through a coil of wire; but it is not at all 
certain that he has ever inquired into the reason for the 
use of ammonia or soda in the home, or that he has ever 
taken the cover off an electric bell. 
In fact, the self-acquired knowledge of children goes but 
little beyond the observation of obvious cause and effect. 
The much-proclaimed curiosity of children rarely searches 
out principles. It would seem that the most familiar ob- 
jects would be the best understood, but the tendency to take 
familiar things for granted largely neutralizes the spirit of 
inquiry. This tendency often persists even to adult life.
-P-A-G-E-104
    
104 Science for the Grades 
The writer found, in a study of the previous knowledge of 
several hundred of his Normal and college students, in be- 
ginning Chemistry, that over half of them did not know 
whether air was one substance or a mixture of substances.! 
The question arises: How familiar must a thing be in order 
that the facts about it may be common knowledge? 
The strong positive correlations of Group III., in all cases 
only slightly less than the corresponding correlations for 
Group IV., show that in respect to previous knowledge and 
power of application there are two approximately equal 
types of reactions. The more appropriate interpretation 
(Group IV.) appraises the ability to reason from or to 
apply the knowledge gained by direct assimilation as of 
greater value than the wide experience which would have 
supplied a store of previous knowledge. This experience, 
being a product of environment, is not under the control of 
the child, and he cannot be held responsible for its lack, ex- 
cept to the degree in which close observation would have 
supplied it. Of course, memory functions in the retention 
of these experiences. 
The other interpretation (Group III.) would assign the 
more importance to this experience rather than to the abil- 
ity to apply knowledge. It is obvious that there are two 
large and not very dissimilar groups of children—one with 
better memory than logic, the other with better reasoning 
power than memory. Of course, one ability by no means 
eliminates the other, either in the individual or in the mass; 
but one or the other merely predominates to a ‘greater or 
less degree. 
General Science instruction in the grades, therefore, must 
be studied and planned from two angles—content and 
method. The content should be the most appropriate to 
the child’s environment; but, above all, it should be assim- 
ilable. Real principles of science, it appears, are not as- 
similated by children of the fifth grade and below; Phys- 
iology and Physiography are appropriate in the sixth grade; 
Biology, and possibly Physics, may be successfully taught 
in the seventh grade; Physics can be assimilated in the 
eighth grade; while the laws and phenomena of Chemistry 
seem unsuited to any grade. This order of assimilability 
is radically different from the rank of the sciences in im- 
portance in the eighteen texts, most of them for high-school 
use, in which Physics is given the most adequate treatment, 
and Physiography, Biology, Physiology, and Chemistry 
follow in the order named.

  The Underlying Type 105 
The method of science instruction in the grades should 
make full use of the predominant power of the child to ‘di- 
rectly assimilate facts—an ability well illustrated by the 
well-known ease with which they master the language. Ef- 
forts to cause powers of reason and observation to function 
when by the laws of child psychology these powers are in a 
rudimentary stage of development will result in waste of 
energy on the part of both teacher and child. 
As the use of General Science spreads to the grades, it is 
hoped that both content and method will be built upon a 
firm foundation of educational principles determined by ex- 
periment. As in the great manufacturing industries of our 
country, the experimenting should be done in the laboratory, 
not in the factory. Tests on small, but adequate, groups 
of children should be relied upon more and more to deter- 
mine the wisdom of our methods, with all the accuracy of 
the analytical chemist brought to bear on the problem. 
With the nation awake to the great waste of effort which 
some of our educational practices permit, and with an ap- 
preciation of the delicacy of the precious material which 
our teachers attempt to mold and fashion into the finished 
product as good citizens, each able to make a living and 
appreciate the necessary refinements of culture, a truly sci- 
entific spirit is demanded in education. The standard test, 
the survey, and other types of quantitative educational 
analysis, have of necessity been evolved. There never was a 
time when dogmatic statements based on mere opinion were 
less appropriate. It is hoped that this study has contrib- 
uted in some degree to the sum of experimental knowledge 
in education. 
I wish to acknowledge my sincere indebtedness to Prof. 
John J. Didcoct, Professor of Secondary Education, George 
Peabody College for Teachers, for helpful advice in plan- 
ning this study and his kindly criticisms of the interpreta- 
tions from the data obtained. I also have been encouraged 
by the attitude of Prof. Shelton J. Phelps, Professor of 
School Administration, George Peabody College for Teach- 
ers, who has examined especially the statistical methods 
used. To other instructors in the institution, and especially 
to the gentlemen of the Seminar, I am grateful for sugges- 
tions, comments, criticisms, and encouragement.

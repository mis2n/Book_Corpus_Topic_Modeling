Preface 
The present essay on the psychology of 
attention and interest is an attempt to clarify and 
arrange the many facts that have been brought 
_ to light by numerous experiments in the psycho- 
logical laboratories. I have felt myself bound, 
not to uphold any special theory or school, but to 
present the facts as they seem to be. The 
exposition of the subject under the categories, 
‘description,’ ‘illustration,’ ‘development,’ ‘ex- 
planation,’ and ‘definition,’ is in line with the 
more modern and scientific presentation as seen 
in books on physiology, embryology, zodlogy, 
medicine, etc. Some may differ with me as re- 
gards the exact demarcation of the different 
aspects of the subject. The facts, however, are 
not changed because of any scheme of presenta- 
tion. My chief obligations are to J. M. Baldwin, 
J. McKeen Cattell, E. L. Thorndike, E. B. 
Tichener, F. J. E. Woodbridge, and other ex- 
ponents of the scientific attitude towards facts 
and the presentation of facts.

THE GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 
g1. DESCRIPTION 
1. Tue Suzsect-opsect Reiation. In a 
loose and popular manner, the object, as differ- 
ent from the subject is readily recognised. The 
man who picks up a book to read, the woman who 
selects goods for a dress, the child who plays with 
the toy, each, in a vague way, distinguishes an 
object which exists apart from the self. There 
may be present no intensive analysis of the 
nature of such existence, or of the meaning of 
the relationship, but for the practical purposes of 
usage and experience, the object, as existing 
apart from the subject, has a more or less utili- 
tarian or esthetic value. In scientific research 
and laboratory experimentation a more rigid in- 
terpretation of ‘object’ is made. Close analysis 
is necessary sharply to define exactly what is 
‘subject’ and what ‘object’ in a given situation, 
and every effort is made to eliminate the personal 
equation, emotional bias, illusion, or other per-

sonal factors. The astronomer limits his field to 
a portion of the heavens, the botanist busies him- 
self with a bud, a seed, a root fibre, the geologist 
restricts his activity during a given investigation 
to some strata, rock formation, or what not, and 
so with investigators in other lines. Some situa- 
tion is selected and treated as an object apart 
from the self. Many situations in the course of 
an investigation are so considered and made the 
object of close study. 
The psychologist differs in nowise from other 
scientific investigators. In his work he deals 
with specific situations, and examines, interprets, 
analyses, and reasons much like scientists in other 
fields. His point of attack may be different, his 
interpretation may deal with qualitative or with 
- quantitative aspects differing from those se- 
lected by a botanist or a physicist, but his basis is 
much like theirs. If his work is to have any 
value, it must be based on situations which have 
a concrete filling of some kind, on objects which 
are more or less definite, on situations which, 
while they are under investigation, must be con- 
sidered apart from the self which is concerned 
with the experimentation. The scientific point 
of view is one whichis recognised by the psycholo- 
gist, but which is seldom held by cultured work- 
 
-P-A-G-E-11

ers in other fields. The mind is usually considered 
by such as an ethereal will-o’-the-wisp, a spirit 
which appears, now here, now there, and which 
is so evanescent that one can speculate about it 
with safety, draw deductive conclusions, and 
construct hypotheses which can not be tested in 
concrete situations. That popular opinion is 
wrong in this connection will be readily under- 
stood by one who has seen the laboratory study 
of mental processes. Not the mind, but some 
situation is studied with special reference to con- 
sciousness. A given field is made the center of 
attention, tested according to some definite 
method, and studied in an inductive manner. ° 
In general, the subject-object relation is one, 
which, from long habit, is accepted as a matter of 
course in most fields. This dual relationship fits 
in with the nature of things, stands the test of 
experience, of application, of work, and is be- 
lieved in, regardless of metaphysical or other 
disquisitions to the contrary. From this point 
of view all else stands opposed to the self. Self 
and the rest of the universe constitute the whole. 
No doubt the rest of the universe exists for the 
self as an ‘other’ of related parts, as a whole 
which is affected by every act of the individual. 
In actual practice so extended an ‘other’ is nar-

rowed down to some definite situation which can 
be manipulated and controlled. In a piece of 
work, a laboratory experiment, for example, the 
individual is not immediately concerned with the 
rest of the universe. He may affect it, his actions 
may result in a redistribution of relationships, 
but this is no direct concern of his. He is usually 
concerned with only what is under his immediate 
control. The rest of the universe is not so much 
‘object,’ as ‘objective’ to him. The object is 
rather the point of junction between the indi- 
vidual and the rest of the system, between himself 
and all that is ‘objective.’ Some limited portion 
constitutes for the time the point of junction be- 
tween the individual and what is objective. The 
individual localises his efforts and restricts the 
extent of his control. 
2. Tue Port or Junction. ‘Point of junc- 
tion’ corresponds loosely to what is called ‘object,’ 
as, for example, the material in an experiment, a 
place of business, a reading room in a library, a 
tool, or what not. Different kinds of such ob- 
jects, however, may be distinguished. 
(a) Real. As one looks before one and con- 
siders what one sees, the object in such a case is 
visual and somewhat extended. If touch and 
motor control enter in the determination of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
Ca emcees aa 
GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 7 
object, the field at once becomes extremely nar- 
rowed. If other senses are involved, the field 
receives a richer content and means more to the 
individual who is in control. The quality and 
the extent of the point of junction thus depend 
upon the senses which are involved in the experi- 
ences. Any sense may mediate a point of junc- 
tion. We may have a visual field, an auditory or 
a tactile field. So, too, a situation may be deter- 
mined by all together. Usually seyeral of the 
senses are called into play. An object is seized, 
tested, taken apart, put under the microscope, 
and controlled in as many ways as possible. 
What is before one at any moment, what exists 
as a single pulse of apprehension, therefore, can 
not always be said to constitute a situation given 
in full. To be given in toto, to have the feel of 
reality, a situation must allow of reactive adjust- 
ment, must be under some kind of motor control. 
Only as one is before a situation which can be 
manipulated and reconstructed in a practical 
way, only as one can test the visual field by active 
selection and adjustment, can it be considered 
as basic and real. An essential aspect of a basic 
situation is this impelling and necessary character 
which it receives through touch and motor con- 
trol. It may be denied metaphysically, it may 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
8 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
be doubted philosophically, but practically, 
doubt or denial means destruction. For ex- 
ample, tentative denial of a stone wall may result 
in a bruise or other injury. Scholastic disbelief 
must be swept aside when actual contact is 
effected. Contrariwise, belief is never so strong 
as when motor control reinforces visual appre- 
hension. 
The more direct and immediate control is pos- 
sible when the situation is beneath one’s feet or 
under one’s hands. The various junctions, 
visual, auditory, tactile, etc., can then be bound. 
together by the motor. Such a limited field is 
further widened by means which will facilitate 
motor contact. The microscope enlarges the 
visual field without bringing it outside of direct 
motor control, the railroad and the telegraph 
enable one to make as many points of contact as 
possible within a given time, touch and motor 
control are aided by delicate instruments, machin- 
ery does work which the hands can not do, and 
so on. Where no means exist for the realisation 
of motor control, a situation must remain incom- 
plete, may, in fact, be considered a chimera. The 
pot of gold at the other end of the rainbow, for 
example, has still to be felt as a reality. 
(b) Ideal. In an ideal, schematic, and repre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 9 
sentative sort of way a situation may assume a 
form somewhat removed from the original. An 
outline, plan, picture, word, image, idea, thought, 
may take the place of the situation for the indi- 
vidual, may, in a number of ways, stand for the 
actual situation. One who wishes to buy a book, 
for example, needs but to utter the necessary 
words in order to realise his intention. ‘Book’ in 
such a case is all that is necessary for the purpose. 
If it is to be read, however, it must exist in more 
real form. 
When a situation is present in ideal form it 
receives the stamp of reality when it points to 
some foundation situation which can be directly 
controlled in a motor way. It receives a tinge 
of the impelling and necessary nature of founda- 
tion situations only by the feel of motor tenden- 
cies which impel realisation. A book which, when 
thought of, calls forth tendencies to open and 
touch it, is much more real than simply ‘book’ 
spelled out or seen only visually. So, too, the 
idea of a plaything has reality for the child when 
he feels tendencies to play with it. An ideal 
scheme can have reality only as affecting prac- 
tice, only as it leads to some basic situation. 
‘Until such realisation is possible it must be 
incomplete, it must exist much like a visual situ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
10 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
ation which lies outside the field of direct motor 
control. 
Even as partial, as schematic and formal, ideas 
and images assume for the time a form deter- 
mined in part by foundation situations. As a 
formal object, the thought exists in the shape of 
a word, diagram, outline, or expression. The 
formal aspect of thought and ideation receives 
its stability by the same means which give sta- 
bility to basic situations. Motor control is called 
into service for the purpose of fixing the formal 
elements of ideal situations. Speech, writing, 
drawing, illustration, construction, etc., give to 
images and ideas a form which enables them to 
receive further verification in application and 
practice. In ideal situations we can not readily 
escape motor control. Images which are so flit- 
ting and transitory as to be outside the bounds of 
motor control and definite realisation of some 
sort, practical or esthetic, must stand outside the 
pale of belief. As ideal situations they can have 
little value. 
(c) Possible. Ideal situations which have 
arisen out of immediate experience and direct 
control naturally have the feel of reality to a 
greater degree than ideas or images which have 
been acquired in a more indirect way. If, for 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 11 
example, one has seen snow, felt it, and handled 
it, one will have a greater belief in its existence, 
will read a reality into the word ‘snow’ more 
readily than the savage who has simply heard of 
it. Much of what is given in instruction, in 
reading, in conversation, etc., has a reality only 
in an indirect manner. Upon the basis of what- 
ever experience has been acquired, a number of 
ideal situations acquire a reality in terms of transferred control. One may not have seen an emu, but if one is told that it is a bird similar to 
the ostrich, one more readily gives the term a reality which can be tested in some immediate, 
concrete situation. So, too, one may never have 
been in China, but actual situations before one, 
ideal situations in the form of pictures, descrip- 
tions, and the like, give one a basis which may be 
transferred to the possible situation implied 
in the term ‘China.’ The situation is possible in that there is a certain belief in its existence, in 
possible control and reaction in a sensorimotor 
manner. One feels sure, for example, that China exists, that travel to it is possible, that certain 
reactions may take place in it, that control in it is much like that under present conditions. 
The possible, it is seen, is a form of the ideal, 
but it is a form in which transferred motor coeffi-

cients are called into service to give backing to 
belief in what is considered possible. Often 
one will believe in the reality of a possible situ- 
ation which to others is just as surely a chimera. 
The broader and deeper the foundation of ex- 
perience, the stronger will be the belief in situa- 
tions which, to the untrained mind, seem to have 
no reality. The situation, for example, which was 
a possible one for Columbus and the early navi- 
gators, did not excite the same belief in the 
people about him. It became, to some extent, a 
real situation, when actual control was realised.

ing. It will take about ten times as much ether to pro- 
duce the same effect. Chloroform is ten times more 
potent a drug than ether."

g Ill. DEVELOPMENT 
1. Sraces. It is highly probable, that the 
newly-born child is not conscious of subject or 
object in the same manner as is the grown adult. 
One is so accustomed to look upon an object as 
having some kind of existence apart from the 
subject that one tends to overlook the fact that 
this twofold relationship is the result of consid- 
erable development, the end station, as it were, 
of a somewhat complicated series of movements 
on the part of the child. Even in the developed 
consciousness, it is somewhat difficult sharply to 
differentiate what is subject, and what is object. 
In philosophy, for example, one aspect is often 
taken as basic, and the attempt is made to ex- 
plain the other in terms of it. In psychology, 
too, one or the other aspect is unduly emphasised. 
‘As far as attention is concerned, from the ob jec- 
tive side, it is viewed as simply a state of clearness 
and distinctness. From the subjective side, it 
is sometimes considered as ideal reinforcement 
or arrest of incoming impressions, or, by the older 
writers, as a species of mental activity. 
It must be remembered, in the first place, that 
subject and object, though looked upon, in a 
developed state, as two distinct things, have ex- 
istence only in a dynamic relationship, and, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 17 
the second place, that each in itself is an abstrac- 
tion. We do not have the subject, as such, and 
apart from some connection with an object. So, 
too, an object, by itself, means nothing, as far 
as the conscious subject is concerned. An object 
is an object, only as it affects a subject, only as 
there is action and reaction of some sort between 
the two. In a state of attention, for example, 
the subject attends to some situation, and some 
situation is in the focus of attention. We speak 
of each in a logical manner as having a separate 
existence, but such discussion does not affect the 
situation as it actually exists. Continual treat- 
ment of these two phases, subjective and objec- 
tive, as isolated units, leads one to look upon 
them as units which exist in independence of each 
other. In any conscious moment, however, the 
two will be found together. 
In the first pulse of life there is probably 
neither self nor object as a distinct phase of a 
situation. There is probably in the newly-born 
consciousness an undifferentiated whole, in which 
neither subject nor object stands out as a distinct 
existential fact. The nearest state in the adult 
consciousness is the dreamy condition usually 
present just before one goes to sleep, or when 
one is half asleep, and half awake. Out of this 2

raw material are developed notions of self and 
object. In early childhood self and object are 
often confused, and the gross division between 
the two is the result of considerable development. 
When the object is looked upon as more or less 
distinct from the self, attention, though existing 
from the very beginning, can be considered as a 
separate, conscious process. The three stages 
may be illustrated by the following diagrams, 
each of which represents a phase of a compli- 
cated process which at times combines the other 
phases: 
A Cc 
Fig. II. A, subject and object not differentiated. B, subject (S) and 
object (0). ©, object in the focus of attention. 
2. Process. The process by which the notions 
- of ‘self’ and ‘object’ are constructed is essentially 
a motor one. As soon as more or less definite 
motor reactions and movements begin, as in 
seizing and grasping, some portions of the field 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
GIVEN SITUATION IN ATTENTION 19 
of consciousness become outlined, cut out of their 
setting, and woven into the personal history of 
the individual concerned. A child which seizes 
a pencil, for example, plucks it out of its setting, 
gives it outline, uses it perhaps, and places it as 
a separate object among other objects. While 
the pencil may have had a more or less distinct 
visual outline, its control by the child would give 
greater vividness and strength to impressions of 
its separate existence. In fact, for grown people, 
manipulation and motor control is a test of the 
individual existence of an object. If one is not 
certain, for example, whether an object is fas- 
tened to some other, is part of it, or one separate 
from it, one will take it in hand, lift it, and try 
it in a number of ways. 
The changing nature of the objective field, 
too, tends to give it the stamp of existence apart 
from the self. A portion of the field comes and 
goes, suffers reconstruction or even destruction, 
and seems a flux opposed to a more or less stable 
background of individual feeling and conscious- 
ness. It is the same mass of feeling, for instance, 
which accompanies the act of throwing a toy out 
of the window, as that which goes with the activ- 
ity of looking out of the window, or of going 
down stairs to look for the toy. Feelings of 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
20 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
motor activity, of satisfaction, pain, etc:, are re-: 
ferred to the self in a more or less conscious 
manner. These give the self a value as a more 
or less unchanging, existential fact. In addition, 
visual elements, as of form of the body, remain 
much the same, and reinforce the feelings of 
motor activity, satisfaction, ease, quiescence, 
pleasure, and the like.® 
An aid in this process of differentiation is 
such control of others as enters into the child’s* 
field of experience. Conflict of control will 
bring out the ‘other’ as a separate factor in the 
total field. The difference in the conduct of 
others when entering in the same field of objects 
controlled by the child will also tend to stamp 
the ‘other’ as an existential fact apart from ob- 
jects within the child’s field of activity. A grown 
person, for example, will take an object from 
the child, will take the child from the object,

will assist the child in the control of the object. 
Such conflict of control, even with adults, em- 
phasises the existence of another as a separate 
fact which is to be reckoned with in the manipula- 
tion of objects. 
Within the objective field many changes may 
take place because of the manipulation and con- 
trol attempted by the child. Development of the 
situation may proceed by increase in the number 
and kinds of the points of contact which are 
made. When a child sees an object, he usually 
tries to seize it, bite it, throw it about, take it 
apart, test it in every possible manner. Each 
point of junction is a new experience for the 
child and gives fuller meaning to the situation in 
hand. Development of a situation is also pos- 
sible through reconstruction or partial destruc- 
tion. To a beholder the activity of the child may 
not mean development, may, in fact, seem a 
waste of time, or a positive nuisance. But to 
the child such control as he exercises, whether de- 
structive or not, results in a widening of his own 
experiences, and in instructive changes in the 
field before him. 
Successive acts of control result in increased 
differentiation and development. Residual ef- 
fects accumulate both in the subject and in the

objective field. In the individual such cumula- 
tive results are represented by habits, mental 
dispositions, memories, and the like. The child, 
in popular parlance, ‘will know better next time.’ 
In the objective field we have, in the more ad- 
vanced stages, material progress, tradition, moral 
law and order, custom, ete. The latter then re- 
acts on the former and tends to preserve control 
' within the grooves of custom. The social back- 
ground is usually able to enforce its conventions 
and manners on the individual, who, in turn, may 
be able to effect changes in such conventions and 
traditions. Action and reaction go together, here 
as elsewhere. On the basis of cumulative residua, 
the individual is able ‘to rise on his dead self 
to higher things.’ Whatever he has accomplished 
can be used as a foundation for further control. 
The child, for example, who has mastered writ- 
ing and reading, is able to spend his energy on 
other things. Below is a schematic outline which 
illustrates progress and individual endeavour on 
a broad platform of habit. 
Development of a situation in the manner sug- 
gested above demands a narrowing of the field 
under manipulation, a fixation of the object, a 
closer and more refined series of adjustments, a 
more delicate interpretation, a finer feel or body

attitude, in short, attention. The subject must 
select his object, examine aspects of it, try it 
in various ways, and control it in a more or less 
definite manner. Self and object exist together, 
each is influential in producing changes, each 
must be considered in relation to the other. The 
objective side of the situation gives us the field 
of attention. The subjective side gives us those 
motor adjustments, ideal elements, and reinfore- 
ing factors which are usually present in the more 
advanced stages of attention. Both aspects, the 
subjective and the ob jective, must be considered 
in the treatment of attention.

found in the subject-object relation, and in at- 
tention. Some restriction of the objective field 
is necessary for the continued existence of the 
organism. Discrimination and selection are nec- 
essary even in animal life, and in the more ele- 
mentary functions of eating and drinking. The 
savage who misses his aim may have to go hungry 
or starve. The hunter who can not find signs 
of water may perish. The child who is unable 
to control his knife will cut himself. The adult 
who does not hear the horn of the electric car 
may lose his life. Focalisation and definite reac- 
tion are necessary to ensure a modicum of ease 
and satisfaction. Strange and uncommon situa- 
tions which may result in pain or death must 
be focalised before further reaction of definite 
nature is possible. Moreover, focalisation with 
selection may be needed to ensure safe control. 
Where a situation is more or less known, fur- 
ther knowledge is possible only by analysis, dis- 
crimination, selection, and restricted control. 
Scientific workers are continually constructing 
mechanical aids by means of which given situa- 
tions can be cut up into smaller parts, restricted 
within a limited field, and intensively controlled. 
Specialisation is but another name for such fo- 
calisation and concentration.

CHAPTER II 
THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT OF ATTENTION 
g§ I. DESCRIPTION 
1. CLEARNEsSs AND Distinctyess. A striking 
characteristic of the field of attention is the 
change in the clearness and distinctness which re- 
sults from the motor and ideal processes which 
are aroused. As control of a situation becomes 
restricted, as the field narrows and becomes cut 
out of its setting, it is said to become distinct. 
The situation is distinct in that it is more or less 
sharply defined, in that it stands out from its 
surroundings. The outline of a flying bird as 
seen against a clear sky, the blur on the horizon 
which is recognised as a ship, these are distinct, 
though they can not be said to be clear. When, 
in addition, the parts of the situation stand out 
within the whole, when the relations between the 
parts become evident, the situation is said to be 
clear. The flying bird is then seen to have cer- 
tain coloration, the ship is then recognised as a 
steamship, with two or more stacks, and so on. 
Distinctness refers to the totality as set off 
against a marginal background. Clearness re-

fers to a further differentiation of the parts 
within the whole. 
Clearness and distinctness are terms which ‘ 
have historical connections. Descartes used clear- 
ness and distinctness as signs by which to judge 
of the truth of notions. 
I call that clear which is present and manifest to an 
attentive mind; .. . and distinct, that which is so sep- 
arate and distinguished from every thing else that it con- 
tains within itself only that which is clear.* 
_ Clearness and distinctness have also been em- 
emphasized in connection with visual metaphors. 
The ‘Blickpunkt view of attention has been 
prominently brought forward by Wundt and 
Titchener, but it was used long before them. 
Fortlage likens attention to the ‘clear glance of 
observation” and Lotze compares it to the ‘ret- 
ina of the eye.” Hamilton writes in a similar 
strain. 
Consciousness may be compared to a, telescope, atten- 
tion to the pulling out or in of the tubes in accommodat- 
ing the focus to the object; and we might, with equal 
justice, distinguish in the eye, the adjustment of the 
pupil from the general organ of vision, as, in the mind,

distinguish attention from consciousness as separate 
faculties.* 
This predominance of visual terminology is not 
strange when we consider, as Jevons points out, 
that at least 246 words in the English language 
have been derived from the root ‘spec. 
A third characteristic of the field of attention, 
emphasised by some, denied by others, is inten- 
sity, or rather, increase in intensity. Con- 
siderable discussion of the hair-splitting va- 
riety may be found defending one or the other 
view.° Any contentions one way or the other in 
this connection disregard the basic function of 
such changes in the situation as take place. These 
changes are secondary and subordinate to the 
motor control and manipulation which is to be

effected, There is no inherent virtue in either 
increase or decrease in intensity. Such a change, 
in itself, means little. It is the purpose which 
the change is to subserve which determines 
whether or not there is to be an increase in the 
intensity of incoming impressions. If increase 
of intensity will facilitate more perfect control, 
then the individual will secure such increase in 
intensity and illumination, by artificial means, if 
necessary. Usually, ideal and motor reinforce- 
ments are called into service to secure increase 
in the intensity of an impression. If one listens 
closely enough, one may hear a sound which has 
no real existence. If ideal elements can not be 
used, mechanical instruments are called into play. 
On the other hand, if a more modified atmosphere 
is necessary, a situation may be plucked out of a 
too intense and blinding illumination, and placed 
in one more subdued. An artist will examine a 
picture with half-closed eyes. One may, in fact, 
close one’s eyes entirely to a too obtrusive situa- 
tion. Intensity may or may not be found ac- 
cording as control calls for it or not. Increase 
in intensity, when present, is possible only within 
narrow limits. One can, for example, follow a 
diminuendo with increasing attention. The re- 
sulting increase in intensity is only a relative one,

and does not of necessity force the notes to their 
maximal strength. The diminuendo will remain 
a diminuendo, but with a less steep descent. 
2. Persistence. In attention, the situation be- 
comes more or less distinct and clear. In addition, 
it may persist for a time in the focus of the given 
field. Such persistence depends in great measure 
upon the points of contact which can be made, 
and upon the ideal elements which can be excited. 
When an object allows of esthetic interpretation, 
motor control, etc., the probabilities are that it 
will hold attention longer than will a more barren 
object. So too, a field which revives numerous 
ideas and images, will stay in the focus for a 
considerable time. One who gazes long at a 
time-table does not do so solely because of any 
inherent interest in the printed matter before 
him. 
The three characteristics, clearness, distinct- 
ness, and persistence, inhere in the objective field, 
in the situation under control. The tendency to 
treat consciousness as a special kind of activity 
has led some to speak of the clearness and dis- 
tinctness of the mental state, of consciousness 
in general. Without a content, however, a mental 
state has no meaning. In attention to an object,

weak the distinct period is longer than when the 
impression is stronger.

periods of greatest distinctness are usually longer 
in the morning than at evening.

ations of attention. Thus 10 g. of alcohol 
decrease the length of the periods of fluctuation 
and induce a general fatigue, while 3 g. of brom.

pathological conditions of depression or of ex- 
citation respectively decrease or increase effi- 
ciency in this connection.”

Fluctuation in the case of minimal visual im- 
pressions seems to be well established. In the 
case of minimal auditory and tactile impressions, 
however, it is highly probable that any fluctua- 
tion similar to visual fluctuation does not take 
place. It is extremely difficult to establish any 
definite waves of distinctness and indistinctness 
in such cases. One should go through a series of 
tests before accepting a few results of somewhat 
doubtful experimentation. If sound is used, the 
stimulation must be minimal and persistent as 
far as the mechanical arrangements are con- 
cerned. Simple tones seem to remain constant, 
and very light weights (cork) on the hand give 
no evidence of fluctuation. This can be tried by 
any one.°

4. Unrry. Before one discusses the unity of 
attention one should state exactly what one re- 
fers to by such unity and also what conditions 
hold when such unity is tested. For example, it 
is true that one can recognise a 
    word as easily as 
one can a letter. The unity is then the word as 
a whole and not the separate letters which com- 
pose the word. So, too, one can glance at a page 
and give the number of words on the page as two 
or three hundred. What is then i in the focus of 
attention is the single page which means or sig- 
nifies the number of words. It would hardly 
hold, however, that three hundred words, as sepa- 
rate words, were seen in the oni act of apprehen- 
sion. It is usually held that fe the visual field 
attention to four or five dist and separate 
objects is possible.'° If these objects are really 
seen as separate objects, then the statement is 
true, that attention is possible to five objects. But 
if through long association and habitual motor 
adjustments, certain groupings have come to 
mean ‘five,’ if contact and m anipulation of ob- 
jects have shown such objects to be five, and to 
stand for ‘five,’ then the single act of attention 
to groupings of four or five would result in the 
recall of ‘five’ as a number whole associated with   
See, for example, Pillsbury, W- | Attention, Ch. VI.
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 35 
the group. In such a case, even though ‘five’ 
means a series, a number of successive acts of 
counting, a succession of distinct and separate 
events, the act of attention at the given moment 
did not necessarily include such counts or series. 
We look, for example, at a series of lines and 
cognise five at a given moment. Now do we 
actually see five distinct and separate objects at 
a glance, or do we recognise a group which ex- 
perience has taught us is ‘five,’ and then interpret 
the ‘five’ another way, i.e., as a series? 
Two varying conditions lead one to believe 
that the latter is the case. When the length of 
time in which a group is exposed to an observer 
is shortened, fewer objects are seen in a single 
act of attention. So, too, the results differ when 
the ages of the observers differ. Griffing tested 
the pupils of the different school years with a 
series of letters. The observers looked at the 
fixation point, and at the signal, ‘Ready,’ the 
letters were shown for a given time. In the fol- 
lowing tables are given the results of two series 
of tests, the first with a time limit of 1 second, 
the second with a time limit of .1 second? A 
study of the figures will show the variation due 
to decrease in the time of exposure.

THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 37 
It is seen that when the time of exposure was 
reduced from one second to one tenth of a second, 
the number of letters seen in a single act of at- 
tention dropped considerably, in most cases to 
less than half as many. It is also seen that the 
younger pupils were able to grasp a much smaller 
number of letters in a single act of apprehension 
than were the older ones. One can not say, 
therefore, that attention to five objects is pos- 
sible, if one means five separate and distinct 
objects. All the pupils were shown the same 
letters, but such letters did not signify the same 
number wholes to the different pupils. As a 
simple, mechanical act, the seeing and the atten- 
tion were the same in each.case. The difference 
in the results was due to the difference in the 
development and training of the pupils, to the 
difference in the associations, and in the experi- 
ence with numbered or grouped objects. 
A series of experiments by Hylan show prac- 
tically the same thing, namely, that the elements 
of time and experience are conditioning factors 
in the apprehension of groups of objects. In 
these tests six letters on each of twenty cards were 
exposed in succession, one letter at a time. The 
series of six letters was exposed for 20 . or 8.6. 
for each letter. In the first tests, the shutter

left to right. A signal was given before the 
exposure of the series. Each of the twenty cards 
was shown five times, this making one hundred 
exposures for each subject. The subjects gave 
both the letters seen, and their order. The results 
in the following table give the totals for the

  The first effect of the letters was that of a single com- 
plex impression, some characters appearing distinctly 
outlined, some confused, and some entirely unseen. This 
conscious impression followed the exposure in much the 
same way that a positive after image follows a stimula- 
tion of light. It was sometimes possible to hold this 
impression with all its details an appreciable length of 
time without recognising a single letter, until each char-   : ai08 . 
acter was recognised one at a time. But it was more

   frequent that one or sometimes two letters were recog- 
nised without being preceded by an appreciable interval, 
and these followed by one or two more, one at a time and 
in distinct succession.** 
Hylan conducted a further series of experi- 
ments to test the distribution of attention and to 
find whether or not the groups are seen as groups 
of distinct objects, or as groups which are later 
analysed into their separate parts. Lines, nu- 
merals, letters, and words were shown on cards. 
Twelve cards were used five times each in each 
series. The smallest number of lines on a card 
was 4 (2 mm. apart), of numerals and letters, 
8, and of words, 2. The observer was asked to 
give the arrangement of the single elements of 
an impression. The results in the following ta- 
ble are the totals of sixty tests. The per cent is 
that of the number of wrong cases seen. The 
time exposure was one tenth of a second.

ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
It is seen that attention is not evenly distributed 
over the given field, that it does not grasp a 
totality as a group of distinct objects, that, in 
fact, the number, five, six, tell is due, either to 
an association of the group with the number, or 
an interpretation of the group, an analysis which 
has no place in the original act of attention. 
One can not, therefore, say that visual attention 
to five or six objects is possible. It is highly 
probable that attention to more than one or two 
distinct and separate objects is impossible. In 
fact, in attention to a number of series of three 
letters each, Cron and Kraepelin found that the 
middle letter was read correctly the most, the last 
letter a less, and the first letter the least number 
of times.!* This would hardly be if there were 
such a thing as a single pulse of attention which 
grasped in detail several distinct objects. 
Tests on attention to a succession of sounds 
show that as many as 8 can be apprehended as 
a group, and that when the sounds are so 
grouped, as many as from 2 ty 5 groups can be

succession in such cases seems to vary between 
0.8 and 0.18 seconds.’® As in visual impressions, 
so in auditory, it is highly probable that the 
sounds are not cognised as distinct and separate 
impressions, but rather as a group or rhythm 
which is connected with the number ‘eight,’ or 
which, as a rhythmic impression, comes to mean 
‘eight.’ There still remains to be made a series 
of experiments in which a number of simulta- 
neous auditory impressions are given with vary- 
ing periods of persistence, as in the case of visual 
impressions. 
In the field of touch Krohn gave simultaneous 
touch impressions to different parts of the body. 
He found that when the impressions were scat- 
tered, as many as six or seven could be appre- 
hended as distinct and separate." But as Hylan 
remarks, “It should be said, however, that after- 
images of touch were very persistent, and were 
used to a considerable extent in locating the sen- 
sations.”"7 What has been said in connection

refore be consid- 
In with visual impressions may th 
ered to hold in the case of tou 
visual, auditory, and tactile attention, we may 
safely say that the number of objects to which 
one can attend is not more than one or two. 
Larger numbers must be EonMe as due to 
group associations, or to later analyses which 
interpret the group impression and read into it 
the different objects. 
The different experiments have been made in 
visual, auditory, and tactile fields. Attention in 
the visual field is something different from at- 
tention in the auditory field, and the same is true 
of attention in the tactile sphere. We can not 
be said to possess any distinct and separate power 
of attention. Each field is distinct and separate. 
Just how many fields can be attended to at once, 
depends in part upon the connection of such 
fields with some common situation, in part upon 
the unity of motor control, and sensations. 
  
in part upon the 
experience of the subject. Th 
performed a series of experim

here. From the data thus far presented, however, 
it seems safe to infer that what we have is not a 
single pulse of consciousness, not a uniform field 
of attention, but rather a number of concomitant 
pulses of consciousness, a number of synchro- 
nous situations. In most cases the visual and 
the motor coalesce, but this need not always 
be so. When visual, motor, or other fields coin- 
cide in a single situation, unity is usually pos- 
sible in the field of attention. When such fields, 
however, inhere in different objects, when stimu- 
lation comes through different channels and from 
different objects, partial attention to each may 
be possible, depending upon the complexity of 
the situation and the intensity of the attempted 
control. In short, we have a number of at- 
tentions, and not a single power of attention. 
This, however, is anticipating later discussion. 
5. Faciniration AND ARREST. Under the 
name of ‘distraction of attention’ a number of 
experiments have been made with a view of de- 
termining the effects of extraneous stimulation 
on attention to some given fields. Some of these 
tests showed that at times the results were better 
when the so-called distraction was attempted. 
For example, when music was played on a piano 
while the observer lifted weights and discrimi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  44 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
nated them, the results were better than when there 
was no music.'* Such tests, however, are based on 
the assumption that error alone is the means of 
detecting distraction of attention. These tests, 
too, assume that extraneous stimulation is one of 
the few means of securing distraction. A great 
deal of experimentation in various fields, however, 
has shown that attention may be arrested or facil- 
itated in a number of ways, and that such facili- 
tation or arrest is made evident by means other 
than error in the results. One aspect which must 
be considered in detecting facilitation or arrest 
is time. If, under the new conditions, the results 
are secured in less time, attention may be said to 
be facilitated. If more time is required, attention 
may be said to be arrested. If the time remains 
constant, then facilitation is shown if there are 
less errors in the results, and arrest is shown if 
there are more errors in the results. A second as- 
pect of importance is the nwmber of objects 
which can be attended to as objects within a given 
time, and under the new conditions. If more ob- 
jects can be cognised under the new conditions, 
then attention is facilitated, if less, attention is

arrested. When the time remains constant, then 
increase in the complexity of the given field will 
result in more errors if attention is arrested, and 
less, if attention is facilitated. The third means 
of showing facilitation or arrest is the number of 
errors which results. If the time remains con: 
stant, and the given field remains constant, then 
arrest is shown if the new conditions produce 
more errors, and facilitation is shown if they 
give rise to less errors. The conditions under 
which facilitation or arrest may be produced will 
be considered in the following sections. It is 
seen that extraneous stimulation is only one of 
a number. 
(a) Simplicity versus complexity. Of the two 
given fields, the one which is more complex will 
hold attention a longer time. This is shown by 
the following test, in which, for each series of 
100 fluctuations in attention to the simple figure,

In Hylan’s tables, the same is shown by the test 
of error. When the time remained constant, and 
the observer was asked to give the arrangement 
of each of the parts of the given field, the wrong 
cases averaged 34 per cent when the field con- 
sisted of five lines, 62 per cent when it contained 
five numerals, 178 per cent for five letters, and 
1900 per cent for five words. When the number 
of objects was four instead of five, the per cents 
were, for lines, 10 per cent, for numerals 35 
per cent, for letters 60 per cent, and for words 
111 per cent. The time exposure in these tests 
was one tenth of a second.”” Cattell found that 
it took much longer to recognise and name a 
color or a picture, than it did a letter or a word.

pleasurable or painful situations are well known. 
A field which is pleasing to the individual tends 
to hold the attention, one which is painful, to

The experimenters make this additional note:

disagreeable object; the tendency to make particular 
movements of adaptation to stimuli; etc.22 
Lloyd Morgan’s experiments with animals 
show the same thing. 
To some other chicks I threw cinnabar larvae, dis- 
tasteful caterpillars conspicuous by alternate rings of 
black and golden-yellow. They were seized at once, but 
dropped uninjured; the chicks wiped their bills—a sign 
of distaste—and seldom touched the caterpillars a second 
time. The cinnabar larvae were then removed, and 
thrown in again towards the close of the day. Some of 
the chicks tried them once, but they were soon left. The 
next day the birds were given brown loopers and green 
cabbage-moth caterpillars. These were approached with 
some suspicion, but presently one chick ran off with a 
looper, and was followed by others, one of which stole 
and ate it. In a few minutes all the caterpillars were 
cleared off.?* 
Attention may be attracted by a situation 
which excites feeling, but the persistence of such 
attention is determined in part by the pleasure- 
pain elements which enter. One can, of course, 
attend to a situation in spite of the pain which 
exists, but, other things remaining the same, at-

tention will tend to persist when the situation is 
pleasurable, and to lag when it is painful. 
When pleasure-pain elements are present ina 
situation, they tend to impel attention. The 
strength of the shock is dependent upon the 
suddenness and the intensity of the impressions 
which impel consciousness. In order of their 
stimulating efficacy are situations which produce 
(1) profound emotions, (2) violent affective 
conditions, (8) transitory and superficial emo- 
tions, unexpected impressions, intense impres- 
sions, (4) continuous sensations, and (5) quiet 
mental application under favorable conditions. 
On the other hand, the stability and regularity of 
attention are conditioned by situations which 
produce the above changes in reverse order.** 
(c) Quality of the impression. When an im- 
pression is more intense, it produces a greater 
shock and stimulates attention more than when 
it is weaker. Angell and Thompson found that 
of two noises, when both were unexpected, ‘a loud 
noise produced a much more violent shift of 
attention than a slight one.*° A strong stimu- 
lus will produce the same effect as a weak one in

half the time, that is, attention is more readily 
aroused by the more intense impression. As 
Lough shows, 
A strong stimulus acting for half the time necessary 
to produce its maximum effect gives rise to a sensation of 
exactly the same intensity as that produced by half as 
strong a stimulus producing its maximum effect.?* 
Differences between black and white are much 
more quickly perceived when the sensations are 
more intense. As the differences between the 
shades become smaller, i.e., as the impressions 
become weaker, the time necessary to discrimi- 
nate them becomes longer. Intensity of impres- 
sion may therefore be considered as a facilitating 
influence as far as the impelling of attention is 
concerned.” 
An impression, too weak in itself to excite 
attention, will finally succeed in stimulating 
attention if repeated. This phenomenon is 
known as ‘summation of stimuli.’ A succession 
of weak impressions then has the force of one 
more intense stimulus.

(d) Time. When more time is allowed during 
an act of attention, facilitation results, when less 
time is given, arrest follows. In Griffing’s tests, 
a decided fall was shown in the number of letters 
seen, when the exposure was reduced from one 
second to one tenth of a second, and a still 
greater fall was evident in the number seen cor- 
rectly. Arrest is here shown both by the de- 
crease in the number seen, and by the increase in 
the errors.® The tests of Cron and Kraepelin 
show a similar decrease in the number of right 
cases seen when the time of exposure is decreased. 
With apertures respectively 5 mm., 4 mm., and 
8 mm., the corresponding time exposures were 
290 c, 230 c, and 170, (« equals a thousandth

through these openings, more wrong cases oc-

corresponds to some aspect in the given situation. 
In a series of tests Miinsterberg showed this con- 
clusively. He used 400 pictures 5 times each, thus 
giving 2,000 exposures. Two seconds before he 
showed a picture to the observer he called out a 
word. The picture was then shown and the sub- 
ject was asked to tell what he saw. Of the 2,000

cases, 617, or more than a third, were directly 
influenced by the word called out. The subject 
was not supposed to look for the object in the 
picture, in fact did not know that there was such 
an object as the word represented. In almost 
all of the other cases the picture was seen as a 
whole, or several objects in the picture were seen 
at once. In the 617 cases, on the other hand, a 
single object in the picture was distinctly seen.*® 
The effect of ideal reinforcement is very manifest 
in individuals who see ‘ghosts,’ and in whom 
imagination overrides objective presentations. 
Ideal reinforcement also plays an important part 
in holding some topic in the focus of attention. 
In such cases associations are revived which en- 
able some aspect of the field to persist in the 
field of clearness and distinctness. 
(h) Practice. Practice facilitates attention, 
lack of practice arrests it. One who has had suffi- 
cient practice in a given field can attend more 
easily, more accurately, and more rapidly. In 
continuous work the effects of practice are les- 
sened in part by the increasing fatigue. After a 
rest, however, the effects of practice are shown 
by the higher level of the results. In memorising

When the activity is more or less new the rise 
in the curve may be somewhat steep. A level is 
finally reached much below or above which the 
curve does not go. The effect of the practice is 
then at its best. In reading Hungarian text for 
five quarter hour periods for 24 successive days 
(with one day’s intermission on the thirteenth 
day), Weygandt obtained the following results 
for the first quarter of an hour on each day. The

An interesting series of experiments was carried 
on by Bettmann. He produced a state of fatigue 
in two ways, first, by one hour’s continuous addi- 
tion, and second, by a two hours’ tramp. Work 
done while in a fatigued condition was then com-

In the last test the mental fatigue was produced 
by one half hour’s addition, and the bodily 
fatigue by one half hour’s walking. The effects 
of fatigue in these tests is shown (1) by a de- 
crease in reaction time, (2) by an increase in 
error, (8) by a decrease in the number memo- 
rised, and (4) by an arrest of the effects of prac- 
tice. The following curves show the effects of 
practice under normal conditions and the arrest 
of such effects in a condition of fatigue. The 
curves are based on the memory tests.

(j) Pause. Under some conditions, pause 
with rest is favorable to the work immediately fol- 
lowing, under other conditions it is unfavorable. 
During continuous work, the impulse to work 
gradually decreases, while the fatigue gradually 
increases. A pause with rest should then come 
when the impulse to continue the work is weak,

  THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 65 
and while the effects of fatigue are strongly in 
evidence. If, however, the impulse to work is 
strong and the fatigue is not great, a pause may 
be unfavorable to good results. The length of 
the pause, too, affects the work immediately fol- 
lowing. If the pause is too long the effects of 
practice may be greatly diminished, and the 
impulse to work may become very weak. If the 
pause is too short the impulse may be interfered 
with and the effects of fatigue may still be strong 
enough to hinder further effort.** A number of 
experiments show that (1) a 5 min. pause at the 
end of a half hour’s work is favorable, (2) a 
15 min. pause under the same conditions is un- 
favorable, (3) a 15 min. pause at the end of an 
hour’s work is favorable, (4) a pause of over a 
day is unfavorable.*® The general effects of 
pause with rest are (1) passing away of fatigue, 
(2) weakening of the impulse to work, and (8) 
decrease in the effects of practice."

66 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
When the pause is filled with a different kind 
of work the effect on a continuation of the origi- 
nal work depends upon the kind and the difficulty 
of the work interpolated. If the interpolated 
work is of a difficult nature it may interfere with 
the work following. Thus, if memory work is 
interpolated between periods of less difficult 
work, the periods following the interpolated 
work show a decided fall in the results. The fol- 
lowing tables and curves give some indication of 
the effect of such interpolated work.

when it is the same in kind, and (2) when it is

(k) Hunger. A most interesting series of 
tests was made by Weygandt to establish the 
effects of hunger on mental work. He went 
without food for periods of 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 
hours, and while in this condition went through 
a number of experiments. The results of his 
tests showed (1) that simple apprehension of 
syllables and words was not hindered to any 
great extent, (2) that association time was not 
influenced much, (3) that memorising was 
arrested, (4) that distraction had a greater 
arresting power, and (5) that reaction with 
choice gave a larger number of errors. The 
results of some of his work are given below.**

The afflicted subjects showed greater fatigue 
and less practice effects. The paralytics were 
least efficient in this respect. 
(n) Extraneous stimulation. When two ac- 
tivities are in the same field or in related fields, 
one will tend to arrest the other. Vogt recited 
a poem orally, and at the same time added single 
figures without writing down the answers. He 
found some difficulty in retaining the sums in his 
memory. Interference was also felt with the 
muscular-acoustic images of the sums, and there 
was eye-strain due to an effort to visualise the 
sums. During the first day only oral rendition 
of the poem was attempted. On the second and 
third days addition of figures was included dur- 
ing the second half hour of the work. The ratios 
of the number of syllables recited with and with- 
out interference is given in the last column. The 
results of the tests are as follows.**

It is to be noted that during the third periods, 
more work was done, but each was somewhat 
arrested. In crossing out letters Vogt found 
that he made more errors and marked less letters 
with a text having meaning than with nonsense 
words. The meaning of the text acted as an 
arresting influence.” 
When stimulation is in two fields not closely 
related, excitation in the one may facilitate atten- 
tion in the other. Darlington and Talbot found 
that while music was played on a piano during 
the lifting of weights, there was better discrimi- 
nation than when no music was played. So, too, 
“See also Kleinknecht, H., ‘The Interference of Optical 
Stimuli” Harvard Psychological Studies, 2:299-308.

78 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
Moyer concludes from a series of experiments 
that visualisation of colors, hearing of sounds 
made by falling balls, and the smelling of odors 
are not arrested by such processes as adding, 
writing, and the like. In these tests the criterion 
of arrest was error. There was no record of 
time. Some arrest may have occurred in the 
increase of time due to the added activity. Even 
though there were no more errors in the tests, 
there might have been an increase in the time 
needed to discriminate the weights, recognise the 
odors, add, etc.** 
In retinal rivalry, one figure in the stereoscope 
may be considered as an influence which ar- 
rests the other. When the figure has some 
content it tends to hold the field longer than one 
which is empty, i.¢., to arrest the simpler figure 
for a longer time. Breese recorded the time 
during which each of a number of figures held 
the attention. His results are given in the table

(a) Literary. 
It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many 
objects to attract attention, that at first Nicholas stared 
about him, really without seeing anything at all. By 
degrees, however, the place resolved itself into a bare and 
dirty room with a couple of windows, whereof a tenth 
part might be of glass, the remainder being stopped up 
with old copybooks and paper. There were a couple of 
old rickety desks, cut and notched, and inked and dam- 
aged, in every possible way; two or three forms, a 
detached desk for Squeers, and another for his assistant. 
The ceiling was supported like that of a barn, by cross 
beams and rafters, and the walls were so stained and 
discoloured, that it was impossible to tell whether they 
had ever been touched with paint or whitewash.—Nicho- 
las Nickleby, Dickens. ; 
Suddenly I: perceive on my right, not far from me, a 
large dark object which I had not noticed before, and 
which is lightly and noiselessly approaching my ambush 
and the watering-place. Without a halt the dark, 
mighty mass comes nearer and still nearer. Now I can 
plainly see that there are two objects, one in front of 
the other. They stand opposite me, not more than one 
hundred and fifty paces off. They are rhinoceroses, full- 
grown ones, coming here to drink. How gigantic they

4, FACILITATION AND ARREST. 
With proper laboratory equipment, any of the ex- 
periments described in the preceding section can be 
repeated. For purposes of illustration, simpler ones can 
be tried. 
(a) Simplicity versus complewity. 
Place two figures in a stereoscope, one simple, one com- 
plex. Note the difference in the time in which each holds 
the attention. (The figures used by Breese are good. 
See above, Table X XVI). 
Why does it take longer to read the words of a page, 
than to read the letters of the same page? 
(b) Time. 
Read the words of a page and note the time. Try 
to read two pages within the same time. What will be 
the result? 
Mark all the a’s in a text for a period of fifteen min- 
utes. Try to mark the same number in eight minutes. 
Note the result, with reference to (1) number of letters 
marked, (2) number of errors, (3) number of letters 
skipped. 
(c) Age. 
Let children of different ages read for five minutes.

compare these numbers with the ages of the children. 
Repeat Griffing’s tests. 
(d) Preadjustment. 
Let children add single figures read out to them, with 
signal, and without. (Some signal, as ‘Ready,’ or ‘At- 
tention,’ may be used.) Give such sums with (1) regular 
signals, (2) irregular signals, (3) no signals and irregu-

minutes in the afternoon of each of ten successive days. 
Compare the numbers marked and plot the corresponding 
curve. On the eleventh day, read some text and note the 
appearance of the a as compared with the other letters. 
(g) Fatigue. 
Mark a’s for an hour or an hour and a half, and note 
the number marked every five or ten minutes. Plot the 
corresponding curve. 
Produce fatigue by an hour’s continuous addition, 
and read for half an hour. Count the number of sylla- 
bles read. Read for half an hour at the same time on 
the next day when not fatigued. Compare the results.

hour. Compare the results. Vary the periods of pause 
and the periods of work. Add figures, memorise non- 
sense syllables, etc., under similar conditions. 
Mark a’s half an hour, read for half an hour, mark a’s 
again, and follow with half an hour’s reading, in con- 
tinuous periods of half an hour each for a period of 
two and a half hours. Make the periods of work and 
rest fifteen minutes each. Compare the results with 
those obtained in marking a’s for two and a half hours 
without the interpolated reading. Use a day for each

§ III. DEVELOPMENT 
The general change in a field under fixation is 
from indistinctness to distinctness and from ob- 
scureness to clearness. In attention to any 
totality, the dim background gradually falls 
away and leaves the situation clear and distinct. 
Further manipulation and control results in a 
differentiation of parts, in greater systematisa- 
tion and order, in an increase of clearness. The 
process, in short, is from discreteness to unity. 
In the passage from childhood to adolescence, 
and then to adult life, there is an increase in the 
grasp of attention at any given moment, and a 
greater ability to hold attention for a longer 
period of time. The tests of Griffing show the 
development in the grasp of attention and 
Messmer’s tests in reading indicate a similar 
development. As children grow older they are 
able to grasp more at a given moment, and to do 
this within less time.

1. Bronocican; Reaction, adjustment and 
control are not effective vitally unless there is a

. more or less distinct field before the organism. 
The essential aspect of a situation, the stimulating 
part of the field, the pleasure-pain feature of an 
environment must be singled out and selected if 
the individual is to persist as an individual. On 
this account every part of the organism strains 
to further the production of distinctness in the 
essential aspect of any background. The bull- 
dog jumps for his enemy’s throat. The deer 
turns his head towards a light, or a noise. Fail- 
ure in selection may mean death. The surgeon 
who marks the place where he is to operate, and 
carefully removes tissue, avoids blood vessels, 
and inserts a forceps or a knife, is an example 
emphasising the same thing. 
In social and economic control, progress in 
any field is similarly the result of selection and 
specialisation, A situation is first dealt with in 
a more or less general way, differentiation is 
gradually effected, and then, piece by piece, the 
situation is attacked, analysed, studied, recon- 
structed, and again united in a more highly 
developed form. The development of factories, 
branch stores, special departments, offices, agents, 
etc., is characteristic of present-day life.

ness, and persistence. The distinctness, etc., of 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 89 
a situation is due to two sets of influences, (1) ob- 
jective, and (2) subjective. Some of the more 
important of the objective conditions which give 
rise to clearness and distinctness are (1) differ- 
ence, (2) change, (3) pleasure-pain, and (4) 
time. An impression differing greatly from 
those concomitant with it will tend to attract 
attention. The effects of difference in the in- 
tensity of impressions has been experimentally 
shown.°* Common observation points to the 
same. A loud noise, a sudden report, a straw hat 
in winter, a cooling breeze on a hot day, the note 
of a piccolo or the clang of a triangle in an 
orchestra, these attract the attention. Change 
or variety also tends to stimulate and hold the 
attention. An object which is more complex may 
cause the attention to persist for a longer time. 
A simpler object may be more readily cognised, 
but its holding powers are not so strong. Pleas- 
ure-pain excites attention as already indicated 
in the preceding section. Finally, when more 
time is allowed, the development of clearness and 
distinctness are facilitated. 
Of the more important subjective factors 
which facilitate clearness, distinctness, and per- 
sistence are (1) preadjustment, (2) reinforce-

ment, (8) practice, (4) pause (rest), (5) age, 
and (6) natural vitality and mental ability. 
When one expects an impression and is ready to 
receive it, the organs, muscles, etc., are set in a 
certain direction. There is less waste in reaction 
and the field does not become blurred or indis- 
tinct through wrong or inadequate adjustments. 
When there is ideal reinforcement, the incoming 
impression is received by a disposition or system 
of images or ideas. By association, the impres- 
sion is enabled to persist in the series of images 
or ideas revived. Attention to a time-table is an 
example of such persistence. Practice facilitates 
attention in that there is little waste. The situa- 
tion and the organism fit each other. The organic 
set of the individual corresponds so closely to the 
different aspects of the situation, that the latter 
is enabled to flash into the focus of consciousness 
at once. Rest allows all the other factors to 
operate in their full strength. An older indi- 
vidual is better able to attend since his wider 
experience is accountable for more perfect prac- 
tice, more highly organised mental dispositions 
and systems, and a more economical distribution 
of energy. 
(b) Fluctuation. By considerable experi- 
mentation, the following facts have been ascer- 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 91 
tained in connection with physiological changes: 
(1) Blood pressure sinks with every inspira- 
tion and rises with every expiration, though such 
concomitance is not exactly synchronous. 
(2) Several such movements are contained 
in a larger rhythm, the so-called Traube-Hering 
wave.*® 
(3) Sensory stimulation tends to affect 
respiration and increase the length of the Traube- 
Hering waves. 
(4) Fatigue, as evidenced by diurnal changes, 
tends to shorten the Traube-Hering waves. 
(5) Pathological conditions, either natural 
(abnormal depression) or artificial (stimulation 
by alcohol), tend to shorten the Traube-Hering 
waves and to induce fatigue. 
These vasomotor rhythms are controlled by a 
system of vasomotor nerves which have their cen- 
tre in the cervical region and which control 
constriction and dilation of the blood vessels. 
The rhythmic rise and fall of blood pressure is 
measured by the rhythm in the rise and fall of the 
volume of the arm or finger. 
By laboratory tests the following facts have 
= American Text-Book of Physiology, 1:201. Howell, William 
H., 4 Text-Book of Physiology, Ch. XXXII. 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
92 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
been ascertained with reference to fluctuation of 
attention to minimal stimuli: 
(1) Fluctuations of attention have a rhythm 
in which periods of brightest vision, for example, 
are succeeded by periods of dimmer visiun. 
(2) These waves correspond closely to 
Traube-Hering waves, and approximately with 
changes in respiration. 
(8) Sensory stimulation tends to increase the 
periods of distinctness and illumination while in- 
creasing the length of the Traube-Hering waves. 
(4) Fatigue, as evidenced by diurnal changes, 
tends to decrease the periods of distinctness and 
illumination, while decreasing the length of the 
Traube-Hering waves. 
(5) Pathological conditions affect the rhythm 
of fluctuation as they do the rhythm of the 
Traube-Hering waves. 
In attention to minimal impressions, the fluctu- 
ations are in all probability conditioned by vaso- 
motor and respiratory changes. In part, fatigue 
of end organs and fluctuation of muscles of 
accommodation operate in causing fluctuation. 
In attention which is conditioned in part by 
accommodations of end organs and by ideal rein- 
forcement, fluctuation does not exist in a pure 
state. In such a case it may be controlled in part 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 93 
by ideal and motor elements. This may happen 
in the case of retinal rivalry or in attention to 
such complex figures as Schroder’s stair figure 
or Necker’s cube. 
In fluctuation, the changes in vasomotor action 
and respiration are normal physiological changes 
which condition attention to minimal stimuli and 
affect the periodicity of efficiency as shown in the 
fluctuations. It should be noted that such 
changes are not the ones which result when active 
control of a situation is attempted. Changes 
which follow active control and attention are the 
result of attention in such a case and not the 
conditioning substratum. Fluctuation of atten- 
tion is a most interesting problem for in it we 
have attention in its purest state and as close to 
a general power in a sensory field as can be 
found. In a more advanced stage, attention is 
conditioned by acquired ideal and motor elements 
which further persistence, and guide attention 
one way or the other. Individual instincts and 
capacities also direct attention into special fields, 
It might be of interest to see whether or not per- 
sistence in any special field can be measured by 
the length of the periods of distinctness in fluc- 
tuation waves, and by Traube-Hering rhythms. 
(¢) Unity. Since efficiency of control is 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
94 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
facilitated by narrowing and specialising a given 
field, unity will tend to be selected in preference 
to distribution of attention. Moreover, complete 
control is possible only when a given totality is 
presented as a unitary whole. We have but a 
single body with which to take an attitude, a 
single pair of hands with which to work and 
manipulate an object or situation. The visual 
field, too, holds objects together in an elliptical 
form which may become further narrowed in 
motor control. Finally, when too many objects 
strive to hold the focus of attention, there results 
a feeling of strain, of unrest, of dissatisfaction, 
even of pain. On this account there will be a 
tendency to shut out such disturbing situations, 
and to seek or construct more simple and unified 
ones. It is a remarkable fact that most systems 
of philosophy seek to find some universal prin- 
ciple, law, ground, ete., which will explain the 
multiplicity of events. The tendency to explain 
things by simple reasons, and to connect phe- 
nomena through analogy is probably due to the 
same cause. Unity gives ease, rest, and satisfac- 
tion, and so is sought even when the seeking dis- 
torts truth. 
The apparent discreteness in the field of visual 
attention in which from three to five objects seem 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE OBJECTIVE ASPECT 95 
to be discriminated at a single glance is due 
probably to retentiveness, development, and suc- 
cessive acts of attention upon memory images. 
Young children are not able to grasp as many 
objects at a single glance as are older children, 
and when the time of exposure of the objects is 
shortened, fewer are seen at once. When an 
individual sees four objects, he sees not four indi- 
vidual objects, but a group which is associated 
with ‘fourness.’ From long experience with 
such groups, e.g., four corners, four fingers, etc., 
they come to mean ‘four’ to him. The associa- 
tion is one of words and meaning. Without such 
experience, as in the case of children, apprehen- 
sion of objects becomes narrowed to one or two. 
When the objects are grouped they are seen as 
a ‘four’ group, a ‘five’ group, and the like. Prac- 
tice will enable an individual to visualise groups 
containing a much larger number of objects. 
In the case of auditory fields, the rhythm 
probably takes the place of the visual group. 
The rhythm is apprehended as a whole, and by 
experience associated with ‘four’ or ‘eight,’ etc., 
as the case may be.

CHAPTER IIT 
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT OF 
ATTENTION 
§ I. DESCRIPTION 
1. Ipgat. An impression in itself has little 
lasting power. It passes into consciousness and 
flits out without remaining long in the focus of 
attention. But little experience, however, is 
necessary to modify the pristine purity of im- 
pressions and to give them meaning one way or 
the other. Connections are made, ideal disposi- 
tions are formed, a mental set is developed, and 
what was originally a lone sensation is soon 
seized and held within the field of consciousness 
by the mental setting which has been acquirede 
Such ideal reinforcement may take the form 
of simple assimilation or of free association. 
Whichever be the case, the impression is lifted 
into the focus of consciousness and held there by 
ideal traces and dispositions. 
(a) Fusion, assimilation and complication.’

geben von G. Hartenstein, 5:21-24, or 4 Teat-Book in Psychology,

Psych., Ch. XIX, § 2. 
96 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 97 
Each of these three forms of association deals 
with single moments of conscious apprehension. 
The incoming impression meets with ideal dis- 
positions, and together these form a single per- 
ception, image, or idea. Fusion may be intensive, 
as in the case of sounds and feelings, or extensive, 
as in the case of visual and tactile impressions. 
In the former case a number of separate ele- 
ments, as fundamental and overtones, are com- 
bined into a single complex called a tone. In 
the latter case visual elements as such, and motor 
elements are combined to give perceptions of 
distance, space and the like. 
In assimilation, revived elements reinforce an 
impression, round it out, and give it meaning. 
A few strokes, for example, will outline the 
features of a known personage, while the begin- 
ning of a familiar word is usually all that is 
necessary to bring the whole to mind. The nu- 
merous proof reader’s errors are an indication 
of such assimilation. Fluctuation of the more 
complex figures as the cube or the staircase may 
also be controlled in part by it. 
Complication is a loose form of simultaneous 
association and may at times pass over into free 
association. Thus, attention to a piece of silk 
may excite the feel of it, and the sight of water 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  98 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
may revive the impression of wetness. A view 
of a knife, too, may rouse tendencies to use it, 
or the thought of some action may call up ten-_, 
dencies to motor control. Such associations may 
be concomitant with the impression or idea. If 
attention persists, such impressions or ideas may 
unroll into a train of thought or a series of 
reactions. 
(b) Free revival. A situation may excite 
an image, idea, or a series of ideas. Each in 
turn will reinforce aspects of the situation in the 
focus of attention and will keep it in the field 
of clearness and distinctness. The field in the 
focus of control may rouse images of previous 
events connected with it, or of surroundings in 
which it was experienced. It may revive an 
ideal system to which it belongs, or ideas of other 
situations to which it is a means, and which it 
may help to realise. As idea after idea rises and 
reinforces aspects of the situation under con- 
trol, attention to the situation in question per- 
sists. The more ideal connections which can be 
made, the longer will attention persist. Thus, 
one may take a time-table and examine it for a 
considerable time. “The words and figures in 
themselves can not hold the attention. But as 
they are connected with persons, events, places, 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
    THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 99 
memory images, and too often with the products 
of the imagination, they hold the centre of the 
attention field." 
Considerable laboratory work has been done 
for the purpose of finding the forms of asso- 
ciation which are possible in such ideal revival. 
It is found that a situation tends to revive an 
idea or an image of another situation with which 
it coexisted, or with which it is connected by 
some relation or series of relations. The former 
gives what is called synchronous association, or 
association by contiguity in time or place, the 
latter gives what is called association by simi- 
larity, cause and effect, purpose, design, or what 
not. Before giving a logical classification of 
situations which are represented by the revived 
images and ideas which act as reinforcing agents, 
it is necessary for one clearly to set forth what 
such a classification means. The terms ‘con- 
tiguity,’ ‘similarity,’ ‘purpose,’ etc., refer not to 
the ideas or images, but to the given situation, 
and the other situations with which it is or was 
connected in some way. Thus, if one attends to 
a book, and recalls bygone days when friends 
and companions were near by, the contiguity of 
such situations is in question, and not the con- 
tiguity of the ideas or images. So, too, if one
-P-A-G-E-106
  100 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
recalls a book like the one attended to, the image 
refers to a similar book. The similarity is a rela- 
tion existing between the objects and not between 
the ideas. The reason for such revival will be 
explained in a following section. Somewhat to 
anticipate, it may be noted that any contiguity or 
continuity of cerebral elements which underlies 
the ideal succession is very different from the 
contiguity of the situations when first experi- 
enced, 
Keeping in mind that the classification which 
is given below refers to forms of association, and 
to relations which are possible between situations, 
one may have any of the following:

(c) Deliberative. When a situation excites 
a number of attitudes which prevent immediate 
control, the individual selects various aspects of 
the situation in question, thinks them over, refers 
to past experiences, to authority, etc., weighs 
evidence, and either decides one way or the other, 
or leaves the question unsettled. From the psy-

of control. An individual who must pay the 
instalment on a mortgage and who is looking 
for means to collect the necessary money, is an 
example in point. 
When conflict in deliberation is strong, and 
attention is more or less intense, feelings of 
strain arise. These feelings are felt especially 
about the head and eyes. With older psycholo- 
gists this is sometimes mistaken as a sign of 
some general activity of attention or will which 
is supposed to stand over and above the process 
directing selection and choice. That such strain 
is due to peripheral stresses is shown by the fol- 
lowing facts: 
(1) Feeling of effort arises when there is 
conflict in deliberation, or when, in the process 
of attempted control, accommodation is inade- 
quate, i.¢., when attention is not wholly effective. 
When attention is more effective, such feelings 
of strain tend to disappear. It is the problem 
which baffles, the situation which is troublesome, 
the flux of impossible conditions, ete., which cause 
worry and strain. 
(2) If an individual strains his right arm in 
attempting to raise an object, he will feel a 
strain on the right side of his head. This would 
not be the case if the feeling of strain depended 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 103 
upon psychophysical conditions. In such a case, 
they would be felt on the left side.* 
(3) Increase in the intensity of attention is 
not always accompanied by more intense feelings 
of strain and effort. When one is beginning a 
task, or is attempting something new, or is tak- 
ing up work long since forgotten, the preliminary 
adjustments excite more intense feelings of 
strain than later control. As control becomes 
more effective, and as attention increases in ef- 
ficiency, feelings of effort tend to become less. 
(4) One can produce the feeling of strain 
artificially. If one contracts the forehead in- 
tensely for a time, makes the scalp tense about 
the frontal region, and if possible draws the ears 
back, a feeling of strain will be noticed much like 
feelings of strain in mental deliberation. After 
concentrated mental work, the feeling of strain 
and incipient fatigue can be aggravated by these 
means. In all this, what is denied is not the ex- 
istence of any psychophysical activity, but only 
its appearance, as such, in the realm of sensation. 
In referring to attention as selecting, discrimi- 
nating, and the like, what one means is not some 
special activity, but the activity of the individual 
in attempting fuller control. His motor adjust-

ments and innervations, his ideas and images 
which reinforce incoming sensations, these, taken 
together, result in discrimination and produce 
clearness and distinctness. 
2. CrerepraL. In outlining the cerebral con- 
comitants of mental activity, one must consider 
the ideal elements in connection with the motor. 
The functional unit is not sensory alone, but 
sensorimotor. In dealing with the psychological 
aspect, one may consider ideal and sensory ele- 
ments apart from motor for purposes of discus- 
sion, but in treating the nervous substratum, the 
sensorimotor unit is best described by present- 
ing it as it is, a connected whole. 
(a) Reflex. The simplest sensorimotor are 
is the reflex are. A sensory stimulus is conducted 
by means of’ a sensory neuron to the posterior 
root of the spinal column, transferred to the 
anterior horn, and then is carried by means of 
one or more motor neurones to a muscle. This 
is the process which takes place at the level of 
the spinal column. The incoming stimulation 
proceeds by way of what are called afferent 
nerve fibres, the outgoing by way of efferent 
nerve fibres. Such an are is made somewhat 
more complex by collateral fibres which branch 
   
-P-A-G-E-111
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 105 
out from the nerves and connect the different 
cells. The sensory fibres which enter the pos- 
terior roots may pass upwards and give off a 
number of collaterals, or they may connect with 
intermediate cells which in turn are connected 
with motor neurones. The process, however, is 
always a sensorimotor one. 
ee Fie. X. Reflex arc. SS, sensory; M, motor. 
Facilitation of motor reaction occurs when two 
or more sensory stimulations discharge into the 
same motor system. Inhibition or arrest occurs 
when two conflicting motor systems are simul- 
taneously excited. The successful system in all 
probability then drains or diverts the energy ex- 
cited by the stimulus which tended to excite the 
inhibited motor response. If, for example, sa 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
106 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
and sb, two sensory stimuli, excite ma and mb, 
two motor nervous systems, mb may succeed in 
draining the energy excited in ma for its own 
use. This is a probable explanation of physio- 
logical inhibition or arrest.* Inhibition of spinal 
response may also be effected by cerebral activ- 
ity. Paths already made by previous experiences 
in the cerebrum lead the energy generated by the 
stimulus into higher levels, and so change the 
nature of the response. 
Skeletal arcs are connected with visceral arcs. 
The latter control respiration, heart-beat, dila- 
tion of arteries, etc. Reflex processes, besides 
terminating in an external motor response, may 
effect organic changes, as, changes in respiration, 
constriction of arteries, variation in heart-beat, 
and the like. Connections in the spinal cord 
between skeletal and visceral sensorimotor ares 
are made by means of collateral fibres. In ad- 
dition to connecting with motor nerve fibres, the 
sensory excitation may pass upwards and leave a 
trace in the cerebrum. The motor response may 
likewise be reflected back to a cerebral centre. 
Further connection is then made between the 
motor and sensory centres. It is this which gives 
a basis for higher, cerebral development.

Sensorimotor arcs of the spinal level, in gen- 
eral, are characterised by (1) the relatively great 
constancy and regularity of their response to 
sensory stimuli, (2) their general vagueness and 
indistinctness in the field of consciousness, (8) 
their great freedom from interference or arrest 
by the activity of higher levels, and in many 
instances of their own level, and (4) their de- 
pendence upon sensory stimulation.® 
(b) Cerebral. An important point to be noted

tion Process,’ Mind, 11:341,

108 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
in the structure of higher cerebral levels is that 
the single cells are essentially of the same nature 
as those of the spinal level, that is, that they 
are sensorimotor. 
Every part of the cortex receives incoming impulses 
and gives rise to outgoing impulses. Every part of the 
cortex is, therefore, both a termination of some afferent 
path and the beginning of some efferent path; it is, in 
other words, a reflex arc of a greater or less degree of 
complexity. We may suppose that every efferent dis- 
charge from any part of the cortex is occasioned by 
afferent impressions reaching that point from some other 
part of the nervous system. Whether or not there is 
such a thing as spontaneous mental activity cannot be 
determined by physiology, but on the anatomical side at 
least, all the structures exhibit connections that fit them 
for reflex stimulation, and many of our apparently 
spontaneous acts must be of this character.® 
A second important feature in the structure 
of the cerebral level is the complexity and rich- 
ness of the connections of the neurones. 
This anatomical fact would indicate that the greater 
mental activity in the higher animals is dependent, in 
part, upon the richer interconnection of the nerve cells, 
or, expressed physiologically, our mental processes are 
characterised by their more numerous and complex asso- 
ciations. A visual or auditory stimulus that, in the frog

for instance, may call forth a comparatively simple 
motor response, may in man, on account of the numerous 
associations with the memory records of the past experi- 
ences, lead to psychical and motor responses of a much 
more intricate and indirect character.” 
In such a case, impressions start nervous im- 
pulses which instead of passing out immediately 
by way of the spinal cord, enter the cerebral loop 
and receive further direction there. The im- 
pulse proceeds then in the following order: (1) 
peripheral sense organ, (2) afferent nerve fibre, 
(8) spinal sensory cell, (4) afferent tract, (5) 
cortical sensory cell, (6) commissural fibre, (7) 
cortical motor cell, (8) efferent tract, (9) spinal 
motor cell, (10) efferent nerve fibre, and (11) 
muscle or peripheral end organ.* 
The sensorimotor portion of the cerebrum con- 
sists of a number of more or less definitely local- 
ised centres. Among these are (1) the body 
sense area, (2) the visual centre, (3) the auditory 
centre, (4) the gustatory centre, (5) the speech 
centre, and (6) the motor area, Arcs of the 
cerebral level are characterised by (1) a less 
stable and fixed organisation, i.e., by a great 
variability in the direction of nervous discharge,

110 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
(2) the increase in complexity and richness of 
interconnections, (3) the clearness and distinct- 
ness of the situations which correspond with their 
activity, (4) a general tendency of the activity 
of any system to inhibit the activity of any other 
system, and (5) their relative freedom from 
immediate sensory guidance. 
(c) Frontal. Motor and sensory areas occupy 
the smaller portion of the cerebrum. The larger 
frontal region is occupied by what are now fairly 
well established as association areas. 
The association areas may be regarded as the regions 
in which the different sense impressions are synthesised 
into complex perceptions or concepts. The foundations 
of all knowledge are to be found in the sensations 
aroused through the various sense organs ; through these 
avenues alone can our consciousness come into relation 
with the external or the internal (somatic) world, and the 
union of these sense impressions is the general function 
of the association areas. This function of the associa- 
tion areas is indicated by the anatomical fact that they 
are connected with the various sense centres by tracts of 
association fibres. . . . 
Here, as elsewhere in the nervous system, it may be 
supposed that the efficiency of the nervous machinery is 
‘conditioned partly by the completeness and character of 
training, but largely also by the inborn character of the 
machinery itself. The very marked differences among 
intelligent and cultivated persons—for instance, in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 111 
matter of musical memory and the power of appreciating 
and reproducing musical harmonies—cannot be attrib- 
uted to differences of training alone. The gifted per- 
son in this respect is one who is born with a certain 
portion of his brain more highly organised than that of 
his fellow-men. . . . With our ideas of the organisa- 
tion of the brain cortex, and our knowledge that differ- 
ent parts of this cortex give different reactions in 
consciousness, it seems to follow that special talents are 
due to differences in organisation of special parts of the 
cortex.®

§ II. DEVELOPMENT 
1. Ipzat. The general order of development 
of the ideal dispositions which reinforce an im- 
pression or idea is from (1) impression to mem- 
ory, (2) memory to ideal construction, and (3) 
ideal construction to deliberation and choice. 
The special direction given to such development 
is due in part to experience and training, in part 
to natural capacity and talent. Environment 
and heredity are two factors which condition 
specialisation and efficiency. The general order 
of progression, however, is as indicated above. 
When an impression alone is able to control 
attention, we have primitive or instinctive atten- 
tion. When attention in part is sustained by a 
series of ideas or images we have assimilative or 
apperceptive attention. When conflict, delibera- 
tion and choice are factors which keep a situa- 
tion in the centre of attention, or when means are 
attended to because they are bound with an end, 
we have voluntary or selective attention. Other 
terms which are used are, passive and active, 
primary and secondary, involuntary and volun- 
tary, etc. These aspects, be it noted, constitute 
only a part of the attentive process. The other 
and equally important part is the motor control. 
(a) Primitive or instinctive. In its earliest 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
120 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
stages, attention is instinctive. A sudden noise, 
a differing or changing impression, or one pleas- 
urable or painful, will stimulate reaction, will, 
in general, impel consciousness towards it. An 
infant, at times, seems to be controlled almost 
wholly by external impressions. Test any very 
young child, by moving the finger before it, or 
by tapping, or by holding a colored stick or ball 
within its grasp, and note the result. 
(b) Assimilative or apperceptive. Such im- 
pressions leave traces which on the psychophysi- 
cal side are called dispositions or memories. When 
some basis of experience has been constructed, 
impressions no longer pass through lower levels, 
but are guided and controlled in part by the 
activity of higher levels. Selection by means of 
ideal reinforcement is now possible. Of the mul- 
titude of impressions which flock in through the 
different sense organs, some persist in the centre 
of consciousness to the exclusion of other impres- 
sions. Some impressions have a meaning to the 
individual because of the experiences through 
which he has gone. Associations are excited, 
ideal dispositions are aroused, and these enable 
the impression, which is facilitated, to remain 
longer in the centre of greatest clearness and 
distinctness. A selection from an opera which 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 121 
has been sung at school, which has been heard 
from the street hand-organs, etc., stands out with 
special distinctness when heard at legitimate 
opera. From an individual point of view, con- 
scious selection is in part nothing more than 
specialised ideal reinforcement of impressions 
which has been made possible through previous 
experience. 
(c) Secondary or voluntary. In the course 
of experience, some situations yield pleasure, 
ease, satisfaction, quiescence, and a general atti- 
tude favorable towards their control. When 
such situations are not present, only traces re- 
main in the form of memories, ideas, plans, and 
the like. Attempts to bring back such or similar 
situations, or to make them more stable, or to 
reconstruct them, impel attention both to the 
situation in question, and to means by which it 
may be realised. The situation is not present, or, 
if present, is not fixed. Possibilities of its real- 
isation or fixation excite the idea of means which 
may bridge the gap between the future and the 
present. An attempt is made to direct present 
control and attention in such a way that thought 
and action will lead to what is desired. Delibera- 
tion and choice in such a case are due to the num- 
ber of means which may be possible. Attention 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
122 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
to the situation persists in part because of desires 
and anticipations of pleasure, in part to the series 
of ideas which arise out of the end to be sought. 
Such ideas are evolved out of the end to be 
realised, and out of the situation under immedi- 
ate control. They serve to lead the individual 
from the present to that which is to be attained. 
A child, for example, who covets a toy, may plan 
to get it by saving his money, by coaxing his 
mother to get it, by making it himself, by ex- 
changing something else for it, by taking it out- 
right, and the like. In older persons, the means 
become more complicated. Sometimes years 
intervene between the beginning of attention to 
some means, and final realisation of the end. 
The means which lead to the end may be 
attractive or repelling. In either case they are 
secondary and of themselves might not persist 
in the centre of attention. Attention to them 
persists because of the connections which they 
have with the situation which is to be realised. It 
is this characteristic which leads one to give to 
attention the name of voluntary, secondary, or 
acquired. Much of the work of the world is 
done because of such secondary attention. In 
fact, most of the stability and persistence of 
work is due to voluntary attention. No doubt 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 193 
much of the work may be able to hold attention 
for a time in itself, but irregularity and lapses 
are prevented because of the connection of such 
work with an end which is to be realised. An 
individual may, no doubt, like to sit behind his 
desk and do his work. But the flesh is weak, and 
at times, external stimulation, temptations, a 
pleasant day, alluring company, temporary indis- 
position, and the like would probably overcome 
the attractiveness of the work itself > were it not 
for the end to which the work leads, and which 
would fail of realisation if lapses crept in. 
Schematically the process in attention may be 
represented somewhat as follows: A may repre- 
‘sent an idea or image of the situation which is to 
be realised, as, a check, a pleasant time in the 
country, ete., and a, b, c, d, é, etc., the means 
which lead to A, as work, attention to a book, 
deprivation of temporary pleasures, and the like. 
If the desire for 4 is strong enough, attention 
to a, b, c, ete., will persist because of their asso- 
ciation with 4. The means, a, b, c, etc., may or 
may not be pleasurable. They may hold atten- 
tion simply because they lead to a satisfying or 
pleasurable situation. Should they develop asso- 
ciations of their own they might then hold atten- 
tion in themselves. Such attention would then

be assimilative or apperceptive as above de- 
scribed. One 
at first for the purpose of passing an examina- 
tion, may in time come to like it for its own sake. 
Deliberation is usually necessary when two 
conflicting ends strive to hold the focus of con- 
sciousness, or 
selected for the solution of a problem, or for 
effective guidance to the end in view. In such 
a process ideal series are referred back to the 
situation in question, tested, applied, connected 
with further associations, referred again to the 
situation in the focus of attention, etc., and then 
finally accepted or rejected. The individual who 
desires to go 
  different places, seek means of travel, arrange 
money matters, check himself here or there to 
ensure effective control, and so on. The process 
is one with which most are familiar. 
On the ideal side the general order of devel- 
opment is somewhat as follows:

In the above discussion, only the ideal ele- 
ments have been presented. It must be remem- 
bered, however, that the entire process is a 
sensorimotor one, and that ideal reinforcement 
is only a part of the process. 
2. CEREBRAL. In cerebral development, the 
first centres to be developed are those of smell, 
sight, hearing, touch, and body sense (skin and 
muscles). Soon after this, the motor fibres 
appear. These are called the primary zone areas and have projection fibres, both sensory and motor. Later still, the association areas acquire 
their myelinated or sheathed fibres. Upon ana- 
tomical grounds the order of development may 
be said to be from sensorimotor impression to association and differentiation.!2 
(a) Reflex. The simplest act of attention 
from the cerebral side is an instinctive response 
to an external impression. A light, a sound, a 
sudden touch, etc., impel the sense organs to instinctive adjustment. Further response may also be excited. The nervous impulse passes

-P-A-G-E-132
126 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
by way of the spinal cord to some motor neuron. 
In addition, it passes up and leaves a trace in a 
sense tract of the cerebrum. The motor impulse, 
after effecting muscular response, produces a 
muscular sensation. This likewise is carried back 
to the brain and deposited in the corresponding 
sense tract. By these means experience leaves 
its mark on the individual, and builds up a sen- 
sorimotor basis for further use. 
(b) Cerebral. The various traces which are 
left in the cortex are connected in different de- 
grees of complexity. Visual combine with audi- 
tory and tactile impressions, and all lead in some 
way to the motor areas. Upon later excitation 
they serve to reinforce impulses which come from 
without. According as experience has developed 
traces will some cerebral dispositions be roused 
and others not. In other words, some impres- 
sions are selected or discriminated by the indi- 
vidual, and others inhibited. A botanist will see 
a flower in a light different from that of a florist. 
A cook may see in it something different from 
that which attracts the attention of either. In 
cerebral terms, discrimination and selection mean 
simply nervous reinforcement of an impression 
by means of residual traces of former ex- 
periences. No doubt natural tendencies have 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 197 
something to do with the acquiring of such 
experiences. But any cerebral reinforcement is 
dependent upon traces left by former impressions 
and reactions. 
(ce) Frontal. On the cerebral side further 
development consists in the connections which are 
made among the various traces left. Since many 
association fibres acquire their sheaths only late in life, and some not at all, it is evident that in- 
crease in the complexity of associations proceeds 
so long as the individual is active. Development 
in this connection is by no means restricted to the 
years of childhood. In voluntary attention, con- 
siderable motor control is necessary. On the cerebral side, however, there is nothing to indi- 
cate that in such attention the cerebral process is anything more than association and predom- 
inance of some system of dispositions. 
In cases of voluntary reactions the impulses take a longer pathway and involve a larger series of central nerve-elements, since from the point at which they enter the system they must pass to the cephalic end and back again to the efferent elements. At the same time, in a voluntary action, a greater number of impulses combine to modify the discharge from the efferent cells.!° 
Any feeling of strain which may be felt in

voluntary attention is simply sensation of mus- 
cular effort, end-organ adjustments, ete., as 
pointed out in a preceding section. 
gIV. EXPLANATION 
1. Ipzau. When an impression is lifted into 
the centre of attention, clothed with meaning, 
and reinforced by associations, one underlying 
law can be found to explain the process. The 
present moment on the ideal side consists of the 
impression, p, plus the revived elements which 
give to p its meaning and direction. The total 
state may be represented by pmn, in which m 
represents the meaning due to ideal revival, and 
n the tendency to pass onwards in the direction 
developed by previous experience. This whole 
moment then may excite a series of ideas or 
images which in themselves have meanings and 
tendencies. The process of revival may be 
represented by the series, 
pm,N, AmM,N, M,N, CMsNs* * * etc. 
These moments represent the process on the 
ideal side. If we represent the objects which cor- 
respond or have at some time corresponded with 
the mental states we have,

For example, suppose I attend to the book before 
me. This is a definite object, and corresponds 
to 1, 1’, etc., according as I have seen it a number 
of times in various connections. If I continue to 
look at it I may recall the store in which I bought 
it, the persons whom I met at the time, the use 
to which I have put it, and so on. Such ideas are 
represented by am, bmn, etc. But the 
actual situation, the store, for example, is repre- 
sented by 2, 2', etc. If we consider the mental 
states we can formulate some one law which will 
explain the ideal succession. If we consider the 
objects, however, to which the mental states cor- 
respond, as book-store, etc., we have forms or 
relations of association which give us contiguity, 
similarity, purpose, or what not. These points 
of view, if confused, lead to a misconception of 
the law of psychophysical association."4 
The law which underlies the ideal revival of 
reinforcing dispositions may be stated as follows: 
Any element tends to reinstate the en- 
tire moment of which it constitutes a 
part, which moment tends (1) to dif- 
fuse itself along some one of the paths

which have been formed, and (2) to leave 
a trace of itself as a whole for future revival 
and development. 
What we have is neither contiguity nor similar- 
ity, but rather continuity of ideal processes. 
Contiguity, similarity, etce., refer to the objects 
correspondent with the ideas. 
The special direction which such diffusion will 
take depends upon various factors in previous 
experience. These give rise to what are called 
extrinsic secondary laws of association, namely, 
(1) repetition, (2) vividness, (8) recency, (4) 
primacy, and (5) emotional congruity. They 
may be stated briefly as follows: 
(1) Situations which are frequently presented 
tend to develop dispositions which are readily 
revived. 
(2) Situations which are vivid tend to leave 
traces which are readily revived. 
(8) Situations which have been recently ex- 
perienced tend to leave traces which are readily 
revived. 
(4) First impressions tend to leave traces 
which are readily revived. . 
(5) Situations which excite an emotion leave 
traces which are readily revived when the emo- 
tional attitude is again taken even if for differ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-137

THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 131 
ent reasons. Revivability may be caused by 
reappearance of the situation itself, or, according 
to the law of association just given, by any other 
situation which has common elements, or which 
is objectively or formally connected with it as 
suggested in the forms or relations of association 
outlined in a section above. Thus, similar mem- 
ories may be roused by the sight of a friend, of 
his photograph, of his name, of a present from 
him, ete. The stimulus serves to rouse the whole 
disposition, which then diffuses in different 
directions. 
The secondary laws are probably variations of 
the one law of repetition. Thus, a vivid situation 
will leave a trace which is readily revived upon 
another occasion. This gives repetition of the re- 
vival with further associations. Such associations 
may stimulate other revivals, with increased repe- 
tition. So the process continues. First impres- 
sions operate in a similar manner. Thus, early 
impressions in childhood are~constantly resur- 
rected by our home surroundings, friends, house- 
hold gods, and the like. So, by repetition, they 
become imbedded more deeply in the memory. 
The same holds true to a certain extent for emo- 
tional congruity, and for recency. At bottom, 
repetition of impressions and revivals is the most

important means by which direction, order, and 
organization of associations become fixed. 
On the subjective side we have as intrinsic 
secondary laws of association, (1) organisation, 
(2) comprehensiveness, (3) codperation and 
strength of cohesiveness between parts, (4) the 
nature of the predominating sensory elements, 
and (5) general conditions of freshness and 
vitality of the individual’ Such organisation 
and systemisation will depend in part upon 
natural tendencies, and in part upon en- 
vironment and education. Briefly stated these 
intrinsic secondary laws are: 
(1) The direction and the duration of ideal 
diffusion and association are dependent upon the 
organisation of the mental dispositions aroused. 
(2) The number of associations which can be 
revived depends upon the comprehensiveness of 
the ideal systems excited. 
(8) The persistence of any ideal system de- 
pends upon the strength and number of its 
various parts. 
(4) The quality or the ideas or images 
revived depends upon the predominating sensory 
elements. 
(5) Organisation, comprehensiveness, etc., are 
5 Stout, G. F., Analytic Psychology, 2:Ch. VII, § 6-8.
-P-A-G-E-139
  THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL ASPECT 133 | 
more or less effective in facilitating the ease 
and duration of revival according as the indi- 
vidual is rested or fatigued. 
The function of the ideas, images, and dispo- 
sitions which are revived are (1) to reinforce 
incoming impressions and to inhibit others, i.e., 
to discriminate and select, and (2) to give guid- 
ance to motor attitudes and control. The former 
has already been described. A word or two is 
necessary to emphasise the latter. Ideas and 
images in themselves are bleak and barren. Only 
as they are accompanied by attitudes or more 
open motor response do they have life and real- 
ity. Even the most abstruse and speculative 
inquiries give forth tendencies and lead to atti- 
tudes which are satisfying, pleasurable, or the 
reverse. Such attitudes stand for, and in a way, 
represent the fuller motor explication which 
would follow in complete realisation of the ideas. 
This motor attitude will be considered fully in 
the next chapter. 
2. CrREBRAL. A sensory stimulus leads to a 
motor discharge because the nervous paths are 
organised that way. All nervous impulses pass 
in a forward direction from sense organ to sen- 
sory cells, and then to motor cells and to the 
muscles. In reflex and instinctive responses the 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
134 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
sensory stimulation alone is sufficient to open 
the nerve paths and start the complete sensori- 
motor process. 
In acquired responses, paths between the corti- 
cal cells are probably broken through by the 
localised emphasis of the tonic activity of the 
nervous system. The more or less uniform ner- 
vous pressure which is present during the waking 
state is raised in intensity by sensory stimulation. 
A heightened activity is thus produced in some of 
the cortical cells. Such activity flows forward 
towards motor cells. It also drains cells con-— 
nected with those excited by sensory stimulation. 
When several sensory cells are excited, the 
heightened diffusion of nervous energy in re- 
stricted portions of the cortex probably opens 
up connecting paths between them, some by 
pressure, some by drainage.'® Later excitations 
will then flow in such paths as have been opened, 
i.e., will pass along the line of least resistance. 
Individual capacity and organisation of cerebral 
cells and fibres may likewise condition the kinds 
of connections which can be made. 
The nervous processes which go on in acts of 
attention may be briefly explained. When a 
sensory impression is reinforced by an ideal dis-

position or a series of dispositions, the corres- 
pondent cerebral process is somewhat as follows: 
The nervous impulse passes along lines of least 
resistance to the cortex and diffuses into chan- 
nels which have been formed by previous exper- 
ience. Tonic activity of the cerebrum becomes 
heightened and focalised within narrow sensori- 
motor limits. Motor responses may result in 
further discrimination and selection of aspects 
of the situation and so give rise to more impres- 
sions, and stimulate greater sensorimotor activity. 
In abstract thought motor attitudes may serve 
the same purpose. The question of motor re- 
sponse is, in fact, one of the most important in 
the attentive process.’7

marked by a number of organic changes, some of 
which are more or less constant. The general 
organic changes involve (1) respiration, (2) 
vasomotor constriction of peripheral arteries, and 
(8) circulation.

-P-A-G-E-143
THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECT 137 
(a) Respiration. Concentrated attention usu- 
ally gives rise to rapid, shallow breathing. The 
inspiration becomes shorter, the expiration 
shorter, and the rate more rapid. The respira- 
tion may be slightly inhibited. Variations are 
possible, both in the rate and depth of the 
respirations. 
(b) Vasoconstriction. When the volume of 
the hand or finger is measured during attention, 
it usually shows a decrease due to a sympathetic 
constriction of the peripheral arteries. . Such 
constriction may be slowly succeeded by a grad- 
ual dilation of the arteries to the normal. It may 
be accompanied by dilation of the cerebral ar- 
teries and increase in the supply of blood to the 
brain. 
(e) Circulation. During attention the pulse 
becomes more rapid. There is always some vari- 
ation in the pulse during concentrated atten- 
tion of any kind. There is also found a change 
in blood pressure due in part to change in heart 
beat and in part to vasoconstriction of the ar- 
teries. Blood pressure tends to increase during 
periods of attentive activity. There seems like- 
wise to be a redistribution of the supply which 
favors those areas which have been called into 
service. In moments of concentrated mental ap-
-P-A-G-E-144
  138 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
plication it seems that the brain receives a greater 
supply of blood. It also shows a rise in 
temperature. 
2. Sensory. On the side of sensory accom- 
modation and fixation attention consists of (1) 
changes within the organ itself which facilitate 
adjustment, and (2) motor adaptations for the 
purpose of fixation. 
(a) Accommodation. In vision, the follow- 
ing changes take place during visual attention: 
(1) There is adaptation of the pupil which 
controls the admission of light and so conditions 
visual distinctness and clearness. 
(2) The surface of the lens changes, becoming 
more convex in the middle and flatter towards 
the periphery.” 
When external conditions are artificially va- 
ried the following changes may be noted: 
(1) When the eyes fixate a spot directly ahead 
and at the same time attend to an object out of 
line with direct vision, the pupil shows an increase 
in size. 
(2) When the light is decreased in intensity 
the pupil increases in size. 
(3) In mental processes which require no im- 
2Tscherning, M., Physiological Optics, Eng. tr. by C. Weiland, 
Ch. XII.
-P-A-G-E-145
THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECT 139 
mediate use of vision the pupil expands the most. 
At the same time the lens becomes correspond- 
ingly flatter.* 
Changes in the other sense organs are not so 
evident. In audition it is highly probable that 
the two intrinsic muscles of the ear, the tensor 
tympani and the stapedius, function as a means 
of accommodation for the tympanic membrane 
and for the membrane attached to the base of the 
stapedius. In tasting, the increased flow of sa- 
liva, and in smelling, the increased dilation of 
the nostrils and the stronger inhalations likewise 
function to bring about distinctness and clear- 
ness in the field of attention. 
(b) Fiwation. Control of a sensory situation 
involves fixation of the end organs. If the 
situation is a visual one, the eyes turn towards 
it and focus it. If auditory, the head turns in 
the direction of the sound. If tactile, the fingers 
feel and touch it. If gustatory, the tongue rolls 
it about and takes different shapes and posi- 
tions. The whole mechanism seeks to produce 
clearness and distinctness. Accurate observa- 
tions have been made in visual fixation. The 
movements of the eye have been photographed

Sinnesorgane,’ Zeit. f. Psych. u. Phys. d. Sinnesorg., 9:342-888

both in general fixation and in reading. It is 
shown by such photographs that the eye, in fix- 
ating a point, does not remain rigid, but fixates 
around the point, covering a small area. More- 
over, the two eyes are not exactly, but only ap- 
proximately coérdinate in fixating a point or in 
passing over a line from one end to the other.* 
In reading, the eyes cover the printed page by a 
series of rapid movements from left to right. 
These movements vary in number between 2 and 
7 for a single line and usually number from 4 to 
6. A slight pause occurs between each movement 
and the one which follows it. The area which can 
be seen at any single moment is represented ap-

‘more is read to the right of the fixation point

(8) Moror. An important factor in the at- 
tention process is the motor aspect. Even when 
actual motor control is not in operation, 
motor attitudes and innervations serve instead 
to give meaning to a situation and to effect sat- 
isfaction, ease, quiescence, or pleasure. The 
motor aspect of attention usually assumes three 
forms, (1) motor diffusions, (2) motor inner- 
vations or attitudes, and (8) complete motor 
control. 
(a) Motor diffusion. That ideas and images 
tend to realise themselves in action may be seen 
in moments of intellectual application. Hand, 
head and body movements indicate that nervous 
impulses are passing through motor channels. 
The head, face, fingers, and feet seem to be 
affected the most. A careful study of such auto- 
matic movements has been made by Lindley and 
the results of his findings are given below.* The

At the end of the rod is a cork. Through the 
cork is a pencil. Under the pencil is a smoked 
paper. When the hand is placed on the plate 
glass and attention is concentrated on something 
else, the direction of the movements as recorded 
on the smoked paper will indicate roughly the 
direction of the attention. Jastrow found that 
the hand moves in the direction of colors when 
they are recognised and named in horizontal 
rows, and from left to right or the reverse when 
they are named from left to right or from right 
to left. So, too, the hand movement tends to 
accompany the rhythm in counting the beats 
of a metronome, or, if not, to move towards the 
sound. In thinking of some hidden objects, the 
marks on the paper indicate roughly the direction 
in which the objects lie.® 
(b) Motor innervation. The tests just men- 
tioned may be considered in part as evidence of 
motor innervation. Definite tests by Miinster- 
berg and Campbell point to the same thing. If

an observer gazes at an object, closes his eyes, 
and then turns his head sideways, the eyes lag 
somewhat behind the head rotation, and in fact 
may not turn at all. This is shown by measuring 
the head rotation in degrees and the correspon- 
dent eye rotation, also in degrees. The subject 
opens his eyes as soon as he has finished turning 
his head, and the rotation of the eyes is immedi- 
ately measured, The following diagram shows 
a phase of the relative positions of head and eyes:

Even though the head has turned from O to H, 
the eyes still tend to fixate O which was looked at 
before the turning of the head began. The fol-

head and the eye rotations, such differences being 
conditioned by the nature of the stimulating

Images and ideas are strongly reinforced by 
motor innervations, especially when conflict arises 
or when greater distinctness is desired. In tests 
on the fluctuation of visual fields or changing 
perspectives, eye movements will reinforce one 
aspect at the expense of the other. Thus, if one 
fixates the staircase figure or the cube figure, 
motor innervations will determine in part whether 
the figure is to jut forward or retreat backward. 
In fixating a field of white dots on a black back- 
ground, the form, as, square, circle, triangle, etc., 
into which the spots fall, may be determined in 
part by innervations of the eye muscles and the 
head. 
Memory images of objects and places are 
made more definite by such innervations and 
movements. Distinctness and clearness are fa- 
cilitated by these motor aids, especially when 
shape, or size, or position, are in doubt. Situa- 
tions of greater complexity, as those which in- 
volve mechanical arrangements, movements of 
parts, machinery, and the like, can often be 
attended to only by the aid of motor tendencies

felt in the fingers, hands, body, and head. At 
times, such tendencies become realised in actual 
movements, or in the definite construction of 
schematic diagrams. Only by such aids can the 
ideal situation persist in the centre of attention. 
In more abstract application, the motor atti- 
tudes are usually overlooked. There will be 
found, however, pauses and intermissions in 
which the series of ideas or images is followed 
by a more or less definite motor attitude, or even 
by motor reactions. There may be a shake of the 
head, a body tendency towards or from some 
ideal situation, hand and finger movements to 
emphasise affirmation and negation, in short, a 
general attitude which determines in what direc- 
tion further thought should go. In addition to 
such definite pauses, there is a constant interplay 
between ideas and innervations, in which the 
former are tested, as it were, in a tentative man- 
ner. These motor innervations give rise to a 
feeling tone and reinforce one or the other series 
of ideas. In such cases the motor innervations 
and attitudes stand for actual manipulation and 
control. They give approximately similar feel- % See Lange, N., ‘Beitriige zur Theorie der sinnlichen Auf-

ings of satisfaction, pleasure, and the like. If 
the attitude is not sufficient to determine the 
validity of some train of thought, then actual 
motor control often follows. This process will 
be found even in the most abstruse and specula- 
tive inquiries.’ 
(c) Motor control. Actual manipulation is 
most in evidence (1) when the child is first learn- 
ing objective values, (2) when attention involves 
full control, and (8) when the meaning of an 
image or idea can not be determined or directed 
by motor innervations and attitudes, i.e., when 
there is conflict of meaning or doubt. When a 
new situation is presented to an individual or 
when he is suddenly confronted with it, attention, 
on the motor side, is characterised by an excess 
of movements. If satisfactory control is not 
immediately realised, a number of manipulations, 
some effective, some ineffective, are attempted. 
Out of a large number of movements, some are 
capped with pleasure, satisfaction, ete., and tend 
to persist. So long as control yields pleasure or 
satisfaction, the situation will tend to persist in.

Attention to objective situations consists 
largely of manual and similar adjustments. The 
object may be felt in a passive way, all parts of 
the hand coming into contact with it at once 
(synthetic touch), or the hand may explore the 
objective actively point by point (analytic 
touch).* Dissection, application, and recon- 
struction may change the situation entirely, 
affording new bases for sensory stimulation and 
yielding a richer meaning to the individual. The 
persistence of the attention will depend largely 
upon the points of contact which are possible by 
such motor control and upon the stimulations 
which can be produced by manual manipulation 
and reconstruction. A child, for example, who 
has a few blocks, will obtain a certain amount of 
visual stimulation from them. If he builds with 
them and rearranges them, he will give rise to a 
new source of stimulation. As he continues to 
play with them his different reconstructions 
enable his attention to persist because of the vary- 
ing situations which are afforded.?°

be established only by application through motor

means. An idea is tested by being applied to 
concrete situations. Where a motor basis has 
been established by experience, an attitude may 
take the place of more explicit realisation. In all 
such cases attention consists in the alternating 
process of ideal reinforcements and motor inner- 
vations. In both motor and ideal control, empha- 
sis upon any aspect of a situation necessarily 
excludes other aspects. There is no special and 
separate activity of inhibition in such a case. 
Inhibition is simply a name for the negative 
aspect of reinforcement. Aspects of a situation 
which are not eff ective in exciting ideal dispo- 
sitions or which are foreign to motor control will 
be unable to persist in the focus of attention, 
other things remaining the same. Such lack of 
persistence is called inhibition. Inhibition usu- 
ally implies predominance of some other aspect 
of a situation.’® Such inhibition becomes more 
and more prominent as the grooves of habit and 
thought become deeper. It corresponds with 
that which from the social point of view is called 
conservatism. As individuals grow older, new 
situations have less and less chance to excite 
attention or to persist in the focus of control.

of their own inherent impelling power to excite 
attention are the plastic ages of childhood and

4. Fatiavs. Concentrated activity, especially 
when it involves motor control, usually results in 
fatigue. There arises decreased irritability and 
increased slowness of response. Efficiency of 
attention begins to decline. In attention to mini- 
mal stimuli, the fluctuation periods become 
shorter. In simple reactions, the reaction time 
becomes longer. Objects in the field of atten- 
tion persist for a less time in the centre of con- 
trol. On the subjective side, fatigue is felt as 
weariness, disinclination to persistent effort, 
sensation of strain in the muscles, lack of interest 
in situations which normally are of an impelling 
nature, and sometimes as pain in the parts of the 
body affected. On the objective side, fatigue is 
manifested by a general slackness and listless- 
ness of the body posture, by relaxed fingers, and 
by asymetrical and fidgety movements. Coérdi- 
nations become more bungling, incorrect, and 
for finer control, often impossible. The eyes 
wander, lose the power of persistent fixation, 
and assume a general vacant expression. Re- 
sponse to stimulation becomes less exact and

requires more time than usual. In more ad- 
vanced stages of fatigue, there is a loss of con- 
trol, a great irritability, and an explosiveness 
which may be set off by trifling stimulation.” 
General bodily fatigue results in a general deple- 
tion of nervous energy and by diffusion affects 
all portions of the organism. Fatigue, however, 
may be localised in one or other sphere of activ- 
ity. In such a case continued activity within the 
sphere will give rise to manifestations of fatigue 
much like those of general fatigue.

much development. The motor, on the other 
hand, goes through a number of stages of de- 
velopment. 
1. Moror. Movements may be (1) reflex, or 
instinctive, (2) ideomotor, or (8) voluntary. 
(a) Instinctive. In instinctive or primitive 
attention a stimulus calls forth a motor response 
without further thought on the part of the indi- 
vidual. The sensorimotor process is realised 
automatically by virtue of the inherent nature 
of the nervous system. A reflex differs from 
an instinctive movement in that the former is 
simple in character and usually consists of a 
single movement, as, the winking of an eyelash, 
or sneezing. An instinct, however, consists of a 
series of codrdinated movements which involve 
a larger area. A sudden sound, for example, 
may cause a child to turn, lift its hands, and run 
without. The whole process is realised in a 
purely automatic manner.”* 
(b) Ideomotor. Such instinctive movements 
leave motor traces which facilitate further action 
and control. Moreover, the movements them-

selves become connected in a more or less defi- 
nite manner with situations both real and ideal. 
The instinctive responses become more accurate 
and refined.”° Any unnecessary movements 
which do not give pleasure or satisfaction fall 
away through a lack of such stimuli as impel 
repetition. The selected responses on the other 
hand become closely bound with impressions, 
images, and ideas. When attention is directed 
to a situation which is more familiar, the mere 
impression or idea results in a series of codrdi- 
nated movements which effect a definite purpose 
with comparatively little waste. In such a case 
the action is ideomotor. No consciousness of 
the act as such is involved. Simply the situation 
alone, as impression, image, or what not, excites 
proper motor codrdination and control. Com- 
mon examples are those situations in which re- 
vived series of images call forth a series of 
unconscious acts on our part. In attending to 
some object, for instance, we unconsciously place 
it in a certain position, get material to fix it, if 
necessary, and the like. In attention to some 
ideal] situation, as the thought of a book, or the 
image of a picture, one similarly feels impelled 
See Thorndike, E. L., Animal Intelligence. 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
164 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
to go for the bose look at the picture, ask for it, 
and so on! 
(c) Vi oluntary. When there is conscious 
selection of a movement, when an idea or image 
strongly impels action as preferential to other 
possible actions, when conscious choice is involved, 
the control is voluntary. On the ideal side there 
are usually deliberation and selection as already 
explained. On the motor side there is either an 
image of some action or a series of motor inner- 
vations and tendencies due to the dominance of 
an image or idea. When the situation to be 
realised is remote, the motor control becomes 
centred in a series of means. When the means 
have been worked out ideally and a course of 
action has been selected, the process of realisa- 
tion goes ahead almost automatically. The 
situation in question is fixated and the various 
aspects call forth motor responses of the kind 
which have been selected. In the choice of any — 
series of actions, the general tendency and direc- 
tion alone seem to be involved. Any further 
amplification and refinement become effected 
only when the actual process of control is under 
way. Further deliberation and choice may at

-P-A-G-E-171

time halt the process of control whenever such 
amplification becomes necessary. One who is 
seeking means to improve his work, who is con- 
fronted with a new problem, who is placed in a 
predicament, and the like, must select ways and 
means, try them, correct his errors, think out new 
plans, apply them, compare the results with 
previous efforts, and the like. The sensory and 
the motor intermingle, one reinforcing the 
other.” 
In the order of acquisition, random move- 
ments precede the more codrdinated and these 
are followed by selected and serial adjustments. 
In pathological conditions, however, a reverse 
order seems to be emphasised. The voluntary 
codrdinations, such as are found in speaking and 
writing, are lost first. Then come such stages 
as partial ataxia, rhythmic deafness, and general 
ataxia. : 
The general order of sensorimotor develop- 
ment is indicated in the following table:”*

g IV. EXPLANATION 
1. Oreanic. The changes in respiration 
which form a part of the attentive process are 
due in part to the localisation of control and to 
the inhibition thereby necessary. Those parts of 
the organism which are not called into play need 
not function so vigorously, and so do not necessi-

  THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECT 167 
tate the usual respiration. This is especially true 
in the case of mental application and in many of 
the laboratory tests which involve visual fixation, 
tactile reaction, and the like. Moreover, breath- 
ing may, by becoming too prominent, form a 
center of attention in itself or interfere with con- 
centration to other aspects of the situation. 
Vasoconstriction, changes in pulse, etc., like 
other biological aspects can not yet be fully ex- 
plained. With respect to attention, however, it 
is highly probable that such changes are neces- 
sary whenever effort becomes localised. The 
general tonicity of the system loses its more or 
less uniform character and becomes emphasised 
in those portions of the organism which are 
called actively into play. Increased demands by 
one part of the system necessitate some deple- 
tion in other parts. This is probably effected by 
vasoconstriction and other changes. 
2. Sensory. The function of the sensory 
adjustments in the process of attention is the 
fixation of the situation in the field of clearness 
and distinctness. The adaptations and instinct- 
ive changes in the end organs facilitate the 
reception of impressions while the motor accom- 
modations and movements serve to select aspects 
of the given field and to bring them out more 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
   
168 ATTEN’ ION AND INTEREST 
distinctly and clearly. When such fixation is 
accomplished more accurate and refined control 
becomes possible 
8. Moror. Motor adjustments and attitudes 
are essential in attention, not only to give greater 
distinctness and clearness, but, in more ideal 
processes, to indicate meaning and direction to 
the ideas and images which arise. The function 
of the motor attitude in meaning tends to be 
overlooked because it is so closely connected with 
the impression or image, and because it often 
exists only as a tendency. But without the 
motor attitude the visual or other image or im- 
pression would have little distinctive meaning. 
Visual differences aid in reviving such character- 
istic motor tendencies, but in themselves are no 
guarantee for any specific signification. This 
is shown in the early stages of a child’s develop-

Even in adult consciousness there seems to be 
nothing inherent in a visual situation as such 
which gives it a distinctive meaning. Why one 
object should be called ‘Pie,’ and eaten, and an- 
other ‘Cover,’ and placed on a bow] is not evident 
from the appearance of each, in itself. Only by 
a process of motor experience does each acquire 
a meaning. Similarly, ‘Come,’ and ‘Go’ have 
nothing in them as mere sounds to indicate ac- 
tions peculiar to each. Sweet points out the fact

that for some Germans the sound ‘het,’ stands 
for ‘head,’ ‘hat,’ and ‘had.’ Meaning in each of 
these three cases can not be due to the sound as 
such but must be accompanied in part by the 
motor attitude. In apraxia a loss of meaning is 
seen by the confusion which arises when a patient 
seeks to use objects. The visual situation is 
present but it seems to have no special significa- 
tion for the patient. One object is used for 
another. 
The patient will put his breeches on one shoulder and 
his hat upon the other, will bite into the soap and lay 
his shoes on the table, or take his food into his hand 
and throw it down again, not knowing what to do with 
it, etc.?” 
The diffusions and innervations which are pres- 
ent in attention to ideas or images probably 
serve to give meaning to the otherwise barren 
representations. By giving meaning, such motor 
attitudes serve to give direction and associative 
impulsion, for without meaning, one series of 
ideas would do just as well as another. Added 
vividness likewise results because of the motor 
attitude. 
In processes of deliberation which result in 
decision but no immediate action, it is the motor

attitude which determines selection and choice. 
Complete reaction may be unnecessary to decide 
whether or not one series of ideas or the other 
will result in satisfaction or pleasure, and the 
motor attitude takes its place. According as 
experience is more or less thorough and extensive 
will such attitude prove true. When an attitude 
is misleading, we call the judgment or the deci- 
sion false, z.e., if the attitude were fully realised, 
the actual manipulation and control would not 
effect what the attitude signified. None the less, 
whether right or wrong, the attitude is the de- 
termining factor in such ideal deliberation. The 
motor attitude becomes especially prominent in 
cases of conflict. When the smooth flow of 
thought, or the even rhythm of reading is blocked 
by a strange idea or expression which interferes 
with further interpretation and appreciation, a 
disturbance arises which manifests itself in motor 
expression of some sort. Such excitement may 
become extremely marked. It may develop into 
actual movement, or it may end in explosive 
expression,”®

sensorimotor activity waste products are found.

CO. is generated from the oxidisation of some 
of carbon constituents of the muscle. The 
glycogen gradually disappears. Sarcolactic acid 
likewise accumulates.”® When there is an excess 
of sarcolactic acid and acid potassium phosphate 
in the muscle it loses its irritability and contract- 
ility. It is less easily stimulated. It responds 
less easily in an accurate and determinate man- 
ner, in other words, it is physiologically fatigued. 
If the fatigue becomes too great there may fol- 
low a total lack of response to stimulation. It 
is evident that as fast as waste products are 
formed the muscle loses in material by this pro- 
.eess of decomposition. This also tends to inter- 
fere with the muscle response. 
The location of the physiological effect of 
fatigue is not in the muscle directly. By experi- 
ment fatigue has been found to operate in the 
motor plates. If, for example, one voluntarily 
lifts a weight or pulls a spring with the finger 
till fatigue prevents further response by such 
central stimulation, the finger will still respond 
to direct electrical stimulation, i.e., the muscle 
will contract in response to the electric stimula- 
tion. As the nerve fibre can not be perceptibly 
fatigued, only the motor end plates remain as 
%® Howell, W. H., Phys., Ch. Ul.

THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECT 178 
the seat of fatigue. So, too, if a nerve is elec- 
trically stimulated till no further muscle re- 
sponse is possible, the muscle will respond when 
directly stimulated. By elimination, the end 
plates remain.*© Finally, if a muscle is placed 
in a glass of curare, no contraction will be 
effected if the nerve is stimulated, while direc- 
tion stimulation of the muscle will still be effect- 
ive. In this case the poison acts on the motor 
end plates.** 
The changes which go on in the cortex are not 
so clearly known. Various facts, however, lead 
one to suppose that metabolic changes of some 
kind go on in the brain. Mosso, for example, 
found an increase in temperature in the brain 
correspondent with heightened mental activity. 
Since heat is the result of chemical change it is 
probable that some metabolism goes on in such 
a case. Hodge showed that in the case of the 
sparrow the spinal ganglion cells were shrunken 
at the end of the day and fuller after a night’s 
rest. Waller offers the following series of tests: 
If the gastrocnemius or leg muscle of a frog is 
excited by electric stimulation of the brain and

bulb till it no longer responds, it can still be 
excited by direct stimulation of the sciatic nerve. 
When such ila fails to excite response, 
a third series of contractions can be effected by 
means of direct excitation of the muscle. The 
fatigue in the first instance is probably condi- 
tioned by cra factors. Whether there is a 
less ready response within the cell itself, or 
whether the seat lies in the connections between 
the cell and the neurons, or what the process is, 
has not been determined. Connected with the 
whole process is probably the devitalised condi- 
tion of the blood through the fatigue by- 
products. 
The external conditions which produce fatigue 
are well known. Any thing which gives rise to 
the intrinsic conditions discussed in the above 
paragraph will cause fatigue. Excessive stimula- 
tion of some organ, muscle, ete., without intervals 
for recuperation will bring about fatigue. A 
lack of rest will have a similar effect. Pre- 
disposing conditions are a lack of proper nour- 
ishment, insufficient oxygination of the blood, or 
devitalisation through sickness, poison, shock, 
ete. Such conditions will render normal exer- 
tions fatighidg.

muscles are not called into any activity of ac- 
count. Simple inhibition of movement, however, 
is a considerable strain and calls the muscles into 
play just as does more expressive action.*2 The 
more active innervations and motor attitudes, 
their constant changing and shifting as the 
series of ideas change, the motor diffusions, and 
the like also deplete motor energy to a consider- 
able extent.

Attention must be considered from two points 
of view, (1) the sensory or ideal and (2) the 
motor or physiological. Without the other, 
either is more or less empty and meaningless. 
The result of the sensorimotor control is dis- 
tinctness and clearness within the given field. 
Considering these aspects, we may define atten-

CHAPTER VI 
THE MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 
§ I. DESCRIPTION 
On its motor side, interest is essentially a 
striving, a conation, an appetition, a tendency 
towards something. An attitude is taken towards 
a situation, an impulsion is felt, a desire to come 
into closer relationship with an object is present. 
Between the subject and the object there is an 
unrealised condition felt in its motor aspect as 
a strain, a stress, a moment of tendency towards 
further control. One is interested, for example, 
in some object in a show window, a tennis racket, 
book, or what not. One feels, or has, or takes an 
interest in the object. The ‘feel’ of the interest, 
its existence as a psychological fact is dependent 
upon the motor attitude which the object in ques- 
tion calls forth. Motor tendencies or incipient 
movements are excited by the object, a general 
attitude towards it is taken, a certain anticipa- 
tion is aroused. This attitude may be felt as a 
183 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
184 ATTENTION AND INTSREST 
general restlessness, a motor ‘set,’ or at times as 
a general thrill. If further contact with the 
stimulating object is possible, this motor atti- 
tude may become more explicit in a series of 
actual movements and manipulations. The in- 
terest which a child shows for a toy emphasises 
this motor aspect. With young children who 
have less control over their actions there are 
movements of the hands, face and body. Some- 
times there are little cries of glee or other expres- 
sions to indicate the direction which the interest 
has taken. When the object is under the child’s 
control the motor tendencies become more or less 
manifest in a number of actions, manipulations, 
and attempts at control of the object. 
Where interest is felt in some idea] situation, 
as in a story, a problem, etc., the motor tenden- 
cies are not so evident. Over and above the atti- 
tude which gives meaning to the situation in the 
center of attention are those tendencies which 
impel one to hurry on to the end, to reach the 
climax, to work out the solution, to facilitate 
fuller control of the object in question, and the 
like. Sometimes the motor attitude becomes so 
strong that it overrides normal realisation and 
seeks to avoid the more gradual control which 
will lead to the desired end. The individual will 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 185 
then turn to the end of the book to see how the 
story ends, or will go to a ‘Key’ to find the solu- 
tion of his problem, or will seek others to get 
further information and help. 
The motor aspect of interest is essentially tele- 
ological, end-seeking. It points ahead and to 
the future. One feels interest in a situation in 
that the situation excites innervations and ten- 
dencies, which, when more fully realised, will 
bring about a condition of pleasure, ease, satis- 
faction, and the like. / A child has an interest 
in a toy, for example, and realises that interest 
when his manipulations and control bring about 
a condition of rest, ease, satisfaction, or pleasure,/ 
In so far as the future moment is realised will 
the interest continue. Should there be a check 
or disappointment, the interest will wane. Thus, 
the child may find the toy not to his liking, or 
perhaps painful and dissatisfying. His interest 
in it will then be less intense upon another occa- 
sion. Even if the object itself is only an indirect 
means to the realisation of a future moment, it 
will, on that account, impel interest, and excite 
tendencies towards fuller control. A factory 
girl, for example, can hardly be said to have any 
interest in the rolling of cigars, as such. But in 
so far as she gets twenty five cents a hundred, 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
186 ATERU TION AND INTEREST 
will her interest hold in the process to the extent 
of making five or six hundred a day. The pros- 
pective situation impels control of present con- 
ditions, even though these conditions are more 
or less disagreeable. 
| Interest, as thus described, is not a feeling of 
pleasure, ease, satisfaction, quiescence, or what 
not. In themselves, such feelings are passive 
and lack the dynamic aspect characteristic of 
interest. Interest is dynamic, it points ahead, 
it is a form of striving, of motor impulsion, and 
is felt as a conation or motor attitude.) Feeling 
of pleasure, satisfaction, etc., is of a more passive 
nature. As felt it lies enmeshed in the present. 
One who is enjoying the taste of fruit, or the 
fragrance of a flower, or the esthetic satisfaction 
arising from the contemplation of a painting or 
a statue, feels pleasure, and this pleasure exists 
in the present. One may lean back, as it were, 
and absorb it. If such satisfaction or pleasure, 
however, is not present, and is possible only 
through control of some situation in the center 
of attention, an interest in the situation will ex- 
ist and will rouse motor attitudes and tendencies. 
These tendencies are felt as interest and guide 
further manipulation. One may, for example, 
see a picture for sale, and be excited to the extent 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 187 
of asking the price of it, and of making ar- 
rangements to buy it. One does not then lean 
back, but becomes active, or feels impelled so 
to do." 
/ In so far as interest points ahead, it has some 
more or less definite ob ject in view. / Aspects of 
a situation come to have a value to the individual 
to a great extent because of the tendencies and 
attitudes which they are able to arouse. This 
psychological phase of interest must be consid- 
ered in any economic treatment of value. No 
doubt the amount of labor which is put into 
an object will condition, in part, the value which 
such an object possesses. So, too, will the 
amount of the material available, the supply of 
articles at hand, and the like, affect value. An

important aspect, however, in the determination 
of the value of an object, is the motor attitude 
which it is able to arouse, the tendencies to pos- 
sess it which the object can excite, in short, the 
interest which it possesses for the consumer.? 
According to the relation in which an interest- 
exciting situation stands to the individual, we 
may, on the motor side, distinguish at least three 
forms of interest, namely, curiosity, expectation, 
and desire. 
Curiosity, expectation and desire. When a 
situation is partly known and partly unknown, 
the known aspects excite motor tendencies along 
grooves which have been formed by previous ex- 
perience. The known elements may have been 
experienced in a form similar to that in which 
they are in the partially known situation, or they 
may have been combined in a different manner 
or with different situations. They excite an 
attitude which may or may not be fit for the new 
situation. In so far as aspects of the situation 
are not known, they impel innervations and ten- 
dencies towards a further control which will 
dispel the uncertainty which is aroused, and

-P-A-G-E-195
  MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 189 
which will produce a feeling of rest and quies- 
cence. Such attitudes and tendencies are felt 
as interest. 
When a situation is not immediately present 
but is awaited with feelings of strain, tension, 
and sometimes with anxiety, we have the interest 
of expectation. The situation in question is 
more or less fully known, but immediate control 
is not possible because the situation is not 
present. Control can not be realised. Tenden- 
cies to such control, however, are present, and it 
is the attitude taken with reference to the situa- 
tion which is to come which constitutes the basis 
of the interest. Since reaction is impossible, only 
the motor ‘set’ can be present. 
A strong form of interest is conscious desire. 
Not only is there a prospective situation or ter- 
minus to which the individual takes an attitude, 
but, in addition, such attitude stimulates him to 
further effort, and excites tendencies towards a 
control of the present which will lead to the end 
desired. If such means are not actively sought, 
desire may lapse into mere wish. One may wish 
for the pot of gold at the other end of the 
rainbow, for example, but one actively desires 
control of an object, in that one works in the 
present, removes obstacles, seeks aid, and the
-P-A-G-E-196
190 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
like, so as to reach the coveted situation. The 
motor tendencies and innervations which are felt 
to control a present means which will lead to the 
end are felt as desire and constitute the motor 
aspect of the interest. 
A few points of difference between these three 
forms of interest may be noted. Expectation 
and desire both have reference to some prospec- 
tive situation. The former, however, is a more 
passive state. In expectation, realisation is de- 
pendent either upon the activity or lack of 
activity of some one else, or upon external con- 
ditions which seem out of the individual’s control. 
Time, or change in extrinsic conditions, or action 
on the part of another is what separates the in- 
terested person from the state towards which he 
is looking. He ¢an do little on his own account to 
further realisation of the situation which he wants. 
He feels tendencies, however, which are excited 
by the anticipation of this situation, and so feels 
an interest in it. {In active desire, on the other 
hand, means are sought with a view of coming 
into closer contact with the situation desired. 
The individual begins to work out his general

the purpose of realising some prospective mo- 
ment. Curiosity differs from both desire and 
expectation in that the situation which excites 
it is present and under control of the individual 
concerned. In so far as it is partially unknown, 
its full significance remains in doubt. There is, 
however, a definite starting point from which 
further reaction and control may begin. In ex- 
pectation and desire the situation is remote and 
out of the individual’s immediate control.’

Compare the states of mind indicated by the 
following selections from Tennyson: 
How dull it is to pause, to make an end, 
To rust unburnish’d, not to shine in use! 
As tho’ to breathe were life. Life piled on life 
Were all too little, and of one to me 
Little remains: but every hour is saved 
From that eternal silence, something more, 
A bringer of new things: and vile it were 
For some three suns to store and hoard myself, 
And this gray spirit yearning in desire 
To follow knowledge like a sinking star, 
Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his

§ II. DEVELOPMENT 
\The rise of interest is dependent chiefly upon 
two factors, (1) pleasure-pain, etc., and (2) in- 
stinct. When any situation excites pleasure- 
pain, ete., it is a means of stimulating reaction. 
Such pleasure-pain, ete., however, is not the 
interest which it develops. In connection with 
instinctive behavior it affords a basis for the 
development of interest. The process is some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 195 
what as follows: Any situation which excites 
feelings of shock, pleasure, satisfaction, pain, 
and the like, other things being equal, will arouse 
reaction and attention to it.} If such a situation, 
after it has entered the center of the field of 
attention, persists in the focus, and leads to a 
pleasing or satisfying terminus, traces of the 
impressions, reactions, etc., are left in the indi- 
vidual who is attending. As the result of the 
control, residual traces, visual, motor, and the 
like, remain. The situation has then a meaning, 
and, in addition, points to a repetition of the 
terminus which is known to be pleasing or satis- 
fying. When this situation or one like it is 
again before the individual, in addition to in- 
herent impelling powers of its own, it will tend 
to excite an attitude favorable to its persistence 
in the focus of attention. The individual will 
feel impelled to react towards it, to control it, 
to manipulate in the manner which on a former 
occasion resulted in feelings of pleasure, ease, 
satisfaction, quiescence, and the like. The ter- 
minus to which it once led will again be sought. 
In other words, the situation has an interest 
which excites the individual to maintain it in the 
center of attentive control. This interest in an 
attitude over and above any feelings of pleasure 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
196 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
which the situation, as such, may be able to 
excite. 
The following account illustrates to some ex- 
tent this process: 
She was holding objects, looking at them, and pulling 
them about for some moments, before they went to her 
mouth. The pleasure of this handling seemed to be 
in the free movement of the objects (seen and felt at 
the same time), not especially in the touch sensations. 
When this new pleasure was exhausted, things went to 
the mouth as before for the enjoyment of touch.... In 
a few hours the baby was reaching for everything near 
her, and in three days more her desire to lay hold on 
things was the dominant motive of her life. Her grasp- 
ing was still oftener with both hands than one, and was 
. somewhat slow, but always accurate.* 
The child’s desire to get a ‘penny’ for a stick 
of candy, his interest in a toy, and the like, are 
common examples. Until experienced, the candy, 
toy, etc., mean little. But after the child has 
eaten the candy, played with the toy, controlled 
the situation which leads to a pleasing or satisfy- 
ing terminus, the sight of the candy, toy, or what 
not, will excite tendencies to control again the 
object in question. The sight of the object 
alone may rouse pleasure. In addition are the 
‘Shinn, Milicent Washburn, The Biography of a Baby, 142, 143. 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 197 
revived tendencies to play, manipulate, control, 
and the like, which have previously resulted in 
pleasure, etc. At first, instincts and feelings are 
sufficient to impel attention and stimulate motor 
control. After the child has reacted there is the 
resulting residual motor and ideal basis which 
impels and guides further control. The situa- 
tion is now one which has interest. It means for 
the individual the possibility of realising pleas- 
urable, satisfying, quieting feelings, of obtain- 
ing joy, ease, satisfaction, and the like. It will, 
when again presented, excite motor tendencies to 
play, manipulate, handle, ete., and a desire to 
control it because of the terminus to which pre- 
vious control has shown it to lead. Conscious- 
ness of this end need not be present in distinct 
form, but may lie enmeshed in a fringe of 
meaning. 
The motor, visual, tactile, and other impres- 
sions will leave traces strong enough to excite 
interest even when the toy or other object is 
not before the child. The mere mention of the 
object, its name, a picture of it, etc., will excite 
an interest in the individual strong enough to 
impel attempted control. Verbal and motor ex- 
pressions usually show the presence of such in- 
terest. The motor attitude and innervations 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
198 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
which are excited give the feel of interest and 
stamp the object as one which has a value or 
worth. In all this, the feeling of interest should 
not be confused with the more passive feelings 
of ease, satisfaction, pleasure, or quiescence. 
A situation may give rise to pain, dissatisfac- 
tion, unrest, ete. In such a case its repetition will 
also excite interest but of a negative character. 
Motor tendencies will then point away from the 
situation. There will be felt innervations and 
impulses to get away from the disturbing object, 
remove it, destroy it, or do away with it. Thus 
Preyer notes: 
Screaming when water 26° C. was poured over him 
in the bath appeared, a few days after the first experi- 
ment of this sort, even before the bathing, at sight of 
the tub, sponge, and water. Previously, fear had only 
in very rare cases occasioned screaming, now the idea 
of the cold and wet that were to be expected was enough 
to occasion violent screaming.” 
The negative interest which the situation 
arouses is the feeling of these motor tendencies 
to react in a manner ugifavorable to the persist- 
ence of the object in the focus of consciousness. 
As in the more positive cases of interest, experi-

ence is necessary before the full meaning of the 
situation can be appreciated. 
| Primary, secondary and acquired interest. 
Such interest as is excited by the object itself 
because of the terminus to which it leads di- 
rectly may be called a primary interest. In pri- 
mary interest the object itself is desired and 
fuller control of it is attempted because of its 
inherent power to produce pleasurable or sat- 
isfying feelings. / Should the object be more 
remote, should direct control of it be impossible, 
any means which will lead to control of it will 
have an interest in that they excite tendencies 
similar to those roused by the situation itself. 
Thus, if a series of means, a, b, c,... ete., lead 
to A, interest in a, b, c,... ete., will be felt 
because of the connection which they have with 
A. Such interest which is derived from a pri- 
mary interest may be called a secondary interest. 
The nature of secondary interest emphasises 
the difference between a feeling of interest and 
feelings of pleasure-pain, satisfaction, and the 
like. The means, as such, may be highly unpleas- 
ant or even painful and repelling, and still may 
possess a secondary interest because of some 
pleasing or satisfying terminus to which they 
lead. A child, for example, may be impelled 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
re ida {aly i 
Cad 
200 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
to work sums in arithmetic, run errands, or do 
other disagreeable tasks because of the secondary 
interest which such work possesses. In them- 
selves the means may have little impelling power. 
But as connected with an end which has primary 
interest, they are able to excite secondary 
interest. ; 
Secondary interest with means pleasurable or 
painful may be represented in the following 
scheme: Let + indicate means which are pleas- 
ing or satisfying in themselves, and — means 
which are painful or dissatisfying. Both lead to 
a situation, P, which has primary interest. The 
interest in the means is secondary. In both 
cases interest is of a positive character in that it 
leads to a situation which is pleasing or satisfy- 
ing. The following scheme illustrates this posi- 
tive movement: 
agreeable 
S+ttt+ 
> 
“disagreeable 
Negative interest may be represented in a 
similar manner. In this case the means lead 
away from a situation which is repelling and 
which has a negative interest. Interest of such 
a sort may be represented as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 201 
agreeable 
disagreeable 
Comparing positive and negative interests, 
both primary (P) and secondary (§ ) with pleas- 
urable (+) and painful (—) means, we have 
the following scheme: 
Stt+++4+ 
Positive Negative 
The distinctions illustrated by this diagram 
should be clearly kept in mind. Secondary in- 
terest is often confused with negative interest, 
especially in educational theory and practice. 
Interest in a painful means which leads to some- 
thing positive is very different from that in a 
painful means which leads away from a more 
painful situation, at least as far as the terminus 
is concerned. 
If the means are pleasurable and satisfying 
an interest will tend to develop in them as such. 
If the end has sufficient impelling power to hold 
attention to the means and to excite a secondary 
interest in them, continued experience which re- 
sults in pleasure and satisfaction will develop 
an interest in such means. Such interest may 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
202 ATTENTION AND INTEREST | 
be called an acquired interest. Acquired interest 
may be developed even in the case of means 
which at first are repelling and disagreeable. 
Many of our interests in later life are of such a 
character. A child is not born a developed 
mathematician, historian, business man, or what 
not. In fact, attempts to develop him in some 
such specific direction, and to give him practice 
in the necessary technique and routine work, may 
at first entail considerable effort. But as more 
complete control is acquired over means which 
lead to artificial ends, as residual traces allow 
of fuller interpretation, the means come to have 
a value and a worth because of pleasure and 
satisfaction which gradually arise out of their 
control. As the acquired interest grows stronger 
it replaces the artificial end which at first ex- 
cited the secondary interest in the means. Many 
of our scholastic interests have been developed 
in this manner. The mechanical aspects of much 
school work is strengthened by artificial ends be- 
fore the acquired interest is strong enough to 
hold attention to them. Acquired interest is 
like primary interest save that it is the result of 
a secondary interest in the means. Since various 
objects and situations have by social experience 
been found to possess value and worth to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 203 
individual, and since first contact with such ob- 
jects or situations may not yield the pleasure 
and satisfaction which fuller control will bring, 
it is often necessary to overcome the inertia of 
the individual by setting artificial ends and in- 
centives and for the time to make the real situ- 
ations of worth a means to the artificial ends. 
Fuller control will then be developed and the 
acquired interest formed. 
If possible, acquired interests should be de- 
veloped from secondary interests of a positive 
character. If negative interest is used there is 
danger that the negative aspect may be associ- 
ated with the means and remain fixed. If these 
means have social worth, the child should be 
attracted rather than repelled by them. Thus, 
a child may do something of a disagreeable na- 
ture to avoid the infliction of pain or the per- 
formance of still more disagreeable tasks. Some 
situation, P, is then used to impel secondary 
interest to disagreeable means, S, which possess 
their interest simply because they are a means 
of avoiding P. This is illustrated by the scheme 
below. 
> 
In such a case there is little chance that an 
acquired interest will be developed in the means. 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
204 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
The whole process, control of means and thought 
of threatened end, is disagreeable and dissatis- 
fying. The probability is that it will soon be 
forgotten. One who works unwillingly under 
threat of punishment will not be impelled to con- 
tinue such work or to renew old associations 
with it. 
gIv. EXPLANATION 
The motor tendencies, which, as felt, consti- 
tute one part of interest, are the expressive side 
of the sensorimotor unit. The direction in which 
they point is dependent upon the results of 
previous experience. Tendencies of appetition 
towards some situations and of aversion from 
other situations are due to the feelings of pleas- 
ure-pain, satisfaction, dissatisfaction, etc., which 
resulted from previous control. The appetition 
or aversion does not make the situation attrac- 
tive or repelling. The attractive or repelling 
nature of a situation is due to former experience 
which has developed meaning in one or the other 
direction. Representation of the situation will 
then excite the motor tendencies towards or from 
it. The strength of such tendencies and the per- 
sistence with which they continue may be taken 
in part as a measure of the impelling or repelling 
character of the situation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
   MOTOR ASPECT OF INTEREST 205 
From a biological point of view, selection and 
development of some forms of control would be 
practically impossible without such motor ten- 
dencies and attitudes. The gliding about of 
abstract ideas or cold, formal images can not give 
rise to the warmth and moving power of interest. 
Summation of a number can hardly produce what 
one does not possess as such. All impressions 
do not and can not have equal impelling power, 
and if direction and purposive meaning are to 
be given to some in preference to others, use 
and function as determined by motor control 
must be present. If an individual reacted 
equally to all impressions or ideas of sufficient 
vividness to force their way into consciousness, 
he would develop an incoherency of action which 
would injure or destroy him. Even the most 
scatter-brained person must cling to some simple 
interest, must have some tendencies which direct 
his efforts in a more or less specific direction 
when situations of a furthering or hindering na- 
ture arise. Such interests may be primitive and 
immediate but they are ngcessary if the individual 
is not to be anise in chaos and confusion. 
In fact, the vividness and inherent, impelling 
nature of situations which can result only in 
harm must be stamped with a proper value, must 
1 
     
-P-A-G-E-212
206 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
deveiop a negative interest, must excite motor 
tendencies to destroy, or remove, or withdraw 
from the situation. The clang of the bell on the 
street, for example, means one thing, that of 
the bell at home means another, according as 
the motor attitude points one way or the other. 
This purposive character shows the inadequacy 
of those views which consider interest simply as 
pleasure-pain. Many situations of inherent, 
pleasure-pain exciting power may, upon first 
impression, hold attention for a while, but in 
short time, wane and die away; and upon further 
representation, they may fail to excite even a 
faint glimmer of interest. If reaction towards 
such situations shows their useless or perhaps 
harmful nature, their passive and superficial 
pleasure-pain aspects are passed by or ignored. 
They will then lack interest in spite of their 
inherent, impelling nature. This dynamic dif- 
ference beween pleasure-pain and interest ac- 
counts also for the intense interest which may be 
excited by objects of an apparently commonplace 
or even repelling character. Objects may lack 
the surface qualities which attract and first con- 
tact with them may yield but little pleasure, may, 
in fact, be repelling or painful. Were interest 
simply a feeling of pleasure-pain, etc., such ob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
IDEAL ASPECT OF INTEREST 207 
jects would not be able, as they are, to excite a 
positive interest. It is the use to which such 
objects can be put, the service which they are 
able to yield, the pleasure or satisfaction to which 
they lead, which determines the interest in them. 
When present, they excite motor tendencies to 
react in the manner which on previous occasions 
resulted in pleasure or satisfaction. Since the 
interest may be present as soon as the object is 
cognised, and since no pleasure can result until 
motor control has been realised, the two, pleasure 
and interest, can hardly be the same. Interest 
is developed on the bases of pleasure, etc., and 
instinct, but it is neither of these. A common 
example is interest in a book, or a golf-stick, or 
a packing case, or a time-table, etc., which, pre- 
vious to fuller control, are more or less indiffer- 
ent as far as pleasure-pain is concerned. 
Reaction at first may, in fact, have been of a 
purely instinctive character.® 
* Much of the discussion of the motor and physiological aspects 
of attention apply to interest. Discussion of these would simply 
be unnecessary duplication. See Chapter III, 2, and Chapter IV. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
CHAPTER VII 
THE IDEAL ASPECT OF INTEREST 
§ 1. DESCRIPTION 
In its simplest form, interest on the cognitive 
side consists of a fringe of meaning or perhaps 
a dim awareness of the future moment which is 
to be realised. There need be no distinct image 
or thought of such a future state. The impres- 
sions carry with them, as it were, a wavy, blurred 
outline of what is to come, a kind of iridescent 
halo of possibility. When the interest exists, 
the object is looked at in another light. It means 
more to the individual. It lingers longer in the 
center of the attentive field. More often, how- 
ever, the interesting object or situation excites 
an image or a train of ideas which point to the 
future moment which is to be realised. These 
images or ideas are present at times only as 
fragments, only as piecemeal signs to point the 
way. Sometimes they rise, give motor direction, 
and flit away, leaving only the motor attitude. 
Often only the verbal image is present. A man 
who is gazing intently at a railroad time-table 
may show interest in what, under other circum- 
208 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
‘ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 239 
attention during the day, (2) type sentences, 
problems, experiments, etc., and (8) mention of 
the method to be used in each of the subjects, as, 
development, drill, or what not. The daily plan 
will ensure some degree of unitary simplicity, 
and the term plan some degree of sequential 
simplicity. In addition, the principal of the 
school should confer with the teachers and unify 
the work of the school in the different subjects. 
The emphasis should be about the same in the 
subjects all along the line. Where one class is 
receiving instruction in one phase of arithmetic, 
for example, and another class of the same grade 
is doing work very much different, the pupils of 
these classes will hardly be ready to assimilate 
instruction in the next grade where perhaps an- 
other scheme of instruction is pursued and a 
different emphasis is placed. The daily plan is 
now recognised as a necessity, and its absence as 
an indication of laxity, and generally of ineffi- 
ciency. When the teacher will give helter-skelter 
instruction with intermissions of vituperation, the 
pupils will not be in the best condition to attend 
to the matter before them. Too many points are 
flashed before them, there is no persistent pre- 
sentation of a single topic, and often the things 
which they should not learn are carefully at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
ae 240 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
tendea to, CLs errors, wrong forms, incorrect 
models, ete. The teacher should carefully cut 
up the subject matter into small portions, and 
use every aid possible to make it clear, as, graphic 
outline, illustration, blackboard summary, etc. 
He should hold himself down to the topic at 
hand and should patiently present it in as many 
ways as possible. For this, careful preparation 
is necessary. 
2. QUALITY OF THE IMPRESSION. Sharp, clear, 
and clean-cut presentation should be the general 
rule in teaching. If the blackboard is used, it 
should be washed with ink, or ink and water, to 
ensure a good background. The writing should 
be firm and neat. No children should be allowed 
to write matter which is to be studied or copied 
by the others. Important parts should be written 
in brightly colored chalk, as, orange, yellow, 
green, or red. Emphasis might also be secured 
by underlining or boxing in colored chalk. If 
pencil or pen is to be used, the ink should be free 
from dirt, the pencils long and properly sharp- 
ened. In apeakite, the teacher should be careful 
to enunciate distinctly, and to express himself 
carefully and accurately. A hurried, careless, 
slovenly manner of expression tends to make the 
children careless and inattentive. These direc- 
   
-P-A-G-E-217
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 237 
been made of a few experiments. Thus, in the study 
of the action of gravity, the different tests, as, weight 
of bodies, pendulum, etc., all lead to a similar inference. 
This inference should not be asked for till the whole 
series of experiments has been made. 
Nature study. Let each child plant a seed in a small 
flower pot. Let every pupil handle a flower, or a twig, 
or the fur of an animal, or what not. Urge every pupil 
to bring in specimens, as stones, wood, sceds, ete. Let 
each class have a small space in the school garden for its 
own use. Let each class have one or two boxes filled 
with earth for the same purpose. Take the children on 
excursions to the zoo, the park, the green fields, and the 
streams in the neighborhood. Use pictures only when 
it is impossible to allow the child to handle the objects 
in question. Verbal descriptions are almost worthless. 
If the class is to study rainfall, let the children look out 
of the window. Point out the clouds. Show the direc- 
tion of the wind by hanging a streamer outside. Wait 
for a rainy day if necessary. Reénforce such instruc- 
tion by requiring the pupils to draw what they have 
seen or handled. Let them draw the growing plant in 
color. Let them outline the passage of water through 
its forms, as, river, vapor, clouds, rain, etc. Each pupil 
should be required to do this. 
Grammar. Let each pupil work on type sentences, 
parts of speech, etc. Have every child construct a num- 
ber of sentences like the model. Have him fill in blanks. 
Let him diagram according to model. Call up the class, 
one row at a time, and have each pupil give the kind

of a sentence required, some word used properly, and 
the like. Definition should come last of all. At times 
it is unnecessary. Use the method of multiple sense 
appeal which is suggested in the case of spelling. 
The above directions are by no means complete. 
They are simply suggestive of numerous other 
devices which any teacher can outline. The fol- 
lowing points should be kept in mind: (1) Let 
each child have some object or situation under 
his immediate control. (2) Let each child react 
towards such situation in a sensorimotor manner, 
i.¢., let him visualise it carefully, handle it, de- 
scribe it verbally, etc. (8) Facilitate such con- 
trol by having material ready, lessons carefully 
planned, and so on.

A logical outline should be made, including, (1) 
a series of connected topics, causally arranged, 
(2) references to standard authorities, and (3) 
possible correlations with other subjects in the 
grade. In addition there should be a daily plan 
of the work to be covered during the day. Such 
a plan should be brief, and should have (1) defi- 
nite topics in each subject which is to receive

that the child makes an actual slope, tableland, mountain, 
etc. If the pupil makes a mountain like a stone fence, 
show him that the water will not drain off and form a 
river, but will collect in a lake or swamp. Connect 
such models with the proper names. ‘Thus, tell the 
pupil to make his river sastn slope more, or his Car- 
paTuian Mountains higher, or his Sictzy more trian- 
gular and so on. 
Let each pupil classify the industries, materials used, 
etc. Let him collect labels on cases, cans, etc. Have him 
draw or trace a map and paste on it the different pro- 
ducts. Let him indicate with colored lines the lands 
to which the products go. Have him construct lists and 
outlines of such products, exports, imports, and the like. 
Require him to map out railroad lines, steamship routes, 
etc., and name them, indicating also the cities which are 
railroad centers, ports, etc. Have him construct lists 
of the same. 
Let the pupils study the location and names of cities, 
rivers, etc., in the manner above suggested for spelling. 
Draw an outline map on the blackboard. Mark and 
name the important cities. Let the pupils visualise the 
map and the marks which indicate the cities. Let the 
children copy the outline, etc., on paper. A rough 
draft will do. Rub out the names on the board, leaving 
the marks indicating the cities. Call up the pupils, one 
at a time, and have each child point to the map when 
the name of the city is called out. Let the pupils in 
flour-paste or mucilage with the pulp. Press this on the board

times. Finally, let the words be written two or three 
times each. If the children are tested, it will be found 
that very few will fail. Those who miss should be 
required to write the misspelled words five or ten times 
each. This method can be applied to the memorising of 
lists of any kind, of outlines, of tables in arithmetic, 
etc. It should replace the monotonous concert recitation 
still in evidence in many classrooms. 
Reading. Content. If possible, the meaning of a 
piece should be acted out by each pupil. The child 
should be asked to do what the piece sets forth. He 
should be required to draw out his own interpretation 
of what the selection describes. He should try to con- 
struct the situation according to the directions given. 
In addition, pictures, diagrams, etc., should be shown 
by the teacher. Last of all should come the verbal 
explanation and lecturing still too common in the 
classroom. 
In teaching the meaning and use of words, a similar 
method should be followed by the teacher. In addition, 
the teacher should require the pupils to make some at- 
tempt to use the words in their daily conversation, in 
their compositions, etc. They should be urged to read 
periodicals, papers, etc., for the purpose of finding sen- 
tences which have the words in question. They should 
keep clippings and paste them in blank books. They 
should so construct sentences that the meaning of the 
word is made clear from the context. Such masters of 
style, as Addison, Irving, etc., should be expounded, and 
an analysis of their method of explaining words by

context, should be made by the teacher. Each pupil 
should be required to find other words which will take 
the place of the word selected. In reading, the pupil 
should be required to find other words which will take 
the place of the one before him in the text. 
Reading. Expression. Each pupil should be allowed 
to read. Teach only five or ten pupils at a time and 
give the rest busy work of some kind, as writing of 
spelling words, tables, etc., illustration in color of some 
story, test or examination. In teaching proper expres- 
sion to the group under immediate supervision, repeat 
the word aloud, show the pupil how to shape the lips, 
place the tongue, and the like. Write the more difficult 
words and phrases on the board and let each pupil read 
them. Correct any errors in enunciation or pronunci- 
ation. Give words similar to the ones on the board. 
Show cards on which such words are written, and let 
each child repeat the word as soon as it is shown. Since 
reading involves the rapid expression of visual symbols 
in articulatory terms, the words and sentences should be 
read off at once without the interpolation of explana- 
tions, reasons, or what not. Let each child then read a 
sentence or so from the reader or the blackboard. Stop 
any slovenly expression and call upon the child again if 
he fails to give the proper expression. 
Geography. If the surface of the country is explained 
let each child model a map in clay or papier maché.1 See

it into small pieces. Let it soak over night in water. Have a

CHAPTER IX 
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 
§I. THE GIVEN SITUATION 
It seems almost self-evident that, to be atten- 
tive, the child must have something definite to 
which it can attend. The situation, moreover, 
to which the child is supposed to attend, must be 
controlled in full by the pupil, if attention is to 
be wholly present. This implies (1) that the 
child must be able to react to the object or situa- 
tion in a sensorimotor manner, and (2) that such 
reaction and control must correspond in some 
degree to the character and intent of the situa- 
tion in question. Practical classroom examples 
will further elucidate these truths. 
Arithmetic. In primary work, each child should be 
busy measuring desk, books, paper, etc., under guidance 
of the teacher. Colored paper should be folded, cut, 
measured, and marked by ench child. Each child should 
be asked to measure the rooms at home, to count the 
windows in the classroom, to find out by his own efforts 
how many feet or inches high he is, and the like. In 
231 
 
-P-A-G-E-224

number drill, each child bhohld be given a chance to 
recite individually. The children should be called up in 
rows, and each one should be rapidly asked the answer 
of a problem of the type given. Written work on 
type problems and examples might be required. In 
spatial measurements, space should be measured, and 
not verbal descriptions given by the teacher. In 
counting, actual concrete series should be counted, 
and not barren, meaningless, verbal symbols. In inter- 
mediate and grammar grade instruction, a similar policy 
should be followed with greater emphasis on the abstract 
aspects of the problems. Thus, explanation of problems 
which involve spatial measurements, necessitates con- 
struction of rooms, fields, etc., in paper, measurements 
worked out on such paper, ete. Fractions should be 
taught by having each pupil break up unitary wholes 
into equal parts. Drill on such work requires the solution 
of a number of problems by the pupils. Such problems 
should be of the type explained. The visual presentation 
on the blackboard is good, but it neglects the motor 
phase of attention. 
Spelling. In writing, one sees the words as one writes 
them. Spelling should therefore be taught with em- 
phasis upon the visual and the motor. Write ten or 
fifteen words on the board, in columns of five or ten. 
Let the children write them on paper. Then require 
the pupils to look at the words, look again with emphasis 
on difficult combinations of letters, close their eyes and 
try to see the words. Do this once or twice. Have them 
repeat the spelling of the words out loud, three or four

In the more advanced stages of development, 
interest and attention run together, but at first, 
attention is somewhat in the lead. Conditions 
other than interest are able to impel attention. 
Thus, intensity of impression and feelings of 
pleasure-pain can excite primary or instinctive 
attention. Interest is not then in evidence. But 
if such instinctive attention results in pleasure, 
ease, satisfaction, and the like, it lays a basis of 
interest in such a situation. When the situation

been made of a few experiments. Thus, in the study 
of the action of gravity, the different tests, as, weight 
of bodies, pendulum, etc., all lead to a similar inference. 
This inference should not be asked for till the whole 
series of experiments has been made. 
Nature study. Let each child plant a seed in a small 
flower pot. Let every pupil handle a flower, or a twig, 
or the fur of an animal, or what not. Urge every pupil 
to bring in specimens, as stones, wood, seeds, etc. Let 
each class have a small space in the school garden for its 
own use. Let each class have one or two boxes filled 
with earth for the same purpose. Take the children on 
excursions to the zoo, the park, the green fields, and the 
streams in the neighborhood. Use pictures only when 
it is impossible to allow the child to handle the objects 
in question. Verbal descriptions are almost worthless. 
If the class is to study rainfall, let the children look out 
of the window. Point out the clouds. Show the direc- 
tion of the wind by hanging a streamer outside. Wait 
for a rainy day if necessary. Reénforce such instruc- 
tion by requiring the pupils to draw what they have 
seen or handled. Let them draw the growing plant in 
color. Let them outline the passage of water through 
its forms, as, river, vapor, clouds, rain, ete. Each pupil 
should be required to do this. 
Grammar. Let each pupil work on type sentences, 
parts of speech, etc. Have every child construct a num- 
ber of sentences like the model. Have him fill in blanks. 
Let him diagram according to model. Call up the class, 
one row at a time, and have each pupil give the kind 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
238 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
of a sentence required, some word used properly, and 
the like. Definition should come last of all. At times 
it is unnecessary. Use the method of multiple sense 
appeal which is suggested in the case of spelling. 
The above directions are by no means complete. 
They are simply suggestive of numerous other 
devices which any teacher can outline. The fol- 
lowing points should be kept in mind: (1) Let 
each child have some object or situation under 
his immediate control. (2) Let each child react 
towards such situation in a sensorimotor manner, 
i.e., let him visualise it carefully, handle it, de- 
scribe it verbally, etc. (3) Facilitate such con- 
trol by having material ready, lessons carefully 
planned, and so on. 
§ II. FACILITATION 
1. Suvpricrry. The work in each subject 
should be carefully mapped out by the teacher. 
A logical outline should be made, including, (1) 
a series of connected topics, causally arranged, 
(2) references to standard authorities, and (3) 
possible correlations with other subjects in the 
grade. In addition there should be a daily plan 
of the work to be covered during the day. Such 
a plan should be brief, and should have (1) defi- 
nite topics in each subject which is to receive 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
‘ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 239 
attention during the day, (2) type sentences, 
problems, experiments, etc., and (8) mention of 
the method to be used in each of the subjects, as, 
development, drill, or what not. The daily plan 
will ensure some degree of unitary simplicity, 
and the term plan some degree of sequential 
simplicity. In addition, the principal of the 
school should confer with the teachers and unify 
the work of the school in the different subjects. 
The emphasis should be about the same in the 
subjects all along the line. Where one class is 
receiving instruction in one phase of arithmetic, 
for example, and another class of the same grade 
is doing work very much different, the pupils of 
these classes will hardly be ready to assimilate 
instruction in the next grade where perhaps an- 
other scheme of instruction is pursued and a 
different emphasis is placed. The daily plan is 
now recognised as a necessity, and its absence as 
an indication of laxity, and generally of ineffi- 
ciency. When the teacher will give helter-skelter 
instruction with intermissions of vituperation, the 
pupils will not be in the best condition to attend 
to the matter before them. Too many points are 
flashed before them, there is no persistent pre- 
sentation of a single topic, and often the things 
which they should not learn are carefully at- 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
240 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
tendea to, ¢.g., errors, wrong forms, incorrect 
models, ete. The teacher should carefully cut 
up the subject matter into small portions, and 
use every aid possible to make it clear, as, graphic 
outline, illustration, blackboard summary, etc. 
He should hold himself down to the topic at 
hand and should patiently present it in as many 
ways as possible. For this, careful preparation 
is necessary. 
2. QUALITY OF THE IMPRESSION. Sharp, clear, 
and clean-cut presentation should be the general 
rule in teaching. If the blackboard is used, it 
should be washed with ink, or ink and water, to 
ensure a good background. The writing should 
be firm and neat. No children should be allowed 
to write matter which is to be studied or copied 
by the others. Important parts should be written 
in brightly colored chalk, as, orange, yellow, 
green, or red. Emphasis might also be secured 
by underlining or boxing in colored chalk. If 
pencil or pen is to be used, the ink should be free 
from dirt, the pencils long and properly sharp- 
ened. In speaking, the teacher should be careful 
to enunciate distinctly, and to express himself 
carefully and accurately. A hurried, careless, 
slovenly manner of expression tends to make the 
children careless and inattentive. These direc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 241 
tions may seem trivial and unnecessary, but they 
often make the difference between efficiency and 
inefficiency in some subjects. Note how the 
pupils will look at the board if there is a neatly 
colored outline map upon it, or a carefully 
arranged summary. One can hardly blame a 
pupil for looking out of the window or under 
the desk if he has before him a grey, dusty board, 
or a board hurriedly erased and having upon it 
scraps and fragments of a former presentation 
which did not come fully beneath the board rub- 
ber. The same is true in other aspects of 
instruction. 
3. Tums. Give the pupil time to absorb what 
is being presented. Allow some time, however 
small, for each step in the lesson, from the pre- 
liminary signal to the end of the lesson. Give 
the signal, ‘Ready,’ and see that each pupil is 
ready. Present one topic, and make reasonably 
sure that it has been properly assimilated. Pause 
a moment, and quiz half a dozen pupils, some 
poor, some medium. Do not hurry along, and 
do not rest satisfied if one or two pupils can 
answer. Do not fret and fume if the results of 
the first presentation are poor, if over half the 
class misses, if the per cents range from ten to 
thirty. Give the children time to learn. Present 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
242 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
the same topic again, with perhaps slight addi- 
tions. Take for granted that children learn very 
slowly, that if too much is foreed upon them, 
they become distracted, or coolly indifferent. 
Remember that about one half of the new matter 
presented is forgotten after the first half hour, 
two thirds in nine hours, three quarters after six 
days, and four fifths after a month. Time must 
be taken for development, time for review, and 
time for drill. 
4. PreapsJustMENT. Give some signal, as, 
a tap or a word, to indicate that the lesson is to 
follow. Moreover, see that the signal is obeyed. 
Do not pass from one lesson to another without 
having all the pupils prepared to take up 
the new work. If the one lesson is a writing 
lesson, and the following is a geography or 
a history lesson, give some such directions as 
the following: Pencils down. Pass papers. 
Books away. Take modeling boards. And so 
on. Pause slightly after each direction. See 
that it is followed. If the directions are given 
in sharp, military fashion, and are followed by 
a slight pause, they impel attention and set the 
pupil in a business-like frame of mind. If neces- 
sary, make sure that each pupil is in the proper 
attitude for the new work, by passing rapidly 
  | 
.
-P-A-G-E-249
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 243 
through one or two of the side aisles. If the 
teacher is satisfied to talk ahead with a large 
percentage of the children playing under the 
desk, writing, finishing up the previous lesson, 
and the like, much of his work will be wasted as 
far as the attention of the pupils is concerned. 
Fixation should be facilitated by having a defi- 
nite model before the pupils, by calling their 
attention to specific aspects of it, by pointing to 
the parts which are essential, and so on. A series 
of rapid questions will aid in holding the children 
in the attitude of attention. Note the external 
signs of preadjustment, as, head erect, eyes look- 
ing at the object before them, body leaning 
slightly forward, etc. Do not continue the 
lesson if the majority of the pupils are not in 
the right attitude of fixation. 
5. IDEAL REINFORCEMENT. Have the black- 
board covered with work as soon as the pupils 
enter the room. Examples in arithmetic or 
grammar, a colored map, colored designs in 
drawing, spelling list, ete., should be on the 
board before the pupils come. This work should 
be connected with the lessons of the day. Home 
work, on the other hand, should not be given till 
the close of the day. Pupils can not be expected 
to attend so closely to the lessons of the day if 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
| 
| ' 
244 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
they are thinking of problems, ete., to be done 
at home. Often pupils will be found surrepti- 
tiously doing such home ran wader the desk. 
In the course of instruction, use the experiences 
of the child and the objects of the immediate 
environment in making clear the topics of the 
lesson. The streams in the gutters, the lake in 
the park, the stones of the school or other build- 
ings, the clothes worn by the children, the foods 
which they eat, the labels and marks on manu- 
factured articles, ete., should be used as examples 
in the presentation of topics 1 geography, etc. 
The words in spelling should be selected from 
the exercises in reading, from the expressions 
used in arithmetic and grammar, from the les- 
sons in geography and history, from the vocabu- 
lary which the children ought to have, ete. Such 
lists should be revised each term. Composition 
should be based on work of the term which has 
been already covered, on experiences of the chil- 
dren, on activities which are within the child’s 
understanding and which are taking place under 
his eyes, and the like. The teacher should try to 
find the mental background which will best 
serve to hold the topic in the focus of attention, 
which will best enable the presentation to per- 
sist. New topics which have Title connection 
   
-P-A-G-E-251
  ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 245 
with the experiences or the environments of the 
children will have little chance to continue in the 
centre of the attentive field. 
6. Practice. Practice is necessary to enable 
ideal backgrounds to persist, and to make 
habitual the motor codrdinations and adjust- 
ments which are necessary in attention. The rate 
of forgetting? is so rapid that constant drill is 
necessary. The rules for drill are as follows: 
(1) Present one topic. Allow for review by 
giving a few types of the kind already pre- 
sented, but let the body of the lesson deal with 
the topic which is to be drilled upon. (2) Secure 
repetition. Let every pupil recite. Call the 
class up in rows and have each child answer. 
Give a number of problems or examples of the 
same kind, and let the children work them. Let 
the children use blank maps and fill in railroad 
centres one day, industries another, etc., connect- 
ing one with the other. Present similar topics 
in a series of lessons. Check the problems or 
types on which most of the children fail, and give 
them again. Use the method of multiple sense 
appeal in fastening essential facts in the differ- 
ent subjects. (3) See that such repetition is 
?See Myers, C. S., 4 Tewxt-Book of Experimental Psychology, 
Ch, XIII.

246 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
properly distributed. If the children do not - 
seem able to grasp the point of the lesson at the 
end of half an hour, do not lied for an hour 
or two more. Simplify the work still more, wait 
for a day or two and try again. Give intermis- 
sions so that the children can rest. If two hours 
are to be spent on some topic, divide the time 
into half or three-quarter hour periods and 
spread them pver several days. (4) There should 
be a mass of material at hand, and such material 
should deal with the same topic. The blackboard 
should be covered with work. Numerous speci- 
mens should be on hand. Copies of designs 
should be ready for distribution. Whatever be 
the subject, the teacher should see that sufficient 
material is ready for illustration, use, or what 
not. No teacher should be satisfied to ‘know 
about what he is going to teach,’ or to ‘carry the 
day’s work in his head.’ (5) Appeal to each 
pupil through as many of the senses as possible. 
Let the children visualise, articulate, express 
themselves manually, listen to the presentation 
or explanation, etc. Let each sensory impres- 
sion be followed by some form of motor ex- 
pression. Let the children do many examples. 
‘Let them draw or model many maps. Let them 
answer in composition form when writing on 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 247 
historical or geographical topics. Let them 
synopsise and expand stories which have been 
illustrated, read, and explained. The teacher 
should plan work to fit the different senses, and 
such appeals should deal with the same topics.* 
7. FavicUE AND PAusE. So that the children 
should not be unnecessarily fatigued by the day’s 
work, some consideration should be given to the 
order in which the subjects are presented. Con- 
struction of a proper daily schedule involves (1) 
the physiological rhythm to which the child is 
subject, (2) the relative difficulty of the sub- 
jects, (8) the length of the period during which 
instruction is to continue, (4) the distribution 
of periods over the days of the week, (5) the 
days of the week most favorable to work, (6) 
the age and maturity of the children, and (7) 
general factors, as, the weather, the rhythm of 
energy during the months of the year, etc. 
(a) Daily rhythm. The periods of the day 
most favorable to work are the former half of 
the morning and the latter half of the afternoon. 
The morning period again is better than the 
afternoon period. The best period of the day 
is from nine to eleven in the forenoon. The 
*See Arnold, F., Teat-book of School and Class Management, 
1:Ch. V, § III, 3. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
| 
248 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
The end of the morning session and the begin- 
ning of the afternoon session are most unfav- 
orable to heavy work.* 
(b) Relative difficulty of subjects. In the 
order given, the following subjects put the chil- 
dren to the greatest strain: (1) exercises which 
involve muscular effort, as gymnastics, (2) ab- 
stract and formal subjects, as arithmetic, gram- 
mar, etc., and (3) thought work and exercises 
which involve the memory. The kinds of work 
which require less energy are, (1) manual work, 
as drawing, construction, etc, (2) oral work, 
and (8) work which involves content and objec- 
tive phases rather than formal, as geography, 
history, literature, ete. No subject which puts 
the child to a special strain should be given at 
the end of the morning or the beginning of the 
afternoon, and no two such subjects should fol- 
low each other. | 
(c) Length of periods. The length of a les- 
son should vary between fifteen minutes and an 
hour or so. Subjects which require less energy 
should be given longer periods than subjects 
which are more difficult. Forty minutes is con- second best period is after two : the afternoon.

-P-A-G-E-255
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 249 
sidered a normal period for older children, and 
fifteen or twenty minutes one for younger chil- 
dren. A succession of short periods should be 
avoided if possible, as this tends to give a 
choppy effect to the day’s work and to produce 
restlessness. 
(d) Difference in days. Monday and Friday 
are not so good as the other days of the week. 
Less difficult subjects should be given on these 
days. Days which immediately precede or fol- 
low holidays, ete., are also not good for difficult 
work. 
(e) Maturity of the children. The age and 
maturity of the children will condition the length 
of the periods, the number of intermissions for 
physical exercise, the length of time for recess, 
and the general method of instruction which is 
to be followed. There should be a two-minute 
setting-up exercise at the end of each lesson. 
For younger children, there should be a ten or 
fifteen minute period for play and exercise at 
about half-past ten, and a similar period after 
two. Primary periods of instruction should run 
from fifteen minutes to half or three quarters of 
an hour. Grammar or intermediate periods 
should vary between three quarters of an hour 
and an hour and a half, 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
250 ATTENTION AND INTEREST, 
(f) Weather influences. Sultry days and hot 
days are not favorable to heavy work. The 
beginning of a snow storm 
restless. Days which are cold and clear are fav- 
orable to good work. On unfpyorable days the 
teacher should not take up advance work in the 
difficult subjects. He should review, drill upon, 
or test old work, give written exercises, etc. 
Extra effort should be put forth on such days. 
(g) Seasonal rhythm. The best work can 
be done during the period from December to 
April. The heaviest work should therefore be 
done during the last two months of the first term 
and the first two months of the second term. 
During the months of June, July, and August, 
and to a certain extent during the spring months 
the children show greater excitement and more 
numerous tendencies to irresponsible action. 
Crimes, popular outbursts, riots, revolutions, 
etc., usually break out during the Spring and 
Summer months.’ 
8. HUNGER AND UNDERFEEDING. Where un- 
derfeeding is evident, i.e., where children are 
underweight, not so much should be expected of 
5See Hall, G. S., Adolescence, 2: 47. Leffingwell, Albert, In- 
fluence of Seasons upon Conduct. See also Arnold, F., Sch. and 
Cl. Man., 2:Ch. I, § IV, 4. 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 251 
them. If possible underfed or improperly fed 
children should be given a glass of milk and a 
biscuit or roll in the morning, at twelve, and at 
the close of the day. Such food should be given 
at cost price. From a nutritive point of view 
soup is not worth much. As Barr points out, 
‘statistics show that 10 ounces of bread and 1 
pint of skimmed milk equal in nutriment a diet 
composed of 8 ounces of soup, 2 ounces of beef, 
2 ounces of potatoes, 1 ounce of turnips, 4 
ounces of bread, 1% ounce of butter, and 1 cup 
of coffee containing 1 ounce of milk and 4 
ounce of sugar.” 
9. OpstRUcTED BREATHING. If the child 
shows signs of obstructed breathing, he should 
be examined and sent to the school physician. 
The teacher should also see that the room is 
properly ventilated 
10. WEAK MINDEDNESS. Instruction of weak 
minded children should use concrete means of 
presentation in all the subjects. Arithmetic 
should be taught by means of scissor work, paper 
folding, colored blocks, ete. Processes should 
be simple and should, if necessary, be reduced 
to counting. Counting, in fact, should be used 
to test the more difficult processes. In language 
° Barr, M. W., Mental Defectives, 170. 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
252 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
work, pictures, illustrations, dramatisations, 
social activities, modeling in sand, construction 
work, ete., should be made the basis of oral and 
written composition, spelling, ete. Only one 
simple topic in any subject should be presented 
at a time. Lesson periods should be very short. 
They may vary between ten minutes and an 
hour. There should be intermissions in which 
games are played, social activities conducted, 
‘make-believe’ occupations carried on, and the 
like. The surroundings of the children should 
be used as a basis of these different activities. 
11. ExtTRANEOUS STIMULATION. As soon as 
the pupil enters the room he should see on the 
blackboard a general outline of the work of the 
day. Examples, map, etc., should be on the 
board. During the lesson the teacher should 
see that only such material as is necessary 
for the work is under the pupil’s immediate con- 
trol. The lesson should run on without inter- 
ruptions. There should be no halts due to 
missing pencils or pens, empty ink wells, ete. 
Before the work of the day begins, the teacher 
or a monitor should arrange such supplies as 
will be needed during the day. The room should 
be tidy. Whatever decorations are used, they 
should be neatly placed. There should be a gen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  ATTENTION IN THE CLASSROOM 253 
eral cleaning-up at least once a week. Loose 
paper, material, etc. should not lie on the win- 
dow sills, or desks. The directions given above 
for preadjustment will be found useful in shut- 
ting out sources of extraneous stimulation.”

Maxwell, New York, J. H. van Sickle, Baltimore, and the Child 
Study Reports of F. W. Smedley, D. P. MacMillan, and F. G. 
Bruner, Chicago. A similar point of view has been worked out 
by W. E. Grady, in ‘Pragmatic Concepts, and the Educational 
Process,’ New York. The above chapter will probably be further 
amplified as portion of a volume on general method in instruction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
   CHAPTER 
INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM 
| 
g1. POSITIVE VERSUS NEGATIVE INTEREST 
There is nothing very mysterious or uncanny 
in the development of interest in the classroom. 
In its simplest terms, the problem is somewhat 
as follows: Arrange the instruction and disci- 
pline in such a manner that whatever the pupil 
does ends in pleasure, satisfaction, ease, Or 
quiescence. If the activity itself does not so end, 
then produce pleasure, satisfaction, ease, or 
quiescence by artificial means. It is a mistaken 
idea that the child should do his work at school 
merely because the teacher says so, or that some 
high and mighty virtue should impel him to do 
the work. The teacher himself asks for some 
recompense, and we. find very few individuals 
who will put forth continued effort on the mere 
say-so of another. The aim of the work in part 
is the development of obedience to authority, of 
respect for the true, the good, and the beautiful, 
etc., but the realisation of this aim ealls for 
laborious effort on the part of the teacher. 
Many of us, in spite 7 big if orts of the school, 
     
-P-A-G-E-261
  INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM — 255 
are still painfully lacking in many of the virtues 
which we too readily take for granted in the 
child. We must begin from lower levels, and 
appeal to bases, which, from a more advanced 
stage, might seem somewhat crass and selfish. 
If the work itself does not end in pleasure, 
satisfaction, ete., and if the teacher does not use 
artificial means to secure a pleasurable or satis- 
fying result, then the work becomes a drudgery 
which is done to avoid some greater evil, as, de- 
tention, nagging, corporal punishment, and the 
like. The principal, the parent, the truant offi- 
cer, and the police court are then called into 
service to browbeat parent and child, and by 
threat of fine or imprisonment, to coerce the child 
to attend to his work at school. Many cases of 
truancy will always be found, no matter what 
the school can do either positively or negatively. 
But the artificial conditions which exist, in which 
the children consider the school somewhat as a 
necessary evil, would hardly be found if the 
school made a systematic attempt to use positive 
instead of negative interest. There is no inher- 
ent virtue in doing a task because the completion 
of such a task will relieve the child from coercion, 
punishment, or what not. By association the 
child will not be led to care for the work. If the 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
256 ATTENTION AND ID 
task itself is disagreeable, it will have little power 
of its own to impel the child to continue it, or to 
attempt it again. No matter how necessary the 
work may be, if the child dow! not see the neces- 
sity of it, and if the efforts put forth lead to 
nothing positive in the way of pleasure, ease, 
satisfaction, etc., the pupil will not feel impelled 
to strive along similar lines. 
Where the children have proper homes, and 
parents who are interested in their welfare, 
much of such satisfaction, pleasure, etc., as is 
needed in the development of interest, is obtained 
from relatives, and friends who look after the 
child. But where the children do not have such 
congenial surroundings, where families of four 
or five live in two or three rooms, where the boys 
and girls roam the streets as preferable to close 
and stuffy rooms, the home can not be depended 
upon to support the school in the development 
of interest in school studies. If the school does 
not use positive means of developing interest, 
such negative means as beating, detention at 
court or truant school, ete. are called upon 
properly to subdue the children. 
The use of positive means does not preclude 
earnest effort, or hard work. The point is not 
that the work should be made easy, or that every- 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM — 257 
thing which is done in the classroom should be 
pleasurable, but that whatever is done by the 
children, no matter how difficult or disagreeable, 
should end in feelings of pleasure or satisfaction. 
Children will be found the last to shirk hard work 
which leads to a satisfying or pleasurable ter- 
minus. In this sense interest does not conflict 
with effort, but rather is a means of calling forth 
the greatest amount of effort. 
gII. APPROVAL AND DISAPPROVAL 
1. Exnisition of work. When the child has 
put forth effort on written or similar work, it 
should be hung up on the walls of the classroom, 
if only for a short time. The teacher should 
arrange picture wire, burlap, cardboard, etc., so 
that arithmetic papers, drawings, construction 
work, and the like can be exhibited. If the child 
sees that his efforts are thus appreciated, he will 
feel satisfied and pleased, and will strive all the 
more on following occasions. If his work is not 
quite what it ought to be, refusal to hang it up 
will have the effect of disapproval. Every 
means of approval which the teacher uses can 
thus become a means of disapproval. 
2. CommEnDaTION. The teacher should not 
hesitate to praise good work whenever he sees it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
258 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
Ha 
He should hold up a good pap cr before the class 
and publicly approve the chil | who has done it. 
such expressions as ‘Good,’ ‘Very fine, “Ex- 
cellent,’ and the like should be used again and 
again. A child will feel impelled to work harder 
if he sees that his efforts receive recognition. 
On the other hand, continual faultfinding, vitu- 
peration, and nagging will discourage him, and 
finally make him indifferent and callous. 
3. Marx. Most of the written work of the 
pupils, as drawings, compositions, test papers, 
etc., should be marked by either the teacher or a 
pupil, and returned to the children. If any 
papers are thrown away, they should not be 
destroyed in the presence of the children. Cred- 
its might be given for neatness, high per cents, 
ete. Weekly or monthly ratings in four or five 
groups of subjects should be posted where all 
the children can see them. Honor rolls, gold- 
star charts, ete., are some of the devices by which 
attention can be called to special merit. If the 
work is not quite up to the mark, withholding of 
approval will act as disapproval. Demerits 
might also be given to check careless work.

INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM 259 
g III. SELF-ACTIVITY 
Wherever possible the child himself should be 
allowed to do the work demanded by the lesson. 
Let the pupil fold paper to illustrate fractions, 
or arrange splints in groups for counting, or cut 
out cardboard to illustrate surface measurement 
of a room, etc. Let him model a map in clay 
or papier maché, cut it out in colored paper, draw 
and color it, fill in cities, rivers, ete., paste on 
samples of products, form lists and outlines, and 
the like. Let him give sentences in grammar, 
fill in blanks with the proper forms, diagram, 
etc. Let him construct apparatus for experi- 
ments in science, bring in specimens for nature 
study, and so on. In addition, cap his efforts 
with, pleasure and satisfaction by publicly prais- 
ing his work, exhibiting it, marking it, and the 
like. Do not force him to sit quiet doing noth- 
ing, while words, words, words, are being show- 
ered upon him. The least thing which will 
relieve the children from the too common verbi- 
age of the classroom will stimulate and excite 
them to put forth effort. 
giv. IMITATION 
To guide the self-activity of the children 
along definite channels, models should be shown 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
260 ATTENTION AND INTEREST 
them. The best model or copy to stimulate the 
activity of the children is an actual, concrete 
situation, of the kind which they are to manipu- 
late. Let them count real money, or paper 
money. Let them buy and sell as men buy and 
sell outside of the school, with a pupil as store- 
keeper, and other children as customers. Let 
the pupils measure the walls of the classroom, 
estimate the number of square feet in the surface 
of the walls, etc. Bring in real leaves and flow- 
ers for design work. Let the children handle and 
test the kinds of stone, wood, fur, cloths, etc., 
which form the subject matter for geography, 
nature study, or other lessons. If it is not pos- 
sible to present concrete situations, use the next- 
best means of presentation, as, colored illustra- 
tions or photographs, diagrams, outlines, and 
the like. Magazines now reproduce in color 
many interesting views, and each teacher can 
readily collect a number of such views. Pupils, 
too, can be asked to get such pictures. History, 
geography, literature, reading, etc., will acquire 
fresh interest by such means. 
For review or drill, as in arithmetic or gram- 
mar, a problem should be written on. the black- 
board and its solution indicated below. In 
addition, the teacher should work out the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-267
  INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM — 261 
problem, step by step, in the presence of the chil- 
dren. They should then be set to work a number 
of similar problems. The children who work most 
neatly and correctly should be commended, and 
their papers should be exhibited. Interest in 
most of such drill work will be of a secondary 
nature. No doubt the children have some natural 
interest in number work as such, but this is 
rather flitting and unreliable. To ensure the 
regularity and persistence which are necessary 
in drill work, secondary interest must be em- 
ployed. The same holds for other subjects, as, 
grammar, spelling, and the like. 
§V. MULTIPLE SENSE APPEAL 
In the presentation of a new lesson and in 
drill on an old one, appeals should be made to 
as many of the senses as possible. The pupil 
should see pictures, maps, outlines, models, etc. 
He should be allowed to visualise them for a 
definite period. Essential aspects should be 
pointed out to him, and he should be urged to 
look, close his eyes, revive the impression, and 
look again to see how correctly he has repro- 
duced the visual presentation. He should then 
model, draw, write, etc. Oral expression might 
be required. After the sensory appeals have 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
“262 ATTENTION AND i 
been made, the pupils might be required to ex- 
press themselves in composition form either 
orally or in writing. Commendation, exhibition 
of work, ete., will increase whatever satsfaction 
or pleasure the work itself has produced. 
§ VI. INTEREST AND THE CURRICULUM 
Experimental tests and empirical observation 
in the classroom will show that pupils differ in 
natural ability and talent. Some will be found 
strong in one group of subjects, others in an- 
other group of subjects. Pupils will differ in 
their ability in the same subject. A pupil who 
is good in division, is not necessarily good in 
addition or multiplication. One good in gram- 
mar or composition may be found weak in spell- 
ing or reading. We should not strive, therefore,   
to do the impossible, to level all differences, and 
to create an equal interest in all the subjects in 
all pupils. 
minimum requirements in such 
required by society at large, a 
pupils to develop their mata 
special lines. By approval, g The most we can do is to ask for 
subjects as are 
d to allow the 
talents along 
idance of self- 
activity, presentation of the proper models, etc., 
we can stimulate pupils to exert effort in all the 
subjects to a minimum degree, and in special 
   
-P-A-G-E-269
  INTEREST IN THE CLASSROOM — 263 
subjects to a maximum degree. The minimum 
should be the same for all pupils, but the maxi- 
mum will differ according to the ability and 
inclination of the special pupil concerned. Clas- 
sification and promotion should not be based on 
an average, but on minimum proficiency in most 
of the subjects, and greater proficiency in one or 
two in which the pupil shows greatest interest. 
The problem of the teacher is to develop 
natural tendencies into definite interests. The 
bases to which he must appeal are the instincts 
and feelings of the child. Appeal to the child’s 
interest is possible only after some interest has 
been already developed. The child does not come es 
with interests ready-made to which appeal can 
be made. Rather, he comes with blind and in- 
choate tendencies, wild strivings, formless in- 
stincts, which the teacher must direct and shape. 
By presentation of models, by guidance of the 
child’s self-activity, by capping his efforts with 
satisfaction, the teacher fashions the instincts of 
the pupil, shows him that his efforts are worth 
while, and develops interests which can be of 
service in the direction of further effort.*

  FELIX ARNOLD’S 
Text Book of School and Class 
Management Cloth r2 mo., $1.95 net. 
“The book enters into every detail and every phase of school 
instruction and management and points out in kindly fashion 
the immense importance of a proper co-operation between prin- 
cipals and teachers in instruction, discipline and supervision. 
When it comes to consideration of the child it enters upon a 
deep psychological study and analysis, citing the different influ- 
ences operating upon the mind of the young and its inherent 
attributes, discussing the nature of conduct, the different tem- 
peramental traits of the child, the promotion of obedience, 
ambition and class spirit, vices and their best modes of correc- 
tion. The author closes his book with this wise admonition: 
‘We complain of the conduct of the children in the school; we 
cry out against their behaviour out of school, yet we send them 
forth like Noah’s dove, without a light to guide them or a sup- 
port on which they can rest. The school should do its part in 
giving the child right ideals, proper habits and a firm moral 
basis which will enable him to pass judgment on his actions. 
The problem is one which can not be ignored.’” 
—San Francisco Chronicle. 
“ ‘School and Class Management’ is the best work on the sub- 
ject that I have ever read. Every teacher should study it and 
to every principal it will afford profitable reading.” 
—J. M. Wittarp, Principal of Philadelphia N. S. for Girls. 
“I believe the book is one that should be in the library of 
every principal. Its treatment of the relation of principal and 
teachers, the duties of principal and the treatment of conduct 
as given in this book are such as to impel one’s interest and 
can not but be read with profit. It seems to me that the book 
should have a place in training class work.” 
—Mr. J. W. Reep, Principal High School, Dansville, N. Y. 
“Tt is a most comprehensive work, teeming with practical 
suggestions toward character-building and doing right for right’s 
sake. It shows deep reading on the part of the author. It 
shows more, a deep sympathy for children, for whom no con- 
scientious teacher feels that he can do enough. It shows ways 
and means leading to cheerful obedience on the part of a pupil 
to a teacher whose every word and action bespeak his love for 
the little ones.”

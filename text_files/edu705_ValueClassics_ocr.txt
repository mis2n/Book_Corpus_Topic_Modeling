PREFACE 
In education definite evidence is worth more than 
theorizing. ‘This book is chiefly an appeal to facts, and 
two classes of facts appear in its pages. 
The first includes the testimony contained in ad- 
dresses given at the Conference and in the statements 
of nearly three hundred competent observers represent- 
ing the leading interests of modern life and including 
many of the highest names in our land. Four Presi- 
dents of the United States head the distinguished list. 
To make sure the evidence is as free from professional 
bias as is practicable, the teachers of the classics have 
been excluded except in the few cases where they hap- 
pen to be the heads or authorized representatives of in- 
stitutions and are thus entitled to speak for them. The 
statements are chiefly American, supplemented by a 
few important declarations from England and France. 
This testimony, with only occasional variation in its 
degree of conviction or of emphasis on one or another 
factor, converges steadily to one main conclusion, name- 
ly, that classical studies are of essential value in the best 
type of liberal education and that whenever the classics 
are well taught the results are satisfactory. 
The second part is statistical. The most pertinent 
and reliable facts in the records of our schools and col- 
leges, so far as procurable, are here presented and ex- 
amined. They reveal the general and decided superi- 
ority of classical over non-classical students in the chief 
%,  
-P-A-G-E-6

school studies and in college studies also. They also 
reveal the complete inaccuracy of recent assertions that 
the classics are poorly taught in comparison with other 
subjects. 
Apart from a relatively small number of testimonies, 
all the material has been very recently prepared espe- 
cially for this book. It is therefore a fresh contribution 
of original value for all who care to know on what sort 
of evidence the case for the classics rests both in the 
records of our schools and colleges and in the judgment 
of many men of many minds who speak from knowledge 
born of experience and enhanced in value by their gen- 
eral agreement. It is not the evidence of mere tradi- 
_ tion, but of newly proved success. 
The book had to be prepared in a short time. It was 
therefore impossible to treat the subject exhaustively. 
With longer time it would have been easy to fill several 
volumes with added testimonies and records of value 
from all parts of our country. Yet enough is printed 
here to furnish the most important, timely and repre- 
sentative assemblage of testimonies and records on this 
subject which has ever been presented to the American 
public. 
Hearty acknowledgment, even if only of a general 
sort, is here due to all whose quick and useful help made 
the prompt issuing of this volume an easier task, and 
especially to Arthur Scribner, Frank A. Vanderlip, 
Paul D. Cravath, Philip Rollins and Robert Mc- 
Namara, for their support which made possible the 
Princeton Conference of which this volume is the first 
fruits.

THE PRESENT OUTLOOK 
AN INTRODUCTION 
By Anprew F, West 
Dean of the Graduate School, Princeton University 
For a man to conquer himself is the first and best 
of all victories.

Our new seriousness 
An awakening of what had seemed dormant interest 
in the value of different studies has happened this year. 
It is one of many effects of an underlying cause. The 
entrance of America into the world war, with all its 
excitement, has made us more thoughtful. It has 
raised the imperative question: Why are we fighting? 
And we have answered: Not from lust for gain or 
power, but to save our civilized freedom. We wake to 
find ourselves face to face with the almost perfect 
mechanism of an elaborately organized autocracy, bar- 
baric in spirit, armed with every efficient practical ap- 
pliance and devoid of regard for what we hold most 
dear. It is again a war of “Soul with Sense” and on a 
greater scale than ever before in history. 
To meet it we need something more than the appli- 
ances of our foe. We need the higher powers of the 
human soul; not skill and courage alone, but that guid- 
ing wisdom which is more than craft and which springs 
from undying faith in truth and freedom. It is the re- 
turn in power of these simple convictions which has 
8

sobered American thinking. The invisible things are 
again appearing as real. We are asking ourselves 
whether they are not the only things on which to build 
any life that is to be worth the living. Or are we mis- 
taken in this? and is the lust for gain, power and domin- 
ion, the old libido dominandi, the true guide to victory? 
For a while we wonder. But not for long. For as we 
think in a flash of things like desolated Liége and Lou- 
vain, we are shaken and are forced to ask ourselves 
whether he who rules his spirit is not “greater than he 
that taketh a city” and perhaps we recall Plato’s for- 
gotten words: “For a man to conquer himself is the 
first and best of all victories.”* 
What theory of life and living do we hold? What 
kind of preparation for life here in this tempest of trial, 
as well as for gentler times, do we want those we love to 
have? 'The questions will not down. They are bound 
to determine our attitude toward education and every 
other phase of life. Is material success the end or only 
something subordinate to a better end? And is that 
better end the one thing which ought to rule human 
life? Or is selfishness, raw or refined, the end? [If it is, 
there is no standard to save us from moral decline and 
consequent loss of freedom. But if it is not; if we are 
men and not merely examples of animal behavior, then 
we may help to save the modern world and share the 
glory of rebuilding it more surely on its true foundation. 
Thoughts of this sort have been sounding the undertone 
of recent days and calling us to consider again the mean- 
ing of our life and our preparation for life through 
education.

  INTRODUCTION 5 
Its practical bearing 
This is not mere dreaming. It is something close and 
friendly to the practical side. No man of sense would 
do anything else than help to increase the chances for 
our youth to make their living and to provide amply the 
education needed for this end. It is for the public good. 
Nine-tenths of them must begin early to earn their 
bread. They are the bone and sinew of the land. They 
should get all the vocational training they need. Also, 
they should get as much more sound schooling as they 
can take in the elements of general knowledge. For 
they too have minds and hearts, as well as hands. Kye 
skill and hand skill are good, and mind skill is better. 
If they are to be more than animate tools doing a daily 
stint of toil, they need the joys and hopes of knowledge 
to help them rise in the scale of life and to open 
glimpses into broad fields outside the little lane of their 
vocation. It is their right. 
Is this to be our whole provision? Is there nothing 
further to be furnished, open to all who can take it and 
not confined to the few who can pay for it? If so, our 
democracy cuts off from most of its youth of higher 
promise their best chance to rise. It reduces the des- 
perately needed supply of leaders equipped with trained 
intelligence, sons of the people who may render the 
people services of priceless value, far outweighing even 
the largest cost of their education. To deny them this 
chance is to waste our best wealth, both material and 
moral. It seems strange there is any need to argue 
these simple things. And yet millions in our land are 
even now indifferent to them. So we have to learn again 
the lesson that our public and private welfare depends 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6° VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
not only on virtue, but on widely diffused intelligence, 
and that a higher education which really educates must 
be vigorously and generally sustained unless our land is 
to sink into a sort of mediocre provincial dependence in 
the things which most concern our intellectual life. 
Once give up the effort to rise as rational beings from 
lower to higher and from higher to highest, there is no 
force that will hold us up even to where we now are. 
We are always moving up or down. It is in truth, if 
one dare quote an old author again, the “immortal con- 
flict” of Plato “now going on” (he speaks as if today) 
“and calling for marvellous vigilance.” And then he 
adds so finely: “In it our allies are the gods and all 
good spirits.”? Serious as the visible war raging today 
is this invisible conflict of “Soul with Sense” in our edu- 
cation and on its issue the welfare of our nation de- 
pends as truly as on success in the fields of France. 
The greater part of our people believe in maintain- 
ing education beyond the elementary stage. Our sec- 
ondary schools, colleges of liberal studies, technical 
schools and professional schools exist in great abun- 
dance and variety. No argument seems needed for 
technical and professional studies, for they prepare stu- 
dents to enter on definite and fairly remunerative ca- 
reers. But there is some hostility and much confusion 
in regard to liberal education in schools and colleges, 
and a good deal of the hostility springs from the con- 
fusion. The confusion is due to many causes, among 
them the diversity of interests in different regions, in- 
difference to mental training as being in itself of “no 
use,” the weaker instincts of unformed minds, the dis- 
tracting multitude of possible studies, ignorance of the 
2 Republic X 906.
-P-A-G-E-15
INTRODUCTION 7 
history of education, poor salaries, uncertain tenure, 
imperfect teaching, lack of agreement among school 
and college authorities, occasional disastrous political in- 
terference and the fact that many weaker institutions 
are unable to maintain any standards except those which 
from time to time happen to suit the likings of their 
clientele. Add to this the notion, now happily declining 
in favor, that students on entering college are better 
qualified to decide what they should study than the best 
educated experience is qualified to advise them. The re- 
sult is acknowledged to have been wasteful and dis- 
couraging. ‘This must be remedied or the schools and 
colleges will suffer more. Yet one fact of power and en- 
couragement has already appeared. The war, with its 
clamorous call to discipline and duty, is producing a 
revulsion of feeling which may bring in its train a ben- 
eficent and lasting influence. We are at last done with 
the capricious view of duty. The amateur no longer 
counts and the “slacker” is in disgrace. The “free elec- 
tive system” is dead and the war has buried it. In fact 
it has not been the practical instinct alone, but also the 
longing for something definite and dependable which 
has swelled the growth of technical education, with its 
fixed demands, at the expense of a liberal education dis- 
jointed from so much looseness of election. 
The latest assault on mental training 
At this juncture we have the remarkable spectacle of 
attacks on disciplinary studies, just as the trend was 
setting in toward more definite training. Mathematics 
and classics were assailed as antiquated and needless. 
The attack went farther and assailed the very idea of 
intellectual discipline as unsound, on the ground that it
-P-A-G-E-16
    8 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
is “content” and not “form” which is important. Class- 
ics and mathematics were decried as fretting hindrances 
to intellectual progress and the results in other studies 
were said to be demonstrably better. Of course if the 
mind is not susceptible to training or not benefited by 
it, the conclusion is sound. And if classics and mathe- 
matics are really proofs of this, they should be discarded 
as instruments of education. To the assertion that the 
human mind is not improved by disciplinary training 
there is a short and ready answer. It is that the asser- 
tion, if true, can be proved by facts. If the facts say 
so, that ends the controversy. Otherwise the assertion 
has no more value than any other unproved speculation. 
If, however, the facts are against the assertion, it is 
worse than unproved; it is disproved. We do not mean 
isolated or scattered facts, but the mass of obtainable 
evidence wherein all the facts appear in their relation 
and thus disclose the truth. And in modern times, 
when large systems of education have been constructed 
and operated on the theory that the human mind could 
and should be trained, and that it was best trained by 
means of studies of ascertained general value, there is 
need of a large amount of well tested evidence to dis- 
credit this verdict of wide experience and the reasoned 
judgment of many of the ablest minds of the race. If 
such a body of evidential facts exists, it should be pro- 
duced. It has not been produced. There is reason to 
believe it cannot be produced. Yet the attack has done 
good. It has made men examine the foundations anew 
and has thus helped to bring truth to light. We may 
then turn with some comfort to the saying of Aristotle, 
not because it is old, but because it is wise, that we owe
-P-A-G-E-17
  INTRODUCTION 9 
thanks to those who agree with us and also to those who 
differ, “because the latter have furnished us something; 
exercise” in seeking the truth.* 
The two objections to the classics 
The arguments against classics and mathematics, for 
the two are one in the present discussion, may be read 
better in the writers who advance them. But in sub- 
stance they all reduce to two questions, the way these 
studies are taught and the nature of the studies them- 
selves. The first is a question of fact, the second mainly 
of theory. We shall deal with each question so far as it 
affects the classics. As for the other, we may leave it 
aside, consoling ourselves provisionally with the dictum 
of Francis Bacon: “If a man’s wits be wandering, let 
him study mathematics.” 
The faults of classical teaching 
Let us look at the first question. How are the clas- 
sics taught, well or poorly? It is, as said, a question of 
fact. We admit they are sometimes poorly taught and 
generally more poorly taught than they ought to be 
and might be. We admit more, namely, that this com- 
plaint has been heard in almost every generation since 
the sixteenth century. Descartes lamented the barren 
methods of his student days in the college of La F'léche. 
Milton exceeds his wonted measure of vigor in denounc- 
ing the “asinine feast of sow’s thistles” which was served 
up to him. Heine wrote of his Latin: “Often have I 
prayed that I might be enabled to remember the irregu- 
lar verbs” and felt sure the Romans would never have 
found time to conquer the world if they had been first 
compelled to master their grammar. It is an old story 
3 Metaphysics I brev. 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
with a serious and a humorous side. And such com- 
plaints are heard today from men who are qualified to 
speak with knowledge, some of them in the high places 
of education. We shall do well to heed them, because 
they are protesting against the pedantry of lifeless 
teaching. We may, however, note in passing that the 
teacher is not always the only one at fault. Lazy stu- 
dents shirking the toil of study and dull students unre- 
sponsive to even the finest teaching do much to bring on 
the débdcle. And it is strange that scarcely anyone 
who in later life finds his classical schooling was irritat- 
ing and useless states that he may have been to blame 
for it himself. So easily do we excuse ourselves. 
Men sometimes say they have forgotten their Latin 
and Greek and conclude that they were therefore 
poorly taught and that the time spent on them was 
wasted. Do they remember more than the scraps of 
other studies unless they have kept them up? Do they 
hold in active view many items of physics or chemistry 
or philosophy? Can they state accurately the law of 
gravitation or recall much of anything outside the 
studies of description and narration? Even there, how 
many can repeat from memory the list of our Presi- 
dents or recite The Star Spangled Banner? Try it. 
What we can remember is worth much, but what we had 
to nourish our minds in school and college counts for 
far more. It is like food. Who, unless he was on 
fixed diet, remembers what he ate a week ago last Thurs- 
day? or can recall his menu for each day of the past 
month? Yet the effects continue. And it is the nature 
of our diet in youth, as all know, which does much to 
determine our health in manhood.
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION ll 
Nevertheless there is something the matter with 
American classical teaching, perhaps not so much in 
school, however, as in college. At best we have only half 
the time for prescribed classics as compared with the 
time given in European countries. We are expected to 
produce comparable results. The remedy of remedies 
here is to begin earlier. Then too the classics are often 
made optional and put in unequal competition with eas- 
ier and lighter subjects, some of them not much more 
than baby play. Is it any wonder that immature stu- 
dents thus circumstanced “follow the line of least re- 
sistance,” leaving the harder for the easier road and ex- 
erting an influence which weakens the virility of classi- 
cal teaching? “Though all men doubtless desire know]- 
edge,” wrote Richard de Bury most quaintly, “all do not 
equally delight in learning.” Here is a great obstacle in 
the way of all school training, and it must be sur- 
mounted. For if we believe the evidence of experience, 
we are sure the human mind will not attain its best de- 
velopment without repeated exercise in overcoming dif- 
ficulties any more than the human body will do so. Nor 
will it attain the balance and grace that come with well 
developed strength. 
Moreover classical teaching is sometimes dull or un- 
interesting. The first is always the fault of the teacher, 
the second sometimes of the teacher and sometimes of 
the student. There is no excuse whatever for the 
teacher who is dull, and none for the teacher who is un- 
interesting when the student is capable and willing to 
learn. But it is unfair to insist that the teacher shall be 
interesting when the student is unwilling to give his 
attention and make his own effort. There is no interest
-P-A-G-E-20
  12 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
without attention, and no attention without an act of 
will. Will, rousing attention and leading to effort, will 
generally awaken interest even when the teacher is of 
only ordinary power. And immediate interest, valuable 
as it is, is not a sure test of the value of anything. In- 
trinsic importance and communicability are the final 
educational tests of value for studies, attention and ef- 
fort the tests for students, and skill in reading and guid- 
ing the student’s mind the test for teachers. These 
given, interest will develop steadily and often rapidly in 
all capable students. Here is the true basis for teach- 
ing in every curriculum at every stage of education. 
So the true teacher has two clear powers, knowledge 
of the subject he teaches and knowledge of the object 
he teaches—the student. And one thing more—intui- 
tive sympathy. Without it he will fail with all except 
those who are willing to work. With it he may save 
even the dawdlers and laggards. It gives him almost 
magical skill in divining his student’s need and in show- 
ing him the way, step by step, from ignorance to 
brightening knowledge. This, above all, is what wakens 
desire for mastery and incites to strenuous effort. It 
gets behind the human will; attention wakes and effort 
follows. 
We need hardly say that few classical teachers and 
few of any other sort measure up to this standard. Yet 
many are striving hard to do so. Whether the classical 
teaching is better or worse than the general run is what 
we need to know. For not until the American people 
make the career of teaching a profession with its just 
meed of support and honor can we for a long time to 
come expect much better teaching than we now have.
-P-A-G-E-21

INTRODUCTION 13 
So intimately is the question of the quality of classical 
teaching inwoven with the rest. 
One point needs to be noted in college teaching. The 
younger collegians are not as a rule in the hands of the 
most skilful teachers of the faculty, as they ought to be. 
Freshmen often say they had better teaching in the last 
year of school than in the first year of college. Head- 
masters say the same. Too many college instructors of 
freshmen are inexperienced in the art of teaching. They 
are sometimes consequential and fussy, sometimes heavy 
and slow and oftener lacking in the grace and skill born 
of sympathy. Some seem unconscious of the needs of 
their students. Their training as Doctors of Philosophy 
has not usually prepared them for this task, and many 
of them have to learn it from the beginning. The fate 
of the classics in college largely depends on providing 
the best teaching for freshmen. And it should be humane 
and enlightening throughout the whole course. Yet the 
trouble is not confined to the classics. It is common in 
other subjects also. 
‘When shall we wake to the need of fine teaching in 
the essential studies? It can hardly be questioned that 
our boys who come to college are in school education 
two years behind the boys of like age in England, 
France and Germany. With these two years saved and 
devoted to well taught essential studies, many of our 
college difficulties, classics included, would be overcome. 
How should the classics be taught? 
We need, then, to start in the classics earlier and 
teach them better. We need something more—fresh- 
ening of spirit. This will not come by exhortation or 
emotional endeavor. It will come when we regain the
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
  spirit which caused the Revival of Learning, the “first 
fine careless rapture” of the Renaissance. Latin and 
Greek must be made natural to the American boy, as 
they were native to the boys of Rome and Athens. Fol- 
low the lead of Erasmus and Colet and Melancthon. 
Then the dead will wake and speak again. It is often 
said that enthusiasm without precision was a mark of 
the Renaissance. Precision without enthusiasm is our 
danger now—or else silly superficiality and dilution in 
order to make the classics “interesting.” It is hard to 
say it—but even this is better than dull pedantry. Once 
the right spirit and method is in our teaching and we 
can begin early enough to take young minds when they 
are most plastic to the sounds, images and memories of 
language, the classics will be vividly “interesting.” The 
subject is too large for this paper, but a few points may 
be noted. Begin two years earlier, taking boys of eleven 
or twelve. Remember the saying of Quintilian, great- 
est of Roman teachers, that we first take in language by 
ear. Let the American boy learn Latin somewhat in 
the way the Roman boy of his years learned it, only 
more simply. Tell him—not show him—a Latin word 
or easiest phrase and its meaning; homo sum, puer es, 
quota hora est? quid rides? and so on. Have him say 
them first and then write them. Never mind if every 
word is not carefully Ciceronian. He too sometimes 
lapsed in his daily talk—and there must have been a 
lot of it. Then there were other fine old Romans who 
did not always “speak by the book.” And vow populi, 
vox Dei is perfect Latin though Alcuin wrote it, as well 
as cogito ergo swm made in France by Descartes. Use 
freely the Latin words that are English and show their
-P-A-G-E-23
INTRODUCTION 15 
meaning: omnibus, circus, item, tandem, extra, et cetera. 
Show the boy the Latin, old or new, that runs through 
the world of geography (Africa, Asia, America, Aus- 
tralia, Virginia, Canada) all the way to the far off 
“beautiful” island of Formosa. Saying is everything 
here. It is the original, living, convincing utterance, the 
verba labris nascentia of Quintilian, “words born on the 
lips,” which alone is actual Speech. With this daily 
usage continued, the auditional dread of Latin, so com- 
mon now, would disappear and the boy would begin to 
get the Latin consciousness. 
Two years of this simple conversational Latin of the 
kind that can be picked out or made up from Terence, 
Cicero’s letters, Aulus Gellius and Augustine, practice 
in writing easy sentences in the simpler constructions of 
the sermo cotidianus of Rome, avoiding meanwhile the 
periodic sentence and finished works of adult literature 
(not made for young Roman boys) and keeping to 
thoughts and expressions within the sphere of boyhood, 
using coins, graffiti, inscriptions on cups, sling stones, 
weapons and other things of common life, saying max- 
ims, proverbs and other immortal quotable phrases 
(dulce et decorum est pro patria mori), trying the fa- 
bles, “tales and golden histories” so far as we can, 
perhaps opening a little mythology in Ovid, reading 
aloud in selected parts of the Psalter and the Gospels, 
and writing, writing, writing the Latin he says, perhaps 
making some for himself in the form of a letter or 
story—something like this is the course that will bring 
a boy ready, really ready, and happy to begin his harder 
task of reading the serious literary Latin, equipped with 
a vocabulary that is sounding in his ears, a natural habit
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
of saying and writing simpler Latin and a large store of 
satisfying information. Does it sound too easy? It is 
hard enough for a boy of twelve. 
Where does grammar come in? Everywhere—at first 
most simply by sorting words according to their kinds 
and then by moving on, one step at a time, to arrange 
them clearly under the laws of the language. When 
the dreaded “exceptions” occur, help the boy to use his 
wits and, if need be, his wit to fasten them in his mind. 
Take a most simple example. Words that look femi- 
nine and are masculine may annoy him awhile. Let his 
humor help him in handling agricola and pirata by say- 
ing in Latin “The bad farmer loves the good pirate.” 
He will never forget this. Thus the boy is continual- 
ly finding the grammar inside the used and usable 
language, instead of trying first to find the language in 
the grammar. He begins to learn the rules of the game 
by watching and trying the game. He may next go on 
to understand the game better by mastering the rules. 
This done, he knows how to play the game. How well 
he will play it then depends mainly on himself. 
‘Where does the literature come in? Everywhere— 
just as soon as he begins to read the easier Latin books, 
boys’ reading at first, men’s reading as soon thereafter 
as is practicable. ‘Then as vistas begin to open and 
perspectives to lengthen, he begins to get his reward. 
He has climbed the Hill Difficulty and may look out 
with clear vision upon the broad realm of literature and 
the long perspectives of history. 
A life given to teaching Latin has gradually forced 
me to conclude that this is the true way to bring Latin 
alive into our modern consciousness. It does not call

for skilled conversationalists as teachers. Three months 
oral practice will give almost any Latin teacher enough 
of a start. In classical training, as elsewhere, it is the 
beginning that settles almost everything. ‘This is the 
method and spirit which in varying forms inspired the 
teachers of the Renaissance. And what is true for Latin 
is as true for Greek. Utrique eadem via est.* 
The successful results of classical teaching 
We have looked at the faults and failings in our clas- 
sical teaching and have also tried to point out the reme- 
dies. We may now turn to the brighter side. It is very 
bright. No matter what the cause, all the available in- 
formation shows that the classical generally surpass the 
non-classical students in school and college studies. If 
the teaching is bad, such students.must be heroes. In 
our college entrance examinations the percentage of suc- 
cess in Greek and Latin is higher than in the other 
largely taken subjects. It is distinctly ahead of the re- 
sults in mathematics, chemistry, history, English and 
the other modern languages, and about even in physics 
—the studies which, with the classics, form the stock and 
staple of preparation for college. The comparative 
record of classically trained students in college is also 
highly satisfactory. Here are ascertained facts which 
anyone may examine—the largest and latest body of 
evidence now available. ‘The superiority of the classi- 
cal students is beyond question. What then becomes 
of the charge that the classics are poorly taught? This: 
that if they are, most other subjects appear to be taught 
more poorly. The assertion was: ‘The classics are 
poorly taught; therefore they should be discarded. But

other important subjects appear to be more poorly 
taught; therefore they should be—what? Discarded? 
No one thinks so. Why then should the less poorly 
taught classics be discarded? 
Are these good results due to the ability of the students? 
To this no answer is made except that the evident 
superiority, which is perforce admitted, is due wholly 
or mainly to the greater ability of classical students and 
not to their studies or teaching, and that it is the tradi- 
tional tendency of such students to take classics which 
explains the result. If it is only “mainly” the reason, 
then the studies and teaching must account for a part of 
the result, perhaps a small part, but still something real. 
And if the charge of comparatively bad teaching is not 
abandoned, the nature of the studies must figure as 
the remaining contributing factor. If it is “wholly” the 
reason, the case is different. Let us suppose it is the 
whole reason. Then if it is no argument for the classics 
that it is customary for the abler students to take them, 
nothing more can be concluded than that this fact is not 
a proof that the classics are intrinsically valuable 
studies. And certainly the fact that the abler students 
prefer the classics proves nothing against their value. 
The abler students are the more intelligent as contrasted 
with the less intelligent, the mediocre and the dull. 
Ability commonly implies greater independence and 
probable decision of questions on rational grounds. It 
is the more intelligent who are the less obsequious to 
mere tradition. The fact that the abler students take 
the classics therefore looks at least like an indication that 
they do so not merely because their fathers did so, but 
because it is also an intelligent thing to do.
-P-A-G-E-27
   INTRODUCTION 19 
It is strange that the explanation, or rather the asser- 
tion, should assume that the students are the only im- 
portant factor in the case. Modern science has taught 
us to accept the truth that there are always and every- 
where two prime factors in the evolution of man—he- 
redity and environment. What you are in yourself and 
what you get from outside—these two determine human 
life. In this case the student is the factor of heredity; 
studies and teachers are his educational environment. 
It is admittedly irrational to suppose that education is 
the one sphere of life where heredity and environment 
fail to act and react on each other. There is not the 
faintest reason for suspecting that a race of comparably 
able students environed for generations by teachers dis- 
pensing Old Norse and Esperanto would turn out as 
well as those produced in the study of Latin and Greek 
or French and German or Italian and Spanish. The 
reason is that the latter studies have proved themselves 
worth more for intellectual development. The same 
reasoning applies in other fields of study. History is 
worth more than heraldry, geometry than gauging, bi- 
ology than conchology and philosophy than pedagogy. 
The explanation, then, is that both prime factors, the 
student and his environment of studies and teachers, 
always enter into the result. We are thus driven to 
conclude that in some appreciable measure classical 
studies do influence intellectual development, and the 
available evidence indicates that the natural effect of 
this influence is commonly good. 
Are the classics a useless mental discipline? 
The second objection to the classics is based on their 
nature as a useless “formal” discipline, having a “con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28

tent” of value, indeed, but one which is sufficiently avail- 
able in translations. We need not spend much time on 
the question of intellectual discipline, “formal” or of 
any other imaginable kind, if there is any. If “formal” 
discipline is used in some artificial or mysterious sense, 
we need not trouble ourselves to understand it. If it 
means teaching empty abstractions to the young or 
teaching in a stiff ceremonial manner or teaching the 
structural part of a study without clear illustration by 
examples, every one should reject it. If, however, it 
means something strict and regular, the meaning so 
commonly used in daily life, then it is not unfair to re- 
mark in passing that a most famous recent example of 
“formal” discipline is observable in the French defence 
of Verdun, whereas the confused retreat of a part of the 
Russian army, turned for the moment by agitators into 
a sort of debating society, is a good example of rather 
“informal” discipline. 
“Formal” discipline and “content” are implied in 
varying degree in all studies which have intellectual 
structure. In some it is a highly vertebrate structure, as 
in physics. In others it is of somewhat invertebrate 
structure, as in the history of American literature. 
Studies without an intellectual structure are not studies, 
though pleasant and useful as diversions from study. Of 
course, if the mind is not benefited by training in studies, 
“formal” discipline must go. Here we are in a region 
which is largely theoretical and where discussion without 
solution of the question at issue may be interminable. 
‘We cannot as yet put the minds of children under micro- 
scopes or flood them with X-rays and observe directly 
the effect of studies involving “formal” discipline. So

we must be content with indirect experiment and judge 
by what seem to be the effects in human experience. It 
is largely a question of observed habits and tendencies 
under different conditions, a question of probable evi- 
dence. We have to look about us for what light we can 
get from today and to inspect history for the rest. In 
so doing we may leave out the few cases of spontaneous 
genius or extraordinary ability. What of the mass of 
mankind? And what of the most reliable educational 
opinion? For ages it has been the view of most of the 
master thinkers that the human mind does not develop 
well without exercise and that it is developed most 
highly by mastering knowledge which is both difficult 
and valuable. In the world’s conflict the undisciplined 
mind has generally been beaten. So we take sides with 
what has the preponderating weight of existing evidence 
to support it. If the opinion that “formal” discipline is 
irrational is sound, there is a foundation for establishing 
resorts for interesting information, but none is left for 
schools of education. At present we need not be troubled 
greatly. The war is waking in vigor the thought of 
discipline and duty, and the pleasant winding way is be- 
ing deserted for the straight and narrow path. 
Here we may be told we are all wrong because the 
newer psychology has experimentally disproved the 
idea of mental discipline. The subject is inviting, even 
alluring, but there is no space to go into it fully here. 
If anyone will read the writings of its advocates, he will 
learn much and will soon discover how imperfect and 
curious their notion of proof is. There is, moreover, no

thorough agreement among psychologists that the proof 
is conclusive or even considerable. On this point we 
may quote an authority of distinction, Professor Strat- 
ton, former President of the American Psychological 
Association, who writes as follows—and since the war 
began: 
“The mind is something far larger than the particu- 
lar items which it observes and hears. It is a powerful 
organism, with powers latent, powers developed, pow- 
ers lost through disuse. Any schooling seems to me a 
failure that overlooks this and regards the mind as a 
mere assembly of interesting ideas and of useful items 
of information. Education must train a person to will 
aright and to work, and to withstand inner and outer 
distractions, as well as to act not only with a sympathy 
for human beings near at hand but also with sympathy 
and with understanding of distant peoples and distant 
times. The findings of psychology all favor this richer 
conception of the human person, and it would be a grave 
mistake to suppose that the experimental work has 
proved that the idea of mental discipline is no longer 
tenable.’ 
Dean Lange of the School of Education in the Uni- 
versity of California also writes: “Just because it is so 
radial in the specific disciplines it can be made to fur- 
nish (the results of which are transferable, at least to 
things that are human), Latin as an educational means 
has virtues that other subjects have not.”* Meanwhile 
we may rest content as to this supposedly irresistible

proof. It has not yet been furnished. “Saying so,” as 
Lincoln was fond of observing, “does not make it so.” 
The newer psychology has some deep places and some 
deep thinkers—from Wundt onward. For these few 
there are scores and hundreds of others who splash in its 
shallows, muddying the waters and muddling them- 
selves. Nowhere else does the “miscellaneously minded” 
man—not the universally minded, but the scatterbrain 
—disport himself more freely. Think seriously, if you 
can, of such observations as these: that young children 
step about like young chickens, rapid eating is a sign of 
fear and “Key declares that intense mental activity 
among the upper classes of Sweden has resulted in a 
marked increase in the tendency to nose bleed.” Un- 
less taken lightly, such things are disconcerting. They 
are better added to our treasure of the aphorisms of 
Josh Billings: “Rats originally came from Norway 
and I wish they had originally stayed there,” “Chaucer 
was a good poet, but the trouble was he could not spell.” 
Will not translations serve well enough? 
The statement that the classics are sufficiently avail- 
able for modern purposes in the form of translations 
deserves attention. Good translations are the next 
best thing to the originals. A vast amount of knowl- 
edge and profit is to be gained from them. By all means 
let those who cannot consult the originals, and also those 
who can, read fine versions. Some of them are English 
classics, such as Dryden’s Virgil, Jowett’s Plato and 
Jebb’s Sophocles. So far as full reproduction of the 
tone and spirit of the originals is concerned, readers of 
translations will lose least in the books of information, 
such as Arrian, Polybius, Manilius, Pliny the Elder and

| Aristotle’s Natural History, and most in the works of 
| style and vision. They will get much and lose much in 
| Herodotus and Thucydides and Tacitus. Tam diu Ger- 
mania vincitur, wrote Tacitus, grimly summing up in 
four words two centuries of wars between Rome and the 
Germans. Who can put in English or any other 
tongue the strength and irony of this sketch in four 
strokes? No one has done so. Still, on the whole, read- 
ers of good versions will get nearest to the originals in 
the records of history and erudition. And “ancient his- 
tory,” as Bryce observes, “is the key to all history.” 
They will be farthest away in reading the poets. 
It takes genius to translate genius finely. Even then 
something is always lost. The best reflection is less than 
the full light, and often the best reflection cannot be 
obtained. The “disillusion” of translations, which are 
not actual works of re-creation, is easily proved, and the 
works of re-creation are very rare. The translators 
themselves are the best witnesses to this. Shakespeare 
in German is amusingly interesting to the point of mer- 
riment and Homer’s hexameters in that tongue thump 
in heavy tumbling lines. Milton tried his hand at Hor- 
ace and turned fickle Pyrrha into a Priscilla. Ben Jon- 
son did best of all in his part version and part creation 
of “Drink to me only with thine eyes” and then trans- 
lated the thrilling Vivamus mea Lesbia atque amemus 
of Catullus with graceful inadequacy. Where these 
failed,who shall succeed? And in prose who shall ever 
copy perfectly Livy’s picture of the dying Tarquin or 
Cicero’s words to his son at the end of the De Officiis or 
the battle of Thermopylae in Herodotus or Plato’s 
serene look as he tells of the payn a0dvaros, the “immor- 
tal conflict” between the hosts of Good and Evil, or the

majestic rhythm of Augustine’s Visibilium omniwm 
maximus est mundus; invisibilium omnium maximus est 
Deus. In poetry the task is harder and often impossi- 
ble. The unforgettable lines! how they haunt the mem- 
ory by hundreds—living, appealing, enchanting. Take 
three instances atrandom. For splendor take the vision 
of Ennius of the night sky filled with stars: 
O magna templa caelitum commizta stellis splendidis

exquisitely attempted by Catullus, but in vain, and the 
despair of poets ever since. 
So translations are like photographs, best for repro- 
ducing drawings and worst for sunsets. It is as though 
one who could not see the French cathedrals or the pyra- 
mids should acquaint himself with good photographs 
and engravings or, in rare cases, with good paintings of 
them. But they are not the cathedrals or the pyramids. 
They are the next best thing, unless, as may be the case, 
the tales of travellers are better. These, too, are not the 
original, but a teacher’s interpretation—sometimes very 
good and sometimes not. To bring the meaning of all 
this straight home, think of Cowper’s lines on receiving 
his dead mother’s picture: 
O that those lips had language! Life has passed 
With me but roughly since I saw thee last. 
The picture was a precious reflection of his mother’s 
face. It was not his mother.

other sort in the actual words of poets. Their melodies 
reveal visions, so that as we read we seem both to hear 
and see. There is mellow light as well as music in

Are translations sufficient for the best modern edu- 
cation? No one doubts the originals are better than the 
best versions. Why, then, should not those who are 
willing to learn the original languages and enjoy the 
original literature in its original vigor have a really good 
chance and also be urged to take it? This is the day 
when we are told incessantly to “go to the sources” in 
science and history and studies generally. We should 
do the same with the classics and lead everyone who is 
able and willing along the ascending way to the ever 
flowing self renewing Pierian spring. 
The true place of the classics 
The whole case for the classics rests on their proved 
value for modern thought and life. To repeat the evi- 
dence would take volumes and require a full examina- 
tion of the history of modern education. A valuable ex- 
position is to be found in Livingstone’s recent book,°

Viscount Bryce’s last article,* the paper of Principal 
Stearns’? and Professor Shorey’s monograph” are 
three very recent contributions, all of unusual power. 
The addresses, statements and statistics printed in this 
book add material of the first value. 
Out of many good statements of the last generation 
written in English, two are of conspicuous worth in the 
present situation, the plea of James Russell Lowell** 
and the unanswerable argument of John Stuart Mill.** 
We may then turn, finally, to consider briefly the 
place of language, and especially of the classics, in a true 
theory of liberal education, the education which aims to 
develop the human mind to its highest excellence. It 
is clear that language has a necessary function. For all 
except those who lack the power of speech it is the one 
universal means, aside from the material works of 
human skill and the primitive signs and signals, of put- 
ting our thoughts in form and of telling them to others. 
Try to fancy, if you can, a state of things wherein 
there was no use of speech and not one word of 
writing or print. Nothing would be left except to do 
no more than the deaf and dumb can do unhelped 
by those who speak. All communication of thought

that education: It is an attack merely upon its exclusive predominance.”

would be reduced to its lowest terms and generations 
would be needed to accomplish less than may now be 
done in a year. But today, as ever, language is the uni- 
versal currency of thought. The gold and silver and 
baser coin of thought are the stored treasure of the 
mind, which circulates everywhere in the substitute of 
words. On this all sciences and arts largely depend— 
the concerns of business, all trades and professions, lit- 
erature, government, home life and education. All the 
symbols of science are merely language in short hand. 
The written and spoken word rules the world. We are 
getting here to some ancient things, so ancient that they 
seem eternal. Language is the recorder and keeper of 
knowledge for the future. On this much of our progress 
depends. Good knowledge and use of language is of 
prime value for anyone who can talk. Without it a man 
is in some sense illiterate. Men are judged more by 
what they say than by what they think. In case of dis- 
pute over anything we say or write, the question is not 
so much What did he mean to say or write? but What 
is the meaning of what he did say or write? If we are 
called to make explanation, we must use language to 
do it or fall back on the dumb show of signs, winks and 
nods, or else stand dumb like “the horse or the mule 
which have no understanding.” This is all so alarming- 
ly elementary that it seems needless to mention it. But 
it has to be mentioned because it is imbedded so deep in 
tradition that we have lost sight of its immense im- 
portance. 
Granting, then, that language and thought are the 
double foundation and that they are so interlocked as 
to become the single foundation for education from be- 
ginning to end, thought as the soul of language and lan-

guage as the embodiment of thought, audible in speech, 
visible in writing; what follows? That we ought to 
learn to use our own language, of course, and learn to 
use it as well as possible. This happens to be English. 
If it were Chinese, we ought to do the same in that 
tongue. 
But for the mass of English speaking men, rare 
spirits excepted, the best use of English is not attained 
without knowing the sources whence our mother tongue 
draws its life. Nearly half of it is Latin. The better 
we know Latin, then, the better our use of English. And 
as the important modern languages, French, Spanish, 
Italian, are simply Latin in modern guise, Latin is the 
surest and quickest help to learning them. It is 
their ancestral home and largely ours also. Three hun- 
dred millions of our modern civilized world speak one 
or more of them, including much of western Europe, 
both Americas, Australia and many islands of the sea. 
Just now these parts of the world are drawn closer in 
the common cause of war. ‘Their one common underly- 
ing educational factor in language is Latin. It is the 
key which opens many doors, and many more than we 
have mentioned. Such are the simpler practical reasons 
for studying it. There is little space to say more. 
There is a higher argument for the classics which may 
be briefly indicated. If they are something by them- 
selves and not a necessary element for the best liberal 
education of the western civilized world, they may be 
left to whatever fate time shall give them. But if they 
are somewhere necessary in a true theory of our western 
liberal education, if they are an integral part of our 
problem, the case is different and their importance is 
evident.

    30 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
What are the things a really liberally educated man 
ought to know? Every human being who thinks, or 
who does not think, is faced by three commanding in- 
tellectual questions so long as he lives on this planet. 
The first is the problem of the vast world of nature, the 
world of things outside him, the largest and outermost 
circle, within which his whole life is spent. The answers 
to this problem, so far as given at all, are given in mathe- 
matics and the sciences. There are just four of them, 
all the others being combinations or derivatives. They 
are, first of all, mathematics for the underlying abstract 
relations of space and number, which exist everywhere. 
Next, rising from this, comes physics which deals with 
matter and energy. It extends to its sequel in chemis- 
try, which deals with the analysis and synthesis of the 
elements of matter. From this rises biology, the science 
of all living matter. These four compose the central 
body of the sciences. They are best known by begin- 
ning with the foundation in mathematics and rising to 
physics and then to chemistry and biology. The liber- 
ally educated man needs, then, to know the elements of 
mathematics and physics and to get some chemistry and 
biology also, so far as possible. There is room in school 
and college for the elements of all four. 
The second is the problem of mankind, the world of 
persons outside him, the smaller circle inside the vaster 
circle of nature. Within this large but lesser circle he 
must also spend his whole life unless he retires to a 
desert. Even there he may meet other men. The 
answers to this problem of mankind are written in what 
we may call history, the whole record of the collective 
activity of the race. Here the mother study, source of 
all the rest, is history proper, and for us the history of
-P-A-G-E-39
  INTRODUCTION 81 
our own civilization. Historians agree that the funda- 
mental thing here is our own ancient history, the story 
of Greece and Rome. This the liberally educated man 
should know, at least in its important lessons. He 
should also learn as much later history as he can, includ- 
ing, of course, the history of his own land, which he al- 
ways has a good chance to learn anyway. The elements 
of political and economic studies should also be known 
for their revelation of the fundamental laws of govern- 
ment and business. 
The third is the problem of individual man, the tiny 
world of self, the centre of all our interest in the large 
world of mankind and the larger world of nature. Here 
is the fixed centre of all our education, whatever be its 
circumference. Here we learn to know ourselves first 
by learning to express ourselves in language and then 
in literature, thus also extending our knowledge out- 
ward into the ever near world of mankind. The one 
question, then, is what languages and literatures will 
best serve this end for men who live in the world of 
western civilization. The answer is easy. Our own 
language of course and if there is time, as there is, the 
languages which best train us in expression and the lit- 
eratures which best help us to understand both ourselves 
and our civilization. More, if practicable, but this any- 
way. This means and can mean only one thing, the 
classics as fundamental to the best art of expression 
and the meaning of our civilization. The relation of 
the classics to this is not incidental but radical, like the 
relation of chemistry to biology or of history to political 
science. This means Latin for most, because of its more 
obviously practical values. It means Greek also for  
-P-A-G-E-40
  82 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
many, for all who want the best, even the best Latin. 
For intellectually the two are one, and the one is Greek. 
It is the light of Latin. Without it Latin studies are 
cut off from a large range of illumination and support. 
Directly and through the lantern of Latin it has shone 
for centuries as a guiding light in the modern world of 
knowledge. It was not we nor the Romans, but the 
Greeks, who first wrote out and best wrote out the 
meaning of life as they saw it naively and clearly in the 
bright morning light of the springtime of the world. 
Ver illud erat. It was not we but they who first called 
the world to democracy and freedom. Do we care for 
these things? Do we care to know them well? Then 
study Greek and hear their story as they told it. The 
decline in Greek studies is most discreditable to us. We 
have been losing the one most perfect language and the 
one literature, besides our own, of the greatest value. 
Many boys who would be glad to study it cannot get the 
chance. It should be provided in all our considerable 
secondary schools and has a moral right to its historic 
place as a requirement for the Bachelor of Arts degree 
in all our colleges. 
With even a fair elementary knowledge of the classics 
acquired, the way is cleared for mastering with greater 
ease the modern languages. At least one of these — 
should be well studied. There will be time to do so. 
The three problems converge in one. Man’s knowl- 
edge of nature and mankind assembles in himself. What 
explains all three? Native belief in the unity of truth 
compels him to seek an answer. To help him in this he 
should learn the elements of philosophy which attempts 
the whole problem. Here the human mind attains its

widest range of vision. And if all his problems are not 
solved, he at least learns clearly what the problems are 
and what is their relation. Such a man will always be 
able to “collect his thoughts” and also to “know where 
he is.” Such is the order and summation of the knowl- 
edge which liberates and liberalizes man. There is time 
to get a sound elementary acquaintance with it in school 
and college days. If it is not done then, it may never 
be done. It is too great a risk to leave to chance. 
Thus the cause of the classics is part of larger ques- 
tions—the unity of our higher knowledge, the best train- 
ing for all who can take it, the welfare of our land. 
Mathematics and classics, science and philosophy, his- 
tory and modern literature are the nobler sons in the 
household of liberal training. To have known them all 
well enough to like them all, no matter which one we 
come to like most, is the best liberal education. 
We are called anew to duty in the time of trial and 
may well listen to voices of the past which bid us prepare 
well to play our part like men. We shall need their help. 
Hear, then, in closing, the brave words of Carlyle to the 
students of Edinburgh: “This is what the poet sings, a 
kind of road melody or marching-music of mankind: 
Heard are the Voices, 
Heard are the Sages, 
The Worlds and the Ages: 
Choose well; your choice is 
Brief and yet endless.”

ADDRESSES AT CONFERENCE

I 
Joun Grier Hissen President of Princeton University 
I wish to extend to you a very hearty welcome to 
Princeton University on this occasion, and at the same 
time to thank you for your presence, for your interest 
and cooperation in the exercises of the day. 
Some may think—I do not know of anyone present, 
however—but some persons may think that this a 
very inopportune time to hold a conference of this sort, 
in the midst of war and our preparations for war. I 
think it is a relief to us all to turn aside from our anxie- 
ties and our yearnings to consider such a subject as 
this; but more than that, it seems to me eminently ap- 
propriate for us at this time, confronted as we are 
by all the tragedies of this war, to look forward to the 
time when a new generation is to take up the problems 
and to bear the burdens of the new day. 
We have resting upon us and upon all educational in- 
stitutions a very serious responsibility, and we may well 
pause at this time to consider the nature of that respon- 
sibility in preparing the young men and women of the 
present day for the burdens which they will have to 
carry in the future, for their task in the upbuilding of a 
new world. For we hope—and take away that hope 
from us, nothing is left that is valuable in life—we 
hope and we confidently expect that it will not only be 
a new world, but a better world. In order that the 
87
-P-A-G-E-46
  88 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
young boys and girls of the present day may meet their 
responsibilities and may be equal to their tasks, they 
must have a vigor of mind such as the world has not 
known and perhaps not even conceived. And it is be- 
cause we feel that classical studies impart this vigor of 
intellect that we believe in them in any educational pro- 
ject whatsoever. 
I saw a notice a few days ago in a paper that was pre- 
pared by a professor in one of our State universities, 
in which he drew attention to what he considered 
the sign and symbol of a new departure in education. 
With great satisfaction to himself and exaltation of 
spirit, he drew attention to the fact that in one of our 
older State schools they had brought in and placed upon 
the platform a collie dog, for the purposes of direct and 
minute and systematic observation on the part of the 
children—their attention being fixed upon the habits 
and pranks of this animal. And this professor drew at- 
tention to the fact that years ago in the tradition of edu- 
cation there had been a time when a lamb, “Mary’s lit- 
tle lamb,” had been driven out of the school and the chil- 
dren not allowed to observe its habits and idiosyncra- 
cies. This is the day, he said, of the collie dog—of 
drawing the attention of children to nature studies so 
that they can observe and note what they have observed. 
I am entirely in sympathy, ladies and gentlemen, 
with bringing to the attention of our children every- 
thing in this bountiful, mysterious world of nature, 
every plant, every flower, every animal that can be pre- 
sented to their attention and interest in every possible 
way. I do not think that there is any better device in 
the bringing up of a child than for him daily to asso- 
ciate with a dog in the family.
-P-A-G-E-47
ADDRESSES 89 
But when we come to ask the question: How in the 
theory of education are we going to impart not merely 
accurate powers of observation, not merely the mean- 
ings of knowledge, but how are we going to impart 
peculiar vigor of mind; how are we to give to our boys 
and girls an intellectual grip so that they may take hold 
of the essence of things, that they may have a mind that 
will penetrate beneath the surface and beyond the limits 
of a far horizon; how are we to give that vigor of mind 
that this age demands?—it seems to some very absurd 
that in order to fit the young men and women for the 
problems of the present day we should let them go back 
and study languages of the far distant past. 
Why is it absurd? Let me draw attention not merely, 
or not at all, for the purpose of informing you: far from 
that; but merely to express before you my own belief, 
my own intellectual and educational creed. We are 
urging boys and girls to study these ancient lan- 
guages because we believe that there was a period in the 
history of the world when man in certain eras lifted 
himself above merely animal existence and through the 
power of his mind established a new order of life which 
we are pleased to call civilized life. That in doing that 
with whatever other discoveries he may have made, and 
it was a discovery indeed, he revealed the secret of vigo- 
rous power of thought, and at the same time developed 
a language to express the forms of that thought. 
Whatever we may say, ladies and gentlemen, ours is 
the civilization that has come directly from that original 
civilization of Greece and Rome. We have, it is true, 
inherited the content of the Hebraic civilization, but not 
the forms of Hebraic thought, because we have never 
accustomed ourselves enough to the Hebrew thought to
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  40 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
understand its forms to any great extent—its language. 
But with Latin and Greek it is different: we have stud- 
ied the language, and in coming in contact with the 
original language we come in contact with those origi- 
nal forms of thought that have made our civilization 
possible. It is absolutely absurd to say they are out of 
date—because they have no time value; and they have 
no time value because they have a value for all time. 
These forms of thought, in the very language of Greece 
and of Rome, have a universal significance; they do not 
apply to any age; they have no geographical limita- 
tions; they are the forms that we are following (uncon- 
sciously it may be to ourselves) in every thoughtful 
enterprise in which we are engaged. 
There can be no inherent opposition between such 
forms of thought and applied science. For instance, 
in our day the very men who are making the inventions, 
who are making the discoveries in all the fields of 
science, are using those great fundamental forms of 
thought which characterize our particular civilization— 
the western civilization—and they are the forms of 
thought that were discovered in that early age and dis- 
covered for all time and handed down as our particular 
inheritance. 
Therefore we believe that our young women and our 
young men should come in contact with these forms of 
thought embodied in the very language which first gave 
them birth. The great plea in scholarly and scientific 
research is, Back, back to the source; do not drink of 
the stream as it passes before you, but follow it up to 
the fountain head in the great hills where it has its rise. 
There, in the original stream, is the life giving draught. 
I do not know, ladies and gentlemen, how I can better

strike the key note of all the exercises of this morning 
and this afternoon than to conclude with the words 
which have come to us to-day from across the sea: 
London, May 81. 
Rejoice to hear energetic efforts being made in 
America to vindicate place of classical studies. Modern 
world needs ancient writings as much as ever, not only 
because they furnish perpetual delight as models of 
style but also because by their very unlikeness to mod- 
ern conditions they touch imagination, stimulate 
thought, enlarge our view of man and nature. They 
enter into and have done much to instill what is best in 
modern literature and are the common heritage of civi- 
lized peoples, the permanent foundation on which the 
republic of letters has been built. Save them for pos- 
terity. Bryce. :

I am profoundly interested in the Conference on 
Classical Studies in Liberal Education to be held at 
Princeton University on Saturday, June 2. Were it 
not that the date falls at our own commencement sea- 
son, I should certainly wish to be present to testify to 
my personal indebtedness to the study of the classics 
and to my strong conviction as to their supreme impor- 
tance as elements and instruments of a liberal educa- 
tion. There is no higher duty resting upon us than to 
maintain these studies and constantly to improve them. |
-P-A-G-E-50
  42 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
Their loss to our secondary and higher education would 
be an irreparable disaster at any time, but never more 
so than now when these studies are the only existing 
natural and common international basis for the study of 
the fundamental literary and philosophical elements in 
our western civilization. 
Education truly conceived is spiritual growth toward 
intellectual and moral perfection, and it is not an arti- 
ficial process to be carried on according to mechanical 
formulas toward a purely material end. ‘There are 
utilities higher and utilities lower, and if the school in 
its zeal to fit the youth for self-support were to neglect 
to lay the foundation for that higher intellectual and 
spiritual life which constitutes humanity’s full stature, 
it would sacrifice the higher utilities to the lower. 
The decline in the number of those American stu- 
dents who study Greek and Latin and who have a rea- 
sonable familiarity with the history and literature of 
Greece and Rome is greatly to be deplored. No educa- 
tional substitute for Greek and Latin has ever been 
found, and none will be found so long as our present 
civilization endures, for the simple reason that to study 
Greek and Latin under wise and inspiring guidance is 
to study the embryology of the civilization which we 
call Kuropean and American. In every other field of 
inquiry having to do with living things, the study of 
embryology is strongly emphasized and highly esteemed. 
What is now being attempted all over this country is 
to train youth in a comprehension of a civilization which 
has historic and easily examined roots, without reveal- 
ing to them the fact, and often without even under- 
standing the fact, that modern civilization has roots. 
Phrase making, scattered and unrelated information
-P-A-G-E-51
ADDRESSES 43 
and vague aspirations for the improvement of other 
people are, unfortunately, now supposed to be a satis- 
factory substitute for an understanding of how civili- 
zation came to be what it is. It so happens, too, that in 
the embryonic period of our civilization, man’s intel- 
lectual and aesthetic achievements were on a remark- 
able scale of excellence. These achievements rightly 
became the standard of judgment and of taste for those 
generations and centuries that followed. When we turn 
aside from the study of Greek and Latin, therefore, we 
not only give up the study of the embryology of civili- 
zation but we lose the great advantage which follows 
from intimate association with some of the highest forms 
of intellectual and aesthetic achievement. 
Conditions that now exist lay a heavy burden upon 
teachers of the ancient classics. Unless Greek and 
Latin are to become museum pieces, those who teach 
them must catch and transmit more of the real spirit 
and meaning of the classics than they have too often 
been in the habit of doing. Well taught, Latin and 
Greek have long since established themselves as of the 
first intellectual value both in school and in college and 
in the practical work of life. . Let him who wishes to see 
classical knowledge in action read any one of a hundred 
passages in Morley’s Life of Gladstone, or any one of 
a score of pages in the Life of his one-time colleague, 
Robert Lowe, Viscount Sherbrooke, or the Life and 
Letters of Benjamin Jowett, Master of Balliol. 
Forty-four years ago I began, in stumbling fashion 
and not under the best auspices, the study of Latin and 
Greek. From that day to this my acquaintance, im- 
perfect as it is, with the languages, the literatures and 
the civilizations of Greece and Rome has been a source

of increasing intellectual satisfaction and a help 
often a guiding, companion, in every form of public

private activity in which I have engaged. A firm grasp 
upon the meaning of Greek and Roman thought and 
institutional life gives new significance to one’s knowl- 
edge of natural science, a deeper meaning to one’s par- 
ticipation in political organization and activity, an a 
sure standard for the determination and appreciation 
of excellence in letters and in art.

It is a significant fact that the schoolmasters of our 
great boarding schools are almost without except 
strongly opposed to the modern tendency in educa: 
which would exalt the practical and abolish that w 
cannot be shown to have a utilitarian value. By the 
called modernist this attitude is attributed to a ae or 
wilful adherence to tradition, to bigoted monastic’ 
and to a studied refusal to welcome radical change 
educational ideals claimed as necessary in order 
education may be made to fit the needs of modern

of discarding worn out ideals and methods and accept- 
ing that which we are assured can alone make ed ica- 
tion effective and worth while has never been made 
clear. There must be some good and sound reason 
our opposition—and there is. 
It is the duty and the privilege of the Sey 
to deal with every side of the embryonic man comm for 
tted 
to his care. Unless he is blind he must recognize that 
   
-P-A-G-E-53
  
ADDRESSES 45 
human nature has at least two sides. The intellectual 
side is ever before him. But there is the moral and 
spiritual as well. Only by the proper blending of these 
different elements in human nature and the studied de- 
velopment and training of each can well rounded and 
vigorous manhood be secured. Only by such all-round 
training shall we develop a human product that is some- 
thing bigger and finer than a mere piece of mechanism 
designed to fit into a place in a practical world but de- 
void of aspiration and idealism, bereft of vision and 
imagination, forever denied the privilege of tasting the 
things of the spirit which alone is life. Well may 
thoughtful schoolmasters, dealing with youthful aspi- 
rations and potentialities, shudder at the prospect of an 
education that is essentially a denial of all that is finest 
and noblest in human nature. 
Our modernists will doubtless deny that such caustic 
criticism is justified. But if close observation of some 
five thousand American youth furnishes any fair basis 
of judgment, I have no hesitation in saying that such 
criticism is none too severe, and that the dangers that 
lurk beneath the modern scheme may well arouse our 
deepest apprehension and call us forth to battle with 
all our might against proposals that threaten to under- 
mine if not destroy the very foundations of true edu- 
cation. 
What the modernist proposes in brief is this: that 
practical subjects shall dominate if not actually make 
up our curriculum; that the interest of individual youth 
shall be the starting point and guiding principle of our. 
labors and that subjects or subject matter not attractive 
per se shall be largely abolished; that the idea that there 
exists such a thing as mental training or mental disci-  
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
pline shall be forever discarded; that the history and lit- 
erature of past ages shall become a closed book to our 
children save as isolated facts may interest or be made 
to serve a practical end; that the coming generation in 
fact shall be granted no fair opportunity to know that 
human nature through all ages has been human nature 
still, wrestling with eternal human problems, inspired 
by eternal human hopes and aspirations, progressi 
just in so far as it has caught and for a moment held 
spiritual visions and has grasped and mastered eternal 
truths. All this and much more the modernist would 
deny our children that they may be made more efficient 
in a temporarily practical world. 
If man is still a partaker of the spiritual nature—and 
who of us will dare deny it—the cravings of that spirit- 
ual nature must still be satisfied. If modern hi 
kind alone are not to run contrary to all the teachings 
of history and nature, rugged character, and intellect 
too, must be tested and developed under conditions that 
call for hard and at times distasteful effort. If the ex- 
periences of every day life are not to be wilfully ig- 
nored we must continue to recognize the truth that 
youthful “interest” is seldom a safe guide and may and 
often does point the road to weakness and disaster. 
And finally, if youth is to emerge successfully from its 
hard and constant struggle against the mighty forces 
that seek to undermine its strength and cloud its higher 
vision it must be fortified and inspired by the example 
of those who through the passing ages have fought its 
fights, have dreamed its dreams, and have won its vic- 
tories. As a basis for the accomplishment of these de- 
sirable ends nothing has yet been offered us that can 
properly supplant a broad classical foundation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  
ADDRESSES at 
Whatever its faults, the old education has sought for 
its followers a higher than a practical goal. Without 
denying the value of the practical it has recognized in 
every youth the presence of the spiritual, and it has 
sought to call that vital element in human nature into 
a larger and fuller expression; to lift humanity above 
the commonplace into the realm of ideas and ideals, and 
to satisfy, or at least point the way to satisfaction to 
hungry human souls. Deny the reality of this realm of 
the spiritual in human life and you deprive mankind of 
every incentive to virtue, to justice, to chivalry, to 
heroism, to sacrifice—of all those things of the spirit 
which through all ages men have valued more highly 
than things material, have counted more precious even 
than life. Banish from our schools today the necessity 
and privilege of dealing with the spiritual nature and 
you rob us of all that is finest and most inspiring in our 
work; all that prompts to devotion and sacrifice; all that 
to any high minded and earnest schoolmaster makes his 
work the noblest of all professions, the highest of all 
human callings. ; 
‘Scenting this modern tendency now running riot in 
our educational world Emerson, years ago, sounded a 
note of protest and alarm. “Let us not forget,” he 
said, “that the adoption of the test ‘what is it good for’ 
would abolish the rose and exalt in triumph the cab- 
bage.” God spare us from the day when a sordid ma- 
terialistic gluttony shall leave us no room for or no 
appreciation of the beauty, the fragrance, and the in- 
spiration of the things of the spirit.

It is a bit humiliating to those who had thought the 
law a learned profession to hear a lawyer of high stand- 
ing at the bar say gravely to the highest court of the 
land: “Your Honors, this is a proceeding in rem and 
the rem is before the court.” ‘True, the substance is 
more important than the form, and if one or the other 
must be neglected no doubt it should be the form. t 
something more is involved. One whose training has 
been so defective as to allow him to overlook the dif- 
ference between a nominative and an accusative is not 
unlikely to overlook other matters which do not lie sab 
the surface of things—and it is the business of the law- 
yer not to overlook anything that may bear upon the 
affair in hand. 
It is not merely the obvious need of study of Latin 
in order to understand law Latin, and the Latin maxims 
and phrases of which the books are full, that leads 
teachers of law to insist upon the importance of classi- 
cal training. It is the lawyer’s every day business 
only to reason soundly but to express his ideas clearly 
and accurately; to make what he has put on paper so 
clear and so definite as to convey his precise meaning to 
disputants “fired with zeal to pervert” and thus to fore- 
stall controversy. It has been said that a great deal of 
bad law is simply bad English. In like manner a great 
deal of bad law making, a great deal of bad pleading, 
and a great deal of bad conveyancing is simply bad 
English, in the sense that the writer has failed to form- 
ulate accurately what he had in mind and to express it    
  
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  ADDRESSES 49 
with precision. Language is the instrument of thought 
as well as the medium by which thought is preserved, 
and one whose philological instincts are undeveloped is 
not likely to think critically nor to express his conclu- 
sions exactly. 
There is no better way for the student to train him- 
self in the choice of the very word that will fit his 
thought than by translation from Latin and Greek. 
Thus he develops habits of analysis, habits of discrimi- 
nating choice of words, habits of accurate apprehension 
of the meaning which another has sought to convey by 
written words, which lead to power of expression and to 
power of clear thinking. Such habits are worth more 
to the lawyer than all the information which a modern 
school may hope to impart. 
In arranging the professional curriculum we have 
constantly to combat the fallacy that no one is bound to 
know anything unless he has had a formal “course” in 
it; that every nook and corner of the law must be ex- 
plored for detailed information with the aid of a teacher 
in order to prepare the student for the bar. In con- 
trast the academic law school seeks to train a body of 
men who have so mastered the art of legal reasoning, 
and have so solid a foundation in legal science, that they 
may approach new problems in new fields and old prob- 
lems in unfamiliar fields with assurance and may achieve 
results of real value. The same fallacy underlies cur- 
rent ideas of preparation for study of the law. It is 
said that there is so much to learn in the lawyer’s special 
field that specialization for that vocation must begin a 
long way back; that many things which he ought to 
know must find a place in his preliminary training or be 
forever neglected. Hence, history, economics, the so-

cial and political sciences, and one might say equally, 
the physical and the natural sciences—“things that he 
can use”—are to replace the classics completely. But 
what he will use chiefly is his mind. The best founda- 
tion for professional training is mental habits formed 
in school and college. The requisite habits are not 
formed by special courses in everything that a lawyer 
needs to know. 
Mr. Justice Holmes has said that it is the business of 
law schools to teach law in the grand manner. The so- 
cial demand is not for acute legal tradesmen, but for 
_ great lawyers who will be useful to society as well as 
successful in their practice. The call is for something 
more than men who know their books of practice and 
their reports. It is for cultivated men who have been 
taught to use these books as means, and have the trained 
minds, the imagination and the ideals to employ these 
means for great ends. No one need wonder that the 
legal profession has come to be somewhat discredited in 
a time when the education in the humanities that made 
the great lawyers of the past has become discredited in 
the profession itself; when, as a great judge has put it, 
“there comes from the bar the new gospel that learning 
is out of date, and that the man for the times is no 
longer the thinker and the scholar, but the smart man 
unencumbered with other artillery than the latest edi- 
tion of the Digests and the latest revision of the Stat- 
utes.” ‘The law has been made an instrument of justice 
by men trained in the humanities like Lord Mansfield 
and Lord Selborne, not by men of exclusively profes- 
sional education like Lord Kenyon and Lord St. Leon- 
ards. 
And so the teacher of law prays for students of good

verify and discard a series of working hypotheses as 
those must who translate Latin and Greek at sight, who 
can see the relations of word to word, and can perceive 
that two and two make four and say so accurately, in-

Of liberal education Medicine may have some right 
to speak, for she has demanded it as a prerequisite of 
those who are to enter the medical profession; and medi- 
cal men, coming as they do into close contact with the 
lives of all sorts and conditions of men, have excellent 
opportunities to observe the effects of different kinds of 
education upon human life. It is now generally admit- 
ted that an education to be liberal must include natural 
science on the one hand and language, literature and 
history on the other—knowledge of the world around 
us and knowledge of human life, of man’s capacities and 
ideals, of his longings and achievements, of his political 
theories and social aims, of his appreciations of the 
beautiful, and of his systems of faith and worship. Now 
physicians, from the time of Hippocrates on, have 
known how to value a knowledge of things as well as a 
knowledge of words. When classical studies were pre- 
dominant in education, natural science being neglected, 
medicine held up the hands of those who urged the ob- 
jective study of external nature, though it was, it is true, 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  52 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
a great humanist, Scaliger, who, in the sixteenth cen- 
tury, in a letter to a physician, Jerome Cardan, most 
concisely expressed the idea of “a true cognition of the 
things (or objects) themselves, taken directly from the 
things themselves.”* It is not probable, I think, that 
medical men will ever favor neglect of the “discipline 
of things” to the injury of education. At present some 
of us in medicine feel that education is in danger of be- 
coming illiberal in the other direction, first, because 
schools are growing remiss about humanistic rather than 
about physical subjects and, secondly, because of the 
tendency in the colleges to displace liberal by vocational 
education. A protest seems due against the unwise sub- 
ordination, in the curriculum of liberal studies, of lan- 
guage, literature, history and philosophy. If these sub- 
jects, which are fully as important for the welfare of 
individuals and nations as are the physical sciences, 
were to be neglected, all human progress would be en- 
dangered, and medicine as well as other sciences would 
suffer. Furthermore, in our desire to be “practical,” to 
be “efficient,” to be “modern,” we must take care not to 
become narrow minded and materialistic, not to become 
unimaginative and unsympathetic, not to sacrifice a 
greater good that is remote by striving too eagerly after 
a lesser good that seems near. Science and thought have 
been created by men who desired to know, not in order 
to make money, not in order to become famous, but 
simply that they might know. Let us not forget the 
old maxim that “to seek utility everywhere is most un- 
suitable to lofty and free natures.” To be liberally 
educated a man must have gained a belief in the value 
of knowledge, have learned the methods by which true

knowledge is acquired, and have applied these methods 
in his studies of nature and of man. 
The idea of evolution, which we owe to science, is a 
conception so fruitful that today we regard any study as 
superficial that does not include an examination of de- 
velopment and of origins. Even in our professional 
curricula, genetic studies dare not be ignored. The 
modern medical student must study not only the an- 
atomy of the adult human body but also its embryology. 
To understand what we see, we must know how it has 
come to be. Thus appreciative of the study of sources, 
men of science should be the last to undervalue the study 
of antiquity. For just as modern religions are largely 
traceable to the ancient religions of the Hebrews, the 
Greeks and the Hindus, so the languages, the literature, 
the politics, the laws and the philosophy of our times 
are descendants of those of the ancient world. To un- 
derstand what we say, hear, read, think, feel and do in 
America today, it is of help to know what was said, 
written, thought, felt and done when human life was 
less complex than it is now. In this connection a knowl- 
edge of the civilizations of Greece and Rome is, above 
all, of aid, for it is upon them, in the main, that our 
own social development is based. Thus from Greece 
we have inherited our literary forms, the key thoughts 
of our intellectual life, and the artistic creations that 
determine our standards for the discernment and en- 
joyment of beauty and other excellence; and from 
Rome we have derived many of our ideas of law, of 
order, of organization, of administration and of states- 
manship. To Greece and Rome together, then, we are 
very largely indebted for the foundations of our intel- 
lectual life and of our personal and national character.

  54 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
The study of antiquity and of the streams of influence 
that flow down from it to our own times is, therefore, 
an essential part of an education that may be called 
liberal. 
Though much of the knowledge of the ancient world 
referred to can be obtained from courses in the classics 
independent of the study of the Latin and Greek lan- 
guages, I am convinced that the time and energy spent 
in learning these languages by young persons who have 
capacity for language study will be very profitably em- 
ployed, provided the curriculum is wisely constructed 
and the teaching is done by men of mind who know 
how to appeal to the mind. Of course no one desires 
to support bad teaching of the classical languages, or 
teaching that is repulsive to students and disappointing 
in the results it yields. No one, today, favors a pre- 
dominantly classical education that excludes the teach- 
ing of our own and other modern languages, modern 
literature, modern history, and the sciences of nature. 
Nor does anyone wish to swamp the time table of our 
schools with classical courses so as to cripple the teach- 
ing in non-classical subjects. The danger in this coun- 
try is quite in the opposite direction. Undoubtedly, the 
study of the classical languages, especially of Latin, is 
of value in helping one to learn to think and to express 
one’s self clearly and precisely in his own tongue. It 
makes, too, the study of French, Italian and Spanish a 
very simple task. Acquaintance with Latin grammar, 
because of its exactness and of the variety of its forms, 
makes the understanding of the grammar of English 
and of a number of other languages easy. Further, a 
large part of our English vocabulary has been directly 
derived from Latin and Greek sources, another part in-
-P-A-G-E-63
ADDRESSES 55 
directly from them through the Romance languages. 
‘What a short cut to the meaning of English words a 
knowledge of suffixes, of affixes and of roots affords! 
This is true even of the vocabulary of ordinary life, but 
when we recall the terminology of the sciences, especial- 
ly of medicine, we must regard Latin and Greek as 
actually vocational subjects for the study of science and 
for the prospective doctor of medicine. Many a physi- 
cian who entered medicine, as I did, with “little Latin 
and less Greek” regrets that he had not more. I would 
urge every young person looking forward to medicine 
as a career to devote some time to classical studies. In- 
deed, I shall go farther and say that a total inaptitude 
for the study of Latin and Greek should make one 
gravely question his fitness for a medical career. Some 
men, it is true, have achieved success in medicine with- 
out any study of either Latin or Greek. But a knowl- 
edge of the classics will give a man a larger chance of 
success than he could otherwise have. The physician 
who has gained the culture and the mental training that 
result from a study of the literature and the history of 
Greece and Rome is less likely to have a narrow view of 
life, to be vulgar, to be indiscriminative, to be vacuous, 
or to be unsympathetic than he would have been without 
these advantages. If his studies have been thorough, he 
will have done much toward avoiding the plight of Alci- 
biades, who had to confess to Socrates that he had “ne- 
glected the needs of his soul.” Perhaps, too, he will 
have caught a little of the spirit that Aphrodite, “the 
Cyprian,” was to bring to the Athenians, “a spirit of 
wisdom, of passion and of excellence.”

Education has been defined as the development and 
modification of behavior through experience. Animal 
behavior is determined by the nature and training of the 
nervous system. This is the machine which must be put 
into operation, and man surpasses other animals in the 
excellence and capabilities which he possesses in these 
directions. ‘Systematic education should begin with the 
training of the five senses because it is through these 
avenues only that we acquire knowledge. Through 
them, the cells of the brain cortex are brought into re- 
lation with the non-ego. This connection with the outer 
world is made in the infant soon after birth and its 
training and development constitute the basis of all 
education. It is desirable that perceptions should be 
accurate to the finest detail, that the impressions made 
upon the brain should be sharply defined and so firmly 
fixed that they may be retained and reviewed in the 
future and that they should be properly correlated, so 
that their relationship may be correctly determined. 
To the extent that these conditions are fulfilled, accu- 
racy of perception, reliability of memory and sound- 
ness of judgment are secured. These are the funda- 
mental principles in all mental development. Defect at 
any step of the process disturbs the whole and lessens 
the value of the final product. Faulty observation leads 
to inaccuracies in memory pictures and errors in judg- 
ment. The nervous mechanism of man is in no indi-
-P-A-G-E-65

ADDRESSES 57 
vidual so perfectly developed that he escapes error in 
all his mental processes or reaches perfection in any. 
The purpose of education is to reduce these defects and 
to improve mental processes so far as possible, and suc- 
cess is limited by the natural talent and adaptability of 
the student. 
Since the avenues in which mental training may be 
directed are unlimited, and since diversity of learning is 
desirable and beneficial, it seems evident that educa- 
tional lines should be multiple and lead to all points of 
the compass. It is not a matter of regret to me that 
the old time classical curriculum is no longer obligatory 
on all college men, but it is a matter of regret that the 
study of Greek and Latin is now so generally neglected. 
It is the purpose of this brief paper to point out some 
advantages to medical students in the study of these 
dead languages. 
One cannot be a thorough student of any subject 
| without giving close attention to detail, and the inflec- 
tions of noun, verb and adjective in Greek and Latin 
render this necessary.. Moreover with the close atten- 
tion that the student must give to variations in the 
structure of words he soon perceives that these indicate 
variations in shade of meaning and then the joy of study 
takes possession and leads to enthusiasm. Observation 
is sharpened, perception becomes more delicate, and the 
student finds an increased pleasure in the intensity with 
which he seeks to interpret the author’s meaning fully 
and correctly. This habit of close observation, of atten- 
tion to detail, of looking for fine distinctions and shades 
of difference, and the alertness of mind awakened in an 
individual by these habits, prove of inestimable service 
to him both in his experimental work in his laboratory 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
ES err ne eer Ser PE teen te ere a 
58 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
and at the bedside of his patient when he becomes a 
scientific medical man. Indeed, the progress of medi- 
cine is determined largely by the accuracy and precision 
with which observations are made. The careless or the 
superficial man is not suited either to the practice of 
medicine or to the conduct of experiments for the eluci- 
dation of medical problems. It is the painter who 
brings out detail, and not the impressionist, who is 
needed in scientific medicine. William Harvey, whose 
keenness for investigation and accuracy of observation 
led to the discovery of the circulation of the blood, after 
many years devoted to the study of the classics, gave 
five to the study of medicine, and the fitness of his prep- 
aration was demonstrated by his work. I do not claim 
that the qualities of close and careful observation can be 
attained only by the study of the classics and still less 
am I prepared to hold that all who study the classics 
attain these qualities. But I do hold that carelessness 
and superficiality are incompatible with the thorough 
study of Latin and Greek. The pursuit of any study 
without close attention and accuracy of observation has 
but little disciplinary value, and failure to secure these 
essentials is more frequently the fault of the teacher 
than of the pupil. | 
The practical value of Greek and Latin, as aids to 
the exact meaning of scientific terms, as shown by their 
derivations, is denied by no one. But some claim that 
the giving of from four to six years, or even more, to 
the digging of Greek roots and the trimming of Latin 
stems is too big a price to pay for the result. Possibly 
this is true if the student gets nothing but a knowledge 
of etymology from his classical studies and if the time 
and energy given to the classics are so excessive that he
-P-A-G-E-67
    ADDRESSES 59 
cannot seek knowledge in other fields. The fundamen- 
tal training of every one who aspires to be listed among 
the educated should be broad, and I have elsewhere 
(“The Nature and Purpose of Education”) given my 
conception of what it should cover. In an experience of 
more than forty years as a teacher of medical students I 
easily distinguish among my auditors those who know 
Greek and those who do not, especially when I use 
scientific terms, such as a “toxicogenic bacillus” or a 
“pathognomonic symptom.” I see the eyes of the for- 
mer fill with the light of comprehension, while those of 
the latter are closed in ignorance and mystification. 
Constant consultation of the best dictionaries (a habit 
seldom acquired by medical students) fails to supplant 
the defect in preliminary education. 
It is claimed by some that the use of Latin names in 
medicine and generally in science is pure affectation and 
should be discontinued. This statement could be made 
only by one grossly ignorant of the facts. The word 
“salt” may mean any one of a thousand compounds, but 
“Sodii chloridum” and “Magnesii sulphas” are definite 
and capable of only one interpretation, be the reader 
English, French, Italian, Russian, Spanish or German. 
Common names of plants and animals vary in different 
sections of the same country, while the scientific desig- 
nation is the same the world over. The language em- 
ployed by an exact science like chemistry, botany or 
bacteriology must be one which has already crystallized, 
and not one which means one thing today and may have 
quite another meaning a year from now, or even a cen- 
tury in the future. We must not forget, even in the 
pursuit of the rapidly growing modern sciences, that 
there is a biology of language and that it like every-
-P-A-G-E-68
60 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
thing else mundane comes into existence, goes through 
a process of evolution, suffers modifications from its en- 
vironment, and does not crystallize into exactness until 
it is no longer used orally; and not until this period is 
reached and it is no longer subject to modification, does 
it become the suitable form for exact, scientific expres- 
sion.

It is my privilege to outline, as best I may, the rela- 
tions of biology and biologists to the classics. 
In naming plants and animals, in systems of classi- 
fication—and for parts of the body—biologists use 
Latin and Greek as a lingua franca. It is true that 
when left to their own devices they sometimes produce 
monstrous names—but the more cautious among them 
usually invite a classical colleague to be present at the 
christening. It is the safer plan. Doubtless there was 
some classical literature on biology—but very little of 
it has been preserved. Aristotle’s “History of Ani- 
mals” is a conspicuous example of the best. It is inter- 
esting reading though entirely descriptive, yet some of 
the observations are remarkably close. 
For the biologist then we may say that the content of 
the classics is small and that his use of the languages is 
for the most part limited to a nomenclature which is 
purely technical. 
To be sure those fortunate enough to have acquired
-P-A-G-E-69
ADDRESSES 61 
an easy reading knowledge of Greek or Latin, or of 
both, have access to a mass of literature closed to the 
majority. Nevertheless the best of the ancient writings 
are to be found in some modern language and are open 
to us all. 
From the side of biology, the science, therefore, it is 
possible to make but a slender argument for the teach- 
ing of ancient languages to youth in general. 
If now we turn to the biologist, the man, who must 
perforce transcend the limitations of his science, the 
case is altered. The broader concepts with which the 
biologist deals are often very ancient and, like other men 
of science, he is called upon to use some rather compre- 
hensive ideas. He recognizes that while knowledge has 
grown and beliefs have changed in the course of the cen- 
turies, the method of handling ideas, our logic, is much 
the same. The history of ideas and the formation of be- 
liefs are therefore to him matters of importance for the 
interpretation of modern thought, best made when its 
development is understood. 
It is worth noting perhaps that biologically speaking 
we are very close to our classic past. If we call it 2500 
years from now till then, it follows that only twenty-five 
human lives, twenty-five centenarians holding hands are 
needed to bridge the gap, while from seventy-five to one 
hundred generations are all that separate us here from 
the fellow citizens of Solon. From the standpoint of the 
stock-breeder the interval is trifling. To neglect these 
forerunners and their times would seem almost like 
showing disrespect to the elders of the family, for to 
these and to their times we can trace the beginnings of 
our peculiar literature, philosophy and art. These things 
are the great heritage of western Europe and her colo-
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
nies, and the man who would contemplate the thought of 
today must view it against the background of antiquity. 
That background must be preserved to us and there 
should be those set apart to illuminate and to interpret 
it. This has always been the function of the classicists, 
the men of broad culture, and to-day when intellectual 
interests are diversified as never before, the need for 
such scholars is even greater than in times gone by. 
The effective specialist of to-day is no longer a man who 
aims at intellectual aloofness, but on the contrary is one 
who seeks to focus on his special problem the wisdom of 
the world. Nothing is alien to him, not even such things 
as lie outside the intellectual realm. It is in the field of 
literature, where the classic models are found, that we 
make contact with the various forms of the emotions and 
the aesthetic feelings—a contact needed for the expan- 
sion of any normal soul. 
In biology to be sure the expression of the emotions 
tends to appear most strongly in controversial litera- 
ture—but the nature lover is not unknown and the 
aesthetic feelings play a much larger part than one 
might suspect, for beauty is rarely missed, even in the 
laboratory. 
To be worth while, a discussion such as this requires 
that we arrive at some sort of conclusion—even though 
a very general one. 
Considerations familiar to most of us make it very 
evident that there is no panacea which can be used in 
the art of education any more than in the art of medi- 
cine. Each individual calls for special treatment. It 
is certain too that there always will be those to whom 
the wisdom, the beauties and the historic associations of 
the ancient masterpieces will appeal, and who as stu-
-P-A-G-E-71
  ADDRESSES 63 
dents prefer the classic field—but it is just as certain 
that there will always be others to whom the natural 
sciences are of absorbing interest. The relative num- 
bers in these two groups have no bearing on our argu- 
ment. For the natural science group Latin as an aid 
to the comprehension of their own language and those 
of the Romance family is indicated, but I would not 
confuse the teaching of Latin for this purpose with a 
cultivation of the classics. 
For this great work we must depend on those who 
are or would be masters of the ancient learning, and 
whose significance and dignity in the university world 
protects them from the dust of passing gusts. The 
biologists most certainly need such colleagues and both 
have their place on the faculty of any university pre- 
senting a curriculum by which the real needs of every 
student can be met.

Editor of Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, New York City 
The American is temperamentally disposed to look 
for “short cuts.” In chemistry this exhibits itself in the 
desire for early specialization, at the necessary sacrifice 
of well rounded undergraduate training. Recently I 
was asked by a man, blessed with an abundance of 
worldly goods, whose son expected to enter college in a 
few months—“Is it best for my boy to specialize in 
physical, organic or inorganic chemistry?” He seemed 
surprised at the answer—‘“Give the boy a sound and 
   
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
broad education and the matter of specialization will 
take care of itself.” 
In such preliminary education surely the classics 
should play an important part if for no other reason 
than that thereby clarity of expression is assured. A 
brief editorial experience has shown too well how often 
inability to write correctly is accompanied by or perhaps 
is the evidence of inability to think correctly. It would 
be interesting to trace the character of the training 
which constituted the ground work in such cases. 
To the young man looking forward to chemistry as a 
profession, the patient and thorough drill of courses in 
the classics is too often irritating and seemingly a waste 
of time. He is forgetful of the mental gymnastics 
whose prototype in physical development he so willing- 
ly recognizes; he fails to realize that the day is coming 
when, for the solution of some important problem for 
which he is responsible, he will need an elastic thinking 
power, qualified to hold fast to essentials and to cast 
aside non-essentials; he will have to think true, to reason 
accurately; and, with all these well done, he will have 
to prepare a report either for the scientific journals or 
for a Board of Directors, and upon its writing he will 
be judged. It is worth the struggle of the earlier years 
to make that showing all that it should be. 
There is another side, however. We call for classical 
training; and yet we do so almost, in despair. It is a 
fact that the young men who undertake to study chem- 
istry are in large measure inadequately prepared in the 
graces of expression. Many of them are lacking in 
good taste. How to establish it in a fallow mind is a 
question that men of science do not know how to answer. 
Unfortunately an arts degree is no sufficient guarantee
-P-A-G-E-73
  
ADDRESSES 65 
of it. Very often home training in an atmosphere of 
general culture will provide it, with no more background 
than a course of training at a secondary school. I think 
it fair to state that when a knowledge of human reac- 
tions is gathered from the study of the classics the train- 
ing may be said to be good, but whenever the classics are 
taught as so much punishment at hard labor, teachers 
of chemistry find no advantage in such work. 
Unfortunately it is not given to us to select our stu- 
dents, we must take those that come to us. We want 
them to be whole men, and when they are not we can 
do no better than scold; which is usually to no effect 
and is without profit to anyone. Nevertheless, when we 
consider the many students that have passed before us 
in review, the outline of the effect of the classics comes 
before us. It is not necessary here to speak of the intel- 
lectual pleasures which arise from daily habitation of the 
atmosphere of thoughts of the great masters of the past, 
or of the broadened sympathies toward mankind result- 
ing from an intimate knowledge of the literature of the 
past. I do, however, gladly bear testimony to the fact 
that after many years of teaching chemistry the record 
of attainments of those who have worked with me points 
clearly to the fact that, taken as groups, the young men 
who specialized in chemistry after completing under- 
graduate courses including much Latin and Greek are 
they who have eventually risen highest. 
If we are to rise above mediocrity in our scientific 
work, surely it must be upon the solid foundation of a 
broad and liberal education which will give us men pos- 
sessed of lively imaginations, clarity of thought, grace 
in expression and souls imbued with deepest sympathy 
for the human race in all its struggles upward.

Mr. Lecky, the historian, says somewhere that in an 
ideal state of society provision will be made that every 
child shall have an opportunity to develop the best that 
is in him, and to receive a training in those lines where 
he can best serve his kind. Of course, it need not be 
mentioned that we are very far from such an ideal state 
of development as that. For most of us and for most 
of our children, who are not content merely to be a 
cog in the industrial machine, education has to be a 
compromise between the training for making a living 
and the training for making that living worth while af- 
ter it has been made. ; 
It is upon this second point that I wish to lay stress. 
Of course, there is a great deal to be said and much has 
been said about the purely vocational value of good 
training in Latin and Greek, and I may add my own 
testimony and experience to that. For thirty-seven 
years now, I have been teaching geology here, and my 
experience is personally like that of many other teach- 
ers of science that, taken as a group, and of course with 
individual exceptions, the men who do best are those who 
have had a broad, thorough training in Latin and 
Greek. I found the same true in Germany. I had the 
great privilege of being the pupil in Heidelberg of 
Carl Gegenbaur, and he said to me one day, “When a 
new batch of students enters my dissecting room it does 
not take me more than half an hour to tell the gymnasia
-P-A-G-E-75
  ADDRESSES 67 
men who studied the classics from those who have not 
studied them, because of the incontestable superiority of 
the former.” 
Of course, it is true that such testimony is by no 
means conclusive. There are all sorts of complicated 
factors involved in that question—the question, for in- 
stance, of a boy’s social environment, so that the best 
boys are given a-classical training. We have a large 
body of testimony to the effect that the ideal training 
for men who are going to make science their profession 
is the old fashioned one which is now so generally called 
into question. But that is not the point to which I 
would refer particularly. 
Has it ever occurred to you that these ultra-modern 
ideas on education are really a return to barbaric and 
savage methods? The only idea in training the young 
man in a red Indian camp is to make a good hunter and 
good warrior out of him: that is vocational training. 
The ancient Persians had an education for which a great 
deal may be said: to ride, shoot and speak the truth. 
That speaking the truth represents the ideal side of 
their education. What is your living going to be worth 
when you make it? The vocational training is one 
which says that the entire building consists of the foun- 
dation. The real value of an education is to make a 
man, not merely to make a useful engineer or school 
teacher or what not but to develop the best that is in him 
and to. make his life worth while to himself and all the 
community in which he lives. Now it is that aspect of 
the case which I think deserves the fullest consideration 
and emphasis, more particularly now because of this 
terrible catastrophe of war upon us and upon the whole 
civilized world.
-P-A-G-E-76
  68 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
With the terrible slaughter that has gone on, we find 
a great depletion in the ranks of schools, and when this 
war is over and the great reconstruction comes about or 
is undertaken, the cry for efficiency is going to be louder 
than ever—trained men to reconstruct. That is all 
right—very necessary. But is that all? Will our task 
be accomplished when the ruined houses and churches 
have been rebuilt; or is it not vitally essential that we 
shall transmit the torch to our descendants; that in this 
awful hurricane we shall shelter that torch to prevent 
its being blown out? 
For all the purposes of intellectual enjoyment every- 
thing depends upon background. What does one’s 
reading suggest? Is it merely the literal meaning of 
the words, or are pictures called up by allusion and 
metaphor, rich in significance and beauty? That is the 
difference between a cultivated and an uncultivated 
man. However good an engineer or lawyer he may be, 
it is that background which more than anything else 
enriches the mental life and adds to the joy of living— 
and that alone can be obtained from the study of the 
classics. 
Barrie says somewhere that the only man of the nine- 
teenth century (he said it in the nineteenth century) who 
had anything to say was the scientific man; and he was 
the only man who did not know how to say it. For a very 
good reason, for too exclusively has our scientific man 
been trained in scientific work from the beginning. 
The result is that when he starts to write English he 
often writes a barbarous jargon that is almost unintel- 
ligible. A great deal of the scientific work which is 
done by the scientific bureaus of the Government is 
made all but useless to the man who tries to use it, be-
-P-A-G-E-77
ADDRESSES 69 
cause the writer has never been trained in expression— 
does not know how to use his or any other language. 
The result is confusion thrice confounded. 
It is said of Artemus Ward that he once gave a lec- 
ture in London on Africa, and after an hour’s rambling 
talk about everything but Africa, he said that Africa is 
celebrated for three roses, the red rose, the white rose 
and the negroes. That is about the connection of my re- 
marks with geology. Still, there is a connection. The 
one great lesson that geology has to teach, stated very 
briefly, is the law of continuity. The one lesson we at- 
tempt to impress upon our students is that the history of 
the earth is one of unbroken continuity, in which each 
stage has developed out of the preceding. It is preemi- 
nently the merit of the modern historians to impress 
that same lesson as to the history of mankind. In all 
the history of mankind by far the most significant is that 
of the ancient world—the history of those ancient civi- 
lizations grouped around the Mediterranean. Without 
a comprehensive and sympathetic understanding of 
those civilizations any conception of modern history is 
bound to be defective, because so much of the modern 
world has been directly derived from those Mediterra- 
nean lands and is to this day profoundly influenced by 
them. 
These are just a few random remarks to express the 
reason for the faith that is in me. Nothing more disas- 
trous could happen in the life of the race than for us to 
go back to the pre-Renaissance period when Latin was 
an ecclesiastical study and Greek had been almost for- 
gotten.

Experience and observation during thirty years prac- 
tice as an engineer have convinced me that the study of 
Latin is of great practical value to the young man who 
expects to be an engineer and who possesses sufficient 
innate ability to become in any sense a leader in his pro- 
fession. The same is true also of Greek, although prob- 
ably in less degree. And as regards the effect upon the 
well being of the community, the development of one 
real leader is worth more than that of a hundred—per- 
haps a thousand—ordinary workers. 
Material efficiency is excellent. We need in America 
a vast army of trained artisans, we need competent 
technologists to direct their efforts, and our technologi- 
cal schools are producing these in numbers which ap- 
parently are adequate to meet the demand; but, in gen- 
eral, these men know only mechanism and chemistry, 
and their effectiveness in their profession and as mem- 
bers of society is limited, unless either in their early 
training or later through influences other than those of 
their school days they have established for themselves 
other points of intellectual contact with the world about 
them. And while many such possible points of intel- 
lectual contact are available, there is no other so sugges- 
tive, so refreshing, so stimulating by very contrast, as 
those which touch the lives of men who lived when the 
world was young and which bring to us their thoughts 
recorded with unequalled clarity and charm.

ADDRESSES TL 
I have-no statistics to submit, but I believe it to be 
true that were we to ascertain the facts regarding the 
leaders of the engineering profession in the United 
States today, we should find that a large proportion of 
them either have had some instruction in the classics, or 
by their own efforts through other channels have secured 
for themselves something of that broad view of life and 
thought and experience which is essential to adequate 
perspective, and I am very confident that at least 
seventy-five per cent of these men, if asked in what 
way they could wish their early education had been dif- 
ferent, would indicate their preference for more of cul- 
tural study rather than for more of natural science. 
The engineer who becomes a leader must be competent 
to deal not only with matter and energy, but also with 
men. He must be able to influence other men. He may 
have found the perfect solution of his problem, but be- 
fore he can create the structure which he has conceived, 
or release, direct and utilize any part of the energy of 
the universe, he must convince others, and the man who 
knows only structures, mechanism and the laws of ther- 
mo-dynamics is seriously handicapped. 
To mention a specific reason why the scientist and 
the engineer should be well drilled by competent instruc- 
tors in at least one inflected language, my observation 
has led to the conviction that the systematic and pains- 
taking translation of Latin, for example, is of particu- 
lar value in impressing upon the mind the great impor- 
tance of precision in the expression of a thought. Par- 
ticularly in science and in engineering is it true that the 
best word must be found. Mere approximation is not 
only inadmissible, but often worse than useless. It is 
not sufficient that an engineer’s report be so written that 
 
-P-A-G-E-80
  72 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
it can be understood; it should be so written that it can- 
not be misunderstood. And unquestionably it is a fact 
that inadequate and inaccurate statement is one of the 
most common and serious handicaps of the average 
graduate of a technological school. 
If, from the purely selfish standpoint of its effect 
upon his own career, time spent in studying the classics 
is justified in the case of the student who aims to be- 
come an engineer, by its results in widening his intel- 
lectual horizon, in adding to his all-round efficiency in 
dealing with men, and in teaching him accuracy of ex- 
pression, it is still further justified by its indirect effect 
upon the community as a whole. Few men in this age— 
certainly no engineer—will hesitate to emphasize the 
great value of studies in natural science in training the 
mind. Observation, analysis, inductive reasoning in 
this field are realities to the student. Here he best learns 
to observe closely, to ascertain facts with precision, to 
measure cause and effect, to think quantitatively. But 
the world needs accuracy of observation, precise ascer- 
tainment of facts, correct judgment of cause and effect, 
and quantitative thinking, not only in the laboratory of 
science, but in the forum where public opinion is formed 
and in the hall of legislation. The man who is trained 
in science is rarely a citizen who is easily misled. His 
ability to think straight, to analyze, to foresee results, 
to provide means adequate to attain desired results, 
should be made as effective as possible in the commun- 
ity. To attain his highest efficiency he must express 
himself not only in the theory and practice of his spe- 
cialty, but in doing his part to help in the solution of 
social, economic and political problems. The broader 
his outlook, the greater will be his inclination to assume
-P-A-G-E-81

his proper share of responsibility in these fields of ac- 
tivity, and the more effective his work.

Witiiam Francis Mace 
Former President of American Physical Society 
Professor of Physics and Dean of the Faculty, Princeton University 
My remarks on the value of the study of the classical 
languages will be made from the standpoint of a teacher 
as well as of a student of physics. I am interested in 
the question as to what studies best prepare a man for 
successful work in any one of the physical sciences—the 
so-called exact sciences of earlier days. Of course the 
one fundamental and essential subject in the prepara- 
tion of a physicist is mathematics, first because of the 
universal applicability of mathematics in the develop- 
ment of physics and secondly because of the unique 
value of mathematics for training in the deductive pro- 
cesses which form so large a part of any argument by 
which a physical law or physical theory is established. 
Next to mathematics for early training I rank the clas- 
sical languages. The elementary study of physics or 
chemistry is of no importance in comparison. It is no 
more necessary or advisable to give in school an ele- 
mentary course in physics to a boy who is to become a 
physicist in the future than it is to give in school an 
elementary course in law to a future lawyer or in anat- 
omy to a future surgeon. 
Besides the knowledge of mathematics and training in 
its use the physicist needs mainly training in the use of 
the inductive or scientific method of reasoning. This 
can be obtained in no better way than by the use of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  14 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
grammar and dictionary in the interpretation of the 
meaning of some classical author. There is in the prob- 
lem offered by each sentence of a classical book just the 
admixture of known and unknown, just the combina- 
tion of previous acquisition with the necessity for dis- 
criminating choice among possibilities that is encoun- 
tered in a physical investigation. The student of a 
settled language is exercising all the time the same 
method that he applies to a scientific question. Indeed 
he is engaged in a scientific study. There is no reason 
why we should restrict the term “science” to the study 
of external nature. The mode in which men have ex- 
pressed their thoughts is just as much a subject for 
scientific inquiry as is the mode in which light traverses 
a prism or electricity distributes itself on a conductor. | 
And it is generally true that to a young student human 
thoughts and emotions and language as their vehicle of 
expression are more interesting than the abstract and 
wholly unemotional laws of nature. 
It may be added that training in the classical lan- 
guages leads the student to the consideration of his own 
methods of thought and expression, and promotes ac- 
curacy in argument and precision of statement. If 
this study is carried so far that the student’s taste and 
literary judgment are developed they serve the scien- 
tific man still further. Without going so far as to say, 
as Matthew Arnold seems to say, that truth and false- 
hood can be perceived by the man of culture without 
exact and profound study of the evidence, it may be 
maintained with confidence that even in subjects in 
which the evidence for a proposition is as precise and 
clear as it usually is in physics there is still room and 
large room for the exercise of tact and discrimination

both in the balancing of rival arguments and in the 
statement of one’s own views in such a way as to receive 
consideration and win acceptance.

ABA B. JoHNSON 
President of the Baldwin Locomotive Works, Philadelphia 
Before proceeding to read, I think it is only fair that 
I should state that I am not a graduate of any college, 
but am a graduate of the Central High School of Phil- 
adelphia. Therefore whatever views I shall express 
are those which have been based upon forty years of 
contact with young men, with study of young men who 
have been under my supervision, and a careful analysis 
of the conditions of technical education with reference 
to success in industrial and other forms of life. There- 
fore, you will acquit me at the outset, if you please, of 
approaching the subject with any bias whatever. 
When the Government of the United States had been 
established in place of that of the British Crown, it was 
perceived that the people of any nation governed by the 
popular will must have sufficient education to create 
sound public opinion upon subjects of national impor- 
tance. The first test of education is the creation of an 
intelligent citizenship, inspired by love of country, by 
obedience to its laws, by willingness to serve them when- 
ever and however such service may be required, and by 
abhorrence of everything detrimental to the public good. 
Since then, however, our economic conditions have 
changed. The resources of the country have been de- 
veloped upon a vast scale, the field of knowledge has
-P-A-G-E-84
  46 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
been extended, the processes of manufacture are com- 
plicated and scientific, and transportation has become a 
profession of the first importance. Work formerly 
done by hand is now performed by powerful and com- 
plex machinery, requiring high standards of intelligence 
for its design and operation. It has become necessary, 
therefore, for the state to provide its youth with the 
highest degree of education to meet these new condi- 
tions and to compete with the educational standards of 
other countries. It is nationally important for the 
schools to train for specific occupations, by teaching 
manual trades to those who would be artisans; the arts 
and principles of design to those who would be artists, 
chemists, electricians, etc., and stenography, bookkeep- 
ing, languages, banking, etc. to those who would engage 
in commerce. The commercial necessities of our coun- 
try at home and abroad require that our young people 
must be educated to conduct the highly organized and 
complicated business of the country as well or better 
than our competitors from England, France and Ger- 
many. The future prosperity of our country must de- 
pend largely upon the development of our foreign trade. 
Preparation therefor belongs to our schools. Are they 
ready for the great international test to which they must 
inevitably be subjected? 
For more than one hundred and fifty years our peo- 
ple have been engaged in clearing the forests, develop- 
ing the mines, building railroads, bridges and highways, 
constructing factories, mills and industrial establish- 
ments, and in cultivating the hills of the East and the 
prairies of the West. The “sons of Martha” have 
achieved great tasks, and the “sons of Mary” have been
-P-A-G-E-85
ADDRESSES 17 
diffident and overshadowed. We have had little time to | 
give recognition or encouragement to the latter. 
More than anything else the world needs those able 
to think, and by reason of independent thinking able to 
assume leadership. Business and financial leaders may 
be evolved from the discipline which is essential to suc- 
cess in business and finance. Political leadership may 
be evolved from the game of politics. The leadership 
of mind and spirit is nurtured in the discipline which is 
found in liberal studies, in knowledge of the facts of 
history, in communion with the great minds of the past, 
in the cultivation of the powers of concentration and 
reasoning which experience has shown is best derived 
from the study of the classics, by the toil of mathematics 
and the mastery of philosophy. The highest powers of 
expression are derived from the study of the English 
language and from careful analysis of the languages 
upon which our English tongue is based. While fully 
realizing the advantages of vocational study, neverthe- 
less it has been the English system of liberal studies 
which has produced poets like Shakespeare, Milton and 
Tennyson; writers like Addison, Swift and Johnson; 
scientists like Newton and Kelvin, and statesmen like 
Palmerston, Gladstone and Cromer. A system which 
has produced such men, and numberless others, cannot 
be totally condemned. More and more is the mental 
discipline which can be derived only from liberal studies 
coming to be required as the foundation for the special- 
ized courses necessary for admission to law and medi- 
cine, while these studies have been the gate of admission 
to the ministry and literature. 
There is one fact to which I would call attention be- 
fore closing. Education alone, either technical or lib-
-P-A-G-E-86
  "8 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
eral, will not elevate the moral standards of mankind. 
Moral elevation is an attribute of the soul, and is de- 
rived from religious teaching and moral discipline. It 
is a notable fact that the nation which boasted most of 
its intellectual development, its advancement in the arts 
and sciences, in its Kultur, when put to the test of war, 
has discarded every advance guaranteed by interna- 
tional law, including its own solemn covenants, and has 
debased itself below the standard of savagery. 
Every man of character impresses his qualities upon 
those about him. Learning, rectitude, nobility, and 
every other attribute of his character permeate those 
brought into contact with him. The man at the head 
of every organized group, whether it be the nation or 
a business organization, a college or a school, to a great 
degree impresses his character upon every individual 
comprised in it. The influence of the individual teacher 
upon the plastic minds of his pupils is incalculable. As 
character is the highest product of education, its recre- 
ation in others must ever be the primary test of educa- 
tion. 
What then are the real tests of education? They are 
discipline of the mind and spirit; the ability to create 
character of that exalted kind which unconsciously dis- 
seminates refinement and nobility; the development of 
powers of independent thought, which qualify for lead- 
ership and the evolution of that refinement of spirit 
which comes from communion with the highest things 
of earth and heaven. 
In saying this, I point out the fact that the time has 
gone by when anyone can hold up the principle that 
the duty of the state terminates when its people have 
acquired a mere common school education.

Henry W. Farnam 
President of the American Economic Association, 1912 
Professor of Political Economy, Yale University 
[Read by Professor F. A. Fetter] 
In the short space allotted to this paper, it is quite im- 
possible to discuss fundamental principles of education, 
and the most that can be done is to offer such testimony 
as the concrete experience of the individual may be 
able to furnish. In his argument against compulsory 
Latin President Eliot enumerates three human inter- 
ests which are of the highest importance, and no one of 
which requires a knowledge of Latin. These three in- 
terests are “concerned with religion, government, and 
the means of supporting and improving a family” 
(“The Case Against Compulsory Latin,” Atlantic 
Monthly, March, 1917, p. 857). It may at once be 
conceded that many millions of men have practiced re- 
ligion, have maintained government and have supported 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
their families without a knowledge of Latin. But while these three interests are fundamental, there are 
many others which are eminently desirable for an edu- 
cated man. One of these is the art of expression, and 
my argument for Latin will be confined to this one 
desideratum. 
The great distinction between the parent tongues of 
western Europe and their modern descendants is that 
they were more fully inflected, the different cases of 
nouns, adjectives and pronouns, as well as the different 
moods and tenses of verbs being indicated by changes 
in the prefixes or suffixes of the root word. Modern 
languages have, to a greater or less degree, lost these 
inflections. German has, perhaps, suffered less than 
most of them; English, more. The result, particularly 
in English, is a loss of conciseness and of exactitude. 
Shades of meaning are indicated by circumlocution. 
The root word itself indicates nothing with regard to 
its case, if a noun, or with regard to its mood and tense, 
if a verb. In fact, the same word may often be either 
a noun or a verb. 
In addition to this confusion arising from the loss of 
inflections, a new confusion has crept in through the 
adoption of an immense new vocabulary, the origin of 
which, though very recent, is often obscure. If no new 
word gained admission to the dictionary until passed 
upon by a committee of experts, we should probably 
enrich our popular language, as the scientists have en- 
riched the scientific language, by compounding words 
out of Greek or Latin fragments. But such cases are 
rare, and most of our new words are foundlings, drop- 
ped on the doorstep, with no pedigree and hardly an 
identification tag. The consequence is an almost gro-
-P-A-G-E-89
  ADDRESSES 81 
tesque ambiguity. Thus, a sleeper may mean a person 
who sleeps, or the vehicle in which he sleeps, or the 
stick of wood which supports the rail on which the 
sleeper which carries the sleeper rolls. A smoker may 
mean a man who smokes, or a car in which he smokes. 
A typewriter may be a soulless machine or a soulful 
young woman. The advertisement which appeared in 
an English paper, “Wanted—A capable girl to mind 
three children,” told, perhaps, more of the truth than 
the advertiser was conscious of. The headlines of our 
newspapers furnish daily reminders of the confusion 
which results when one and the same word may be 
either a noun or a verb and may be used either in the 
transitive or intransitive sense. 
In an age which cultivates efficiency, and in a science 
which studies economy, this ambiguity means wasted 
effort, and the best corrective is the study of languages 
which have not yet lost their grammar. Incidentally, 
it is of some value to be saved from wrong uses of Latin 
phrases and words which have become domiciled in the 
English language, and I regret that such barbarisms as 
“this data” have become so common among statisticians 
and economists that even those whose teeth were, a few 
years ago, set on edge by them, are now becoming cal- 
lous. It may be a mere accident, but I certainly have a 
distinct impression that of the many manuscripts on 
economic subjects which I have had occasion to read and 
edit of late years, those written by graduates of col- 
leges which have abandoned the classics are most sorely 
in need of revision. : 
In making a plea for the classics, and especially for 
Latin as a standard of exact expression, I refer only to 
the language when it is really taught and not when it
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
is muddled. It would seem superfluous to emphasize 
this fact, were it not that arguments have of late been 
set forth with great ability and no little authority which 
seem to be based upon this confusion. Dr. Flexner, 
for example, cites as an argument against Latin the 
fact that in the examinations held by the College En- 
trance Board in 1915, 76.6 per cent of the candidates 
failed to make even a mark of 60 in Cicero (“A Modern 
School,” Occasional Papers No. 8, Publications of the 
General Education Board, p. 6). If the statistics are 
correct, this argument may prove that Latin is not well 
taught in our schools, but does not prove that Latin, 
when well taught, is without value. It is an argument 
not against the usefulness of Latin when acquired, but 
against the uselessness of failing to acquire it. The 
remedy is to give better instruction in Latin, not to 
condemn it. 
Latin should be taught in the very first years in such 
a way that the pupil becomes thoroughly familiar with 
the current vocabulary and the inflections. 
My own experience dates back so many years that it 
no longer applies in full measure to modern conditions, 
and yet I believe that it may serve as a useful illustra- 
tion. I began my study of the classics in Germany, and 
I always had the feeling that the years which were de- 
voted to these subjects in an American college added 
little to the knowledge which I brought with me from 
across the ocean. I never felt that I gained any real 
familiarity with Greek, and I never appreciated Latin 
until, after taking my Bachelor of Arts degree in the 
United States, I had occasion to study Roman Law in 
Germany, and to use Latin as a vehicle of thought. I 
then appreciated, as never before, the wonderful di-
-P-A-G-E-91
  ADDRESSES 83 
rectness and clearness of the language. The conse- 
quence was that when I returned to our country and 
found that the entrance to an academic career lay 
through a tutorship and that a tutor was expected to 
teach, not a subject on which he might have specialized 
in his graduate work, but only Greek, Latin or mathe- 
matics, I elected Latin as the subject in which my in- 
competence was least pronounced. But, having had 
occasion to use and value the language in my study of 
the Roman Law, I was able to take it up with an enthus- 
iasm which I hope concealed from my students my dis- 
qualification for the task.

Tuomas Hastines

The study of the classics has a tendency, more espe- 
cially with the youth of a people, to instill into their 
thoughts a courage and keenness in the quest of truth, 
with a devotion to all that is beautiful. Eighteen years 
ago, in a Government report under the chairmanship 
of the distinguished Prime Minister of France, Mon- 
sieur Ribot, there was included this striking tribute to 
the advantages of a classic education: 
“L’etude de l’antiquité greque et latine a donné au 
genie francaise une mesure, une clarté et un élégance 
incomparable. C’est par elle que notre philosophie, nos 
lettres et nos arts ont brillé d’un si vif eclat; c’est par 
elle que notre influence morale s’est exercée en souver- 
aine dans le monde. L/esprit classique est la culte de la 
raison claire et libre, la recherche de la beauté harmoni-
-P-A-G-E-92
  84 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
euse et simple dans toutes les manifestations de la 
pensée.” 
Speaking as an architect, I have a far greater sym- 
pathy, both in art and literature, with the Renaissance 
which aimed to revive the Augustan Age of Rome, than 
with the more recent so-called Humanistic School which 
sought to build its foundation on the Golden Age of 
Athens. The greatest art of the last four hundred years 
has been founded upon Roman principles, and the re- 
cent examples of the so-called Neo Grec have today but 
few adherents. Architecturally we are still living in the 
period of the Renaissance, building upon classic tradi- 
tions, and if we can establish this fact we may find a 
certain striking analogy in its relation to the more con- 
servative tendency in liberal education. 
From prehistoric times until now each successive age 
has built in one, and only one, style of architecture. To- 
day we select from the past—building in every variety 
of style. Why should we not be modern, expressing the 
spirit of the time in a style of its own making? 
Style in its growth has always been governed by the 
universal law of development, one style being evolved 
from another. This evolution has always kept pace with 
the progress of the political, religious and economic 
spirit of each successive age. It has manifested itself 
unconsciously in the architect’s designs, under the im- 
peratives of new practical problems imposed upon him. 
As in nature the types and species of life have kept 
pace with the successive modifications of lands and seas 
and other physical conditions imposed upon them, so 
has architectural style in its growth kept pace with the 
successive modifications of civilization. The laws of the 
survival of the fittest have shaped the history of archi-  
-P-A-G-E-93
  
ADDRESSES 85 
tectural style just as truly as they have the different 
successive forms of life. Hence, the necessity that we 
keep and cultivate the spirit and traditions of our near 
forefathers, and that we respect our historic relations. . 
Were it necessary we could go back to the time of the 
mound builders and cave dwellers, and all through the 
history of architecture trace two parallel lines, one the 
history of civilization, and the other form and design 
constantly changing to meet modified conditions. One 
need only mention the Greek column so beautifully 
modified by the Romans to meet the new and more 
varied methods of construction. We could multiply 
illustrations without limit. The battlements and ma- 
chicolated cornices of the Romanesque; the thick walls 
and the small windows placed high above the floor, tell 
us of an age when every man’s house was indeed his 
castle, his fortress, and his stronghold. 
It is interesting to notice how, in other times, an 
architect was even able to complete a tower or add an 
arcade or extend a building following the general lines 
of the original composition without following its style, 
so that almost every historic building within its own 
walls tells the story of its long life. How much more 
interesting alike to the historian and the artist are these 
results. Until now an artist has always respected the 
traditions of the generation which preceded him, and, 
as it were, he was apprenticed by its influence. Who- 
ever builds in a style not in keeping with the spirit of 
his time is responsible for retarding the normal progress 
of the art. We must have a language if we would talk. 
If there be no common language there can be no com- 
munication of ideas either architectural or literary. We 
must hope to find the classic again everywhere assert- 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    86 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
ing itself, in order to renew that consistency of style 
which has existed in all times until the present gener- 
ation; then only, as of old, shall we find modernity in 
every performance of man’s ingenuity; in the work of 
the artist or the artisan, from the smallest and most in- 
significant jewel or book cover to the noblest monu- 
ment of human invention or creation; from the most 
ordinary kitchen utensil to the richest and most costly 
furniture or decoration that adorns our dwelling. 
The architects in the early history of America were 
distinctly modern and closely related in their work to 
their contemporaries in Europe. Building upon classic 
forms they seem not only to have inherited traditions, 
but to have religiously adhered to them. I believe that 
it is because of this that the genuine and naive character 
of their work, which was of its own period, still lives 
and has a real charm, though ofttimes wanting in tech- 
nical skill. ft 
We have seen that the life of an epoch must make its 
impress upon its art and its literature. It is equally 
true that the art of a people helps to form and model 
its character. In this way it reacts upon it. If there is 
beauty in the pla s of our cities, and in the buildings 
which form our public squares and highways, its good 
influence will make itself felt upon every passer-by. 
Beauty in our buildings is an open book of involuntary 
education and refinement, and it uplifts and ennobles 
human character; it is a song and a sermon without 
words. It inculcates in a people a true sense of dignity, 
a sense of reverence and respect for tradition, and it 
makes an atmosphere in its environment which breeds 
the proper kind of contentment, that kind of content-
-P-A-G-E-95
  ADDRESSES 87 
or moral precept, nor indeed any spoken word of man, 
would obtain which had not been expressed with a true 
sense of beauty. 
To eliminate the classics from your university curric- 
ulum would be as great a calamity as to teach architec- 
ture suppressing the study of the entablature and the 
column. To know Greek and Latin is, I believe, as 
much an essential part of a literary education as a true 
understanding of the classic orders is the beginning of 
all architectural schooling. These are the foundations 
upon which the artists in literature and architecture 
alike build their superstructure. These fundamental 
first principles in education cultivate and stimulate the 
true sense of beauty and refinement while they impress 
upon the mind of the student an accurate appreciation 
of those most subtle laws of proportion which though 
intuitively learned are none the less true and to be re- 
lied upon as a part of our education. 
It is, I believe, a law of the universe that the forms 
of life which are fittest to survive are beautiful in form 
and color. Natural selection is beautifully expressed, 
ugliness and deformity are synonymous, and so in the 
economy of life what would survive must be of its own 
period and beautifully expressed. 
A great tide of historic information has constantly 
flowed through the channel of monuments erected by 
successive civilizations, each age expressing its own life, 
and we can almost live in the past through its monu- 
ments. The recently discovered buried cities of Assyria 
and Lydia give us a vivid idea of a civilization lost to 
history. The pyramids of Cheops and the Temples of 
Karnak and Luxor tell us more of that ingenuity which 
we cannot fathom, and the grandeur of the life and
-P-A-G-E-96
  88 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
history of the Egyptian people than the scattered and 
withered documents or fragments of inscriptions that 
have chanced to survive the crumbling influences of 
time. The Parthenon and the Erectheum bespeak the 
intellectual refinement of the Greeks as much as their 
epic poems or their philosophy. The triumphal arches, 
the aqueducts, the Pantheon, and the basilicas of Rome 
tell us more of the great constructive genius of the early 
republic and the empire of the Caesars than the frag- 
méntary and contradictory annals of wars and politi- 
cal intrigues. 
The unsurpassed and inspiring beauty of the Gothic 
cathedrals which bewilder us, and the cloisters which 
enchant us, impress on our minds a living picture of the 
aspirations of mediaeval times—a civilization that must 
have mingled with its mysticism an intellectual and 
spiritual grandeur which the so-called Dark Ages of the 
historian have failed adequately to record; and in Amer- 
ica, even amid the all absorbing work of constructing a 
new government, our people found time to speak to us 
today in the silent language of their simple colonial 
architecture of the temperament and character of our 
forefathers. 
Will our monuments of to-day adequately record the 
splendid achievements of our contemporaneous life— 
the spirit of modern justice and liberty—the progress 
of modern science, the genius of modern invention and 
discovery, the elevated character of our institutions? 
Will disorder and confusion in our modern architecture 
express the intelligence of this twentieth century? 
Would that we might learn a lesson from the past, in 
art and letters alike, from the stately Latin and grace- 
ful Greek languages, with their lesson of order, propor-  
-P-A-G-E-97
  ADDRESSES 89 
tion and harmony, and from the glorious antique lit- 
erature, so that modern architecture, wherever under- 
taken, might more worthily tell the story of the dignity 
of this great epoch and be more expressive of this con- 
temporaneous life.

and elaborate rotundity of phrase; but merely to de-

observer for forty-odd years of the indications afforded 
by style, that if the railroad man had asked an opinion 
I should have advised him to give the young man a 
trial. More than that, I should have urged him to thank 
both the god of Transportation and the god of Vocative 
and Avocative Literature that his choice of a secretary 
was not confined to persons introducing themselves in 
fashion like this: 
“Take it from me, I’m the guy that’s wise to what 
you want. This is straight goods. There ain’t a leak in 
the lid of my nut. The lingo’s all there. I’m fifty-fifty 
William W. Shakespeare and Old Dictionary Johnson. 
Try it on with your fly word twirlers and if any hot one 
gets by the plate then Me for the bench.” 
At a guess I should say that more than half of the 
really distinguished writers I have watched during the 
period of observation could have passed Horace Gree- 
ley’s profane test of fitness for newspaper work; that 
is, they were without Latin and Greek at first hand. 
But further I should say that in the great majority of 
these cases the classical influence upon habits and meth- 
ods of expression, acting secondarily through the slower 
process of self development, through natural selection, 
through conscious or unconscious imitation of admired 
models, was not less potent and perhaps superficially a 
trifle more apparent than when it had been exerted di- 
rectly through the schools. In this as in every other 
such field it is a mistake to reckon the plus or the minus 
as affecting only individuals certified with diplomas. 
The preservation of the standards, not the census of the 
classically educated, is what signifies. 
To the multitude of good reasons accumulating here 
today I suggest the addition of this:
-P-A-G-E-99
  ADDRESSES 91 
The most serious practical evil to result from the 
elimination of the classics will fall upon the English 
language itself. There is no livelier perception than in 
the newspaper offices of the disintegration produced by 
the absurd circumstance that only so many millimeters 
of big type can be made to go into so many millimeters 
width of column. Is it not ridiculous that under the 
pressure of the popular demand for spectacular typog- 
raphy the choice of words for headlines—and today 
these are not only the most conspicuous thing in any 
newspaper but more influential than a hundred chairs of 
rhetoric in shaping the future conventions of English 
speech—is coming to be determined by size and not by 
signification ? 
Put not too much blame on the headliner. To under- 
stand his craftsmanship, try to construct a few head- 
lines in millimeter English. Try to build a phrase 
limited by linear measurement out of words quarried, 
for instance, from the Latinist letter which was read 
just now. Try it then from the blend of short Anglo- 
Saxon and street slang which I took the liberty to 
imagine. You will see why the fraudulent misuse of 
many a lean, convenient verb, noun or adjective is be- 
ing impressed daily upon the gray matter of the com- 
ing generation. You will see why the straitjacket 
of physical space is distorting not only philology but 
syntax, and forging a syncopated system of word rela- 
tions as crude and false as that of the Chinook jargon. 
And I think you will understand why a newspaper man, 
bred to the honest old standards, like my friend Dr. 
Miller of the Times, is impelled to come to Princeton 
to do his bit in upholding the movement which keeps

open the sole reasonable hope of checking this degringo- 
lade of accuracy and dignity in English expression. 
In its worst aspects headline English is the yellow 
peril of the language. If unchecked, the havoc of an- 
archy is irreparable that it can wreak upon that marvel- 
lous composite, that adequate instrument of any sort of 
thought, that heritage from two hundred generations 
of our thinking ancestors, that palimpsest not only of 
Latin and Greek culture but also of the earlier cultures 
handed down to us through the Greco-Roman medium 
from away back as far as Nippur. 
Not merely, then, because of the disciplinary loss, nor 
yet mainly on account of the informative loss involved 
in the discard of the classics, but principally because 
the instant there disappears from the education of the 
educated the means of knowing, for example, that 
a telephone is a telephone for the reason that through 
it we speak afar, and not for the reason that some ad- 
vertiser deemed this a taking name for the particular 
utensil, to that extent the racial memory begins to de- 
cay, the racial imagination begotten of memory is weak- 
ened, the sense of precise meanings begins to lose its 
edge, and the English language ceases to be a vital thing 
and becomes a mere code of arbitrary signals wigwagged 
from mouth to ear. 
Were I the emergency autocrat of this language I 
should proclaim in drastic regulations and enforce by 
severe penalties the American duty of adherence to the 
old habits of speech, the old scrupulous respect for the 
finer shades of meaning, the old rigid observance of the 
morality of word relations; and this, I believe, can be| 
done only by maintaining the classical culture at hig! 
potency. For the “guy” or “gink” who is “wise to wha

vernacular is punching the intelligence out of it; and he 
promises, unless deterred, to leave the precious fabric 
as full of holes as a colander and as void of working 
efficiency as a last month’s commutation ticket.

Cuares R. Miter 
Editor of The New York Times, New York City 
A man of my calling, comfortably assiduous and 
having length of years, puts into print the equivalent of 
100 octavo volumes of 350 pages each. Who in the 
realm of pure literature writes so much? If in Dante’s 
thought Virgil, with the Eclogues, the Georgics and the 
Aeneid, was the fount of a broad river of speech, then 
a veritable Amazon of utterance flows forth from the 
pen that, year after year, contributes a daily column to 
the press. It is not literature; it would miss the mark 
if it were, but its object is best attained if it have the 
form and quality of literature. To the multitude it is 
the abiding and most familiar example in the use of 
language in other than spoken form. It is quite unnec- 
essary to argue that a stream from which so many take 
their fill should be pure at the source. Standards may 
be kept inviolate by the pen of genius writing for the 
cloistered few; current speech takes its form very much 
from the daily newspaper. 
It is a responsibility not lightly borne by men of con- 
scientious habit. Through what discipline comes fitness 
to bear it worthily? We must not with too clamorous 
insistence press the case for Latin and Greek beyond 
safe limits. loo many men write good English who
-P-A-G-E-102
  94 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
never read a line of either tongue. Much reading of 
English gives command of an encompassing vocabulary, 
good taste and the instinctive sense of language may 
confer the power to employ it with elegance and pro- 
priety. However acquired there must be an instructed 
discrimination in the use of the elements of the lan- 
guage, a sense always clear and sure of the just word. 
That discriminating sense comes, if it be unfailing can 
come only, through knowledge of the origin, history 
and composition of words. It is my observation and 
judgment that the surest way, certainly the shortest 
way to the acquisition of this sense of values leads 
through the texts of the Greek and Latin authors and 
the less alluring but indispensable pages of the gram- 
marians. That conviction rests upon a good many 
years of observation. I should give it much emphasis 
if I were called upon to advise in this matter young men 
looking forward to a newspaper career. 
This is very familiar ground and I forbear. I mean 
merely that a newspaper reporter, correspondent or 
editorial writer who does not know, citing only exam- 
ples that have recently come under my eye, that expur- 
gate does not mean expunge, that egregious is only by 
custom and not by etymology an epithet of reproach, 
and that a decimated regiment may still be a force to 
be reckoned with, has much to learn about the English 
language. Lord Bryce, in accounting for the newborn 
interest in this question displayed by “certain sections 
of the population which were not wont to interest them- 
selves in educational matters,” says that “there has been 
created in the popular mind an association, now deeply 
rooted, between the knowledge of applied science and 
material prosperity.” This is economic determinism

applied to education. To the dogs with the higher 
things of the spirit; youth shall train in branches that 
will provide the biggest store of bread and butter for 
the body. For any young man who would become a 
newspaper writer that is a false, deluding doctrine. It 
is precisely the good old fashioned classical schooling 
that gives him command of the higher places, the higher 
rewards. If he would climb to the high places, let him 
build the stairway during his college years. 
I am void of all fear about contradiction when I say 
that a newspaper man, and particularly an editorial 
writer, who has missed making the acquaintance of the 
gods and mortal speaking men from whom our heritage 
of civilization has descended must fail to do full justice 
to his talents, however great they may be. In modern 
times every unexplored river, every mountain un- 
climbed, has been a challenge to the daring spirit of 
man, until the secret of all sources has been laid bare, 
all summits topped, save the very few that nature re- 
serves for the glory of heroic spirits in later generations. 
If we strive so unconscionably in these sterile adven- 
tures, shall we be incurious about that Roman fountain- 
head of our laws, our political institutions and a great 
part of our language, shall we disdain to climb where 
through the ages our fathers have climbed, to that Ath- 
enian summit whence the light of civilization burst upon 
the world, where the noblest in art, in poetry, in letters 
had its birth? For us there is no other source, no other 
mountain top. Beyond Greece and Rome, save in re- 
ligion, we trace no line of descent. The Oriental mon- 
archies blazed up and were extinguished. They left us 
no heritage. Our mother lands are Greece and Rome. 
There men won deathless fame in works that time has

undo the Renaissance, and of the coeval printer’s art, 
seemingly born to transmit for our advantage and en- 
joyment the treasures of Greece and Rome, make a 
sumpter mule. burdened only with commodities ap- 
praisable in cash? 
I think I do not wander from the point, the practical 
point. Without understanding of the ancient world, 
our ancient world, there can be no sound understand- 
ing of the modern world and its affairs. It is highly 
desirable that a newspaper man should try to under- 
stand the world about him. I know that his effort will 
be less toilsome, its reward richer and more certain, if 
the light kindled by classical knowledge burns within 
his mind. To this mastery and understanding a profi- 
ciency in science, skill in the mysteries of the external 
world, no matter in what high degree held, serve no pur- 
pose of guidance. What man is doing, singly or asso- 
ciatively, that is the newspaper’s province. And for 
one who has to take thought about the behavior of man, 
and give expression to it, no branch of knowledge is 
alien, none superfluous. Culture, even if for the pure 
joy of culture, is of high and constant service. It fresh- 
ens, stimulates, uplifts, vivifies.

All the world is brighter, if the Athenian sun return.”

Henry Casor Loner 
United States Senator from Massachusetts 
For more than five hundred years scholars and men 
of education have been discussing the poetry, the drama, 
the philosophy, the literature of Greece and Rome 
which we are wont to include in the word “classics.” 
When anyone therefore attempts to give utterance to 
his thoughts upon that vast subject the line of Terence, 
“Nullum est jam dictum, quod non dictum sit prius,” 
stares him in the face with all the relentless warning of 
Dante’s inscription over the gates of Hell. We can 
only console ourselves with the witty comment of Aelius 
Donatus, which comes to us oddly enough through 
Saint Jerome, 
“Pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt,” 
and go forward with our repetitions and reiterations of 
what wiser and better men have said before. There is 
only one difference to be noted between us and our 
predecessors and that is in the present mode of treat- 
ment. Until within fifty years, broadly speaking, the 
acceptance of the classics as the foundation and essen- 
tial condition of the higher education was unquestioned 
and the note of all discussion was that of praise and 
admiration. Now the position of those who uphold 
classical education is defensive; the friends of the classics 
are contending for the very existence of the learning 
which they love. There has come a vast change in the 
attitude toward the “humanities” of those who guide 
education. Is this change and the consequent assault
-P-A-G-E-106
98 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
upon the classics justified? Is it not being carried to a 
most injurious extreme? 
We cannot answer these questions without a glance 
at the past, without recalling for a moment the com- 
monplaces of modern history, because modern history 
begins with the revival of learning and the revival of 
learning was the resurrection of the literature and the 
civilization of Greece and Rome. From the days of the 
Italian humanists when the discovery of a Greek or 
Latin manuscript, a palimpsest perhaps hidden in some 
remote convent, was equal almost to a patent of no- 
bility, for some five hundred years the classics were not 
only regarded as the symbol and test of the highest 
education but as the highest education itself. Some 
few classical authors were familiar to Europe long be- 
fore the age of Petrarch, but the great discoveries of 
classical literature were coincident with what is known 
as the Renaissance. It matters not whether the resur- 
rection of this great and long buried literature was the 
cause of the Renaissance, or was a powerful influence 
or was merely a manifestation, a product of the time. 
In the minds of men the revival of learning—that is, of 
the classics—was indissolubly associated with the re- 
birth of intellectual freedom, with the breaking of the 
fetters of the age of faith, with the liberation of the 
human mind, with the dispersion of the dark clouds 
which had obscured the vision of men and which had 
made this world for the mass of the people a foul and 
_ cruel place, reeking with filth and disease and steeped 
in ignorance, on the theory that only in this manner 
could eternal tortures be avoided and eternal joys in 
the next world be secured. When Fox founded Corpus 
Christi College at Oxford early in the sixteenth cen-
-P-A-G-E-107
  ADDRESSES 99 
tury he established two chairs for Greek and Latin “to 
extirpate barbarism.” Even so men in those days 
looked upon the two great languages as bringing them 
from darkness to light, from barbarism to civilization. 
It is not to be wondered at therefore that men felt a 
profound gratitude to the studies to which they attribu- 
ted the new birth of intellectual freedom or that they 
made those studies the touchstone of the highest edu- 
cation, the badge of scholarship without which, even if 
the acquaintance was only nominal, no one could assert 
that he was educated either liberally or as a gentleman. 
This natural gratitude with its profound and lasting 
effect upon the minds of men was very far from being 
purely sentimental. In the literature of Greece and 
Rome, thus disclosed anew to the world, was preserved 
the noblest poetry, lyric, epic and dramatic, which the 
imagination of man had brought forth—unrivalled then, 
never surpassed since. In the surviving ruins of tem- 
ples and palaces, in the statues taken from the earth, 
there met the eyes of the eager searchers an art and an 
architecture of extraordinary perfection both in pro- 
portion and in form which then regained possession of 
the world and which has never ceased to influence pro- 
foundly all that the architect and the artist have since 
produced for the instruction, the delight or the use of 
their fellow men from that day to this. As the manu- 
scripts gradually came forth into the light there was 
disclosed the history of antiquity from Herodotus to 
Tacitus and models were thus given to the world of 
what history and biography might be. Philosophy and 
metaphysics, culminating in Plato and Aristotle and in 
the discourses of Socrates, put at the service of man- 
kind the speculations of the most remarkable minds the

world has ever known, ranging over every field of hu- 
man thought and affecting and advancing knowledge 
and civilization with a force which must always be reck- 
oned with and which lies at the very roots of all that has 
been since accomplished. There too, in this literature 
of the past, were uncovered the foundations of the very 
sciences which would now consign the classics to ob- 
livion. In Euclid were found the system and problems 
of geometry; the science of numbers and arithmetic had 
engaged the acute Greek intelligence; Lucretius em- 
bodied the atomic theory of the Epicureans in one of 
the world’s great poems, and the essays, orations and 
letters of Cicero gave style to the prose of modern EKu- 
rope. In the appliances which improve the conditions 
of daily existence the men of the Renaissance found 
ample lessons in the work of the Roman engineers which 
had covered Europe with roads and bridges; in systems 
of drainage as old as Babylon, a marvellous contrast to 
the filth of the mediaeval cities which used their streets 
as open sewers and bred disease and plagues and the 
black death among the people. They contemplated at 
last with considerate eyes the ruins of the baths and 
gymnasiums and slowly learned that personal cleanli- 
ness promoted health and comfort and that dirt was not 
really essential to sanctity. 
So it came to pass that Greek and Latin, with mathe- 
matics as a companion, took possession of education and 
held it well down into the second half of the nineteenth 
century. During this uncontested reign came not only 
such events as the discovery of America and the Refor- 
mation but a vast development of art and literature, the 
great modern literature of the world, sculpture inspired 
by Greece but touched with the imagination of Christi-
-P-A-G-E-109
ADDRESSES 101 
anity, and such frescoes and paintings as the world had 
never seen before. Nor did the devotion to classical 
scholarship narrow the field of intellectual activity. In- 
vention was at work and the bounds of knowledge were 
widened beyond all that men had ever imagined to be 
possible. Science, which in certain lower forms has of 
late grown so hostile to the classics, could hardly be said 
to have been impeded or retarded by their supremacy 
during a period which began with Copernicus and Gali- 
leo, which included Bacon and Newton and closed with 
Charles Darwin and Pasteur, to take at random only a 
few of the greatest among many great names. The 
classical system supplemented by mathematics was 
known as a liberal education in contradistinction to an 
education devoid of classical studies or confined to 
special and technical training. The phrase was just, 
because whatever the defects of the classical education 
it may truly be said that it has always instilled into all 
those subjected to it a respect for knowledge and learn- 
ing in any form and in any direction, possessing a really 
liberalizing influence which seems at times sadly lacking 
in purely scientific or technical training. 
Despite the fact, however, that the classical educa- 
tion was essentially liberal in its attitude toward all 
education and all learning, the opposition to it which 
began, roughly speaking, some fifty years ago was di- 
rected against its exclusiveness, and sought to overthrow 
its monopoly of studies which rested on the doctrine that 
whatever else a student might acquire he could never be 
deemed a thoroughly educated man unless he had at 
least passed through a certain course of classics. The 
movement against this exclusiveness was based no doubt 
upon sound reasons. It was entirely successful and the

        102 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
doors of our universities were opened to those who of- 
fered scientific courses or modern languages in place of 
one at least of the classical requirements. But the move- 
ment has not stopped at this point. It is now pressing 
on toward the practical exclusion of the classics, toward 
a complete reversal of the old system, and there are 
many preparatory schools supposed to fit boys for the 
higher education where Greek at least is substantially 
abandoned. In the universities themselves the tendency 
is more and more in the direction of giving up the clas- 
sics and making the entire essential curriculum consist 
of scientific and economic studies united in some mea- 
sure with modern languages. 
This comparatively recent and very steht hostil- 
ity to the classics, to the studies which lifted modern 
civilization out of the darkness that followed the fall of 
the Roman Empire and which for nearly five hundred 
years was the foundation and the test of the higher edu- 
cation, seems to deserve examination. Before the clas- 
sics are relegated to a few scholars, philologists and 
lovers of literature, let us inquire whether it is wise thus 
to sentence them to banishment. In making this in- 
quiry it is well to begin with the fundamental question 
as to what education is in the last analysis. 
The first and dominant object of all education is to 
teach the child, the boy or girl, to use his or her mind; 
that is, in other words, to teach them so to control their 
minds that they can apply them to any subject of study 
and especially to a subject which it is a duty and not a 
pleasure to master and understand. When this power 
to use and control the mind is once thoroughly attained 
the boy or girl can then learn anything which his or her 
mind is capable of receiving and acquiring. Very few
-P-A-G-E-111
ADDRESSES 103 
minds can master every branch of learning. The man 
who can learn languages may be wholly unable to go 
beyond the rudiments of mathematics. Some minds 
again are much more powerful than others, just as some 
bodies are more muscular than others, and are able to 
go further in any direction than the average intelli- 
gence. We all have our mental limitations. But it is 
none the less profoundly true that those who have been 
taught to use and control their minds can apply them to 
any subject and go as far as their individual limitations 
permit. So far all, I believe, who have reflected upon 
the subject will agree. I think we may also agree that 
as any form of exercise will develop some muscles and 
some forms will develop all, so any kind of study prop- 
erly pursued, whether it is arithmetic or Sanscrit roots, 
will develop the muscles of the mind and give it the 
power of continuous application by a mere exercise of 
the will. It is equally true, however, that the use of 
dumb bells, on the one hand, and walking, on the other, 
will not develop the same set of muscles, although both 
contribute generally to health and strength. In attain- 
ing to the command of the mind, to the power of con- 
trolling its application by will, the same rule holds good, 
but there is a wide choice of method, because while any 
study can be used to develop strength and vigor, some 
will narrow and others broaden; some will cease to have 
any value beyond the simple production of strength, 
while others equally efficient in this direction will lead to 
results which bring lifelong uses and pleasures. 
It is at this point that the division of opinion begins. 
The old and long established curriculum which was con- 
fined to the classics and to mathematics was quite as 
efficient as any other system in teaching a boy, if the
-P-A-G-E-112
Fi 
104 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
teaching was good, to apply and control his mind. This | 
also might be said in its behalf, that when a boy was 
capable of learning and also of retaining anything 
which he had been taught, the two capabilities being by 
no means inseparable, he went from school to college or 
into the world really knowing something about one or 
two subjects, instead of knowing little or nothing of a 
great many subjects upon which his time had been dis- 
persed, a result which seems to be preferred at the pres- 
ent day by educational experts no doubt far wiser than 
those of the past. If I may be permitted, let me take 
an illustration from my own experience. There was a 
certain boy, whom I knew very intimately, brought up 
as we all were fifty years since under the old curriculum. 
When he went to college he knew thoroughly the Greek 
and Latin grammars in which he had been painfully 
and reluctantly drilled. He knew both the syntax and 
prosody and was fully possessed of the idea that a false 
quantity in Latin was little short of a crime; his feelings 
on this point were like those of Browning’s Spanish 
monk as to the 
“great text in Galatians, 
Once you trip on it, entails 
Twenty-nine distinct damnations, 
One sure, if another fails.” 
He could write Latin prose. It was far from classical, 
but it was grammatical and comprehensible. He could 
read Latin and Greek at sight; that is, Greek no more 
difficult that the Crito and Gorgias which he studied in 
his sophomore year. He was able to learn enough arith- 
metic, algebra, plane and solid geometry and trigonom- 
etry to pass all his examinations with rather high per-
-P-A-G-E-113
  ADDRESSES 105 
centages, but he was wholly unable to retain them and 
they fled after the examinations and left “not a rack 
behind.” In all that concerned mathematics his limita- 
tions were hopeless. In the middle of his college course, 
tempted by the attractions and greater ease of the elec- 
tive system, he deserted his Latin and Greek, which he 
has regretted all his life since, for although he has re- 
tained his Latin so that he can read it with pleasure, his 
Greek, neglected, has become laborious and would re- 
quire to regain it in proper measure time which a much 
occupied life could not spare. Since those far off days 
the boy has had sons and grandsons who in turn have 
been blessed by all the most modern advantages and 
latest improvements in education. He has observed 
them closely and he has failed to see that they were bet- 
ter taught than he was or knew more or could use their 
minds better than he could at the same age. Of course 
after school ended his sons came to know far more than 
their father because they had finer intelligences. But 
the boy of whom I speak has remained so unregenerate 
that he is trying even now to make sure that his grand- 
sons are taught Greek at school, so that in the days he 
will not see they may at least know what resulted from 
the wrath of Achilles and why people speak of bending 
the bow of Odysseus. I can hear the wise educator of 
today, as I indulge in this reminiscence, exclaim at such 
an education as I have described and rejoice that it has 
been done away with. Perhaps he is right. I should 
not think of setting my opinion against his. Yet I can- 
not but feel some doubt of his absolute correctness 
creep over me when I consider the events of the last 
three years, as to the perfection of our most modern 
civilization which is so largely the work of our most
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
advanced methods of education. I have become very 
sceptical as to the wisdom which would cast the litera- 
ture of Greece and Rome upon the dust heaps, when 
I have contemplated the performances of the most di- 
versely and most thoroughly educated people in the 
world, from whom we have so largely borrowed in the 
way of education; when I have seen that people develop 
to the highest point the science of destroying human 
lives, as perhaps was to have been expected; when I 
have seen them produce an organized barbarism far 
surpassing in its savage efficiency any that has ever 
afflicted the world; when I have witnessed the deeds 
wrought by the products of the most modern and im- 
proved methods of education which surpass in wanton 
destruction, in equally wanton cruelty, in sheer naked 
horror, anything which history can show; when I have 
beheld all this I have seriously doubted whether the 
most modern education has been quite such a complete 
success as its advocates assert. In the centuries of 
classical education which followed the Renaissance and 
the revival of learning there were wars in abundance— 
generally needless, sometimes desolating, often cruel, 
always destructive and sad. But in all that long period 
there was never anything so wholly hideous as that 
which we have seen in this present war. “Ruin has 
taught me thus to ruminate” and I think that it is easy 
to show that to detect a connection beween methods of 
education and the events of the present worldwide war 
is not wholly fanciful. Meantime let me ask pardon 
for the long digression to which my little illustration 
has given rise and let us return to the main question. 
Admitting that any form of learning can if properly 
administered teach the use and the control of the mind;
-P-A-G-E-115
  ADDRESSES 107 
admitting that there is a wide choice in the forms to be 
adopted for this purpose and that it is well that the 
classical exclusiveness or monopoly has been ended, let 
us consider if it is not also well to resist the attempt 
now on foot to drive the classics from the preparatory 
schools and treat them with a cold and almost deadly 
indifference in the universities. 
The reasons given for this treatment of the classics 
are various in form but eventually the same in sub- 
stance. They may all practically be reduced to the ob- 
jection made to me very lately, when I was urging that 
the classics ought to be taught in every school which 
prepares for the higher education, to the effect that they 
were of no use in after life. I have often quoted in this 
connection Lowell’s definition of a university, as a place 
where nothing useful was taught, and beneath the wit 
lies a sound philosophy demonstrating that there must 
be places where learning, scholarship and knowledge 
can be pursued and acquired for their own sake, because 
if their fate is to be decided simply by the money test 
they will soon wither away, and thought and civilization 
and the higher life of the intellect will die with them. 
I have used the words “money test,” and when people 
say the classics are of no use they mean very frequently, 
if not very generally, that they will not help a man to 
make money. If this was applied to the pursuits which 
have no purpose except to enable a man to earn his own 
living, a high and primary duty, it would be certainly 
sound; but the higher education, which multitudes de- 
sire and many in varying degrees attain, goes beyond 
the manual occupations and aims at least to develop the 
purely intellectual faculties. Here the mere money test 
seems unsatisfactory; in fact many persons regard it as
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
a very sordid test indeed. The apostles and teachers of 
religion, the moralists, the poets, the dramatists, the 
artists, the philosophers, the students of science and of 
nature, the men whose thought has moved the world and 
led humanity in its groping, stumbling march across the 
centuries, have rarely been money seekers or money get- 
ters. Without such men and such minds it is highly 
probable that we should still be running naked in the 
woods and the opportunities even for making money 
would be very small. Tried by the money test alone 
everything but reading, writing and arithmetic would 
properly be excluded and therefore I think we may dis- 
card money making as a wholly worthless test for the 
exclusion of the classics or of any other study which 
should engage the attention of those who seek in any 
degree the higher education. 
The larger objection that the classics are neither nec- 
essary nor useful in after life to those who have studied 
them in school or college is so vague that it can only be 
dealt with in general terms. As to the question of the 
necessity I can only reply in the words of the greatest 
of geniuses who made a little learning go a very long 
way and gathered a small fortune at the same time. 
When Regan says “What need one?” Lear replies: 
“O! Reason not the need; our basest beggars 
Are in the poorest thing superfluous: 
Allow not nature more than nature needs, 
Man’s life is cheap as beast’s.” 
When we come to the question of utility the field is a 
wide one and the tests must be comparative and cannot 
be absolute, but a little inquiry and consideration are 
not out of place before we accept the dogma of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
    ADDRESSES 109 
votaries of applied science and of the mechanic arts as 
well as of so-called practical men. ‘Take the learned 
professions. Surely it is well that the clergy should 
have some knowledge of the language of the New 
Testament and of that other in which a large part of 
the Christian world repeat their prayers and read their 
Bibles. It cannot be wholly without value to physicians 
and surgeons to be acquainted with the language and 
the literature of the race among whom their noble and 
beneficent profession finds its birthplace or of the lan- 
guage in which they still write their prescriptions, or of 
both these languages from which they bring forth for 
their new drugs and new diseases names which not in- 
frequently they mispronounce. Lawyers no doubt can 
make a living, and often a very good one, knowing only 
the statutes and the more obvious rules of pleading and 
practice. But it can hardly be questioned that if they 
go beyond this limited region a familiarity with the lan- 
guage which enshrines the maxims they quote, and in 
which is written that great system of jurisprudence be- 
queathed to us by the Romans and still followed in most 
countries of Western civilization, is not only useful but 
desirable. If we turn to the higher sciences we find a 
like condition. The astronomer cannot explore the 
heavens without seeing the beautiful mythology of 
Greece forever written in the stars. The Greek alpha- 
bet figures in his catalogues and calculations and some 
of his greatest forerunners wrote in Latin. The natur- 
alists, the botanists, the geologists, the biologists, not 
only owe their very names to the classics which some of 
them despise, but it would not come amiss if they knew, 
as no doubt many of them do, something of the lan- 
guages from which they take their nomenclatures and 
   
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
of the literatures where appear the first guesses at scien- 
tific truths and the first and often very brilliant specu- 
lations as to the secrets of the universe. In philology, 
anthropology and archaeology a knowledge of Latin 
and Greek is of course essential. As to literature it is 
needless to argue. A literary man should know some- 
thing of literature, and literature includes the writings 
of Greece and Rome. In all these instances which I 
have cited it is difficult to find justification for asserting 
that the study of the classics is a waste of time because 
they are useless in after life. 
It will, I know, be objected that I have mentioned 
only learned professions, the higher sciences and liter- 
ature and have omitted that supremely important per- 
son whom certain people desire most especially to pro- 
tect against the ravages of the time wasting classics— 
“the average man.” I am as far as possible from for- 
getting him. Lincoln told John Hay one morning how 
he had dreamed the night before that he entered a 
crowded hall to make a speech. As he passed down the 
aisle he heard someone say “What a common looking 
man,” and in his dream he turned to the man who had 
spoken and said, “My friend, God loves common look- 
ing men. That’s why He makes so many of them.” The 
“average man” is the central figure in our problem. Re- 
peatedly have I been told that there was no use in teach- 
ing the classics to boys in school or college because the 
“average men” never used them or recurred to them in 
after life. One feels inclined to say “All the worse for 
the ‘average man’ ” and to feel sorry for his loss of so 
much that is elevating and delightful. But admitting 
the truth of the objection, how much real force is there 
in it when one applies the comparative test? How large
-P-A-G-E-119
  
ADDRESSES 111 
a part do mathematics and science in various forms play 
in the daily life and current interests of the “average 
man”? How many “average men” amuse their leisure 
by solving algebraic problems, or by trying to conceive 
the fourth dimension; how many can explain to you— 
I take an obvious illustration—the Mendelian theory 
of the dominant and recessive qualities, or the Linnaean 
system, or tell you of the movements and appearances 
of the fauna of Europe during the glacial periods and 
intervals, or even name to you all the great constella- 
tions of stars which look down upon them nightly in 
silent splendor? My occupations have brought me into 
contact with very many average men and also with men 
above and below the average, and far more have refer- 
red to the history and literature of Greece and Rome 
than to any of the well known scientific subjects to 
which I have at random alluded. The fact is that not 
to know who Mendel was or what the fossils show as to 
animal life is not necessarily esteemed a mark of igno- 
rance, but never to have heard of Socrates, or Pericles, 
of Hannibal or Caesar or Cicero, is held to indicate a 
very defective education to say the least. And yet no 
one would think of arguing that boys should not be 
made acquainted with the simpler forms of mathematics 
and geometry because in after years the “average man” 
as a rule finds little use and less pleasure from them in 
daily life. 
While it is true that the strongest and most intoler- 
ant hostility to the classics comes in the name of science, 
sometimes assumed without warrant by the persons who 
employ it, there is another movement against the lan- 
guages and literature of Greece and Rome conducted 
by those who urge that they be displaced and replaced  
-P-A-G-E-120
  112 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
by modern languages which are either their children or 
their debtors. No one, I think, can feel more keenly 
than I the importance of modern languages. The man 
who can read, still more the man who can speak one or 
more languages other than his own, doubles, trebles, 
multiplies almost indefinitely his capacity, his useful- 
ness, his efficiency and his enjoyments. I am, as I have 
said, an unregenerate person and I am glad that I had 
a classical education, but I have always regretted that 
I was not taught Latin and Greek by ear first, taught 
to speak them in the way all languages, spoken or un- 
spoken, modern or ancient, should be taught. No one 
will go further than I in advocating the study of mod- 
ern languages, but I am utterly unable to see why it 
should be considered a prerequisite to their study to 
displace the classics. They are complementary, not 
opposed, and in the higher education certainly the class- 
ics and the modern languages ought to go hand in hand. 
It was said that Von Moltke was able to keep silent in 
six languages, a marvellous feat even in one. But the 
power to speak after a fashion two or three languages is 
as common as Von Moltke’s many tongued silence is 
rare and is not incompatible with ignorance or illiteracy. 
There are also many persons like Thackeray’s couriers 
who spoke, every one of them, several languages “in- 
differently ill.” It is a pecuniarily profitable accomp- 
lishment in such cases and usually leads to success as a 
courier, a concierge, a hotelkeeper, and the like, all ex- 
cellent occupations, but not concerned with the higher 
education. It is quite certain that a man may speak one 
or more modern languages very well and know and 
enjoy their literatures without having studied the class- 
ics, but that is no argument against possessing also a
-P-A-G-E-121
ADDRESSES 113 
‘knowledge of Greek and Latin. Such knowledge can- 
not but help any man in the modern languages of Ku- 
rope, for they have all borrowed or have sprung from 
Latin and Greek. A man may easily speak a modern 
language other than his own almost faultlessly, but un- 
less he has some acquaintance with Greek and Latin he 
can never hope for real scholarship in the spoken tongue 
which he has acquired or for a thorough comprehension 
of it. The study and acquisition of modern languages 
instead of being a reason for the expulsion of the classics 
from our schools and universities are in reality the 
strongest argument in favor of their retention. The 
teaching of the one should always imply instruction in 
the other. 
It is also urged sometimes that it is a waste of time 
to spend it upon the classics because translations serve 
every purpose. The great authority of Emerson is 
cited always in support of this contention and there is 
no doubt that he gave high if undue value to the transla- 
tion. I am a lover of Emerson and there are very few 
who have written either prose or poetry who have meant 
more to me than he. But in that marvellous and splen- 
did intellect the critical faculty was not the strongest 
and there seem to be blind spots in the intellectual vision 
as there are in the eye. Emerson for instance spoke of 
Poe to Mr. Howells as “that jingle-man.” One may 
like or dislike Poe, admire him or contemn him, but his 
place in the long annals of English poetry cannot be 
denied nor can his extraordinary mastery of metrics and 
of rhyme, of melody and cadence and rhythm be omit- 
ted from the history or from the glories of English 
verse. To call him a “jingle-man” simply shows that 
Emerson was in those respects what the musicians call
-P-A-G-E-122
ree ee ere eee 
114 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
tone deaf. In a less degree the same may be said of 
his opinion of translations. A man far inferior to 
Emerson in all ways, but a highly trained and more 
discriminating critic, takes a very different view. Boi- 
leau said: “Do you know why the ancients have so few 
admirers? It is because at least three quarters of those 
who have translated them are either ignorant or dull. 
Madame de Lafayette, who had the finest intelligence 
of any woman in France and who wrote the best, com- 
pared a poor translator to a lackey whom his mistress 
sends to convey a compliment to some one. That which 
his mistress has said to him in most polished phrase he 
will render most coarsely and will cripple and mutilate 
it; the greater the delicacy of the compliment the worse 
will be the lackey’s version: there in a word is the most 
perfect image of a bad translator.” The same just 
thought is expressed more tersely by Macaulay, when, 
describing Mrs. Thrale’s anecdotes after they had passed 
through Mr. Croker’s hands, he says that they become 
“as flat as champagne in decanters or Herodotus in 
Beloe’s version.” 
These judgments on a large class of translations are 
much nearer the truth than Emerson’s paradox. We 
are all deeply indebted to translators and translations, 
for very few of us command many languages and no 
one all the languages from which we desire to obtain 
either information or the gratification of our tastes in 
literature. Yet it cannot be denied that in the change 
from the original to a new medium something, however 
impalpable, is always lost in the process. In the liter- 
atures of knowledge or mere information the loss is so 
slight that it may be disregarded, but in the case of great 
prose writers like Herodotus, Thucydides or Demos- 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
ADDRESSES 115 
thenes, like Tacitus or Cicero, it becomes very serious 
indeed. In poetry the loss in translation is not only 
much greater than in prose but it is so far reaching that 
many good judges regard the adequate translation of 
poetry as an almost impossible feat. Without going to 
this extreme it may be fairly said that many of the 
beauties of poetry and much of the delicate effect of 
versification disappear in the passage from one lan- 
guage to another and we can only accept the poem in 
its changed form as a last resource, which is no doubt 
far better than nothing. It must of course be under- 
stood that what has just been said does not apply to 
those great books founded on the ideas expressed in the 
poetry of another language which are miscalled transla- 
tions, but which are in reality new, creative and splendid 
works of imagination and style, quite independent in 
the adopted language, like the English Bible and Fitz- 
Gerald’s rendering of Omar Khayyam. Moreover the 
assertion that translations demonstrate the needless- 
ness of studying Greek and Latin proves too much. 
For if it is sound it would make equally futile the study 
of any language, native or foreign, except for the pur- 
poses of very restricted conversation. 
I have endeavored within the inexorable limits which 
time imposes to make replication of a general character 
to the objections most usually made against classical 
studies in our schools and universities. Let me now 
with all possible brevity try to give some of the affirma- 
tive arguments which can be made in their behalf. I 
will begin by quoting the plea made recently by certain 
distinguished men in England in behalf of the mainte- 
nance of classical studies, for in England there is the 
same movement against them as in the United States.
-P-A-G-E-124
  116 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
I take it from an admirable article by Professor Moore, 
published in the Harvard Graduates Magazine last De- 
cember. Speaking of the signers of this public letter 
Professor Moore says: 
“The list includes Lord Bryce, Lord Cromer, Lord 
Curzon, Walter Leaf, Sir William Osler, H. A. L. 
Fisher, Sir G. O. Trevelyan, Sir Archibald Geikie, the 
Bishop of Oxford, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, 
all known to Americans. Every lover of the classics will 
be glad to take as his creed their statement, a portion of 
which is here quoted: 
“Tt is our conviction that the nation requires scientific 
method and a belief in mental training, even more than 
physical science, and that the former is by no means 
identical with the latter. We might enthrone physical 
science in all our schools without acquiring as a nation 
what we most need, the persuasion that knowledge is 
essential to progress, and that it has to be acquired by 
the cultivation of the faculty of independent reflection, 
which implies the power of selecting, combining and 
testing the essential facts of the subject in hand. This 
scientific method is not the peculiar property of physi- 
eal science: all good work in all studies is based upon 
it; it is indispensable to law, history, classics, politics 
and all branches of knowledge rightly understood. 
What we want is scientific method in all the branches of 
an education which will develop human faculty and the 
power of thinking clearly to the highest possible degree. 
“ “Tn this education we believe that the study of Greece 
and Rome must always have a large part, because our 
whole civilization is rooted in the history of these peo- 
ples, and without knowledge of them cannot be properly 
understood. ‘The small city communities of Greece 
created the intellectual life of Kurope. In their liter- 
ature we find models of thought and expression, and

meet the subtle and powerful personalities who origi- 
nated for Europe all forms of poetry, history and phil- 
osophy, and even physical science itself, no less than the 
ideal of freedom and the conception of a self-governing 
democracy; while the student is introduced to the great 
problems of thought and life at their springs, before he 
follows them through the wider but more confused cur- 
rents of the modern world. Nor can it be right that the 
educated citizens of a great empire should remain igno- 
rant of the first state that met the problem of uniting in 
a contented and prosperous commonwealth nations dif- 
fering in race, temper and culture, and which has left 
so deep a mark on the language, law and political con- 
ceptions of Europe. Some knowledge of Latin is indis- 
pensable for the intelligent study of any one of these 
things, and even for the intelligent use of our own lan- 
guage. Greece and Rome afford us unique instances, 
the one of creative and critical intelligence, the other of 
constructive statesmanship. Nor can we afford to ne- 
glect the noble precepts and shining examples of 
patriotism with which their history abounds.’ ” 
The signers of this letter lay emphasis on the effort to 
“enthrone physical science” in all the schools, and that is 
the precise effort which is being made here. Should 
this plan succeed there would be no brother suffered 
near that throne, whereas the classics ask only their 
place in the sun and would never exclude any other 
study which leads to learning and knowledge. No one 
can have a deeper or more reverential respect for the 
higher sciences in all forms than I. No one can more 
admire than I the unselfish devotion to the research 
which, unglorified and almost unrewarded, slowly 
amasses the obscure facts from which the hand of genius 
will one day pluck forth the brilliant discovery which  
-P-A-G-E-126
  
  118 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
will help and serve and protect mankind. And yet, 
notwithstanding that all this is true, I cannot but be- 
lieve that to the average boy—mark, the “average” boy 
—it is as profitable to have read Virgil and at least 
caught a glimpse of the battles on the Trojan Plain and 
of the wanderings of Odysseus as to be instructed in the 
“Hereditary Hair Lengths in Guinea Pigs” or in the 
“Anatomy and Development of the Posterior Lymph 
Hearts of the Turtle.” 
But it is to be remembered that the higher sciences 
are not what the average man thinks of when he speaks 
of science. Nothing can be nobler, more elevating, 
more spiritually enlarging than astronomy, the con- 
templation of the stars and interstellar spaces or even 
of our own little satellite 
“The moon, whose orb 
Through optic glass the Tuscan Artist views 
At ewning from the top of Fesole, 
Or in Valdarno to descry new lands, 
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.” 
Here we have the first classical scholar of his time in 
words of imperishable beauty acclaiming the labors of 
one of the pioneers of science. Milton at least saw no 
reason for shutting up one field of learning because an- 
other lay beside it. As of astronomy, so the like may 
be said of geology, of biology, of the studies of plants 
and animals whence Darwin and his predecessors and 
successors drew the doctrines and theories of evolution, 
which have so served and enlightened mankind. But 
these are not the sciences which are thought of when the 
classics are decried. It is applied science which is in 
the minds of most men when they use the word. To the
-P-A-G-E-127
  
ADDRESSES 119 
mass of mankind science means the steam engine and 
the telegraph, the telephone, the dynamo and the motor 
car, wireless telegraphy and aeroplanes. It also means 
the submarine, the poisonous gas, the high explosives 
and all the new devices for the sudden obliteration of 
human lives. No one would think of belittling the value 
and helpfulness of these wonderful inventions which 
have beneficent purposes. But they all minister to 
physical comfort. They leave the soul of man un- 
touched. The spirit of man, that which is highest in 
hin, is not lifted up and strengthened by an automobile, 
or a traction engine, or even by an incandescent electric 
lamp. But the thoughts of men, of the philosophers, 
the moralists and the preachers of religion, of artists and 
architects, of the dramatists, the singers and the poets, 
whether conveyed to us in paintings, statues and build- 
ings, or in books, are the real forces which have moved 
the world. Applied science and ingenious invention can 
change and have changed environment and have altered 
the scale of living and modes of life. But it is human 
thought and human imagination which have led men to 
the heights of intellectual and spiritual achievement. 
As Napoleon said, it is imagination which rules the 
world in the end, not the inventive faculty or the ability 
to make money. Rome developed every comfort, every 
luxury, every physical advantage which the wit of man 
at that time could devise and which the wealth of the 
world could purchase. But none the less literature 
faded, art declined, the lofty aspirations vanished, bar- 
barian mercenaries filled the legions and the great em- 
pire fell and carried civilization down with it into hope- 
less ruin. Physical luxury and piled up wealth had 
reached the highest point ever attained, but they could

not save Rome because the Roman spirit was dead. In | 
our mania for quickening the work and pleasures of © 
life and rendering it more comfortable and luxurious 
let us not forget that the vital principle without which 
all these things are dust and ashes is to be found else- 
where, in the books where the thought, the soaring as- 
pirations, the imaginings of men are stored up for the 
guidance and the hope of succeeding generations. 
In the old classical curriculum, to take a concrete il- 
lustration, boys at a very early period and at the most 
impressionable age heard the story of Leonidas and 
Thermopylae; they knew what was done at Marathon 
and Salamis; they had read of the death of Epaminon- 
das; they realized that Greeks had died to save their 
civilization from the tyranny of the Orient. Passing 
from Greece to Rome they came to that larger patriot- 
ism, that devotion to the “Patria,” to the country, which 
has been the inheritance of all Western civilization. It 
mattered not whether the old legends were true or false; 
the boys of the elder day before they had reached their 
teens were familiar with Curtius jumping into the gulf, 
Scaevola thrusting his hand into the flame, Regulus re- 
turning to Carthage; most admired of all, Horatius at 
the bridge, and they recited vigorously the words which 
Macaulay put into the hero’s mouth: 
“And how can man die better 
Than facing fearful odds 
For the ashes of his fathers 
And the temples of his Gods.” 
Some boys whom I knew read a little Herodotus in the 
volume of selections in which they were prepared for 
college and there they found this sentence: 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
    ADDRESSES 121 
‘Hudas oracidbew ypedv dort ev te TH GARG Karp~ Kal 67 Kab

eTal. 
These are the words of Aristides to his especial enemy 
Themistocles on the eve of the battle of Salamis. 
Roughly translated they mean: “It is more becoming 
at any time and more particularly now that we should 
show which one of us shall best serve our country.” 
Within the last three months this simple sentence has 
seemed to me not inapplicable as a rule of conduct. I 
look with wonder and admiration at the filaments of the 
radio station climbing up toward the skies and take 
great satisfaction in the comfort of an automobile, but 
I find in neither the inspiration which breathes from 
this passage written down by a Greek historian born 
nearly twenty-five hundred years ago. To the boys 
who had all these stories and sentences drilled into them 
the result can be summoned up in Addison’s line— 
“Thy life is not thine own when Rome demands it.” 
With this idea the minds of the boys became thoroughly 
familiar. That the individual life was to be sacrificed 
to that of the nation, that it was every man’s duty to 
offer his life for his country if the need came, was re- 
garded as a truism and a commonplace, as a matter of 
course. It is well to have this conception of duty and 
patriotism looked upon as a matter of course, as some- 
thing not to be disputed, and there can be no doubt that 
the early saturation of the boyish mind with the classics 
had much to do with this outcome. They knew of course 
that the Romans were in constant wars, that they 
brought home prisoners taken in battle and conquest 
and turned them into slaves as the Germans are doing
-P-A-G-E-130
  122 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
now. They understood that Roman rule was always 
efficient, often harsh, sometimes corrupt, although it 
was not guilty of systematic, organized and wholly 
wanton cruelty and barbarism. These things might all 
be true but the final and deep impression left by the 
classics on a boy’s mind was of courage, fighting ability, 
a capacity for magnanimous deeds, and above all and 
more profound than all others was the classical concep- 
tion of a patriotism ready always to sacrifice self and 
life for the country. Hence comes my reason for say- 
ing at the beginning that the connection between modes 
of education and the conceptions of maturity and the 
conduct of life is neither fanciful nor strained. This 
boyish experience is merely an illustration in a small 
way of the manner in which the classics have acted and 
reacted upon character and impulses at an early age. 
The proposition holds true on a far larger field. From 
the days of Plato and Aristotle, whose influence has 
been deeply felt for more than two thousand years, the 
philosophers, the historians, the poets, the orators, the 
dramatists, the jurists and lawmakers of Greece and 
Rome have moved and often guided the highest intel- 
ligences of civilization and have impressed themselves 
profoundly upon the thought and imagination of the 
world. : 
That word “imagination” brings me to my last and, it 
seems to me, to the one all-sufficient argument for giv- 
ing to the classics an ample space in any scheme of 
education, especially if the education thus given ven- 
tures to prefix to itself the word “higher.” We may or 
may not agree with the Christian pessimist that “The 
world is very evil,” but there can be no doubt that it 
would be wholly intolerable if man was destitute of
-P-A-G-E-131
ADDRESSES 123 
imagination, unable to enjoy aught but the satisfaction 
of animal needs and appetites and utterly incapable of 
the creation of other worlds in which to find refuge from 
this one. For a race so cursed there would be no 
beauties in nature, none in the sun and moon and stars 
or in earth and ocean. There would be no beauties of 
art, for there would be no art. There would be no 
laughter, for humor cannot exist without imagination, 
and there would be no tears except those extorted by 
physical anguish. 
The earliest craving of man as we catch sight of him 
at the dawn of history or among the tribes surviving in 
primitive condition is for something which will appeal 
to his imagination. He hungers for the fictitious and 
the unreal and for the promise of a happiness after 
death which this world apparently can never give. He 
listens to the story teller, he constructs intricate super- 
stitions, he weaves from natural phenomena a mythol- 
ogy and a theology which suit his longings and his 
fancy, while his spoken, his only literature is poetry and 
not prose. As the imagination is keenest in a child, so 
is it strongest in the primitive man. Reason comes later 
and dulls imagination, brings it fortunately within 
bounds, but imagination never dies and it cries out for

pends and which sustain the spiritual life of man, are 
found in all the forms of art that have survived, in the 
temple and the cathedral, in the statue and the picture. 
But the great mass of the treasures of the imagination 
are the creations of the poet, the maker and singer; of 
the dramatist and the teller of tales, and these are all 
stored in books and are called literature. A very large 
part of the literature of the world is composed of that 
which we have inherited from Greece and Rome. Mr. 
Watts-Dunton divides poetic imagination into two 
classes; that of absolute dramatic vision unconditioned 
by the personal or lyrical impulses of the poet, and that 
of relative dramatic vision which is more or less con- 
ditioned by the poet’s personal or lyrical impulse. In 
the first class he puts Aeschylus, Sophocles, Shake- 
speare and Homer, and gives as examples of the second 
class Pindar, Dante and Milton; Sappho, Heine and 
Shelley. I cite this passage from a distinguished critic 
merely to show that to whatever heights you ascend in 
literature the Greeks are always there. Literature is 
one of the greatest forces in the world and always has 
been and always will be so. It comes to us with open 
hand, offering us knowledge, spiritual inspiration, the 
vast world created by human imagination, laughter and 
tears, happiness, sympathy, enjoyment, forgetfulness. 
Over a large part of this spacious kingdom of the mind 
tule Greece and Rome. Are we to shut that fair region 
off and refuse to boys and girls even the opportunity 
to enter it? Is it not wiser, as well as more just to 
them, at least to put into their hands the key which 
opens the gates of the enchanted garden to use or no 
later as they may see fit?

tion in reply, What is the use of it? What indeed is the 
use of poetry at all? If poetry must have a use in order 
to live I might reply: 
“The song that nerves a nation’s heart 
Is in itself a deed,” 
and that the verses of Rouget de Lisle have meant more 
to France in the past hundred years than many useful 
scientific devices. But this is too narrow a ground. 
Poetry, the drama, literature in all its forms, true art 
of every kind, cannot be discarded or belittled unless 
you are prepared to say that beauty is useless, that there 
is no utility or profit to be found in the words of the 
founders of religions, of saints or apostles, of philoso- 
phers or moralists; in the marvellous creations of the 
poet, the dramatist or the tale teller. Such an attitude 
seems incredible and few people dare to take it openly, 
although many whose eyes are fixed solely on money 
making secretly believe in it. But an education wholly 
destitute of literature and of instruction in the contents 
and meaning of literature is of course no education at 
all. It could not really exist because the most ordinary 
human mind conceivable would refuse to be deprived of 
all imaginative pleasures and would teach itself. If 
then we are to have literature and art as a part of our 
education it seems a grave mistake to exclude from in- 
struction the languages of the two nations which have 
so largely contributed to both. 
If we love knowledge for its own sake, if we would 
have scholarship and cultivation and refined learning 
among us to give a savor and a perfume to life, we can 
hardly omit the classics. After all it was the return to 
the civilization and literature of Greece and Rome which 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
opened to us the treasure house of modern knowledge, 
and it is well to be grateful if nothing else. But I am 
one of those who think that there is something just here 
which should ever maintain the classics among us when 
we think of what they are and of what they did for us 
of the modern dispensation. When I watch the at- 
tempt to drive Homer and Virgil out of the schools and 
universities I can not but recall the old, old story of the 
plant, or grain, or flower, which opens the rock to their 
lucky possessor and discloses the high piled treasure and 
glittering jewels. It was a widely diffused tale. It is 
found in the Bible, in the Smiris; in the Orient as the 
Schamir or stone of knowledge; in Latin as the saxi- 
fraga, and in the Arabian Nights as the sesame of the 
Forty Thieves. In the Middle Ages the shepherd 
strikes the staff, in which is the magic flower, against 
the hillside and the rocks open. He enters and finds 
the Princess who bids him take gold to his fill. He 
does so and as he turns to go the Princess says, “For- 
get not the best.” She means his staff. He merely 
takes more gold and as he goes the mountain walls close 
upon him and crush him. Usually the charm is a flower, 
a pale blue flower— 
“The blue flower, which Bramins say— 
Blooms nowhere but in Paradise,” 
and when the treasure-finder turns away, loaded with 
gold, the flower cries, 
“Forget-me-not.” 
In the plentitude of our present knowledge, so slight 
compared to the vast unknown, so ample if contrasted 
only with what has gone before in our brief history, 
when we leave the treasure house, where all these riches
-P-A-G-E-135

of the mind are heaped up before us, let us not forget 
the noble languages to which we owe not only all the 
learning of the ancients and the reopening of the road 
which has brought us to where we are today, but most 
of all the poetry and the beauty by which we are enabled 
to see visions and to dream dreams. 
Then let us recall the words of another great poet of 
another race, who says to us, 
“Where there is no vision the people perish.” ~

1. PUBLIC LIFE 
Wooprow WIiLson 
President of the United States 
We should have scant capital to trade on were we to 
throw away the wisdom we have inherited and seek our 
fortunes with the slender stock we ourselves have accu- 
mulated. This, it seems to me, is the real, the prevalent 
argument for holding every man we can to the intimate 
study of the ancient classics. . . . What you cannot find 
a substitute for is the classics as literature; and there 
can be no first hand contact with that literature if 
you will not master the grammar and the syntax which 
convey its subtle power. Your enlightenment depends 
on the company you keep. You do not know the world 
until you know the men who have possessed it and tried 
its wares before you were ever given your brief run upon 
it. And there is no sanity comparable with that which 
is schooled in the thoughts that will keep. . . . All lit- 
erature that has lasted has this claim upon us—that it is 
not dead; but we cannot be quite so sure of any as we 
are of the ancient literature that still lives, because none 
has lived so long. It holds a sort of primacy in the aris- 
tocracy of natural selection. 
Published in “The Practical Value of Latin,” p. 20. 
The desire of all who in recent years have undertaken 
the reform of college studies in this country has been to 
find some plan by which to give consistency to the selec- 
131 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  182 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
tion of studies which the undergraduate is nowadays 
called upon to make among the multitude of courses 
and subjects of modern instruction. That is the object 
of our plan, and we hopefully expect it to answer its 
purpose. Its object is organization: to present for the 
use of the student an organic body of studies, conceived 
according to a definite and consistent system and di- 
rected toward a single comprehensive aim, namely, the 
discipline and development of the mind. 
In order to accomplish this, and because the students 
who come to us and to all the larger universities of the 
country come with the most various and unequal prepa- 
ration, it was deemed necessary to make the first, the 
freshman year, a year altogether of prescribed studies 
and both freshman and sophomore years, years devoted 
to subjects elementary and fundamental in character; 
the languages ancient and modern, mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, logic, psychology, history and the 
outlines of English literature. Every student is re- 
quired to take mathematics, physics, logic, psychology, 
a modern language and one or both of the ancient clas- 
sical languages, as well as some drill in the language of 
his own English tongue. * * * 
And in choosing the subjects to be incorporated we 
have found ourselves inclined to concentrate as much as 
possible on subjects from which we knew that discipline 
really was to be got in the schools. Old subjects are, 
generally speaking, taught with more efficiency than 
new subjects. Teachers of the classics and of mathe- 
matics have an assurance and a perfection of method in 
every way more serviceable than the ways and means 
of training now at the disposal of—at any rate the ways 
and means of training now actually used by—teachers
-P-A-G-E-141
  STATEMENTS 183 
of the modern languages. The elements of such sci- 
ences as physics and chemistry are not taught in the 
schools with as much thoroughness and success as has 
been attained in the teaching of mathematics; and we 
would rather have well trained students than students 
merely versatile and variously informed, whatever the 
means or the medium of their training. 
The question of requiring or not requiring Greek did 
not detain or distress us. We were assured by exper- 
ience that students drilled in the full classical training 
came to us better prepared for success in college tasks 
than those who had studied only Latin and substituted 
a modern language for Greek; and we were clear in our 
judgment that the old historical degree of Bachelor of 
Arts, the only degree that ever has been stamped with 
something like a definite significance, ought not to be 
wrested to strange meanings, to the obliteration of all 
definition in the labels of graduation. We therefore 
retained Greek as of course as a requirement of all 
those who should enter as candidates for the Arts de- 
gree. 
From Report as President of Princeton University on revision of the 
course of study. 
Wuu1am Howarp Tarr 
Ex-President of the United States 
President American Bar Association, 1913 
I am strongly in favor of continuing the classics in 
an academic education. I consider that, in addition to 
the mental discipline which study of them affords, they 
are the most helpful in the matter of correct English 
style, in laying sound foundations for grammatical 
construction, and in furnishing a basis for the study of 
all modern languages.
-P-A-G-E-142
  184 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
I believe that the success of the Continental systems 
of education and of that in Great Britain establishes the 
fact that not only are the classical studies important as 
an essential element in the best liberal education along 
with mathematics, science, history, economics, phil- 
_ osophy and modern literature, but that the result of 
the Continental systems of education shows the practi- 
cal value of such classical studies. 
THEODORE ROOSEVELT 
Ex-President of the United States 
You ask me to say a word on behalf of classical 
studies in liberal education. I gladly do so. But first 
it is necessary to discriminate between the technical or 
vocational education meant to fit a man for one definite 
occupation, and the liberal or cultural education meant 
to give a man the power of high enjoyment and the 
possibility of high usefulness arising from a wide knowl- 
edge of the life of the ages that are past. 
A real democracy must see that the chance for an 
elementary education is open to every one. This is the 
first essential. But it is also essential that there should be 
ample opportunity for every kind of higher education. 
The education of the great majority, while the most im- 
portant problem in democratic education, is in no way 
or shape by and of itself sufficient. Democracy comes 
short of what it should be just to the extent that it fails 
to provide for the exceptional individual, no matter how 
poor his start in life, the highest kind of exceptional 
training; for democracy as a permanent world force 
must mean not only the raising of the general level, but 
also the raising of the standards of excellence to which
-P-A-G-E-143
STATEMENTS 185 
only exceptional individuals may attain. The table- 
land must be raised, but the high peaks must not be 
levelled down; on the contrary, they too must be raised. 
Highly important though it is that the bricklayers be 
excellent, it is nevertheless a grave mistake to suppose 
that any excellence in the bricklayers will enable us to 
dispense with architects. 
In this country we have met better than in other coun- 
tries the demand for general popular education, and 
there is now on foot a widespread and most useful and 
important agitation to better the practical type of gen- 
eral education by making it more practical, by making 
it more a training of the average boy and girl for what 
that average boy or girl must do in after life. The 
higher technical schools carry out the same purpose on 
a more advanced scale. Jaw schools, medical schools, 
agricultural institutes, engineering schools and all simi- 
lar schools for technical training are being improved 
and are increasing in numbers, and provision is made 
in universities in various ways for the development of 
this training for practical life. This type of education 
has a value which is so essentially commercial that in 
the majority of cases this value can be measured by the 
income which it secures. Such an education is undoubt- 
edly the type which is most important for the average 
man; and therefore in a high degree for the country. 
It is also that which is usually most attractive to the 
average man and to the public. In consequence, the 
general feeling tends to be, not only that this kind of 
education is most important for the majority—which is 
true; but that no other kind of education is very im- 
portant for anybody—which is false. I quite agree 
that it is a waste of time to force the average boy to 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
  186 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
acquire a smattering of classicism. The anti-classicists 
are right in fighting this sort of compulsion. But they 
will do infinite damage if they destroy the opportuni- 
ties and the inspiration for classical study in school and 
college. 
Your conference is called under the joint action of 
the classical and archaeological departments, with ad- 
visors from the other departments also. You empha- 
size the importance of classical studies, not in the least 
as all-sufficient in themselves, but as forming an essen- 
tial element, yet only one element, in the field of inter- 
est which includes physical science, history, philosophy, 
modern literature and many other subjects—but all 
studied from the cultural, and not the technical or com- 
mercial standpoint. You are entirely right. (Nothing 
makes a man more interesting to himself or to others 
than. that wide knowledge of men and life, that wide 
knowledge of the globe and of man’s past and present 
on the globe, which is given by a liberal or cultural edu- 
cation in which the study of classical literature is an es- 
sential element. Such study is itself a powerful incen- 
tive toward a general knowledge of literary, social and 
political history. Moreover, while an education of this 
kind is not primarily utilitarian (using the word “utili- 
tarian” in its usual significance) it often, as a by-pro- 
duct, serves utilitarian ends of capital importance to 
men of large interests, especially the interests of state- 
craft; while familiarity with poetical and imaginative 
literature, both English and classical, is of high value 
to every man who works in any field where it is de- 
sirable to express high thinking in language which is 
clear, simple and lofty. 
However, we must frankly face the fact that this 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
    STATEMENTS 187 
cultural type of education stands entirely distinct and 
apart from the type which equips a man for a given 
trade or profession and thus usually ensures a money 
return, and which, necessarily and properly, is the popu- 
lar and ordinary type. Cultural training—a liberal 
education, an education in “the humanities,” to use an 
old term—amust be taken simply for the sake of knowl- 
edge and character, and for the benefit of the common- 
wealth. It aids in giving to the commonwealth the in- 
calculable benefits of men trained in literature, art and 
non-commercial science; and it is also an aid to the 
highest kind of statesmanship. 
This does not mean either the elimination of the 
specialist or the mere return to the college course of 
fifty years ago. Most certainly cultural education ought 
to provide for the specialist, especially of the higher 
type; for the scientific man whose researches have no 
more immediate money value than had the researches of 
the Alexandrian and Syracusan mathematicians who 
twenty-two centuries ago laid the foundations of 
geometry; for the professor of Celtic or Finnish or 
Sclavonic literature who can never expect that even a 
handful of pupils will enjoy in the original the Cuchu- 
lain story, or the Kalevala, or the love songs of the 
Ukraine. No community can develop a great and many 
sided civilization unless there is an ample base of non- 
remunerative work. 
A cultural education must include the classics. It 
must not be based only on the classics. The Greek lit- 
erature is one of the two noblest literatures in the world, 
the other being the English. Latin literature as such 
does not stand in the same rank with Greek; but it pos- 
sesses an immense importance because the Latin civili- J 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  188 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
zation is the direct ancestor of modern Occidental civili- 
“zation, and because the Latin tongue was for fifteen 
centuries the cultural tongue of Europe. With one or 
the-other, and if possible with both, of these two classic 
languages and literatures every liberally educated man 
‘should be familiar. He should also be familiar with at 
‘least one of the great modern culture languages, such 
as French, Italian, German, Spanish or Portuguese, 
each of which has a noble literature. Every liberal 
course should also include a wide sweep of general his- 
tory and pre-history, for a liberal scholar should cer- 
tainly have vividly in mind the tremendous drama of 
man’s progress through the ages. A competent knowl- 
edge of science must also be part of any really liberal 
education. But this does not mean the science taught in 
order to turn out a commercial chemist, an engineer or 
an electrician. It means that the man of liberal educa- 
tion should be a man who in addition to a broad classi- 
cal training also possesses so broad a scientific training 
that the primary facts of the universe in which we live 
are vivid in his mind and form an integral portion of his 
stock of knowledge. The man with such broad liberal 
training is perhaps not apt to be a technical expert in 
any special vocation; for his training stands outside the 
most direct line to pecuniary reward. Yet he has a 
great place to fill, for he has been fitted to become a 
leader in public thought, and a true interpreter to the 
‘ people of the development and meaning of our civili- 
zation in its most important aspects. © 
~~ Of course all this does not mean failure to recognize 
_. the prime importance of vocational or trade training 
’ for the great majority. Technical education is essen- 
“tial to the work of the world. The vast development of
-P-A-G-E-147
        STATEMENTS 189 
education along technical lines meets an urgent public 
need. But there are other needs also. “Man shall not 
live by bread alone.” Certain institutions of higher 
learning ought to devote their attention to satisfying 
these other needs. It will be for the general welfare. 
In no other country is it so necessary as in ours to pro- 
vide fully, for those who have the chance and desire to 
take it, broad and high liberal education, in which one 
essential element shall be classical training. 
  Grover CLEVELAND 
Former President of the United States 
Grover Cleveland was educated in the Academy at 
Clinton, New York, taking the classical course in prep- 
aration for Hamilton College, but was obliged to leave 
before entering college, in order to help in supporting 
his mother and sisters. Consequently his classical train- 
ing was limited to his school course of study. After 
leaving the Presidency in 1897, the remaining eleven 
years of his life were passed in Princeton, and for the 
last seven years of his life he served as Trustee of 
Princeton University. He was unwavering in his belief 
in the indispensable value of classical studies, and held 
that any attempt to weaken their influence or failure 
to maintain them as essential studies in the college 
course would be a violation of the terms of Princeton’s 
Charter, which defines the purpose of the institution as 
the “Education of Youth in the learned Languages and 
in the liberal Arts and Sciences.” 
He recalled with satisfaction the clear thought and 
style of the old writers in “The Federalist,” attributing 
their skill in expression to familiarity with the classics   
-P-A-G-E-148
   
         140 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
and the English Bible. During the revision of the cur- 
riculum in 1904 he took a firm position in favor of re- 
quiring school and college Latin for all bachelor’s de- 
grees in the liberal arts, and Greek and Latin for the 
historic Bachelor of Arts degree. He often talked over 
these matters with me, discussing the arguments on both 
sides. His general attitude on college studies, based on 
his fixed belief in discipline and training, is well re- 
vealed in the following passage from his address de- 
livered in behalf of the Trustees of the University in 
October, 1902, on the occasion of President Wilson’s 
inauguration: 
“While therefore, as has been already intimated, 
Princeton will not be left behind in any real and effec- 
tive educational advance that falls within the limitations 
of her mission, and while she will promptly avail herself 
of opportunities which more completely fill the scope 
and area of her instructional responsibilities, all will be 
done solely to the end that she may, with the best effect, 
teach the learned languages, the liberal arts and sciences 
and religious truth. We do not give to these words a 
narrow and too literal meaning; but we hold that when 
broadly and fairly interpreted, they not only fix the di- 
rection and quality of Princeton’s chartered endeavor, 
but also define a service serious enough and comprehen- 
sive enough to engage always, and in all circumstances, 
the highest and best university work. 
“Tf new born impatience should ever demand a swifter 
educational current and be content with its shallower 
depth, and if the solid and substantial acquirement we 
offer should ever be discredited as unnecessarily irk- 
some, Princeton will remember that men educated long 
ago in accordance with her methods are still teachers of
-P-A-G-E-149
STATEMENTS 141 
the present generation; and that the lives they led, the 
students they fitted for instructors, and the records they 
left of their wisdom, are to this day dutifully acknow]l- 
edged as undiminished forces in higher education, 
wherever it has a standing place. We will not be con- 
vinced that the human mind has in these latter days be- 
come so fundamentally enlarged that a broad and use- 
ful education can by some pleasant process be easily 
gained, nor that the acuteness of the human intellect has 
so kept pace with the eager hurry of the time that with 
no toil or patient wooing an education worth having can 
be bought or seized and forced to do service in a vain- 
glorious and trifling pretence of erudition. If false 
educational notions should prevail, Princeton will bide 
her time until they are spent, and until saner judgment 
shall recognize her conscientious obedience to the de- 
mands of her charter compact.” 
Statement of Dean Andrew F. West, Princeton University. 
Rosert Lansine 
Secretary of State 
I am glad of the opportunity to say a word in behalf 
of the continuance of classical studies in our colleges and 
universities because I firmly believe that that particular 
branch of learning has been a most potential influence 
in the intellectual development of modern society. 
There is a prevalent tendency at the present time to 
exalt the study of those branches of knowledge which 
pertain to physical life. It is a tendency which mani- 
fests the materialistic spirit of the age and finds its ex- 
pression in the words “specialization,” “utility,” “effi-
-P-A-G-E-150
  142 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
ciency.” I feet that this spirit is assuming alarming pro- 
portions and is becoming a very real menace to culture 
which develops the nobler qualities in man and raises 
him above the sordid things of life. 
It is better to possess a mind trained and able to think 
in terms other than those of material accomplishment. 
It is finer to measure life by ideals than it is by accu- 
mulated wealth. 
I am convinced that the study of the classics furnishes 
a man with mental processes which he cannot otherwise 
acquire, that it elevates him above the materialistic and 
- gives him a loftier conception of the realities. Exper- 
ience has proven that acquaintance with classical thought 
perfects the intellect and makes it able to enter the 
other fields of knowledge with keener perception of the 
things which make life worth the living. 
It is my opinion that the extension of classical studies 
in our institutions of higher learning should be gener- 
ally encouraged. They are worth all the time and labor 
whiéican be given to them, because from them spring 
taste and refinement, the power and desire to enjoy the 
better things. These are characteristics of culture, and 
culture ought to be the chief end of a college or uni- 
versity education.

I am a firm believer in the value of studying Greek 
and Latin. Although in after life one may forget much 
that he has learned, he can never lose the influence upon

his character. Even a slight appreciation of those 
wonderful races from whom so much of our civilization 
has come, gained by studying intently the very words 
they spoke and wrote, tends to broaden the student’s 
vision and enlarge his understanding of life.

My experience in the practice of law and my observa- 
tion of public affairs have led me to look with regret 
upon the diminishing interest in our higher institutions 
of learning in the study of the ancient classics. The 
modern university spirit seems to tend to the elective 
system and to study in the scientific and more practical 
departments of knowledge. I doubt very much whether 
it is wisest to leave entirely to the immature yeuth the 
selection of his course of study. So also it may be bet- 
ter to train and develop the mind in the earlier years 
than to store it with knowledge, which may well come 
later. If the university is to maintain its proper place 
as the seat of higher learning, Greek and Latin should 
not be relegated to an unimportant place in the curricu- 
lum, nor their study discouraged. 
History tells us of the unequalled refinement of the 
Greek race in the days of Pericles. Only a few doubt- 
ful and imperfect specimens of the chisel of Phidias and 
his school remain, and the skill of Apelles’ brush is en- 
tirely lost to us; but the highest evidence of the art, re- 
finement and thought of that golden age has come
-P-A-G-E-152
    144 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
down to us unimpaired in the Greek language, the most 
perfect achievement of the human race. No better 
training for the youthful mind can be devised than the 
study of this language and the mastery of the high and 
polished thoughts which it has preserved. It matters 
not if in the resistless hurry of our practical age the 
Greek which we acquired in our youth passes from our 
memory; its influence on the mind will never be ob- 
literated. 
Even the advocates of the elective curriculum which 
requires no Greek or Latin admit that the study of 
those languages in the writings of their philosophers, 
poets and historians tends to produce the most cultivated 
minds and the highest style of composition and expres- 
sion. 
I earnestly hope that your conference will awaken a 
new interest in these languages, and that there may be 
a restoration in our universities and colleges of the con- 
dition of things when the degree of Bachelor of Arts 
meant classical education.

I perhaps look at the subject from a more impartial 
standpoint than many, because my own education did 
not include a study of the classics, and I have always 
greatly regretted that I gave time to modern languages

I regard an education which does not include a knowl-

I am of the opinion that the value of classical studies 
is seriously underestimated today. The usefulness of 
Latin and Greek half learned and soon abandoned is 
another matter. Wholly outside of their acknowledged 
literature value, classical studies cultivate the power of 
expression and a discriminating use of words essential - 
-to clearness of thinking. 
Viscount Bryce 
Former Ambassador from Great Britain to the United States 
I do not say that the classics will mbhke a dull man 
bright, nor that the man ignorant of them may not dis- 
play the highest literary or the highest practical gifts, 
as indeed many have done. Natural genius can overleap 
all deficiencies of training. But a mastery of the liter- 
ature and the history of the ancient world makes every- 
one fitter to excel than he would have been without it, 
for it widens the horizon, it sets standards unlike our 
own, it sharpens the edge of critical discrimination, it 
suggests new lines of constructive thought. Let no one 
be afraid of the name, “dead languages.” No language 
is dead which perfectly conveys thoughts that are alive 
and are as full of energy now as they ever were. An

Lorp Cromer 
Former Viceroy of India 
Late Agent and Consul General in Egypt 
Although a soldier and a man of affairs, he was a 
writer of first rate ability. This is demonstrated by other 
writings besides his “Modern Egypt.” Only a few 
years ago, after his retirement and when he was living 
in England, he published a volume entitled “Political 
and Literary Essays” which makes delightful reading. 
In this book he touches on biography, history, the class- 
ics, and problems of education, as well as current politi- 
cal questions. In 1908 he published a volume of para- 
phrases and translations from the Greek. But he was 
very far from being a pedant or academician. Those 
American educators who are sincerely afraid that mili- 
tary training and discipline may destroy our love of art 
and literature will be considerably cheered if they will 
take the trouble to read two or three of Lord Cromer’s 
books. And those who oppose the study of Latin and 
Greek classics on the ground that, being dead languages, 
they make a man dead to the currents of modern life, 
will find in the career of Lord Cromer a man who could 
read the Greek poets, draw up a financial budget for 
Egypt, decide a lawsuit between two peasants with the 
tactful judgment of Solomon, and, if necessary, com- 
mand an army.

I think Latin is a great educator and am strongly

that Latin is a good means of education are: (1) it is 
one of the best mental drills possible; (2) there are so 
many English words derived from Latin that it is of

I believe that the study of Latin and Greek has been 
of much practical value to me in my professional work. 
I am bound to say that this is somewhat more true of 
Latin than Greek, for the reason that so much of our law 
comes from the Roman times and so many of our legal 
maxims are phrased in the Latin language that to a 
lawyer a knowledge of Latin is peculiarly important and 
helpful. Greek has been of more value to me by reason 
of the training it gave me in a proper interpretation of 
words and phrases than in the practical use of the lan- 
guage itself. Of course this can be said of the study of 
any language, but the Latin and Greek are such accu- 
rate languages, capable of such precision of statement, 
that their study teaches men who must be accurate in 
statement methods which they might otherwise fail to 
learn. 
Samuet W. McCati

I compliment you upon the movement you have un-

revival of classical studies when so many of our colleges 
seem to be yielding to the notion that it is the main end 
of education to make a man a merely efficient creature 
fitted to do battle with the obstacles of nature and to 
produce with increasing rapidity the things he needs or 
desires to consume. Under any trade or calling there 
should be a sound basis of culture or otherwise the man 
may be made subordinate to the thing he does, and we 
are likely to see him as we now do turning upon him-

self the forces of destruction and employing them to 
blow up civilization. That basis of culture it is the 
prime function of our colleges to give. The languages 
of Greece and Rome form the best linguistic models. 
The diligent study of them and of the masterpieces of 
literature which have caused them to live so many cen- 
turies is the choicest instrumentality of intellectual cul- 
ture. It refreshes and sweetens the spirit and culti- 
vates the love of letters and the literary art which is the 
foremost of all the arts. To the extent to which our 
colleges shall withdraw from the field of liberal studies 
and become mere teachers of trades and callings, to 
that extent will they abdicate the high function they 
have been created to exercise.

I believe that the study of Latin and Greek, as a

study helps a man, no matter what his after life is, and 
also helps him by encouraging him to appreciate better 
good literature and good reading.

We are living in an age of specialists and it some- 
times appears as though accuracy is regarded as a ~ 
special course and that only those who intend to devote 
their business or professional life to accurate mathe- 
matical and chemical calculations are justified in paying 
much attention to accuracy. 
But when you realize that when a boy has been taught 
in the public schools and goes into the business world 
the first course through which he is put is one which is 
intended to impress upon him the necessity for accuracy, 
you will appreciate that this is one of the crying needs 
of the present system of education. 
It is for this reason that I vote in favor of classics and 
mathematics and for history and geography. These 
studies are more likely to insure accuracy than a slight 
knowledge of a great many subjects.

any subject, whether it be Latin, or engineering, or law, 
to be the strength and power which the student derives

The training which a man receives in one subject always 
enables him to master more efficiently the facts of an- 
other subject. 
I regard Latin as one of the very best subjects in 
which to receive training, and for that reason, if I had 
my college course to do over again, I should include, as 
before, three years of Latin in addition to the four-year 
high school course.

training for the boy who has chosen a business career. 
The business man’s day is prosaic, the men he meets are 
as a rule men of little or no schooling. The business 
principles he finds are not always in accord with his 
preconceived ideas of honesty; there isn’t much art or 
poetry in it all; and, unless he has something to fall

some such continual source of quiet comfort and plea- 
sure as a classical education will afford him, life will be 
a very empty thing. 
Henry R. Towne

I was fortunate during my school days in being well 
drilled in Latin and Greek (at one time under the tutor- 
ship of the late Dr. Howard Horace Furness, then just 
graduated from Harvard), and during all my life I 
have appreciated the benefit of this training because of 
the better understanding it has given me of the origin 
of our own language, and the correct use of words, and 
also because of its aid in the study of other languages. 
I think it would be a great mistake to eliminate the 
study of the classics entirely from our schools and col- 
leges. 
On the other hand, I would strongly advise a reform 
in the method of teaching Latin and Greek except to 
very advanced students. I would largely omit the 
memorizing of rules of grammar, conjugation of verbs, 
etc., and substitute therefor the methods now employed 
in teaching modern languages to beginners. This im- 
plies chiefly an understanding of the theory of the lan-

guage, the mode of constructing sentences, and the ac- 
quisition of familiarity with a large vocabulary of the 
words of greatest use, or of closest connection with our 
own language. Thus simplified I believe that the study 
would be made far more interesting than now to young 
students, and would not require more of their time than 
could fairly be appropriated.

CiarENcE H. Ketsry

I am glad to give you my view about the importance 
of retaining the study of Latin and Greek as a part of 
the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 
our college courses. 
I am not in sympathy with the elimination of these 
studies and replacing them with modern languages or 
other substitutes. The study of Greek, particularly, I 
consider as fine mental training as is to be had. Of 
course, on the theory that one wishes to find himself 
using in every day work through life all that he has 
studied in college, Latin and Greek, perhaps, do not 
seem to answer the purpose; but there is a great deal of 
nonsense about this theory, and my own experience is 
that one is directly conscious of using in daily life very 
little of what he studied in college. What he should 
aim at is the most thorough and accurate mental disci- 
pline that will train him to meet and solve all sorts of 
problems in which he can use neither the classics, nor 
the modern languages, nor yet his mathematics or sci- 
ences, but only the capacity which study of them all 
gives him to meet the requirements of active life. 
I feel very strongly that the substitution of things 
 
-P-A-G-E-164

that are easy and that come naturally to a boy, and per- 
mitting him to do only the things he likes, are failing to 
educate him as he should be educated. The modern col- 
lege graduate seems to me to have drifted far from the 
liberally educated man as he was defined fifty years ago. 
Very few of them seem fond of reading, seem trained to 
take responsibility or to be self-reliant and effective. 
I am inclined to believe that the greatest merit of 
universal military training will be to repair much of the 
damage that the tendency of the past twenty-five years 
toward the optional and go-as-you-please systems 
adopted by numbers of our colleges has done to their 
graduates, and that there is great need of applying to 
the growing youth some training that will make them 
respect authority, assume responsibility, obey orders 
and play a man’s part in life. 
Wuuarp V. Kine

I should like to say that classical studies under teach-

scientific studies, but fully as high. I happened to have 
an inspired teacher of Latin for four years at Columbia, 
and in Greek for two years; and it is very easy for me 
to trace to their influence a good deal of the facility I 
find in thinking as well as in writing. A man of tre- 
mendous genius may be able to carve regardless of his 
tools, but those who fall short of genius will succeed, 
largely, as they are expert with their tools. And aside 
from the mastery of language and the clarity of thought 
it produces, the incidental acquaintance with the philos-  
-P-A-G-E-165

ophies of Greece and Rome has been of more than lit- 
erary value to me. My experience has been entirely in 
the Trust Company field, but that includes some rail- 
roading and a good deal of law in addition to banking. 
In all these, a knowledge of human nature is more im- 
portant than of economic theory; I should say that 
banking is nine-tenths a study of human beings and 
only one-tenth science. You will see, therefore, that 
the study of the habits of thought of older peoples gives 
an excellent foundation for studying the minds of our 
own generation. 
Mortimer L. Scuirr

It has always been my opinion that the study of class- 
ical languages is of great importance, both as a form 
of mental discipline and for its cultural value. While 
it may be said that excellent translations exist which 
enable the study of classical authors to be made without 
a knowledge of Latin and Greek, there is no question in 
my mind that English translations, no matter how excel- 
lently done, cannot convey the atmosphere and the feel- 
ing of the original. It must also not be overlooked that 
Latin is the basis of both French and Spanish, than 
which there are no more important modern languages 
at the present time, and it seems to me to be apparent 
that a well grounded knowledge of Latin must be of 
assistance and of value to the student of modern lan- 
guages derived from it. I, for one, have regretted the 
tendency of modern secondary education to omit the 
study of classical languages or to minimize their im- 
portance. It might as readily be said that a study of
-P-A-G-E-166

algebra and geometry is unnecessary, as it is only in 
rare instances that higher mathematics is of value to 
the student in after life. Nobody would deny, however, 
that the study of such mathematics is the best kind of 
mental training and discipline for the growing youth 
and the same in my opinion holds true as to the classical 
languages.

tennis court, or for something better than the gaming 
table when his days of business activity are over. He 
can taste the gentler pleasures that await him in his

Latin assists in acquiring a good English vocabulary,

function of the high school is not to give the pupil a

The very growth of modern industries was bound to 
force a reaction. It brought a great, growing need for 
men—not experts, but just plain, broad gauge, clear 
thinking men; men of mental force, of personality, of

start things and keep them going; who can handle other

a good witness because I had so little classical educa-

because I better understood the shades of meaning in 
words from knowing their origin. If the little classical

that Greek was the most important of my studies. Dur- 
ing the years that he reads and studies Greek a boy 
gets certain standards that he uses all the rest of his 
life, long after he has forgotten grammar and vocabu- 
lary.

  164 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
Grorce Haven Putnam 
Publisher

The word that I am in a position to give in regard to 
the “value” of classical studies comes from one who has 
not been able, from personal experience, to realize this 
value. It is a statement of one who has been called 
upon through half a century to do literary work and 
who had been prevented by factors not within his own 
control from securing the knowledge of Greek and 
Latin and had, therefore, not enjoyed the advantage of 
familiarity, at least in the original text, with the works 
of the great writers of antiquity. 
It is my belief, from the difficulties I have my- 
self experienced in securing an adequate understanding 
of the languages and the literature of later times, that 
an adequate knowledge, first of the language and then 
of the literature of both the Greek and the Roman 
people, is essential for the intellectual equipment of any 
thoughtful person who desires to study the great intel- 
lectual movements of humanity and who aims to secure 
a proper understanding of the foundations, the causa- 
tions and the inspirations from which have been pro- 
duced the literatures of the world. 
In the case of a student whose time has been limited 
and who has had the necessity of choosing between de- 
voting study to Latin or to Greek, my own judgment 
would be in favor of the selection of Latin. 
I may admit from my knowledge of the literatures 
of the two countries, secured through the reading of 
English versions, that the literature of Greece is much 
the more important of the two. It is Hellenism that  
-P-A-G-E-173
  STATEMENTS 165 
has contributed the inspiration not only for the Latin’ 
literature which immediately followed, but for the 
thought of the centuries which succeeded the close of 
the Roman State. Latin has, however, interwoven it- 
self more closely, first, with the language and later 
through the all important factor of Roman law, with 
the law and with the literature of the nations that suc- 
ceeded the Roman Empire. 
It is difficult to imagine a man becoming a master of 
expression in English, in French, in Spanish or in 
Italian without a knowledge of the Latin which forms 
so large a factor in all four languages. The Greek has 
made the larger contribution to the thought of the 
world, but it is to the Roman that the world owes, first, 
its understanding of law and later the theory of the or- 
ganization of the state. 
The contribution of Rome, as far as it had to do with 
law and with institutions, can be studied, with a fair 
measure of advantage, in translations from the Roman 
text. But the service to be rendered to the knowledge 
of the shades and meaning of words in the languages of 
today can be secured adequately only with a knowledge 
of the structure, of the spirit and of the literature, of the 
Latin tongue. I judge that the loss to the spirit of the 
original in the attempt to secure from English versions 
an appreciation of the actual character of the literature 
of Greece must be very much greater than is the loss 
in reading in the English versions the works of the 
writers of Rome. If we accept the first contention that 
it fell to Greece to make the largest contribution that 
the world has known to the thought of humanity, and if 
it be true that the full spirit and inventiveness of the 
Greek thinker can be secured only by taking his word 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
in the original, then the loss to the twentieth century 
and to any succeeding centuries, in lessening the know]l- 
edge of the Greek language and the facility of reading 
Greek text, must be serious. 
Speaking, therefore, as an outsider who has some 
realization of what he has lost, I should give my vote 
for the retention of Greek for all students whose men- 
tality is sufficiently developed to take in the larger 
thought, philosophical, poetic or literary, of the world. 
I should give my vote for the retention of Latin for 
the instruction of all students, boys or girls, who have 
any aim beyond that of manual labor and of success in 
controlling material things.

1. Men who are leaders in professional and business 
life are trained observers. Many of our most successful 
business men say that their success is due to their having 
cultivated the power to observe quickly and correctly. 
The study of Latin and Greek develops an efficient 
power to observe and compare. 
2. Having the proper foundation in Latin, one can 
very readily acquire the modern Romance languages. 
From a commercial point of view, this is an exceedingly 
important reason for studying Latin. 
8. The fact that our own tongue is half Latin justi- 
fies the subject being taught in our schools. 
4. From the point of view of ethics, the study of the

Aszotr Lawrence LowELh 
President of Harvard University 
For the core of secondary instruction as a preparation 
for general education nothing seems to me to have yet 
been found so effective as the classics; nor is the famili- 
arity with the literature of Greece and Rome without 
great value to the thoughtful citizen of the present day. 
The problems, social, political and international, that 
forced themselves upon antiquity are on the whole near- 
er to the ones that we face, and still more shall face, than 
are those of any intervening period. The classics in the 
colleges and universities ought, I believe, to be taught 
far less as they have been in past years from the point 
of view of philology, and more from the point of view 
of humanity, that is, of the thoughts of men as indi- 
viduals and as communities, especially in their bearing 
upon present day civilization. Such a change is taking 
place, but it ought to be pushed much farther. If this 
were done, we might witness a revival of the classics as 
a living force in education, and in the life of educated 
men. 
ArtTHuR Twintne Hapiey 
President of Yale University 
It has been on the whole my experience that men 
trained in the classics did better work in law, in eco- 
nomics and in most lines of writing which require care- 
ful analysis than men who had been trained in other 
lines. . 
They had acquired a habit of looking at words atten-

tively; of finding out the meaning of difficult things for 
themselves instead of expecting other people to tell 
them; and of noting the difference between subject and 
predicate, between things assumed and things stated. 
I cannot say positively that this difference is due to 
an inherent superiority of the Greek and Latin classics 
over other subjects available for our use. It may be 
due to a difference in methods of teaching. It may be 
due to the fact that the boys who study classics have 
been brought up in the habit of taking books seriously 
and being careful in the use of language. But while I 
am not sure about the cause, I feel quite sure about the 
facts. 
ANSON PHELPS STOKES 
Secretary of Yale University 
I have duly received your communication requesting 
an expression of opinion as to the value of classical 
studies. In reply I beg to say that I am exceedingly 
glad that I studied the classics and only regret that I 
did not master them more completely. I did not go far 
enough into Latin to have Latin literature in the origi- 
nal mean much to me, but the better understanding of 
the English language which has come through a know]- 
edge of Latin has proven invaluable. I have also found 
Greek of vital importance in connection with my minis- 
terial studies. To be unable to read the New Testa- 
ment in Greek would be to lose both a pleasure and an 
inspiration. 
In general I feel that the study of the classics tends 
to encourage idealism, a fondness for literature and a 
capacity for apt expression, as well as providing excel-
-P-A-G-E-177
  STATEMENTS 169 
lent mental discipline and a certain background of cul- 
ture which is of much importance. 
I am glad that a knowledge of Greek and Latin is no 
longer considered an essential qualification for an edu- 
cated man in all professions, because the old standards 
which insisted upon this seem to me rather snobbish for 
a modern democracy, but I think that there is much to 
be said in favor of keeping at our representative historic 
universities and colleges at least one degree, the Bache- 
lor of Arts, with some classical requirement, and I feel 
that our civilization would lose much if the classics were 
put into the background. By all means let us experi- 
ment with new subjects of study and new methods of 
teaching, but not to the exclusion of trying to find the 
real values—both old and new—in subjects which have 
proven of worth to many generations.

Latin still constitutes the most thoroughly ordered

world, and hence the best of all known studies for build-

It is one of my ambitions that Amherst should do her 
part in realizing the possibilities of classical learning. I

the experience of the American people.

GeorcE D. Oxps

My belief in the classics is firmly grounded. It is 
- difficult, however, to give a brief statement of the rea- 
sons for the faith that is in me. Indeed, I have never 
seen a thoroughly satisfactory formulation of the rea- 
sons. My appeal is (as the good churchman often says 
of religion and prayer) to the experience of the race, 
and there is ample evidence that the race, or those mem- 
bers of it who have pursued Latin and Greek with 
earnestness of purpose and for a sufficiently long time, 
are from the standpoint of breadth of vision, insight and 
intellectual power the better for their labors. Disraeli 
says somewhere that with the passage of the Reform 
Bill in 1882 the Horatian period of English parliamen- 
tary eloquence was at an end, meaning, of course, that 
the newly enfranchised middle class electorate would 
be intolerant of classical scholarship; but the surprising 
fact remains that every English Prime Minister from 
1882 to the days of Arthur Balfour was a graduate of 
either Oxford, Cambridge or Edinburgh, with the sole. 
exception of Disraeli himself. 
Harry Aucustus GARFIELD 
President of Williams College 
I am deeply interested in the preservation of the 
classics in our colleges of liberal training. After all has 
been said against the teaching of Latin and Greek in 
our schools and colleges, it remains true that no ade- 
quate substitutes have yet been found, if the aim is a 
liberal education. 
It ought not to require long argument to convince 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  STATEMENTS 171 
practical men that the average instructor will teach with 
greatest success the subject in which the method of 
teaching is most exactly and widely understood and 
practiced, and that the language which yields the richest 
return in literature and liberal learning will best repay 
the prolonged study and contemplation of scholars. 
Of course classics have no place in a get knowledge 
quick programme, frequently confused with the long 
process of a liberal education; nor would I attempt to 
convince those who by temperament or experience are 
better fitted for the newer fields of intellectual activity, 
men of the intellectual pioneer type whose powers might 
never reach full strength in what for them would be the 
confining walls of an institution of liberal learning. 
Ricwarp C. Maciavurin 
President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
When the element of compulsion is removed from the 
study of the classics, the opposition of men of science 
and men of affairs for the most part disappears. Gen- 
erally what these men object to is the forcing of every- 
one to study something in which many have no interest 
and for which more have no aptitude. Some of the ob- 
jectors are irritated by the extravagant claims made 
for the classics as if Latin and Greek were necessarily 
synonymous with humanity, just as some are annoyed 
by the loud boasting of the champions of science. We 
may hope that little harm will be done by the extrem- 
ists who in education as elsewhere are less effective than 
most people suppose. As to engineering, in which I am 
specially interested, I hear from men of eminence in 
that profession a constant demand for greater lucidity 
and precision of expression, a greater insight into hu-

Lyman P. PowEiu 
President of Hobart College, Geneva, New York 
I am glad to state with the utmost earnestness my 
conviction concerning the importance of the study of 
the classics. 
I singled this out for special consideration in my in- 
stallation address when I came here four years ago, and 
we have had a considerable proportion of students, 
thanks to the attractiveness of the teaching of the sub- 
ject here, in Greek and Latin. 
It seems to me that the classics will retain their value 
for education as long as the aim is to make men rather 
than produce machines, to brighten and enrich the whole 
of life rather than simply make a living, to implant 
ideas and instill ideals as well as to impart knowledge 
and train for technical service, to keep in vital contact 
with all that is best in the past as well as meet the prac- 
tical demands of the present. 
It is a commonplace to say that language is the in- 
strument of thought and literature, its highest expres- 
sion, and therefore must retain its proper place in the 
curriculum of a truly cultural college. There is no 
comprehensive knowledge of literature possible without 
acquaintance with the classics. No one can understand 
the English language without some knowledge of Latin 
from which it derives much, and certainly no real knowl- 
edge of Latin literature is possible to one ignorant of 
the Greek. 
Finally a civilization which in this time more than in 
any other must call itself Christian has to draw on its

sources which are accessible only in Greek, without the 
study of which access to these sources is difficult if not 
impossible.

the great fields that were opened up to me as a result 
of following out those lines of study have meant every- 
thing to me. I think the problems I have solved in 
pure chemistry were made easier; and, indeed, the line 
of solution of these problems was determined as a con- 
sequence of the broad training which comes to one who 
follows the classical subjects through their various rami- 
fications. 
In later years of my life I have given a great deal of 
attention to historical subjects and I have found my 
early training to be of the greatest assistance to me. I 
am constantly falling back on my Latin and Greek.

A knowledge of the Greek and Latin classics is one 
of the means of understanding the English language, 
and is essential to an understanding of our intellectual 
and spiritual heritage, without which our knowledge of 
the meaning of the present is necessarily incomplete. 
Both of these ends are of fundamental importance. 
A knowledge of Latin and Greek and of their litera- 
tures is valuable not only as a means but also as an end. 
It is not possible to know their literatures intimately 
without knowing the languages, and the content of the 
literatures is of such value that one who is unfamiliar 
with it has never come into possession of an important 
portion of the world’s treasure. 
Henry S. Drinker 
President of Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, Pa. 
Of course, we are in sympathy with you at Lehigh in 
emphasizing the importance of classical studies as an 
essential element, not only in liberal education as com- 
monly understood, but as a necessary prerequisite to 
the education of the engineer, and I am certain that I 
voice the opinion of the great majority of our engineers 
of today in saying that we believe a broad cultural train- 
ing an essential requisite in the education of the modern 
engineer. Let me give you a concrete instance. 
We have all heard of John Fritz, the father of the 
steel industry in America, affectionately known among 
the mining and metallurgical engineers of the country 
as “Uncle” John Fritz. I knew Mr. Fritz intimately. 
It was he who, as engineer, went to France and to Eng-  
-P-A-G-E-184

land in 1887, and brought home the French and Eng- 
lish processes for the manufacture of armor plate, and 
who encouraged at Bethlehem the manufacturing of 
armor plate and high power guns. Mr. Fritz, while a 
great engineer, was an absolutely self-educated man. 
He never attended college, but he was a man of wide 
reading and information, and yet he was what might be 
called typically a “practical” engineer. I shall never 
forget that one day he said to me, “Dr. Drinker, if I 
had a son to be educated as an engineer, I would see to 
it first of all that he gained some knowledge of Latin 
and Greek.” 
F Isaac SHARPLESS 
Recently President of Haverford College 
It seems to me that the advantage of Latin and Greek 
consists in their ability to make students do serious, 
earnest, thoughtful work every day that they prepare 
the lesson. This sort of training is what is needed not 
merely for scholarly people but for business men and 
every one else. It is true that the training may be ob- 
tained by other subjects, and that the classics are not 
the only means of securing it, but they are the most 
certain means that I know of. My observation of re- 
sults is that classical scholars succeed because they have 
it and others fail sometimes because they do not have it. 
W. W. ComrortT

Joun H. MacCracken

My training in Latin extended over ten years, my 
training in Greek over eight years, and I have had no 
occasion to regret the time thus employed. The discip- 
_ linary value of these studies I can more readily recog- 
nize and measure than the cultural value. The forma- 
tion of taste and ideals “cometh not with observation.” 
On the other hand such disciplinary by-products as 
closeness of observation, nicety of discrimination, sagac- 
ity in selecting the significant element in a complicated 
structure, are more readily detected. 
The study of classics adds unity to our knowledge. 
This is peculiarly true in an age dominated by the idea 
of evolution, an age which places perhaps undue em- 
phasis on the pedigree of knowledge. It tends to cor- 
rect the subjective attitude of contemporary thought 
by the objective attitude of a simpler age. Dead lan- 
guages, just because they are dead, serve as useful ab- 
stract terms in the working out of problems in the social 
sciences, just as the abstract terms of other sciences, 
electrons, atoms, and all the family of a, y, zs have 
done much to build up knowledge in the fields of natural 
science. 
Classical studies are not for everyone. No one needs 
a telescope to enjoy the beauty of the starry heavens, or 
to rise with the sun to labor, or retire with the sun to 
rest, but classical studies are to the student of man, his 
thoughts and passions, a part of those larger lenses 
which reveal unguessed worlds, and make more intel- 
ligible even the workaday sun.

In response to your request permit me to say that I 
believe in the classics. They have a unique place in 
literature. I have always felt that the requirements 
for a complete education must include a thorough ap- 
preciation of language—its structure and its interpre- 
tation—and must above all things produce a habit of dif- 
ferentiating, analyzing and classifying. ‘These educa- 
tional requirements are met, I believe, in the study of 
the classical languages in a way for which there is no 
complete substitute. When combined with the newer 
subjects of the modern curriculum, as I understand 
nearly all defenders of the classics advocate, they pro- 
duce what I am confident is the finest type of training 
our colleges can provide. 
STATEMENT SENT BY BisHop SHAHAN, REcToR, 
in behalf of the Faculty of The Catholic University of America 
‘Washington, D. C. 
It is not necessary, for our present purpose, to repeat 
the well known arguments in favor of the classics; and
-P-A-G-E-187
  
STATEMENTS 179 
it certainly would not be easy to single out as a new 
claim any result of classical education, any grace or 
utility, which has not already been set forth by compe- 
tent writers on both sides of the Atlantic. It may, how- 
ever, be profitable to emphasize one or two points which 
are sometimes lost to view as the discussion thickens, or 
are deliberately obscured by the opponents of the 
classics. 
The first is that the issue no longer lies between the 
educational value of the classics and the educational 
value of scientific studies, but rather between different 
meanings of education itself. It is admitted that the 
study of the classics does educate, and we certainly 
admit as much for scientific studies. But when we have 
shown conclusively that Latin and Greek have a real 
educative value, we are confronted by the further 
question—Is that the sort of education which is needed? 
Having assumed all along that mental culture, ac- 
quaintance with the origins, contact with great think- 
ers, knowledge of the sources whence have come our 
English language and literature, breadth of interest 
and heightened power of expression—in a word, that 
the humanization of man is the end for which we edu- 
cate, we may be told that we are on the wrong track. 
Such, indeed, may be our end, but it is not the end of 
education. And thereupon we may be reminded that 
the very efficiency of the classics in achieving their pecu- 
liar results is one more reason for setting them aside. 
So, inevitably, the discussion widens out, and the force 
of each argument comes to depend not on its source but 
on the ultimate aim for which we educate. 
Then, in the second place, our contention is far less 
radical than that of our opponents. While they are 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
    180 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
bent on extermination, giving no quarter to the classics, 
we insist on proportion—on such a cooperation of all 
the educational values as will secure the best result. 
This much, at least, we have learned from the artes 
liberales; and by the very profession of our faith in 
them we are constrained to make place, and even com- 
fort, for the sciences as well as for the classics. Other- 
wise, we would have missed, as our opponents generally 
do miss, the basic element of beauty and life which the 
Greeks revealed to mankind. 
Third, there is nothing to hinder any one from se- 
lecting his own educational ideal and determining the 
respective share of the classics and of science in seeking 
its realization. We, for instance, might look beyond 
the present day and lay our plans for the year 2000— 
just as we might, absolutely speaking, cast out electiv- 
ism with all its works and pomps, and restore the Tri- 
vium and Quadrivium. But in our actual circumstances 
neither of these plans would be the part of wisdom. It 
is for the youth of today that we must make provision. 
It is with the present condition of the world, and with 
the conditions that are to follow in the near future, that 
we must reckon. Instead of dwelling on the history of 
education, whose verdict is all in our favor, or appeal- 
ing to psychology which is the counsel in our defence, we 
can, as the scientists demand, look squarely at the facts. 
The conflict in which the world, ourselves included, is 
now engaged, forces upon us these two questions: How 
are we to wage war? Why should we wage it? This is 
not the logical order of the questions; but it is the more 
convenient, since it is easy to answer the first, and the 
scientists will be quick with their answer. In fact, the 
answer is already given in the methods which the war-
-P-A-G-E-189
STATEMENTS 181 
ring nations have devised. The war, evidently, is to be 
conducted by the use of all those agencies which science 
places at our disposal—of all the contrivances for kill- 
ing that human ingenuity suggests. The soldier at the 
front is simply the instrument for the mathematician, 
the physicist, the chemist and the engineer; and the 
slaughter is great because modern science is in the ser- 
vice of death. Nor have we, in America, any other hope 
of success. If we are to win, we must have somewhat 
more of science or a larger supply of its products than 
our enemies can afford. In the technical sense, of 
course, we were not prepared; and our only assurance 
now lies in the fact that we had provided at least re- 
motely for such an emergency by giving science so con- 
siderable a place in our education. Suppose for a mo- 
ment that it had been excluded! 
Then turn to the other question—why are we at war? 
—and seek an answer for it in any or all of the sciences. 
Get a formula, or an equation, or a principle of mechan- 
ics that will prove the righteousness of our cause. Is 
there a compound known to chemistry in which justice 
is the chief ingredient? Is there a force yet discovered 
by physics that shrinks from treachery or recoils from 
cruelty or protests against murder? As far as possible, 
we shall use the same agencies of destruction as our ene- 
mies are using, or others more powerful. We shall use 
their armament and their ships as fast as we can seize 
them—for the use will be the same in our hands as it 
now is in theirs. But will we adopt their motives and 
receive for our own their gospel of hate? If not, then 
it will be simply owing to the fact that our education 
has included other things than scientific fact and law. 
Whether in the school room or outside, whether from
-P-A-G-E-190
  182 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
formal texts or from less technical tradition, we have 
learned that there are such things as right and social ob- 
ligation and the duty which one nation owes to another. 
We have yet in our mental composition some trace of 
the hwmanitas which the older learning instilled. We 
are consistent in fighting for the rights of man because 
the knowledge of man in his spiritual activity is of 
greater value than the knowledge of matter and force. 
We have told the world in explicit terms that our ob- 
ject is to secure the liberty of mankind, that we are: 
prepared to pay the price in blood and treasure and 
sorrow. But this implies that we have thought out the 
meaning of liberty, that we know on what foundations 
it must rest and to what dangers it may be exposed. 
Have we learned this by studying the physical world 
with its immutable laws? If knowledge were confined 
to the mechanical sequence of cause and effect in which 
physical science delights, what would it profit to talk, 
or even to think, of freedom for ourselves and for the 
rest of mankind? The ever increasing contrast between 
nature as a system of rigidly determined events and 
humanity demanding a larger freedom would not have 
been brought to view had classical culture been com- 
pletely excluded from modern education. 
Let it not be forgotten that liberty means more than 
the right to live, to go our way without let or hindrance, 
to be owners of land and makers of homes. It means 
freedom of inquiry and research, the right to seek out 
the ways of nature and lay bare the hidden forces of 
the world by using our senses and our intelligence to 
the best effect. And this precisely is the freedom that 
science demands. It is because of this freedom that 
‘scientific investigation has been so fruitful and has be-

come so powerful an agent alike for preservation and 
for destruction. But if an attempt were made to re- 
strict its scope or to prescribe limits for its inquiries, 
could science out of its own principles, or content, or 
methods, supply a single argument in behalf of its free- 
dom? It would turn at once to those conceptions of 
right, of liberty and of progress which classical educa- 
tion has preserved and transmitted. It would become, 
for the moment and for its own salvation, more human- 
istic than the humanists themselves. And it would do 
so for the very obvious reason that the scientist, like 
everybody else, is born into this world, not as a formula 
or as a machine, but as aman. 
It may, of course, be objected that having inherited 
our notions of right and freedom, with all the rest that 
the past could give us, we have no longer any need of 
history or of the classical tongues, the vehicles of trans- 
mission. We can discard the tree and live by its fruit. 
Such a view is possible. But then it would be equally 
reasonable and quite as practical for the aims of educa- 
tion to declare that so long as we know the effects we 
need not concern ourselves about the causes, or that 
provided we get the answer, as the school boy would 
say, we can dispense with the principle and process. 
So it turns out that the plea for the classics is in reali- 
ty a plea for science itself. For, after all, science is 
only one form of man’s striving toward the truth with 
a divinely given impulse. Its light is not for itself 
alone, and surely not for the influencing of the physical 
world, but rather for the guidance of man in the attain- 
ment of his destiny, for his defence in the struggle for 
freedom and his progress in the ways of peace.

  184 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
H. Tucker Granam 
President of Hampden-Sidney College, Virginia 
I feel that the continuance of the classics as an essen- 
tial element in the curriculum of every college of liberal 
arts is of the highest importance. While a man may 
secure a scientific education without a knowledge of the 
classics, it seems to me to be a contradiction in terms to 
claim that one is liberally educated who has never come 
into personal touch with the great masters of ancient 
thought—“‘those dread and sceptred sovereigns, who still 
rule our spirits from their urns.” Nor do I believe that 
a man can become an accurate and accomplished Eng- 
lish scholar without at least a reasonable acquaintance 
with either Greek or Latin, and preferably both of these 
languages. 
Any movement, therefore, which tends to foster these 
studies and which aims to give to the classics their right- 
ful value in the eyes of an all too utilitarian public 
commands my hearty sympathy and cooperation. 
Cuar.es F. THwine 
President of Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 
To me one of the chief values of the study of the 
classics is founded in the contribution which the Latin 
and the Greek races have made to modern civilization. 
Four forces or conditions there are which have directly 
contributed to the best part of modern life, the Greek, 
the Roman, the Hebrew and the Anglo-Saxon. The 
Greek in its teaching of beauty, proportion, wisdom; 
the Roman in its offering of government and of law; 
the Hebrew in its sacred books and personalities; the 
Anglo-Saxon in its example of liberty, have given
-P-A-G-E-193
STATEMENTS 185 
fundamental elements and relations to our western civi- 
lization. A literature, therefore, which represents these 
primary conceptions of the Greek people or the Roman 
cannot fail to be of the greatest worth. 
Henry C. Kine 
President of Oberlin College 
Perhaps I cannot do better, in the way of answer to 
your request, than to quote a few sentences from a re- 
cent address of mine, on “What the College Stands 
For”: “The college owes to its students some genetic 
understanding of the civilization in which they live. Our 
western civilization is in the direct line of intellectual, 
moral and religious descent from ancient Greece and 
Rome and Judea. Our roots in philosophy and liter- 
ature and art go back to Greece (and in less degree to 
Rome), in law to Rome, and in religion to Judea. We 
shall not understand ourselves if we forget them. The 
college may be held, therefore, as bound to introduce its 
students to the significance of the great lines of inheri- 
tance of western civilization—Greek, Roman and 
Jewish.”

It gives me pleasure to add my testimony to the value 
of the classics in modern education. Not that both or 
either of the classic languages should be required of all 
the youth. In a democratic state like ours, whose 
preservation depends on the education of the whole peo- 
ple, the indispensable studies would not go far beyond 
English. But for those whose aim for themselves and 
their children is leadership or the companionship of
-P-A-G-E-194

186 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
leaders in their chosen profession and in educated so- 
ciety, more than the essentials is needed. The man who 
is to enjoy the respect and honor of the community 
must have in him more than the minimum requirements 
of his trade, more than that smattering of general in- 
formation that will keep him from being called an ig- 
noramu’. It is reserve of power that at all times in- 
spires confidence and in the day of need brings results. 
This reserve of power the pursuit of the classics, it seems 
to me, gives in a preeminent degree. From the pur- 
suit of the classics come, probably as from no other 
studies, concentration, discrimination, strengthened 
memory, orderly habit, exact expression, power to con- 
- quer difficulty, above all the feeling for getting things 
right, and at the same time a knowledge is gained of the 
sources of our civilization, and acquaintance with those 
primal men whose spirit has permeated the ages and still 
lives productive today. In a word, on the one side 
comes power to think; on the other, knowledge of the 
basic material with which our thinking is concerned. 
And to that is added the purification and elevation of 
spirit that follows the contemplation of beauty, the ideal 
of how to live that is beyond the knowledge of how to 
make a living.

In addition to what is commonly said concerning th

Harry Burns Hutcuins 
Former Dean of the Law School 
President of the University of Michigan 
A distinguished English judge has said that a case

the suggestion. One of the difficult tasks of the law 
teacher is to get from the students a clear, concise and 
definite statement of the facts of the case that is to form 
the basis of the discussion, and in this part of the work 
the noticeable superiority of the classically trained stu- 
dent is apparent. 
Epmunp J. JAMES

I am especially pleased to have an opportunity to add 
my small testimony to the value of classical study. 
I have of late years with an increasing interest at- 
tempted to canvass the influences of different elements 
in my education upon my qualifications for the particu- 
lar work which has fallen to my lot during the last 
thirty-five years. 
I think I would prefer to have dropped out of my life 
and thought and work any other element in my educa- 
tion rather than to lose the things which the study of 
Greek brought to me. 
Of course I should except English with the things 
that go with that, but on the whole, aside from English, 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  188 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
I have always thought I got more power of drawing 
fine distinctions, of seeing things clearly, of expressing 
myself so that other people could understand me, 
of insight into certain phases of human life and human 
history, and of inspiration for everything that was worth 
while being inspired for, out of my Greek study than 
out of any other single study extending over a similar 
length of time and taking a similar amount of energy; 
and while my facility in reading Greek has become very 
slight, I find when taking up my Homer or Plato that 
I am still able to get inspiration and help from com- 
munion with the Greek spirit and Greek ideas. 
It is quite a distinctly different value which I got 
from my study of Latin, which was more extensive in 
time than my study of Greek. The study of Roman 
history—which I am sure I should never have been able 
to understand in any such way as I think I understand 
it without the study of Latin stretching over six years— 
has been to me an abiding source of strength for all my 
work. The study of a civilization which in a certain 
sense represents to us a closed cycle is full of helpful 
suggestions. At least it has been so to me, and I am 
free to say that the study of Roman institutions, Roman 
law, Roman history, Roman life, has been distinctly 
more valuable than a corresponding study of things 
German, to which I have also given much attention and 
from which I have derived great benefit. 
I do not know, of course, what is to become of classi- 
cal study in this country, but personally I should regard 
it as a great blow to the development of some of the 
finest and most important sides of American life if the 
study of Greek and Latin should fall to the relatively 
unimportant place now occupied by the study of As-

syrian and Babylonian, as some people think it is bound 
to do. 
I think one is oftentimes inclined to attribute what- 
ever small success he may have had in any line to the 
wrong causes, and this may be true of myself, as I am 
sure it is of many of my friends and colleagues whose 
ideas on such matters seem to me very erroneous, but I 
have felt very distinctly that in the preparation for the 
work I have been called upon to do—a somewhat varied 
one from a pedagogical point of view—the study of 
Greek and Latin grammar and Greek and Roman his- 
tory and Greek and Roman literature was one of the 
most valuable elements. 
I wish you great success in keeping before the Ameri- 
can people the importance of these things in the pres- 
ence of such retrograde tendencies as it seems to me 
some of our most prominent pedagogues are displaying. 
M. L. Burron 
President of the University of Minnesota 
That classical studies have been of very great value 
to many persons is simply a matter of fact, and not of 
opinion. Their value moreover has not been purely 
cultural but intensely practical. That multitudes of 
students who have pursued classical courses have not 
shared very fully in these values seems equally certain. 
The vital question in regard to the classics, therefore, 
so far as it concerns our colleges and universities, cen- 
tres upon the position which is given the classical 
studies. It would seem to be wise not to require all 
types of students to pursue the classics, but to make 
sure that all those who have the interest in and aptitude  
-P-A-G-E-198

for such studies should be afforded the very best oppor-

of the languages and a vital appreciation of the culture 
which they represent.

Your request for a brief statement regarding my

training, a privilege which has so amplified and enriched 
my life that I cannot adequately express the obligation 
I feel to those who directed me in this course. And, 
secondly, I desire to say that I feel increasingly, as the 
years go by, the importance of such training not only in 
the establishment of a large sense of human values, but 
also as creating those habits of accuracy and logic which 
are the basis of the whole scientific process. 
Sm Wi11amM PETERSON 
Principal of McGill University, Montreal 
The appearance of Mr. R. W. Livingstone’s book 
entitled “A Defence of Classical Education” (Mac-
-P-A-G-E-199
  
STATEMENTS 191 
millan 1916) is highly opportune. There is a popular 
impression that the war is going to turn us from the 
classics to things that are said really to count, such as, 
for instance, ideally perfect processes for the manufac- 
ture of high explosives! We hear much of the neglect 
of science and there is a demand for educational recon- 
struction on the most radical lines. But the truth seems 
to be that while Germany has certainly not neglected 
physical science her school curriculum continues to take 
more account of Latin and Greek than is the case either 
in England or in America. This is how Mr. Living- 
stone, in his Introduction, scores the point that educa- 
tion in “scientific”? Germany is really predominantly 
classical: 
(1) The makers of the greatness of modern Ger- 
many are the generations educated before 1900; the vast 
majority of these were educated in the classical Gym- 
nasium with its compulsory Latin and Greek. 
(2) Even in 1911, of over 400,000 boys receiving 
secondary education in Germany, 240,000 were at 
schools in which Latin is compulsory, and 170,000 of 
these at schools where Greek is compulsory also. 
(8) In the remaining, purely “modern” Realschulen, 
so far from physical science occupying the chief place 
in the curriculum, only two hours out of twenty-five a 
week are allotted to it in the lowest forms and six out of 
thirty-one in the highest. 
No doubt the whole subject is hampered by consider- 
ations of what is practically possible within the limita- 
tions of the school curriculum and in view of the claims 
quite properly urged on behalf of new subjects; but it 
may still be doubted whether any better foundation of 
training, even for the young scientific worker, can be
-P-A-G-E-200

provided than that which the classical languages supply. 
In the higher reaches the question is almost outside the 
sphere of controversy; there is no better source of light 
and stimulus than the study of the literature, philos- 
ophy, history and art of the classical nations of an- 
tiquity. But even in the lower stages the process of 
learning, say Latin grammar, has an educational value 
of its own. Even an elementary knowledge of this 
subject is the best key to all language study, and there 
is little danger that a capable boy who has been compe- 
tently taught what may be called the “logic of grammar” 
through the Latin will ever reveal himself as illiterate 
in the use of English. The trouble on this continent is 
that there is a considerable tendency to belittle language 
study in general. Yet who can doubt that Mr. Living- 
stone is right in his view that “not to know Latin is to 
have missed an admirable training in precise and logi- 
cal thought,” and that especially in view of the slipshod 
character of much of our current English speaking and 
writing, it is a “perpetual discipline of accuracy in 
thought and word, and a rod for the back of journalistic 
chattering”’? 
My own review of the whole discussion, and the con- 
fession of my faith, may be found by those interested in 
a paper entitled “The Claims of Classical Study in 
Modern Education” which forms part of a volume of 
essays recently published.* I shall conclude by re- 
peating the words used, not long before his lamented 
death, by that great teacher and eminent writer, Samuel 
Henry Butcher: “So long as there is felt to be any dis- 
tinction between education and apprenticeship, between 
training of the mind and preparing for a profession, 
between disciplined intellect and sharpening of the wits,

so long will the classics remain, I do not say as the only 
instrument, but as an incomparable instrument in a 
liberal education.” 
Sir Ropert ALEXANDER F'ALCONER 
President of the University of Toronto 
Classical studies afford a unique mental discipline in 
the realms of thought and language. One of the most 
pressing intellectual and moral needs of the modern 
world is precision in thought and an exact use of words. 
We realize what we mean when we fit what we have to 
say with the proper expression. Hitherto no better 
means have been devised for providing such a training 
in the use of language than the study of Latin and 
Greek. 
Greece and Rome present in combination a finely bal- 
anced manhood. In no literature are the fundamental 
problems of philosophy, morals, politics and history an- 
alyzed with greater incisiveness; and in the epic, drama 
and oratory standards of art in life are presented in 
their most perfect form. 
The Greek and the Roman worlds along with the 
Hebrew underlie most of what is best in our present 
civilization; for this reason in order to understand even 
our modern life the educated man should be acquainted 
with the contributions made by Greece and Rome.

Princeton and in our own university. It is still an un- 
answered question what good substitute the opponents 
of classical education could offer for the study of the 
classics, especially of Latin. 
At the same time, I think that it should now be re- 
garded as worthy at least of serious consideration 
whether some acquaintance with Greek and Latin lit- 
erature and history might not be acquired through Eng- 
lish translations by those who have not had an oppor- 
tunity of studying the original languages, or of acquir- 
ing sufficient familiarity with them to derive real benefit 
and enjoyment from them. 
Enear Opet Loverr 
President of the Rice Institute 
Houston, Texas 
So long as men love learning, classical studies will 
live. So long as men seek truth will the spirit and 
service of science endure. And in beauty and holiness, 
religion and art will outlast them all. These are the 
elements of a civilization that traces its origins to Pales- 
tine and Greece, and finds its sources in the mingling 
of streams from Athens and Sion through Rome. Three 
main currents of that civilization—the Rise of Chris- 
tianity, the Revival of Learning, the Rise of Modern 
Science—each in its turn the new knowledge in conflict 
temporarily with the old, have contributed to the com- 
mon knowledge of cultivated persons in all civilized 
lands. An education that would not draw heavily from 
this common stock could hardly be called liberal either 
in letters, science, or art.

The Phillips Exeter Academy has always stood for 
what may be called the old fashioned classical education. 
We realize that wheré there is no change, there is no

requirements in Latin and Greek which have consti- 
tuted an important part of the work in The Phillips 
Exeter Academy, and which have formed a tradition in 
the school, are one of the great assets of the school at the 
present time. Until certain studies have proved them-

cultural and in a disciplinary way, the curriculum of 
The Phillips Exeter Academy will continue along the

I have been a schoolmaster for twenty-five years and

classics, especially on the part of departments of public 
instruction, and in connection with the high schools. 
‘Vocational studies such as mechanic arts, domestic

tion on the “bread and butter” basis or on the so-called 
practical basis. I personally do not subscribe to the en- 
tire abandonment of a belief in mental discipline. 
Whether power can be transferred or not, I think I 
can see that something has taken place in the minds of 
boys and girls who have had four years of Latin and 
three years of Greek. There is a strength and grasp of 
mental power in the majority of those who have had a 
classical training that is not found in the majority of 
those who have taken a so-called vocational or non- 
classical course. If Daniel Webster were in the schools 
of Salisbury today, a town not far from where I write, 
he would be advised to take an agricultural course as the 
course most likely to fit him for his probable environ- 
ment. Instead of that somebody advised and encour- 
aged him to go on and get a classical education and 
graduate from Phillips Exeter Academy and from 
Dartmouth College. Daniel Webster might have made 
an eminent New Hampshire farmer, but most of us 
New Hampshire people like to believe that he was more 
useful to the nation for the training which he received 
and the subsequent career that he followed and the in- 
fluence that he achieved. 
I notice a lack not only in pupils who have not had 
a classical training but in candidates for teachers’ posi- 
tions and in young teachers who have come from col- 
lege with little or no training in Latin and Greek. This 
is apparent in certain very obvious errors in the use of 
English, particularly in reading and in the pronuncia- 
tion of names and words that would be very familiar to 
every student of the classics. 
In short, I can not see how one can well understand 
English literature unless he has had some training and * 
experience in classical studies.

Head Master of Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts 
I regret that I cannot make any brief statement on 
the value of classical studies. My sermon would be 
long and tedious. I ama prejudiced witness. For two 
hundred eighty years both Greek and Latin were re- 
quired of every boy in this school and we who are 
steeped in the school’s atmosphere, who value its influ- 
ence and the effect of its traditions, are sure that its 
classical course is responsible in great measure for the 
high degree of success that its graduates have attained. 
Three years ago, we yielded to the pressure of the times 
and admitted German into our course as an alternative 
for Greek, but it has by no means supplanted Greek in 
the school and at the present time, as shown by our 
yearly elections, the favor of the boys is very evenly di- 
vided between the two languages. 
There is no trait of man so preeminently human as 
his faculty of speech, and we study the classics because 
they are the humanities of our forefathers. No man can 
get a just appreciation of this day’s civilization without 
a glimpse at least of the glorious past and a breath of its 
atmosphere. We study the classics to develop our lan- 
guage sense, to add refinement and happiness to life, to 
develop intellectual and spiritual taste, and to make us 
men stronger than our fathers, as the world demands. 
Ernest G. Hapcoop

Note: Dr. Hapgood has sent word of his complete sympathy with the 
cause of classical education. The following extract is part of a statement 
recently prepared by several teachers and forwarded by him to show the 
attitude of the Girls’ Latin School. 
Not only a flexibility in the use of English may be

gained by translating the classics but also a great in- 
crease in one’s vocabulary and a power to discriminate 
between the shades of meaning in English words, from 
a knowledge of their Greek or Latin originals. 
The memory, too, is trained, for it is necessary not 
only to learn all the common Latin or Greek forms and 
the vocabulary of the most common words and to under- 
stand the most important principles of syntax, but to 
have these forms and words and grammatical principles 
at hand, in order to interpret the meaning of the given 
passage. Just here we may note that another mental 
faculty is brought into play, namely the judgment; for 
the proper solution of the given problem can be obtained 
only by the most careful weighing and balancing of the 
different meanings and the selection of the one which 
seems best suited to the context. / 
Another result, nearly as important as those already 
mentioned, is a realization on the part of the pupil of 
the necessity and value of mental work, and a respect 
for intellectual effort. 
Furthermore, the student of the classics not only 
learns something of the history and life of the ancient 
Greeks and Romans, but from his contact with their 
writings instinctively pictures their surroundings and 
thinks their thoughts, is actually carried back to their 
times, and lives in their surroundings. Hence the im- 
aginative faculty is stimulated and strengthened. 
In conclusion, “It is no paradox to say that the educa- 
tional value of classical study consists largely in the fact 
that it is what the world calls ‘useless,’ so that there is 
_ ho temptation to subordinate it to unworthy aims, while 
on the other hand its true usefulness is beyond question.”

D. O. S. LowEt. 
Headmaster of Roxbury Latin School, Boston, Mass. 
One of the many arguments for classical studies is 
the fact that they are the key to English literature. If 
literature has value—and even the Philistine will 
scarcely deny that—whatever renders it more compre- 
hensible is also valuable. Who that has not drunk of 
the springs of antiquity can appreciate Milton’s poetry 
or Bacon’s prose, not to mention the writings of a hun- 
dred inferior authors? Can one enjoy oratory to the 
full and know nothing of Cicero and Hortensius, of 
Demosthenes and Pericles? or poetry, if he is ignorant 
of Aeschylus and Homer and Virgil? And so we may 
run through the gamut of all English literature since 
Chaucer’s day and find ourselves deaf to the harmonies 
of overtones and undertones, unless our ears are trained 
and tuned to catch the echoes of the ages past. 
It is said that we may know the classics through 
translations. That is either sophistry or ignorance. We 
may recognize them, but we shall never know them. 
Who can copy the Aphrodite of Melos, or a painting by 
Raphael so that his work will have half the value of the 
original? Yet such work may be much nearer to repro- 
duction than any translation of a great author can be. 
“Some there be that by due steps aspire 
To lay their just hands on the golden key”; 
to such the classics make appeal, and ever will, be their 
numbers great or small; while others will advance argu- 
ments (by no means new) to make the worse appear the 
better cause, and to prove that pinchbeck is more valu- 
able than gold. As Bacon says, in his “Advancement

I have got Mr. Sturgis, the head of our classical 
department, to jot down a few memoranda concerning 
the value of classical studies. I may add, for my part, 
that I endorse all that he says. ; 
In my opinion classical studies are today of penile 
value: 
1st—As one of the gabjdnts best adapted to develop- 
ing accurate and intelligent habits of mental activity. 
2nd—As an almost necessary foundation for the use 
of correct and forcible English. 
8d—As a necessary background for the appreciation 
of literature in general. 
4th—As developing in a select number of pupils a 
real love of Greek and Latin literature, which will be a 
lifelong source of pleasure and an inspiration to crea- 
tive work. 
Wut G. THayver 
Head Master of St. Mark’s School, Southborough, Mass. 
My experience of thirty years as a schoolmaster con- — 
firms my conviction that the need of the classics in liber- 
al education is greater today than ever. I shall be glad 
 
-P-A-G-E-209

to join in any protest against tendencies in education 
which would eliminate Latin and Greek from the train- 
ing of a scholar. 
Cuar.es A. BuFFUM 
Professor of Latin, Williston Seminary, Easthampton, Mass. 
Williston Seminary was founded in 1841 as a classi- 
cal school, and though we now have full courses in ad- 
vanced mathematics, science and modern languages, we 
still offer. full courses in Latin or Greek, and consider 
them indispensable to the best type of liberal education. 
We think that nothing is more essential to the man of 
-culture than the intimate knowledge of his own lan- 
guage, and the ability to use it with ease, force, grace 
and precision. And we consider the critical study of 
Latin or Greek the only means of attaining this end. 
We think that since mathematics, science or modern 
languages have so occupied the front of the educational 
stage, we have observed a lamentable deterioration in 
scholarship. It is only the exceptional pupil, nowadays, 
who manifests that eagerness and zeal for knowledge 
which is implied in the very root meanings of the word 
“study.” We believe too, that there is a refining influ- 
ence in. the study of the masterpieces of Latin and 
Greek literature. The pupil who has learned to appre- 
ciate beauty of thought and language in his Virgil or his 
Homer will be the more swift to recognize and appre- 
ciate beauty of form in sculpture, and beauty of form 
and color in painting, and so to become a man of good 
taste and refined sensibilities. 
Add to this the fact that no mental discipline has yet 
been found superior to that afforded by the critical 
study of the classics, and we have reason enough to claim 
 
-P-A-G-E-210

that classical studies should occupy a prominent part 
in the training of a liberally educated man.

   I am glad to go on record as a schoolmaster who be- 
lieves in the study of the classics—particularly Latin— 
as the only adequate foundation for the study of modern 
languages. As a means of mere training in mental ac- 
curacy I see no advantage in classical studies over 
mathematics, but the boy who would seek good success 
in only language study and who would desire to acquire 
a style at once facile, accurate and vigorous, should be 
thoroughly grounded in both Latin and Greek. I 
would make Latin a requirement for all boys in the 
earlier years of the preparation for college but I would 
not insist that they continue either Greek or Latin be- 
yond the “elementary” requirement in the case of boys 
who seek a scientific training. 
Cuaruzs S. Inenam 
Master of Dummer Academy, South Byfield, Mass. 
In this matter the position of the sehool is the same 
as it was a century and a half ago when Master Moody 
taught here his famous group of boys. In some way or 
other, using little besides Latin and Greek, he prepared 
men for great careers in all walks of life. As compared 
with the modern preparatory course, his students cov- 
ered but little ground but they knew what they knew) 
and knew that they knew it. 
We still believe that the classics give a great teacher} 
the best means of impressing his ideals and personalit

upon his students afforded by any curriculum. Most 
of us who have enjoyed the advantages of a liberal edu- 
cation look back to some teacher of Latin or Greek as 
the commanding figure among those who have taught 
us. I know this to be a fact in many cases. 
In fighting for the classics we are fighting for the 
proposition that the interest which abides is that which 
follows hard work rather than that which precedes it. 
In no way of which I am aware can we protest so ef- 
fectively against the shallow and superficial in educa- 
tion as by keeping the classics in the curriculum and by 
holding ourselves, our subordinates and our students 
to that high standard of work which our own teachers 
so consistently exemplified in their teaching of Latin 
and Greek. 
D. W. ABERCROMBIE 
Principal of Worcester Academy, Worcester, Mass. 
How far distant seem the days when, with the purpose 
to practice law, I still read Plato with George Herbert 
Palmer, Euripides and the Philippics with Frank An- 
derson, Cicero’s Letters with William Everett, and 
Plautus and Lucretius, strange contrasts, with George 
Martin Lane. As I look back upon those days, and re- 
call the men who with me received this training as under- 
graduates in Harvard, it is difficult to see how Harvard 
College at that time failed in its high purpose to train 
young men for useful and happy lives. The full scheme 
of its young president, it is true, was not yet in opera- 
tion. The classics were still enthroned, though elective 
after the first two years. 
As the careers of many of my classmates thus trained 
under the old curriculum are reviewed, there would not
-P-A-G-E-212

seem to be lacking energizing and man making material 
in the Bildungstoff of those days. Among them were 
Percival Lowell, the astronomer; Benjamin Osgood 
Pierce, the eminent physicist; Edmund March Wheel- 
wright, the builder of stately bridges, a modern Ponti- 
fex Maaimus; Oscar Roland Jackson, the chemist; 
Francis Cabot Lowell and William Henry Mooney, 
jurisconsults; Charles Franklin Thwing, educator, and 
Barrett Wendell and George Edward Woodberry, men 
of letters. 
These men, representing a modest Harvard class of 
the classical period, show a variety of power and attain- 
ment that would free any curriculum from the charge of 
inefficiency. President Eliot and the late Charles 
Francis Adams were together the great protagonists 
of the modern curriculum, the one seeking to turn Har- 
vard College into a German university, as the latter 
repeatedly charged, and Mr. Adams uttering his de- 
structive Phi Beta Kappa oration against Greek as a 
“college fetich,” and living long enough to see his mis- 
take and repent it. If memory serves me correctly 
Pierce, who at his burial was called “the sage and saint 
of the University,” elected a course in Greek in his senior 
year, profound mathematician and physicist as he was, 
to convince a group of personal friends that he was 
broad minded and that he sought culture along with the 
training of the exact sciences. 
President Eliot and Mr. Adams, who did more than 
any other men to slay true cultural training in the house 
of its friends, were themselves conspicuous examples of 
what great native endowments, touched by the humani- 
ties, can accomplish in the lives of men. The great 
president’s condensed, reserved, lucid style fills out the
-P-A-G-E-213
  STATEMENTS 205 
fullness of the measure of the Greek ynSev &yav, Thucy- 
dides never used a more chaste, coherent, convincing 
prose. Mr. Adams, during the days of his apostasy, 
never ceased censuring the Harvard that President 
Eliot succeeded in creating out of the college as he 
found it. He saw more clearly as he grew older, 
and recanted his heresy. But it was too late. The fatal 
blow had been given, and Greek was dethroned. 
A great geographer within the last month, with Ger- 
many clearly in mind, asked me: “Will science ever 
again be used for the amelioration and blessing of man- 
kind?” My friend’s question suggests how wholly lost 
from the great world of organized civilization, as we 
had fondly thought it, is the old Greek thought of the 
moderation in wisdom of our desires and our emotions, 
our cults and our philosophies. What have the chemists 
of Germany produced in their laboratories, out of minds 
bent on destruction, but engines of destruction, until 
German science has become almost another word for 
German ruthlessness?) How much has been lost to the 
world when we look on the resulting desolations that 
have been wrought through the loss of the fine equili- 
brium of feelings and desires of the ancient prime of the 
Greek world. “Will science ever again be used for the 
amelioration and blessing of mankind?’ And when? 
Turning to the patent results of the failure of culture 
of the spirit and mind, that lie all about us in the slov- 
enly and distressing level to which much of life and 
many of the expressions of human intercourse have 
fallen, we have only to note the decadence, almost the 
death, of polite speech, and consequently of politeness 
in most ways, as it is found today not only among school 
boys and girls, but in college communities as well.

“Where there is no vision the people perish,” is the suf- 
ficient comment. There has been little antidote to the 
influences of vast and widespread wealth and ease. The 
debasing low priced magazine and short story, the 
cheaply emotional “movie,” the whirling automobile, all 
these conspire to produce the cheap, purposeless boy 
and equally cheap and frivolous girl; and seemingly 
there is no adequate corrective at work. Milton and 
Shakespeare have no meaning and value, much less 
picturesque attractiveness and food for the mind for 
those who have no enrichment of vocabulary or taste 
through acquaintance, even in small degree, with Virgil 
and Homer. 
Wuuism C. Hit 
Principal of The Central High School, Springfield, Mass. 
I am glad to send you my testimony to the value of 
classics in the best type of liberal education. I might 
go much more into detail, but the above sentence covers 
my feeling in this matter. I have no hesitation in say- 
ing that my pupils who have had a thorough course in 
Latin are better off mentally than those who are with- 
out it. In taste, judgment and intellectual power I 
know of no other high school subject which gives equal 
results. 
Wun T. Peck 
Principal of The Classical High School, Providence, R. I. 
Webster’s New International Dictionary, edited by 
William T. Harris, is a work of incomparable value. 
It is meant for the use of all educated men who speak 
the English language. It would be a calamity if they,
-P-A-G-E-215
  STATEMENTS 207 
because of a complete ignorance of the ancient lan- 
guages, could not profit from a study of the greater 
part of its vocabulary as the dictionary presents it, de- 
rived from the Latin and the Greek. Latin, too, is the 
universal language of botany. Greek furnishes the 
basis of the ever enlarging vocabulary of modern sci- 
ence. As language is an endowment that distinguishes 
man from the beasts, its structure and development 
must be of the greatest practical value to him. Forty- 
five years of experience as a teacher have convinced me 
that there is no surer means of promoting the power of 
the intellect than the study of languages, especially the 
Latin and the Greek, which are not only the vehicle but 
also almost the very life of thought. 
Sera K. Girrorp 
Principal of the Moses Brown School, Providence, R. I. 
From my experience and opportunity for observation 
during forty years (twenty in college and twenty in 
school), I have no hesitation in saying that the record 
for business efficiency and professional standing lies 
strictly in favor of the boy with a classical training. 
Even if we admit that a part of this advantage is 
chargeable to superior mental endowment on the part 
of boys who have pursued this “antiquated and useless” 
line of study, there is still a large balance in their favor. 
If, in addition, we consider higher spiritual values, 
such as a man’s satisfaction with himself or his general 
usefulness in society, the case is still stronger. 
I give my vote, therefore, for the classics in education 
and shall continue to do so until I have more compelling 
reasons than at present for a change of mind and heart.

Grorce L. Fox 
Principal of The University School, New Haven, Conn. 
I doubt whether there is any one in active service as 
a teacher who has taught for a longer or shorter time 
more boys preparing for Yale than I have had as my 
pupils. If the future generation of youth is to be 
trained largely without Latin, I shall be sorry for them 
for what they have missed, and confidently predict that 
they will be painfully weak and flabby in intellectual 
work, painfully superficial and narrow minded, and 
painfully inefficient in becoming masters of the situation 
in dealing with hard problems in any professional work. 
Possibly my opinions on this point may not be wholly 
valueless, if I say that during the last fifteen years it 
has been my regular task to teach all the ordinary sub- 
jects, required for admission to college, except the 
sciences, including French, German, mathematics, an- 
cient and modern history and English. That has given 
me an excellent opportunity to judge of the value of 
different subjects in teaching boys to think, and I un- 
hesitatingly and vigorously record my conviction that 
the study of Latin is one of the best possible means for 
attaining that end which I look upon as the main end 
of education.

Epwarp H. Smitey

The Hartford Public School has, throughout its long 
history, believed heartily in the value of classical train- 
ing. It holds steadfastly to that belief today. After 
an experience of more than twenty-five years in the 
school, I can say in all sincerity that I believe no de- 
partment of the school has had so strong an influence in 
maintaining scholarly ideals. It seems to me that it 
would be disastrous to the cause of education if the ideas 
of Mr. Flexner and others of his kind should get con- 
trol of our educational work. 
H. G. Burner 
Headmaster of The Hotchkiss School, Lakeville, Conn. 
We think so highly of Latin at the Hotchkiss School 
that we require it of every pupil, whether the college 
for which he is preparing requires it or not. We think 
the practical value of a knowledge of Latin is not in- 
considerable to a cultivated gentleman. Entirely apart 
from this, we think that Latin is a better instrument 
for training in mental concentration than any substitute - 
which has been offered. We do not accept the theory 
that “interest” is the chief motive to be appealed to in 
education. We think that most men who work with 
their brains have to do the job which is set before them 
day by day whether they are interested in it particularly 
or not. We do not know any way to train pupils into 
the power of application except the old fashioned way 
of setting them a mental task and making them do it. 
For such training of the will as applied to study we like 
Latin.

Henry A. TERRELL 
Principal of the Norwich Free Academy, Norwich, Conn. 
The problem of liberal education—and I take the 
view that liberal training should be carried on in any 
individual’s career up to the point where efficiency de- 
mands specialization, whether in profession or trade— 
is essentially the problem of developing habits and 
ideals. The “Columbia” school, which insists that ‘“men- 
tal power is non-transferable,” cannot touch the truth 
that habits and ideals are universal, and therefore trans- 
ferable. 
For the development of right habits and lofty ideals 
no subjects have proved themselves so valuable for most 
young people as the classics and mathematics. Habits 
are formed and ideals are acquired not so much by direct 
presentation of thrilling examples of noble action as 
by the slow process of daily effort. 
Rotanp J. Mutrorp 
Headmaster of Ridgefield School, Ridgefield, Conn. 
It seems to me that the question of method is the im- 
portant one. The time allowed by the college require- 
ments is not enough for all the subjects; and the diffi- 
culty with our present education is in the number of 
studies. Too many are required, and none can be well 
taught or well learned. Superficiality is the necessary 
result. If there were time to teach Latin or Greek and 
a few other essentials it would be satisfactory, and it is 
not now. Efficiency is not the sole aim of education, nor 
materialism its goal; interest is most often a transient 
motive, and the elective system is not possible in schools. 
The fundamentals of education are the concern of
-P-A-G-E-219
STATEMENTS 211 
schools, and in them must be laid the foundations on 
which the colleges and universities build; a good founda- 
tion makes the rest easy. The diversity of the school 
curriculum is its evil; non multa sed multum should be 
its motto, and it is now the reverse. 
A very practical value of classical study lies in the 
training in a highly inflected language. Any other lan- 
guage is much more easily learned after Latin or Greek 
has been studied. The beginning of any language is 
difficult, and the mistake is in dropping the classics after 
the hard part has been learned. It is certainly worth 
while for English speaking people to learn Latin; a 
much larger vocabulary is acquired, and at least the 
distinctions in meanings and in the use of words are 
never lost, however much else may be forgotten. 
GrorcE E. QuAILE 
Headmaster of Salisbury School, Salisbury, Conn. 
Classical studies, if properly directed, make for care- 
fulness of expression and against slovenliness. An 
American boy may dislike the difficulties of ancient lan- 
guages, but he dare not take liberties in translating 
them, such as he takes in other language work. Is it 
not true that the English of a boy trained in the classics 
is in general better than that of a boy who has not had 
that training? Even if he should do no more Latin or 
Greek, or no more Latin alone, than is done in second- 
ary schools he will be apt to show the effect not only 
in his English but in his increased respect for beauty 
of expression in any form whatsoever. For that reason 
if for no other I should like to see all boys mentally 
capable, and all are not, given the privilege of some 
study in the classics.

Grorce C. St. JouHn 
Headmaster of The Choate School, Wallingford, Conn. 
To most of us the value of the classics does not re- 
quire argument; and to anybody who needs persuasion, 
Mr. Stearns’s article of last winter in the Atlantic would 
seem to me to be final. I almost think that arguing 
about the value of the classics is the same thing as argu- 
ing about the value of religion or of culture. 
Wim T. Berts 
Betts Tutoring School, Stamford, Conn, 
While headmaster of Betts Academy I used to say: 
“Other things being equal, give me the football man 
every time.” In developing boys for engineering courses, 
other things being equal, give me the one with a classical 
training back of him, every time. In engineering ca- 
reers, besides personality, is it not intellectual power 
that enables a man to rise to the top? You can not leave 
out the classics. 
In meeting college entrance requirements, Milton 
and Virgil are studied the same year. When a boy 
takes up Virgil he breaks away from the trammels of 
grammatical constructions, he sees the pictures as Vir- 
gil saw them, he describes them in English poetic prose, 
as Virgil describes them.in Latin hexameters. Then 
the student is able to comprehend Milton and the poets. 
Why the opposition to the classics? May it not arise 
from the catering on the part of the universities to the 
desire to get into life’s work in the shortest time on 
lines of least resistance? 
Shall we call history a cheat? Did not the world 
emerge from the Dark Ages through going back to the

study of the classics? Suppose it does take more time 
if classical studies are retained. What is a year or more 
taken out of the teens compared with intellectual power, 
with intellectual enjoyment, with intellectual finish in 
the decades that follow? 
Of the debts I owe to the memory of my father, not 
the least is that he sent me to college well grounded in 
Latin, Greek, French and German. 
ArtHur H. CuTLer 
Headmaster of The Cutler School, New York 
From long experience as a teacher and headmaster, 
I am convinced that the study of the classics not only 
helps to an appreciation of good literature and good 
reading but helps fully as much to accuracy and good 
style in the use of the English language. The writers 
of the future will be sadly handicapped if they have only 
modern languages and science and mathematics to help 
them. Of course, the elements of all these are neces- 
sary. The best mathematician I know reads two pages 
of Latin or Greek each day. 
Watter R. Marsa 
Headmaster of St. Paul’s School, Garden City, N. Y. 
The position of Saint Paul’s School in the matter of 
classical training is this: 
We believe absolutely that power is transferable. 
For example, we believe that an engineer should have 
a trained imagination, and we know of no better way to 
train his imagination than through the study of poetry. 
We believe thoroughly in classical training because of 
its disciplinary value. We believe that Latin has this 
disciplinary value because it is a highly inflected lan-

guage. If we could find another language equally in- 
flected we should be unwilling to substitute it for Latin 
because we see the value of Latin from a great many 
angles—historical, governmental, biographical, logical, 
and especially from the literary angle. 
We have sympathy with wise experimentation in edu- 
cation; we look with little sympathy and some amuse- 
ment on the propagandists now attempting destructive 
criticism of the solid foundations of centuries. We are. 
willing to learn, and yet, until we can discover some- 
thing better, we shall cling to the old, because we believe 
the old is worth while. 
James C. MACKENZIE 
Headmaster of the Mackenzie School, Monroe, N. Y. 
As I turn my mind back some forty-five years to the 
teaching of some five thousand American boys, I think 
I may safely say that the marked success of these stu- 
dents has been among those who have taken the solid 
classical course of study. While the record of the com- 
paratively few boys who have omitted Latin from their 
school and college course has been as a matter of course 
more satisfactory than it would have been without the 
training received along scientific lines, the record of the 
men who have taken Latin both in school and college 
has been, by and large, distinctly more notable than of 
the non-Latin men. The very best record has been made 
by those who have taken Greek. 
_ In offering this appreciation of classical studies, I 
am not limiting my consideration to men who have 
gone only into literary or professional life work. I 
have in mind men also who have attained prominence 
in statesmanship and in purely business careers.

When in England a few years ago I found many

“Why change our diet of roast beef, roast mutton, 
chops, bacon and a simple sweet, which for centuries 
has nourished the sturdiest people in Europe and has 
proved so digestible and nourishing that with slight 
modifications every hospital has adopted it as diet for 
invalids and convalescents?” 
Is not that about all there is of the question? 
The heads of high schools and preparatory schools 
have the key to the situation. Let them discourage 
weak boys and girls from attempting the most difficult 
of languages—the Latin—and mildly insist that strong

derived from the study of the grammar of the classics 
and from translation into our own vernacular. I am

I favor the classics, especially Latin, as an essential 
element in the best type of liberal education (but not, 
of course, to the exclusion of the history, literature and 
life of other peoples and periods), because it is the 
fountain from which much of our later civilization has 
flowed. My experience in schools and colleges has con- 
firmed these views because I have witnessed the effects 
of classical culture in many students. 
JoHN C. SHARPE

I am fully convinced from observation extending over 
a long service as a schoolmaster, and the statistics of 
my own school, that the best students in the classes are 
almost invariably the students who take the full four 
years course in Latin. Perhaps your convention will 
be able to determine whether the ablest boys take Latin 
or whether the study of Latin develops the ablest boys. 
In my judgment, the boy of ability much below the 
average had better not undertake a four years course 
in Latin for he will hardly be able to realize the ad- 
vantages that come from the long sustained effort.

same amount of study spent on four different subjects. 
No subject in our curriculum is so well adapted to this 
end as Latin.

For some twenty years I taught both history and 
political economy in the University of Pennsylvania to™ 
students in both the classical and the scientific courses. 
I had both classes of students come to me for history in 
their freshman year, and both again for political econ- 
omy in their senior year. I could see no marked differ- 
ence between them as freshmen, but as seniors they dif- 
fered very widely. The students who had been pursuing 
the “humanities” in the intervening years had come up 
to something like the level of their teachers, and took 
up questions with a firm and intelligent grasp. But 
those who had been occupied chiefly with scientific 
studies, although interested in my work, had nothing 
like the ability the others showed in dealing with a 
form of work and a set of problems equally new to 
both. At that time I was not prejudiced in favor of 
either kind of education. I was the Secretary of the 
Faculty of Science from its beginning and for a good 
part of those twenty years, and therefore to some de- 
gree enlisted on the scientific side of things. But year

soon as they could. The first class almost always carry

Latin should be studied because it is a hard subject 
for most boys and girls. It requires clear thinking and 
concentration and that systematic continuous discipli- 
nary study which is essential for any real education. At 
the present time there is danger that the short cuts in 
education will severely handicap the future of our boys 
and girls. The cry is for subjects that have an imme- 
diate dollar and cents value. Parents are apt to over- 
look the fact that such studies, instead of being truly 
liberal in the sense of opening many doors and oppor- 
tunities for their boys and girls, are in reality narrowing. 
They circumscribe the opportunities and while open- 
ing one or two doors effectively close other doors.

Man is distinguished from animals, as Sallust tells 
us, in possessing an intellect as well as a body; and that 
education which regards only the physical man and 
trains the hands alone, so that it perfects the human 
machine alone, neglects the man’s nobler side. The 
ever increasing demand for “hewers of wood and draw- 
ers of water” does not mean that these must be merely 
machines; what “Plato thought and godlike Cato was” 
is as valuable to such as these as to any other class even 
in simply giving them a spiritual uplift and outlook to 
make them happy at their appointed task. The classi- 
cal training has never unfitted men for vocational work, 
while vocational training has made many a one unfit 
for better service to society. It is the spirit of true 
democracy to broaden opportunity to rise to the height 
of one’s power. It is false democracy to insist that all 
must be content with the lowest form of social service.

The following are the reasons why we require Latin: 
Half of English comes from Latin, directly or 
through French. As a basis for an exact knowledge of 
English familiarity with Latin is invaluable. 
A lkmowledge of the lives and acts of leaders both 
among men and among nations is a basis for decisions 
for matters of today. For example, Caesar’s military 
campaigns were largely on the same ground and on the 
same plan as are those in Europe today. 
Latin is a very logical language, and requires reflec- 
tive thinking for translation and composition. The 
mastery of Latin requires effort and concentration; and 
anything which does that today is performing its service 
in education. 
While Latin is not a living language, it can be and 
must be connected with life of today. A more serious 
effort in that direction on the part of teachers of Latin, 
to my mind, would be repaid a hundredfold in increased 
interest in the study of the language and in getting its 
admitted value.

Apart from the absurdity of a man trying to deal in

that we want to make men all specialists in these lan-

which enables one to get the good out of the work of

highest education the languages and literatures and his-

that nothing can take their place.

Bengamin B. WarFieLD

I am a teacher of Christian theology, and as the prin- 
cipal source book of Christian theology is a Greek book, 
and a large part of its literature is written in Latin, I 
am predisposed to desire that Greek and Latin should 
have a large place in academic training. I fully recog- 
nize, however, that the training given in our academic 
institutions should not be determined by the needs of 
any one profession. Its primary object, in my view, in 
fact is not so much to impart knowledge as to form 
mind; and it is because I have a clear and, as I believe, 
well founded conviction that a sound classical training 
provides the best means at our disposal for a sound 
mental discipline that I am an earnest advocate of it. 
Were we for any reason debarred from the use of the 
classics, I have little question that much the same train- 
ing which we now obtain from them could be obtained 
without them. But neither do I have much doubt that 
the same training could not be obtained without them 
without a larger expenditure of both labor and effort. 
So long as we have the choice in a free field the classical 
course, in my judgment, should be chosen as supplying 
the best means as yet known of general mental disci- 
pline. What I chiefly value in it is the quality of mind 
which it produces. As Oliver Wendell Holmes would 
express it, it seems permanently “to stretch the pia

Roscoz— Pounp 
Dean of the Law School, Harvard University 
I have taught law in four different law schools and, 
with some care and much interest, have looked into the 
pre-legal education of students in each of the schools 
wherein I have taught. What I have learned in this 
way has produced a strong impression that students 
who come to the law school with a good linguistic train- 
ing, especially those who have had good training in the 
classics, other things being equal, have an advantage 
and do better work from the beginning. (The law de- 
mands a clearness and accuracy in thinking which is 
only to be attained in connection with accuracy in the 
use and in the interpretation of language. While 
courses in economics, sociology, politics and related sub- 
jects undoubtedly have great value for the student of 
law, those who come solely or chiefly with this prepara- 
tion do not show to advantage as a rule in comparison 
with those who have been trained to examine a written 
text critically and to express themselves clearly and ac- 
curately in a strange tongue. Consequently, when a 
committee of the Association of American Law Schools 
was called upon some years ago to recommend a stan- 
dard course for those preparing for law, while the de- 
sirability of courses in history, economics and social and 
political science was recognized, there was a general 
agreement on the part of the members of the committee 
in the wish that law students might all be trained first 
in languages, especially the classical languages, and 
mathematics, with as much of the subjects more di- 
rectly related to law as could be filled in.

My dear Professor Cowles: 
Many thanks for your letter, to which I am very glad 
to reply. 
What I said the other night about the classics was a 
digression, made ew tempore, and I have no notes of it. 
It was an expression of the following views, which are 
the result of practical experience. 
Apart from the special and obvious need of studying 
Latin in preparing for the law, in order to understand 
the early law Latin and the Latin phrases and maxims 
which constantly recur in the law books, the study of the 
classics seems to me particularly adapted to develop 
qualities which are very necessary to the practicing 
lawyer. ‘The business of analysis and mental detective 
work is a large part of a lawyer’s activity. In the un- 
ravelling of complicated combinations of fact and in 
solving problems darkened by falsehood and errors of 
memory he is continually making, verifying and dis- 
carding a series of working hypotheses. I have often 
observed that the mental processes involved in such work 
are substantially identical with those called into play 
by the task of translating at sight a page of Latin or 
Greek. 
Even more important, perhaps, is the relation of such 
study to the neat and exact use of language. It is of  
-P-A-G-E-236
  228 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
course the lawyer’s special duty not only to reason 
soundly but to express his ideas with clearness and ac- 
curacy. It is vital, therefore, that he should know how 
to select the very word which will fit his thought. I do 
not see how a student could better train himself in this 
choice of words than by translating Latin into English 
and English into Latin. 
As I said to the young men the other night, I gave 
myself largely to the classics during the first two years 
of my college course, but abandoned them at the end of 
my sophomore year for political economy and history. 
I did this because I thought it would fit me better for 
the law. Much as I enjoyed and profited by the courses 
which I took in my junior and senior years, I believe 
that if I were making the choice over again I should not 
give up the classics.

No one gets the best out of a liberal education whom 
it has not helped to express himself clearly in written 
words. The faculty of doing this is native to some men. 
To the less fortunate I believe that nothing can give 
more aid in acquiring it than practice in turning the 
terms and texture of a Greek or Latin passage into 
those of their own language, or a passage expressed in 
that into Greek or Latin. 
I made it a practice for thirty years to read a few 
lines of Greek daily, discontinuing it only when I found 
that it was beginning to strain my eyes. In my profes- 
sion, that of law, some knowledge of Latin is indispens-

able, and sufficient knowledge of it to make reading the 
Corpus Juris Civilis an easy task is a very desirable 
acquisition. No man can be called an accomplished 
lawyer who has not some acquaintance with comparative 
law and cannot compare the jurisprudence of his State 
or country not only with that of other states or coun- 
tries of his own time, but with that of ancient Kuropean 
governments. The Roman law is the source of much 
more than was once thought of in modern American 
law. It is well worth studying at its fountain head. 
Nor can the history or literature of any peoples be 
ever really understood by one wholly ignorant of their 
language. He has to take too much on trust. The 
great works of Greece and Rome introduce us into a 
new world, and set up standards of comparison that are 
not seldom of more worth to a philosophic student than 
those accepted in modern nations, since they explain 
why these have their present form.

I am of opinion that no study of the classics is of any 
practical value to the average man of business. In fact, 
all education beyond a high school education is, in so 
far as the practical results are concerned, time wasted. 
Narrowness is frequently an important element in 
pecuniary success. A selfish and narrow view is the 
common trait of the successful business man. 
For the professional man who is highly ambitious of 
professional success, a study of the classics has no little 
practical value. In that I am familiar with no method 
by which the control and mastery of the English lan-
-P-A-G-E-238

guage can be acquired equal to that of the prolonged 
study of both Latin and Greek. ' 
The minute you inquire as to the practical value of a 
liberal education or any of its constituents, you in a 
measure debase the cause of education. Nothing in my 
judgment is more demoralizing than to put constantly 
before the ingenuous youth of the nation the question 
whether or not the study of this, that or the other sub- 
ject will enable them the better to earn a living or to 
make money. You might just as well discuss with them 
whether it pays to be patriotic, self sacrificing and 
heroic. Generally speaking I think these qualities are 
far less likely to contribute to their pecuniary success 
than many that are more sordid and less admirable. 
Therefore, I regard it as highly desirable that young 
men should study things which are of no practical value 
to them if they seek and are worthy of a liberal educa- 
tion. 
There are, so far as I know, no studies which in after 
life afford educated and cultivated men so much plea- 
sure as the study of the ancient classics. Forsan et 
haec olim meminisse juvabit. I quote from memory and 
possibly my memory is inaccurate, as I knew small 
Latin and less Greek. To read Homer, Virgil, Cicero, 
Horace, Tacitus and the Greek tragedies in the original 
is in itself, in my judgment, an indispensable part of a 
liberal education. I do not speak of mental discipline, 
for I have always thought it a false notion that it was a 
part of a college education to discipline the mind by a 
sort of mental gymnastics. Rather does it open and 
expand the mind to great variety of different topics and 
thus open the avenues of information and enable a man 
to find a place in orderly arrangement for that which

he acquires through life. The education which he gets 
within college walls is not alone sufficient to make him 
a broad minded, high minded, intelligent and cultivated 
man. There he is at the gateway. All that he gets of 
mental training and discipline is undoubtedly valuable, 
but the broadening of his mental vision and spiritual 
inspiration which he should receive from his instructors 
—now, alas, almost entirely wanting—are far more 
important.

I believe there is no satisfactory substitute for classi-

The training which such studies give in precision and 
elegance in the use of language and in the accurate de- 
limitation of similar ideas or concepts the one from the

equalled by studies of any other kind. With reference 
to my own special field, legal education, I am convinced, 
as I think are the majority of my colleagues, that the 
study of the classical languages, Greek and Latin, is of 
the greatest value. The mental processes of the stu- 
dent who is translating from one language to another 
are similar to those of the lawyer engaged in interpret- 
ing a Supreme Court opinion or a statute; and by reason 
of their logical and complete organization and structure 
Latin and Greek are much better for this purpose than 
any other language. There is of course the additional 
advantage to the law student who has studied Latin that 
he has thereby become familiar with a great many words 
which have become part of the terminology of the Eng- 
lish common law. If I could have my way, I would re- 
quire all prospective law students to study both Latin 
and Greek.

On the question concerning the value of the classics 
in liberal education I can have no doubt, if they should 
be studied in the same way in which many of us have 
learned to read French or German, without much bother 
over the rules of grammar as rules to be learned but 
with an effort to associate the words with the things 
they signify and to practice translation as soon and as 
much as may be. Latin is of considerable practical im- 
portance in itself and also as the foundation of so many 
modern languages, and of so many words in languages 
not founded upon it. Greek is less important in itself, 
but opens the door to pleasures not to be had without it, 
as no poet, at least, can be appreciated except in his 
own words. It seems to me that people who think they 
are enjoying Euripides, for instance, in the charming 
translations that we know, probably are getting their 
pleasure from a modern atmosphere that is precisely 
what is not in the original. And further, when one con- 
siders the relation of modern literatures to those of 
Greece and Rome, it seems obvious that they cannot be 
fully felt without some acquaintance with their ances- 
tors. I think the trouble has been (I cannot speak about 
the present) that the energy of pupils has been ex- 
hausted upon rules rather than upon content. A super- 
ficial knowledge of structure is enough for the purpose 
for which it is desirable to teach Latin and Greek to the 
run of boys.

My view of the practical value of Latin in the profes-

expression. The lawyer and judge must read, interpret 
and define with certainty. The greatest jurists have 
been men whose ability and reasoning powers have been 
highly developed and who have had the power of ac- 
curate, concise statement. A course in Latin, aside 
from the mental discipline it gives, is unquestionably a 
means to this end. A detail is the fact that the language 
of the law is largely of Latin derivation. Exceptional 
men have excelled without a knowledge of any lan- 
guage except their own, but the vast majority need such 
study to develop what I may call the language sense.

It is now some fifty years since I graduated from 
college after giving a considerable number of years to 
classical study, and I can say that I have never re- 
gretted what I learned by that study. 
Greek and Latin seem to me of great value in two 
ways. In the first place they enable a man who is called 
upon to speak and write to use his words with precision 
and to make his meaning clear by using the right word 
in the right place. The knowledge of classics also en- 
ables a man to understand what others say, to appre- 
ciate the exact shade of meaning which the writer seeks 
to convey and to understand readily much which to 
one who is not familiar with those languages is difficult 
of comprehension. 
In the next place our views on contemporary ques- 
tions are inevitably affected by our own prejudices, in- 
terests and associations, but the study of the classics 
carries us into an atmosphere so far removed from our 
own that we can appreciate the lessons of history, learn 
to weigh the motives which control a man’s action, and 
from the experience of other men in remote times learn 
to recognize the dangers which beset our own path.

In my opinion the study of both Latin and Greek is 
indispensable to a liberal education; and I mean such 
study as will ensure considerable facility not only in 
reading ordinary Greek and Latin authors but in writ- 
ing Latin and Greek prose. 
The first result is to ensure greater clearness and 
compactness in writing English. 
Second, the classical authors cannot be fu ally enjoyed 
and appreciated except when studied in the original. 
Third, a large part of modern literature, from the 
time of the Renaissance, is unintelligible without a 
knowledge of the classics.

The test of the trained mind is to be found in its re- 
sponse to a call for its expression in language. And, 
excepting in the cases of rare occurrence like those of 
Abraham Lincoln, the ability to express one’s mind in 
proper language can be developed best, and generally 
only, by the patient and persistent study of the classics. 
This consideration alone, apart from the recognition of 
the culture value of studies in classic art and archaeol- 
ogy, commands my complete support of classical studies, 
even for the man desirous of success in practical affairs.

I believe it can be shown: 
That classical studies teach precision of expression, 
and the relation of words in sentences; that they lead 
toward accurate thought and that they have been on the 
whole the best teachers of English style. 
That if a knowledge of modern languages brings cul- 
ture we should expect to find the highest exponents of 
that culture in restaurant waiters. I believe in the cul- 
ture which comes from a knowledge of events sufficient- 
ly intimate to lead a man to place his own interpretation 
upon history. Classical studies do in fact promote this 
knowledge of the Greek democracies and of the times of 
Caesar in Rome, and they furnish a background for an 
understanding of the time of Cromwell in England and 
the present in America. So far as I know this work has 
never been so well accomplished as it has been through 
classical studies. 
That disinterested public service is not taught by any 
educational system directed solely to utilitarian ends. 
Most persons must devote their energies to earning 
money, but we can teach everybody that civilization 
rests upon moral forces, that learning has intrinsic value 
and that though learning is a luxury for the individual 
it is a necessity for the state.

what studies had especially contributed to my fitness 
for my work, such as it is; and I have always fixed on
-P-A-G-E-247
  STATEMENTS 289 
two, one of which—and perhaps the more important—is 
the study of the Greek and Latin languages. A large 
part of a lawyer’s work has to do with the use of lan- 
guage. That it is a most important part will be real- 
ized upon a moment’s reflection in regard to wills, con- 
tracts and statutes, from the standpoint of him who 
draws such instruments and from that of him who reads 
them and has to determine their meaning; and also in 
regard to writing opinions from the bench or otherwise, 
and determining the meaning of opinions written by 
others. Take down at random a volume of reports and 
you will probably find that a majority of the cases turn 
upon questions merely as to the meaning of written 
words. Ability to use words so as to convey a given 
meaning clearly and to see clearly the meaning of the 
words written by others is, I believe, more important to 
the lawyer than ability in any other line. And perhaps 
I might add that it is more unusual. And yet, so far 
as I know, scarcely any attention is paid to it in any 
scheme of law school education. Whatever of such abil- 
ity I have is due, so far as I can see, chiefly to the study 
of Greek and Latin, the analytical study of words and 
sentences in these languages and the work of translating 
from them into English or putting English into these 
languages. Need I elaborate to convey my thought? 
In this study I got the chief part of my knowledge of 
language, the chief part of my equipment—supple- 
mented, of course, by practice since—for the large and 
important part of a lawyer’s work to which I have re- 
ferred.

been engaged in trying patent and similar cases, my

of Greek and Latin, affords better preparation for suc-

Lawrence E. SEXTON

Of course I believe in the study of Latin and Greek, 
in the study of the structure as well as the literature of 
those languages, and in the histories of those two great 
peoples who developed them. I feel, too, that no one 
can be a well educated man, in the best sense, who 
lacks that training, however proficient he may be in 
other learning. That a training in the classics adds to 
one’s efficiency, whatever may be his profession or vo- 
cation in life, I do not doubt. And not the least of the 
advantages thereof is the pleasure, the intellectual 
pleasure, it opens up to him whose fortune it has been 
to possess it.

slaughter of millions of our fellow beings, the wanton 
destruction of historical monuments, the tearing down

terrorizing humanity; at a time when we too have been 
drawn into the great conflict in defence and furtherance 
of those great principles of liberty and humanity which 
are more precious than life itself, it is heartening to find 
that there are still those, few perhaps in numbers but 
steadfast of purpose, who appreciate the necessity, for 
the sake of those who will come after them, of keeping 
lighted the lamps of that higher scholarship and more 
enlightened vision which have illumined the world for 
so many centuries and which must not be permitted to 
die out.

I consider myself fortunate in having begun the study 
of Latin when but ten years old, for not only has the 
vocabulary remained far more firmly fixed than it would 
had I taken it up some years later as do most American 
boys, but the grammar also came to me as naturally as 
English grammar. Latin is to me a living language to 
use, not merely for the purpose of translating into Eng- 
lish. As a result it became comparatively easy to read 
and understand such Romance languages as Spanish, 
Italian, Catalan and Portuguese before I had even com- 
menced to study them carefully. 
The Latin prosody gave a far quicker and surer ear 
for both quantity and accent which has been of great 
value to me in modern languages. Classical history and 
mythology have enabled me to appreciate the almost 
innumerable allusions scattered throughout literature 
and have greatly increased the enjoyment of mediaeval 
and modern writers. 
In the law, my own profession, I have found Latin of
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
great importance not only since so much of the termin- 
ology is Latin, but also because the structure of much 
of our law, especially equity jurisprudence, is based on 
it. As a reader of mediaeval history, I should have 
been stopped at the beginning of my inquiries had I not 
been able to read classic and later Latin. 
I regret that I did not take up Greek until some years 
after beginning Latin and that I unfortunately found 
it advisable to give it up at the end of sophomore year, 
for in consequence it has never been to me the living 
language that Latin is, nor have I retained so full a 
vocabulary. While I can usually understand the mean- 
ing of the host of scientific terms derived from the 
Greek, yet sometimes I find myself at a loss. I can, 
therefore, to some extent appreciate the immense diffi- 
culty under which any man ignorant of the classics 
necessarily labors in trying to assimilate the enormous 
number of Greek words lately incorporated into Eng- 
lish, which must appear meaningless to him and have to 
be learned by rote. 
As a university trustee for the past thirty years I 
have grown more and more convinced of the great im- 
portance of the proper study of the classics. I believe 
also that they should be begun at an earlier age than is 
usual in America and should be taught from English 
into Latin, rather than Latin into English. The Eng- 
lish public schools with their Greek and Latin verse 
making have been a potent force in training boys to 
write fairly good Latin and Greek, and even more, to 
write pure, virile and melodious English. 
In fine I have found the classics, and especially Latin, 
by far the most valuable of my studies; and, were I to 
repeat my undergraduate days, I should devote quite 
as much time to Latin and much more to Greek.

Men are educated when they are able to use their 
mental faculties with facility and accuracy upon any 
given subject that is presented to them. Perhaps this is 
the greatest advantage of the study of Greek and Latin, 
and no exercise has been found more admirably adapted 
for the purpose. 
Cuartes Epwin Fox 
Philadelphia 
The study of Latin, if well done, carries with it a 
mental disciplining that is no less real than that to be 
derived from the study of mathematics. Herein lies its 
chief advantage to the student of law. He comes from 
his high school or college course to his work upon the 
text books and case books of law with an ability to con- 
centrate and coordinate that largely had its origin while
-P-A-G-E-252

he was developing for himself the problems of Latin 
syntax and translation. 
But the student, having come to be the practitioner, 
still continues to derive an advantage from his know]- 
edge of Latin that is quite as valuable, even though not 
so direct, as the one just indicated. It has served to 
teach him the significance of language, particularly of 
grammar. There is a certain rigidity and accuracy to 
Latin; idioms are fewer and well marked. Precise ad- 
herence to its well established rules of syntax produces 
precise results in speech. It is obvious that the practice 
of law, in large measure, requires a proper appreciation 
of the correct relation of words and phrases. One’s ex- 
perience with Latin may guide him to a better discrimi- 
nation in his English phrasing, which to a lawyer is in- 
valuable.

liberal ideas in every way. The club was formed in the 
early ’70s, and it exists to this day. At first we con-

other phases of Latin literature: Cicero’s letters, Pliny’s 
letters, Catullus, Petronius Arbiter, Terence, Tibullus,

In view of the slovenly English in which most of the

that lawyers and judges shall be well versed in the 
classics. 
H. E. Spa.pine

When I was graduated from the University of Michi- 
gan thirty-five years ago I was able to read Greek and 
Latin at sight fairly well and I have continued the read- 
ing of both ever since for my own pleasure. My busi- 
ness has been the practice of law. I have no qualifica- 
tion to judge of the value of classical studies except 
such as these facts imply. 
Aside from disciplinary value and that of an acquaint- 
ance with two literatures which so largely enter into 
the fabric of all modern literature, the principal direct 
benefit of classical study, as it seems to me, is found in 
the training which that study if properly conducted 
gives in the high and difficult art of clear and accurate 
expression of thought. I speak advisedly when I say 
that few can state any matter, other than the simplest, 
in clear, accurate and concise language, and that the 
lack of this ability accounts for a very large proportion 
of litigation as well as of other human misunderstand- 
ings. In my judgment translation, especially transla- 
tion at sight, without which no one can escape the slavery
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
of the dictionary, is far superior to driginal composition 
as an instrument for the development of this ability. I 
may say at the same time, for the sake of emphasis, 
something often said before, that classical teachers in 
schools and colleges have been and as I think still are 
not sufficiently mindful of the importance of this mat- 
ter. The proper practice of translation materially con- 
tributes to the formation of a good English style. Slip- 
shod translation, such as was common when I was in 
college, and which I incline to think is still not uncom- . 
mon, materially interferes with the development of the 
ability to perceive differences in meanings and to un- 
derstand the force and effect of different forms of ex- 
pression. Students ordinarily enter college with the 
most rudimentary ideas of expression. They can 
neither speak nor write clearly and accurately. Classi- 
cal studies should correct these faults. As those studies 
were commonly prosecuted a generation ago they tended 
to confirm students in habits of slovenly and inaccurate 
expression and necessarily in corresponding faults of 
thought. 
It is difficult for one to analyze or to state fairly the 
result of impressions derived from his own experience. 
A lawyer has to deal with a great variety of affairs and, 
therefore, to inform himself in many branches of special 
knowledge. His study is rarely exhaustive, but he 
should be able readily to acquire and assimilate numer- 
ous and complicated facts, to discriminate their values, 
grasp their relations, discard the irrelevant and insigni- 
ficant and present the result in proper order and in 
clear and adequate form. This is the ideal, imperfectly 
realized by any. But I am convinced that any one with 
reasonable natural aptitude for languages will find clas-   
-P-A-G-E-255
STATEMENTS 247 
sical study the best preparation for the study and prac- 
tice of the law. 
I have dwelt on material considerations only. But I 
hardly need to say what all who have caught any of the 
spirit of classical literature know well, that the greatest 
value of the classics is in their power to instruct, inspire 
and console us in all that part of life that is beyond and 
above the business of existence. 
Joun M. Zane

The study of the classics I regard as of more im- 
portance at the present day than at any other. There 
never was a time when every man, engineer, doctor, 
lawyer, business man, so greatly required the classical 
training as today. All affairs are now, more than ever 
before, a matter of words—either spoken or written 
words. And for dealing with words only the classical 
training, the old fashioned drill in Latin and Greek, 
can give a man the requisite discipline. Having said 
this, I pass by the important consideration that the 
world of thought is part and parcel of the classics, and 
come purely to their practical, bread and butter advan- 
tage. Almost every legal record today is merely a trans- 
lation of a Latin document. Reading of Latin keeps 
the attention close, keeps one weighing words, keeps one 
extracting all the meaning there is in words, keeps 
one coordinating words to get their fullest effect.

. . « But so much for the history of the evolution of
-P-A-G-E-256
    248 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
the Latin language as the monument on which our legal 
maxims and axioms, as well as much of our legal his- 
tory, are engraved. We might have gone so far as to 
have disregarded the explanation of the existence of 
Latin in our legal texts and accept the plain fact that it 
is there. But its presence is the result of the same con- 
siderations and necessities that have preserved it 
through so many adversities down to the present time. 
So then, the advantages of a training in Latin might 
be said to be those that attend the study of history, as 
well as of etymology, and so the student of law encoun- 
ters on every hand phrases and principles carved in 
Latin and transmitted to him and his age in their origi- 
nal vigor and shades of meaning. Many, he finds, have 
become so familiar that he adopts them as “naturalized.” 
Actions of assumpsit, quo warranto, and upon a quan- 
tum meruit or quantwm valebat, writs of capias and sub- 
poena, pleadings of nol. pros. and pro confesso, are so 
familiar that he often loses sight of their original signifi- 
cance. Yet the student must draw upon his knowledge 
of the Latin to assure himself that he knows the distinc- 
tion between a summons and a subpoena, a capias, 
a warrant and a mittimus, between a habeas corpus ad 
testificandum and a habeas corpus ad satisfaciendum, 
between scire facias, venire facias and fiert facias, and 
administrators de bonis non, cwm testamento annexo, 
and de son tort. Is the layman correct when he speaks 
of “subordination” of perjury? To the Latin students 
the value and importance of obiter dicta in applying the 
doctrine of stare decisis are amply explained within the 
phrases themselves. 
It may be that the student learns his Latin in the 
study of law. If this fact does not demand that he come
-P-A-G-E-257
      STATEMENTS 249 
thus already prepared to the study of law, it at least 
suggests the advantage of doing so. As suggested, if 
the student is not prepared in Latin he must to some 
extent become acquainted with its expressions, regard- 
less of his views as to its necessity. If the use of Latin 
terminology, for example, is cumbersome for the botan- 
ist or the pharmacist, the best answer is that its presence 
in those sciences is undeniable.

There has been found nowhere a better training for 
the thinking apparatus of the young than the study of 
Latin and Greek. Carelessness and superficiality are 
incompatible with any thorough study of Greek and 
Latin. The student’s observation is sharpened, his per- 
ception becomes more delicate and he finds increased 
pleasure in the intensity with which he seeks fully and 
correctly to interpret the author’s meaning. And this 
habit of close observation, of attention to detail, of look- 
ing for fine distinctions and shades of difference, and the 
alertness of mind possessed by an individual of this habit 
will be of inestimable service to him, should he choose 
medicine for his profession, both in his experimental

foundation in his education, not only for his service as

places the student more closely in touch with classical 
thought than anything derived from knowledge ob- 
tained through translation alone.

When in the period of so-called secondary education 
it is proposed to substitute the study of the natural 
sciences for a good training in the humanities, there is 
danger of drying up some of the sources from which this 
             
-P-A-G-E-259
wr 
STATEMENTS 251 
very scientific expansion has sprung, and it seems to me 
by no means impossible. The study of the classics, 
an acquaintance with the thoughts and the philoso- 
phies of past ages, gives to the student a certain breadth 
of conception, a stability of mind which is difficult to 
obtain in another way. A familiarity with Greek and 
Latin literature is an accomplishment which means 
-tauch to the man who would devote himself to any 
branch of art or science or history. One may search 
long among the truly great names in medicine for one 
whose training has been devoid of this vital link be- 
tween the far reaching radicles of the past and what we 
are pleased to regard as the flowering branches of to- 
day. Greek and Latin are far from dead languages to 
the Continental student. They are dead to us because 
they are taught us as dead. With methods of teaching 
in our secondary schools equal to those prevailing in 
England and on the Continent, ’twould be an easy mat- 
ter, in a materially shorter period, to give our boys an 
infinitely broader education than they now receive. 
There should be much less complaint of time wasted, 
much less ground for suggesting the abandonment of 
the study of branches which are invaluable to any schol- 
arly minded man. 
But there is yet another side of the question which 
has hardly been sufficiently emphasized, a side of the 
question which must come strongly to one’s mind when 
he considers the general education of many of the men 
who are entering even our better schools of medicine, 
a point of view which has been especially insisted upon 
by a recent French observer. A large part of the suc- 
cess and usefulness of the practitioner of medicine de- 
pends upon the influence which he exerts upon his pa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
tients; upon the confidence which he infuses; upon his 
power to explain, to persuade, to inspire. It can scarce- 
ly be denied that these powers are more easily wielded 
by the man of general culture and education than by 
one of uncouth manner and untrained speech, however 
brilliant may be his accomplishments in the field of 
exact science. I can do no better than quote the words 
of Professor Lemoine (Congrés Francaise de médecine. 
VI Session. Paris, 1902 8°, T. II., p. xli.): 
“Indeed the moral influence which he [the physician] 
is capable of exercising upon the patient and which he 
exercises to an ever increasing degree with his intel- 
lectual superiority, is one of the most important of 
therapeutic agents. One heals by words at least as 
much as by drugs, but one must know how to say these 
words and to exercise a sufficient moral authority, that 
they may bring conviction to the patient and carry the 
full weight of suggestion which is intended. Were it 
but for this reason I shall range myself among those 
who demand the maintenance of extensive classical 
studies as a preparation for those of medicine, for the 
best means to uphold the prestige of the physician is 
still to raise him as far as possible above his contempo- 
raries.” 
These words express, it seems to me, a large measure 
of truth. May it not be that in the tendency to the ne- 
glect of the humanities we are taking a false step? May 
it not be that if on the other hand we teach them earlier 
and better we shall find in the end that no essential time 
is lost, while we shall gain for medicine men not only 
with minds abler to grasp the larger and broader prob- 
lems, but with materially fuller powers for carrying on 
the humbler but no less important duties of the practi- 
tioner of medicine?

As far as my experience goes with students entering 
the medical school it seems clear that the freedom of 
election which has been permitted them in the high 
school and in college has been a serious disadvantage to 
their preparation for medicine. Entirely too large a 
proportion of these students have had an insufficient 
amount of Latin. Their work here and in English has 
too often been superficial. In mathematics very few 
have secured a satisfactory working knowledge. 
The average man lacks a systematic method of 
thought, and exhibits no near approach to the mathe- 
matical precision required in science, and more needed 
every day in ordinary life. A number of courses in 
school will teach observation, memorizing or descrip- 
tion, as geography, history or literature; but in biology, 
anatomy or physiology it is necessary in addition to be 
able to draw accurate, safe conclusions from collected 
data. The constructive process in an introduction re- 
quires training in mathematical reasoning. This is not 
realized by most persons unfamiliar with the modern 
demands of science and the subjects which are depend- 
ent on her results. 
If medical sciences are to be taught as anything more 
than mere memory work, we must insist on our stu- 
dents being previously trained in mathematics, and 
much more rigidly trained than they now seem to be. 
Their method of thought is now apt to be diffuse, un- 
systematic and inconclusive; apparently because of the 
loose way in which they have been hurried through a 
minimum of both Latin and mathematics. These sub-
-P-A-G-E-262

pline, besides forming a necessary part of our funda-

passed better examinations and later made better in-

those who had no college training. This conclusion was, 
I think, shared with me by the other members of the 
examining committee. 
In my experience through life in dealing with medi- 
cal men during the last thirty years, I can say with 
confidence that the men who have been educated in col- 
leges and received the A.B. degree have been much the 
most intelligent and satisfactory and successful. Of 
course this is only the personal experience of one who 
may have some bias in the matter.

some investigations of a literary and scientific character, 
and spent my days in the library of St. Mark. I there 
became tremendously impressed with the fact all the 
learning and activities of Europe from the period of the 
Middle Ages to the beginning of the nineteenth century 
was practically in Latin; and there was an immense 
volume of literature practically inaccessible except to 
those who are familiar with that tongue. 
Almost every one who is working hard in the pursuit 
of business or profession needs some indoor recreation. 
Some take it in cards, in billiards, in various forms of 
social intercourse, etc. I have found that the puzzling 
out of Latin, especially Latin poetry, was more amus- 
ing than card playing or the study of the problems of 
chess or of backgammon, ete. In other words, reading 
Latin, and the same would be true probably of Greek, 
furnishes a sort of perpetual resource to those who are 
interested in working out the intricacies of a rather diffi- 
cult tongue and who desire to get reward by the final 
feeling of appreciation of a beautiful piece of literature. 
From the point of view of psychology and education 
I know absolutely, as much as one can know absolutely, 
that learning Latin is an excellent method of training 
and developing the mental faculties, involving attention 
with reward, memory, judgment and knowledge of the 
structure of language. 
ALEXANDER DUANE

I am very strongly of the opinion that a thorough 
course of Latin and Greek furnishes the best prepara- 
tion not only for the so-called learned professions, law, 
medicine and theology, but also for scientific and tech-
-P-A-G-E-265
  
STATEMENTS 257 
nical pursuits and for business. Such study furnishes 
an effectual remedy against the narrowness of view and 
the limitation of ideas that an exclusively technical and 
vocational training begets; and by drilling and sharpen- 
ing the mental faculties it enables the student to acquire 
much more readily than would otherwise be possible the 
knowledge that his calling, whatever it may be, de- 
mands. Furthermore, because of the grasp of general 
principles and the habit of logical thinking that it im- 
parts, it makes him an abler and more useful man. It 
thus better fits him not only for his special business but 
also for the more general concerns of life. And it does 
so better than any other educational scheme yet devised. 
Comparative tests, extending now over many years, 
have proved this quite conclusively. 
Personally, then, I feel that in the training of the 
medical man some things usually thought unnecessary 
should be included as of major importance. I think the 
physician should have no less than fifty months of actual 
work in Latin, and should have read Cicero, Virgil and 
Horace. I believe that every physician should have 
devoted at least thirty-six months of actual work to 
Greek, and should have read Homer, the dramatists and 
Plato in the original. The Greeks were by far the most 
artistic and the most intellectual people the world has 
ever seen; their literature represented the highest de- 
velopment of ancient thought, and their language was a 
marvellously delicate and powerful instrument for the 
expression of that thought. The study of that language 
and of the literature in the original, bringing us into 
intimate contact with the Greek mind, fulfills better 
than anything that has yet been devised the prime ob- 
jects of education—information, mental culture, men-
-P-A-G-E-266
  258 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
tal discipline and the promotion of high ideals. There 
is, indeed, no greater training for the mind than is 
furnished by the study of the Greek language and the 
translation of Greek originals; and, the Bible and 
Shakespeare apart, there is no more potent means of 
mental culture and spiritual uplift than is furnished by 
Greek literature. The influence of Athens is as vital 
today as it was when Macaulay paid his glowing tribute. 
No educated man, least of all medical men, should ever 
lose personal touch with the classics. 
For my own part I think it is of more importance for 
me as a physician to have read Euripides than to know 
the technique of the Wassermann reaction. I believe 
that it is of greater value to me professionally to have 
studied Greek than to know German. This opinion, old 
fashioned and indeed obsolete as it may seem, is based 
on somewhat extended observation of different educa- 
tional systems for a good many years, during which I 
have seen the rise and fall of several fads and have ac- 
quired a realizing sense of what one most practical man 
meant when he said: “Prove [test] all things; hold 
fast to that which is good.” I hold fast to Greek.

that, it has carried me far afield of engineering and given

This is written by one who is not a classical scholar. 
In my college courses I studied German and French. 
My classical training consists of a short course in the 
high school; translating since leaving school, for my 
own pleasure, Caesar and Cicero; and the reading of 
translations of the classics. My knowledge of Greek is 
much less. I have therefore only a limited field of clas-

been almost daily of practical value to me.

students often take. 
Rosert H. Frernatp

There is no question that a knowledge of Latin and 
Greek is of appreciable value from the broadest educa- 
tional standpoint. Besides a knowledge of the lan- 
guages, a student adds greatly to his fundamental 
store of the knowledge of history and art and has a 
much fuller understanding of the peoples of the world, 
to say nothing of the more direct value due to an in- 
creased appreciation of and a more ready use of our 
native tongue. I believe that in general the broader 
gauge engineers recognize fully the cultural value of 
these subjects. : 
Mortimer E. Cootry 
Dean of College of Engineering, University of Michigan 
With a knowledge of Latin, Spanish and Portuguese 
can be learned quickly and Latin can very properly be 
considered a preparation for them. In recognition of 
this we give Spanish credit in our College of Engineer- 
ing to those who have had three or more years of Latin, 
and require only a year of work in Spanish to complete 
our requirements in modern languages. 
We also include Greek in our list of entrance require- 
ments here, and I wish every engineer had the time to 
take it. Looking back over our alumni, I am inclined 
to believe that those who have an A.B. degree in the 
classics have really shown greater brilliancy than others. 
One more thought comes to me, namely, that the en-

With a retrospect of twenty years, it seems to me 
that I am warranted in saying that I could have better 
spared any other course that I took in high school than 
the Latin. If something must have gone, if I could 
have taken but three-fourths of the subjects that I took, 
the Latin would be first and foremost, the one thing 
that would not have been left out.

most prominent engineering educators, voted unani-

was the opinion of those present that the full four years 
of a high school course should be given to a study of 
the classics, literature, history, elementary science and

The future engineer needs to learn to think during a 
formative period some years antedating his opportunity 
of acquiring that technical information that is to con- 
stitute the material of his thinking as an engineer. The 
engineer as a thinker is made during the high school 
period. To work out the meaning of a Greek or Latin 
sentence requires all the mental process of logical in- 
duction, deduction, of drawing conclusions from a mass 
of facts, and of insight, that are used in the solution of 
a complex problem in electrical engineering. 
J. Mavcus Brown 
Professor of Civil Engineering, University of South Dakota 
It is on the part the study of the classics has in pro- 
ducing the power an engineer must have that I wish to 
lay emphasis. The foundation stones of accuracy, effi- 
ciency and ability to reason, upon which power must be 
built, can be shaped by the study of the ancient lan- 
guages as well as by mathematics. These languages 
which require a close attention to detail and precision of 
interpretation, followed by close reasoning, train the 
mind of the student along the lines he must later follow 
in his professional work. The value to us is that we are 
taught how to think. Thought properly controlled is 
power.

It is my opinion that this neglect of the classics is 
one of the most serious mistakes of modern education,

and that the study of the classics is very important and 
valuable, and more so in the education of the engineer 
than in most other professions, for the reason that the 
vocation of an engineer is specially liable to make the 
man one-sided. . . . It is true that the classics are not 
necessary if the aim is to fit the student to ply the trade 
of engineer, as one plies that of the plumber or the boiler 
maker, and the world, especially the United States, is 
full of such men, who have learned merely the trade of 
engineer.

Imagination, guided by constructive thought and 
logical reasoning in the application of science, is funda- 
mental to success in the practice of the profession of 
engineering. The discoveries of science are constantly 
opening new ‘fields of engineering effort, wherein the 
vision and dreams of today become the realities of to- 
morrow. To imagine, to visualize and by the applica- 
tion of human knowledge to create that which adds to 
man’s power and control in utilizing and directing the 
resources of nature is no mean task. It is a task that 
requires a well trained mind and a nicely regulated 
judgment; characteristics probable as the result of a 
broad and liberal education and improbable as the con- 
sequence of a purely technical education. Latin is re- 
garded, and rightly so, as one of the necessities of a 
broad and liberal education.

I am afraid that what I can contribute on the question 
of the classics is of little value. In one sense I regard 
them on the same plane with mathematics, “the prince 
of all [studies] and therefore the servant of all.” (The 
exact quotation escapes me). To one who like myself 
has had the English school training with but few natu- 
ral gifts for the study of languages or literature, they 
have at least helped in realizing the value of the finer 
shades of thought and of their expression in words. 
This training went far enough to produce a critical at- 
titude in the writing of English, but failed to produce 
the excellence of style which frequently characterized 
the writings of those who made a special study of the 
classics. It is difficult for me to imagine a good English 
scholar who is not a fair classical student.

I wish it were possible for every student to be thor- 
oughly grounded in the classics and to have the great 
advantage of a broad acquaintance with the civilization 
and literature of Greece and Rome. Nevertheless I 
recognize that under present conditions this is impossi- 
ble and that even those students who do take classical 
courses too often fail to learn the languages sufficiently 
well to profit greatly by their study. The object in 
view, as I see it, is not the mechanism of a language, 
though even the details of grammar may become inter- 
esting if taught with reference to their bearing on the 
evolution of the race. 
In the case of those who do not have the opportunity 
or desire to study the classics in the original I should 
be quite willing to acquaint them with Greek literature 
through the aid of Jowett and other great translators. 
In fact I heartily believe in doing this for the benefit of 
students in the B.Sc. and B.Litt. courses, who otherwise 
would fail to have any conception of ancient times. On 
the other hand, I recognize that neither Plato nor 
Homer can be translated without becoming in some 
measure Jowett or Chapman. I shall never forget my 
surprise when first reading some of the “Inferno” in 
Italian. I had no conception of the extreme beauty of 
the original until, aided by a most superficial acquain- 
tance with the language, I glimpsed Dante himself 
through his sonorous lines. 
Faced on the one hand with the impossibility of reach- 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
         STATEMENTS 267 
ing the heart of classic authors through translations and 
on the other by the fact that so many students never 
get far enough in Greek and Latin to enjoy their read- 
ing, I see no present solution of the difficulty except to 
offer every facility for classical study and research to 
those who can make use of them, and never to forget 
the needs of the man who through limitations of any 
sort cannot study Greek or Latin. He should be given 
the best acquaintance with the classic world that Eng- 
lish can afford, and through such books as Breasted’s 
“Ancient Times” he should be made to feel how this 
civilization grew out of simpler elements and how it is 
thus related to the earlier stages in the earth’s evolution 
studied by the man of science.

I regard the study of the classics as of the greatest 
importance in the training of those who purpose to 
specialize in science. Scientists occupying posts of in- 
fluence and responsibility must be handicapped, whether 
consciously or not, by the lack of classical languages 
acquired in the ordinary preparatory and undergradu- 
ate work, of perhaps four to six years of Latin and two 
to four years of Greek. New words must be added to 
the terminology of every live branch of science, and 
such words should be based upon the classical languages 
in order to be adaptable without serious change to other 
modern languages. The teacher or investigator con- 
stantly meets such words in his work, and it certainly 
must be annoying to him if he is unable to surmise   
-P-A-G-E-276
   
      268 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
closely their meaning from his own recollections of the 
classics. 
In addition to textbooks and articles, definitions in 
dictionaries and cyclopedias are frequently sought from 
men successful in a specialty; but how can compliance 
properly be given to such requests without some under- 
standing of the classical derivation of the words in- 
volved? The editorial function also often devolves upon 
the scientist and teacher, and here in a particular degree 
the authority of the classics must be invoked on disputed 
points of rhetoric and style. 
I hardly need mention the obvious advantage of an 
early study of the classics as a foundation for that exact 
knowledge of the modern languages so essential to a 
scientific man. 
I can think of no finer example of the investigator 
and teacher well founded in the classics than the late 
Professor Charles Augustus Young, of Princeton, who 
used that knowledge with authority but without 
pedantry.

The most practical result that can be reached by a 
course of education is training the mind to think quickly 
and to draw correct conclusions from the data presented 
to it by any problem. Correct inductive thinking is, in 
my opinion, best taught to the boy in school by the hon- 
est study of the classical authors. I believe that the best 
training which a student can get in the inductive process

The domain of science is one of precise ideas. The 
expression of these ideas calls for the accurate use of 
language. No man who has definite results to describe 
ever fails to appreciate a clear and unambiguous use of 
his mother tongue. 
Granted that an American student of science ought 
to acquire the ability to write clearly in the tongue of 
Shakespeare, what is the quickest route? It is my ex- 
perience that the short path to the simple and precise 
English needed by a man of science lies through the 
tongues of Homer and Virgil. Even more essential are 
a few years of classical study for the American lad who 
hopes to acquire a perspective in the world, who hopes 
later to be liberated from his specialty, who hopes in 
short for a liberal education.

‘without Latin, I do believe that this language can con- 
tribute a large measure to it.

The man who has been profoundly trained in Latin

greater clearness and thus give them greater efficiency. 
Biological chemistry is practically written in the Greek 
language. The language of botany is essentially Latin 
in so far as the names of the plants are concerned, and 
Greek in the names which deal with the anatomy of the 
plants and their organs. The language of mathematics 
is largely Greek; the language of medicine, Greek and 
Latin combined. The common language of the home is 
largely Latin and Greek. The knowledge of Latin and

My opinion is that the classical languages are better 
taught than are the modern languages—at least that was 
my experience—and that therefore better mental train- 
ing is secured by the study of Latin and Greek. I feel 
also that a scholarly knowledge of the English language 
can only be obtained by a study of the languages, such 
as Latin, Greek and Anglo-Saxon, from which it is de- 
rived. I fail to see how a student can master the tech- 
nical vocabulary of the sciences, and particularly of the 
medical sciences, without a knowledge of the classical 
languages.

The importance of a thorough grounding in the clas- 
sics for all who seek a liberal education has been recog- 
nized and insisted upon by me ever since I left Prince- 
ton in 1878. My graduate work was done at the Royal 
Mining School at Freiberg, Saxony, and it was here, at 
the beginning of my life work, that my attention was 
first called to the extraordinary difference in mental as 
well as practical ability existing between the classically 
educated men and those whose preparation for a scien- 
tific career had been mainly technical. The most bril-
-P-A-G-E-280
  272 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
liant students in my day were the Abiturienten of the 
Gymnasia; then followed those of the Realschulen. 
The former not only led us all in the classroom and 
laboratory work, but their familiarity with’ the classics 
was remarkable. They had a fine command of lan- 
guage, an ease and confidence in conversation which was 
delightful, and their acquaintance with French and in 
some cases English surprised me. Most of them spoke 
French, and there were but few who could not at least 
read English. Their aptitude and general information 
occasioned much comment among the American college 
men. The fact that while their training had been for 
the most part classical they mastered all scientific and 
technical subjects with ease made a deep impression on 
me, for I had always supposed, when a student at 
Princeton, that the time devoted to a study of Greek 
and Latin was all lost, that the knowledge acquired 
could be of no earthly use to me as a propaedeutic to 
courses in mining and metallurgical engineering. 
I was too young and inexperienced then to realize that 
it was the mental discipline developed by the study of 
the classics which, so far as my future work was con- 
cerned, was the main thing. During the four years 
spent in Freiberg I learned too that Greek and Latin 
are valuable not only as mental disciplines, but that an 
acquaintance with the literature of the ancients at once 
stamps a man as one of parts and, whatever his profes- 
sion may be, admits him to companionship with the best 
minds. The classical education which I received at 
Princeton was certainly a great asset in winning for 
me the attention and respect of my professors and the 
better class of students. The Realschulen men were
-P-A-G-E-281
  STATEMENTS 273 
also clever and attractive, eager, enterprising and en- 
thusiastic, but, with a few exceptions, they never seemed 
to equal quite those from the Gymnasia, a fact I have 
since believed was due to the effectiveness of the Greek 
which, as is known, is required in the Gymnasia in addi- 
tion to Latin. The latter was the only ancient language 
taught in the Realgymnasia or the Realschulen, the 
students being required to devote the greater part of 
their time to mathematics, the sciences and modern lan- 
guages. I had also an excellent opportunity in those 
days to compare the classically educated American col- 
lege man with the college graduate who had specialized 
at home in mathematics and the sciences with the view 
of preparing for his engineering studies. The former 
was decidedly the abler and, so far as social influences 
and relations were concerned, by all odds the more at- 
tractive and companionable man. At the mining schools 
in my day there were students from the schools and 
educational institutions of all lands, and for this very 
reason I had an exceptionally good opportunity to gen- 
eralize. The men who had received a classical training 
were in general the best students. Later, while continu- 
ing my chemical, mineralogical and geological studies in 
Heidelberg, I noticed the same thing. The Germans, 
Americans, Englishmen, Russians, etc., who had been 
well grounded in the classics were intellectually and so- 
cially the leaders. 
These observations were made over thirty years ago, 
but I have at no time since had reason to alter my views. 
My best students in chemistry have been the candidates 
for the A.B. degree. They are brighter, more acquisi- 
tive and abler in their powers than the B.S. and Litt.B. 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  274 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
men. I regret that in recent years so few of our A.B. 
students have elected the chemical department. They 
are not always the best manipulators, but in theory they 
have certainly equalled and, in most instances, excelled 
their B.S. classmates. 
So far as the pure sciences are concerned I confine 
myself to the observations I have made as a teacher of 
chemistry. I believe, however, that in mathematics, 
physics and geology, the ablest men are also those who 
have had a classical training. I say this, and say it with- 
out any hesitancy, for I have in mind my early Freiberg 
experiences. 
The man who can do but one thing, I care not how 
well he does it, is rarely a good mixer. This one-sided- 
ness is, of course, the result of his vocational training. 
Compare many of our scientific men of today with the 
broad minded, highly cultured giants of the past gener- 
ation. The specialist has his place, it is true, does ad- 
mirable work and stands high in the esteem of his asso- 
ciates; but apart from his profession he rarely shines. 
He lacks that ease, freedom, engaging address and 
knowledge of the social and intellectual world which are 
alone characteristic of the liberally cultured. We hear 
so often nowadays that the old order is changing, that 
to keep abreast of the times our young men must de- 
vote themselves to those studies which will be of practi- 
cal use to them in after life. Many colleges have done 
away with Greek as a requirement for the A.B. degree, 
and efforts are now being made to drop Latin as a re- 
quirement for the B.S. degree. My conviction is that 
to omit the study of the Latin language in our schools 
and colleges will be to devitalize our educational sys-

tem. To relegate Greek to the category of electives is 
bad enough, but consider the intellectual status of a col- 
lege graduate who has had no Latin. 
I cannot bring myself to sympathize with the present 
utilitarian schemes of education which are the outcome 
of materialism and commercialism. The principle un- 
derlying all such schemes seems to me to be prosperity, 
material prosperity! Our sense for dignity, for beauty, 
for morality, for all that lends polish, refinement and 
elegance to life is to be neglected, or, at the most, made 
subordinate to our material welfare. I have given this 
matter much thought and am inclined to believe that the 
present tendencies in our American education are due 
mainly (1) to the intense dislike the average boy has 
for difficult tasks, (2) to the plastic and submissive na- 
ture of his parents, for American parents are proverbi- 
ally indulgent, (3) to the eagerness of the young man 
to finish his education as soon as possible and enter upon 
his vocation and (4) to the sordid tendency of apprais- 
ing every discipline according to its usefulness in pro- 
moting material success. 
The more I see of the graduates of many of our col- 
leges and universities, the more I am convinced that the 
ideas underlying our undergraduate curriculum here in 
Princeton are sound. Our record is an excellent one. 
Let us hold fast then to what reason and experience have 
taught us is best in rounding out our young men and 
preparing them for their struggles in the world. Above 
all things let us beware of making specialists of them. 
The assistants employed in our chemical department 
are not only Princeton graduates but graduates of col- 
leges scattered all over the country. These assistants 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
    276 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
are appointed annually and with the utmost care from 
a large number of splendidly recommended men. The 
Princeton graduates have thus far proved the abler. 
Their success in teaching has been more pronounced, 
they are broader in their conceptions and sympathies 
than most of the men from the other colleges, have a 
more thorough grasp of the science of chemistry as a 
whole, and their ease and self-assurance are marks 
which indicate the effectiveness of their liberal training. 
My belief is that the Latin which is required of all 
our college students is in no small degree responsible 
for the exceptionally good showing made by these men. 
It is a significant fact too that our assistants and 
instructors who have had Greek in addition to Latin, 
our A.B. graduates, have turned out to be the most bril- 
liant of all. So far then as my experience as a scientific 
man goes, I can find in these recent educational schemes 
nothing which approaches in disciplinary value the lib- 
eral system in use here in Princeton, a system in which 
Latin is one of the requirements. 
Omitting the role played by the classics as regards 
mental discipline, their value, as I see it, may be stated 
very briefly: 
Familiarity with the Greek and Latin grammars is 
of considerable importance in that it aids us in master- 
ing our own tongue, and in acquiring a knowledge of 
other modern languages; 
So closely interwoven are the conceptions and ideals 
of the ancients in the literature of the moderns that to 
read intelligently any of the famous works of the latter 
assumes some knowledge of the humanities, and 
The study of the classics effects a charm, a refine-

ment, a polish, instantly felt but impossible to describe. 
To be conversant with the great productions of the 
writers and artists of antiquity, works which time and 
experience have stamped .as models of perfection, is to 
possess a power recognized in all walks of life. He 
who has mastered his profession and acquired in addi- 
tion at least some acquaintance with the humanities is 
the truly liberally educated man. Mere knowledge 
gives weight, but lustre alone gives charm. The prac- 
tically educated man lacks lustre. Both attainments 
are essential. In the great world knowledge unadorned 
may command respect, but it never captivates. Mater- 
iam superabat opus.

Louis KAHLENBERG

Permit me to state that I consider work in languages 
and mathematics of special importance as a preparation 
for a scientific career in the university. I have always 
felt that scientific students are especially lacking in lin- 
guistic training, which is to a considerable extent to be 
ascribed to the fact that even in their high school work 
they begin to devote time to the study of sciences which 
ought to be devoted to securing a solid foundation in 
languages. The study of German is of special impor- 
tance to any one who intends to pursue science, but I 
feel that a knowledge of Latin is extremely desirable. 
And certainly the mental training that comes to a stu- 
dent who has studied both Greek and Latin in addition 
to German is especially calculated to give him that men- 
tal strength which is so essential to students in future 
scientific work. The work in science can best be done in 
a university, and any student in a high school who is 
looking forward to a scientific course in the university 
would, in my opinion, do well to spend a major portion 
of his time upon the study of mathematics and classics. 
I make these statements because of my experience with 
students of about equal ability who have devoted their
-P-A-G-E-287

time to classics on the one hand, and elementary science 
on the other, before approaching scientific work in the 
university. Ultimately the stronger men have invari- 
ably been those who have had strong basal work in lan- 
guages and mathematics.

I owe a very deep debt to my studies in philosophy 
and the classics while at Princeton. Greek is so closely 
interwoven with all biologic language and thought, and 
the Greek philosophers are so inspiring in their incur- 
sions into natural philosophy and zoology that without 
a Greek foundation one certainly cannot reach the philo- 
sophic or the cultural level in modern biology. The 
same is true, in a less degree, of Latin. In “The Greeks 
to Darwin” and in my recent work “Men of the Old 
Stone Age” I have traced the sources of all modern 
biologic thought back to the Greeks. Their anticipa- 
tion of modern theories and speculations is little short 
of miraculous, considering the comparatively slender 
range of their observations. The same holds true in 
lesser measure of Latin, which since the time of Lin- 
naeus has been the thought companion of the naturalist. 
As I recall the methods of my Latin and Greek edu-

cation, however, I am impressed with the lack of inspira- 
tion and of vitality, and believe that the survival of 
these studies in the future depends largely upon the 
ability of our teachers of the classics to draw constant- 
ly the parallel between ancient and modern thought and 
life, the cause of which doubtless lies in our unchanging 
human nature.

My life has been given over to scientific problems of 
varying calibre and I am often reckoned by my col- 
leagues and, I think, the outside world as a matter of 
course the product of the technical school. I am very 
happy and have always been very happy that I am not 
that, even though I today have only Greek enough to 
help me anneal mongrel scientific names, and just suffi- 
cient shredded Latin to keep me in touch with the din- 
ners of Lucullus. I owe to a rigorous discipline in 
Greek and in Latin, a substratum upon which, I believe, 
with natural tastes for science, I have been able to build 
such superstructure as now stands to my credit or other- 
wise. 
The effort so obviously abroad in the world to repress 
the classical training of youth will, I may say for 
science, prick the happiest dreams and the most com- 
pelling hopes of any philosophy which has its foothold 
in the phenomena of nature.

The principal function of education is to teach men 
and women to think and thereby prepare them to act. 
The first and most important measure of the educa- 
tional value of a particular study or course of study is, 
therefore, its effect in developing accuracy and rapidity 
in the reasoning powers of the students. If such study 
also furnishes information which will be of future value, 
a double object is accomplished. Many of us, however, 
recognize only the value of the information acquired 
and lose sight of the fact that the first essential of edu- 
cation is the training of the mind. That the study of 
Latin affords an excellent drill is recognized by all stu- 
dents of the classics. Latin textbooks are excellent, 
and, as a result, the teaching of Latin is generally thor- 
ough and satisfactory. 
The study of Latin is more than a mental drill, how- 
ever. It furnishes a knowledge of the modern lan- 
guages, French, Spanish, Italian and English, which 
cannot be acquired in any other way, since Latin has 
given to those languages in considerable measure their 
form and vocabulary. To us, of course, the effect on 
the acquirement of a working knowledge of the English 
language is of greatest importance. In my opinion the 
training in the conversion of ideas into clear, concise 
and accurate language is second only in importance, as 
a function of education, to the training of the mind in 
reasoning. Each one must convert his thought into 
spoken or written language, and the greater the ability 
to do this the better the chances for one to rise to a po-

sition of both influence and affluence. From observa- 
tion of several hundred college graduates I am con- 
vinced that the average man who completes a college 
course is wholly weak in his ability to speak and write 
English. A study of Latin will, in my opinion, assist 
to remedy this deficiency. 
W. J. Hotianp

In the higher walks of scientific research, more par- 
ticularly as represented by the so-called “natural sci- 
ences,” a good knowledge of the Latin and Greek lan- 
guages is almost indispensable. The terminology of 
these sciences is derived almost wholly from these two 
languages, and the coining of new generic and specific 
names, which are constantly called for as the boundaries 
of knowledge are enlarged, demands of the student— 
especially if he be engaged in descriptive work—a rea- 
sonable familiarity with the Greek language, the laws 
which govern the combination of words in that tongue, 
and their Latinization. A knowledge of the rules gov- 
erning inflections and their significance is of great im- 
portance, to the end that ridiculous blunders be not 
perpetrated. I will not go into details, as I might, but 
will quote what one of my dear friends, the late Profes- 
sor Edward Hitchcock, once said in my hearing. Re- 
ferring to the labors of his famous father, President 
Hitchcock, who was one of the foremost geologists of 
America, he remarked, “My father never could have 
written his great work upon the fossil footprints of the 
Connecticut Valley had he not been able to read the 
poems of Homer in the original.”

There is no doubt that a knowledge of Latin and 
Greek is of great service to the student of science. Most 
of our scientific terms are derived from one or the other 
of these languages; these technical terms are frequently 
disturbing or even terrifying to the uninitiated, but they 
are usually intelligible and full of significance to the 
student familiar with the classical languages.

  Cures E. Bessey 
Late Professor of Botany, University of Nebraska 
I have always urged students who hope to do much 
botany to prepare themselves in Latin and Greek. It 
is a rule among systematic botanists that all descrip- 
tions of new species must be in Latin, and it is the prac- 
tice of many to write all of their general systematic 
works in the Latin language. The standard descrip- 
tive works are in Latin. For this reason I urge every 
student who looks to systematic work in botany to have 
an adequate preparation in Latin. The need for Greek 
is somewhat different, since it is important to the botan- 
ist in connection with the etymologies of a multitude of 
technical terms, and especially the scientific names of 
plants and plant groups, phyla, classes, orders, fami- 
lies and genera. 
In my experience as a teacher of botany to college 
students I have urged them to secure first a good foun- 
dation in Latin and Greek, and, while I have trained 
some young botanists who have had only “little Latin 
and less Greek,” it is true that all have profitably made 
use of all the classical training they have had, and very 
generally have wished for more.

Latin courses. How far the training in the language 
work was of service as intellectual exercise I don’t feel 
able to say; certainly I not only do not regret the time 
spent in languages but I should be very sorry to have 
missed the pleasure the language work afforded me, 
whether or not my scientific work was aided. At any 
rate I am sure my outlook was broadened by this work 
and a permanent source of pleasure provided. 
SPENCER TROTTER

I consider a course of classical study, both in Latin 
and Greek, an essential foundation to the right under- 
standing and appreciation of any science. 
It gives a certain value and perspective to human 
affairs which comes from a knowledge of the culture 
and thought of the past. 
The influence of classical study is broadening in that 
it tends to counteract the often too restricted and my- 
opic vision of scientific specialism. 
No knowledge of a science can properly be acquired 
until the terminology of that science is mastered, and 
this terminology is in the main of Greek and Latin 
origin. 
Aside from mere science, however, the pleasure de- 
rived from even a casual acquaintance with the words 
and thoughts of the ancient writers is in itself enough to 
make a study of the classics invaluable.

valuable to any one who uses language as an expres-

While Latin is not an essential, even for leaders of 
the race, and while for one schoolboy in five it may be 
only a vexing luxury, nevertheless in my opinion it is 
our most effective instrument of training for all who are

to reveal grammar at its best. The language of Cicero

rarely if ever found in English. Through variance with 
our own language in word order, in means of concise- 
ness and energy, in metaphors, colors and the subtler 
artistries of wording, Latin lets us into the finest secrets 
of good craftsmanship. The history of English verse 
and prose, in their noblest periods, yields the best argu- 
ment for modern mastery of the classics and particu- 
larly for a working love of Latin. 
Tatcorr WILLIAMS

  The “English” which those who have had four years 
of training in the high school write is lamentable. Men 
who have had one, two, three and sometimes four years 
in our colleges are without knowledge of the first prin- 
ciples by which the writer must be guided. They un- 
derstand less how a fact must be recorded, an opinion 
expressed, an argument made convincing or an event 
touched with imagination than those who have been 
through the drill of the city room and the news desk. 
These are the practical results which accompany the 
great change in our education in the last forty years, 
which has supplanted the old learning by the new. 
Fortunately, while the study of Latin has greatly de- 
creased in our colleges as compared with twenty to 
forty years ago, and Greek, save here and there, is taken 
by so few that in one college of the first rank it 
was not possible to award the Greek prizes, the study of 
Latin in our secondary schools has greatly increased. 
In 1890 a little more than one-third (34.69 per cent) 
studied Latin. In our public high schools for the past 
ten years this number has reached 50 per cent. This

army of high school students constitutes the largest ar- 
ray of youth studying an ancient tongue ever gathered 
under the national system of schools in any land. Such 
improvement as has come in the English written in our 
high schools is, I believe, due to this cause. It is, at all 
events, the experience of the School of Journalism that 
those who have a classical education write better than 
those who are without it.

Here, whatever else may be lacking, is discipline. 
The sheer difficulty of Latin and Greek, the highly or- 
ganized structure of these languages, the need of scrup- 
ulous search to find the nearest equivalents for words 
that differ widely in their scope of meaning from their 
derivatives in any modern vocabulary, the effort of lift- 
ing one’s self out of the familiar rut of ideas into so 
foreign a world, all these things act as a tonic exercise 
to the brain. And it is a demonstrable fact that stu- 
dents of the classics do actually surpass their unclassi- 
cal rivals in any field where a fair test can be made. 
We shall, then, make a long step forward when we 
determine that in the college, as distinguished from the 
university, it is better to have the great mass of men, 
whatever may be the waste in a few unmalleable minds, 
go through the discipline of a single group of studies— 
with, of course, a considerable freedom of choice in the 
outlying field. And it will probably appear in experi- 
ence that the only practicable group to select is the 
classics, with the accompaniment of philosophy and the 
mathematical sciences. Latin and Greek are, at least,
-P-A-G-E-298
  
290 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
as disciplinary as any other subjects; and if it can be 
further shown that they possess a specific power of cor- 
rection for the more disintegrating tendencies of the 
age, it ought to be clear that their value as instruments 
of education outweighs the service of certain studies 
which may seem more immediately serviceable. 
What we need chiefly is a deeper knowledge and 
finer understanding of those few authors who are really 
the classics. We need to reassure ourselves that as pure 
human literature they still stand supreme and unap- 
proached. I for one am ready to avow my opinion, and 
I believe that no great advance in the classics is possible 
until this belief is proclaimed boldly and generally, that 
the “Iliad” and “Odyssey” have a beauty and humanity 
that no modern epic poet has ever touched—not Milton 
himself, though I adore Milton this side of idolatry. 
There is no lyric poetry in modern tongues that has the 
music and exquisite feeling of Sappho’s Lesbian songs, 
or the soaring strength of Pindar’s impassioned vision. 
No one else has ever quite caught again the mellow 
suavity of Horace. No later philosopher has translated 
_ the eternal verities into such perfect speech as Plato. I 
have seen Edwin Booth in “Lear” and “Macbeth” and 
“Hamlet,” and felt the grip of Shakespeare at my very 
heart. But I have seen a band of young amateurs pre- 
sent the “Agamemnon” in the stadium at Harvard, and 
through the crudeness of their acting and the helpless- 
ness of the chorus and the disadvantage of a language I 
could scarcely follow, I still knew that here was a higher 
form of drama than anything on the modern stage, and 
that the art of Aeschylus was profounder and more ever- 
lasting in its emotional appeal than Shakespeare’s even.

Though I have not been conscious of making definite 
effort to “use” the classics, I am certain that my early 
studies of Latin and Greek have proved to be of prac- 
tical value. The terms used in the scientific world are 
largely and in some sciences almost exclusively derived 
from the classics. New inventions and discoveries call 
for new descriptive words, and these are very largely of 
classical origin. Hence the knowledge of the so-called 
“dead” languages (which are not so dead as might be 
supposed) is helpful in assisting one to a more ready 
understanding, when he is reading in a new or more or 
less unfamiliar field. Furthermore, a knowledge of the 
classics gives to the writer a more intimate knowledge 
of the meanings of words, and a more just discrimina- 
tion in their use. His vocabulary will be larger, and his 
writings will possess, probably, more of the elements 
necessary to constitute what is known as style.

I am both a vocationalist and a culturist and there-

true cultural education ought to enable him to do his 
share of the world’s work more efficiently. In the his- 
tory of education in this country the pendulum first 
swings to one side and then to the other. Thirty or 
forty years ago too much emphasis was laid upon the 
so-called humanities. There was a natural reaction with 
which I personally sympathized; but now, in my judg- 
ment, too much emphasis is being laid upon those forms 
of education which will enable a man to make his daily

between the camp which is tagged “vocational” and the 
camp which is tagged “cultural” it has often seemed to

nothing can be done efficiently or well without the in-

some, at least, if not a large part of their inspiration 
from Greek and Latin literature. This is a demonstra- 
ble fact. If it were equally demonstrable that Assyrian 
or Sanskrit or Hebrew or Arabic or Chinese had con- 
tributed as much as Latin and Greek to the inspiration 
of the imagination, then I should hope a body similar 
to yours would defend these languages. No reasonable 
man I suppose stands for universal compulsory study 
of Greek and Latin, but the truth is that the anti-classic- 
ists in their opposition to compulsion are making it dif- 
ficult even for the small percentage who desire and 
ought to be encouraged to volunteer for the study of 
Greek and Latin. By all means let us have our schools 
of applied science, of technical professions and of com- 
mercial training, but let us also have some schools where 
those men who are to be the leaders in the art of liter- 
ary expression may go to the two great sources of that 
art, the Greek and Latin classics. Most of us have to 
get modern French, German and Russian literature 
through translations, but any man who understands - 
even one modern language so that he can read it with 
pleasure and comfort knows that the effect upon the 
mind and spirit of an essay, a play or poem is extra- 
ordinarily different in the original from even the best 
English translation. I get occasional refreshment and 
joy out of Calverly’s translation of Theocritus. How 
much more must the man who can read the Greek origi- 
nal. Few colleges or universities can have great labor- 
atories and machine shops, but the smallest college can 
have a good library. But the man who does not have

at least a respectful bowing acquaintance with Latin 
and Greek literature cannot be entirely happy and at 
home in a fine library. It is to be hoped that there will 
always be American boys and men who will desire and 
possess opportunities to study Latin and Greek i in order 
that they may pass along to their fellows some of the 
beauty of the old poets, essayists and historians.

had delivered his once famous Phi Beta Kappa address, 
called “A College Fetich,” some one (Professor A. S. 
Hill, I think) remarked that for him to say he had got 
nothing from his Greek was like an atheist’s saying that 
he had got nothing from Christianity. Most of us use 
in our daily life no mathematics except addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication and division; but. most of us 
are not so rash as to say that we got nothing from 
algebra and geometry. I for one have always been glad 
that I was obliged to study Latin, Greek and mathe- 
matics, and glad that when compulsion ceased I elected 
Latin and Greek. I have often wondered whether we 
do better for our students in abandoning the old pre- 
scribed Freshman year, in which the Freshman class as 
a whole was put through a certain amount of cultivat- 
ing and disciplinary study on the basis of which the in- 
dividuals were allowed later to use great freedom in 
election. I do not know that I should go back willing- 
ly to the old scheme; but I have grave doubts whether 
we have not, as it were, knocked out the underpinning 
of many an education. 
We see nowadays even specialists in literature who 
have had scarcely any training in the classics. Every, 
year I work in English composition with a class of 
picked men. Those who are well trained in the classics 
are comparatively few, but they always have something 
to build:'on which the other men lack.

Henry van Dye 
Recently Minister from the United States to the Netherlands 
Professor of English Literature in Princeton University VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
I think that the great value of classical studies in 
liberal education is twofold. First, they promote a 
more clear and thorough apprehension of the structure 
and significance of the various languages of mankind. 
All human languages are by no means of equal rank. 
Greek and Latin are certainly among the more perfect, 
if not altogether the most perfect of those vehicles of 
thought and feeling which have developed out of human 
intercourse and civilization. They are in a way norms 
and standards by which to measure the merits and de- 
merits of other languages. This service is entirely apart 
from the value of Greek and Latin in helping us to a 
quicker understanding of modern words which are de- 
rived from Roman or Greek roots. 
Second, a still higher value of classical studies lies in 
the opportunity which Greek and Latin literature gives 
us to obtain a broader and better view of the permanent 
elements of human life and progress. It may be said 
that we could get this view equally well from transla- 
tions. But that is not quite true. There is something 
in an Ode of Horace read in the original, which is never 
found in the translation, however good it may be. The 
sweep of the Virgilian line and of the Virgilian thought 
may be imitated in English, but it cannot really be re- 
produced. To read even a little of the classics in the 
original tongues makes an effect upon the mind, which, 
although it may be forgotten, is in my opinion hardly 
ever lost.

ALFRED Noyes

The value of classical studies is very clear to the stu- 
dent of English literature. Quite apart from the fact 
that it is impossible to appreciate many of the master- 
pieces in our glorious literature without some acquain- 
tance with the original flavor of the Greek and Roman 
poets, it is also true that the increasing carelessness of 
modern writing, the more slipshod use of words and the 
dearth of great masters of style during the last twenty 
years are probably due to the neglect of classical studies. 
It used to be said that the best training for a writer of 
English was a course of Latin prose. Certainly those 
who have had it usually display a sense of style, a sense 
of the logic of language, of the structure of sentences 
and of the inner significance, the delicate shades of 
meaning in words that to others appear synonymous. 
I am not speaking here, of course, of the exceptional 
genius. But though Shakespeare himself may have had 
“small Latin and less Greek,” it is quite certain that he 
had more than most students of today. Even if he di- 
gested it so completely that he forgot it in later years, 
it is also quite certain that it enriched his mental life 
and nourished the sinews of the most athletic style in 
all literature. 
All the great masters of our own language have used 
it with an eye to its inner meanings. When Stevenson 
wrote of the “tremendous neighbourhood” of a volcanic 
mountain, he was going down to the roots of things, 
and if his faith were not enough to move mountains he 
was at least able to shake them visibly before the reader. 
Milton both shook them and moved them in the same 
power, where others might only have hurled large ad-

jectives at the indifferent skies. Nobody can ever un- 
derstand Matthew Arnold’s poem on his dog’s grave 
without the recollection of the most exquisite line in all 
Roman poetry, and no translation can give the music 
that has haunted the world of literature for nearly two 
thousand years: 
Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt. 
For the truth is that though Latin and Greek in a super- 
ficial sense may be “dead languages” they are living 
literature. A great work of art, statue or picture or 
poem, can never be “dead.” ‘There is a confusion of 
thought in most of those who apply the word so glibly 
to the world’s most vital heritage. It is not without 
significance that the most beautiful greeting ever ad- 
dressed by one poet to another was given by the great- 
est poet of the nineteenth century to a poet who died 
nearly two thousand years earlier. For both men were, 
and are, alive and immortal: 
Now thy forum soars no longer, 
Fallen every purple Caesar’s dome, 
Yet thine ocean roll of rhythm 
Sounds forever of Imperial Rome. 
Now the Rome of slaves hath perished, 
And the Rome of free men holds her place, 
I, from out the northern Island, 
Sundered once from all the human race, 
I salute thee, Mantovano, 
I that loved thee since my day began, 
Wielder of the stateliest measure 
Ever moulded by the lips of man.

I believe that the value of any study depends less on 
its content than on the spirit in which it is pursued. I 
believe that subjects pursued for what is called “their 
practical utility” or subjects readily convertible into 
utilitarian terms are, to the extent of that immediate 
utility, less valuable as contrasted with subjects in which 
there is play for that firm spirit that comes of disinter- 
ested endeavor. Wealth of human interest and remote- 
ness from present application seem to me the two im- 
portant factors in any subject chosen best to foster this 
disinterested endeavor of which I speak. And the 
classics of ancient Greece and Rome appear to me best 
of all studies to fulfil these conditions. 
We need much besides in modern education; but mod- 
ern education is still incomplete without the classics for 
which our ingenuity has found and probably will find 
no genuine substitute. 
Virernia C, GILDERSLEEVE

Of all the various reasons for the study of the 
classics, two have long appealed to me as the most im- 
portant. Though both apply to either language, the 
first is especially applicable to Latin, the second to 
Greek. Both seem to me very practical. 
A fairly thorough study of Latin gives, I believe, an 
admirable linguistic foundation. Linguistic training is 
surely an important part of education for a boy or a 
girl. I mean by this the careful analysis of language, 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  300 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
with grammar, syntax and accurate distinctions in 
shades of meaning. When this is done thoroughly for 
one language others can be built upon it more rapidly 
and easily. As it happens our own tongue, English, 
being an illogical and loosely constructed language, is 
ill adapted for the fundamental training. Latin, on 
the other hand, logical and well knit, serves this purpose 
well. It is, besides, useful as a stepping stone to the 
modern languages which are its daughters. 
The study of Greek is extremely valuable in another 
way. It most resembles in its effect travel in foreign 
lands and types of civilization, higher, in some ways, 
than our own. Like travel, Greek opens and broadens 
one’s mind. I am profoundly thankful that the college 
entrance requirements of my undergraduate days forced 
this blessing upon me. 
Lane Coorer 
Professor of English Language and Literature, Cornell University 
Those relatively few young persons of our day who 
possess an adequate grounding in Greek and Latin have 
this in common with the English poets: they know some- 
thing about grammar—not English grammar specifi- 
cally, nor Greek, nor Latin, but grammar in general. 
They recognize subject, copula and predicate whenever 
they meet them; they have an understanding for order 
and relation in the parts of a sentence. They are ac- 
customed to see the elements of language as elements, 
and are not incapable of arranging them. They know 
the difference between a temporal and a causal con- 
nective; they can distinguish between post hoc and 
propter hoc—a highly important distinction in life. 
The reason they can do so is that whereas it is possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
    STATEMENTS 301 
to express oneself either loosely or straitly in English, 
according to one’s previous education, both Greek and 
Latin compel the schoolboy to make a sharp distinction 
between one thought and another. This is precisely 
what those who have missed a severe linguistic training 
are never prone to do. There may be exceptions; if so, 
these are negligible. In the long run, they who have 
done well with Greek or Latin in the preparatory school 
can write passable English as freshmen, and they who 
have studied neither are ungrammatical and otherwise 
slovenly in usage. 
Lucy Martin DonneELLY

A knowledge of Latin and Greek is essential, in my 
opinion, to a true appreciation of English literature. 
From Chaucer and Shakespeare to Stephen Phillips 
and Robert Bridges the sources of English literature 
have been largely in ancient history and story. To read 
many of the finest English poems, Milton’s “Lycidas” 
for instance, without a knowledge of the classics is to 
miss the importance of their associations and allusions 
and the beauty of their language. 
JosepH V. DENNEY

Thousands of people have testified to the fact that 
not until they had studied a second language did Eng- 
lish grammar become clear to them. And the second 
language should by all means be Latin, partly because 
of the completeness of its grammatical apparatus, but 
chiefly because the native English sentence was first 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  802 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
made orderly, logical, serviceable and efficient under the 
influence of the grammar of Latin. The management 
of clauses, for instance, of tense sequence, of indirect 
discourse, of linking apparatus, of position and prepo- 
sition—so troublesome in writing English—is learned 
from Latin as a matter of necessity. It is seldom learned 
thoroughly through English alone, as any journalist 
can testify or illustrate. 
The student of English, if devoid of Latin and Greek, 
must pick and choose his reading with great care if he 
would maintain his interest for long. He will find 
whole periods of English prose impossible and much of 
English verse beyond his imaginative reach. He must 
confine himself to the contemporaneous, and often suffer 
the feeling of detachment even there. He is debarred 
from real intellectual sympathy with no inconsiderable 
portion of nineteenth century prose and verse—to men- 
tion only the more familiar names, with portions of 
Longfellow, Lowell and Emerson, the Arnolds, the 
Brownings, the Morrises, Landor, Keats, Shelley, By- 
ron, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Macaulay, Newman, 
George Eliot, Ruskin, Rossetti, Pater, and even Tom 
Moore. 
The future of real English study is bound up with 
that of the other languages and especially Latin and 
Greek.

The results of this experiment may be summarized 
briefly in the form of “laws” as follows: 
A student’s power over the English dictionary varies 
directly with the number of years in which he has stud-

A student’s acquaintance with the commonplaces of 
classical allusion varies directly with the number of years 
in which he has studied Latin. 
A student’s ability to read a page of Shakespeare 
varies directly with the number of years in which he 
has studied Latin. 
J. C. FREEMAN 
Late Professor of English Literature, University of Wisconsin 
On entering a preparatory school at the age of thir- 
teen, I was so fortunate as to have my attention di- 
rected to the study of Greek, and for several years in 
school and college I devoted to it a portion of each day. 
Not a day has passed since then without my finding 
it of great use tome. I never read an essay, an article 
in a newspaper, even an advertisement, without my 
Greek enabling me to understand it better. I have a 
private wire on Plato and Aristotle and I hear their 
comments on the most recent Philippine complication 
and the latest automobile. I am always delighted to 
find in my classes some who have studied Greek. I ex- 
pect and I find in them a finer appreciation of literature. 
At our university jubilee, at which we had representa- 
tives from all parts of the world, I was interested to 
notice that the speakers who spoke most to the point 
and in the best taste, and who charmed and delighted 
their audiences were invariably men of classical training. 
I should think it fortunate if young persons of either

sex who propose to acquire a thorough education should 
lay the foundations of it in a study of the Greek lan- 
guage and literature. 
Harpin Craic

My experience since I left Princeton, in an institu- 
tion in which classical studies have been more and more 
subordinated to science and to studies having to do with 
vocation, has led me to think it essential that effective 
measures be taken by American college teachers of all 
liberal branches to restore classical studies to a position 
of importance in the curricula of schools and colleges. 
The plans outlined for modern practical courses of 
study may incidentally and indirectly lead to the culti- 
vation of taste and the possession of ideals. They sub- 
stitute something else in their place, a thing which I 
am by no means disposed to undervalue or discredit. 
Perhaps it is in most cases enough, but as a cultural 
agency the modern course of study, when it is made up 
without the classics, is hopelessly limited; for culture 
seems to reside in the classics. I merely generalize upon 
my observation of the standards of estimate in life. 
The chances are that those persons who have some- 
how learned what a classic is, what the classics are and 
why they are classics, however imperfectly, will be con- 
sidered by their associates as cultivated persons; and 
those who are not so fortunate will not. If those trained 
only in the practical manner have risen to the same cul- 
tural level as those trained in the classics, it will usually 
be found that they have gained the classical point of 
view from early environment or that, like ill prepared 
graduate students, they have gone back and read their
-P-A-G-E-313
  
STATEMENTS 305 
classics. Some acquaintance with the literature and 
philosophy of the ancient world seems always necessary. 
I would not be narrow as to the method of approach. 
Keats was no less great an exponent of classic culture 
though he knew no Greek than was Shelley, who was a 
Platonist and a student of Sophocles. But that the 
world judges ultimately by the spirit of the classics, 
I should not be disposed for an instant to doubt. 
Cartes Minis GayLey

For prospective teachers of English and Latin, Greek 
is the elective subject first in importance. The student’s 
general culture in other lines is adequately provided for 
by the required studies of school and university, so that 
this advice, to future specialists in Latin or English, 
may be given with the utmost emphasis, and without 
fear of too great limitation of the student’s range.

The longer I teach English the more I am convinced 
that training in the classics, especially in Latin, is an 
all but indispensable adjunct to training in English 
composition and English literature. 
My opinon is that for the successful study of English 
in college a sound preparation in Latin is even more 
necessary than a preparation in English itself.“ Other 
things being equal, I prefer a student who has had four 
years preparation in Latin and only two in English to 
one who has had but two years preparation in Latin and 
four years in English.

Few people, few teachers even, seem to realize that 
proficiency in constructing sentences, in fitting together 
in the English order the clauses of a sentence composed 
in the Latin order, is an exercise in practical logic of 
the most rigorous kind. It is logic expressed not in 
formulae and equations but in the universal medium of 
intercourse. 
Students equipped in this way I find to be more 
capable than others of addressing their minds to prob- 
lems of expression and of literary appreciation. The 
difference in grasp, in discrimination and in economy of 
effort is astonishing.

The question, then, as to the place which classical 
study should have in our modern system of education 
must be considered mainly from this point of view, how 
does it serve the great ends which literary education in 
general serves? What is its special place there? Is 
some direct knowledge of it essential to complete true 
literary education, or is it only a helpful addition as any 
other literature might be, in some degree at least? 
Most educationalists in our day are ready enough to 
admit the deep and delicate organic filaments which 
connect Graeco-Roman civilization with that of our 
own time. Great material and political changes have 
rather disguised than altered our relationship. The 
structural forms of our poetry and oratory and the logi- 
cal forms of our reasoning were grafted by the men of 
the Renaissance on Graeco-Roman literature. Many 
of the masterpieces of modern literature, Dante’s “Di-
-P-A-G-E-315
  STATEMENTS 307 
vina Commedia,” Milton’s “Paradise Lost,’ Arnold’s 
“Thyrsis,” and indeed all our great pastoral elegies and 
idylls bind us fast to the classical world both by what 
they recall and by what they imply, though literary criti- 
cism has not yet done as much as it might have with that 
last point. Most of the important documents in the his- 
tory of our civilization cannot be read at first hand, with 
a full sense of possession and enjoyment, without a 
knowledge of Latin at least. And if the color of the 
Graeco-Roman mind runs strongly in our literature, it 
is still more marked in our language. The diction of the 
newspapers we read is, as far as nouns, verbs and adjec- 
tives which give color to speech are concerned, fifty per 
cent of it, Graeco-Roman. Our philosophic and scien- 
tific terminology is wholly so. Even outside of literature 
our indebtedness to that classical world is still very 
great. Our modern jurisprudence has been culled out 
of the maxims of Roman law. The civic buildings I 
see every day in this land where the Huron once built 
his wigwam are the work of the Graeco-Roman mind, 
adapted to modern use by the Italian of the Renais- 
sance. The modern builder contributed only the stone 
and lime. We could not fancy Chinese pagodas or even 
the magnificent structures of the Mohammedan con- 
querors of India rising in their place. And yet the only 
reason why not is the Graeco-Roman mould of our 
taste and ideas.

The real defence of the study of Latin is bound up 
with a proper conception of what education is. If the
-P-A-G-E-316
  308 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
chief object in life, whether of the individual or the com- 
munity, is to attain material results, if the main purpose 
of education is vocational, then Latin must go. But if 
life consists in something else than the multitude of 
things which the individual or the community possesses, 
and if, in consequence, the purpose of education is to 
produce the highest character and intellectual develop- 
ment which inherited capacities, environment and cir- 
cumstances permit, then a strong claim can be made 
for the importance of classical studies as an essential 
element in the best liberal education. * * * 
If the classical languages have a sufficient recogni- 
tion in the secondary schools there need be little fear 
about their position in the universities. On the other 
hand, unless the curriculum of the schools gives en- 
couragement to the study of the classics, it is inevitable 
that neither Latin nor Greek will occupy a much bet- 
ter position than does Hebrew at present. If the natu- 
ral age for acquiring language be passed before Latin 
and Greek are begun, a satisfactory knowledge is, we 
may say, impossible. But granted the needful prelimi- 
nary training at school, it does not seem to me that there 
is any danger of Latin and Greek being neglected in 
the universities. Minds of the literary or philosophic 
type are naturally drawn toward the classics, where are 
to be found the beginning, for the western world, of the 
most important phases of literature, criticism, meta- 
physics, ethics, political theory, law and history. The 
importance of a first hand acquaintance with Latin, and 
especially with Greek, has an obviousness that makes 
argument superfluous. I will therefore close with a 
statement of my personal opinion as a teacher of Eng- 
lish literature, that Greek and Latin are in this depart-
-P-A-G-E-317

ment a matter of first importance. Where else can be 
found a mass of material that has exercised so profound 
and continuous an influence both on the form and on the 
thought of English writers?

An eminent professor in a scientific school has been 
heard to declare that he would rather have, as advanced 
students of applied science, men who had devoted them- 
selves to Latin than those who had spent their time on 
scientific studies; and his voice is one of many. Col- 
lege instructors in English composition are sometimes 
heard to regret that their pupils ever tried to write Eng- 
lish at school. It appears to be the unanimous opinion 
of college professors of modern languages that their 
best pupils are those whose school years were given 
mostly to Greek and Latin, while their poorest are those 
in whose previous curriculum French or German or 
“science” was the principal factor. On the other hand, 
the boy from a good classical school finds that his col- 
lege Latin, Greek and mathematics are the natural con- 
tinuation of what he has already acquired; and his in- 
structor, with no great upsetting or reviewing, simply 
takes him on from the point he has reached under the 
guidance of his former teacher. 
It would seem, then, if our data and inferences are 
correct, that Latin, Greek and mathematics are so 
taught as to allow but little waste in the passage from 
one teacher to another, while in other subjects the ap- 
parent or real loss is most discouraging. Furthermore, 
school study of the classics furnishes not only an ex-
-P-A-G-E-318
    810 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
cellent basis for further work along the same line, but 
also the best foundation for studies of a different char- 
acter; while modern language courses, in common with 
science and some other topics, far from fitting a pupil 
to take up new branches of study, do not adequately 
prepare him to continue what he has begun. It is likely 
enough that French and German, as taught today, are 
more effective than most of the other new studies, but 
they are still vastly inferior to the classics. And inas- 
much as the modern tongues to a considerable extent 
have replaced Greek and Latin in the secondary school 
curriculum and in the ordinary college training, we can- 
not regard any instruction in them as satisfactory which 
does not produce results comparable to those derived 
from the study of the old humanities. 
From time immemorial until our own generation the 
fundamental discipline of educated men throughout the 
civilized world has been derived from Latin and Greek, 
with more or less admixture of mathematics. The great 
writers, the imposing figures in history, the mighty 
scholars of every type have formed their intelligence on 
the classics; all that we revere in the intellectual past 
derives from that abundant source. The majestic tra- - 
dition of classic study gives to the old humanities a 
dignity that newer branches of learning can never at- 
tain, unless it be after many centuries of like achieve- 
ment. 
One can speak with real confidence only of one’s own 
experience. For my part, I can say that, without the 
excellent classical training received in my youth, my 
work as a scholar and writer would have been quite im- 
possible, and, as far as I can judge, the intellectual

I should welcome any attempt to put Latin back into 
its old place in the curriculum of our secondary schools. 
Of all the languages it is the one which has the great- 
est educational value, and for obvious reasons: 
It is simple in its construction, and yet has enough 
declensions and flexions to give the student an intimate 
knowledge of the exact relations of the words of a sen- 
tence to one another—a knowledge in which most of our 
students are sadly lacking. In this way it is a great 
help in the study of English. 
In Latin of the classical period, at any rate, sentences 
are closely connected, and their order, dependence and 
relation are apparent and logical. One cannot translate 
Latin into another language without learning at the 
same time how to think logically, to make an argument 
forcefully, and to present one’s ideas in a simple and 
clear way. 
This mental discipline and this habit of looking 
squarely at facts and ideas, which made the Romans the 
greatest jurists the world has ever known, are qualities 
no man can afford to neglect, and Latin, in my opin- 
ion, is the shortest and easiest way to acquire or develop 
them.

I cannot conceive of what my work as a teacher of 
German literature and a student of German intellectual 
and artistic life would have been but for the thorough 
training in Greek and Latin literature and art which I 
received in German schools and universities. Indeed, 
if I were to single out the intellectual forces which more 
than any other have shaped my scholarly career, I 
should have no hesitation in saying that they were all 
drawn from Greece and Rome. 
Although the chief efforts of my career have been 
directed toward subjects lying outside of classical 
studies, I owe to classical studies whatever success these 
efforts may have had.

doing by knowing the best that has been thought and

largely practical than a real first hand knowledge of the 
ancient classics.

Far more of our larger and stronger high schools 
than is the case at present should offer liberal oppor- 
tunity for the study of Greek. The study of the Greek 
language and literature affords not only a training and 
culture of peculiar value, but it also leads to a richer and 
deeper understanding of many phases of modern art, 
literature and cultural thought. Many of the workers 
in the modern field have to be satisfied with studying 
Greek civilization through the medium of translations, 
but even at best this cannot compare with a study of 
the sources at first hand. 
H. K. Scum11ne 
Professor of German, University of California 
I have always insisted that a high school course which 
aims at a liberal education, not merely at vocational 
training, must include at least one of the ancient lan- 
guages. The term “general culture” still implies some 
first hand acquaintance with antiquity; and the best lin- 
guistic training is obtained by the study of both an an- 
cient and a modern language.

While I am not by any means an extreme advocate 
of the ancient classics, I could not be a teacher of his- 
tory without recognizing their fundamental importance 
to every student who would know at first hand the his- 
tory of European civilization or who aims at teaching 
or writing in the field of that history. Not only are 
the documents of that history, to this day, largely in 
Greek or in Latin, but during great periods, and in 
some quarters even to the present, these have been liv- 
ing tongues for communication between men and states; 
and so do they lie at the base of the thought, the liter- © 
atures, the institutions, even the personalities, that make 
up the history of the modern world, that without an 
acquaintance with one or both of these tongues one lacks 
an essential key to the significance of it all. Even if 
one’s study is narrowly to be confined to those modern 
lands and times whose vernaculars might rather seem 
fundamental, I believe that the best door to any schol- 
arly knowledge or use of these is through the older 
tongues which make intelligible not only their origin 
and growth, but furnish a clue as well to all that dialec- 
tic divergence with which the students of history must 
deal at every fresh step in time or place. 
With the study of history the study of language must 
always go pari passu; but scarcely less important to the 
student of history is that profound and constant influ- 
ence of the classical literature in the Middle Ages

scarcely less than at the Renaissance, and with small 
abatement throughout the modern centuries—which can 
only rightly be measured or understood by him who has 
studied those literatures for himself. 
So sensible are we at Cornell of the need of such a 
philological foundation-laying for work in history that 
we open to our freshmen few historical courses and ad- 
vise them in their earlier college years to choose lan- 
guages, if even at the cost of history.

I never touched a trained mind yet which had not

James Forp RHopEs

A writer of books, whether of poetry, romance or 
history, ought to know Latin well. The knowledge in- 
creases his acquaintance with English and facilitates his 
acquirement of French, Italian and Spanish. Latin 
and French are certainly indispensable to a liberal edu- 
cation. If the student has a linguistic turn of mind, he 
will compass Greek. He need not know Latin and 
Greek as thoroughly as a teacher knows them. Good 
translations abound, but it is a pleasure to read the 
great masters of literature in the original and to be able 
at need to criticise or approve the translators who have 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  316 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
extended the world’s acquaintance with the classical 
writers. 
The case is between Latin and Greek and the physi- 
cal and natural sciences. The man who loves literature 
should choose the ancient languages. Let no one select 
the sciences on account of ease. The generalizations are 
attractive but they are in reach of any reader. When 
it comes to higher mathematics or physical or chemical 
laboratory work, earnest and constant exertion is the 
key to success. More boys are inclined to literature 
than to science. Literature and language are allied; 
and the foundation is Latin and Greek. 
Cuaries H. Haskins

As a believer in the liberal education, I am of course 
interested in the maintenance of the classical ideal of 
culture and the studies which serve to support it; and as 
a professor of history, I can testify to the great advan- 
tage which students of sound classical training bring to 
their historical studies. As the field of human history 
lengthens, and the range of intellectual interests ex- 
tends, readjustment is inevitable in relation to the study 
of Greek and Latin and their place in courses of educa- 
tion, but in this process we have great need to prove all 
things and hold fast that which is good. 
Eruraim EMERTON 
Professor of Ecclesiastical History, Harvard University 
In reply to your request that I would write a brief 
statement as to the value of classical studies I beg to 
say that I regard them as an essential part of what I
-P-A-G-E-325
    STATEMENTS 817 
still venture to call a liberal education. By that phrase 
I mean an education free from the controlling purpose 
of making a living. That I understand to have been 
always the meaning of the artes liberales as distin- 
guished from professional studies, though this meaning 
has been grossly perverted in much of the modern dis- 
cussion on the subject. 
At the same time I am convinced that the present 
contempt of classical studies is very largely the fault of 
classical teachers themselves. They have been too prone 
to forget that no subject can have a humane effect in 
education unless it is taught humanely. The hope of a 
successful revival of interest in the classics depends, I 
think, almost wholly upon a recognition of this prin- 
ciple, and I rejoice to see some indications that it is 
being recognized and applied more widely ane more 
fruitfully than for some time past. 
As an academic person I have been waiting now for 
forty years, with an open mind, for the efficient substi- 
tutes for the classics and mathematics in the preparation 
of boys for the work of the college, but, if one may 
judge by results, these promised substitutes have not 
yet appeared.

The relative value in general education of voca-

here, but certainly the lack of those elements of culti-

the study of the classical literatures, is a serious defect 
in the education of any man.

Henry Oszsorn Taylor

So long as the most proper study of mankind is man, 
a knowledge of the classics must continue to form part 
of a humane education. For the last two thousand 
years, on through the decadence and “Christianization” 
of the Roman Empire, through the Carolingian period, 
through the Middle Ages, through the fifteenth and 
sixteenth centuries and the eighteenth likewise—they 
have been for each generation, according to its need and 
capacity, the eternal and elastic literary source of in- 
struction and enlightenment upon the nature and char- 
acter, the motives and the conduct of men. They afford 
a commentary upon the whole of human nature, and 
there is no substitute for them. They are also standards 
of excellence and beauty in human conduct and its liter- 
ary expression—and again there is no substitute for 
them. For their best effect, they should, of course, be 
taught and studied in their own Greek and Latin. But 
a knowledge of them through translations may educate, 
instruct and enlarge men’s minds, as Amyot’s transla- 
tion of Plutarch did in the sixteenth and following 
centuries.

I have had students of all courses in my classes in

found that those who came to the university with classi-

I do not hesitate, moreover, to state the opinion that, 
everything considered, the preparation afforded by the 
classical course in the high school is more valuable for 
the student, irrespective of the line of studies he is to 
pursue at the university, than any other course hitherto 
organized.

Latin formed the backbone of my course in prepara- 
tory school. At this stage of my education I found it 
profitable in three ways: It was a most excellent disci- 
pline; it gave much assistance in the study and use of 
English through insight into word formation and formal 
grammar; it gave a new enjoyment of literature. My 
undergraduate study of the same subject in college 
served as a necessary preparation for my subsequent 
work as teacher in the high school, as graduate student 
and as college instructor. The person who undertakes 
research work in ancient or medieval history can do 
practically nothing without it. The writers and the col- 
lege teachers of ancient history, today one of the most 
promising of all historical fields, must make a thorough 
knowledge of the ancient languages the foundation of 
their training. Medieval history, whether touched on

the political, the religious, the cultural or the institu-

use of Latin. Finally—what is of particular interest to 
me personally—the advanced study of the rise of the 
English Constitution and of the Common Law depends 
upon the same linguistic training. 
Hiram Bincuam

For any one who plans to work in South America, a

have found my former study of Latin to be of the great- 
est value in acquiring a working knowledge of the South 
American lingua franca. I believe most heartily in the 
importance of classical studies for those who would 
prove welcome visitors in Latin America. 
Daviv P. Barrows 
Director of Education in Philippine Islands, 1903-1909

I regard a thorough training in the classics as the 
best of all possible approaches to advanced studies in 
political science. The freshman who reads certain chap- 
ters in Thucydides, or the Agricola and Germania of 
Tacitus, is already making an excellent start in the 
science of politics and institutions. I have recently 
read with my young son certain books of Caesar, and, 
accompanying it, we have read Col. Dodge’s studies in 
Caesar’s campaigns, so I am at this moment in a re- 
newed way impressed with the value of Caesar as an

introduction both to military strategy and to the science 
of government in conquered territory. 
The English are, above all other peoples, a political 
nation, and as is well known their governing class has 
been trained in its habits of thought, its practical deal- 
ing with human nature and its large grasp of affairs by 
a system of instruction that is to a large degree a mas- 
tery of classical writers, and to which in a great measure 
must be attributed their political mastery and vision. 
Newton THORPE

The thorough study of the Latin language, in addi- 
tion to the help it gives in understanding the meaning 
of many words in our own tongue, habituates the mind 
to a degree of accuracy greatly desired in its every exer- 
cise. The Latin language affords a ready opportunity 
to test with approximate precision the interpretative 
powers of the mind, without the exercise of which no 
person can hope to be able to find himself or his sub- 
ject. Accuracy, precision, the power to distinguish 
similars from dissimilars, and dissimilars from similars, 
may be acquired by systematic practice only, and the 
Latin language affords one of the easiest agencies to- 
wards these results.

Acquaintance with some foreign language, with all 
that this implies in historical, sociological and psycho- 
logical outlook and insight, is an indispensable part of 
a modern liberal education. And I believe that Latin 
is for us the language best suited to serve this purpose. 
If our English speaking youth were able to study in 
school but one foreign language, it would be better, both 
for cultural and for utilitarian reasons, to choose Latin 
rather than any other. 
Rosert M. WENLEY

Ability to write decent Latin prose simply cannot be 
acquired without at the same time inducing the kind of 
mental organization which at length enables a man to 
go anywhere and do anything, as a great general 
phrased it. . . . And I draw the proof from my own ex- 
perience. The most effective masters of the “positive” 
sciences known to me personally are invariably men who 
have first acquired the mental organization which the 
culture studies confer; of this fact they are quite aware 
themselves. 
G. M. Strarron 
President American Psychological Association, 1908 
Professor of Psychology, University of California 
[On Mental Discipline] 
The mind is something far larger than the particular 
items which it observes and hears. It is a wonderful
-P-A-G-E-331
  STATEMENTS 823 
organism, with powers latent, powers developed, powers 
lost through disuse. Any schooling seems to me a fail- 
ure that overlooks this, and regards the mind as a mere 
assembly of interesting ideas and of useful items of in- 
formation. Education must train a person to will aright 
and to work, and to withstand inner and outer distrac- 
tions, as well as to act not only with a sympathy for 
human beings near at hand but also with sympathy and 
with understanding of distant peoples and distant times. 
The findings of psychology all favor this richer concep- 
tion of the human person, and it would be a grave mis- 
take to suppose that the experimental work has proved 
that the idea of mental discipline is no longer tenable. 
Lawrence Cote 
Director of the School of Social and Home Service 
Professor of Psychology, University of Colorado 
It is my duty to teach the elements of psychology to 
large classes of sophomores in college. Despite many 
simple experiments and the newer methods of instruc- 
tion, the subject is still somewhat abstract. I cannot 
transfix the mind on a dissecting needle and pass it 
around for inspection as one might a cockroach or a 
butterfly. Consequently, students find that the subject 
does not disclose its secrets without considerable study. 
The difficulty, as far as I can define it, lies in this. Be- 
sides learning to see objects, the student must learn to 
make nice but definite discriminations, must form cer- 
tain general notions, and must, above all things, learn to 
detect relations. Now analysis, generalization and re- 
lational thinking are developed and trained above all 
things else by the student of Latin and Greek. For 
this reason, your classicist is always an educated man.

A. G. KELLER 
Co-editor of the Yale Review

It is not enough to have only one strongly discipli- 
nary elementary study. Perhaps three were too many, 
but two are not. The student whe knows the Latin 
grammar, who has carefully read the required texts 
and who can render simple English into Latin has been 
under mental discipline for which the present writer, 
for one, sees no effective substitute. Greek would be 
as good and perhaps better for the purpose; but now it 
is Latin or one of those substitutes that are easy and’ 
interesting. So long as Latin holds this unique position 
in the sphere of elementary education it can be sure of 
retaining the support of those who want the young to 
encounter a steady and solid resistance and to overcome 
it, at least in some measure, by straining the powers and 
so strengthening them. 
A person who feels this way about the case of Latin 
does not particularly care whether or not those for whom 
he is responsible, to the extent of his power and influ- 
ence, come later to blame him for permitting them to 
waste their time on Latin for no evident result. A good 
many of us could not possibly solve a quadratic equa- 
tion that was anything more than baldly unadorned; 
but we are glad we applied ourselves to algebra. For

the values of application come from the study and not 
from the results alone; hence they are culled uncon- 
sciously all the time, even though the final result upon 
which the eye is continually fixed seems insubstantial. 
The reason why so many parents want their children to 
study Latin is, whether they render count to them- 
selves of their motives or not, because it is hard. 
To get, then, at the cultural value of Latin literature 
in the original, the price, if that means the actual learn- 
ing of the Latin language, is too great. Several, also, 
of the asserted practical utilities of acquaintance with 
Latin will not stand examination as being worth the 
cost. But, apart from such results, amidst a welter of, 
whimsical, easy, or merely interesting and playful sub- 
jects, Latin stands alone with mathematics. The two 
are not interchangeable, as were, virtually, in this re- 
spect, Greek and Latin. There is no substitute in sight 
for either one. Hence both, and in particular Latin, 
whose case we have been considering, should be sustained 
pending the rise of a substitute of equal or superior dis- 
ciplinary value along similar lines. In this role of a 
disciplinary study Latin shows itself worth the cost.

Is it not a strange reflection upon our civilization that 
in this twentieth century, when the world knows more 
than it ever knew before, and ought to be so much the 
wiser, we should be called upon to defend the study of 
the classics—the very study which five centuries ago let 
daylight into the minds of men, and prepared the way 
for the development of human intelligence which has 
been in progress ever since? Until the present gener- 
ation the value of a familiarity with Greek and Roman 
thought, as expressed in their literature, their history 
and their art remained practically unchallenged as an 
essential factor in a college curriculum. Are we now 
 
-P-A-G-E-335
  
STATEMENTS 827 
to assume that this long experience was all a mistake, or 
must we agree that the influence of these studies, how- 
ever beneficial to our forefathers, has now played its 
part and must give place to something of a more prac- 
tical nature? 
We must admit that this is an age of facts. The 
names which will be handed down to posterity as repre- 
senting the greatness of our time are those of scientists, 
inventors, discoverers, men who have added new facts to 
the knowledge of the world rather than those who have 
broadened its field of imagination in literature and the 
arts. Yielding to this spirit, believing that the practi- 
cal is now the chief, if not the sole, aim of the higher as 
well as the lower education, some even among our more 
eminent educators make that the one test, and in it the 
classics are found wanting; therefore they must go. 
It is well that the study of the classics should be put 
to the test under present conditions, because they give 
to those who believe in it the opportunity to show 
whether that belief is founded upon anything more sub- 
stantial than tradition, and whether the accumulation of 
facts alone constitutes an education in the high sense in 
which we wish to see it regarded in America. 
For my own part, I have no doubt of the result, if the 
question can be decided upon its own merits, as it cer- 
tainly will be in the long run, and I look upon the pres- 
ent movement against classical studies as an attempt to 
hold back the tide which will surely sweep away such 
obstacles and resume its old course. I cannot think that 
this opposition will have any lasting effect, because 
there are too many men and women who feel as I do 
that a knowledge of Greece, and what she not only has 
done but still continues to do for the world, is an essen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  828 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
tial part of every cultivated man’s equipment, and that 
this knowledge should be gained at first hand through 
what she has left us, namely, her language, her litera- 
ture and her art. Next to the history of his own coun- 
try there is none so stimulating to an American youth 
as that of Greece, with its high ideals, its struggles to 
introduce popular government into the world, and the 
warnings of its later stages, when the ideals had been 
lost. Her poets and philosophers have shown us, as 
have none others since, the flights of which the human 
mind is capable; and in her arts she has provided us with 
standards and principles of beauty which have been 
neither equalled nor supplanted by any other nation. 
The flame burned but a short while, yet its light has il- 
lumined the world wherever it reached, and it would be 
an undying reproach if we were to allow it to be ex- 
tinguished or dimmed in our time. 
ARTHUR FAIRBANKS

To my mind the fundamental reason for emphasis on 
classical studies in education is not their general discip- 
linary value, not their practical value for students of 
modern languages including English, not the literature 
they open to the student, not the facts that these sub- 
jects are perhaps better taught than others in our sec- 
ondary schools, important and far-reaching as these 
considerations are. The fundamental reason, I believe, 
is that Greek and in a different way Latin are such 
perfect means for the expression of man’s thought. 
Inevitably though often unconsciously the study of lan- 
guage is the study of the human mind through its best 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
    STATEMENTS 829 
means of expression. We need in education today, 
along with our study of things, the study of mind and 
that through language. This purpose, so far as I can 
see, is not fulfilled by the study of modern languages in 
at all the same degree as by the study of Latin and 
Greek, nor can we expect that it should be. Accord- 
ingly I believe that classical studies should have a larger 
place in our educational system than they hold today. 
R. Curpston Sturcis 
Chairman of Committee on Education, American Institute of Architects

Mr. Mauran has asked me to write a brief statement 
about the value of the classical studies in general, and 
perhaps more particularly for those who are to practice 
the profession of architecture. Quite apart from the 
fact that Greece and Rome have made such a funda- 
mental contribution to architecture in the development 
of the orders, a knowledge of the history and culture 
and civilization of Greece and Rome is of vital im- 
portance for every educated man. If however one looks 
back on one’s own study of the classics in school and 
college, one feels that instead of getting an insight into 
the spirit of the times one was simply bored, and both- 
ered with needless details of grammar. If the acquisi- 
tion of a classical language necessitates that kind of 
training then, in my judgment, it would be better to 
study the classical periods in English, and through good 
translations. I believe a more sympathetic understand- 
ing of the art of Greece would be developed from read- 
ing Murray’s translations of Euripides than by the 
study of Greek grammar. I believe that if a real in- 
terest were aroused in a student through good lectures,
-P-A-G-E-338
  330 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
well illustrated, on architecture and sculpture of Greece, 
and if the student were familiar with her literature, 
he would be stimulated to follow his study further by 
acquiring a knowledge of the original tongue used by 
the men who produced these masterpieces of literature 
and art. 
I therefore heartily believe in the study of the class- 
ics, but I believe these studies should be so conducted as 
to chain the interest and attention of every student. In 
my judgment no student will carry away anything of 
vital importance to him in his life from any study, un- 
less, through keen interest in the subject, his mind is 
absolutely fixed upon it. 
The study of the classics would then begin by giving 
the child some knowledge of the vital history of Greece 
and Rome, emphasizing rather the arts than wars and 
conquests. This should be followed by some study of 
the literature of Greece and Rome, and if these studies 
awakened a real interest and desire to go further and 
know the beauties of the Greek and Latin tongues, then, 
and not until then, should the student be given oppor- 
tunity to study in the original.

It is difficult to put in a few words my sense of our 
indebtedness to Greece and Rome. The greater part 
of all that is beautiful in modern civilization may be 
traced to classic sources. This is true not only of the 
arts of design, but of philosophy, literature, and to a 
lesser, but still notable degree, of science.

It is obvious that for an archaeologist a knowledge of 
the classic languages is indispensable. Otherwise how 
could he decipher inscriptions, read documents, and in- 
terpret the grand series of monuments that remain to 
us from classic, mediaeval and Renaissance times? And 
what is true for the archaeologist is true also for the 
toilers in many other fields of learning, and for every 
liberally educated man as well. 
One nation in recent years has endeavored to efface 
from its language and its life all traces of classic influ- 
ence. As a consequence it has eliminated delicacy, 
grace, beauty of form and color, and has set in its place 
a coarse, inhuman, brutal, monstrous Kultur. ‘ 
Frank JEwetr Maruer, Jr.

My college study of the Greek and Latin classics has 
given me permanent standards by which I may weigh 
the pleasures of literature. The smattering of Greek 
which I still keep gives me hope of resuming delightful 
studies in the leisure of old age. 
Latin has remained a chief utility to me. It has 
widely opened the doors of history. All the greatest 
products of the human mind from the dawn of the 
Christian era to the Renaissance are set down not in the 
vernacular tongue but in Latin. I owe to my college 
training that I can and do read the great works of the 
Middle Ages in the sonorous Latin of the Christian 
fathers, in the Franciscan books of devotion, in chroni- 
cles and charters, in the songs of the vagrant students, 
in the pungent satires of the humanist reformers. Any 
literary culture I may have acquired has been largely
-P-A-G-E-340
  332 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
due to such reading. Through my knowledge of Latin 
the splendor of the Middle Ages has become alive to 
me. It is the only road to that vision. 
Latin has also been a permanent utility in another 
way. With it as a background I have readily learned 
other tongues. I cannot remember when I learned 
Italian and Spanish. I simply read them when I 
needed them. Latin is the key to the modern languages. 
The question of Greek and Latin is simply whether 
the past of culture has value for us or not. If one 
honestly believes that most of the best thinking and 
beautiful writing dates from after the discovery of 
America, then the classics are sheer luxuries like Old 
Norse or Finnish. I prefer to think that it is better to 
read Plato than to read Herbert Spencer, and that no 
education is real, from the point of view of history and 
humanism, which leaves the classics out. 
J. G. Howarp

I consider Latin one of the most fruitful subjects of 
study to which I have ever given attention, in spite of 
the fact that I had only a preparatory school training 
in it, at the Boston Latin School, and was not very 
much of a scholar at it even so, I fear. It has always 
been a source of great refreshment and interest. It 
forms a basis of keen enjoyment of literature of all 
sorts, technical and otherwise. It enlarges the vision 
and enriches the sympathies. While it may not be im- 
mediately and demonstrably contributive to an archi- 
tect’s education in a practical way, yet I feel that an 
architect is immensely benefited by having passed 
through a good stiff training in Latin, and I always

Without intelligent knowledge of the past, as it has 
shown itself in its religion, its philosophy, its social or- 
ganization and its art, it is impossible to interpret his- 
tory, to comprehend the present or to determine the 
future. The socalled “cultural” studies, emancipated 
from psychology and philology, and dealt with as liv- 
ing forces, not as phenomena of biological determinism, 
are the only basis for this constructive knowledge. Of 
them all Greek and Latin, taught as vital and enduring 
realities, not as “kitchen-middens” for the experimental 
delving of the philological antiquarian, are of the great- 
est excellence. 
They are the languages of the great epochs of vital 
civilization, Hellenic, Roman, Mediaeval, and through 
them alone we come to the heart of the true culture that 
stands as an eternal reproach to our own barbarism. 
Each has, in itself and as a language, something of the 
quality of the great past, lost beyond recovery in trans- 
lation. They are the shrine wherein is preserved the 
enduring glory of man, and if you cast away the shrine 
the jewel is lost. For them there is no substitute, be- 
yond them no equal revelation of eternal values. They 
are the old lamps we have sold for the new of unscrupu-
-P-A-G-E-342

lous traffickers in Brumagem trinkets. Through Greek 
and Latin, and through them only, can we come into 
actual personal contact with that great past which is 
the only sound basis of enduring culture and righteous 
civilization. We have tried to cut ourselves off from 
history, to deny the sufficiency of long established moral 
and intellectual and aesthetic values, to lift ourselves 
by the boot-straps of modernism; and our attempted 
rejection of cultural education, and of the eternal lan- 
guages of eternal things, is the adequate symbol of our 
folly. The present estate of the world is a sufficient 
commentary. 
Speaking as a follower of one of the arts, I can only 
say that Greek and Latin, as languages, are of the esse 
of the art which was the recording of the crowning civi- 
lizations—Hellenic, Roman and Mediaeval—of which 
they themselves were the voicing. If the “artist” of 
today knew the arts of these culminating eras, and the 
quality of their culture through the languages them- 
selves, there might be less bad art and less world war- 
fare and a more creditable contemporary civilization.

It is altogether because Greek and Latin have 
been retained in the curriculum that rare scholars have 
risen from the mass and been given opportunity to in- 
terpret the classics and make, however inadequately, 
the application to modern life; and as life is ever chang- 
ing it would seem natural that new interpretations and 
applications should from time to time be necessary and 
desirable; and this, I feel, can come only through a    
   
    
  
-P-A-G-E-343
  STATEMENTS 835 
knowledge of the languages gained primarily in the 
schools and a knowledge of life gained primarily 
through experience. 
As to the value of the classics, take just one phase: 
There can be no real understanding of our own art 
today unless we understand the art of the races which 
bequeathed their heritage to us; and until we compre- 
hend the character and value of the heritage we cannot 
realize the extent to which we have squandered and 
dissipated it or left it unemployed, and, comprehending, 
bring ourselves to a determination to conserve the gift. 
Now art is a visible symbol of life and that we may 
not only behold the symbol but recognize its validity 
we need both an interpretation of the form and an un- 
derstanding of the philosophy, the religion, the ethics, 
indeed, of all the factors of the life underlying the form. 
All this may best be gained by drinking at the foun- 
tain head of expression in the original. If the classics 
are so taught that the thought and the life which the 
language clothes are to be of paramount interest, rather 
than grammar and syntax, then the classics hold a high 
place in the curricula of the schools. If they are to be 
character moulders, rather than developers of vocaliz- 
ing automata, the classics have a function in a live sys- 
tem of education today—and the times call for no other 
system. The times call for powers of thought, and 
thought is reaction to experience. 
Greek and Latin are the embodiment of thoughts 
which represent experience; the experience being the 
vital thing. The language must be familiar to one who 
would best comprehend not only the thought but the 
delicacy and refinement of expression, and it is in that 
light that the language must be studied. Is it asking
-P-A-G-E-344
  336 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
too much that the teacher be able to expound the main- 
springs of the thought as well as describe and hear reci- 
tations upon the technical forms in which the thought 
is embodied? Perhaps that condition which impels the 
calling of a conference on classical studies, and for an 
expression of opinion from men in non-academic life, 
arises not so much from the obsolescence of the classics 
as from a lack of comprehension on the part of curricu- 
lum builders and teachers as to the real relation existing 
between Greek and Latin thought and the thought of 
today. It might be of interest to pupils in schools to- 
‘day to know and be able to see at first hand how Greek 
idealism has affected our life and thought for the better 
and how Rome has impressed the form rather than the 
true spirit on our art and institutions. And where bet- 
ter can the initiative be taken than in the schools? Clas- 
sical studies are not to be eliminated from the school 
curricula but are to be vitalized and made to bear di- 
rectly upon the life and thought of our own age, and 
upon character development, for which life and the 
ability to think are given us.

for the peculiar discipline of the mind that it engenders 
but for the very fact that it may serve no more definite 
educational purpose than that of general culture. To 
train the youth to think that nothing is worth his while 
to study but that in which he can see a definite return in 
dollars and cents would tend to create a mercenary point

I can’t imagine anyone being entirely contented with- 
out some acquaintance with some of the classical people. 
They were such very good society! If Dante and 
Shakespeare and Milton got such a lot of comfort out 
of them, might not we find some really solid, even “prac- 
tical,” advantage in their company? Surely they are 
stimulating. If elegance, force and terseness are desir- 
able qualities, surely we may find them in their written 
words, and if visible beauty is worth while, where may 
you find it more perfect (or more perfectly pedestalled) 
than on the rock of the Athenian Acropolis? If we 
care about getting at the roots of almost anything, we 
must care about the antique people; for if you dig a 
little anywhere in Europe west of the Rhine or south 
of the Danube, you come upon them. 
Everybody wants to be “practical” nowadays. But

if you cannot break the continuity of literature or of

advantage ignore continuity?

Experience of many years in college life at Yale has

profitable in music as in any other work. 
There is no question in my mind of the usefulness of 
classical studies, nor even of their essential character in 
the liberal education without which a creative musician 
of power can never do his work thoroughly well. 
14. ORIENTAL STUDIES 
STATEMENT FROM Lorp ReEpEsDALE’s MeEmorrs 
Vol. I, page 93 
The best Oriental scholars whom I have known have 
all been men who attacked their Eastern studies armed 
with the weapons furnished by a classical education. In 
China Sir Harry Parkes was an admirable oral inter- 
preter. But he, himself, as I have said elsewhere, al- 
ways regretted his want of classical training—nor 
would it be possible to compare him with that great 
scholar, Sir Thomas Wade. In Japan Von Siebold was 
as fluent a talker as could be found. He was the son 
of the famous physician and naturalist, who was at- 
tached to the Dutch Mission at Deshima, and had learnt 
Japanese ambulando. But it would be childish to 
  
-P-A-G-E-347
    STATEMENTS 889 
name him with such learned men as Satow, Aston and 
Chamberlain, men who brought the training and liter- 
ature of the West to their studies in the East. It is not 
without significance to note the great respect which 
such men were able to command, whereas the mere par- 
rot, however clever, was held in little more esteem than 
a head waiter. Think of Basil Chamberlain appointed 
to the Chair of ancient Japanese literature in the Uni- 
versity of Tokio. 
And our own beautiful English, the language of 
Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton: will that not suffer if a 
false utilitarianism should succeed in banishing the 
classics from our schools? 
Mavrict BLooMFIELD 
Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology 
Johns Hopkins University 
I believe firmly that the classics are the most essen- 
tial factor in a liberal education. 
I am almost stunned by one factor of the modern edu- 
cational theory, namely, its failure to furnish common 
ground for educated men to meet upon. About forty 
years ago it seemed as though natural science, that is to 
say, its intellectual and imaginative outcomes, might 
furnish a substitute for the common property shared in 
the classics by all educated men. It was the day after 
Darwin, the day of Tyndall, Huxley, Buechner, Wal- 
lace and others. But the riddle of the cosmos proved 
too intricate. The facile appeal of evolution has been 
modified, if not replaced, by more austere theories which 
are scarcely intelligible to the layman. ‘The various 
modern literatures are segregative and brew chauvin- 
ism. The classics alone are the common priceless pos-

session of the Western world, and a really communal 
liberal education without them is very hard to imagine. 
I forgot to mention the social sciences are too unstable 
for the purpose mentioned; they follow after historical 
events of all sorts, and are under the domination of 
tangled circumstances and the will of individuals. 
Hence the rise and fall of such economic interests as the 
tariff question which seemed at one time to bind to- 
gether the intellects of all men. 
I am not fitted by my occupation to make a really 
substantial plea for the classics. This letter, as well as 
my printed utterances, are impressionist and nothing 
more. I mean them both, at any rate, to convey my 
settled conviction that a really liberal education with- 
out the classics is not to be imagined. 
Rvupotren EK. Brurnnow 
Late Professor of Semitic Philology, Princeton University 
I am most decidedly of the opinion that an intimate 
knowledge of the history, literature and political insti- 
tutions of ancient Greece and Rome forms the essential 
basis for the correct understanding of the intellectual, 
political, and social development of the later European 
nations down to the present time, and that it should 
therefore, be required of every one who aspires to play 
a part in that development, or to exercise functions 
whose roots still derive a large part of their nourish- 
ment from Hellenic and Italic soil. 
| It is idle to assert that the study of the natural 
sciences can take the place of the classical languages. 
For those studies have reference only to the objects of 
the outer world, not to the intellect itself, and are only 
then really educative in the sense of giving an intellect-
-P-A-G-E-349
  
STATEMENTS 341 
ual training when they involve mathematics, as in the 
science of physics. The acquisition of the mere facts 
of natural science has no educative value whatever by 
itself, but only as a basis for the exercise of the general- 
izing faculty, and this faculty is best developed when 
the intellectual relations are brought to their highest 
point by means of the study of their best means of ex- 
pression. 
To conclude, I should consider it almost a crime to 
deprive future generations of the opportunity of de- 
veloping their intellectual faculties on the broadest basis 
by debarring them from the use of the most powerful 
engine that has ever been devised for the attainment of 
that end. 
Morris J astrow, JR. 
Professor of Semitic Languages, University of Pennsylvania 
I am a believer in modernizing our system of educa- 
tion so as to cope with present conditions of life, but I 
also believe no less strongly in the desirability of en- 
couraging in every possible way the study of the 
classics. ‘The two ideas are not incompatible, though 
this appears to be an opinion commonly held. Educa- 
tional methods are subject to constant change and it is 
right that they should be, for every age ought to de- 
velop its own system. This applies particularly to a 
period like the present, dominated to so large an extent 
by discoveries of a far-reaching character in the domain 
of the natural sciences and which have so largely affected 
modern thought, our attitude towards things in general 
and our standards and method of life. I believe that in 
accordance with these changed conditions, education, 
particularly of the very young, should concern itself
-P-A-G-E-350
  842 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
very largely with developing knowledge of nature 
through observation and experiment and should also 
seek to introduce the young, through manual training 
and other means, to an appreciation of the practical 
sides of life, to an understanding of the industrial arts 
which play such a large part in modern economy—in 
short to lay emphasis on the necessity of obtaining 
knowledge that is primarily useful. 
At the same time there are other aspects of modern 
life which need to be understood and which do not— 
primarily at least—fall within the category of the use- 
ful and practical. I have not in mind now what is con- 
ventionally known as the training of the mind. That 
undoubtedly can be accomplished through any subject 
which is studied intensively and which demands an ex- 
ercise of one’s mental faculties. The aim of the cultural 
subjects is, as I take it, to enlarge one’s vision, to make 
one appreciate the forces underlying civilization, to 
give one a taste for good reading, for music, for art, 
aye, for philosophy, for an understanding of the funda- 
mental problems of the universe with which man has 
grappled ever since he began to think, and without 
which one may become a religious automaton, but never 
reach out to what religion really is and what part it has 
played in the world’s history. Now, the value of the 
study of the classics among the cultural subjects rests, 
if I mistake not, ultimately on the dependence of mod- 
ern culture upon the standards and ideals developed in 
ancient Greece and Rome. I do not mean, of course, to 
assert that Latin and Greek are the only foundations of 
modern civilization, but certainly they constitute most 
important stones in that foundation. It is not impos- 
sible, though almost impossible and certainly very diffi-
-P-A-G-E-351
STATEMENTS 843 
cult, to get an appreciation of Greek and Roman civi- 
lization without some knowledge at least of Latin and 
Greek. The language of a people not only reveals its 
genius, but is, as a matter of fact, an expression of the 
intellectual life of the people. A knowledge of the 
language is, therefore, the most direct method of ap- 
proach toward an understanding of any particular 
civilization which has left literary remains. It means 
going directly to the source for a grasp of Greek and 
Roman ideas, of Greek and Roman modes of thought, 
of Greek and Roman contributions to the intellectual, 
political, social, philosophical and religious treasury of 
mankind; and I hold that even “a little Latin and less 
Greek” is a better approach than if we depend entirely 
upon translation as a medium. As the late Dr. Furness 
said, in a farewell address to the students at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, “If you cannot drink deep out 
of the Pierian spring, in heaven’s name, take a sip.” 
It is manifestly impossible, for reasons that it will be 
superfluous to set forth, for any large proportion of 
those who study some Latin and a little Greek to be- 
come proficient in these languages. We should neither 
expect the impossible, nor is it desirable even to strive 
for it. The purpose of a high school or a collegiate edu- 
cation is not to develop a specialist in any field, but to 
produce an all-round man or woman, prepared to take 
up that special province which each one selects (or has 
selected for him) as his life’s work. 
As for those who wish to take up scholarly pursuits, 
no matter in what field, a knowledge of Latin and 
Greek is of such invaluable and direct aid that it may 
properly be called indispensable. Unless one can ac- 
quire the scholarly attitude, one can never be a scholar
-P-A-G-E-352
  844 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
in the real sense. Whether it be in the field of litera- 
ture, mathematics, archaeology, philology, medicine, 
law, or even any of the natural sciences, or engineering 
or mechanics, provided one has the ambition to pass be- 
yond merely practical application, the direct approach 
toward the two great civilizations of the past, of which 
Europe and America are the direct heirs, is more cer- 
tain of creating the indispensable scholarly attitude 
than anything else that has so far been tried. That di- 
rect approach is the study of some Latin and some 
Greek—and by “some” I mean as much as one can get. 
A substitute “something just as good” may some day 
be found, but the discoverer has not yet appeared on the 
horizon. It was, I believe, Sydney Smith who made the 
oft quoted remark that the Lord might have created a 
more luscious fruit than the strawberry, but it is certain 
that He never did. 
If one believes that a thoroughly modern system of 
education needs to be supplemented by due considera- 
tion for purely cultural subjects, I do not see how one 
can escape the conclusion that the direct approach 
through the study of the classics is an essential factor in 
the endeavor to produce what, for want of a better term, 
we may designate “an all-round” man or woman. Let 
me emphasize once more that in this statement I have 
not in mind the scholar, for whom, as I have tried to 
point out, Latin and Greek is so valuable an adjunct in 
creating in the individual the scholarly attitude as to 
justify one in saying that it is indispensable. My plea 
is for the man or woman of general culture, and I am 
not urging proficiency as the goal for this large class, 
but only some Latin and, if you choose, not as much 
Greek, merely because the study of these languages is
-P-A-G-E-353
  STATEMENTS 845 
the direct and, as I venture to think, for this reason also 
the easiest approach toward an understanding of an 
important section of mankind’s history and achieve- 
ments which directly concern us of the present day. 
BRITISH AND FRENCH STATEMENTS 
JOINT STATEMENT OF VISCOUNT BRYCE AND OTHERS 
First published in the London Times, May 4, 1916 
Under the shock and stress of the war the aims and 
methods of education have to be considered anew. This 
reconsideration, in the special conditions of the time, 
brings with it a risk that we may ignore elements in 
education vital in the formation and maintenance of 
national character. A great war, in which material 
means and technical skill are the most obvious factors 
in deciding the issue, inclines a nation to prize these to 
the exclusion of forces finally even more important; and 
if in our reforms we fix our eyes only on material ends 
we may foster ourselves that very spirit against which 
we are fighting today. 
At a time when the energies of the nation are neces- 
sarily concentrated on other matters sweeping changes 
are proposed without their effects being thought out. 
It is of the utmost importance that our higher education 
should not become materialistic through too narrow a 
regard for practical efficiency. Technical knowledge is 
essential to our industrial prosperity and national safe- 
ty; but education should be nothing less than a prepa- 
ration for the whole of life. It should introduce the 
future citizens of the community not merely to the 
physical structure of the world in which they live but 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  346 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
also to the deeper interests and problems of politics, 
thought and human life. It should acquaint them, so 
far as may be, with the capacities and ideals of man- 
kind as expressed in literature and in art, with its am- 
bitions and achievements as recorded in history and 
with the nature and laws of the world as interpreted by 
science, philosophy and religion. If we neglect physi- 
cal science we shall have a very imperfect knowledge of 
the world around us; but if we ignore or subordinate 
the other elements of knowledge, we shall cut ourselves 
off from aspects of life of even greater importance. 
Even physical science will suffer. Some of its most 
distinguished representatives have strongly insisted that 
early specialization is injurious to the interests they have 
at heart and that the best preparation for scientific pur- 
suits is a general training which includes some study of 
language, literature and history. Such a training gives 
width of view and flexibility of intellect. Industry and 
commerce will be most successfully pursued by men 
whose education has stimulated their imagination and 
widened their sympathies. 
It is our conviction that the nation requires scientific 
method and a belief in knowledge, even more than physi- 
cal science, and that the former is by no means identi- 
cal with the latter. We might enthrone physical science 
in all our schools without acquiring as a nation what we 
most need, the persuasion that knowledge is essential 
to success and that this knowledge means facts labori- 
ously gathered, wisely selected and carefully tested. 
This scientific method is not the peculiar property of 
physical science; all good work in all studies is based 
upon it, it is indispensable to law, history, classics, poli- 
tics and all branches of knowledge rightly understood.  
-P-A-G-E-355
    STATEMENTS 847 
What we want is scientific method in all the branches 
of an education which will develop human faculty to 
the highest possible degree. 
In this education we believe that the study of Greece 
and Rome must always have a large part, because our 
whole civilization is rooted in the history of these peo- 
ples, and without knowledge of them cannot be properly 
understood. The small city communities of Greece 
created the intellectual life of Europe. In their liter- 
ature we find models of thought and expression and 
meet the subtle and powerful personalities who origi- 
nated for Europe all forms of poetry, history and phil- 
osophy, and even physical science itself, no less than 
the ideal of freedom and the conception of a self-govern- 
ing democracy; while the student is introduced to the 
great problems of thought and life at their springs be- 
fore he follows them through the wider but more con- 
fused currents of the modern world. Nor can it be 
right that the educated citizens of a great empire should 
remain ignorant of the first state that met the problem 
of uniting in a contented and prosperous common- 
wealth nations differing in race, temper and culture, 
and which has left so deep a mark on the language, law 
and political conceptions of Europe. Some knowledge 
of Latin is indispensable for the intelligent study of any 
one of these things, and even for the intelligent use of 
our own language. Greece and Rome afford us unique 
instances, the one of creative and critical intelligence, 
the other of constructive statesmanship. Nor can we 
afford to neglect the noble precepts and shining ex- 
amples of patriotism with which their history abounds. 
In urging this we do not commit ourselves to defend- 
ing the present system of classical education in all its 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  348 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
details. Still less do we claim for it any artificial privi- 
lege. We cordially sympathize with the desire to 
strengthen the teaching of modern history, of modern 
languages and of the literature of our own country. 
Further, we fully accept the importance of promoting 
scientific research, of extending scientific instruction in 
schools where it is still inadequately provided and of 
improving the quality of science teaching; and we de- 
sire to cooperate with the representatives of these studies 
in ensuring them a due place in our national education. 
At the same time we would point out that much criti- 
cism of our schools seems directed against a past state 
of things, and ignores reforms which have been already 
effected. It is sometimes forgotten that the teaching 
of physical science is compulsory in all State aided 
secondary schools, that of Latin, and of course of Greek, 
in none.

Maniresto oF THE FrencH AcADEMY 
Manifesto, signed May 18, 1911, by all the members 
of the French Academy present at the session of that 
date: 
“At a time when on all sides and in all domains the 
consciousness of French traditions is apparently weak- 
ening a revival of the national ideal is more than ever 
necessary. 
“Whatever we do, our origins, our language, our 
spirit render us accessory to a past which extends from 
the earliest epochs of our history down to our own age. 
“This truth is systematically forgotten when we lay 
ourselves liable to discrediting classical culture and the 
humanities, the sap which permeates deeply our medi- 
terranean civilization and which has not yet brought to 
bloom all its flowers. The genius of our race owes it to 
itself to preserve and cause to wax this creative force, 
to disseminate it abundantly in the world. But this is 
possible only on condition that it is drawn up always 
into the very roots of our civilizaton. 
“There is no lack of harmony between scientific train- 
ing and the humanities, which, far from constituting a 
useless school of elegance, form the best exercise and 
the surest discipline of the mind. 
“There is no longer any antagonism between the hu- 
manities and modern society, which, to escape turning to 
demagogism, requires an intellectual élite. The richest 
source of this élite is in the people, if only the means can 
be found of rendering the humanities accessible. 
“Thus it is that, quite apart from a spirit of partisan- 
ship, men can rally to the standard of the humanities. 
“It is important to collect all scattered forces; the

STATEMENT oF M. SarrautT 
Minister of Public Instruction 
In February, 1915, M. Albert Sarraut, Minister of 
Public Instruction, refusing to accept a proposal look- 
ing toward a certain modification of the requirements 
for the admission to higher scientific studies in the 
French universities, wrote: 
“Tt seems to me that if this modification in the actual 
regulations were accepted those having in view medical 
studies would find it still more easy than at present to 
obtain remission of the bachelor’s degree. . . . 
“T regard the bachelor’s degree as in practice furnish- 
ing the necessary guarantee of the classical study which 
makes it possible to follow with real profit the courses 
of the universities. . . . I do not think that I ought to 
extend facilities which have the drawback of damaging 
that classical culture the high educational worth of which 
present circumstances cause us still more clearly to 
understand.”

852 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
  Oprnion or Leapine FrENcH [RONMASTERS 
Extract from letter of President Guillain in behalf of the Comité des 
Forges (French Forges and Furnaces), and addressed to the Minister of 
Public Instruction in 1911. 
After having affirmed that young engineers are for 
the most part incapable of expressing their ideas in clear 
and well composed reports the letter continues: “This 
incapacity has not only the effect of diminishing the 
value and the serviceable production of our co-workers, 
it has, furthermore, the great inconvenience of dimin- 
ishing to an extraordinary degree the number of men 
whom the keenness and the breadth of their intelligence, 
the accuracy and depth of their judgment fit to direct 
great businesses, to produce new ones and to maintain 
France in the place which in spite of her lack of natural 
resources her clear genius has been able to assure her 
in the van of progress in the industrial arts and sciences. 
“It appears to us . . . that this decay in the general 
culture of our youth must find its cause not only in the 
different reforms of secondary education which we have 
seen introduced during a number of years and which 
have found their complete expression in the courses of 
study of 1902 but also in the spirit which animates to- 
day all university education, and which, to increase the 
number of subjects put within the reach of our youth, 
dispenses more and more with the painful but fruitful 
discipline resultant from personal effort. At this very 
time, if modern education is not giving us that which 
had been promised to us, young people well equipped 
for life and thoroughly versed in foreign languages, 
what has been left of classical instruction no longer 
guarantees to the great schools, charged with the train- 
ing of the future captains of national industry, material

copiously and forcefully enough cultivated to receive 
properly the higher training which these institutions 
bestow. 
“. . . We permit ourselves to call to your attention 
the necessity of recasting the scheme of secondary edu- 
cation, and the danger of all measures . . . which tend 
by a set of unjustified equivalents to cause secondary 
education in the classics to lose the preeminent place 
that it ought to occupy in the training of young people 
who are designed to recruit our great schools.” 
Nore: As was pointed out by the Minister of Public 
Instruction in his reply to this communication, and by 
M. Lanson in the Revue Bleue, (December 24, 1911), 
the defects in the mental equipment of young engineers, 
of which the Comité des Forges complained, could not be 
entirely attributed to the reform scheme of 1902, since 
this had not been in force long enough to permit accu- 
rate estimate of its effects. Nevertheless, the letter is 
a significant expression of what, in the opinion of the 
foremost technical men of France, study of the classics 
is better able than rival disciplines to contribute to 
practical education.

Berthelot, the illustrious chemist, was asked how he

he replied. . . . It was from the Greeks that Henri 
Poincaré, the mathematical genius, gained the secret of 
his daring achievements in mathematics; . . . one of his 
last works was an eloquent plea for the humanities.

STATISTICS 
In connection with the Princeton Conference on 
Classical Studies in Liberal Education a pamphlet was 
issued, intended at first merely for distribution among 
those in attendance upon the Conference itself, in which 
brief answers, in statistical form, were given to two 
questions which are frequently raised in current discus- 
sions of the educational issues involved. ‘These ques- 
tions are: Is Latin dying out in the schools? and How 
do classical students in school and college succeed in 
meeting the various intellectual tests in which they are 
brought into competition with the non-classical students? 
This pamphlet has aroused such widespread interest 
throughout the country that it has been thought worth 
while to reproduce the statistics with large additions as 
the final chapter of the present volume. The material, 
which was presented in the pamphlet in summary form 
without unnecessary details or discussion, has been some- 
what more fully presented and more material has been 
added; the data from which the deductions were drawn 
have been definitely indicated and the statistics have 
been made more complete wherever practicable. 
I. Enrollment of Classical Students in Secondary 
Schools 
The assaults which have recently been made upon 
the study of Latin have given the impression in some 
quarters that Latin is upon its last legs in the secondary 
387 : : 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
    358 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
schools of the country. Indeed, one of the most promi- 
nent advocates of the displacement in the school curricu- 
lum of such “traditional” subjects as algebra, Latin and 
history by “modern” and “practical” subjects declared 
not long ago in a public address that he was unjustly 
accused of “trying to kill Latin”; that, on the contrary, 
it “was dead already” and he was merely helping to 
bury it. 
The status of Latin in the secondary schools of the 
country is a matter not of opinion but of fact; and in 
the interpretation of the facts, which are accessible to 
all in the Reports of the United States Commissioner 
of Education, the weight of public opinion, which in the 
end determines which subjects shall be pursued in the 
high schools and which shall be preferred because of 
their real or imagined value to the youth of the land, is 
the factor chiefly to be recognized. Innovations in the 
school curriculum are frequently made, not so much in 
response to popular demand as in consequence of the 
agitation of professional educators, whereas the persis- 
tence of the older studies in spite of the increasing com- 
petition of a large variety of new subjects which are 
generally advertised and zealously promoted as making 
for practical success in life must be taken as evidence 
of a firmly rooted conviction on the part of the masses. 
The following table, which gives the enrollment of 
pupils in the secondary schools of the United States 
from 1890 to 1915 at five-year periods, reproduces the 
statistics of the Report of the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education for 1916, Vol. II, page 489:

As regards the present status of Latin the last column 
of the table shows that: 
1—Next after English, history and algebra, which 
are required at some period of practically all pupils in 
high schools and academies, Latin now has the largest 
enrollment of any subject; 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
a 
* 360 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
2—Latin is the one language, except English, which 
is most generally studied in our high schools and 
academies; 
8—Latin is taken by a larger number of pupils than 
French, German and Spanish combined, and by eighty 
per cent more than physics and chemistry combined; 
4—Turning to the other subjects, which are not usu- 
ally required for entrance to college, we find that Latin 
is taken by only twelve and one-half per cent fewer 
students than physical geography, physiology, botany, 
general biology, zoology and geology combined; and by 
twelve and one-half per cent more than domestic econ- 
omy, manual training, agriculture, bookkeeping and 
“idustrial”—the “‘practical” subjects—combined. 
The general availability of Latin, therefore, for the 
young men and women in the secondary schools who 
care to study it is not open to question. Every public 
high school and academy in the country, practically 
without exception, offers instruction in it; and accord- 
ing to the general testimony of the school examiners who 
are sent out by the large universities to pass upon the 
quality of instruction given in the several subjects ac- 
cepted for admission to college, Latin and mathematics 
are the two subjects in which the instruction is most 
likely to be found satisfactory. ‘The country has for 
generations been well supplied by the colleges and uni- 
versities with capable teachers of Latin. 
The growth of Latin in the secondary schools is 
also shown in the following table of percentages (Re- 
port of Commissioner, p. 489). The percentages give

It will be noted that between the years 1890 and 1905 
the Latin enrollment increased at an astonishing rate, 
not only absolutely but relatively, the percentage of all 
secondary pupils studying it rising almost steadily from 
83.62 in 1890 to 49.69 in 1905, or a gain of 16.07 per 
cent. No other subject made an equal gain in this 
period, algebra gaining 18.66 per cent, history 12.67,
-P-A-G-E-370
  862 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
German 8.86, geometry 7.77 and French 1.99, whereas 
physics lost 5.70 per cent, chemistry 2.58 and Greek 
2.14. The period 1905-1915 on the other hand was 
characterized by the introduction of new subjects into 
the curriculum. In these the enrollment was neces- 
sarily at the expense of the older subjects. Rhetoric and 
English literature, which had first appeared in the Re- 
ports in 1895 and 1900 respectively, claimed in 1915 
55.61 and 56.07 per cent of the total enrollment, and the 
subjects introduced between 1905 and 1915, taken as a 
whole, succeeded by 1915 in controlling almost one- 
fourth of the total amount of attendance in the second- 
ary school studies. A glance at the table of percentages 
will show the entire list. They are vocal music, drawing, 
domestic economy, manual training, botany, civics, agri- 
culture, general biology, bookkeeping, zoology, Spanish 
and “industrial”—the last a term both vague and 
obvious. Only three of the older subjects gained in 
this period, namely history (10.96 per cent), German 
(8.85) and chemistry (0.59), all the rest losing: Latin 
10.66 per cent, algebra 7.17, physics 1.88, Greek 1.85, 
geometry 1.04 and French 0.86. Even so, Latin re- 
tains the first place among all the subjects not required 
of practically all students in secondary schools. 
The high enrollment maintained by such subjects as 
Latin and mathematics, probably the most difficult in 
the high school curriculum, in the face of the increasing 
competition of new subjects, many of which are of a 
vocational character, gives evidence of a widespread and 
powerful belief in their efficacy in modern education. 
Theirs is clearly the strength, not of tradition merely, 
but of proved worth. Tradition, for example, has un- 
fortunately not protected Greek, whose practical uses
-P-A-G-E-371
  STATISTICS 363 
and relation to western civilization are not so immedi- 
ately obvious to the ordinary man as these values of 
Latin are. 
In this general connection, moreover, an interesting 
investigation made in 1915 by Dr. Harris Hancock, 
professor of mathematics in the University of Cincin- 
nati, may be cited as showing how enlightened opinion 
stands, as regards the desirability not only of keeping 
classics and mathematics in the high school curriculum, 
but of requiring their study of all high school pupils. 
Professor Hancock addressed a letter of inquiry to 
representative business men, clergymen, lawyers, physi- 
cians and other leading men in Cincinnati. Of the re- 
plies received seven favored a high school course of 
study with mathematics and classics optional, thirty- 
four favored a course with mathematics required and 
classics optional, none favored a course with classics re- 
quired and mathematics optional, while fifty-three (a 
clear majority) favored a course in which both classics 
and mathematics are required. 
He addressed the same inquiry to a similar list of 
" representative men in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, 
Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Atlanta, Cleve- 
land, Chicago, St. Louis, San Francisco and other 
cities. Of the replies received five favored a high school 
course of study with mathematics and classics optional, 
twenty-five favored a course with mathematics required 
and classics optional, two favored a course with classics 
required and mathematics optional, while fifty-six (a 
large majority) favored a course in which both mathe- 
matics and classics are required. 
The combined result is as follows:

The general agreement in the ratios of opinion on 
the four plans in Cincinnati and the other cities is strik- 
ing and is indicative of a strong trend of opinion among 
influential practical men in favor of requiring both 
classics and mathematics in our secondary education.

and Society, June 19, 1915. 
II. Record of Classical Students in College Entrance 
Examinations 
Dr. Abraham Flexner, in his pamphlet entitled “A 
Modern ‘School” (1916), makes a categorical arraign- 
ment of both the teaching of Latin and the study of 
Latin itself. In order to prove that classical teachers 
fail to teach Latin well, he cites some figures selected 
from the Report for 1915 of the College Entrance Ex- 
amination Board. Regarding the statistical methods 
employed by Dr. Flexner in the attempt to make out 
his case, reference will be made later on to refutations 
published by Dr. Charles H. Forbes of Phillips And- 
over Academy and Dr. W. V. McDuffee, President of 
the Massachusetts State Teachers’ Association; and a 
statement will be quoted of a professor of economics and 
statistics, Dr. Walter M. Adriance of Princeton Uni- 
versity. But first there should be cited a positive state-

ment of extraordinary educational value and of unim- 
peachable authority. 
The tests of the College Entrance Examination 
Board do indeed afford a basis, strangely overlooked by 
Dr. Flexner, for the comparison of the classical’ and 
the non-classical candidates who take the Board’s pa- 
pers. Whether or not the results of such a comparison 
warrant deductions as to the quality of the instruction 
received by the two sets of candidates need not concern 
us here, since the classically trained candidates make the 
better showing. It clearly appears from a special in- 
vestigation made for the Princeton Conference by the 
Secretary of the Board that the training which the clas- 
sical students have received, whether because of the sub- 
ject, the teaching, the inherent ability of the candidates 
who elect the classics in the schools, or all three com- 
bined, has somehow enabled them to sustain the exami- 
nation tests of the Board with notably greater success 
than those who lack this particular training. © 
The Secretary of the College Entrance Examination 
Board has tabulated the comparative records of the 
classical and the non-classical students who took the ex- 
aminations of the Board in the three years 1914, 1915 
and 1916. There were 21,108 candidates, and they 
took 52,145 examinations. ‘The following facts, ex- 
pressed in percentages, are based upon the results of 
the examinations in all subjects except Greek and 
Latin: 
1The term “classical” as here used means candidates who offered Latin” 
or Greek or both, “non-classical” those who offered neither Latin nor 
Greek.

  366 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
A. ComBINED Ratines In ALL THE Non- 
CrassicaL SUBJECTS 
Candidates who obtained a rating of 90 to 100 
2.95 per cent of all the classical candidates 
2.05 per cent of all the non-classical candidates 
The classical students show a superiority of 44 per cent. 
Candidates who obtained a rating of 75 to 89 
17.81 per cent of all the classical candidates 
12.31 per cent of all the non-classical candidates 
The classical students show a superiority of about 40 
per cent. 
Candidates who obtained a rating of 60 to 100 
51.96 per cent of all the classical candidates 
40.97 per cent of all the non-classical candidates 
The classical students show a superiority of about 27 
per cent. 
B. Raines In THE InpIvipuaL Non-cassicaL 
SUBJECTS 
In all but one of these subjects taken by any large 
number of candidates, the classical students show a 
marked superiority over the non-classical. This is es- 
pecially true in the case of the high ratings, the pro- 
portion of classical students attaining them being 
noticeably larger. The single exception is physics, in 
which about one per cent more of the non-classical can- 
didates than of the classical candidates passed the ex- 
aminations. But the classical group excelled the others 
in the higher grades even in physics, the rating of 90 
to 100 having been obtained by 7.64 per cent of the 
classical candidates and by 6.79 per cent of the non- 
classical. 
In English the classical candidates had an advantage, 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
  STATISTICS 367 
ranging from 285 per cent in the highest rating (90 to 
100) to 58 per cent in the passing grade (i.e., 58 per 
cent of the classical candidates passed as against 88.5 
per cent of the non-classical). 
In history the classical candidates surpassed the non- 
classical in all three ratings, their superiority being 
107.5 per cent in the highest rating, 84.4 per cent in the 
next, and 29.4 per cent in the record of those who 
passed. 
In mathematics the classical candidates were more 
successful in all ratings, especially in the rating 90 to 
100, where they showed a superiority of 59 per cent 
(4.47 per cent, as compared with 2.81). 
In physics, as already noted, the classical students 
were slightly behind the non-classical, the inferiority in 
the passing grade being 2.5 per cent (52.78 per cent as 
compared with 54.06). In chemistry, on the other hand, 
their superiority was 12 per cent (51.94 per cent as com- 
pared with 46.37) in the case of those who passed the 
examinations. 
In French and German the classical candidates were 
decidedly ahead in all grades for both subjects, their 
superiority in the highest grade being 89 per cent for 
French and 125 per cent for German. 
The number of candidates in the other subjects is too 
small to yield percentages of any significance. For ex- 
ample, civil government was taken by 65 candidates, 
zoology by 58, drawing by 224, music by 36, biology by 
235, botany by 111, Spanish by 146 and geography by 
160. But it may be noted that the non-classical stu- 
dents excelled somewhat in civil government, zoology 
and drawing, while the classical candidates who ob- 
tained the rating of 90 to 100 in drawing were more 
numerous; and that in music, biology, botany, Spanish 
and geography the classical candidates again excelled. 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  368 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
In a pamphlet entitled “The Sham Argument against 
Latin” (1917) Professor Charles H. Forbes, of Phil- 
lips Andover Academy, after quoting Dr. Abraham 
Flexner’s paragraph (introduced below, p. 375, in the 
letter of Professor Adriance) which is designed to prove 
the failure of the current teaching of Latin, makes the 
following rejoinder: 
“In 1915 the Board set 12 different examinations in 
Latin. Amongst these was Latin C, an examination in 
Cicero given in that year for the last time. Only 64 
candidates, of whom 84 were recommended by their 
teachers, tried the examination, because it was obsolete. 
76.6 per cent of these 64 did fail to get 60 per cent. The 
main examination, however, as nobody could fail to 
know, with the report before his eyes, was Latin 4, 
Cicero and sight, a more severe test of Latin knowledge. 
This examination was taken by 1,210 candidates, of 
whom 53.1 per cent failed to get 60 per cent. This was 
a bad showing, of course, but it is 22.5 per cent better 
than the trivial examination of 64 students which he 
[Dr. Flexner] chose as representative. .. . 
“Tn the figures for Virgil he has exercised the same 
skill in the manipulation of statistics, for he chose Latin 
D, another course then given for the last time, and 
which only 64 students took. 75 per cent of these did 
fail to get a grade of 60 per cent. But the real test, 
Latin 5, Virgil and sight, was taken by 776 candidates, 
of whom 38.9 per cent failed to get a grade of 60 per 
cent. This is 86.1 per cent better than the Virgil which 
he chose for illuminating purposes. Of these two 
craftily selected examinations out of a total of 12 in 
Latin, he proceeded to generalize upon the subject of 
Latin as an egregious failure.
-P-A-G-E-377
STATISTICS 869 
“T submit that any fair judgment of the statistics of 
Latin must premise the inclusion of its 12 parts in those 
statistics. Now the general average of the 5979 Latin 
examinations reveals the fact that just 41 per cent of 
the candidates failed to secure a grade of 60 per cent. 
This is not 76.6 per cent by a long shot. The general 
average of recommended students was 31.6 per cent. 
These appear to be formidable losses, and are in part 
properly chargeable to poor teaching, but when we com- 
pare this 41 per cent failure with the results in other 
subjects of the Board examinations, we discover that, 
in a total list of 16 subjects, Latin stands seventh in ex- 
cellence. Latin had 5979 papers. Three of those sub- 
jects which stood higher than Latin were zoology with 
just 15 papers, botany with 17 and biology with 16. I 
submit that these numbers are too trivial to allow of any 
comparative judgment with a subject involving almost 
6,000 examinations. Eliminating them, we find that 
Latin stands fourth in the list of considerable subjects 
for which a reasonable basis of judgment is at hand. 
But on any basis, if Latin is despicable, what must we 
say of German, chemistry, drawing, music, mathe- 
matics, English, Spanish, geography and history, all of 
which are below it? Latin stands fifth on the entire list 
of recommended students... . 
“Dr. Flexner shrewdly refrains from mentioning 
Greek; it is so hopelessly dead, as people think. But 
here again let us examine the facts. There were 738 
papers in Greek subjects. We may get an illuminating 
view of the popularity of some subjects by observing 
that the total number of candidates in biology, botany, 
geology, zoology, drawing and music all together was 
168, or 2 less than the number that took Xenophon
-P-A-G-E-378
  * 810 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
alone in Greek! Poor old Greek need not yet hide its 
comely form in a winding sheet. In general average 
Greek, with 788 examinations, stood second on the list 
of 16 subjects with a record of 23.9 per cent of failures 
to secure a grade of 60 per cent. Zoology, with only 15 
candidates, is hardly entitled to its position as first. In 
the total list of 51 examinations given by the Board it is 
instructive to notice that Greek G is first, Greek CH is 
second, Greek A2 is third and Greek C is fourth.” 
At the end of his pamphlet Dr. Forbes gives tables, 
prepared by himself, showing the results of the Col- 
lege Entrance Board examinations in 1915 and 1916, 
in which the subjects of the several papers are arranged 
in the order of the success of the candidate in dealing 
with them. The last two tables give the combined re- 
sults in all the papers set in each department of study, 
ie. all the Latin papers (12 in 1915, 8 in 1916) are 
combined under the title “Latin,” etc. These tables 
present so clearly the actual facts, and make Dr. Flex- 
ner’s methods in deducing his sweeping conclusions so 
patent, that they are here reproduced in full:

Since Dr. Abraham Flexner directed his attack not 
only against the study of Greek and Latin but also 
against the current teaching of the classics, and since 
classical teachers, being under indictment, might be 
supposed to be prejudiced witnesses, even in dealing 
with published statistics, Dean West requested a spe- 
cialist in statistics, Professor Adriance of Princeton, to 
give a professional opinion upon the statistical portion 
of Dr. Flexner’s argument. This opinion was pub- 
lished in the Pamphlet of the Conference under the title 
of “Misleading Statistics,” and is here reproduced:  
-P-A-G-E-383
  STATISTICS 875 
May 28, 1917. 
Dean Anprew F. WEst, 
Dear Sir: © 
At you: request I have read Dr. Abraham Flex- 
ner’s paper “A) Modern School” for the purpose of ex- 
amining his use of statistics. 
Dr. Flexner’ :olds that tradition determines the pres- 
ent day curriculum, which for this reason fails, as a sys- 
tem of education, to meet the demands of modern life. 
He says on page six of his pamphlet: 
“It is perhaps worth while stopping long enough 
to show by figures the extent to which our cur- 
rent teaching fails. . . . We know that a large 
percentage of the better students of these sub- 
jects (referring to Latin, algebra and geometry) 
try the College Entrance Examinations, and that 
for these examinations many receive special drill 
in addition to the regular teaching. Now in the 
examinations held by the College Entrance 
Board in 1915, 76.6 per cent of the candidates 
failed to make even a mark of 60 per cent in 
Cicero; 75 per cent failed to make a mark of 60 
per cent in the first six books of Virgil, every 
line of which they had presumably read and re- 
read; 69.7 per cent of those examined in algebra 
from quadratics on failed to make as much as 60 
per cent; 42.4 per cent failed to make 60 per cent 
in plane geometry.” 
Dr. Flexner would have a “modern” curriculum with 
four main subdivisions—science, industry, aesthetics, 
and civics (p. 10). He says further (p. 18): 
“Neither Latin nor Greek should be contained in
-P-A-G-E-384
  
  876 VALUE OF THE oe 
the curriculum of the Modern School. ... A 
positive case can be made out for neither. . . . I 
have quoted figures to show how egregiously we 
fail to teach Latin. These figures mean that in- 
stead of getting orderly training by solving diffi- 
culties in Latin translation or composition, pupils 
guess, fumble, receive surreptitious assistance, or 
accept on faith the injunctions of teacher and 
grammar. The only discipline that most stu- 
dents get from their classical studies is a disci- 
pline in doing things as they should not be done.” 
A comparison of the passages just quoted with the 
figures as they stand in the Report of the College En- 
trance Examination Board makes it clear that the sta- 
tistics have been misused in a very extraordinary way. 
In the first place (as was pointed out by W. V. Mc- 
Duffee, President of the Massachusetts State Teachers’ 
Association, in the New York Times of Feb. 5, 1917), 
Dr. Flexner’s statement that “a large percentage of the 
better students of Latin try the College Entrance Board 
Examinations,” was probably not correct. On the con- 
trary, those who took these examinations were largely 
candidates not well qualified to pass the examinations 
of particular colieges, or to obtain certificates for en- 
trance to those colleges which were in the habit of ad- 
mitting on certificate. Dr. Flexner’s figures have to do, 
then, not with the “better students” of Latin, as he con- 
tends, but with a group from which most or many of 
the better students had been eliminated, either by hav- 
ing taken the examinations of the particular institutions 
they intended to enter, or by having secured admission 
to college on the certificate plan.
-P-A-G-E-385
    STATISTICS 377 
Dr. McDuffee has also pointed out that in trying to 
show that Latin is not being successfully taught, Dr. 
Flexner did not take all the facts into account, but made 
an entirely improper selection from the data at hand.

The matters to be noted here are as follows: Of the 
total number of papers in Latin (5979), 59 per cent 
scored 60 or above. The very lowest figures are for 
items 8 and 9 above, namely Cicero and the Aeneid. In 
these two subjects there were only 64 candidates (in 
each), as compared with 1210 in “Cicero and Sight” and 
776 in “Virgil and Sight.” In the two together there 
were only 128 candidates out of a total of 5979. But 
these two subjects are the ones selected by Dr. Flexner 
to show “how egregiously we fail to teach Latin.”
-P-A-G-E-386
  378 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
The significant thing about the table is that 59 per 
cent of all papers submitted scored 60 or better. And 
if the statistics had included students offering Latin for 
entrance at the special examinations held by the colleges 
as well as at the examinations given by the Board, there 
is reason to think the showing would have been still bet- 
ter. At any rate it is clear that Dr. Flexner’s figures as 
cited are not representative of the facts as disclosed by 
the table. 
And a little further down in the column which Dr. 
Flexner had before him we find for Greek the remark- 
ably high percentage of 76.1. Surely if we can infer 
from this column anything as to the success attained in 
teaching the various subjects, we must conclude that 
Greek and Latin are taught more successfully than al- 
most any other subject. Dr. Flexner, omitting entirely 
the 76 per cent for Greek, leaves us with the quite er- 
roneous impression that about 75 per cent of the candi- 
dates in the classical subjects fail to score as high as 
60 per cent in their examinations. The figures really 
tell a very different story. 
Very truly yours,

III. Record of Classical Students in School and College 
The records of the College Entrance Examination 
Board have shown how well the classically trained can- 
didates for admission to college sustain the test of uni- 
form examinations in comparison with those who have 
not had this training. The scholarship and honors rec-

ords of those schools and colleges in which a distinction 
can be made between the classical* and the non-classical 
students ought to furnish an even better basis of com- 
parison; for whereas in the former we have only the 
single final test, in the latter the comparison rests upon 
the daily performance through several years of sus- 
tained endeavor. Accordingly a special committee was 
assigned the task, in connection with the Princeton Con- 
ference, of conducting an investigation whose object 
was to ascertain how the classical students in school and 
college succeed in competition with the non-classical— 
whether they fall behind their associates, keep even with 
them, or surpass them. 
As the result of this investigation it is possible to give 
here, through the courtesy of the officials of the schools 
and colleges concerned, the combined scholarship and 
honors records of a considerable number of representa- 
2In the school statistics a student is designated as “classical” who has 
had the full course in Latin; in the college statistics the “classical” student 
is one who presented for admission either three or four years of Latin. 
It was found impracticable, with the means at the disposal of the com- 
mittee, to secure the data for such college students as continue the study 
of the classics for one or more years, in comparison with the others, al- 
though it was realized that the information to be derived from such data 
might be of unusual educational value. 
It should be noted that the schools in which all or practically all pupils 
take the full course in Latin, or Latin and Greek, and colleges whose stu- 
dents on admission all offer four years of Latin (many of them Greek as 
well) could not be taken into consideration in this investigation, since they 
afford no basis for a comparison between the two classes of students con- 
cerned. Among the schools which on this account are not considered are: 
the Blake School (Minneapolis), the Boston Public Latin and the Boston 
Girls’ Latin Schools, the Country Day School of Newton, Mass., the Groton 
School, the Hotchkiss School, the Roxbury Latin School, St. Mark’s School 
and the Taft School; and among the colleges: Bryn Mawr, Georgetown, 
Hamilton, Johns Hopkins, Mt. Holyoke, Princeton, Smith, Vassar, Welles- 
ley, Williams, Yale.

tive schools and colleges. The committee earnestly de- 
sired to obtain the same information from a very much 
larger number of institutions, and made every effort to 
do so; but in many schools and colleges the facts re- 
quired are not recorded in such a way as to be available 
for the investigation of comparative standing, and could 
not be made available except by an intricate, extended 
and expensive investigation, for which neither the time 
nor the means were at hand; while in other institutions 
the recording officials have been so overwhelmed with 
work, in consequence of war conditions, that they have 
had no time to compile the statistics requested of them. 
Nevertheless, the data thus far received from institu- 
tions in which a comparison can be made are extensive 
enough to be significant. The reports cover the cases 
of 2799 classical and 5606 non-classical sudents from 
nineteen high schools and academies,* and also of 4092 
classical and 2008 non-classical students from seventeen 
colleges and universities.*

  STATISTICS 381 
A. High Schools and Academies 
The combined data from the nineteen high schools 
tnd academies reporting yield the following results: 
Students receiving High Honors at Graduation 
were 18 per cent of all the classical students, but only 
7.2 per cent of all the non-classical students. 
That is: The classical students show a superiority of 
150 per cent. 
Students receiving Honors at Graduation 
were 82.1 per cent of all the classical students, but only 
80.8 per cent of all the non-classical students. 
That is: The classical students show a superiority of 
36.7 per cent. 
Students receiving Honors or Prizes for Debating, 
Speaking or Essay-writing 
were 8.8 per cent of all the classical students, but only 
3.5 per cent of all the non-classical students. 
That is: The classical students show a superiority of 
150 per cent. . 
The reports from all schools, including a good many 
whose data have not been embodied in the above com- 
bined statistics of the nineteen schools, are unanimous 
in showing the superiority of the classical students. In 
a few reports, in a very few individual items, the result 
was unfavorable to the classical students, but no insti- 
tution made a report which on the whole was anything 
but distinctly favorable.

were 5.1 per cent of all the classical students, but only 
8.2 per cent of all the non-classical students. 
That is: The classical students show a superiority of 
59.4 per cent. 
In the case of the colleges, as of the schools, the re- 
ports received from all the institutions, including many 
(see p. 880, notes 8 and 4) which are not represented in 
the combined table, agree in attributing a general superi- 
ority to the classical students. There are no exceptions 
among them.° 
The statistics which have been presented deeeete 
careful study. They represent a wide range of educa- 
tional experience under varied social conditions, and 
may fairly be considered as typical of the situation 
throughout the country in institutions in which there 
_ are two classes of students, not too unequal in numbers, 
which are clearly differentiated from each other by the 
character of the scholastic training they have received. 
They cover the cases of 29,508 pupils in the secondary 
schools, the majority of whom have either completed a 
four-year course or are well advanced in it, and of 6,095 
college students who have completed the work for the 
Bachelor’s degree. The candidates examined by the 
College Entrance Examination Board were prepared 
for college in public and private schools in all parts of 
the United States. The schools and colleges are con- 
fined to no one section of the country, although the 
southern states are meagerly represented. 
The figures tell the same story with amazing uni- 
5The superiority of non-classical students in winning college prizes 
in mathematics and science is the only instance where the classical students 
do not come out ahead, In spite of this particular instance, the marked 
general superiority of the classical students in every reporting college 
remains conclusively established. 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  384 VALUE OF THE CLASSICS 
  formity, no matter what kind of intellectual test is ap- 
plied: the classically trained students outrank their as- 
sociates, win more honors and prizes and in general 
furnish the intellectual leaders in their several institu- 
tions. The difference is not slight or insignificant—it 
is in most cases overwhelming. And it is not confined 
to those departments and activities in which a linguistic 
training might be expected to give its possessor a clear 
advantage, as for example in writing and debating, but 
is almost as marked in the general subjects of the col- 
lege curriculum. Note for instance that the average 
proportion of the classical students in college who win 
the prizes and honors in other than classical subjects is 
nearly one half larger than that of the non-classical 
students. And though the proportion of this superior- 
ity differs in different institutions, in only one® of ten 
which reported is this situation reversed. The classical 
students excel, not only in the older colleges of homo- 
geneous clientele, like Bowdoin, Haverford and Ken- 
yon, but also in the large universities of more recent 
origin, such as Stanford University and the State uni- 
versities of Colorado and Nebraska. 
Is it necessary to interpret facts so perspicuous as 
these? The objector will doubtless urge that there are 
factors at work other than those which the defender of 
the classics is disposed to emphasize. He may assert 
for example that the better class of students are often 
induced to study the classics because of the greater 
prestige of the Arts degree, for which Latin and Greek 
are prerequisite in the college which they have selected. 
There is little if any force to this argument, however, 
6In this institution 37 of 39 prizes offered were in mathematics and 
science.
-P-A-G-E-393
  STATISTICS 885 
as applied to the statistics here presented, because in the 
first place Greek,' which differentiates the Arts degree 
from the other degrees in a number of institutions, has 
been left out of consideration altogether; in the second 
place those institutions which require Latin of all or 
practically all their students have been excluded; and 
thirdly a very considerable number of the institutions 
which have been included grant only the Arts degree. 
It may be urged, again, that the institutions from which 
these statistics are drawn emphasize the classical studies. 
A sufficient answer is found in the enrollment: the non- 
classical students in the schools and colleges here re- 
ported outnumber the classical by over ten per cent. 
If the argument be advanced that there are other im- 
portant ingredients in the education of the students 
here designated as classical, and that classical studies 
are therefore not responsible for the whole of the superi- 
ority indicated in the figures, the point will readily be 
conceded. The classical studies are difficult, and the 
students who elect to pursue them are more than likely 
to be found taking also the other difficult subjects of a 
disciplinary character, as for example mathematics and 
physics. In any event, the argument carries with it the 
admission that the classical students are, generally 
speaking, of superior mental endowment, and prosecute 
the severer studies with greater success than the non- 
classical students who often pursue the easier studies.

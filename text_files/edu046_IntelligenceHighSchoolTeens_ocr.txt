PREFACE 
Amonc the contributions that the humanistic sciences 
have made to twentieth century civilization the method 
~ and technique of the survey stand preéminent. By sur- 
vey is meant the measurement of group traits — physical, 
social, economic, psychological — the quantitative expres- 
sion of the amounts of these traits found among the mem- 
bers of any group, and the distribution of such traits 
among members of the group. The survey has been 
used in the study of many varieties of group life— 
schools, social communities (urban and rural), industrial 
and mercantile establishments, and such particular classes 
of individuals as moral delinquents, for example, and the 
feebleminded. 
As a result of these surveys much light has been thrown 
upon the physical, social, economic, and psychological 
status of groups in which society is greatly interested. 
We have discovered the true conditions existing in a 
number of fields and have adopted intelligent means of 
improving them, such as suitable housing of the poor, 
sane and curative treatment of criminals, and the classifi- 
cation of school children and college students into homo- 
geneous groups for special educational treatment. 
In all these social reforms psychological tests have 
played a very large and ever increasing part. Though only 
a few years old, they have been so serviceable in the 
improvement of various classes and conditions of mankind 
that when the officials in charge of the education of the

  youth of the commonwealth of Indiana wished to discover 
the intellectual standing of the high school students of the 
state with a view to providing better means for the conserva- 
tion and development of individual capacities and talents, 
they chose the psychological test as their most efficient tool. 
The chief purpose of the book is to present in as clear 
and concise a manner as possible the facts obtained from 
a rather extensive study of the intelligence of high school 
seniors and to point out the significance that these facts 
have, not merely for educators, social workers, and business 
men, but for all persons interested in the conservation and 
cultivation of the human resources of the state. 
In presenting these facts we have tried to devise a 
method that would be not merely adequate and reliable 
for our purpose, but clear and intelligible to laymen, and 
adapted for use in similar surveys. We have tried to 
show by an actual example how eatensive mental surveys 
may be conducted and to illustrate a method of handling 
and presenting the results, which may be helpful to those 
contemplating similar surveys of the human resources of 
a community or school. 
The results of the survey have proved of more than 
local significance. 
1. They are of interest to educators of all communities, 
who, believing in individualized instruction, desire to 
inaugurate a régime under which they may seek out the 
peculiar needs and capacities of each pupil and adapt 
education thereto. The book is, therefore, well adapted 
for use in teachers’ study clubs and for classes in mental 
measurements.

2. They will interest social workers who see that the 
social welfare of the individual and the state is closely 
wrapped up with intellectual endowment, educational op- 
portunity, and the rapport between the two. 
3. They will interest thoughtful men in business and 
industry who see that the solution of human problems in 
the industrial world is intertwined with the factors dealt 
with in this book. 
To all these it is hoped that the general method of this 
survey and the results obtained will prove helpful for the 
solution of many of the problems that confront them. ~ 
The study was made with the authority and full co- 
operation and aid of the Indiana State Board of Education, 
which printed the examiner’s guide and all blanks used 
to obtain detailed reports from individual schools. The 
Board also furnished the postage and clerical help required 
to arrange for the giving of the tests and for collecting the 
data. The Department of Psychology at Indiana Uni- 
versity prepared the intelligence scale used in the survey, 
furnished all the test materials, bearing also the expense 
of making the tabulations. 
Arrangements with teachers and high school principals 
for conducting the mental examinations were made by 
Oscar H. Williams, at that time High School Inspector 
for Indiana. He also collected through his office the 
returns from individual schools. More than five hundred 
teachers, high school principals, and superintendents took 
part in making the survey. The author wishes, therefore, 
to take this first opportunity of acknowledging his great 
indebtedness to them for their interest, codperation,

and personal help, and desires to thank the State Board 
of Education and its president, L. N. Hines, for their 
coéperation and financial assistance. It is only through 
such codperative work that our most important educa- 
tional problems can be investigated and eventually solved. 
The author is indebted largely to the advice and en- 
couragement of friends for whatever merit this work 
possesses. Dr. S. L. Pressey, Research Assistant in the 
Department of Psychology, Indiana University, prepared 
and verified the intelligence scale used in the survey. 
H. G. Childs, Professor of Secondary Education and H. D. 
Kitson, Professor of Psychology, at Indiana Univer- 
sity, read the entire manuscript and have given helpful 
criticisms. Without the codperation, encouragement, and 
assistance of Mr. Oscar H. Williams, State Supervisor of 
Teacher Training, this study could not have been under- 
taken or finished. Mr. Williams not only sensed from 
the beginning the practical value and importance of the 
survey, but was chiefly responsible for interesting the 
State Board of Education and the school officials of the 
state in the survey. He helped plan the study, write 
the examiner’s guide, and prepare the report blanks and 
special helps for teachers. He also read the entire manu- 
script and in ways too numerous to mention has given 
valuable assistance throughout the study. 
Such extensive and hearty codperation, rare as it is, 
augurs well for the future of codperative research of the 
type recommended and urged in this book.

PURPOSE, METHOD, AND SCOPE OF THE 
SURVEY 
CHAPTER I 
AIMS OF THE SURVEY 
In making this state-wide mental survey tof high school 
seniors the writer had in mind certain definite purposes and 
problems to guide him in the collection of data and in the 
organization and interpretation of the results. 
1. Location of the ablest seniors. The original and 
chief purpose of the study was to locate by means of reliable 
intelligence tests the ablest students graduating from the 
high schools of the state during the year, and to suggest 
means whereby they might be definitely encouraged to 
attend college and, if need be, aided financially so that 
they might continue their education beyond the high 
school stage. The study was planned and carried to 
completion on the theory that all high school graduates 
1Planned and made in collaboration with Oscar H. Williams, State 
Supervisor of Teacher Training for Indiana, Indianapolis, Indiana. 
i
-P-A-G-E-20
    2 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
who possess exceptional mental endowment should be 
definitely located and encouraged to continue their educa- 
tion in a college or university. 
Nothing contributes more directly to the progress of 
society and the state than the conservation and proper cul- 
tivation of the mental capacities and abilities of the most 
gifted individuals belonging to each succeeding generation. 
It is these superior individuals who become the leaders of 
the race, in government, in industry, in religion, in science, 
andinart. Their abilities should, therefore, be carefully 
conserved and fully cultivated. 
A few attempts have been made by colleges and univer- 
sities to attract and serve this special group of individuals. 
Some universities are giving mental tests to those who pre- 
sent themselves for admission and are using the results of 
such tests as a basis for the selection of students. All 
colleges eliminate in the freshman year large numbers of 
students who are not able or willing to profit by the college 
work. Such methods enable the colleges to select and re- 
tain the best young people who actually apply for admis- 
sion. They can never become an effective means for locat- 
ing and selecting the most intelligent individuals unless 
these superior individuals actually present themselves for 
admission to college. But by giving an intelligence test 
to all high school seniors just before graduation from high 
school, it should be possible not merely to locate all in- 
dividuals eligible for college who possess the highest grades 
of intelligence, but we should be in a position to encourage 
and help them complete their education and thus develop 
for the state their superior capacities and talents.
-P-A-G-E-21
  AIMS OF THE SURVEY 3 
2. College intentions of this superior group. It was 
planned, in the second place, to ascertain to what extent 
the colleges are now reaching these exceptionally en- 
dowed individuals. Arrangements were made, therefore, 
to ascertain among other things the exact college inten- 
tions of each student graduating from the high schools 
of the state, in order that we might determine whether or 
not the colleges were attracting the high school seniors 
who possess the highest grades of intelligence. We de- 
sired to obtain, by making a comparison of the intelli- 
gence scores of those actually going to college and those 
not planning to attend, some idea of the mental strength 
of the young people whom our colleges actually attract. 
3. Educational direction of the brightest seniors. It 
was also believed that a reliable intelligence rating would 
greatly aid deans and college faculties in directing the edu- 
cational work of freshmen students. It is an indisputable 
fact that students with superior mental ability often do 
only average or even inferior work in college. Students 
of meager or inferior ability, on the other hand, are often 
expected by their instructors to do a superior grade of 
work. To give college authorities information along this 
line, high school principals were asked to have the intelli- 
gence score made by each senior student recorded on the 
permanent school records and sent with his scholarship 
standing to the college authorities, if the senior expected 
to attend college, or to his prospective employer if he in- 
tended to go to work. In this way college authorities 
would secure some idea at least of the grade of work that 
might reasonably be expected from each freshman student.  
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  Such intelligence ratings would also give university author- 
ities the necessary data for determining whether the appli- 
cant for admission to college had sufficient mental ability 
to profit by a college course. The purpose and advantages 
of this plan were carefully explained to the members of 
each senior class when the tests were given. 
4, Extent to which the high schools and colleges are 
conserving the mental capacities of this exceptional group 
of young people. A fourth purpose in making this inves- 
tigation was to collect facts that would assist in determin- 
ing the extent to which the high schools of the state are 
succeeding in adapting their work to the mental strength, 
interests, and needs of this exceptional group of young 
people. Are the special capacities and mental abilities 
of these exceptional students being properly cultivated 
and conserved? This we hoped to ascertain by a study 
of the scholastic records made in the past by the entire 
group of seniors taking the tests; by a study of the extent 
to which they had been accelerated, retarded, or normally 
promoted by the school; and by a study of their chief 
scholastic and vocational interests as indicated by their 
favorite study in high school and by their choice of an 
occupation. 
5. Native mental endowment and school success. It 
was further desired to study in this investigation the rela- 
tion that exists between native mental capacity or ability 
to learn and the scholastic success of the special senior 
groups examined. We desired to determine the extent to 
which native mental endowment is indicative of actual 
performance or success in school and to know whether the
-P-A-G-E-23
AIMS OF THE SURVEY 5 
  brightest seniors also made the best scholastic record in 
high school. In a word, to study carefully the relation 
that exists between the intelligence of high school seniors 
as indicated by the mental test scores, and the success 
they achieved in their high school work as shown by the 
average school marks obtained in all subjects studied dur- 
ing the junior year. An exact correlation between these 
two conditions was determined and a study made of the 
factors, other than intelligence, that contribute to an indi- 
vidual’s success in school. To get data or material on this 
problem we studied the records made by these seniors in 
high school, and we are now studying their intelligence 
scores as related to the scholarship record they are making 
in college. 
6. Kind and amount of vocational direction needed. 
One of the most important factors in the conservation and 
proper cultivation of the mental capacities of this group 
of superior young people is directing them toward the work 
in life that is best suited to their mental strength and in 
harmony with their native interests. We desired, there- 
fore, in this study not merely to get facts that would aid 
college and university authorities in directing their young 
people toward lines of work well suited to their mental 
strength and in harmony with their special capacities 
and interests, but to ascertain the degree to which the high 
schools of the state were actually succeeding in their solu- 
tion of this problem. 
It was believed that a reliable intelligence rating would 
be helpful to school and college faculties in giving their 
students wiser vocational guidance while they were being
-P-A-G-E-24
  é INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
trained for the duties of life. A reliable intelligence score 
is, perhaps, the best single criterion for determining the life 
career for which a student should prepare himself. The 
grade or type of general intelligence and training required 
for success in the more important occupations is rapidly 
being determined by testing those who have made or who 
are making a success in these fields of work. These norms, 
when taken together with the scores that high school or 
college students make on a reliable intelligence test, con- 
stitute, we believe, the first essential step in any practical 
and efficient plan for the educational and vocational guid- 
ance of youth. 
The need for wiser and more efficient vocational guidance 
of youth is apparent to all. One of the greatest social 
wastes of to-day is due to the fact that so many men and 
women are engaged in occupations far beneath the level 
of their mental ability, while others are attempting work 
too complex and intricate for their mental strength. 
Both groups are made unhappy and inefficient by the mal- 
adjustment. They often get a wrong or perverted notion 
about society and government and become socially ill- 
adjusted because of the faulty economic conditions under 
which they must work and because their education has 
been so poorly adapted to their mental capacity and voca- 
tional needs. It was hoped to obtain in this survey facts 
that would serve as a basis for correcting in some measure 
such social and human wastes. 
7. Democratic appeal of the high school. Another pur- 
pose of the investigation was to gather information show- 
ing the success that our high schools are having in reaching
-P-A-G-E-25
AIMS OF THE SURVEY te 
  and graduating all classes of our citizenship. The Amer- 
ican high school is supposed to be thoroughly democratic 
and to meet the needs of all classes of people. We, there- 
fore, desired to ascertain whether all occupational and eco- 
nomic classes found in the state had their full quota of 
representatives in the senior classes of the high school, 
and whether these schools were ministering adequately to 
the individual, social, and vocational needs of these vari- 
ous occupational and economic classes. In order to secure 
data that would enable us to solve this problem we had to 
obtain information showing the occupational and economic 
class to which each senior belonged and to correlate these 
facts with their scholastic and vocational interests shown 
by their choice of an occupation and their selection of 
favorite studies in high school. 
8. Mental capacity of seniors coming from different 
occupational and economic classes. It was also desired 
to ascertain the grades of intelligence possessed by the 
seniors coming from the various economic and occupational 
classes, in order to determine how the individuals who 
possessed the highest grades of intelligence were distributed 
among the various occupational and economic groups rep- 
resented in the senior classes of high schools; also to 
determine the relative mental strength of the representa- 
tives of these various occupational and economic groups. 
It has been generally assumed that people naturally group 
themselves into occupations according to their mental 
ability; that different grades of mental capacity are re- 
quired for different lines of work; and that the different 
economic strata in our society are merely the result of
-P-A-G-E-26

  differences in mental endowment. It was believed that 
a careful study of the grades of intelligence actually 
possessed by the representatives of these several classes 
would throw much light on such assumptions because it 
may be assumed that whatever mental differences exist 
between occupational groups among the people would be 
reflected in some measure among their children in high 
school. 
9. Differences between sections, communities, and 
individual schools. One of the most important original 
purposes of the study was to determine by means of reliable 
intelligence tests any differences that might exist in the 
mental endowment of the seniors coming from different 
communities and individual high schools. Systems of 
high school inspection and accrediting for college entrance 
have been based in general on the assumption that high 
schools located in every part of a state should measure up 
to the same standards of efficiency and achievement re- 
gardless of the mental endowment of their students. One 
of the purposes of this study was to ascertain how the 
individual high schools of the state compared in the mental 
strength of their senior classes and to acquaint teachers 
and school officials with any existent inequalities in the 
raw human material with which they have to work. 
10. Intelligence of senior boys and girls compared. 
Lastly, we desired to make a study of all sex differences 
that our survey might reveal. Sex differences have been 
shown to be of special importance when the school achieve- 
ment of the boys and girls is compared, or when their 
interests or general and special abilities are considered.
-P-A-G-E-27
  AIMS OF THE SURVEY 9 
The scores on the intelligence tests made by the boys 
and the girls were therefore kept separate in all the 
comparisons made in the investigation and the results 
carefully compared in order that an accurate study might 
be made of any and all sex differences that the study 
might reveal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
1. Intelligence scale used. The battery of tests used 
in this survey was the Indiana University Intelligence 
Scale, Schedule D, worked out in the Psychological Lab- 
oratory of Indiana University by S. L. Pressey, re- 
search assistant in the Department of Psychology. 
This mental examination consisted of ten separate tests 
of twenty items each: for (1) rote memory, (2) logical 
selection, (3) general arithmetical ability, (4) opposites, 
(5) logical memory, (6) word completion, (7) moral 
classification, (8) dissected sentences, (9) practical in- 
formation, and (10) analogies. This scale had been previ- 
ously verified both as to its reliability for the measurement 
of intelligence and its validity as a practical instru- 
ment for making such a mental survey as is proposed in 
the present study.? Previous to this investigation it had 
been used in a survey of the school population of an entire

Distribution among the School Population of an Indiana County,’ Pro- 
ceedings of Fifth Annual Conference on Educational Measurements, Vol. 
IV, pp. 130-169, April, 1919, published by Indiana University.

Indiana county,! and had been given to all grade and high 
school pupils in three Indiana cities. Earlier still it had 
been tried out with more than 25,000 high school and grade 
pupils in Indiana, Illinois, Colorado, Dakota, and New 
York. 
The tests were given exactly as printed in the official 
Indiana University Scale, except that the time allotted to 
the tests was reduced in order to adapt them to high school 
seniors. The first five items in Test 1 (rote memory) and 
Test 3 (arithmetical ability) were omitted. These items 
were so easy for high school seniors that they would merely 
consume time for both pupils and scorers. This reduced 
the total score that could be made on the tests to 190 points 
instead of 200, as in the original scale.? 
The blanks were changed in certain other respects so 
as to elicit information from the pupils and teachers that 
would enable us to compare the intelligence scores of high 
school seniors with certain social, economic, and educa- 
tional conditions which we desired to study. To this 
end information was obtained on the following points: 
(1) the age of the student at time of graduation; (2) the 
number of semesters spent in completing a four-year high 
school course; (3) the intention of the student to attend 
college immediately, and the name of the college selected ; 
(4) yearly income of father; (5) the father’s occupation ;

Division, Indiana University, Vol. IV, No. 4, April, 1918. 
2 These changes in time and the omission of the ten items from Tests 1 
and 3 would so modify the scores made on the tests that the results ob- 
tained in this examination should not be compared with the results 
obtained from the use of our official Schedule D.

(6) the student’s favorite study in high school; (7) the 
student’s choice of a life occupation, if made; (8) the stu- 
dent’s scholastic standing in high school in all subjects 
for the junior year. This information was obtained by 
teachers from the school records and by requesting the 
student to answer immediately, before and after taking 
the mental examination, certain questions printed on the 
test blank. Arrangements were also made with the prin- 
cipal or teacher giving the examination, to check each of 
these items on the test blanks and on the official report 
of the examination sent to the state board of education. 
Each report was signed by the teacher or principal who 
gave the examination and graded the papers, and by the 
school official who certified to the correctness of the final 
report. The original test papers were returned to the 
writer with the teachers’ reports for verification and study. 
2. Method of giving the tests. ‘The test blanks 
were distributed by Mr. O. H. Williams, then high 
school inspector for Indiana, from the office of the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Indianapolis, 
to the principal or teacher who, in response to a pre= 
vious letter, had indicated his interest in the proposed 
study and his willingness to codperate by giving the tests. 
A printed examiner’s guide accompanied by a printed 
leaflet on “The Value and Significance of Intelligence 
Tests” was sent with the test blanks to the teacher or 
principal giving the examination. The examiner’s manual 
contained instructions on the general purpose of the experi- 
ment, on the giving of intelligence tests, and on the exact 
procedure to follow in arranging for and conducting the
-P-A-G-E-31

examination. It also contained the explicit directions to 
be given to pupils in each test. It showed how to obtain 
from the pupils the general information called for on the 
blanks, and contained a complete set of rules for scoring 
the papers and for making out the special report to the 
state board of education. 
This final report was made on a specially prepared 
blank, which, when properly filled out, contained the 
name of each pupil taking the examination, his record for 
each individual test, his total score, his age at the time of 
graduation, the number of semesters spent in completing 
a four-year high school course, average scholarship record 
made during his junior year in high school, his father’s 
occupation, father’s annual income, college intention,! 
choice of a life occupation, favorite study in high school, 
etc. This information made it possible to compare the 
intelligence ratings made by various groups of students 
separately and with the state standard. It also provided 
an opportunity for verifying each item in the reports from 
each school, as the original test papers, together with all 
facts called for, were returned to the writer for reference 
and verification. 
The tests were all given during the early part of May, 
1919, and were given to all senior students of each school 
on the same day. Because of delay on the part of the 
1In the column calling for college intention the teacher or principal 
making out the report was asked to write the name of the particular 
college the pupil expected to attend if a choice had been made, the word 
“‘yes’”’ if he was going to college, but had not made a choice of college; 
the word ‘‘no”’ if he stated that he did not expect to go to college. All 
this information was contained on the pupil’s mental test blank and was 
verified by the writer.

  state board of education in arranging for the investigation, 
the blanks did not reach some of the smaller schools in 
time for them to give the examination before the end of 
the school year. But 320 commissioned high schools in 
the state gave the examination to their senior classes, 
which varied in size from 2 to 276 pupils. There were 
in these high schools a total of 6188 senior students who 
took the examination — 2477 boys and 3711 girls. Ina 
few schools the entire senior class was not present on the 
day the tests were given, but from about 98 per cent of 
these schools a 100 per cent record was obtained from their 
senior classes.!. Two large and three small high schools 
did not return their reports in time to be included in all 
tabulations. Their results were used only in making the 
comparison between communities and schools and in the 
computation of the state standard. For all other compari- 
sons made in this study the reports from only 5748 students 
were used, 2306 being boys and 3442 girls. 
8. Scope of the survey and nature of the results. 
As may be inferred from our statement of aims and the 
description of methods, the results of this investigation 
bear directly upon a number of problems far reaching in 
educational and social significance, which serve as chapter 
headings in Part II of this study. These problems may 
be briefly set forth as follows: 
(1) The general level and range of intelligence of Indi- 
ana high school seniors, shown by the range and distribu- 
tion of the scores made on the intelligence test. 
1 A check on this point was obtained by having each school report the 
total enrollment of its senior class and the number of boys and girls who 
took the examination.
-P-A-G-E-33
  MATERIALS AND METHODS 15 
(2) The intelligence of the seniors going to college, ob- 
tained by making a comparative study of the intelligence 
scores made by the seniors (a) going to college, (b) those 
not going to college, (c) those going to a liberal arts col- 
lege, (d) those going to a professional or technical col- 
lege, (e) those going to college, with no college selected. 
(8) The intelligence of seniors whom the high school 
has accelerated, retarded, or regularly promoted, obtained 
by comparing and contrasting the intelligence scores of 
those graduating from a four-year course in 6, 7, 8, 9, 
10, 11, or 12 semesters. 
(4) The intelligence of seniors who had been accelerated 
or retarded at some time during their entire school course, 
obtained by comparing the record made on the tests by 
those who graduated from high school when they were 15, 
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21 to 27 years of age. 
(5) The intelligence of seniors making an excellent 
average, or a poor scholastic record in high school, shown 
by correlating with his intelligence score the average 
scholarship record made by each student in all subjects 
studied during his junior year in high school. 
(6) The intelligence of seniors selecting different occu- 
pational careers, obtained by distributing the total group 
of seniors on the basis of the life occupations selected, and 
(a) comparing the intelligence scores made by the group 
which had selected a life occupation with the scores made 
by the group which had not, and (b) comparing the scores 
made by the groups that selected different standard occu- 
pations. 
(7) The intelligence of seniors pursuing different courses

16 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  in high school — the academic, scientific, classical, general, 
college preparatory, commercial, and vocational — ob- 
tained by comparing the intelligence rating made by sen- 
iors pursuing each of these seven courses offered by the 
high schools of the state. 
(8) The intelligence of seniors preferring different high 
school subjects, obtained by asking each senior to indicate 
his favorite study in high school, and by comparing the 
records made on the mental tests by those electing differ- 
ent subjects with each other and with the state standard. 
(9) The intelligence of seniors belonging to different 
occupational classes, obtained by distributing the intelli- 
gence scores of our total group according to the occupations 
of their fathers and comparing and contrasting with the 
state standard the intelligence ratings made by seniors 
belonging to these several occupational groups. 
(10) The intelligence of seniors coming from different 
economic strata in our society, obtained by redistributing 
our total group of seniors according to the earnings of their 
fathers and comparing the intelligence ratings made by 
those belonging to different economic groups. 
(11) The intelligence of seniors coming from different 
communities and schools, obtained by comparing the intel- 
ligence ratings of the seniors coming (a) from different 
sections of the state, i.e. the northern, central, and south- 
ern sections; (b) from different sized high schools in 
each section; (¢) from different types of communities, 7.e. 
mining, agricultural, manufacturing, and urban; (d) from 
schools situated in the most fertile and in the least pro- 
ductive sections of the state; (e) from schools of the

same size, located in the same city, county, or section of 
the state. 
(12) Important sex differences were also revealed for 
the various groups compared, by keeping separate in all 
our tabulations the records made by the boys and the 
girls. 
Each of these problems will be dealt with in Part II of 
this book, devoted to a presentation and interpretation of 
the results of the survey.

  CHAPTER III 
INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS    
       
     Tue first problem set by the survey was to ascertain by 
reliable measurement: (1) the general level of intelligence 
found among high school seniors, (2) the range of intelli- 
gence or grades of mental endowment found among this 
select group, and (3) the relative frequency with which 
various grades of intelligence occur among the individuals 
of this special group. 
1. General level of intelligence of high school seniors. 
Since it is impossible to measure absolute mental ability, 
because no intelligence scale can be constructed which will 
give us an actual zero point of intelligence to start from, 
and since any group of individuals reveal many different 
grades of mental ability, the general level of intelligence 
of any group must be measured by standards obtained 
from the group itself or by standards obtained from other 
groups of individuals whose intelligence rating is known. 
High school seniors represent a highly selected group of 
individuals who have heretofore not been measured. 
We, therefore, do not have norms from a similar group

-P-A-G-E-37
RANGE AND DISTRIBUTION 19 
with which to compare our results. Neither do we have 
norms for our scale from an unselected group of adults. 
The most reliable index of the general level of intelligence 
of this special group of individuals will, therefore, be the 
central tendency or median score made by the total group 
and the range in score for the middle 50 per cent, which 
indicates not merely the median for the total group, but 
the middle points in the distribution of scores above and 
below this median score. ; 
The median score for our total group was 137 points out 
of a possible score of 190. The median score for the boys 
was 138.9 and for the girls 135.8. The total range of 
scores extended from 40 to 187 points. The middle 50 per 
cent of the group made scores ranging from 124 to 148 
points. (See distribution curve, Figure 1.) 
2. Range of intelligence among high school seniors. 
The various grades of intelligence which high school sen- 
iors possess are indicated by the range in score above 
and below the’median for the total group, and by the 
distribution of scores above and below) this central point. 
Table I, containing-the percentile ‘scores for the entire 
group and for each sex, shows that while the median score 
is 137, 50 per cent of the students made scores between 124 
and 148 points; 10 per cent made scores above 158; 
the highest 5 per cent made scores above 164; while the 
highest 1 per cent made scores ranging from 176 to 187 
points. The poorest 10 per cent of the total group made 
scores below 111 points; the lowest 5 per cent fell below 
102; while the lowest 1 per cent made scores ranging from 
40 to 81 points.

  A clearer, and perhaps more accurate, idea of the differ- 
ent grades of mental ability possessed by these high school 
seniors may be obtained by ascertaining the percentage 
of individuals whose test scores place them in definite 
sectors of the total distribution. If we divide the total 
range of scores, above and below the median, into sectors 
of equal length and calculate the percentage of individuals 
whose test scores place them at these different levels of 
the total distribution, we secure not only an indication of 
the different grades of intelligence which our total group 
possessed, but we obtain a method which will enable us to 
determine the frequency with which each of these grades 
of intelligence occurs in our total group. If, then, some 
specific designation be given to each of these grades of 
intelligence, we have a method which enables us to compare 
any particular group of individuals with our state standard 
and with any other group. This method will also enable 
us to ascertain the extent to which these same grades of 
mental ability occur in any desired regrouping of these same 
individuals. We are enabled also to determine the rela- 
tive frequency with which these different ——.. 
gence occur in a given group, and so to draw del con-

clusions regarding their presence or absence and their rela- 
tive frequency of occurrence in any reclassified group 
which we may wish to study or compare with our state 
standard. 
With these ends in view we divided the total range of 
scores made by our total group into steps representing an

the median score for our total or standard group. A dis- 
tribution curve drawn on this basis is shown in Figure 1, 
and indicates the relative frequency with which each of 
these grades of intelligence occurred in our total group. 
To facilitate making the necessary calculations in our 
comparisons, we considered the middle sector (135 to 139 
inclusive, two points on either side of the median) as a 
separate unit, and made regular gradations above and 
below this point.

  As may be seen from an inspection of this distribution 
curve, the range in score extends farther below than above 
the median. The steps in our total distribution are, for 
sake of clearness and, ease of comparison, designated by 
the letters, A*, A, B, C*, C, C°, D, E, E, and F, begin- 
ning with the highest sector or intelligence rank and con- 
tinuing to the lowest. The score value of these steps or 
grades of ability and their relative frequency in our total 
group is shown in Figure 1. In the remaining sections of 
this report these variations in test score will, for the sake 
of convenience, be referred to as A, B, C, D, E, or F grades 
of intelligence for high school seniors, signifying the varia- 
tions in mental ability suggested by these differences in 
total score.! 
The steps in our distribution curve, above and below 
the median, are of equal length until the highest and lowest 
ranges are reached. This does not indicate, however, an 
equal amount of increase or decrease in intelligence. Our 
scale is not so constructed and cannot be so constructed 
as to give equal value to each of these sectors. The abso- 
lute value of these different grades of intelligence is un- 
known. But notwithstanding this fact, we may give them 
a label and make definite statements regarding their 
presence or frequency in any subgroup of these same 
individuals which we might desire to study and compare        
        
        
        
         
       
              
    1 These intelligence grades for high school seniors should not be con- 
fused with the intelligence ratings obtained in the army. The army 
tests were given to an unselected group of adults. Our mental tests were 
given to a highly selected group of adults. Consequently an A rating 
for high school seniors indicates an entirely different grade of general 
intelligence from an A rating obtained by the use of the army scale, asis 
explained farther on in this report,

with the state standard. The method gives us not only a 
state standard for our measurements, but a means for 
making convenient and reliable comparisons between the 
various groups of seniors which we desired to study in this 
investigation. \ 
3. Number of seniors at the various intelligence levels. 
To determine the relative frequency with which these 
different grades of intelligence occur among the individuals 
in any particular group we need only ascertain the percent- 
age belonging to the group whose test scores place them in 
standard sectors of our total distribution. These percent- 
age amounts are shown in Figure 1 and Table II.

The significance of these various grades of intelligence 
may be discerned if they are translated into terms which 
have been used to describe the variations in intelligence 
found among the members of an unselected group of adults. 
In evaluating the results obtained by the use of the army 
mental tests individuals were divided ihto the following 
seven classes:’ (1) those possessing a very superior or 
1 Compare Army Mental Tests, Washington, D. C., November, 1918, 
pp. 6-7.
-P-A-G-E-42
    24 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
“A” grade of intelligence; (2) those possessing swperior 
or “B” grade of intelligence; (3) those possessing a high 
average or “Ct” grade of intelligence; (4) those possess- 
ing only average or “C” grade of intelligence; (5) those 
possessing a low average or “C-” grade of intelligence; 
(6) those possessing an inferior or “ D” grade of intelligence ; 
(7) those possessing a very inferior or “E” grade of intelli- 
gence, depending upon the position in which the individ- 
ual’s mental test score placed him in the total range of 
scores. 
It may be further assumed, as has been determined by 
actual experiment, that individuals with very inferior 
mental ability (the lowest 8 or 10 per cent of any unselected 
group of adults) are mentally deficient, or border-line 
cases, belonging to the higher grades of feebleminded, who 
have not been committed to institutions for the mentally 
deficient. Those with inferior intelligence, the next 15 
per cent, are rarely able to go beyond the third or fourth 
grade in our elementary schools no matter how long they 
attend. Individuals with a low average or C~ grade of 
intelligence may possibly finish the elementary school 
grades, but rarely if ever go on to high school.! This 
would leave for the high school only the individuals 
who possess average (C), high average (C*), superior (B), 
and very superior or A grades of intelligence. Since 
those with only average intelligence are rarely capable 
of completing a high schocl course, we may conclude that 
the high school seniors which we tested would fall, in the 
main, in the high average, superior, and very superior

groups if measured by a standard obtained from a large 
group of wnselected adults. Those who made scores on 
our tests which place them in the lowest 5 or 10 percentile 
group would therefore possess (because they are seniors 
in high school) at least average intelligence if measured 
by a standard obtained from an unselected group of 
adults. 
The various grades of intelligence possessed by high 
school seniors must therefore be thought of as further vari- 
ations of these higher rankings of unselected adults. 
It would be helpful if we had norms for our scale from 
such an unselected group of adults with which to make 
our comparisons. It would be better still if we had an ab- 
solute scale for measuring intelligence, so that we might 
determine where in this scale of absolute values our group 
would stand between the lowest, or zero grade of intelli- 
gence, and the highest possible grade. But lacking such 
an instrument or standard, we can make comparisons in 
this report only in terms of standards obtained from our 
own selected group, remembering the probable position 
in a normal scale of distribution which this group occupies, 
and what the inequalities in mental ability possessed by 
this group really mean when translated into terms of a 
normal distribution. And since our group is composed 
exclusively of those who have successfully completed a 
high school course, we may infer that we tested only the 
equivalent of a few adults with average intelligence, and 
possibly only the best of the group possessing high average 
intelligence. The rest of our seniors, if thought of in terms 
of a standard obtained from an unselected group of adults,
-P-A-G-E-44
26 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
would doubtless possess superior and very superior grades 
of intelligence.' 
It should therefore be borne in mind, in considering the 
results of this study, that the individuals in our selected 
group whose test scores place them in the highest sectors 
of our total distribution, represent in all probability the 
very best individuals intellectually, of those who in an 
unselected group would be classed as very superior. This 
much is certain. They are the best of this original group 
of superiors as far as the high school is able to select and 
conserve them. It is the brightest individuals of this 
highly selected and in all probability specially gifted group 
that we wished especially to locate by means of this investi- 
gation so that they might be assisted and encouraged to 
continue their education in a college or university. 
1The American public schools, though the most democratic in the 
world, are, notwithstanding, a very effective selective agency, which 
tends to conserve only the best by the constant elimination of the most 
unfit individuals belonging to the total social group. This selective 
feature of our educational system is often overlooked.

CHAPTER IV 
INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
GOING TO COLLEGE 
  Onc of the original purposes of this investigation was to 
locate, by means of intelligence tests, the brightest seniors 
graduating from the high schools of the state in order that 
‘they might be encouraged and, where necessary, aided 
financially, to attend a university. In order to arrange for 
the conservation of the talents of this specially gifted 
group our first task became that of ascertaining the intelli- 
gence of the seniors who were actually planning to go to 
college, in order to see to what extent our colleges and uni- 
versities are already attracting the ablest individuals eligi- 
ble to enter higher educational institutions. 
As already stated, each student taking the intelligence 
tests was required to indicate on his test blank his exact 
college intention. In case this information was not re- 
ported, or was incomplete, the teacher giving the test ob- 
tained it privately and reported it. The tabulations were 
then made in such a way that a comparative study could 
be made of the intelligence scores of the following groups: 
(1) those definitely planning to attend a college or univer- 
sity immediately; (2) those who stated that they never 
expected to attend a college or university; (3) those who 
intended to attend college but who had not yet decided 
what college to attend; (4) those selecting an engineering

  or professional, school ;1 (5) those selecting a college of 
liberal arts. The mental tests given to all classes of men 
in the army showed that engineers rated distinctly higher 
on the army intelligence tests than did any other occupa- 
tional group. We were interested, therefore, not merely 
in ascertaining whether the brightest students graduating 
from Indiana high schools were planning to attend college, 
but in determining what sort of college they expected to 
attend. 
The distribution tables for the two groups of seniors 
mentioned first showed that when each of these groups was 
compared with our total or standard group there seemed to 
be about as many individuals among the group “going to 
college” whose test score placed them in the lower sectors 
of the distribution as there were in the group “not going 
to college”; and, conversely, there seemed to be about as 
many in the group “not going to college” whose test scores 
placed them in the higher sectors of the distribution as in 
the group who had definitely decided to attend college. 
In other words, there were individuals in both groups 
who possessed each grade of intelligence from the highest 
to the lowest. Therefore, the only way to compare ade- 
quately the intelligence of these several groups was to 
ascertain the general level of intelligence possessed by 
each group and to calculate the percentage of indi- 
viduals belonging to these several groups who possessed 
each grade of intelligence found among the individuals 
of our total or standard group.

school as well as a professional or engineering coll@g@~-»

  1. General level of intelligence of the seniors going 
to college. The general level of intelligence possessed by 
the seniors belonging to the several groups compared in 
this section is indicated, first of all, by the percentage of 
individuals belonging to each group who made scores 
on our tests above the median for our total or standard 
group. These figures, given in Table III, show that the 
seniors who were planning to attend college rank somewhat 
higher than those who stated that they never expected 
to attend. Those who had decided what college they 
would attend rank higher than those who had not 
selected their college. Those expecting to attend an 
engineering or technical school rank slightly higher than 
‘any other group.

A second indication of the general level of intelligence of 
these several groups may be obtained from a comparison 
of the percentile scores for each group. The 1, 5, 10, 25,

show (see Figure 2) that the students going to college rank 
slightly higher at all levels of ability than the group that 
did not expect to attend; that those selecting a college

intelligence than any other group; that the curve for the 
group which expected to attend college but which had not

ability, and slightly above it at the higher levels, due, no 
doubt, to the fact that many girls possessing the lower 
grades of intelligence stated that they expected to attend 
college when they meant a so-called commercial college.

telligence of these various groups is given by the data con-

  median score and record for the middle 50 per cent of the 
group planning to attend a liberal arts college is higher than 
that for any other group. The group not going to college 
ranks lowest. The other groups rank in between. The 
group which will not attend college and the group expecting 
to attend college, but not having selected their college, 
both rank below our total or standard group. 
2. Number of seniors going to college, who score at 
the various intelligence levels. The relative frequency 
with which each grade of intelligence possessed by our 
total or standard group was found among the group going 
to college, or in any of the other groups compared with 
it in this section, may be determined by calculating the 
percentage of individuals belonging to these various 
groups, whose test scores place them in the different 
standard sectors of our total distribution. From our 
distribution tables the percentage of individuals pos- 
sessing each grade of intelligence from At to F, in- 
clusive, was calculated for each of the groups compared 
in this section. These results were then expressed by 
means of curves indicating the relative frequency of 
the several grades of ability possessed by each group. 
(See Figures 4 and 5.) 
Figure 4 compares the various grades of intelligence 
possessed by the seniors going to a college of liberal arts 
with those possessed by the group not going to college. 
As may readily be seen from an inspection of these distribu- 
tion curves, the group going to colleges of liberal arts is 
distinctly superior to the group not going to college, in the 
percentage of individuals rated At, A, or B. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-51

group not going to college also has a larger proportion of 
individuals rated D, E, and F. This is shown by the 
fact that for the higher levels of ability the curve for 
the group expecting to attend a liberal arts college passes 
above the other curve, while for the lower levels of ability

    36 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
The other grades of intelligence are about equally dis- 
tributed in the two groups. 
8. College intentions of the brightest and dullest high 
school seniors found in the state. From the data 
presented in Figures 4 and 5 it appears that seniors 
possessing the higher grades of intelligence are slightly 
more likely to attend college than the seniors who 
possess the more inferior grades. This fact is strikingly 
shown in Figure 6, which pictures the percentage of seniors 
belonging to the several groups compared in this section, 
who were rated A or B and D, E, or F on the intelligence 
test. Each of our five groups is here compared with our 
state standard and with each other on the basis of the per- 
centage of students belonging to the group who were 
rated A or B and D, E, or F. Figure 7 shows the sex 
differences which occurred within each of these groups. 
These results show clearly that the brighter students 
are a little more likely to attend college than those possess- 
ing mediocre and inferior grades of mental ability ; that 
the seniors with the most superior grades of intelligence 
are slightly more likely to go to college than not to attend ; 
and that the brightest students are more likely to go to col- 
leges of liberal arts. But the very significant fact that there 
are about as many individuals of mediocre and inferior 
grades of intelligence going to college as students rated A or 
B is not emphasized by these results. 
This fact is shown in a striking manner in Figure 8. 
Figures 6 and 7 have already shown that a large percentage 
of individuals in the group not going to college are rated 
A or B and conversely, that there are almost as many
-P-A-G-E-55
  INTELLIGENCE AND COLLEGE INTENTION 37 
individuals rated D, E, or F in the groups going to college 
as seniors possessing the higher grades of ability. Figure

intelligence (A+ to F) who are (1) going to college, no 
college selected ; (2) going to a liberal arts college ; (3) go- 
ing to a professional or technical school; (4) the per-

the bars representing the group. 
4. General summary of facts. The outstanding facts 
revealed by this comparison of the intelligence scores made 
by seniors with different college intentions are the 
following : 
1. High school seniors with all grades of mental ability, 
from the lowest to the highest, are going to college in about 
equal numbers. Almost as many students possessing E 
and F grades of intelligence are going to college as merit 
a ranking of At or A. 
2. Many of the brightest students graduating from 
our high schools are not planning to go to college at all. 
Of those rated A+, 22 per cent stated they never expected 
to attend a college or university. Of those rated A, 24 
per cent did not intend to continue their education beyond 
the high school. Of those rated B, 28 per cent did not 
expect to go to college. 
3. Many students, on the other hand, with the lowest 
grades of intelligence are definitely planning to go to col- 
lege, many of them having already selected the college 
they expect to attend. Of those ranking D and E, 64 
and 62 per cent, respectively, stated that they would at- 
tend college next year. Only 78 per cent of the seniors 
ranked At stated that they were going to college. 
4. Taken as a whole the students who have decided 
to go to college rank slightly higher on the intelligence 
tests than do those who have not. Those selecting a col- 
lege of liberal arts rank higher than any other group.
-P-A-G-E-58
       40 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS     
   Those who have selected a definite college to attend rank 
higher than those who have not decided where to go. 
5. The brightest students, those rated At, A, or B, 
are slightly more likely to go to college than those whose 
test scores placed them in the middle or lower intelligence 
grades. (Compare Figures 4, 5, and 8.) 
6. The more intelligent the student the more likely he 
is to have selected the college he will attend (see shadings 
in Figure 8), and to attend a college of liberal arts. A 
greater proportion of students rated At+ or A select a 
college of liberal arts, while more students rated C+ and 
° C are planning to go to a professional or technical school, 
as may be seen by the crossing of the curves in Figure 5. 
- This fact makes the per cent of the latter group scoring 
above the state median slightly higher than for the liberal 
arts group. 
7. For every level or grade of intelligence the boys 
, /rank higher than the girls. These sex differences hold for 
all groupings made in this section. The higher the grade 
° ik intelligence the greater is the percentage of boys.

5. Discussion and interpretation of results. From the 
facts revealed in this section, it is clear that students 
with every grade of native mental endowment possessed 
by high school seniors enter our colleges and univer- 
sities each year. Moreover, there are about as many 
seniors going to college who possess mediocre grades of in- 
telligence for high school seniors, as those who possess 
the most superior grades. What quality of work should 
be expected from college students who vary so greatly
-P-A-G-E-59
  INTELLIGENCE AND COLLEGE INTENTION 41 
in mental capacity? How may intelligence tests or re- 
liable mental ratings assist college authorities in giving to 
these young people the kind of educational direction 
and guidance that they need? 
(a) Readjustments are needed. If, as we may assume, 
individuals possessing a superior or B grade of ability, 
when measured by a standard obtained from a normal 
group of unselected adults, are capable of making a good 
record in college, we may safely conclude that any high 
school senior who makes a score above the median or aver- 
age score for our total or standard group is capable, so far 
as native mental ability is concerned, of doing good work 
in college. If he makes a score very far above this 
middle point in our state standard, we may conclude that 
he has the mental capacity to do superior work as a fresh- 
man in college and should be expected to do so. 
But since the results given in this chapter clearly show 
that high school seniors with all grades of mental ability 
are planning to attend college in about equal numbers, we 
must conclude that many individuals will and do attend 
college who cannot do average or first-class work unless 
college standards are adjusted to the intellectual level of 
such students as actually attend. College authorities 
and instructors should not expect the same quantity or 
quality of work from students who vary so greatly in native 
mental endowment. They should, on the other hand, 
use the knowledge that has been obtained concerning these 
differences in intelligence and adjust their work thereto. 
One of two things might be done. If high school seniors 
possessing all grades of intelligence are admitted indis-
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH ae SENIORS 
criminately into our colleges and are definitely encouraged 
to attend, as is now the case, some arrangements should 
be made for grouping these students into classes or 
sections on the basis of mental strength so that the prob- 
lem of instruction might be facilitated and the superior 
students given the kind of opportunity and assistance 
which their special ability demands. 
Tf, on the other hand, the chief function of our colleges 
and universities is, as many believe, to train leaders for 
society in all lines of human endeavor, special provisions 
should be made for teaching these most gifted individuals, 
and providing the kind of education that is most helpful 
to them. 
(b) Practical value and need of the mental survey. Ac- 
cording to our results about 25 per cent of the students 
possessing the highest grades of intelligence found among 
high school seniors are not even thinking about attending 
college, while about 65 per cent of those possessing the 
lowest grades of mental ability are definitely planning to 
attend the higher educational institutions of the state. 
What can be done to encourage and help the former class 
to make the most of their superior mental capacities and 
talents? And how can the latter group be directed in a 
way that will enable them to find the work in life that is 
best suited to their native mental strength? It may be 
questioned whether those with only average or meager 
native mental endowment should be definitely discouraged 
from attending a college or university, but every one would 
doubtless agree that all who possess superior intelligence 
should be definitely located and given whatever help and 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
INTELLIGENCE AND COLLEGE INTENTION 43 
  encouragement is needed to induce them to continue their 
education until they are properly and fully trained. 
For the solution of this problem a mental survey would 
prove helpful in the following ways: 
(1) A state-wide mental survey of high school seniors 
would enable us to locate this superior group of young 
people and hence prepare the way for giving them such 
encouragement and help as they may need to make them 
continue their education in college. Giving those who 
actually present themselves for admission to college an 
intelligence test and using the results of such tests as a 
criterion for admission to college will never suffice, for 
the simple reason that 25 per cent of the most brilliant 
seniors in our high schools are not even thinking about 
going to college. 
(2) A little careful experimentation made in codpera- 
tion with the colleges and universities would, we believe, 
soon reveal a point on the intelligence scale below which 
students should be definitely discouraged from entering 
a university.“ The scholastic record made by former senior 
students now attending the colleges of the state is being 
investigated and correlations established between their 
intelligence scores and college grades. The next problem 
to attack is to establish a point on some practical and reli- 
able intelligence scale below which high school students 
should be definitely discouraged from entering college. 
This would tend to reduce the congestion in our universi- 
ties by limiting attendance to those who possess the men- 
tal qualities required for leadership in every field. 
(8) Such a mental survey might also be extended 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
    44 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
downward to the seventh and eighth grades to ascertain 
whether our high schools, as now organized and conducted, 
are really attracting and our elementary schools conserving 
the brightest pupils who enter the public schools. It may 
be that children with the best native mental endowment, 
for pecuniary or other reasons, are not even attending our 
high schools. The facts should be determined and proper 
adjustments made. 
(4) A mental survey is also needed if we would give 
these young people the right sort of educational and vo- 
cational guidance in high school and college. One of the 
greatest social wastes to-day is due to the fact that so many 
men and women, because of present economic conditions 
or lack of proper direction, are engaged in occupations far 
beneath their level of ability, while others are attempting 
work too complex for their mental strength. Both groups 
are made unhappy and inefficient by the maladjustment. 
In our educational work we are ignoring most of these 
facts. Much of our work is too general and aimless to be 
effective. And a bad condition is made worse when we 
attempt to train young people in professional and voca- 
tional schools for careers wholly unsuited to their mental 
strength. Systematic mental surveys would do much to 
correct such social wastes. If such surveys were made of 
the workers now engaged in standard occupations, they 
would soon reveal the level of intelligence which successful 
workers in every field actually possess. This would pro- 
vide norms that would give us at least a starting point 
for the effective vocational and educational guidance of 
youth.
-P-A-G-E-63
INTELLIGENCE AND COLLEGE INTENTION 46 
(5) Systematic mental surveys would also help us to 
determine why students with superior intelligence often 
do only average or mediocre work in high school and college 
and sometimes fail in life, while students with only average 
intelligence often succeed. They would also soon get us 
in the habit of not expecting an ‘A’ grade of school work 
from students possessing an E or F grade of intelligence 
and would make us adapt the work of the high school and 
college better to the marked inequalities in mental ability 
found among our students. 
Other values of the mental survey will be pointed out 
in Chapter XVI.

INTELLIGENCE OF SENIORS WHO HAVE) BEEN 
ACCELERATED, RETARDED, AND REGULARLY 
PROMOTED BY THE SCHOOL 
Wirs the discovery that marked individual differences 
exist among children of the same age or children belonging 
to the same school grade (differences in endurance or vital 
capacity, in native mental endowment, in the number and 
kind of special mental abilities possessed) there has grown 
up a widespread belief that progress in learning should 
take place in direct proportion to the native mental endow- 
ment which a given individual or group of individuals 
possesses; that educational accomplishment should be 
commensurate with intelligence or at least be measured in 
terms of the native mental endowment of the child or 
group whose school achievement is being measured. A 
number of psychologists are attempting to devise methods 
whereby this may be successfully done.! 
On this theory we would naturally expect the schools of 
the state, if they had been truly successful and efficient 
in their work, to have accelerated the brightest seniors or 
those with the best mental endowment; to have retarded

those possessing the most inferior grades of intelligence ; 
and to have promoted regularly all those who possess only 
average mental ability. In the light of these develop- 
ments we desired to determine by this investigation the 
extent to which the high schools of the state were adjusting 
themselves to the inequalities in mental strength actually 
found among their students. We were particularly inter- 
ested in the following four problems which will be consid- 
ered in detail in this chapter : 
1. Are the high schools of the state accelerating as 
many students as our intelligence tests indicate that they 
should? 
2. Are they able to locate the brightest students and 
to make adequate provision for their proper advancement ? 
That is to say, are the best mentally endowed students 
permitted to complete their high school course as rapidly 
as they can and should? Do the high schools of the state 
retard only such students as rank, in general intelligence, 
below the average for our total or standard group, and do 
they promote regularly only those who possess average © 
mental ability when judged by this standard? 
3. Which is succeeding better in adapting its organiza- 
tion and work to the mental inequalities and interests of 
its pupils, the elementary school or the high school? 
4. Is the high school adapting itself in all these respects 
as well to the interests and needs of the boys as to those of 
the girls? : 
To obtain data that would make it possible to answer 
these questions, information was secured from each stu- 
dent regarding his age at time of graduation, and the num-  
-P-A-G-E-66

ber of semesters he had spent in completing his four-year 
high school course. These statements were afterwards 
verified by the teacher giving the examination and in 
most cases by the high school principal, who provided in 
addition to this information the average scholastic grade 
made by each senior in all subjects studied during his jun- 
ior year. The tabulations of the mental test scores were 
then made in such a way that the intelligence scores made 
by the students who were accelerated or retarded in high 
school could be compared with the scores made by the 
group that had been regularly promoted and with our 
state standard. 
1. Number of students accelerated, retarded, and 
normally advanced by the school. The first problem was 
to ascertain whether there were as many pupils in the 
senior classes of Indiana high schools who had been ac- 
celerated, retarded, and normally advanced in school as 
the inequalities in intelligence revealed by this study 
would lead us to expect. The number accelerated or 
retarded during their high school course, and the num- 
ber normally advanced, are shown by the number of 
semesters each student required to complete his high school 
course. Some completed a four-year course in six semesters 
or three years, others required ten or twelve semesters to 
graduate. Most seniors completed the course in normal 
time, or eight semesters. The exact situation with regard 
to the seniors who took the mental tests is shown in 
Table IV, which gives the per cent of our total group who 
were (1) accelerated, (2) retarded, and (3) regularly 
advanced by the high school. If they graduated in six or
-P-A-G-E-67
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 49 
seven semesters, they were judged accelerated; if they 
required nine or more semesters to complete a four-year 
course, they were judged retarded; if they graduated in 
eight semesters, they were considered as regularly pro- 
moted in high school.

sidered that a senior had normal school standing through- 
out the high school and grades if he had completed the 
work of the eight grades and four years of high schoolin 
twelve years, graduating from high school at 18. Those 
seniors, therefore, who graduated at 15, 16, or 17 were 
counted as accelerated in their total school standing 
from 1 to 3 years. Those graduating when they were 
19, 20, 21, 22, or more years of age were counted as re- 
tarded 1 to 4 years.!_ Where or how the time was lost we 
cannot tell. The table gives the per cent of our total 
number who belonged to each of these groups.

1This does not, of course, take into account the fact that some of the 
seniors accelerated one or more years in their school standing may have 
been taught at home before starting to school and so gained a grade or 
two outside of school, or that others may have lost a year or more or 
account of illness. It is believed, however, that the method gives a fair 
measure of the amount of retardation and acceleration which occurred 
among the group of students tested.

2. Number of seniors with superior, average, and in- 
ferior intelligence. The percentage of students who 
made superior, average, and inferior scores on the mental 
tests is shown in Table VIII. As said before, a mental 
rating of At or A indicates very superior; B superior; 
Ct or C and C~ high average, average,.and low average, 
respectively; D and E low and inferior; E- and F very 
inferior intelligence for high school seniors.

52 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
According to this method of ranking, 22 per cent of all 
seniors tested possessed very superior or superior intelli- 
gence; 52 per cent possessed average intelligence; and 26 
per cent possessed inferior or very inferior grades of intelli- 
gence for high school seniors. 
It therefore appears that there were fewer students 
retarded during their school career than were ranked 
D, E, or F on the mental tests. Only 20.3 per cent of the 
boys and 16.6 per cent of the girls were retarded, while 
26 per cent ranked D, E, or F on our tests. On the other 
hand, there were more students accelerated one or more 
years in their total school standing than were ranked A or 
B on our tests. Of the total group giving information on 
this point, 42 per cent had saved one or more years during 
their entire school course, while only 22 per cent earned an 
intelligence rating of A or B on the tests. If we add to 
this number the students belonging to the C+ group (most 
of the students accelerated made scores on our mental tests 
which gave them a C+ rating), we get a percentage figure 
(44) which practically equals the number that were 
advanced by the school more rapidly than normal. That 
is to say, 42 per cent of our total group were accelerated 
at some time during their entire school course; 44 per 
cent made scores of A, B, or Cton the mental tests. About 
40 per cent of our total group had been regularly advanced 
throughout their entire school course, but only 30 per cent 
of our total group obtained a mental rating of C or C- on 
the tests. If we add to this number all those rated D, 
we would have 43 per cent, which comes within 3 per cent 
of the number promoted regularly each year.
-P-A-G-E-71
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 53 
  It seems, therefore, that most of the high average group 
(those ranked C+) have been accelerated at some time dur- 
ing their public school career, while all rated C and C~ and 
practically all of those rated D have been normally 
advanced. We may conclude that the number of individ- 
uals who have been accelerated, retarded, and normally 
advanced by the elementary schools corresponds, at least 
roughly, to the number ranking as superior, average, or 
inferior in general intelligence. 
But the figures for the high school are very different. 
Here only 5.85 per cent have been accelerated, 90.34 per 
cent have been normally advanced, while only 3.78 per 
cent have been retarded during their high school course. 
(See Table IV.) But 22 per cent of these same individuals 
made an A or B rating on the mental tests; 52 per cent 
were rated C+, C, or C~ (high average, average, or low 
average); and 26 per cent made a D, FE, or F (inferior) 
rating on the mental tests. If we assume that those who 
made an intelligence rating of C+ and over are capable 
of being accelerated (most of those who were accelerated 
in high school made an intelligence rating of C+) and that 
those rated D were capable of making normal progress, 
~ we would have 44 per cent who should have completed 
the course in less than normal time; 43 per cent in normal 
or average time; and 13 per cent in more than four years. 
Over against this we have the actual records for senior 
classes which show that less than 6 per cent were actually 
permitted to complete their high school course in less than 
normal time; less than 4 per cent were retarded, while 
90 per cent were kept on the course a full four years. 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
54 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  That is to say, more than twice as many seniors were kept 
on their course a full four years as the intelligence scores 
indicate should be regularly promoted. About seven times 
as many made an intelligence rating indicating that they 
should be accelerated as were permitted to shorten their 
high school course, and less than one-third as many were 
actually retarded as our intelligence records indicate that 
there should be. 
It appears, therefore, that the high school is not adapt- 
ing itself to the inequalities in native mental endowment 
of its students as well as it should, nor as well as the ele- 
mentary school. We must conclude either that other 
factors besides intelligence play an important réle in pro- 
ducing school success and that these factors act more rig- 
idly in the high school than in the elementary school ; that 
our tests do not give us an adequate measure of the native 
mental endowment of these students; or that many 
students are working far below their best standard of 
attainment in high school and so are acquiring habits of 
laziness or inefficiency because their superior ability is not 
recognized and the work of the school adapted to their 
mental strength and needs. Our scale has been thoroughly 
tested and found reliable; hence we must look to the other 
two factors for an explanation of these facts. 
3. Intelligence of seniors whom the school accelerated, 
retarded, and regularly promoted. Our second purpose in 
making these comparisons was to ascertain the grade of 
intelligence possessed by the seniors actually accelerated, 
retarded, and regularly promoted by the school. We 
wished to know whether our high schools are accelerating
-P-A-G-E-73
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 55 
  their brightest students, holding back or failing only such 
pupils as are below average in intelligence, and promoting 
regularly those whose intelligence is average when com- 
pared with the general level of ability of our total or 
standard group. To collect data which would bear di- 
rectly on this problem, we tabulated our results so that 
we might study separately those accelerated, retarded, 
and normally advanced by the school. We shall there- 
fore attempt to determine (1) the general level of in- 
telligence possessed by each of these groups, (2) the pro- 
portion of individuals belonging to each group who 
possess various grades of intelligence, and (3) the extent 
to which the schools actually select the brightest students 
for special advancement and retard or fail those with in- 
ferior mentality.

  students accelerated by the school, if taken as a group, 
rank consistently higher than those retarded or only regu-

A better idea of the general level of intelligence of 
these several groups may be gained from Figure 9, which
-P-A-G-E-75
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 57 
  shows the record made on the mental tests by the middle 
50 per cent of the seniors belonging to each semester and 
age group. The horizontal bars in this figure indicate the 
record made by the middle 50 per cent of individuals be- 
longing to the several age and semester groups. The 
vertical cross-bars show the median score for each group. 
The figure shows very clearly how far superior in central 
tendency the students are who completed their high 
school course in 6 or 7 semesters, or graduated from high 
school when only 15, 16, or 17 years of age. It shows also 
how far below the state standard the groups fall who 
were retarded in their total school standing one or more 
years.! 
It should also be pointed out that the groups accelerated 
by the school are superior at every level of ability to the 
groups retarded or only normally advanced. This is 
shown by the percentile curves presented in Figures 10 and 
11. That is to say, the seniors belonging to the acceler- 
ated groups making scores which place them in the lower 
sectors of our total distribution do not fall quite so low on 
the tests as do the individuals belonging to the retarded 
group. In fact, they rank higher for every percentile 
level than either the normal or retarded group. And the 
result is the same no matter whether we compare those 
accelerated in the high school (the semester groups) or 
1It might be stated in this connection that Mr. Rice, whose study of 
the correlation between intelligence rating and average school marks is 
described in the next chapter, found a negative correlation between intel-

curves, the group graduating at 16 is distinctly superior
-P-A-G-E-80
62 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  to both other groups in the percentage of individuals be- 
longing to the group who possess the higher grades of 
ability. This curve is higher at all points representing 
the A+, A, B, and C+ grades of intelligence and lower 
at all points indicating the lower grades of mental ability. 
The curve for the normal or average group passes about 
midway between the other two curves at every point but 
one. 
Figure 13 shows the distribution of all grades of ability 
for the seniors graduating at the ages of 15 and 20 respec- 
tively. The striking feature of these curves is the large 
proportion of students graduating at 15 who possess a 
superior or B grade of intelligence, and the correlative 
fact that the largest percentage of seniors graduating at 
the age of 20 possess only a C-, D, or E grade of intelli- 
gence. 
The data and curves for all the age and semester groups 
can, of course, not be given in this report. But the data 
for each of these groups was prepared and curves drawn 
for comparative study. These data show that the fre- 
quency curves for the various semester groups have the 
same general tendencies shown by the curves for the age 
groups presented in Figures 12 and 13. If we combine the 
results for all groups accelerated or retarded in the high 
school or elementary grades, we get the results shown in 
Figures 14 and 15 below. Figure 14 gives the record for 
all seniors accelerated, retarded, and regularly advanced 
in high school. It shows the percentage belonging to each 
group who possessed each grade of intelligence from the 
highest to the lowest. Figure 15 gives similar data for the

   seniors who were accelerated, retarded, and regularly pro-

We may, therefore, conclude that the seniors who have

The data also show that the greater the acceleration or

The most significant facts revealed by our comparative 
study of these several groups are, however, not brought

especially interested in knowing whether the schools are 
succeeding in selecting their brightest students for special 
advancement, and if it is the dullest pupils who are being 
retarded by the school.

seen there is a regular gradation downwards from the group 
graduating in 6 semesters to the group requiring 10 or 12 
semesters to complete a four-year high school course, in- 
dicating that the groups accelerated by the high school, if

the brighter do they seem to be. 
Figure 17 presents the results of a similar comparison 
made of the several age groups and shows that the group 
of seniors graduating at the age of 15 has a much larger 
percentage of students ranking A or B on the intelligence 
tests, and a smaller percentage ranking D, E, or F, than 
are found in our total or standard group; that it is de- 
cidedly superior to the group graduating at 16, while the 
latter group is superior in both respects to the group grad- 
uating at the age of 17, and so on down the list to theoldest 
or most retarded group. 
(d) Brightest seniors are not accelerated. If, however, 
we push our comparisons one step further, we get a dif- 
ferent story. The range in score for the group normally 
advanced by the school extends much higher on the intelli- 
gence scale than did the scores for the students who had 
been accelerated. That is to say, the brightest students in 
last year’s graduating classes are not found among the 
group which the school accelerated, but among the group 
which had been only regularly promoted. A large per- 
centage of these brightest seniors are even found among 
those only normally advanced throughout their entire

school course. In other words, neither in the high school 
nor in the elementary grades were these brightest students 
located and advanced more rapidly than the normal rate of 
promotion. Our distribution tables also revealed the fact 
that some seniors accelerated from one to three years in 
their total school standing possessed only average and at 
times very inferior grades of intelligence. On the other 
hand, most of the seniors accelerated by the schools rank 
only Ct in the intelligence tests. 
Taking as an example the group of seniors who possess 
a very superior grade of intelligence (the A* group), we 
find that less than 6 per cent of this group were acceler- 
ated by the high school; 90 per cent were only normally 
advanced ; while 3 per cent were actually retarded.. On the 
other hand, of the total number accelerated by the school 
only 2 per cent possess an A+ grade of intelligence; 30 
per cent a high average or C+ grade of intelligence; 
the rest received a low average or inferior intelligence rating 
on our tests. (Compare Figure 14, page 63.) 
A similar tendency is found, though not so marked, 
among those accelerated, retarded, and regularly promoted 
in the elementary schools. And it appears that the bright- 
est students are more consistently selected for double pro- 
motion in the elementary schools. These and other facts 
are presented in detail in Tables X and XI below and Fig- 
ures 14 and 15, pages 63 and 64. 
Table X divides our total group of seniors into three 
classes: (1) those accelerated by the high school, (2) the 
per cent normally advanced, and (3) the per cent retarded 
from one to four semesters. It shows the percentage pos-

From a study of the table it may readily be seen that 
most individuals possessing superior and very superior 
grades of intelligence are required to spend four years on 
their high school course; that only a few of the ablest 
seniors have been accelerated, while a few possessing the 
most superior grades of intelligence have been actually 
retarded. Only about 6 and 7 per cent, respectively, of 
those possessing an At or A grade of ability were advanced 
more rapidly than normal during their high school course ; 
about 91 and 89 per cent were normally advanced, 7.e. 
were kept in high school eight full semesters to complete 
their course; while 3 and 4 per cent were actually retarded 
one or more semesters. And what seems just as astound- 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
70 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  ing and paradoxical is the fact that about 3 per cent of the 
pupils rated E, and 14 per cent of the seniors rated F, were 
accelerated one or more semesters in high school; 93 and 
97 per cent of those possessing these lowest grades of intelli- 
gence were regularly promoted; while only about 4 and 
14 per cent were retarded one or more semesters.1 (See 
Table X, page 69.) 
Table XI gives similar data for the seniors who were 
(1) accelerated, (2) retarded, and (3) normally advanced 
throughont their entire school course. Here we get a 
somewhat different story. Of the students accelerated 
at some time during their entire school course, 67 and 61 
per cent possess an At or A grade of intelligence. Only 
5 and 8 per cent of this group of superiors were retarded 
at some time during their entire school career; 28 and 
31 per; cent were regularly promoted. A much larger 
percentage (29, 17,and 24 per cent) of the individuals 
accelerated at some time during their entire school course 
fall into the lowest intelligence ranks (E and F), showing 
that relatively more individuals with inferior intelligence 
are doubly promoted in the elementary grades. It is also 
worthy of note that there is a regular decline in the per- 
centage belonging to the accelerated group as we pass from 
the highest to the lowest grades of mental ability, and con- 
versely for the retarded group, showing that the elemen- 
tary school is in general promoting the brighter students. 
(See Table XI.) 
1 It may be argued that all those who are admitted to advanced stand- 
ing are capable mentally of being regularly promoted. If this be the case, 
what shall we say about the most superior seniors in the state who are 
only regularly promoted?

From the facts already presented in Figures 14 and 15 
above, it may be seen that aside from the facts just 
presented there is little difference in the type of student 
which the schools elect for acceleration. In both the 
high and elementary schools more students possessing a B 
or C grade of intelligence are accelerated than belong to 
any other intelligence rank. The elementary school seems 
to accelerate a few more students rated A than does the 
high school. But it also seems to retard more students 
possessing superior intelligence than does the high school. 
With these exceptions the tables show the same general 
tendencies, which may be briefly summarized as follows: 
1. Individuals of all grades of ability from the highest 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
72 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
to the lowest are accelerated, retarded, and normally 
promoted by both the high and elementary school. 
2. A larger percentage of individuals belonging to the 
higher grades of intelligence are accelerated by both than 
are retarded, and conversely, most individuals retarded 
possess a low average or inferior grade of intelligence. 
3. But a large majority of the seniors accelerated pos- 
sess only average or high average intelligence. 
4, The brightest seniors are not selected for accelera- 
tion. 
5. All these facts hold, though in varying degrees, for 
both the high school and elementary school. 
4. Sex differences. Three of the four questions raised 
by the data presented in this chapter have now been 
answered. The schools, particularly the high schools, 
are not accelerating as many of their students as the 
intelligence tests indicate that they should. They are 
promoting only regularly many students. who should be 
accelerated, if our mental test scores may be taken 
as a criterion of the success that should be attained 
in school. Moreover, the brightest seniors were never 
accelerated and the high school is not adapting itself as 
well to the inequalities in the mental strength of its pupils 
asisthe elementary school. Our fourth question, whether 
the high school is adapting itself as well to the mental 
capacities and interests of the boys as to the girls, is an- 
swered by the facts revealed by our comparative study of 
the intelligence ‘scores of the boys and girls who were 
actually accelerated, retarded, and regularly promoted by 
the school.

As was shown in Chapters IT and III the boys who took 
our mental tests made consistently higher scores than did 
the girls. They showed every indication of possessing 
grades of mental ability superior to that possessed by the 
girls who took our mental tests. We would therefore 
expect them to have been more rapidly advanced by the 
school than were the senior girls.

gence possessed by these several groups. Figure 20 com- 
pares the boys and girls graduating from high school in 6, 7, 
8, 9, and 10 semesters, on the basis of the percentage belong- 
ing toeach group who possess the highest, or A and B grades 
of intelligence, and the lowest, or D, E, and F grades. 
It shows that a much larger percentage of the boys acceler- 
ated in high school are rated A or B (53 and 33 per cent 
respectively) than girls (27 and 19 per cent respectively). 
This difference in favor of the boys is out of all proportion 
to the slight superiority in mental ability that has been 
shown by them throughout the study. 
The same superiority of the boys appears if we com- 
pare the per cent of boys and girls making scores above the 
state median. This was 86 and 62 per cent respectively 
for the boys graduating in 6 and 7 semesters, and only 66 
and 60 per cent for the girls. The reason that the differ- 
ence is less for the 7-semester group is obviously due to 
the fact that in this comparison were included all those 
who made a ranking of C+ on the tests, the grade of intelli- 
gence possessed by most of the girls accelerated by the 
school. 
The same point is brought out in a negative way if we 
examine the record made on the tests by the boys and girls 
who were retarded in high school. Of the group of boys 
kept in high school 10 or more semesters to complete their 
four-year course, 20.58 per cent made an intelligence rating 
of Aor B. Among the girls requiring an equal amount of 
time to complete their high school course none made a score 
on the mental tests which entitled them to an A or B intel- 
ligence rating, but 58 per cent of this same group of girls
-P-A-G-E-95

merited an intelligence rating of D, E, or F, as contrasted 
with only 20 per cent for the boys. (Compare Figure 18.)

  their entire school course, namely, those graduating at the 
age of 15 and 20, or 21-27, we find little difference between 
the percentage of boys and girls that made the highest, 
A or B, and the lowest, D, E, or F, intelligence rating. 
(See Figure 21, page 77.) 
Frequency curves, showing the percentage of boys and 
girls belonging to the several age and semester groups who 
possess each grade of ability from At to F, reveal the 
fact that the girls who required 10 or more semesters to 
graduate from high school are decidedly inferior in mental 
ability to the boys retarded an equal time in their high 
school work. For example, none of the girls requiring 10 
semesters to graduate made a mental rating above C-. 
The entire group made scores which gave them a C-, D, 
E, or F intelligence rating. The case is quite different for 
the boys. The boys who spent 10 or more semesters in 
high school made scores on our mental tests which placed 
them at every level of mental ability. \In other words if a 
girl is retarded in high school, we may conclude, on the basis 
of our results, that she possesses inferior mental ability. 
This is not the case for the boys. Many boys who have 
been retarded possess superior grades of ability] (Com- 
pare also the 10-semester groups in Figure 18 already re- 
ferred to.) 
If we compare the various age groups, we get a different 
result. For example, we have about the same percentage 
of boys as girls graduating at the ages of 15 (three years 
accelerated) and 19 (one year retarded) who made scores 
giving them an intelligence rating of A or B. Chhis would 
seem to indicate that the high school work is not so well
-P-A-G-E-97
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 79 
  adapted to the interests and needs of the boys as to the 
girls] 
If further evidence were needed to establish this point, 
it may be found in the fact that the(girls accelerated in 
their high school course made a much lower rating on the 
mental tests than did the boys who were thus accelerated. 
Of the girls graduating in six semesters 11.37 per cent 
made an intelligence rating of D, E, or F, while only 4.76 
per cent of the boys in the corresponding group were 
rated aslow. (See Figure 18 above.) But notwithstand- 
ing these facts more girls than boys were accelerated by 
the school. Some other reason besides native mental 
endowment must be found to account for the fact that the 
girls were more rapidly advanced by the school than the 
boys. 
That the cause for this ill adjustment lies in the high 
school rather than in the elementary school is shown by 
the fact that the same general tendencies described above 
for the high school or semester groups are found in the age 
groups, but to a smaller degree. The boys in the various 
age groups are still superior to the girls, both in intelli- 
gence (compare age groups in Figures 18 and 19) and in the 
frequency with which they are found among the groups 
possessing the higher grades of ability. (Compare Figures 
20 and 21 and the frequency curves in Figures 22 and 23.) 
But when we compare the several age and semester groups 
in both these respects we find that the differences in favor 
of the boys are much greater for the semester groups 
(those accelerated and retarded by the high school) than 
for those who are accelerated and retarded by the elemen-

this study are distinctly brighter than the girls, the latter 
have been advanced more rapidly by the high schools. 
From the records covering the entire 12-year period that _ 
our seniors were in school, we find that 43 per cent of the 
girls were accelerated by the school while 40 per cent of the 
boys were accelerated. We also find more boys retarded, 
20.3 per cent of the boys as against 16.6 per cent of the
-P-A-G-E-100
82 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
girls. This is what we should expect, since the girls in 
the elementary schools make higher intelligence scores 
than the boys and since the boys accelerated and retarded 
by the elementary schools show less superiority over the 
girls than those accelerated and retarded in the high school. 
In the high school the situation is just the reverse. We 
still have a larger percentage of girls accelerated than boys 
(6.13 per cent of girls and only 5.5 per cent of the boys) 
and a larger per cent of the boys retarded. But here the 
boys make distinctly and consistently higher scores on the 
intelligence tests than the girls. It would, therefore, ap- 
pear that the high school is adapting itself better to the 
interests and needs of the girls than the boys, and is not 
adapting itself as well to the inequalities in mental strength 
of either sex as is the elementary school. 
We must conclude either that the high school work is 
better adapted to the interests and needs of the girls, 
that the girls are more conscientious and persistent about 
their high school work, and therefore more successful, or 
that our tests are better adapted to the boys. That the 
latter is not the case has been shown by the results obtained 
by giving the same tests to many thousands of school chil- 
dren in several states. In the grades below the high school 
the girls have been consistent in making scores on the same 
mental tests which are distinctly higher than the scores 
made by the boys for every school grade and every age 
up to 14.4

We are not interested here in the probable cause of the 
sex differences in the elementary grades or in the high 
school, but in the fact that senior boys in high school rank 
consistently higher in intelligence than the girls, while the 
girls, notwithstanding this fact, have been advanced more 
consistently and rapidly by the high school than the boys. 
5. General summary of facts. Summarizing the more 
important facts revealed by the entire chapter, we may 
note the following: 
1. The elementary school is doubly promoting about 
as many individuals as our study would lead us to expect. 
Forty per cent of the boys and 43 per cent of the girls tak- 
ing our tests have been advanced by the school more rap- 
idly than normal. Twenty per cent of the boys and 17 
per cent of the girls have been retarded ; 40 per cent have 
been regularly promoted. Of these same seniors 44 per 
cent made a superior rating on our tests; 43 per cent made 
an average rating; 13 per cent made an inferior rating. 
This is about what we should expect from the inequal- 
ities in mental strength which our tests have revealed. 
Whether or not the elementary schools are promoting 
these students as rapidly as their mental ability warrants, 
we cannot tell. 
2. The high school, on the other hand, is ‘accelerating 
fewer students than our study indicates that it should. 
Only 5.5 per cent of the boys and 6.13 per cent of the girls 
were accelerated at any time during their high school 
course; 90 and 91 per cent respectively were regularly 
promoted ; 4.5 per cent of the boys and 3.28 per cent of the 
girls were retarded. Of these same individuals 22 per
-P-A-G-E-102
84 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
cent made scores on our tests which entitled them to an 
intelligence rating of A or B, indicating a superior grade of 
native mental endowment; 52 per cent made an intelli- 
gence rating of C, indicating average intelligence for high 
school seniors; 26 per cent made an intelligence rating of 
D, E, or F, indicating an inferior grade of intelligence. 
3. That the school is succeeding to a considerable ex- 
tent in adapting its work to the inequalities in mental 
strength found among its pupils is shown by the fact that 
the seniors who were advanced more rapidly than normal, 
in either the high school or elementary grades ranked, 
when taken as a group, consistently higher on the mental 
tests than did the seniors who were retarded or only nor= 
mally advanced. It is also true that the greater the accel- 
eration or retardation the brighter or duller does the group 
seem to be. 
4. In this respect the high school is, however, not suc- 
ceeding as well as the elementary school. In the elemen- 
tary school 42 per cent of our total group were accelerated 
from one to three years at some time during their entire 
school course; 44 per cent made a superior and high aver- 
age intelligence rating on the mental tests. In the high 
school only 5.85 per cent of our total group of seniors fin- 
ished their high school course in less than normal time, 
while about 91 per cent were regularly promoted and 4 per 
cent retarded. 
5. The brightest seniors in our total list were never 
selected for acceleration, either by the high school or in the 
elementary grades. Seniors with high average or slightly 
superior intelligence were advanced more rapidly than
-P-A-G-E-103
  INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 85 
normal, in largest numbers. None of the seniors who made 
an intelligence rating which placed them in the highest 
one percentile group were found in any of the accelerated 
groups. The most gifted individuals had either not been 
located by the school or if discovered were not permitted 
to complete their course in less than normal time. Most 
of the students accelerated made intelligence scores which 
gave them a mental'rating of C+ or B. 
6. Most individuals possessing superior or very superior 
intelligence have been only regularly promoted by the 
high school. Only a few have been accelerated, while 
some of these superior individuals have been actually re- 
tarded. Of the seniors who possessed an At or A grade 
of ability only 6 and 7 per cent respectively were advanced 
more rapidly than normal in the high school; 91 and 90 
per cent of this same group were only normally advanced, 
while 3 and 4 per cent of these superior students were ac- 
tually retarded one or more semesters while completing 
their high school course. 
7. Most high school seniors possessing inferior grades 
of intelligence (93 to 97 per cent) have been regularly 
promoted in high school, while a few belonging to this in- 
ferior group (2 to 3 per cent) have been actually accel- 
erated. 
8. The high school seems also better adjusted to the 
interests and needs of the girls. The boys taken asa whole 
ranked decidedly higher on the intelligence tests than did 
the girls, but notwithstanding this fact, the girls have been 
more rapidly promoted in high school than the boys, and 
more boys than girls have been retarded. The boys
-P-A-G-E-104
       
          i 
6 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
accelerated by the school made a decidedly and con- 
sistently higher rating on the mental tests than did the 
- girls who were accelerated. Twice as many boys accel- 
erated in high school made an intelligence rating of A or 
B as did the girls who were advanced more rapidly than 
normal. Many girls, on the other hand, with an inferior 
intelligence rating were accelerated. Of the girls graduat- 
ing in three years 11.36 per cent made a D, E, or F rating 
on the tests. The boys retarded by the high school are 
much brighter than the girls who failed of promotion. 
Many boys with superior ability (21 per cent) were found 
in the group retarded from one to three years. No girls 
with superior ability or even with high average ability 
were found in the retarded group. If a girl is retarded in 
high school, we may, on the basis of our test results, assume 
that she possesses inferior intelligence. In fact, 58 per 
cent of the girls retarded in high school made anintelligen 
rating of only D, E, or F. diy 
9. That the ill adjustment is greater in the high school 
than in the elementary school is shown by the fact that in 
the elementary grades only a few more girls than boys 
are accelerated and a few more boys than girls retarded. 
, Here the girls are consistent in making higher grades on 
the mental tests. But in the high school the situation is 
reversed. We still have more girls than boys accelerated, 
and more boys retarded, but here the boys who remain 
to graduate make distinctly higher records on the intelli- 
gence tests than do the girls. | 
6. Discussion and interpretation of results. The 
above comparisons of the intelligence ratings of the a 
o ‘ ie 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
  INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 87 
students accelerated, retarded, and normally promoted 
by the school show clearly that the high schools of the 
state are not adapting themselves to the inequalities in 
native mental strength of their students as well as they 
should; |that they are accelerating too few students; 
that the teachers and school officials do not select the most 
intelligent students for such special advancement; that 
the brightest students in the state are not being selected 
either by the high school or in the grades for acceleration ; 
and lastly that those selected for special advancement 
possess only a high average grade of intelligence. Sum- 
marizing the results of all tables and figures in this 
chapter, we find that more than twice as many of our 
seniors were kept on their course four years as possessed 
an average grade of intelligence for high school seniors. 
About seven times as many possessed a very superior 
de of intelligence as were permitted to shorten their 
course. And less than one-third of the group possessing 
very inferior grades of general intelligence were actually 
retarded by the high school. 
We must conclude either that the high schools are not 
adapting themselves adequately to the inequalities in 
mental strength found among their students, or that other 
factors besides intelligence play an important réle in pro- 
ducing school success and that these factors act more rig- 
idly in the high school than in the elementary school. 
On the face of our results it appears that many students in 
high schools are working far below their best standard 
of attainment, and so are acquiring habits of laziness and 
inefficiency because their work is ill adapted to their 
   
-P-A-G-E-106
  88 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
mental strength and needs. - We need to determine more 
accurately than has ever been done the causes for success 
and failure in school —to determine why the brighter 
students are not selected by the school for special advance- 
ment and why students who are known to be superior in 
native mental endowment are not advanced more rapidly 
during their high school career. It seems to be a habit of 
high school officials to keep their students in high school 
for four years regardless of their ability to do the work, 
suggesting that in many cases habits of working far below 
the best level of attainment are being formed by these su- 
perior students, which will serve as a permanent handicap. 
‘he writer has in mind the case of a mathematical 
genius who was kept in high school four long years when he 
clearly could have completed the work in 23 or 3 years’ 
time without injury to his health, and doubtless with psy- 
chological profit to himself] He made high grades in 
every study. No problem in mathematics could be 
found by his teacher that he could not solve almost at 
sight. He had to work on his assignments so little that 
he was idle most of the time. That this enforced idleness 
did not ruin the boy cannot be placed to the credit of the 
school. He was merely content to busy himself with his 
own interests and with mathematical musings during his 
leisure time. In due time he graduated from high school 
and entered a university, where he finished in two years 
all the courses in mathematics offered. He graduated in 
less than three years, and in his post graduate work this 
record was maintained. It appears that his genius and 
special interest in mathematics saved him from falling a
-P-A-G-E-107
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 89 
prey to slovenly habits of work and kept him from losing 
his native interest for mathematics and school. It also 
kept him from developing habits of mental laziness, which 
might have been acquired. We can only speculate in 
regard to how much time was actually lost to the boy and 
the injury that is done to most bright boys and girls by 
the situation in our high schools revealed by the facts 
presented above. 
In order to speed up the necessary military training in 
the army and to conserve to the fullest extent all grades of 
mental ability and skill possessed by enlisted men, the 
divisions of the army were organized, so far as possible, 
on the basis of equal mental strength. In this manner 
it was demonstrated that the necessary military training 
could be greatly speeded up. This was particularly the 
case in the officer’s training camps where those with supe- 
rior grades of intelligence were separately grouped and 
their tasks and training adjusted to their capacity to learn. 
How far the high schools fall short of such an organiza- 
tion, calculated to conserve the talents of individuals 
with all grades of native mental ability by adjusting their 
work to their interests and native mental strength, is 
clearly indicated by the facts presented in this chapter. 
“We should learn to evaluate school achievement and to 
measure progress in learning in terms of mental capacity ; 
that is to say, learn to apply in education the parable of the 
talents. In no other way can the capacities and native 
powers of our students be fully conserved and the work of 
the school made truly economical and efficient. Methods 
should be speedily devised whereby the school could be 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
ea PND RAR eM NEENT BE EY eeisag May NaN Ser tn em eee eie es mee ae 
90 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
organized and the work carried on in accordance with this 
principle. - 
That the maladjustment is greater in the high school 
than in the grades is important, because the high school 
has presumably conserved the most superior youths. 
Those with the most mediocre and inferior grades of intelli- 
gence presumably have been dropping out of school all 
along the way, until only the ablest remain. The special 
variety of talents in this highly selected group should be 
carefully cultivated and zealously conserved. The situa- 
tion cannot be met or the poor adjustment explained away 
by saying that the brighter students in high school are 
given an opportunity to do extra work in the various sub- 
jects studied. The situation calls for special and different 
treatment. Any and all special mental capacities and tal- 
ents possessed by this select group of individuals should 
be discovered at the earliest possible date and such adap- 
tations made by the school as will conserve them fully to 
the state. “If necessary, the high school organization and 
course of study should be entirely reorganized so that these 
students might be educated more in accordance with their 
, ‘ capacities and interests. Arrangements should at least 
be made whereby each student could advance as rapidly 
as is possible for him, and special provision should be made 
for taking care of that small group of individuals who pos- 
sess very superior mental ability or talents. 
There is much evidence in this and the following chap- 
ters to show that the most superior individuals are not 
being properly served by the schools. This has probably 
always been the case and helps to explain why so many  
-P-A-G-E-109
  INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL PROGRESS 91 
people who fail in school make such a marked success in 
life in every occupation. The least we could do, there- 
fore, would be to determine the real causes for failure 
and success in school, especially the causes for the failure 
of those known to be specially gifted in native mental en- 
dowment and the unexpected success of those possessing 
only average mental ability. ‘The real causes for the 
failure and success of students in school should be sys- 
tematically investigated and the grades of intelligence 
possessed by all students determined so that they might 
be grouped for purposes of instruction on the basis of 
mental strength. 
Perhaps the most startling group of facts revealed by 
the above comparisons is that the organization and work 
of the high school seems better adapted to the interests 
and needs of the girls than the boys. The reason why the 
girls are more rapidly promoted than the boys when the 
boys are superior to the girls in general intelligence needs 
explanation. We might infer that the girls possess mental 
characteristics other than general intelligence important 
for school success, characteristics not possessed by the 
boys. If true, it is important to determine what these 
characteristics are, and why they seem to work better in 
the high school than in the elementary grades. What is 
more likely is that the high school and its work is not so 
well adapted to the interests and needs of the boys as to 
the girls. The nature of the work itself may be poorly 
adapted to the boys. It may be due in part to the fact 
that there are too few men teachers in the high schools. 
The problem should be investigated so we may know why
-P-A-G-E-110
pce, 92 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
the superior boys are so often doing an inferior grade of 
school work. 
We also need more accurate methods for measuring 
school attainment or, still better, for measuring the rate 
and amount of improvement that is made in every kind 
of learning. These measurements of success in learning 
or in school accomplishment should be properly coédrdi- 
nated with the results obtained from a study of the native 
mental endowment of pupils. Progress in learning should, 
in fact, always be evaluated in relation to the native mental 
ability of the learner. - The progress which an individual 
can and is expected to make is intimately related to his na- 
tive mental endowment or ability to learn. The problem 
of measuring the results of teaching cannot be solved peda- 
gogically unless worked out in connection with a practical 
and reliable scheme of mental measurements. |, 
Investigations along all these lines will be required Before 
the problem of adjusting the organization and work of the 
school to the interests and needs of individual students 
can be fully and properly solved.

  CHAPTER VI 
INTELLIGENCE OF SENIORS MAKING EXCELLENT, 
AVERAGE, AND POOR SCHOLASTIC RECORDS 
IN THEIR HIGH SCHOOL WORK 
In the preceding chapter the intelligence of the high 
school seniors who had been accelerated, retarded, or nor- 
mally promoted by the school was determined and com- 
pared with the state standard. It was found that those 
who had been accelerated in high school or at some time 
during their entire school course ranked decidedly higher 
on the mental tests than did those who were retarded or 
only 1 rmally promoted, but that the brightest high school 
seniors in the state had not been accelerated; that those 
doubly promoted by th€ school possessed, as a rule, only 
a high average grade of intelligence, that some students 
with very superior grades of intelligence were retarded; 
that others with inferior intelligence were accelerated; 
and that practically all belonging to the highest intelligence 
rank for high school seniors had been only regularly pro- 
moted in high school, along with those who possessed the 
lowest grades of intelligence. 
- It has been generally assumed that students possessing 
a superior or very superior grade of intelligence can and 
will do a superior grade of school work. On this theory 
intelligence tests have recently been used by certain uni- 
93 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
94 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  versities in place of the usual college entrance examinations, 
and candidates are being selected for university scholar 
ships on the basis of the records they make on intelligence 
tests.. Pupils in the public schools have also been doubl: 
promoted by progressive teachers and superintendent: 
merely on the basis of the strength shown in intelligence 
tests. In most of these cases such students have bee 
successful in their academic work. But the results cite 
in the preceding chapter and other data recently gathere: 
by our own laboratory indicate pretty clearly that othe 
mental characteristics besides intelligence are importan 
factors in determining school success. On the basis o' 
the facts presented in the preceding chapter we must con- 
clude either that teachers and school officials are failing in| 
their work, that our measures of intelligence and of school} 
attainment are very inaccurate, or that other mental char- 
acteristics besides intelligence are important factors in 
determining the success or failure of students in school. 
Data gathered recently in our own laboratory ' show that 
we have no right to expect a student to do a very superior 
type of school or college work merely because he possesses 
a high degree of native mental endowment. He must 
possess additional characteristics, such as persistence, a 
proper attitude towards his teacher and the school, endur- 
ance, health, and the like, to be successful with his school 
work. All the factors which contribute to a pupil’s suc- 
cess or failure in school are not known. When determined,

     hey will probably show that general intelligence is insuffi- 
ient to guarantee an individual’s school success. 
Because of the importance of this problem and the rather 
idespread notion that students who have superior native 
ental endowment should by virtue of this fact stand high 
n all their school work, we desired to ascertain in this study 
he relation which actually existed between the intelli- 
ence of the seniors we tested and their academic achieve- 
ent. is 
Following the comparative method of studying various 
roups of high school seniors used throughout this investi- 
ation, we undertook (1) to determine the general level 
f intelligence of the seniors who had made an eacel- 
ent, average, and poor scholastic record in high school; 
2) to determine the range of intelligence possessed by 
hese various scholastic groups and to ascertain whether 
e brighter students made the best scholastic records 
nd the duller students the poorest school grades, etc.; 
(3) to determine the various grades of intelligence pos- 
essed by these various scholastic groups and their rela- 
ive frequency within each group; and (4) to ascertain 
he actual coefficient of correlation between the intelli- 
ence scores made by all high school seniors and the 
verage scholastic grades obtained in all high school sub- 
jects studied during the junior year. 
The data for these inquiries came from the reports of 
teachers and principals covering the average scholarship 
grades obtained by each senior in all high school subjects 
studied during his junior year. The junior year was 
selected because it was thought to be fairly representative 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
96 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  of the student’s scholastic record in high school. Hi: 
average grade in all subjects studied was taken because i 
was regarded as the most expressive single measure of eac 
student’s school success. 
In order to divide our total group into subgroups repre 
senting various grades of academic achievement w 
grouped them as follows: (1) “excellent” with academi 
averages ranging from 95 to 100 per cent; (2) “high or very] 
good” making grades from 90 to 94 per cent; (3) “good” 
from 85 to 89 per cent; (4) “medium” from 80 to 84 per| 
cent; (5) “fair” from 75 to 79 per cent; (6) “poor” from| 
60 to 74 per cent. Jn all our computations the two middle 
groups, rated “good” and “medium” will be considered as 
the average scholastic group. 
1. General level of intelligence of the seniors making| 
excellent average and poor scholastic records in high 
school. The general level of intelligence of those making 
different scholastic records in high school is indicated by 
the per cent of seniors belonging to each scholastic group 
who made scores on the intelligence tests above the median 
for our standard or total group. These results are shown 
in Table XII below.

As may easily be seen, there is a regular and rapid declin 
in intelligence as we pass from the “excellent” group t 
the “poorest,” showing that the grade of intelligenc 
possessed by an individual is an important factor in deter. 
mining his school success.

2. Range in intelligence shown by the seniors rated 
excellent, average, and poor in their high school work. 
If we ask which of these scholastic groups contains the 
largest percentage of seniors possessing the highest and 
lowest grades of intelligence, we find that the groups mak- 
ing the highest scholastic rating also contain the largest 
percentage of seniors making the best scores on our intelli- 
gence tests. Figure 25 shows the percentage of those 
belonging to each scholastic group who made an A or B 
rating on our intelligence tests; also the proportion belong- 
ing to each group possessing the lowest grades of intelli- 
gence (D, E, or F) found among high school seniors. It 
will be seen that the group rated “excellent,” i.e. those 
miaking scholastic grades ranging from 95 to 100, contains 
the largest percentage of students possessing an A or B 
grade of intelligence; that the group rated “poor” con- 
tains the smallest percentage of individuals possessing these 
higher intelligence grades; and that there is a regular and 
rapid decline in the percentage of individuals belonging to 
these several scholastic groups as we pass from the group 
making the highest scholastic record to the group making 
the poorest record in their high school work. 
If we inquire further which scholastic groups contain 
the brightest and dullest seniors, we obtain a similar result. 
The brightest students, if taken as a group, are found 
among those ranking “excellent” and “high” in their 
school work. The dullest seniors are found among those 
receiving the poorest grades on their school work. This 
is clearly shown by Table XIII.

ous scholastic groups reveals the fact that the seniors mak- 
ing the highest intelligence scores (the highest half of 
1 per cent of our total group) are not rated “excellent” 
on their school work. They are regularly rated as 
“high” or “good” except in the case of the boys, who are 
rated “medium” or “fair” as often as “high” or “good.” 
These tables also reveal the fact that many seniors who are 
tated “excellent” and “high” in their school work drop 
rather low in intelligence scores, but never so low as those 
rated ‘“ medium,” “ fair,” and “ poor” in their school 
work. We must, therefore, conclude that other factors 
besides intelligence play an important réle in determining 
school success. 
3. Frequency of different grades of intelligence among 
the individuals belonging to each scholastic group. 
A question of special interest is the way in which the
-P-A-G-E-119
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL GRADES 101 
different grades of intelligence possessed by high school 
seniors are distributed among the individuals belonging to 
each scholastic group. Frequency tables were prepared 
for each scholastic group, showing the percentage of in- 
dividuals belonging to each intelligence rank. Frequency 
curves were then drawn for each group, showing the per 
cent belonging to the several scholastic groups who pos- 
sessed each grade of intelligence from A+ to F. Lack of

space prevents us from presenting all these tables and 
curves. But the marked difference in the grades of intelli- 
gence possessed by the seniors making an “excellent” 
and “poor” rating in their high school work is shown in 
Figure 26. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    102 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
As may readily be seen, the curves for both the boys and 
girls making the highest scholastic records pass far above 
the curves for those making the poorest scholastic rating, 
at all points indicating the highest grades of intelligence 
possessed by high school seniors, and pass just about as 
far below these curves at all points indicating the lowest 
grades of intelligence. It will also be seen that the curves 
for the seniors rated “excellent” in their high school work 
culminate at the points indicating a B and C+ grade of 
intelligence. That is to say, a greater percentage of indi- 
viduals belonging to this scholastic group possess a B and 
C+ grade of intelligence than possess any other intelli- 
gence grade. The highest point in the curves for the 
seniors belonging to the group making the “poorest” 
scholastic rating on their high school work is found at the 
points indicating a C- and D grade of intelligence. The 
curve for the seniors making an average or “good” grade 
in their high school work would pass, if drawn, about mid- 
way between the curves for the best and poorest scholastic 
groups. The position of, the curves for this average scho- 
lastic group is shown by the dots in. the figure, which indi- 
cate the direction taken by the curve for this average group. 
The frequency curves for the other scholastic groups 
show that the largest percentage of the boys belonging to 
the scholastic group rated “high” fell at the C+ level, 
for the group rated “good” at the C level, and for the 
groups rated “medium ” and “ fair ” at the C- level. For 
the girls these high points in the frequency curves fell at 
B and Ct for “excellent” and “high,” at the C-level for 
the “good” and “medium” scholastic groups, and at
-P-A-G-E-121
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL GRADES 103 
the C- and D level for the group rated “fair” and 
“ poor.” 
4. Correlation between the intelligence of high school 
seniors and their scholastic success. If the correlation 
between the intelligence of high school seniors and 
their success in school were perfect, the facts revealed 
in the preceding chapter would have to be interpreted 
as a total failure on the part of the teachers and school 
officials to adapt their instruction and work to the 
interests and mental strength of their students, unless 
it could be shown that our methods for measuring general 
intelligence and evaluating school success were unreliable 
to a marked degree.’ If, on the other hand, these methods 
of measurement are reasonably reliable and adequate for 
making such a study of the relation between intelligence 
and school success as is here proposed, and if it were shown 
that the correlation between general intelligence and school 
success is rather low, it would tend to show that other fac- 
tors besides native mental endowment play an important 
réle in attaining school success. That there is a close re- 
lationship between general intelligence and school achieve- 
ment is shown by the facts presented above. ‘In order 
to measure more accurately the interdependence between 
these two factors, the coefficient of correlation was com- 
puted between the scores made in the mental tests and the 
academic grades of seniors. This was found to be .282, 
1 That our methods for measuring school achievement and general in- 
telligence are not perfect is a well-known fact, but they are sufficiently 
accurate to give a reliable result for such comparative studies as we are 
making. We may, therefore, accept the degree of correlation or lack of 
correlation as an indication of a similarity or divergence of the functions 
involved,

More accurate computations than the above were made 
from our data by Mr. Emmett A. Rice in his unpublished 
study of “The Correlation between Scholastic Success 
and Scores Made on Intelligence Tests,’ submitted in 
partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of 
Master of Arts at Indiana University, June, 1920.1 Mr. 
Rice selected at random 124 of the 276 seniors from the 
Shortridge, Indianapolis, high school, who took our intelli- 
gence tests and computed the correlation between the 
scores made on the intelligence tests and the record made 
in all high school subjects studied by these seniors during 
their four years’ high school course. Special care was exer- 
cised to determine that the scholastic success attained in 
the various high school subjects studied would really indi- 
cate similar grades of school achievement. All members 
of the group took English, mathematics, and a science, 
and Mr. Rice showed by working out separate correlations 
between the various science subjects, and between all 
foreign language subjects studied by this group, that the 
various science subjects presented about the same degree 
of difficulty. The same was found for the foreign lan- 
guage subjects. Mr. Rice then computed the correlation 
between the average of the marks obtained in each high 
school subject and the intelligence score; also between the 
average marks obtained in all science subjects and the

intelligence scores; and finally between all foreign language 
subjects and the intelligence scores. He then worked out 
the correlation between the intelligence scores and the 
average of the average of all scholastic grades which each 
student obtained during his four-year high school course. 
As might be expected, the correlation coefficients ob- 
tained by this more exact method of computation, which 
took in the student’s entire high school record, were higher 
than those we obtained by our method. As shown in 
Table XIV, the coefficient of correlation for the average 
of all scholastic grades is .47, P. E. .05; those for the 
various studies taken separately range from .25, P. E. .06, 
to .52, P. E. .06 (Pearson’s formula).

This, like our own figures, is a positive though rather

mental advance of .45;! Bobertag compared mental age 
with school marks and obtained a coefficient between poor 
marks and mental retardation of .52, and between good 
marks and mental development of .59; Pressey found a 
correlation between intelligence score and school marks of 
48;” Terman obtained a coefficient of correlation 
between school marks and mental age of .45.% 
It is conceivable that these rather low correlations be- 
tween school achievement and intelligence may be due to 
inaccuracies in our methods of measuring both intelligence 
and school achievement. The scholastic standing of our 
senior group was obtained by averaging the marks made 
on all high school subjects studied during the junior year. 
This included in many individual cases such subjects as 
music and art, which, according to Mr. Rice’s results, 
showed almost no positive correlation with intelligence 
score. For the various academic studies, the coefficient 
of correlation ranged from .25 for history to .52 for chem- 
istry, covering the entire four-year period. 
Another factor which may have tended to diminish 
our coefficient of correlation is the fact that our tests were 
given in so many schools (320) and that the mental exam- 
ination was given by as many different teachers. This 
would tend to make our intelligence scores less reliable. 
Moreover, the school marks given to our various senior 
classes doubtless represent a wide variation in standards

and reliability, being given by so many different teachers. 
It would, therefore, seem that the factor of intelligence 
might well be thought to play a somewhat larger réle in 
conditioning school success than is indicated by our coeffi- 
cient of correlation, a fact which must be taken into 
consideration in evaluating the other factors which con- 
dition school success. That this is the case is shown by 
the results which Mr. Rice obtained with his more accurate 
method of determining this correlation. But the fact 
that his total correlation was only .47 for a single large 
school and for the entire high school period, and that other 
correlations obtained between intelligence scores and aca- 
demic success hover pretty closely about this point, seems 
to indicate the importance for school success of other fac- 
tors besides mere intelligence. In the few investigations 
where a higher correlation has been obtained the intelli- 
gence scale used may contain tests which measured persist- 
ence, mental attitude, or interest, etc., in addition to mere 
ability to learn. Whatever the cause, the rather low cor- 
relation which we obtained, taken together with the facts 
revealed in the preceding chapter, must be taken into ac- 
count by all who are trying to obtain from pupils in the 
public school or from college students academic accom- 
plishment commensurate with their intellectual ability. 
That school success is vitally conditioned by native men- 
tal endowment is shown by the uniformly positive correla- 
tions obtained between intelligence score and school suc- 
cess. That this correlation is relatively low indicates 
without doubt that other factors besides intelligence enter 
into the making of a highly successful record in school.
-P-A-G-E-126

5. Why an intelligence score is not a reliable criterion 
of school success. The evidence seems to indicate that 
we are not in reality measuring the same thing when we 
test for intelligence and school success. In the former 
case we endeavor to measure native mental endowment, 
the ability to learn, or the ability to adapt oneself to new 
situations and problems. In the latter we measure actual 
performance: what the student has done or is doing. The 
results of intelligence tests indicate what he can do or 
is capable of doing. School marks, on the other hand, 
indicate primarily what he has done or is doing; they 
indicate for the most part specific or actual performance ; 
only in a secondary sense do school marks tell us anything 
about a student’s ability to perform. There may, there- 
fore, {be a rather wide discrepancy between the two in 
particular cases. 
It is further conceivable that a number of special mental 
factors may serve to enhance a student’s school perform- 
ance, factors which are quite different from general intelli- 
gence. One such factor is a good memory. This may be 
of far-reaching value to a pupil in attaining school success, 
because most of our school work to-day draws heavily 
upon a student’s sheer ability to retain and recall. Other 
mental characteristics not measured by an intelligence 
test, such as persistence, effort, mental attitude toward 
school, etc., might also be possessed by a student with 
only average ability, and may be deficient or totally lack- 
ing in another student who has marked intelligence. The 
former would attain a high degree of success in school, while 
the latter might even fail. Other factors not mental in
-P-A-G-E-127
  INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL GRADES 109 
character may also help to account for the low correlation. 
Most high schools permit students to elect a large part of 
their high school work. Some students may, therefore, 
select subjects in which they are specially interested and 
which are therefore easy for them. This would tend to 
raise their scholastic grade beyond what their native mental 
ability would lead us to expect. A pupil of only average 
or even mediocre ability may also attain marked success 
in school if he works hard and long, while a pupil with far 
superior mental ability may fail simply because the latter 
does not put forth sufficient effort to succeed. 
6. General summary and discussion of results.. Sum- 
marizing briefly the facts revealed by the above compari- 
sons we may say: 
1. There is a positive correlation between the intelli- 
gence score and success in school, indicating that general 
intelligence or ability to learn is an essential factor in 
determining school success. Those seniors who made the 
best mental rating on the intelligence tests, if taken as a 
group, made the best scholastic record in high school. 
Those making the poorest intelligence rating on the mental 
tests made the poorest scholastic rating. \The brightest 
students, considered as a group, fall among those making 
a school record of “excellent” or “very good.” The dull- 
est fall among those rated “poor” in their scholastic work. 
2. The amount of interdependence which exists be- 
tween these functions is indicated by the size of the coeffi- 
cient of correlation between intelligence score and scholastic 
success or average mark earned in the various school sub- 
jects studied. This ranged for the different high school
-P-A-G-E-128
110 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  subjects from .25 to .52; for all subjects studied during 
the junior year from .282 for the boys to .277 for the girls. 
For all subjects studied during the entire high school course 
by a representative group of 124 high school seniors, it was 
AT, P. E. .05. 
3. If taken for individual cases, intelligence scores are 
poor criteria for predicting the kind and amount of school 
success that will be attained. This fact of variability 
in individual cases might of course be due to inaccuracies 
in our measurement of both functions or to accidental 
factors affecting the test score. It more probably indi- 
cates, when taken together with the fact that the correla- 
tion between intelligence scores and scholastic success is 
not very high, that other factors besides intelligence play 
an important réle in attaining school success; that we 
are not, in reality, measuring the same functions; that 
mere ability to learn and do are not synonymous with 
actual performance; that because a pupil has the ability 
to learn or do his school work, it by no means follows that 
he will do it; or that because he has the ability or capacity 
he can and will properly apply it, when confronted by his 
tasks in school or life. A mere intelligence test is evi- 
dently no criterion for what a pupil will do in school. 
To what extent and in what ways it may be used to prog- 
nosticate success in school or life needs to be more carefully 
determined than has been done heretofore. 
4. The results of this chapter throw considerable light 
on the maladjustments revealed in the preceding chapter. 
The fact that many seniors who gave unmistakable evi- 
dence that they possess superior mental ability (no stu-
-P-A-G-E-129
INTELLIGENCE AND SCHOOL GRADES I11 
     
        
   
   
   
     
   
   ent could legitimately make a high score on the intelligence 
ests unless he really had the mental ability to do so) but 
ho nevertheless fail to make school progress commensu- 
ate with that ability, and the additional fact that some 
niors apparently make a marked success in their school 
ork, who, nevertheless, give evidence of possessing only 
verage or inferior grades of intelligence — these facts 
ay, in the light of the data at hand, be interpreted in a 
umber of ways. (1) The latter group of seniors may 
jossess certain mental characteristics essential for school 
success other than mere ability to learn or do, such as a 
ood memory, determination, a proper mental attitude 
owards their teacher and the school work, which the for- 
er lacks. (2) Such a situation may also indicate an 
lactual mistake on the part of the teacher and the school. 
he work may be for many reasons ill adapted to the 
pupil’s interests and mental strength. In such cases the 
failure to succeed should be charged to the school. 
(3) Some students making low scores on the mental tests 
may not have done themselves justice for a number of rea~ 
sons, and may, therefore, be as bright or even more capable 
than the students who gave evidence of superior mental 
ability. But this would not account for the failure of the 
students who gave unmistakable signs of superior mental 
ability, and who were rated as failures or part failures in 
their school work. Such cases, it would seem, must be 
charged to the inefficiency of the schools. 
We need to make a more careful and systematic study 
of the causes of school success and failure than has ever 
been made. We cannot safely assume that because a

112 ae re OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
ws 4% 
pupil has superior native mental endowment he will bi 
able and willing to use it when confronted by his schoo 
tasks. Other factors, besides native mental capacity 
are doubtless essential for success in school and life. W 
need to determine what these factors or mental character} 
istics are. We ought to know why we do not get a highe 
positive correlation between intelligence scores and schoo 
success than we do; why there are such marked individual! 
exceptions to the general rule; why one student with su- 
perior native mental endowment does not succeed in hig! 
school or college while another with lower intelligenc 
does; why so many boys with superior intelligence ari 
making poor or mediocre records in high school whil 
girls with inferior grades of native mental endowment: 
are surpassing them in their school work. 
It is evident from these and other facts revealed in thi: 
and the preceding chapter that other factors beside: 
ability to do and learn should be taken into account whe 
students are recommended for a university fellowshi 
or are accelerated in school. These factors should b 
determined by careful and systematic investigation. 
systematic and careful study of the causes of school succes: 
and failure must be made before the maladjustment: 
revealed in this and the preceding chapter can be properly} 
remedied.

CHAPTER VII 
INTELLIGENCE OF SENIORS SELECTING DIFFERENT 
OCCUPATIONAL CAREERS 
     
  WHEN we ask what the school is able to accomplish, or 
what the aim of education really is, we get a variety of 
lanswers, which depend upon the wisdom of our informants 
land their philosophy of life. Many different opinions 
have been expressed upon this subject, but it may truly 
be said that in our educational theory and practice to-day 
we stand, as it were, upon the shoulders of the past. That 
is to say, we embody the best that the thought and experi- 
ence of the race has preserved for our guidance.. At differ- 
ent periods of man’s experience with the problem of educa- 
tion different purposes have been emphasized as guides 
to educational practice. For the ancient Hebrews the 
chief aim of education was to inculcate goodness, to de- 
velop men and women whose every act would be pleasing 
in the sight of Jehovah. The Greeks were inspired by 
the idea of a complete, harmonious, and perfect develop- 
ment of the individual; and they bent all energy towards 
the realization of this ideal. The Romans emphasized 
efficiency. For them the purpose of education was to 
make perfect Roman citizens, capable of bearing the bur- 
dens of citizenship in the Roman state. The early Chris- 
tians emphasized the idea of discipline. For them educa- 
tion became a mere means for developing Christian men 
and women, for disciplining human nature and desires, 
113
-P-A-G-E-132
    414 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
in preparation for a better and future life. This in tim 
broke away completely from the ideal of human perfectio 
developed by the Greeks. Later, with the developmen 
of science and our better understanding of human nature, 
new ideals and purposes were emphasized and these older 
aims were seen with new and extended vision. The ideal 
of training and discipline presents a curious path of devel- 
opment. The humanistic ideal of human perfection, 
originated by the Greeks, has been greatly extended and 
refined. The conception that education is chiefly a pro- 
cess of acquisition which must introduce each child into 
the achievements of the race; that it is a process of form- 
ing right habits of thought and action; a process of form- 
ing permanent interests in the truth and in the things which 
are beautiful and good; a process whereby we may secure 
a better adaptation to our environment; an efficient prepa- 
ration for social service, etc. — these ideals have all been 
added to the list of purposes held and emphasized by educa- 
tional leaders. 
Our ideas to-day in regard to what the school should 
strive to accomplish are derived from the experiences of 
the race with the problem and from our present under- 
standing of the meaning and purpose of human life. 
While all are by no means agreed with regard to details, 
or the means which should be employed to obtain the de- 
sired results, all would agree that education should some- 
how aid in securing healthy, normal, and perfect develop- 
ment of the individual, including the conservation and 
development of all his capacities and powers; that the dis- 
cipline or training of certain mental abilities is important;
-P-A-G-E-133
INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 115 
that the acquisition of knowledge, proper interests, and 
right habits of conduct and thought is essential; and that 
right adjustment is needed, all to the end that each indi- 
vidual may be so educated or trained that he will be able 
to do his full share of the world’s work and be willing to 
serve his day and generation in direct proportion to his 
talents and capacities, which he has been taught to con- 
serve and use in such service to the world. 
In order to determine to what extent the schools of the 
state were practically embodying this essential feature of 
our present aim of education, we asked each senior taking 
the tests to state whether or not he had selected his life 
occupation, and if so, to give the name of the vocation 
chosen, to give the name of the study in high school which 
he most enjoyed, the course which he had pursued in 
high school, etc. These answers, together with the data 
collected concerning his college intentions, would, it was 
believed, throw important light on the extent to which 
these young people were being directed towards and pre- 
pared for the type of social service best suited to their men- 
tal capacities and their intellectual and social needs. Data 
bearing on various aspects of this problem will be presented 
in this and the two chapters which immediately follow. 
In collecting data on the choice of an occupation, we 
had in mind the following specific problems: (1) to ascer- 
tain to what extent high school seniors in Indiana had 
actually selected the occupation which they intended to 
follow as a life career; (2):to compare the intelligence 
scores made by the group of seniors who had definitely 
chosen a life occupation with the record made on the tests      
-P-A-G-E-134
  116 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  by those who had not, in order to determine whether more 
of the brightest students had selected a vocation in life 
than those possessing inferior grades of intelligence; 
(8) to obtain an exact list of the occupations chosen by high 
school seniors and to ascertain which occupations were 
being selected by the largest number ; (4) to determine the 
general level of intelligence of the seniors selecting different 
occupations, by comparing the intelligence scores of the in- 
dividuals belonging to each occupational group ; and (5) to 
determine, if possible, the extent to which these young 
people had been preparing in high school and were definitely 
planning to prepare in college for the occupations chosen. 
1. Intelligence of students who had selected a 
life occupation contrasted and compared with the in- 
telligence of the group who had not. Our first problem 
was to ascertain whether the students who had selected 
a life occupation ranked higher on the intelligence tests 
than the group who had not. It might naturally be 
supposed that the brightest students would be think- 
ing more about the choice of an occupation than the 
seniors of only average or inferior ability.1 The data 
were, therefore, examined and the results compiled with this 
question in mind. It was found that a total of 64 per cent 
of the boys and 60 per cent of the girls stated that they had 
selected a vocation in life ;? 36 per cent of the boys and 
40 per cent of the girls had either not decided, or failed 
1This would be expected unless the fact that those with inferior in- 
telligence who are forced to drop out of school or who have been con- 
templating going to work are forced to decide and think about making a 
vocational choice more than their classmates. 
2The fact that approximately two-thirds of our total senior group had 
chosen their vocation in life is a rather unexpected result. This is par-
-P-A-G-E-135
  INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 117 
to answer the question.1_ The scores made on our intelli- 
gence tests by these two groups were then studied with 
a view of determining (1) the general level of intelligence 
of each group; (2) the percentage of individuals belonging 
to each group possessing the highest and lowest grades of 
mental ability ; and (3) the relative frequency with which 
each grade of mental ability was found among the members 
of the group. 
The best indication of the general level of intelligence of 
these two groups of seniors is the median and 25 and 75 
percentile scores; in other words, the record made by 
the middle 50 per cent of the students belonging to each 
group. These figures, together with the per cent belonging 
to each group who made scores above the median for our 
total or standard group, are shown in Table XV. 
ticularly true when we compare this situation with the condition found 
in most liberal arts colleges to-day, where most students still seem to be 
adrift, so far as the choice of an occupation is concerned. At first thought 
one might be inclined to regard this result with suspicion ; inferring that 
the answers were not genuine, but hastily given, because it was sug- 
gested to them that they should have chosen a vocation in life. This 
does not seem to be the case. In working over all our data on this point 
we became convinced somewhat against our will that the choices made 
were genuine. Most of these young people were actually preparing or 
definitely planning to prepare for the occupations chosen. It should also 
be remembered that, taken as a group, they are not really comparable 
with the average group of college students. Many of the high school 
seniors who had not selected a life occupation expected to go to college. 
Those whose school days were practically over had been thinking about 
what they expected to do. These facts, taken together with the fact that 
vocational education and vocational guidance have been specially empha- 
sized fora number of years by Indiana high schools, many of them having 
regular vocational directors, will help to explain this rather unusual result. 
1Only 59 per cent of the boys and 56 per cent of the girls named the 
exact occupation which they expected to follow as their life work. (See 
Table XVI.)

Another indication of the general Jevel of intelligence 
possessed by each of these groups is given by the curves 
in Figure 27, showing the scores obtained by various pro- 
portionate groups of boys and girls who had (1) selected 
and (2) not selected their vocation in life. From the data 
given in Table XV and the percentile curves shown in 
Figure 27 it may be seen that the score made on the tests 
by the seniors who had selected a vocation in life are 
slightly higher than those made by the group which had 
not. But the difference is so small that it may have little 
or no significance. 
But this result might be obtained even if the brightest 
students in our total group had selected their life occupa- 
tion. Enough students possessing a high average grade 
of intelligence might be undecided to even up the scores 
of the two groups when compared on the basis of central 
tendency alone. We were, therefore, interested to know 
whether a larger percentage of individuals belonging to the 
group who had selected an occupation were rated A or B 
than were found among the group who had not. Figure 
28 compares the percentage of individuals belonging to

INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 121 
  compare the percentage of boys and girls who earned a 
mental rating of A+ or A on the tests, we find a more no- 
ticeable difference in favor of the group which had selected 
a vocation in life. Of the boys belonging to this group 
10.47 per cent made a mental rating of At or A on the 
tests, as against 7.58 per cent for the group who had not 
selected a vocation. Among the girls the difference is 
less — 7.21 per cent for the group who had decided upon 
a vocation, and 6.53 per cent for the group who had not. 
The above results may be interpreted to mean that little 
thought is being given by high school seniors to the matter 
of choosing their vocation in life. Those indicating a 
definite choice rated only very slightly higher on the men- 
tal tests than did the group that had made no choice. 
The percentile curves run along almost together for both 
boys and girls. (See Figure 27.) The percentage of boys 
rated A or B was only slightly higher for the group that 
had selected their life occupation, and the percentage of 
the total group rated D, E, or F was only slightly lower than 
for the group that had not. (Compare Figure 28.) But 
there is some evidence that the brightest boys, those rated 
At or A, are more concerned about their future life work 
than those possessing the lower grades of ability. The 
most significant fact revealed by the comparisons, how- 
ever, seems to be that there is so little difference between 
these two groups. This may be accounted for in part by 
the fact that so many of the brightest seniors going to 
college had not chosen their vocation in life, while practi- 
cally all of those not planning to go to college had come to 
a place where some decision had to be made.

  2. Intelligence of seniors selecting different occupa- 
tional careers. While the difference in scores made by the 
group of seniors who had selected a life occupation and of 
those who had not is very slight, as we have seen, there is 
a marked difference between the intelligence ratings made 
by the groups selecting different occupations, as was shown 
by comparing the records each group made on the mental 
tests. In order to compare the grades of intelligence pos- 
sessed by the various occupational groups we classified 
the various occupations chosen into the following classes: 
(1) Physician, including doctors, surgeons, osteopaths, 
etc.; (2) Teacher, all kinds, including teachers of music 
and physical culture; (3) Scientist, including chemists, 
biologists, sociologists, research specialists, ete. ; (4) Engi- 
neer, mechanical, electrical, civil, mining, and chemical ; 
(5) Business and commercial pursuits, merchant, adver- 
tising, real estate, banking, salesman, etc.; (6) Lawyer; 
(7) Journalist, including author, editor, writer, etc. ; 
(8) Clerical worker, including clerking, office work, clerk 
in bank, bookkeeper, secretary, stenographer, etc. ; 
(9) Skilled mechanic or artisan, including such trades- 
men as telegrapher, painter, decorator, jeweler, glass 
worker, carpenter, etc.; (10) Social worker, missionary, 
church work, Y.M.C.A., etc.; (11) Entertainer, reader, 
Chautauqua lecturer, actor, etc.; (12) Nurse; (13) Musi- 
cian; (14) Farmer; (15) Homemaker; (16) Minister. 
The occupations chosen by the largest number of in- 
dividuals may be readily selected from the list contained 
in Table XVI by noting the number of seniors who selected 
each occupation.

Our second problem was 
  (1) to ascertain the general 
level of intelligence of the seniors who had selected each 
of these lines of work; (2) to ascertain which occupations 
were attracting the brightest high school seniors; and 
(3) to determine whether students possessing very superior, 
average, inferior, and very inferior grades of ability were 
going into each of these lines of work in about equal num- 
bers or whether some occupations were drawing the bright- 
est students, others those with only average ability, and 
still others attracting students who possess the more in- 
ferior grades of intelligence. Data bearing on each of 
these questions will be presented in order in the following 
tables and curves. 
(a) General level of ability of the seniors selecting 
different occupations. Figures 29 and 30 show the rec-

It may readily be seen from Figure 29 that the group of

“ahead of all other groups. Those selecting business, medi-

Another method for measuring the general level of in- 
telligence of these several occupational groups which might 
tbe used is to calculate the percentage belonging to each 
occupational group who made scores above the state me- 
dian. Table XVII gives data on this point and shows 
also the median score for each group. An inspection of 
the table will show that the several occupational groups 
occupy the same relative positions in this comparison that 
they did in the comparisons made in Figures 29 and 30

above. The engineering group has a slightly higher per- 
centage of boys making scores above the state median| 
than we might expect from the former comparison, due to} 
the fact that a large percentage of the prospective engineers 
made only an average (C) or high average (C+) score on 
the tests.

  (c) Number in each occupational group scoring at various} 
intelligence levels. Other important differences between| 
the several occupational groups are revealed by the dis- 
tribution tables for each group and the tables (not printed] 
in this study) constructed to show the per cent of seniors| 
belonging to the several occupational groups who possess| 
each grade of intelligence from A to F. Frequency curves} 
drawn from the data contained in these tables picture graph-| 
ically the percentage of students selecting each occupation| 
who possess each grade of ability found among high school} 
seniors. Sample curves are shown in Figures 33 to 39. 
These frequency curves and the data contained in the! 
distribution tables for the several occupational groups 
showed not only the inequalities in mental strength found 
among the seniors selecting different occupations, but other 
significant differences. For example, seniors making an 
A* rating on the tests often select an occupation which 
was regularly chosen by seniors possessing the lowest 
grades of mental ability found among high school seniors. 
This is particularly true for the girls choosing stenography 
and teaching. Many girls electing teaching made the 
lowest scores obtained by any high school seniors. . Others 
electing teaching as a profession possessed the highest grades 
of ability found among our total or standard group. In this 
occupation there is an opportunity for advancement and 
for the exercise of the full mental capacities of the bright- 
est girls; but it may be questioned whether the brightest 
seniors in the entire state would find adequate exercise 
for their mental powers if they engaged in mere steno- 
graphic or clerical work, which they selected, not to mention

intelligence than is the case for the farmer group is shown 
by the position of the two curves at the points indicating 
these highest grades of intelligence. That the farmer

these students were specially interested is a determining

selected a college which would fit them for the occupation 
they had chosen. The effect which their choice of a high 
school course had upon their choice of an occupation and 
upon their college intention is shown in the following chap- 
ter. The extent to which these seniors were planning to
-P-A-G-E-155
INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 187 
prepare in college for the occupation selected is shown best 
by their college intentions as set forth below. 
Our tabulations were made in such a way (by making use 
of initial letters, special characters, and different colored 
inks) that we could ascertain the percentage of students 
choosing each occupation who were (1) going to college; 
(2) not going to college; (3) going to a college of liberal 
arts; (4) going to a technical or professional school; 
and (5) the percentage who had not decided what kind of 
college they would attend. These comparisons revealed 
the following facts : 
1. The high school seniors who had selected a life - 
occupation not only knew the requirements for the occupa- 
tion selected, but they were actually planning to attend 
the type of college and to take the kind of course which 
would give them the best possible preparation for the work 
in life which they had selected. All of the prospective 
ministers stated that they were going to college, 75 per 
cent of them selecting a college of liberal arts. Of those 
expecting to be engineers 96 per cent stated that they 
would attend college next year, and all but one of this 
group stated that they were going to an engineering 
or technical college. Only one was undecided in regard 
to the kind of college he expected to attend. Of the pro- 
spective lawyers 97 per cent had definitely decided to go to 
college and 100 per cent of this group were planning to 
go to a professional school. Of the group selecting medi- 
cine 92 per cent stated that they expected to go to college 
and 82 per cent of this group selected a professional school. 
Of those selecting the profession of teaching 95 per cent
-P-A-G-E-156
  138 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
were going to college and 87 per cent of this number ex- 
pected to attend a normal school or a liberal arts college. 
Only 66 per cent of the skilled artisan group and 54 per 
cent of the group going into business expected to attend 
college. Most of the skilled mechanics (56 per cent) were 
going to a technical school, and 30.5 per cent of those going 
into business selected a college of liberal arts. Of the pro- 
spective farmer group only 5 per cent expected to go to col- 
lege, and only 27 per cent of this number expected to attend 
an agriculture college. (See Table XIX.)

2. While the basic conditions for selection and prepara- 
tion for the occupations chosen seems, therefore, to be 
fairly satisfactory, the most significant fact revealed by the
-P-A-G-E-157
    
INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 139 
above comparisons does not appear on the surface ; namely, 
the small number of occupations actually selected by this 
large group of high school graduates. Only 16 lines of 
work were chosen by the 6188 high school seniors. Of the 
girls selecting a definite occupation 81 per cent chose ste- 
nography or teaching ; 80 per cent of the boys chose only 
four lines of work. This shows rather clearly that our 
high schools are poorly adapted to meet the vocational in- 
terests and needs of all classes of students, and are not 
adequately meeting the vocational needs of the state. 
Our results on this point show that the high school prepares 
for and directs young people towards only a few standard 
occupations; that they are not, in fact, institutions meeting 
the interests and needs of their students or the vocational 
needs of the state. Many of these seniors are more or 
less adrift, so far as their life work is concerned. Others 
are selecting work ill adapted to their native mental 
strength. All seem to need more efficient educational and 
vocational guidance than our high schools are at present 
able to give them. 
4. General summary and discussion of results. Sum- 
marizing briefly the results obtained in this chapter we 
have the following: 
1. About two-thirds of the seniors taking our tests 
had chosen their vocation in life. The number is slightly 
greater among the boys (64 per cent) than among the girls 
(60 per cent). 
2. Only 16 different lines of work were chosen by our 
total group of more than 6000 seniors. Some of these 
occupations were selected by so few seniors as to make
-P-A-G-E-158
140 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  them almost negligible. The occupations selected most 
often by the boys were engineering (31 per cent) and farm- 
ing (24 per cent) ; by the girls teaching (47 per cent) and 
clerical work (34 per cent). These results suggest that 
the high schools of the state are not meeting the vocational 
needs of their students as well as they should. We have 
boys and girls coming into our high schools from all classes 
and occupational groups. The high school is unconsciously 
directing them towards a few lines of work — the tradi- 
tional professions. Many of these seniors are adrift so 
far as the selection of their life work is concerned. Others 
are selecting occupations and actually preparing or plan- 
ning to prepare for lines of work ill adapted to their mental 
strength. It is clear that these young people need more 
efficient vocational guidance than our high schools are 
at present able to give them. Our results clearly show 
that they are planning to prepare for the occupations chosen 
on the basis of their limited high school experience and 
without the skilled advice needed to enable them to 
make a choice in accordance with their mental abilities, 
not to mention the opportunities offered for economic 
success in the occupation selected. 
3. From the data collected it further appears that 
little thought is being given by high school seniors to the 
matter of selecting their vocation in life. Those having 
selected an occupation rank only slightly higher on the 
tests, if taken as a group, than the seniors who had not 
done so. There is almost no difference between the two 
groups in central tendency and there are about as many 
seniors ranked A or B in the group which had not selected
-P-A-G-E-159
  INTELLIGENCE AND VOCATIONAL CHOICE 141 
life occupation as in the group which had selected a vo- 
ation in life. The brightest boys, those rated At, seem, 
owever, to have decided in larger numbers than those 
ith more inferior grades of ability. 
4. There is a marked difference in the intelligence of 
he seniors selecting different occupational careers. The 
oys going into the ministry, journalism, and science rank 
intellectually above other occupational groups both in 
entral tendency and in the percentage of individuals be- 
longing to the group who make the highest intelligence 
atings made by high school seniors. Those selecting 
edicine, business, and farming make the lowest ratings in 
he tests. Those selecting law, engineering, and teaching 
ecupy a position. about midway between. The girls se- 
lecting journalism, social service, and law rank above every 
ther occupational group. Those selecting clerical work, 
ursing, music, or art, if taken as a group, rank lowest in 
he intelligence test ; the group selecting teaching, medicine, 
nd homemaking, taken as a whole, occupy a middle posi- 
ion, and these rankings remain the same whether we com- 
are them on the basis of central tendency or percentage of 
he total group possessing the higher grades of intelligence. _

ng. Those selecting certain professions, notably medi- 
ine, possess only average mental ability for high school 
eniors; they are only on a par mentally with the group 
electing a skilled trade, a very significant fact, if gener- 
lly true, for our coming physicians. 
6. The range in intelligence within certain of these
-P-A-G-E-160
  142 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
occupational groups is very great. Many girls electin 
the profession of teaching make the lowest intelligenc 
rating made by high school seniors; others make th 
highest. The brightest senior girls in the entire stat 
selected clerical work, though the average intelligenc 
rating for this occupation is very low. Similar inequalii 
ties occur among the male occupational groups. In som 
of these occupations there is opportunity for the exercis 
of the full mental capacities and powers of the brightes 
students; in others there is need for only inferior in 
telligence. The latter occupations were nevertheles 
selected by the brighest seniors in the state, not to men 
tion the unfortunate condition that the dullest seniors ar 
selecting such occupations as teaching, medicine, and nurs 
ing in large numbers, which clearly demand the exercise o! 
a mental equipment beyond their native mental powers! 
These and other facts revealed in this chapter poin 
to a clearly defined need for wiser vocational directio: 
for high school seniors, guidance which will at least ad. 
just the occupation chosen to the mental strength of th 
individual. In no other way will we be able to con 
serve and economically cultivate the full capacities an 
talents of the young people of the state. 
7. Our results show further that the seniors who ha 
chosen their occupation not only knew what is necessar 
to prepare for the vocation selected, but they are i 
nearly every case definitely planning to prepare for th 
occupation chosen, a fact which emphasizes still furthe 
the need for wiser vocational and educational directio: 
in high school.

  CHAPTER VIII 
TELLIGENCE OF SENIORS PURSUING DIFFERENT 
COURSES IN;HIGH SCHOOL 
SEVEN curricula, differing rather widely in subject mat- 
ler, requirements for graduation, and purpose were offered 
the high schools codperating in this study —the classical, 
cademic, scientific, general, college preparatory, com- 
ercial or business, and so-called vocational courses.! 
Many educational traditions cluster around some of 
hese courses. There is also a tendency on the part of 
any teachers and parents to attach greater educational 
Importance to some of these courses than to others. Some 
f them, with the emphasis given to certain subjects, have 
en forced into the high school by influences from without 
he school ; and it has often been charged that parents and 
eachers advise the brightest or most ambitious students 
‘0 take certain of these courses in preference to others. We 
esired, therefore, to compare the scores made on the in- 
elligence tests by the seniors who were completing each 
ype of course, to ascertain : (1) which course was attract- 
ng the ablest students graduating from the high schools 
f the state; (2) which course was sending most students 
1It should be pointed out that the traditional high school curricula 
lesignated by these various names have been very materially modified 
in Indiana in recent years in order to modernize the high school course 
and to attempt to adapt it more nearly to the varying needs of all classes 
of students. See manual for course of study for Indiana high schools, 
Department of Public Instruction, Bulletin No, 35, 1918.

to college; (3) what effect, if any, the course pursued it 
high school was having upon the selection of an occupa 
tion and the selection of a college course; and (4) th 
courses pursued by the largest number of seniors who wer 
accelerated or retarded by the school. 
It should be pointed out at the beginning, however, tha: 
only a few of the high schools giving the tests offered al 
of these courses. Some offer only two, three, four, or five 
The chances for a senior to elect each of these course: 
were, therefore, not equal, since the choice in many school: 
was limited. Notwithstanding this fact our results ar 
clear and striking. Table XX shows the number of boy: 
and girls who were successfully completing each type o' 
high school course.

that the students completing other types of courses rank

mercial, and vocational. It should also be pointed out

several course-groups and the percentages making scores| 
above the median for our total or standard group.

       percentage of seniors rated D, E, or F’, with the commercial 
and vocational courses coming next. The college prepara: 
tory, commercial, and vocational courses contained th 
largest percentage of seniors possessing an average or © 
grade of ability. ) Where the per cent rated A or B is hig! 
and the per cent making scores above the state median low, 
as is the case with the classical group, it means that al 
large proportion of the group are rated C+ or C. Most of 
these facts are shown in Figure 40, which indicates the per 
cent of seniors pursuing each course who made an A or B 
and a D, E, or F intelligence rating on our tests. As may 
readily be seen, there is a regular gradation downwards 
from the classical to the vocational course. 
If we push our comparisons one step further to ascertain 
which courses are being taken by the seniors rated At or 
A and E or F, we find that the brightest and dullest stu- 
dents are not found in the classical course-group, but in the 
academic or general courses. A special distribution table 
was prepared showing the percentage of students pursuing 
each type of course who possess each grade of ability from 
At (approximately the highest 1 per cent of our standard 
group) to F (the intelligence rating for approximately the 
lowest 1 per cent of the total group). This comparison 
shows that there are proportionally more students with 
these very superior grades of ability among the seniors 
selecting the academic and scientific courses than among 
those selecting the classical or college preparatory courses. 
In fact, the proportion of “very superior” students in the 
vocational courses is about as high as it is in the classical 
course. (See Table XXII.)

3. Number of students pursuing different courses who 
score at the various intelligence levels. | That the com- 
mercial and vocational courses contained proportionately 
more seniors possessing average intelligence and fewer 
from the higher levels and correspondingly more from 
the lower levels of intelligence is graphically) shown by 
the frequency curves in Figures 41 and 42, which show 
the per cent of seniors pursuing various types of high 
school courses who possess each grade of intelligence from 
A+ to F. A mere glance at these curves will show that 
for all the higher grades of mental ability the curves for the 
students pursuing the classical, academic, and scientific 
courses pass above the curves for the vocational and com- 
mercial groups, but for all the lower grades of ability the 
curves for the commercial and vocational groups rise 
above the other curves. 
4. High school courses pursued by the students 
whom the school had accelerated or retarded. As 
shown in Chapter V the seniors who were promoted more 
rapidly than normally by the school rated higher on the

mental tests than did those who were retarded or only nor- 
mally advanced. We were, therefore, interested to know 
what courses had been selected by the seniors whom the 
schools had accelerated, retarded, or normally promoted.

were found among the groups who selected any of the other

make records which place them about midway between 
these other groups. We therefore divided our seniors into 
three groups :/(1) the graduates from the classical, scien-

intelligence; (2) the graduates from the commercial, col-

lege preparatory, and vocational courses because they 
ranked lowest in intelligence; and (3) the graduates from 
the general course because they made an intelligence rating 
which placed them midway between the other two groups. 
We next distributed these seniors with reference to age at 
graduation in order to discover which course-groups had

  been accelerated, retarded, or normally promoted by the| 
school to the greatest degree. 
Table XXIII gives this information and shows that! 
the courses containing the largest proportion of students 
with superior intelligence (the classical, academic, and 
scientific) have also the highest percentage of seniors ac- 
celerated, or graduating at the ages of 15, 16, or 17; and 
that the vocational, commercial, and college preparatory 
courses contain the smallest percentage of students ac- 
celerated by the school. This is especially true for the 
boys.

seniors belonging to these age-groups graduating from the 
general, vocational, commercial, or college preparatory 
courses, and a decrease in the percentage of students grad- 
uating from the academic, classical, and scientific courses, 
showing that the latter courses contain a larger proportion 
of seniors who had been accelerated, and the former a 
larger percentage of students who had been retarded by 
the school. 
This is still more clearly brought out if we compare the 
percentage of students graduating from the academic and 
general courses, shown in Table XXIV.

5. High school courses sending most students to col- 
lege. A question of considerable importance is the effect 
which the choice of a high school course has upon a stu- 
dent’s college intention and his choice of a vocation in life. 
Table XXV shows the percentage of boys and girls com- 
pleting each type of course who stated positively that they 
were going to college. | The table shows that the scientific,
-P-A-G-E-172
154 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
college preparatory, and classical courses send a greater 
percentage of their students to college than the general, 
academic, commercial, or vocational courses. \The scien- 
tific course ranks highest in this respect ; the commercial 
and vocational courses lowest.

6. Effect of high school course on choice of college 
and selection of a college course. Another question of 
considerable importance was suggested by our compar- 
ative study of the occupations chosen, the high school 
subjects preferred, and the kind of college selected by 
our total group of seniors. To what extent had these 
young people been preparing in high school and how defi- 
nitely are they looking’ forward to collegiate work which 
will prepare them for the occupations chosen? Table 
XXVI shows the percentage completing each type of 
high school course who stated that they were going to a 
liberal arts college, or to a professional or technical school, 
and also the percentage who had not selected the college 
they expected to attend.

While these facts are not conclusive, they show pretty 
clearly that most of the boys pursuing a scientific, voca- 
tional, and college preparatory course in high school, who 
plan to go to college, expect to attend a technical school. 
What is still more suggestive is the fact that boys gradu- 
ating from the classical, academic, and general courses are 
going to technical colleges rather than to colleges of liberal 
arts. But the most significant fact is the large percent- 
age of boys graduating from the scientific and vocational 
courses who have selected a technical college and the 
large percentage of those graduating from a general course 
who have not decided what college they will attend. 
Most of the girls have selected a college of liberal arts, 
as we might expect. The girls are naturally more un- 
settled vocationally than the boys. The students grad- 
uating from the college preparatory, scientific, and classi-
-P-A-G-E-174
156 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  cal courses seem to be more firmly decided upon what they 
are going to do, i.e. more students in these groups have 
decided definitely what college they will attend. The 
largest percentage of boys going to liberal arts colleges 
have graduated from the commercial, college preparatory, 
or classical courses. The largest percentage of girls going 
to liberal arts colleges graduated from a college prepara- 
tory, general, scientific, or classical course. 
7. General summary of the findings. Summarizing 
briefly the facts revealed by the various comparisons 
made in this chapter, we may say : 
1. That the classical, academic, and scientific courses, 
if taken as a whole, attracted the ablest students graduat- 
ing from the high schools of the state last year, that the 
group of students completing a vocational course rank 
lowest on the intelligence tests, and that the students 
electing a general and college preparatory or commercial 
course rank somewhere between these other groups. This 
is true whether we compare these various course-groups 
on the basis of central tendency — the general level of 
intelligence possessed by the group — or on the basis of 
the percentage belonging to the group who make the high- 
est intelligence scores made by any high school seniors. 
2. The brightest seniors in the state, 7.e. those making 
an intelligence rating of A+, were completing an academic 
course. A few individuals ranking in this highest 1 per- 
centile group for all high school seniors were found in the 
commercial, vocational, and general courses. None in 
this most superior group was taking a classical or college 
preparatory course.
-P-A-G-E-175
  TELLIGENCE AND CHOICE OF CURRICULA 157 
3. The dullest seniors were found in the general course. 
4, The courses showing the widest range in intelligence 
ere the academic, general, and commercial. The seniors 
mpleting scientific, classical, college preparatory, and 
ocational courses were much more evenly matched in 
ental strength, 7.e. they were bunched more about the 
edian. These latter course-groups, taken as a whole, 
ight then rank higher or lower than our standard group. 
he scientific and classical course-groups rank higher 
nd the college preparatory and vocational courses, lower. 
5. The courses which contained the largest percentage 
f students accelerated and the smallest number retarded 
yy the school were the classical, academic, and scientific. 
‘hey also contained the largest percentage of students 
ith high average, superior, and very superior intelligence. 
he general, vocational, commercial, and college prepar- 
tory courses, on the other hand, contained the largest 
ercentage of students who had been retarded at some 
ime during their high school course and the smallest 
ercentage who had been accelerated by the school. They 
so contained the smallest proportion of students possess- 
ng the higher grades of intelligence and a larger percent- 
ge possessing the lowest grades of intelligence. 
6. The scientific, college preparatory, and classical 
ourses send the largest percentage of their students to 
‘ollege ; the commercial and vocational courses the small- 
st. The scientific course ranks highest in this regard, the 
commercial course ranks lowest. 
7. Most of the boys pursuing a scientific, vocational, or 
‘ollege preparatory course and going to college expect to 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
158, INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
attend a technical college. What is still more suggestiv 
is the fact that boys graduating from a classical or ac 
demic course also choose a professional and technical co 
lege more frequently than a college of liberal arts. 
very large percentage of those graduating from the gen| 
eral course are undecided in regard to the college they wi 
attend. 
8. Most girls select a college of liberal arts. The larges 
percentage of boys going to liberal arts colleges graduate 
from a commercial, college preparatory, or classical course| 
The courses sending the largest percentage of girls 
liberal arts colleges are the college preparatory, general 
scientific, and classical. 
It is, therefore, not so much the course taken in hig! 
school that determines the occupation and kind of colleg 
chosen by high school seniors as it is some particular stud, 
in that course which appeals specially to their capacitie: 
and interests. This will be brought out more clearly i 
the next chapter. k o

  CHAPTER IX 
TELLIGENCE OF SENIORS PREFERRING DIF- 
FERENT HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
Stvcx the intelligence tests were given near the close of 
lhe senior year, after the students had practically finished 
heir high school course, an opportunity was provided to 
scertain each student’s favorite study and to compare the 
telligence scores of those selecting different high school 
ubjects. To this end each senior was asked to name the 
ubject in his entire high school course which he preferred 
r enjoyed most. Our tabulations were then made in such 
way that the intelligence scores made by the groups 
electing different high school subjects could be compared 
ith each other and with our state standard. The results 
hich follow are from the same group of 5748 seniors whose 
ecords have been used in previous comparisons. All of 
his number except 191 gave full information on this point. 
The subjects chosen by these seniors as favorite studies 
ere classified as follows: (1) Modern language, including 
erman, French, and Spanish; (2) Latin; (3) Mathemat- 
cs, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry; (4) General 
cience, including zodlogy, physical geography, and phys- 
ology; (5) Physics; (6) Chemistry; (7) History and 
tvics, including ancient, European, and American history ; 
8) English and literature; (9) Commercial subjects,

auRE 43.— Scores made by the middle 50 per cent of seniors select- 
ing different high school subjects as their favorite study. 
From this figure it may be seen that the seniors electing 
various foreign language and science subjects rank ahead of 
all other groups, that those electing vocational subjects 
nk lowest, and that those electing history and English 
stand about midway between the other groups. These 
relative rankings are more clearly shown if we compare the 
various favorite-study groups on the basis of the percentage 
belonging to each group who make scores in the mental 
test above the median for our total or standard group. 
The results of this comparison are shown in Table XXVIII.

Combining all language, all science, and all vocational 
subjects and ascertaining the number of seniors belongin; 
to each group rated A or B, we get the following: in th 
group electing a foreign language, 28 per cent possess an 
AorB grade of intelligence ; in the group electing mathe- 
matics or science, 26 per cent; in English, 22 per cent; 
in history, 20 per cent; in vocational subjects, 15 per 
cent. 
If we push our comparison a step further and note the 
percentage preferring each high school subject who are 
rated At or A, the difference in favor of the groups elect- 
ing science and language as their favorite study in high 
school becomes still more marked, as may be seen by a com- 
parison of the figures in Table XXXI. 
The relative number of seniors possessing the highest 
grade of intelligence is almost seven times larger in the 
group electing a language than in the group electing a vo- 
cational subject, and five times as great in the group
-P-A-G-E-183
  INTELLIGENCE AND FAVORITE STUDY 165 
electing a science as in the vocational group.!_ There are 
also fewer students selecting foreign language and science 
who make the lowest (E and F) ratings on the tests. (See 
Table XXXI.) dt therefore appears that the students 
preferring the various foreign language and science sub- 
jects rank highest on the intelligence tests. The seniors 
choosing the various vocational subjects rank lowest.) 
Those selecting English and history rank about midway 
between the other groups.

While this is true of the group taken as a whole it should 
be pointed out that a detailed study of the distribution 
| and frequency tables for these several favorite-study 
groups revealed the following additional facts which seem 
significant : 
1Some allowance must be made for the fact that our various groups 
were of unequal size, which makes these percentages more or less un- 
reliable. But the differences shown seem to occur independently of this 
factor, because they occur where the number of cases are the same. The 
results are, therefore, significant.  
-P-A-G-E-184
    166 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
1. The brightest boys selected mathematics and science 
as their favorite study. 
2. The brightest girls selected Latin and other foreign 
languages. The brightest boys never selected a language 
as their favorite study. 
3. A few of the most superior girls selected English, 
music, art, or even commercial subjects. 
4. The dullest seniors (both boys and girls) selected 
history and English. 
5. Some students choosing mathematics and physics 
dropped very low on the tests, while the average for the 
group was relatively very high. 
6. In the commercial and science subjects the boys are 
far superior to the girls. In the language groups the girls 
clearly outstrip the boys. In the groups selecting history 
and English the boys and girls are about equal in mental 
strength. 
3. Number of students in each favorite-subject group 
ranking at the various intelligence levels. Frequency 
tables were prepared, showing the percentage of boys and 
girls selecting each high school subject who belonged to 
the various intelligence ranks. From these tables fre- 
quency curves were drawn, showing the proportion of boys 
and girls belonging to each favorite-subject group who 
possess each grade of intelligence. All these tables and 
curves cannot be given in this report, but Figure 45 
permits comparison between the seniors selecting foreign 
language as their favorite study in high school and the 
group selecting botany. The figure shows the percentage 
belonging to each group who possess each grade of intelli-
-P-A-G-E-185

gence from A+ to F. The marked superiority of the 
students electing foreign language is shown by the rise of 
the language curve above the botany curve at all points 
indicating the higher grades of intelligence, and its rapid 
and regular descent below this curve at all points repre- 
senting the lower grades of mental ability.

Fiaure 45.— Frequency curves for the seniors selecting botany and 
foreign language as their favorite high school study. They show 
the percentage belonging to each group who possess each grade of 
intelligence found among high school seniors. 
The curves drawn on this basis for the various favorite- 
subject groups picture very clearly the superiority of the 
groups electing language, mathematics, and science over 
the groups choosing English, history, and the various vo- 
cational subjects. They also show in what this superiority 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
    | 
168 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
consists, bringing out taint facts which cannot be pre- 
sented in detail. For example, some subject-groups rank 
high in central tendency but possess few students of supe- 
rior intelligence. Other groups contain a large proportion 
of individuals possessing only average ability, true espe- 
cially for the groups selecting manual training, commercial 
subjects, music and art. Other subject-groups contain 
few or no students with the highest grades of ability, 
about the average number with average ability, and many 
with the lower gradesof intelligence. This is true especially 
for the botany group. Some groups contain seniors with 
all grades of mental ability. For some of these groups the 
general level of the group was low (commercial-subjects 
group) and for others high (mathematics group). 
4. Sex differences. As already indicated some im- 
portant sex differences were revealed by the above com- 
parisons. The brightest boys elected mathematics and 
science; the brightest girls, foreign language.| The 
seniors selecting English, history, and the various voca- 
tional subjects showed little difference between the sexes, 
i.e. only the normal amount shown throughout the study. 
Comparing the record made by the boys and girls elect- 
ing the same favorite studies on the basis of central tend- 
ency, we get the results pictured in Figures 46 and 47. 
Figure 46 shows the record made by the boys and girls 
electing the same high school studies, and as in previous 
comparisons the horizontal bars indicate the record made 
by the middle 50 per cent of the group, which may be 
compared with our state standard shown at the top of 
the figure. The vertical cross-bars indicate the median 
score for the several groups.

In such studies as mathematics, science, chemistry, 
commercial subjects, language, and agriculture, there is a 
marked difference in the intelligence of the sexes choosing 
the same subject. For the agricultural and language 
groups the girls are ahead, and for the other subjects the 
boys make the best intelligence rating. The seniors elect- 
ing, history, English, and the various vocational subjects 
are more uniform in mental strength. That is to say, 
the difference between the sexes here corresponds more 
closely to the degree of superiority that has been shown 
by the boys throughout this study.

The outstanding facts revealed by this comparison of 
he sexes are the following : 
1. The brightest boys show a decided preference for 
athematics and science; the brightest girls for foreign 
language.    
     
-P-A-G-E-192
  174 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
2. More boys (26 per cent) prefer mathematics tha 
any other subject, the largest percentage of girls (28 p 
cent) prefer English and literature. 
3. More than half of the seniors taking the tests ca: 
from the rural districts of the state. Notwithstandin| 
this fact, only 3 per cent of the boys selected agricultu 
as their favorite study in high school, and these made th 
lowest intelligence rating on the tests made by any senior: 
Only 5 per cent of the girls selected domestic science 
their favorite study, while more than 12 per cent of t 
girls selected commercial subjects. The results sugge: 
that the high schools of the state are educating the boy 
and girls away from the home and farm. 
4, The boys electing commercial subjects made rel; 
tively high intelligence ratings on the tests, while the girl 
selecting the same subjects made low ratings. This sug} 
gests that the boys are taking the commercial courses i 
preparation for business, while the girls take them in orde! 
to become stenographers. ‘This is further indicated b: 
the fact that 64 per cent of the boys selecting commercial! 
subjects stated that they were going to college, as compar 
with only 22 per cent of the girls selecting the same sul 
jects. 
5. Effect of favorite study upon the choice of an oc- 
cupation. We also desired to determine the effect of th 
favorite high school subject upon the choice of a voca 
tion in life. The results of this comparison for the boy

An inspection of this table shows that there is 
close relation between the occupation selected and a 
udent’s favorite study. While there are some signs of 
imless choosing, it will be noted that the subjects chosen 
repare in the main for the life occupations selected. For 
xample, the favorite studies of the majority of the 426 
joys who had decided to become mechanical, electrical, 
ivil, mining, and chemical engineers were mathematics, 
hysics, and science; of the group who had decided upon 
business career: mathematics, commercial subjects,
-P-A-G-E-194
    176 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
history, and science ; for the physician group the favori' 
studies were science, history, physics, and chemistry; f 
the lawyer group: history, English, and debating ; for t 
farmers: mathematics, agriculture, history, and physic 
for the journalists: English, foreign language, and histor: 
for the skilled mechanics: mathematics, history, and v 
cational subjects; for chemists: chemistry, mathematic 
and physics; for scientists: science and mathematic: 
and for ministers: English, mathematics, history, a 
chemistry. 
(Our results show that the subjects to which the studen 
are introduced in high school, especially those that appe 
to their native capacities and interests, have a marked an| 
determining influence upon their vocational choice.) Thi 
argues strongly in favor of having considerable pr 
vocational or try-out work in the early part of a boy 
high school course. 
6. Influence of favorite study upon college intentio: 
We desired to know also what relation existed betwee 
the special interests that our seniors expressed in certai 
high school studies and their desire to go to college. Wer 
the students preferring certain high school studies mor 
likely to go to college than students preferring other sul 
jects? What were the favorite studies of the studen 
going to college in the largest numbers and of those wh 
did not expect to attend? 
Table XXXV suggests answers to these questions a 
follows : 
1. The girls preferring foreign language, English, anc 
history are going to college in the greatest numbers. Thos

   electing domestic science, music and art, agriculture, a 
science are least likely to go. 
2. The boys whose favorite subjects are mathemati 
science, and language are going to college in greater nui 
bers than those electing agriculture, manual trainin, 
botany, and commercial subjects. 
3. The largest percentage of boys from practically eve! 
group have decided to go to a professional or techni: 
school. Most of the girls are going to colleges of liber 
arts. 
4, The boys selecting mathematics, science, chemistr; 
physics, agriculture, and manual training are going to 
technical or professional college in largest number: 
Many electing English, history, Latin, commercial sul 
jects, music and art are going to colleges of liberal art 
The latter groups also contain the largest percentage 
students who were undecided in regard to the colleg} 
they expected to attend. 
7. General résumé of results. 1. If the sexes ar 
combined and the groups selecting different favorite sub} 
jects are considered as units, foreign language, mathe 
matics, and science subjects are regularly preferred b; 
the brightest seniors in the state. The vocational sub 
jects are regularly chosen by the dullest. English an 
history occupy a position about midway between the 
language and science groups on the one hand and the 
vocational groups on the other. These conditions hold 
whether we make our comparisons on the basis ot 
central tendency or on the basis of the percentage belong- 
ing to each group who make the highest mental rating on

    e tests. Of those selecting language 57 per cent made 
res above the state median; of those electing science, 
per cent; English, 50 per cent; history, 47 per cent; 
cational subjects, 42 per cent. Comparing these several 
‘oups on the basis of the range of intelligence possessed 
the members of each group, we find that 28 per cent of 
ose electing foreign language made an intelligence grade 
A or B. Of those electing science or mathematics 26 
r cent were rated A or B; English, 22 per cent; history, 
per cent; vocational subjects, 15 per cent. If we com- 
e those rated At or A, we find that about seven times 
many students electing language or science belong 
these superior intelligence groups as were found among 
e groups electing vocational subjects. 
2. The students making the highest intelligence scores 
hiefly boys) selected mathematics and science as their 
vorite study in high school. The most superior boys 
ever selected a language as their favorite study. The 
rightest girls selected a foreign language as their favorite 
tudy in high school. 
3. A few of the brightest seniors in the state selected 
nglish, music, or art (girls), and manual training and 
mmercial subjects (boys). 
4. Taken as a whole, comparatively few seniors selected 
oreign language as their favorite study —less than 3 per 
ent of the boys (2.51 per cent) and only about 11 per cent 
»f the girls (10.98 per cent). More boys preferred mathe- 
natics (26 per cent) than any other subject. The largest 
yercentage of girls selected English as their favorite study 
n high school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
      180 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
5. Few boys (8 per cent) selected agriculture an 
only 5 per cent of the eile selected domestic science| 
while 12.29 per cent selected commercial subjects. Mor 
than half of our seniors came from the rural and agri 
cultural districts of the state. 
6. There is a marked difference in the mental strengt 
of the boys and girls selecting the same favorite subject. 
The boys selecting mathematics, chemistry, commercia 
subjects, and general science are far superior in general 
intelligence to the girls selecting the same subjects. I 
the foreign language and agricultural groups the girls ar 
superior to the boys. The boys and girls selecting history. 
English, and the various vocational subjects are abou 
equal in mental strength. 
7. That a senior’s favorite high school study has som 
effect in determining his choice of a vocation is shown b: 
the fact that the subjects chosen as favorite studies pr 
pare more or less directly for the occupations selected, 
This points to the importance of introducing high school 
students to a rather varied field of work in the early part 
of their high school course in order to ascertain their vo- 
cational capacities and interests. 
8) Because of the influence of the favorite study on 
vocational choice and its relation to the type of work done 
in college, the student’s favorite study in high school 
seems to influence his college intention and his selection 
of a college course. The girls who prefer language, Eng- 
lish, and history are going to college in the greatest num- 
bers and they are going to colleges of liberal arts. Those 
electing domestic science, music and art, agriculture, and
-P-A-G-E-199
INTELLIGENCE AND FAVORITE STUDY 181 
  general science are least likely to go to college. The boys 
whose favorite subjects are mathematics, science, and 
foreign language are going to college in greater numbers 
than those electing agriculture, manual training, botany, 
and commercial subjects. The former also select pro- 
fessional or technical schools. Most of the boys going to 
colleges of liberal arts select English, history, Latin, 
commercial subjects, music and art. These favorite- 
subject groups also contain most of the boys who had not 
decided what college they would attend. 
8. Discussion of results. Some of the educational 
implications of these facts should be briefly pointed 
out. The fact that the brightest students select: mathe- 
matics, science, or language as their favorite studies 
and that students selecting vocational subjects rank 
lowest in the mental tests may be interpreted in a 
number of ways. It may mean that the brightest and 
most ambitious students in high school have been 
directed by parents and teachers into the courses which 
feature these traditional subjects. In other words, it is 
fashionable for the best students to take the academic, 
classical, or scientific courses, while the duller students 
may naturally drift into a vocational course; or they may 
try the academic courses without success and be forced 
into the others. It may also be true that the brighter 
students are more consistently bent upon going into the 
professions, because of their home environment, or the 
advice of their associates, and so are urged to take a course 
in high school which gives the traditional preparation for 
these so-called learned professions and for a college course.

182 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
The fact that students are going to our high schools and 
colleges in ever increasing numbers and that a senior’s 
choice of a favorite study in high school seems to have 
such a marked influence upon his choice of an occupation 
and his college intention, may well make us question 
whether the high school, as it is now organized and con- 
ducted, adequately meets the vocational inclinations and 
needs of all of its students. 
The fact that the brightest seniors in the state were 
boys, that these brightest boys select mathematics and 
science as their favorite study in high school, and that a 
larger percentage of boys select mathematics than any other 
study, while the brightest girls select foreign language as 
their favorite study (five times as many girls selecting 
foreign language as boys), and that the largest percentage 
of girls select English and literature as their favorite 
study —all point in the direction of fundamental sex differ- 
ences that are doubtless significant. If taken in conjunc- 
tion with the facts revealed in Chapter V showing the 
grades of intelligence possessed by the seniors which the 
school actually accelerates and retards, it points clearly to 
the need for a better adaptation of the instruction of the 
high school to the interests, mental capacities, and needs 
of the boys. There is much evidence in this study that 
the high schools do not meet the needs of the boys as well 
as the needs of the girls. This may help to explain why 
the girls attend them in ever increasing numbers and out- 
strip the boys in application to the work and in securing 
successful school marks. 
The fact that the various subjects which the student
-P-A-G-E-201
INTELLIGENCE AND FAVORITE STUDY 183 
  studies in high school, particularly the study which he 
most enjoys, has so much to do with his choice of an oc- 
cupation and helps to determine whether or not he will go 
to college as well as his selection of a college points pretty 
conclusively either to a need for prevocational work in 
the early part of the high school course, or to a change in 
the nature of the work given, so that each student would 
be able to “find himself,” as it were vocationally, by 
coming into contact with several representative lines of 
work. When considered in connection with the facts re- 
vealed in Chapter VII, which show how few lines of work 
were chosen by this large group of high school seniors, we 
must conclude that if our facts have any significance at 
all they mean that the high schools are not adequately 
meeting the needs of the heterogeneous group of young 
people who now attend them. They are unintentionally 
piloting these young people towards a few lines of work and 
are not providing the means either to help them find the 
work in life for which they have special mental capacity, 
or to prepare for it. 
It is also significant that only 3 per cent of the boys 
elected agriculture as their favorite study in high school 
and only 5 per cent of the girls selected domestic science, 
while more than 12 per cent of the girls selected commer- 
cial subjects. When we consider that more than half of 
our total group of seniors come from the rural and agri- 
cultural districts of the state these facts seem particularly 
significant and should at least make us raise the question 
whether the high schools as now organized and conducted 
are not in fact educating our boys and girls away from
-P-A-G-E-202
184 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
| the home and farm instead of preparing them on a high 
plane for these important kinds of work. We should ask 
whether the courses of study in the rural high schools 
of the state contain what these pupils really need and 
should be taught. 
The results of this section give a new social significance 
to the high school curriculum and indicate the direction 
in which we must look to make the needed readjustments.

CHAPTER X 
INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS REPRE- 
SENTING DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONAL CLASSES 
  In most civilized countries various types of secondary 
schools have developed to meet the needs of different 
social and occupational classes. The English public 
school, the Lycée of France, and the Gymnasium, Real- 
Gymnasium, and Real-Schule in Germany are examples. 
In America a single system of public schools, extending 
from the kindergarten and elementary schools through the 
high school to the state university, has been developed 
for our entire population. Social and economic barriers 
have been broken down. The American high school is, in 
theory at least, the people’s school, organized and con- 
ducted to meet the needs of all social andoccupational 
classes. This being the case, we desired to discover 
(1) whether all ‘occupational and economic classes were 
actually represented in the graduating classes of Indiana 
high schools; (2) whether the number of seniors belonging 
to each occupational class was about in the proportion 
that the relative size of the various occupational groups 
in the state would lead us to expect; in other words, 
whether each occupational group had its full quota of 
students in the high school or whether the high schools 
were being patronized more by certain occupational or 
185
-P-A-G-E-204
    186 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
social classes than by others; (3) whether there are any 
inequalities in intelligence between the seniors coming 
from these several occupational and economic classes. 
In order to obtain the facts needed to make such com- 
parisons each senior was asked to give his father’s occu- 
pation and annual salary. In case either of these items 
could not be accurately specified by the pupil, the in- 
formation was obtained and recorded by the teacher 
giving the examination, and this fact noted in her final 
report to us. In every case the teacher or principal giving 
the examination was asked to verify these items. Tabu- 
lations were then made in such a way that the intelligence 
scores made by the seniors coming from each occupational 
class might be compared with one another and with the 
state standard. The intelligence scores of the students 
belonging to various economic groups were also determined 
and compared with each other and with our state standard. 
The results of this latter comparison will be presented in 
the following chapter. 
1. Occupational groups represented in the senior 
classes of Indiana high schools. The occupations of 
parents reported by the seniors taking the tests were 
classified into the following seven groups: 
1. Professional, including teachers, physicians and sur- 
geons, musicians and teachers of music, clergymen, law- 
yers, judges, dentists, editors, civil and electrical engineers, 
architects, etc. 
2. Clerical workers, including bookkeepers, cashiers, ac- 
countants, stenographers, typists, shipping clerks, secre- 
taries, collectors, etc.
-P-A-G-E-205
  
INTELLIGENCE AND FATHER’S OCCUPATION 187 
3. Salesmen and clerks, including clerks and salesmen 
in stores, retail dealers, commercial travelers, brokers and 
agents, deliverymen, lumber and coal yard employees, ete. 
4. Skilled artisans, including all skilled workers in the 
various trades, such as carpenters, painters, plumbers, 
machinists, blacksmiths, stonecutters, bakers, typesetters, 
engravers, and jewelers. 
5. Business executives and foremen, including all 
executives and managers in the various manufacturing 
and trade pursuits. 
6. Day laborers, all semi-skilled laborers in the va- 
rious manufacturing and trade pursuits, including farm 
laborers. 
7. Farmers, all persons engaged in general farming, 
gardening, or stock raising on a productive or managerial 
basis. 
2. Number of high school seniors belonging to each 
occupational class. Ninety-one per cent of all seniors 
taking the tests gave information sufficiently definite 
and accurate concerning the occupation of their father to 
be of use in the comparisons of this section. The loss of 
the 9 per cent was due to the fact that many whose 
fathers were dead merely mentioned this fact without 
naming his former occupation ; others answered the ques- 
tion too vaguely for the results to be of value. A few 
teachers failed to verify or to supply the missing data on 
this point. The 5249 individuals who furnished reliable 
information concerning the occupation of their fathers 
were distributed among these various occupational groups 
as shown in Table XXXVI.

The table shows the percentage of the total population 
of the state engaged in remunerative or productive work 
who belong to these several occupational groups.’ 
From a comparison of the figures presented in this 
table it will be seen that the percentage of seniors whose 
parents belong to each of thesé occupational groups cor- 
responds roughly to the number of persons actually en- 
gaged in these occupations in the state for the following 
occupational groups: professional, clerical workers, sales- 
men and clerks, and artisans. The business executive 
group is twice as large as we should expect. The day 
laborer group had only about one-third its normal quota 
of students in last year’s senior classes. Aside from these 
two occupational groups the parallel is rather close, sug- 
gesting that Indiana high schools are succeeding very 
largely in their democratic appeal to all social and oc-

to the various occupational groups represented in the high school were

upational groups represented in the state. The children 
rom all classes do attend the high schools of the state and 
lo graduate, but not in the right proportions. Parents 
elonging to the professional, clerical, and salesmen groups 
eem to have about their proper quota of graduates. 
farmers and business executives seem to have more than 
heir quota. The skilled artisan and day laborer groups 
em to have less than their normal quota. 
3. Intelligence of seniors belonging to each occu- 
ational class. But a matter of greater interest and im- 
ortance than the proportion of seniors belonging to each 
ccupational group is the general level of intelligence of 
he seniors coming from these different occupational classes. 
t has been assumed by many economists that there is a 
irect relation between the native mental endowment of in- 
ividuals and their occupational or economic status in the 
community ; that different occupational classes represent, 
n a sense, fundamental differences in native mental 
lability which in diverse ways have determined their occu- 
ational selection and economic status.! In fact so deep 
rooted is this belief that one of the criteria used by social 
workers for detecting feeblemindedness in an individual is 
his economic status and occupational success. 
We wished, therefore, to determine (1) the general 
level of intelligence of the seniors coming from each occu- 
pational group; (2) the range of intelligence or grades of 
native mental ability which each of these groups actually 
possessed; and (8) the relative frequency within each

group of the various grades of intelligence found among hig 
school seniors. If, for example, it should be found th: 
each occupational group had about the same percentage 
students making the highest intelligence scores obtained b 
high school seniors, this fact would have far-reaching soci: 
and educational significance. If, on the other hand, o 
results should show marked differences between the gener: 
levels of mental ability possessed by different occupatio: 
groups, this fact would be theoretically and practical; 
significant. 
(a) General level of intelligence of the seniors representi 
different occupational classes. The mental tests given i 
“the army revealed great differences between the scor 
made by the men belonging to different occupation 
groups. Of the 36,500 cases grouped by occupations it 
a recently published report, the farmers and day laborer| 
ranked very lowonthe mental tests. Themedical and engij 
neering officers, stenographers, and ministers, on the othe 
hand, ranked high. 
Ina study from the Psychological Laboratory of Indian: 
University, wide divergences were found between th 
intelligence scores made by children whose fathers belonge 
to different occupational classes.1_ Children whose parent: 
belong to the professional class make much higher score 
on the intelligence tests than do the children of parent: 
belonging to the artisan or day laborer classes. The per 
centages of children representing various occupations wh 
made scores above the median for the total group teste

  ere as follows: professional 85, business and industrial 
ecutives 68, skilled tradesmen 41, day laborers 39. 
hese figures were obtained from all children 10 to 14 
ears of age in a community where school attendance was 
mpulsory. The results should, therefore, be more re- 
ably indicative of the real differences which exist between 
ese various occupational groups than the results we ob- 
ined from high school seniors, because children from 
rtain occupational classes may not attend high school 
t all, and children from other occupational groups might 
ot be able to graduate from high school if they did attend. 
he results of the study referred to, cannot, however, be 
aken as truly representative since they were obtained 
‘om children in a single community which, being the seat 
f the state university, was overweighted with representa- 
ives of the professional class. The results are, neverthe- 
$s, significant and should be considered in ccnnection 
ith the data gathered in the army, and the results ob- 
ained in the present study of the intelligence of 6188 high 
chool seniors from all parts of the state, and representing 
Il the occupational groups listed above. 
As previously stated all seniors taking the test were re- 
rouped on the basis of the occupations of their fathers. 
‘he intelligence scores made by these various occupational 
roups were then compared on the basisof central tendency. 
e results are shown in Figure 50, which indicates the 
ecord made by the middle 50 per cent of the seniors be- 
longing to each occupational class. The data are so pre- 
mted that the record made by any occupational group 
ay readily be compared with the state standard or with
-P-A-G-E-210
192 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
the record of any other occupational group. As ma; 
readily be seen, there are marked differences between th 
general level of mental ability among these several occu 
pational groups. \The children from professional familie 
rank ahead of all other groups. The children of day la: 
borers and farmers rank lowest and this order remains th 
same whether the sexes are considered singly, or together,

That these differences between occupational groups an 
between the sexes hold for all levels of ability is shown b; 
the percentile curves pictured in Figure 52, which compar 
the records made by the professional and farmer group: 
The curves show the scores made by a definite proportio 
of students belonging to each occupational ‘class, the 5, 1 
20...95 percentile groups. An inspection of the figur 
reveals the fact that the boys rank consistently highe 
than the girls at every level and that the superiority o 
both boys and girls coming from the professional clas: 
is clearly marked. Similar curves were drawn for all 
occupational groups but no additional facts were revealed| 
Sex differences similar to those shown in Table XXXVI 
and in Figures 51 and 52 appear in each group. Th 
significant fact revealed by these curves is that the su 
periority or inferiority of a given group remains constan’ 
for all intellectual levels. 
These results appear all the more noteworthy when w 
reflect that the day laborer group had less than half it: 
normal quota of students in the graduating class. 
(b) Distribution of the brightest and dullest senior: 
among the various occupational groups. A  questio 
of greater sociological and educational importance tha 
the foregoing is that of the presence or absence, i 
each occupational group, of seniors possessing the mos' 
superior grades of mental ability. In which occu 
pational groups were the brightest individuals actuall 
found? What occupational classes contributed mos 
seniors making the highest and lowest mental ratings o: 
our tests? To answer these questions the several group

nging to each group whose mental test score gave them 
ental ratings of At, the highest, and F, the lowest, intel- 
ence grades made by high school seniors. 
Since the day laborer class had less than half its normal 
ota in the senior classes of the high schools tested, we 
ould expect the representatives of this occupation to 
nk higher as a group than the other occupational classes,

rather select group of individuals. From the representa:

Table XX XVIII shows the per cent of seniors belonging] 
to each occupational class who received a mental rating on| 
the tests of A+ or F, and shows that every occupational 
group contains seniors in the At class and every group 
except the clerical workers has representatives in the F 
or lowest intelligence class. From this table and previously 
presented data it appears that every occupational group 
had not only representatives in the senior classes of the 
high school, but had representatives in the group possessing 
the highest grade of mental ability found among the high 
school seniors of the entire state. 
If we consider all the seniors belonging to each occupa- 
tional class who made scores on the mental tests which 
placed them in the swperior or very superior class, we ob-

relative frequency with which each grade of mental ability 
occurred among the seniors representing each occupational

in each occupational group? Are all grades of intelligence 
found in equal proportions? On what grades of intelli-

groups?

records of selected groups are shown in Figures 55 to

the sex curves for the farmer group run almost parallel, 
as do the curves for the clerical group. For the artisan

proportions. 
5. General summary. The more important facts con-

us to expect.

       arked differences appear between the representatives of 
e several occupational groups. The children of profes- 
lonal parentage rank highest in all these comparisons. 
he children from the farmer and day laborer classes rank 
west. The seniors from the other occupational groups 
nk between these extremes. 
4. The boys from each occupational class rank con- 
stently higher than the girls representing the same occu- 
tion, suggesting a natural selection of the brightest boys. 
r certain occupational groups, e.g. the professional, 
‘tisan, and day laborer classes this process of selection has 
emingly taken place to a more marked degree than for 
her occupations. That is to say, the boys rank rela- 
vely higher for these occupational classes than for the 
hers, suggesting that only the brighter boys from these 
cupational classes remain to finish a high school course. 
6. Discussion of results. From the data presented 
this chapter it appears that while all occupational 
asses have representatives in the senior classes of 
e high schools of the state, they are not equally 
ell represented. There are proportionately more than 
wice as many seniors coming from the business execu- 
ive and commercial group as the relative importance 
f this occupation in the state would lead us to expect. 
‘he farmer group also had more than its quota of repre- 
ntatives. The skilled artisan and day laborer classes, on 
e other hand, had fewer representatives than we should 
xpect. To what is this inequality due? Why is the day 
borer and skilled artisan class less adequately represented 
han it should be and why do farmers and business men  
-P-A-G-E-224
    206 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
have more than their share of representatives in the grad 
ating classes of Indiana high schools? Is the reason fina: 
cial? The business men of the state are the money make 
and the farmers are certainly well able to send their childr 
to high school. Is the inequality due to a lack of ment: 
ability on the part of the children coming from the dal 
laborer class? Our distribution tables showed that th 
occupational group had proportionately about as many re} 
resentatives possessing the highest grade of intelligen 
found among high school seniors as any other occupation 
group, though the general level of ability of the group w: 
next to the lowest (farmer group). If the law of the sw 
vival of the fittest operates, it would mean that the rath 
low level of mental ability of the children of this occup: 
tional class was still lower than our figures show. Th 
rather full representation from the business and farme' 
groups would help to account for the poor mental showin 
made by these occupational groups on the tests. Or shal 
we say that the unequal representation of the several occu 
pational groups means that our high schools are bette 
adapted to the needs of the professional, clerical, and busi 
ness groups than to those of the artisan and day labore 
classes ? 
Perhaps the most important circumstance revealed b; 
this chapter is the fact that all occupational groups are a 
tually represented in the senior classes of our high schools! 
This shows that our high schools are democratic in a real 
sense and means that every effort should be made to adapt 
their work to the variety of interests and vocational needs 
which a democratic society presents.
-P-A-G-E-225
TELLIGENCE .AND FATHER’S OCCUPATION 207 
  The inequalities in mental strength found among the 
presentatives of these various occupational groups is a 
dition of special interest and far-reaching significance. 
he evidence is clear that there are marked differences 
tween individuals belonging to various occupational 
asses — differences which by heredity manifest them- 
Ives in the children of the various occupational groups 
ho attend our public schools. This means that the work 
the public schools, to be truly democratic, must be ad- 
sted to these individual differences in ability as well as 
apted to the needs of individuals varying so greatly in 
e occupations which they will follow in later life. Ina 
hool which presumably serves all the people it will not 
ffice to set up a traditional course of study fashioned for 
d adapted to the needs and interests of a few occupa~ 
onal groups. The schools must be adapted to the mental 
equalities and varying interests of the entire pop- 
lation. 
The importance of the economic side of the problem 
ill be shown in the following chapter. If later 
vestigations should show that the reason for the 
oor representation from the day laborer class in our 
igh schools is chiefly financial, this discovery will be ex- 
remely significant. If a real difference in mental ability 
xists, this fact is equally important. Even as the case 
ow stands there is abundant evidence to show that 
any who are now mere “hewers of wood and drawers 
f water” have the native mental ability to do some of 
he highest types of work, but are bound down by 
conomic conditions and the law of habit over which they

rave no control, and so are totally unable to take 
lines of work better suited to their native interes’ 
and intellectual strength. As will be shown in t 
following chapter mere wealth is no guarantee of intelle 
tual endowment.

CHAPTER XI 
TELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS REP- 
RESENTING DIFFERENT ECONOMIC CLASSES 
    
          
   
         A question of considerable importance is the relation 
hat exists between the intelligence of high school seniors 
nd the economic status of their parents. Are the most 
telligent people in the state also the wealthiest? Does 
require a high degree of native mental ability to accu- 
ulate wealth? Is a high yearly income a sure index of 
uperior intelligence? What economic groups have the 
est mentally endowed children in the high school? If 
ental ability is inherited, as is generally assumed, a com- 
arison of the mental ratings made by the seniors belonging 
‘o the different economic groups actually represented in 
he high school should give important information bearing 
n these points. Such intelligence rankings can, however, 
e considered only as they pertain to the product of the 
high schools which in all probability are not truly repre- 
sentative of all economic classes. 
To enable us to compare the representatives of different 
economic groups each senior taking the intelligence tests 
was asked to state the yearly income of his father during 
the year previous to the examination. In case this was 
not known, the student was asked to give an estimate and 
to indicate in his answer that it was an estimate. This 
item was afterwards checked by the principal or teacher 
in charge of the mental examination, who was asked to 
verify the student’s statement. Reliable answers were

  secured from 4346 of the 5748 seniors used in these co’ 
parative studies, 1898 boys and 2448 girls. The othe 
either failed to answer this question or gave ambiguou| 
information, which was discarded.

To make a comparison possible between the representa: 
tives of different economic classes we grouped them as fol- 
lows: (1) those whose parents’ annual income ranged from 
$4500 to $12,000 or more; (2) those having a yearly in- 
come of $3000 to $4500; (3) those earning $2000 to 
$3000 per year; (4) those making from $1000 to $2000 
per year; (5) those having an annual income of $500 to 
$1000 per year. Tabulations were then made in such a 
way that the test scores made by the students belonging 
to each of these economic groups could be compared with 
one another and with our total or standard group.!' Table 
1 We have no figures showing the number of family heads there were in 
the state in 1918-19 who had these different grades of income. But the 
percentage of seniors who belong to each class is significant. It will be 
seen that almost half the group belong to class four (annual income 
$1000 to $2000) and one-fourth to class five (annual income less than 
$1000).

   L shows the per cent of seniors belonging to the various 
conomic groups. 
These several ecomomic groups were compared (1) on 
he basis of the general level of intelligence possessed by 
ach group; (2) on the basis of the number of seniors 
elonging to each group who possessed the highest grades 
f intelligence ; and (3) on the basis of the frequency with 
hich these several grades of intelligence occurred among 
he members of each group. The results of these com- 
arisons are presented in tables and curves, which follow. 
1. General level of ability of the seniors belonging 
o different economic groups. The groups were first 
compared: on the basis of the scores made by the middle 
50 per cent of the individuals belonging to each 
leconomic group. The results of this comparison are 
shown in Figure 60, which enables us to compare the 
records made by the middle 50 per cent of each group 
with each other and with our state standard. There is 
but little difference between the intelligence of the in- 
dividuals representing the first four groups. There is, 
however, a marked difference between the records made by 
the seniors belonging to these high-income groups and 
those whose parents’ income was less than $1000 per year. 
The same fact is shown in another way if we compare 
these several groups on the basis of the per cent belonging 
to each who made scores on the intelligence tests above 
the state median. These figures are given in Table XLI. 
If the sexes are combined, we get a slight but continuous 
decline as we pass from the highest to the lowest salaried 
group, and a marked decline for the lowest salaried group.  
-P-A-G-E-230
SRE i A AT a | aaa le een ei | 
212 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
But the most significant fact revealed by the latter com 
parison is the marked difference which appears betwee 
the records made by the boys and girls coming fro 
the wealthier groups. Nearly 9 per cent more boys tha: 
girls belonging to the two highest salaried groups mad 
scores above the state median. (Compare Figure 60 an 
Table XLI.) This same fact is shown in Figure 60 by th 
comparatively low median score made by the girls rep 
resenting the wealthier groups. For the groups repre 
senting parents whose annual incomes range from $500 t 
$1000 and $2000 to $3000 we find only the usual amoun 
of difference between the records made by the boys an 
girls. For the highest income groups the boys mak 
records far superior to those of the girls.

2. Location of the brightest seniors. When we deter- 
ine which economic group furnished the largest percent- 
ge of seniors possessing the higher grades of intelli- 
ence we secure different results. All economic groups 
xcept the highest salaried group are represented in the 
highest one percentile class. Table XLII shows the 
percentage of students belonging to each economic group 
whose mental test score gave them a rating of At or A, 
the highest gratles made on the tests, also the percentage 
making a mental rating of E- or F, the lowest grades of 
intelligence possessed by our total or standard group. 
Groups 2, 3, and 4, where the income varied from $1000 
to $4500, have the largest percentage of seniors rated At, 
and groups 1 and 5 the smallest. Groups 3 and 4 are 
superior to group 2 in the per cent of students rated 
At or A. 
From a study of our distribution tables it appears that 
neither group 1 nor group 5 contain students who score 
above 180 points in the tests. But seniors possessing 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
214 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
this grade of ability were found in each of the other eco: 
nomic groups. The brightest students belong to group 4 
the annual income of whose parents ranged from $10 
to $2000. Eight students belonging to this group, 6 boy: 
and 2 girls, made scores over 185. And 5 students i 
our lowest economic group (annual income $500 to $1000 
made scores ranging from 175 to 180, while there was bu 
a single student in our highest salaried group who made 
score above 175 points.

frequency with which these grades of intelligence occurred 
among the individuals belonging to different groups. 
Table XLIII combines certain of these results and 
shows that more students belonging to the wealthiest 
class made scores above the state median than was the 
case for any other group, but that a relatively large pro- 
portion of these students were only rated C+. This is 
clearly shown by the frequency curves for this group given 
in Figure 63, which compares group 1 (annual income over 
$4500) with group 5 (annual income $500 to $1000). 
The curve for group 1 rises above the other curve at all 
points indicating the higher grades of mental ability and 
drops below it at all points indicating the lower grades of 
intelligence. An unusually large percentage of individuals 
belonging to group 1 are rated Ct, as is shown by the 
height of the curve at that point.

brought out by this comparison of different economi 
groups may be summarized as follows: 
1. The brightest seniors did not come from the wealth. 
ier groups. Children of parents in moderate economi 
circumstances (annual income $1000 to $2000) rank 
highest on the mental tests. (See Table XLII.) But th 
wealthier homes furnish more seniors of average and hig! 
average ability than do the humbler homes.) 
2. Only slight differences were found between the intel 
ligence of the students coming from homes where the an 
nual income varied from $1000 to $12,000, but marke 
differences were found among the intelligence levels foi 
these groups and the group coming from homes where| 
the annual income was below $1000 per year. The latter 
group rated decidedly below the other groups in the per| 
cent making grades above the state median, in median 
score, and in the percentage possessing the highest (A or 
B) grades of intelligence. 
3. All economic classes had representatives in the high 
school and among the group rated At on the intelligence 
tests. Taken as a whole the seniors endowed best men- 
tally belong to groups 3 and 4.

  CHAPTER XIT 
TELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS COMING 
‘ROM DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS 
Inprvipvau differences found among school children, 
gh school students, and adults — differences in mental 
pacity or ability to learn, in vital capacity or endurance, 
ability to recover from fatigue, in the strength and kind 
special abilities possessed — are now clearly recognized 
all and have been much studied. But the fact that 
ere are differences between growps of individuals which 
e important for a correct solution of many of our social 
d educational problems has been recognized by only a 
w. Differences between children in the same grade but 
tending different schools, differences between the chil- 
en attending different buildings in the same city, differ- 
ces between schools located in different communities, 
ifferences between various social and occupational 
‘oups — these group differences while as marked and 
aried as those found among individuals are only beginning 
be investigated. 
The importance of these group differences will be recog- 
ized as soon as they are pointed out and the fact of their 
istence demonstrated. Take for example the matter of 
igh school accrediting. We have been working on the 
eory in Indiana that high schools located in every part

The efficiency and achievements of these high schools ha: 
been evaluated by our high school inspectors wholly

inequalities in the native mental strength of pupils. 
have been considered equal and recommended for co: 
missions to the state board of education if they have m 
the standard requirements regarding equipment and t! 
character and training of their teaching force. The resu 
is that the accomplishment of a “one-talent” school hi 
been judged by the same standards as a “ten-talent 
school. Furthermore, our colleges and universities ha 
been working on the theory that all high schools so stan 
ardized would provide satisfactory material for the colleg 
provided they safeguarded their courses of study, ti 
training of their teachers, and made sure that their materi: 
equipment and the character of the instruction was up t¢ 
standard. Little attention has been given to the matt 
of obtaining real standards for evaluating the product 
these high schools or for measuring their accomplishment 
That vital differences might be found among the pupi 
in these schools has not been taken into consideration. 
If such group inequalities exist, they should be dete: 
mined and the character and degree of difference pointed ou 
That such group differences between sections of the sam 
grade, between schools in different communities, and be 
tween individual schools do exist has been shown by inves

ations from our own laboratory.! We therefore desired 
measure and describe in this study such inequalities 
the native mental endowment of high school seniors 
resenting different communities and different individual 
ools, as might be found to exist. We wished to acquaint 
chers and school officials with these differences in order 
at they might better adjust the work of their schools 
the varying capacities and needs of their pupils. 
Several different kinds of comparisons will be made in 
is chapter: (1) the intelligence of seniors coming from 
igh schools of different sizes or ranks; (2) the intelli- 
nce of seniors coming from the northern, central, and 
uthern sections of the state; (3) the intelligence of sen- 
's coming from rural and city high schools; (4) the intelli- 
nce of seniors representing strictly agricultural, manufac- 
ring, and mining communities; (5) the intelligence of 
niors coming from the best and the worst economic sec- 
ns of the state; (6) the grades of intelligence possessed 
seniors coming from individual schools of the same size 
d rank but located in different parts of the state; 
) the intelligence of seniors from high schools located 
the same city or county ; (8) the distribution of different 
ades of intelligence among the seniors of different indi- 
dual schools; (9) the location and geographical dis- 
ribution of the ablest seniors found in the state will be

and a southern section, as is shown on the map in Figure 
The individual schools were then grouped into eight diff 
ent ranks, based upon the size of their senior class. 
schools whose senior class consisted of 100 or more studet 
were classed as rank 1; schools whose senior class nu 
bered from 75 to 100 were given rank 2; 50 to 74, rank 
35 to 49, rank 4; 20 to 34, rank 5; 10 to 19, rank 6; 6 
9, rank 7; and 1 to 5, rank 8. Table XLIV shows t 
number of schools belonging to each of these ranks. 
To determine all inequalities in mental strength fow 
in the individual high schools of the state, we retabulat 
the intelligence scores made by the senior class of ea 
school. This enabled us to compare not merely individu} 
schools of the same rank in different cities, counties, co! 
munities, and sections of the state, but to ascertain t! 
different grades of intelligence that were found in the seni 
classes of different schools and to see how different grad 
of mental ability were distributed in any particular schoo: 
The facts revealed by these various comparisons are pr 
sented below.

      We next made a comparison between the smaller and 
e larger schools of the state. This showed more clearly the 
periority of the city schools belonging to ranks 2, 3, and 
Our data show that these schools possess better senior 
aterial than the schools of any other rank. That is to 
, a greater percentage of the seniors coming from these 
hools are ranked A or B on the intelligence tests than 
ere found in any other rank of high school. There are 
so more seniors in these schools who make scores above 
e state median (60 per cent) as against 53 per cent in 
e larger city schools, their nearest competitors. They 
lso excel in median score. The median score for all the 
chools ranked 2, 3, and 4 is 141.21, or 4.21 points higher 
han for the schools ranked 1, which stood next to this rank. 
t will also be seen by consulting Table XLIV that there are 
elatively more seniors belonging to these ranks who made 
cores in the mental tests entitling them to an intelligence 
rade of A+, and that the proportion of these highly 
ndowed individuals was about the same in each of these 
anks. The smallest schools in the state, those ranked 7 
nd 8, come next. Rank 3 had the largest percentage of 
tudents rated A or B, 31.46 per cent. The schools ranked 
had a smaller percentage of seniors rated A or B than 
ither rank 2 or 3. But it had more students rated Ct+ 
han any other rank. The schools belonging to rank 2 had 
ore students rated C or C-, which made the percentage 
f students belonging to each of these three ranks scoring 
bove the state median about equal, as we have noted 
bove. Taken as a whole, however, and comparing the 
several ranks not merely on the basis of central tendency

    but on the proportion of seniors belonging to such ra 
who possess each grade of intelligence, the schools ranke 
3 made the best showing, and those ranked 6 the wor:

2. Intelligence of seniors coming from the northe:

made on the intelligence tests by seniors from all school 
located in the northern, central, and southern parts o| 
the state were compared on the same basis as has bee! 
used throughout this report. These sections are kno 
to be different in important economic respects and i 
was thought likely that they might be equally differen’ 
from a psychological point of view. The division o: 
the state into sections was made as indicated on the 
map shown in Figure 80. The more important result: 
obtained by the sectional comparison presented in detai 
in Table XLVI, and summarized in Table XLVI, ar  
-P-A-G-E-247

s follows: (1) All types of schools in the northern part 
f the state are superior to the schools of corresponding 
ank in the southern section; (2) northern schools of 
lall rank save 7 and 3 are superior in the native mental 
lendowment of their senior classes to the schools of the 
central section; (3) the schools of the central section 
lare slightly superior to the schools of the southern section 
for all ranks except 5,6, and 1. The difference in favor 
of the schools in the southern section ranked 5 and 6 is 
very slight, almost negligible. For rank 1 there is but a 
single school in the southern part of the state which 
stands decidedly higher on every basis of comparison than 
the average for schools of a similar rank in the central 
section. (Compare Table XLVI below.)

these sectional differences become more apparent. Table

It should also be pointed out that the schools in the 
northern section are superior to the schools in the southern 
section for every level or grade of ability. This is clearly 
‘shown by the curves in Figure 66, showing the record made 
on the tests by definite proportions of seniors representing 
all the schools in the northern and southern sections. 
The curve for the schools in the northern section is higher 
at every point than the curve representing the schools in 
the southern section. The percentile curve for the schools 
in the central section would, if drawn, pass about midway 
between the curve for the northern and southern sections, 
as might be inferred from the data given in Table XLVII. 
The most striking and significant feature about the curves 
shown in Figure 66 is the great divergence at the lower end 
of the distribution and their gradual convergence at the 
higher levels. This is due to the fact that we find a larger 
proportion of seniors in the schools in the southern part 
of the state with inferior and very inferior mental ability 
than in the northern section, while at the same time the 
range of intelligence for the seniors in the southern section   
 
-P-A-G-E-250

of the state extends higher than for the northern section, 
there being more senjors with very superior mental ability 
in the smaller schools of the southern part of the state than 
in the schools of the northern section.

3. Intelligence of seniors coming from rural and ci 
high schools. The returns from schools drawing fro 
80 to 100 per cent of their students from the country (13' 
schools) were next compared with city schools, ranks 2, 3 
and 4. The distribution of the various grades of intelli 
gence among the senior students in these two types o 
schools is shown in Table XLVIII. To call attention t 
the rather marked difference in mental endowment po! 
sessed by the students belonging to these two types o 
schools located in different sections of the state, we hav 
presented the data for the northern, central, and souther: 
sections separately. 
The 136 rural high schools contained 1194 seniors. Fo 
this comparison enough city high schools were selected a 
random from different. sections of the state to make a 
equal numbe¥ of seniors, care being taken to distributel 
them about equally through different sections of the state. 
There were a few more rural high schools in the central and 
\ northern than in the southern section. 
\\ Amere glance at the table will show: (1) that the rural 
high schools, if taken as a whole, rate decidedly lower in 
every section of the state ; (2) that the seniors in both types 
of schools rate higher for the northern than for the southern 
section; (3) that the central section stands about midway 
between the northern and southern sections; (4) that the 
rating for the rural schools in the central section is slightly 
higher thar! for the rural schools located in the northern 
section.

| Combining the above results from different sections of 
he state, we find that the rural schools have a larger per- 
centage of seniors making the most superior, (A+) grade 
f intelligence, while the city schools have proportionally 
more seniors making a high average or C+ intelligence 
rating.) This is clearly shown in Figure 68, which indi- 
ates the percentage of seniors representing each type 
of community who possess each grade of intelligence 
(At to F).

larger percentage of seniors possessing the lower grades of

the rural schools contain a few more seniors who are very

  2. The rather suprising and contrasting fact that the 
were, nevertheless, proportionally more seniors represe 
ing the agricultural districts who were rated A+ or A th 
were found in either of the other groups. The percenta, 
of individuals in these schools who possess these highe} 
grades of intelligence was even greater than for the gro 
of city schools which made the best all-round showing 
the test. (Compare also Figure 71.)

Curves were also drawn (see Figure 71) which show t

These curves indicate in another way the relative standii 
of these community groups. It will be seen that t 
curve for the manufacturing group passes above both t! 
other curves at every percentile level save the 95 and 
percentile points, where the curve for the rural schoo} 
rises above it. 
The outstanding feature of these curves is the fact th: 
the curve for the rural schools drops so far below bo 
other curves at the lower percentile levels and rises abo 
them at the 95 and 99 percentile points. This shows aga’ 
that while our rural high schools have a greater proporti 
of seniors with inferior ability than are found in either 
the other types of community, they nevertheless have 
greater per cent of seniors possessing the most superi 
grades of intelligence. The same fact was brought out 
Figure 69, which shows that while the rural high schoo

  The results of this comparison are interesting not merely 
cause of the marked differences which they show in 
vor of the schools located in the better economic sections 
the state but because we find a larger percentage of the 
udents in the poorer economic districts possessing very 
perior mental ability than are found in the schools of 
e better economic sections of the state. This is true, 
lotwithstanding the fact that the general level of ability 
these county schools supported by the state is very low, 
d the further fact that the percentage of seniors possess- 
ig very inferior grades of mental ability is unusually high 
all these regions. The median score for the state-aided 
unties, taken as a whole, is 5 points lower and the number 
ff students who made scores above the state median is 
1 per cent less than for the schools located in the better 
gricultural sections. Notwithstanding these facts, there 
re proportionally more seniors in the high schools of these 
legions who possess the highest grade of ability found 
mong the high school seniors of the entire state. 
6. Intelligence of seniors coming from schools of the 
ame size or rank. Of more practical significance, how- 
ver, than these community and sectional differences 
re the startling inequalities existing between the senior 
lasses from individual schools, even when these schools 
ure of the same size or rank and when located in the 
same county or city. 
As stated in the opening paragraph of this chapter, 
[Indiana educators have proceeded on the theory that high 
schools of every rank and location should measure up to 
the same standard of efficiency and achievement, regard-  
-P-A-G-E-262
    244 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
less of the character of the pupil material with which the! 
have to work. Our colleges and universities accept st 
dents without question or examination from all the 
schools if they have been commissioned. The sta‘ 
board of education commissions these schools upo 
the recommendation of the state high school inspecto: 
who up to the present time has had no reliable method 
evaluating the results which should be obtained in a pa 
ticular high school. He has had to rely on the old an 
unreliable method of expecting equal results from all the 
schools, provided only that they are equal in materi 
equipment and in the skill and training of their teacher: 
What is, perhaps, still more unreasonable and inefficien 
is that superintendents and teachers have been endeavor 
ing to obtain similar results in all these schools by measurin, 
the accomplishment of the school or the results of teachin, 
by means of achievement tests. The following figure: 
and data showing the marked inequalities in the nativ 
mental endowment of the pupils actually found in th 
various high schools of the state, will indicate how in: 
efficient and unreasonable such practices are. To be trul 
efficient and just in our educational work we must adapt th 
work of our schools to the mental abilities and needs of ow 
pupils, by applying in our educational practice the principl 
set forth by the great Teacher in his parable of the talents. 
To ascertain the differences in mental capacity of th 
seniors representing different individual schools, we com: 
pared their test scores by the same methods used in othe 
chapters of this report. The more important results o: 
these comparisons are presented below.

-P-A-G-E-264
246 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  equally diverse and great would appear if we had take 
the last or middle 26 schools belonging to this rank 
or if we had selected schools from any other rank, with on 
or two exceptions. The larger high schools of the stati 
not only had proportionally fewer students rated At or 
on the tests than were found in the rural and smaller hig! 
schools, but they graduate fewer students possessing ver 
inferior grades of ability. For this reason the variation 
in mental test score for the seniors belonging to th 
schools ranked 1 and 2 do not extend quite so far abow 
and below the state median as is the case for the school 
represented in Figures 72 and 73. The differences in th 
native mental endowment of the seniors representing th 
high schools ranked 4, 5, 7, and 8 are as varied and grea‘ 
as the differences shown in Figures 72 and 73, and it should 
be added that inequalities in native mental endowment} 
equally great would appear if schools of equal rank from| 
the same section of the state or from the same community] 
had been compared. (See section 7 below.) 
To give some indication of the variations in mental 
ability found among these same schools, we present in 
Tables LI and LII the median scores for each of the schools 
represented in Figures 72 and 73. These tables also show 
the per cent of seniors making scores above the state 
median. The proportion of seniors in each of these schools 
possessing average, that is to say, C+, C, or C-, intelligence 
may be obtained for any individual school by adding the 
per cent rated A or B and D, E£, or F, and subtracting 
it from 100.

other individual schools selected at random from our enti 
list and for schools belonging to the same rank. The 
comparisons revealed the following facts with regard 
the distribution of different grades of intelligence in parti 
ular schools : 
1. In some schools all members of the senior class posse: 
a superior or very high grade of intelligence. That is 
say, all members of the class will be rated A or B, or A, 
and Ct. 
2. In other schools all members of the senior class ra: 
very low, none scoring above the median for the state. 
a few schools the entire senior class would make scor 
which entitled them to only a D, E, or F intelligence ratin, 
3. Instill other schools a large proportion of all the seni 
class may possess a C, or average grade of mental abilit; 
4. Ina fourth type of school there is marked irregulari 
among the members of the senior class. Some individu 
possess very superior mental ability. Other members 
the same class will merit a ranking of E- or F. Th 
situation is much more likely to be found in the small 
high schools. The larger high schools are better grad 
and seem to have eliminated all inferior students befo 
they reach the senior year.? 
5. In some schools of the latter type the various grad 
of intelligence will be found normally distributed. 
6. Many schools in all sections of the state and of a) 
ranks occupy various positions between these extremes. 
1There is some evidence in our data that they may have also elim 
nated those with the most superior grade of intelligence. No individual 
scoring in the highest one percentile group were found in tke larger hig 
schools of the state.

from rank 6 and arranged to show these variations 
intelligence in individual schools. 
9. Geographical distribution of the most intellige 
high school seniors found in the state. As stated 
the introductory chapter of this report, our prima 
purpose in making this investigation was to loca 
by means of reliable intelligence tests the most capab 
boys and girls graduating from the high schools of t! 
state, in order that they might be encouraged and, if nee 
be, helped financially to continue their education in co 
lege. For this purpose we have considered those whos 
mental: test scores place them in the highest 1 and 
percentile groups for the entire state as such superior i 
dividuals. 
It must, however, not be assumed that group intelligen 
tests can be used as an instrument for making detaile 
individual diagnoses. Such tests are most useful for th 
separation of large groups of individuals into section: 
representing various grades of mental ability. They ar 
most reliable for differentiating the bright or very brigh 
members of such groups from those with lower grades o 
intelligence. 
When an individual diagnosis is desired, the results o! 
a group intelligence test should be supplemented with 
teachers’ estimates of native mental ability, school success, 
and, better still, with the results of an individual mental 
examination which naturally can be made more refined, 
inclusive, and exact. For various reasons a particulat 
individual may not do himself justice on a group intelli- 
gence test and so may make a, score indicating a grade of 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES 259 
  telligence far below that which he actually possesses. 
ut when an individual makes a rating on a reliable group 
telligence scale which places him in the highest 1 or 2 
ercentile group for an entire state, we have evidence which 
ows fairly conclusively that he possesses a very superior 
ade of intelligence. 
It was our purpose to locate these highly gifted individ- 
als, so that their special capacities and talents might be 
onserved by giving them the special training and guidance 
hich their superior mental ability warrants. 
Individuals possessing this superior grade of intelligence 
ere found in every section of the state; in every type of 
igh school from the smallest, ranked 8, to the largest, 
here the graduating class numbered several hundred. But 
lhey were not found in equal proportions or in the senior 
lasses of every school. These superior individuals come 
om every section and every type of community in the 
tate, —rural, manufacturing, and urban; they represent 
very occupational class and all economic strata except 
he wealthiest group, which had no representatives in this 
ost superior class; they come from the smallest and 
ost poorly equipped high schools; they were often re- 
arded by the school and in general only regularly promoted. 
o special provision seems to have been made by any of 
he high schools to locate them or to administer to them in 
ccordance with their intellectual capacities and special 
eeds. In fact there is considerable evidence in our data 
hat their special abilities are often smothered or wasted 
ecause the work of the school has not been adapted to 
heir mental strength nor results demanded in proportion.

be summarized 
under the follow- 
ing heads: (a) community and sectional differences; (b)

     ies in mental strength of the senior classes representing 
ifferent sections and types of community may be briefly 
tated as follows : 
1. The seniors from the schools in the northern section 
f the state made a better showing on the tests than did 
hose from the central. Those from the central section 
anked higher than ‘did those from the southern. This is 
rue whether the schools are considered as a whole or. by 
anks and the superiority holds whether we compare them 
n the basis of central tendency or on the basis of the per- 
ntage who possess the highest and lowest grades of mental 
bility found among high school seniors. Considering the 
egions as a whole, the northern section of the state is su- 
erior to the central and the central to the southern. 
2. The seniors from the urban centers of the state and 
rom the smaller city high schools ranked higher on the 
ests than did the seniors from rural high schools. The 
verage level of intelligence of the group was higher for 
city schools and the frequency curves show that the city 
schools contain a larger percentage of seniors possessing the 
higher intelligence grades and a smaller percentage possess- 
ing the lowest. But there are proportionately more 
seniors in the rural high schools who possess the highest 
grade of intelligence found among the seniors of the entire 
state. These results suggest that while the better stock 
of the state is congregating in the cities and is engaging in 
manufacturing, business, and professional pursuits rather 
than in agricultural, more individuals with exceptionally 
good mental ability are found in the country. 
3. Comparing the intelligence of the seniors coming  
-P-A-G-E-280
  262 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
    
      
     
    
       
     
   from the purely manufacturing, agricultural, and minin; 
communities of the state, we find the manufacturing di: 
tricts superior to the agricultural, and the agricultur 
superior to the mining. This holds whether we compar 
the seniors from these communities on the basis of genera 
level of intelligence or on the basis of the range of intelli; 
gence for each group, or the various grades of mental ability 
found within the group. There are proportionately mor 
seniors in the manufacturing communities rated A or B thai 
in the agricultural and mining communities, and a smalle 
percentage possessing the lowest grades of intelligence. 
But the agricultural communities have more than twice a: 
large a percentage of seniors who rank in the highest 1 per: 
centile class. The mining communities have no represent 
atives in this class and only half as many rated A or Basar 
found in the agricultural and manufacturing communities, 
4. When we compare the schools in the best and wors' 
economic districts of the state, we find a proportionatel; 
larger number who possess the higher grades of intelli- 
gence coming from the schools in the richer counties than 
are found in the poorer economic districts. That is, the 
seniors in the schools of the former districts rank higher in 
median score and have a larger percentage of individuals 
rated A or B on the tests. But the schools in the poorer 
districts have a decidedly larger proportion of seniors 
possessing the highest grade of intelligence. Propor- 
tionately twice as many students from these poorer 
districts belong in the highest one percentile group 
as were found among the seniors coming from the wealthier 
counties. But the proportion of seniors with superior and
-P-A-G-E-281
  SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES 263 
igh average intelligence is much less and the percentage 
ossessing the lowest grades of intelligence is relatively 
igh in the less productive communities of the state. 
(b) Differences between individual schools. Com- 
aring the mental strength of the senior classes in schools 
f different sizes or ranks and in individual schools of the 
same size or rank, but located in the same county or city 
lor in different sections of the state, we found the following 
marked differences between them. 
1. The senior classes from schools of moderate size 
(ranked 2, 3, and 4) possess, on the whole, the ablest 
seniors. Taken asa group they notonly rank higher on the 
mental tests than the representatives of any other groups, 
but contain a larger percentage of seniors possessing the 
highest grades of intelligence, and the smallest percentage 
of seniors possessing the lowest grades of intelligence found 
in the total group. Notwithstanding this fact, all ranks or 
types of high schools have representatives in this high- 
est intelligence group regardless of their geographic and 
economic situation. The smaller high schools have the 
largest percentage of seniors possessing the lowest grades 
of intelligence found among our standard group. Their 
senior classes also show the widest ranges of intelligence. 
But they rank very high in the percentage of seniors who 
make the highest intelligence grade. The range of in- 
telligence in the largest high schools is relatively small, 
suggesting that both the brightest and dullest seniors 
have been eliminated before the senior year.! 
1 One would at first thought be inclined to explain this result on the 
hypothesis that the tests were not so carefully given or that the results

    264 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
2. The most striking and significant results revealed b 
the comparisons made between the intelligence ratings o' 
seniors coming from different communities and schools wa: 
the marked inequalities in mental capacity which wer 
shown between the senior classes from schools of the sam 
rank even when located in the same community or city. 
Considering the schools of any rank as a class or group, we 
found individual schools in this group where all members 
of its senior class made scores on the mental tests which| 
entitled them to an A or B intelligence ranking. Other 
schools of the same rank had no senior making an intelli- 
gence grade higher than C~ and occasionally a school 
where all seniors made an intelligence rating of D, E, or F. 
Other schools ranked at various levels in between these 
extremes and the inequalities hold whether we compare the 
schools on the basis of median score or on the basis of 
the per cent making the highest or lowest grades of in- 
telligence. For example, among the first 26 schools of 
rank 6, arranged alphabetically, we find one school where 
100 per cent of its seniors scored above the state median 
and another school where all its senior class scored below 
the state median. The median score for the first school 
were inaccurately scored in the smaller schools. But this is impossible 
because all the test papers from these schools were rescored in the labor- 
atory. The fact that so many pupils made such low records in these 
schools rather seems to indicate that instructions were followed in these 
schools as well as in the larger schools. In fact this point was tested by 
comparing the scores on the odd and even tests. This was done for a 
group of these smaller schools and showed the usual correlation, demon- 
strating that the tests had been consistently and carefully given. This. 
method also gave us a check on the general reliability of all our results 
and proved to our satisfaction that the tests were carefully and uni- 
formly given.
-P-A-G-E-283
  SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES 265 
   as 161; for the second 108. In rank 3 we find a 
variation almost as great. In school E, 91 per cent of the 
senior class made scores above the state median with a 
median score of 157. School G had only 18 per cent 
scoring above the state median with a median score of 116. 
Ranks 4, 5, 7, and 8 show variations equally great. But 
such marked differences were not found among the larger 
schools or among the schools showing a wide range of in- 
telligence grades. 
3. Inequalities equally striking appear if we compare 
individual schools located in the same city. Im city A 
(compare Table LIII and Figure 76) the median score 
for one of its high schools was 152; for the other 134. 
In the former, 69 per cent of the senior class scored above 
the state median; in the latter, only 5 percent. IncityC, 
high school number 1 had 78 per cent of its seniors scoring 
above the state median ; its median score was 155. School 
number 2 had no seniors scoring above the state median 
and the median score was only 100 points. City B had 
three high schools; numbers 2 and 3 are almost identical 
if we compare the mental strength of their senior classes, 
The median score for each was 146. The per cent scoring 
above the state median was 54 and 53. But school num- 
ber 1 in this same city had 67 per cent of its seniors 
scoring above the state median with a median score for 
the class of 157. School number 2 had the highest per- 
centage of seniors making the highest intelligence rating 
(A). (Compare Table LIII above.) 
1 School number 2 in city C wasa colored high school. The otherschools 
used in these comparisons are not only all white high schools, but all 
belong to the same rank.
-P-A-G-E-284
  266 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
4, Inequalities equally striking appear if we compar 
the mental capacity of the senior classes in individual 
schools located in the same county. (See Table LIV an 
Figure 78 above.) 
5. The more important facts pertaining to the grades of 
intelligence possessed by the senior classes in the different 
high schools and the range in mental ability which they 
show have been concisely stated in section 8 above. It} 
needs only to be added that there are marked and signifi- 
cant differences in these respects. Some senior classes are 
uniformly bright; others are uniformly dull. Some 
classes are very uneven, showing a wide range in mental 
ability. Most schools occupy positions between these 
extremes. 
(c) Discussion. The practical significance of these 
marked differences between sections, communities, and 
individual schools needs only to be pointed out to be ap- 
preciated. The inequalities in mental capacity of classes, 
schools, or pupils in different buildings of the same school 
system, or schools located in different sections and com- 
munities of a state, should be taken into account in evaluat- 
ing the scholastic accomplishment of any class or school. 
No teacher’s work should be judged except in relation to 
the native mental capacity of the raw material with which 
she must deal. 
The exact amounts of the differences shown in this 
chapter should not be emphasized, as our method for 
obtaining them was somewhat crude. Some allowance 
should also be made, perhaps, for the fact that the tests 
were given by so many different individuals. But that
-P-A-G-E-285
  SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY DIFFERENCES 267 
ur results demonstrate the existence of such class, com- 
unity, sectional, and school differences cannot be denied. 
uch inaccuracies as may be found in the results presented 
this chapter might easily be avoided by any city or 
unty superintendent wishing to make a mental survey 
f all his schools, merely by having one person give all the 
ests and by exercising special care to secure uniform pro- 
edure. 
Such class and community differences as we have de- 
cribed should also be taken into account in evaluating 
lhe product of these high schools for admission to college. 
ur results show that the most superior individuals may 
e picked up in the smallest and most poorly equipped 
igh schools of the state, and that there are great variations 
the native mental endowment of the seniors graduating 
rom the same school. A college might also well look to 
ertain sections of the state for its chief supply of students. 
(loreover, if the colleges are to obtain and train the ablest 
eniors in the state, they must invent some method of selec- 
ion better than that of judging them by their past scholas- 
icattainment. As was shown in Chapter IV the best men- 
ally endowed young people in the state may not even ap- 
ly for admission to college. They may not even be 
raduating from high school. Furthermore, mere scholas- 
ic attainment is no guarantee of superior mental ability. 
t may be attained in normal time by an individual of only 
verage ability or less, while the genius, because the work 
f the high school is ill-adapted to his mental capacities 
r intellectual needs, will often make only an average 
showing in his high school work, sometimes not even that.
-P-A-G-E-286

The importance of the mental survey as a means fo 
locating the best mentally endowed pupils in our school 
and as an aid for conserving their special abilities to th 
state is beginning to be recognized. It provides a practi 
cal and reliable method for their selection which constitute 
the first necessary step in the process of educating them i 
accordance with their mental ability and needs. It ma 
also be used as a means for directing them towards th 
work in life which they should undertake. It may, there 
fore, be used in the solution of some of the most perplexin; 
social and educational problems which confront the worl 
to-day and so become one of the means for conserving an 
cultivating the full capacities and talents of all the peopl 
of the state.

CHAPTER XIII 
INTELLIGENCE OF SENIOR BOYS AND GIRLS 
COMPARED 
Ir the mental capacities and special abilities of high 
hool seniors are to be fully conserved by wiser educational 
d vocational guidance, and by the adaptation of edu- 
tional opportunities to individual needs, the question of 
x differences takes on new and special significance. As 
ated in the introductory chapter, the intelligence scores 
ade by the boys and girls were kept separate in all our 
mparisons, in order that a study might be made of all 
x differences revealed throughout the investigation. 
Many of the important sex differences shown by our 
mparison of the various senior groups have already been 
esented in previous chapters. These results will, there- 
re, be only briefly summarized here, and presented, with 
her pertinent facts bearing on the following problems : 
) differences in native mental endowment; (2) differ- 
ces in college intention ; (3) differences in school success ; 
) differences in vocational interest; (5) differences in 
holastic interest ; (6) differences between the boys and 
irls representing different economic and occupational 
roups; and (7) differences between the intelligence of 
enior boys and girls coming from different communities 
nd schools.

1. Differences in native mental endowment. Of tl 
5748 seniors used in the various comparisons made i 
this investigation, 60 per cent (59.9 per cent) were gir 
and 40 per cent (40.1 per cent) boys. This gave us a thi 
more girls than boys for our comparative study of the sexe 
It is therefore evident that more girls than boys are gra 
uating from the high schools of the state and that t 
differences in mental ability found cannot be taken 
typical of actual differences in the mental capacity of t! 
sexes. The sex differences in general intelligence sho 
in this study are, however, important. 
It should be stated at the outset that in every compari 
son of the intelligence scores made throughout the enti 
study, the record made by the boys was superior to th 
made by the girls. The amount of this difference may b 
computed from the median scores for each group, and fro 
the record made by the middle 50 per cent of individual] 
belonging to each sex. The median score for the boy] 
was 138.9 points; for the girls 135.8. The range in scor 
for the middle 50 per cent was 126 to 150 points for th 
boys, and 123 to 147 for the girls. The boys were al: 
superior at every intelligence level, as is shown by th 
different percentile scores given below.

‘Other differences in the mental ability of the sexes are 
own by the per cent belonging to each sex who made 
res above the state median, viz. 53.74 per cent for the 
ys and 47.48 per cent for the girls. The best indication 
the comparative mental strength of the sexes is the per 
nt of boys making scores above the median score for the 
rls. This was 56.2 per cent, while only 41.4 per cent of 
e girls made scores above the median score for the boys. 
we make a similar comparison for other proportionate 
oups of boys and girls, we find that the superiority of the 
loys holds for all regions of the distribution. This is seen 
yy the data contained in the following percentile table, 
owing the per cent of boys and girls who scored above 
nd below various percentile groups of the opposite sex.

lowest grades of intelligence. That is to say, a larg| 
percentage of boys than girls make these higher ratings 
the intelligence tests, and a smaller percentage of bo: 
make the lower ratings obtained by our total or standa

A more significant question, however, is the range

      intelligence rating of D, E, or F, as opposed to 28.4 per 
nt for the girls. 
Carrying these comparisons still farther to the groups 
ted A or At we find that the higher in the scale of in- 
lligence we go the greater is the percentage of boys. 
lhere were proportionately twice as many boys as girls 
lho made intelligence scores above 180. There were also 
ore girls than boys making an intelligence grade of D or 
, but the percentage of boysmaking the lowest intelligence 
ade made by high school seniors (F) was slightly higher 
r the boys than for the girls—1.34 and 1.16. But the 
nge of intelligence extends lower in the scale for the girls 
an for the boys. {The duller girls seem better able to 
rvive in high school than the boys and to succeed with 
eir work where boys with equal mental ability fail. 
2. Differences in college intention. Of our total group 
ff seniors, 74 per cent of the boys and 63 per cent of the 
irls were planning to go to college. Most of the boys 
oing to college (56 per cent) had definitely selected the 
llege they expected to attend. Of these 87 per cent 
hose a technical or professional school, while 19 per cent 
elected a college of liberal arts; 44 per cent had not 
cided what college to attend. Among the girls going 
college 29 per cent selected a college of liberal arts; 3 per 
ent selected a professional or technical college, but 
8 per cent had not selected the college they would 
ttend. 
The general superiority of the boys over the girls is 
shown by the fact that no matter what groups we compare — 
those going to college, those not going, those going to

that all the facts about the intelligence of seniors going

namely: The brightest seniors are going to colleges of 
liberal arts. Those going to college rank, in intelligence, 
slightly above those not expecting to attend. But 22

not even planning to continue their education beyon 
the high school. Yet 65 per vent of the boys and girl 
possessing the lowest grades of intelligence found amon 
high school seniors are going to college in ever increasin, 
numbers. (Compare Chapter IV.) 
3. Differences in school success. The most interestin, 
and significant sex differences revealed by the survey ar 
shown by a comparison of the intelligence scores an 
standing in their school work. The scholastic recor 
which each senior had made in his high school work i 
shown in two ways: 
(a) By the average school marks obtained in the variou: 
subjects studied in high school. | 
(b) By the way each senior was advanced during hi 
high school and elementary school course. This is show: 
by the number of times he was accelerated, regularly pro- 
moted, or retarded during his school career. 
(a) Scholastic rating of the sexes compared. Our com-| 
parative study of the school marks made by the boys and 
girls shows that the girls were consistently rated higher 
in their high school work than the boys, notwithstand-' 
ing the fact that the boys belonging to every scholastic 
group make higher scores on the intelligence tests. Table 
LVI giving the per cent of boys and girls who obtained 
various scholastic ratings compares the sexes on this 
point, and shows that a larger percentage of girls than 
boys were rated excellent and high on their high school 
work, and a smaller percentage were rated medium 
and fair. |

The same fact was emphasized by our frequency table 
and curves prepared for the boys and girls belonging to th 
various scholastic groups. The curves for the boys b 
longing to each scholastic group pass consistently abov 
the curves for the girls at all points indicating the highe 
grades of intelligence (A, B, and C+) and fall below thei 
at all points indicating the lower grades. 
(b) Acceleration and retardation. If we measure th 
school success of our total group of senior boys and girl 
by the number of times they were accelerated, retarded, o 
regularly promoted during their school career, we fin 
that more girls than boys have been accelerated and fewei 
retarded in both the high school and elementary school 
About the same percentage of boys and girls were regularly 
promoted. (Compare Tables IV and VI in Chapter V! 
page 49.) Yet the boys made higher scores on the intelli 
gence tests than did the girls belonging to similar groups 
This was true regardless of where the acceleration o 
retardation took place, and regardless of the amount o’ 
acceleration or retardation that occurred. 
The fact that the boys make consistently higher rating: 
on the intelligence tests is clearly shown by the media: 
scores for the several semester- and age-groups give! 
in Table LVIII on following page. 
The same fact was brought out when the records made 
by the middle 50 per cent of boys and girls belonging to 
each of these semester- and age-groups were compared. 
(See Figures 18 and 19, Chapter V.) These showed the per 
cent of boys and girls belonging to each of these groups 
rated A or B and D, E,or F. (See Figures 20 and 21,

hapter V.) The frequency curves for the various accel- 
rated and retarded groups indicated the same thing. The 
urves for the boys who were accelerated and retarded rise 
egularly above the curves for the girls at all points indicat- 
ng the higher grades of intelligence and drop below them 
t the points indicating the lowest grades of intelligence. 
Compare Figures 22 and 23, Chapter V.) The follow- 
Ing conclusions may be drawn from this study of sex dif- 
erences in school success : 
(1) The senior boys who took the intelligence tests are 
righter than the girls, but the girls are nevertheless given 
igher school marks and are more rapidly and regularly 
promoted by the school. 
(2) Of the boys accelerated in high school, twice asmany 
nade an intelligence rating of A or B as did the girls sim- 
larly accelerated. Many girls with inferior intelligence 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  280 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
ratings have been accelerated in high school. Of the girl 
graduating from high school in three years about 12 pe 
cent make an intelligence rating of D, E, or F onthe ment: 
tests. Among the boys completing their high scho 
course in the same time only about 4 per cent fall so low o: 
the mental tests. 
(3) The boys retarded by the high school are muc! 
brighter than the girls who fail of promotion. Of the boy: 
requiring ten or more semesters to graduate, 21 per cen 
made an intelligence rating of A or B. No retarded girl: 
made so high an intelligence rating on the tests. If 
girl is retarded in high school, we may assume on the basi 
of our test results that she probably possesses inferio’ 
intelligence. In fact, 58 per cent of the girls retarded i 
high school make the lowest grades of intelligence. Bu 
many girls with inferior ability have been accelerated b 
the high schools of the state. 
These facts seem to show either that the girls who hav 
the ability to succeed with their school work are mor 
likely to apply themselves than is the case for the boys, o: 
that the course of study and work of the high school som: 
how favors the girls. 
4. Sex differences in vocational interest. A few mor 
they had chosen their vocation in life. The largest per. 
centage of boys chose engineering (31 per cent), farmin, 
(25 per cent), a skilled trade (13 per cent), business (1 
per cent), teaching (5 per cent), law (5 per cent), medi: 
cine (4 per cent). The largest percentage of girls se- 
lected teaching (47 per cent), clerical work (34 per cent),
-P-A-G-E-299
  SEX DIFFERENCES 281 
usic and art (7 per cent), and nursing (5 per cent). Only 
ixteen different lines of work were chosen by both sexes, 
ourteen by each sex. 
Comparing the intelligence scores made by the group of 
oys who selected a vocation in life with the scores made 
y the group who had not, we find that the former group 
is only a little superior in intelligence to the latter. But 
he boys belonging to both groups make a better record on 
he mental tests than the girls belonging to the same groups. 
here is, however, a marked difference in the intelligence 
f the boys and girls choosing different occupations. 
The boys choosing science, the ministry, and journalism, 
if taken as a group, rank highest on the intelligence tests. 
Those selecting medicine, business, and farming rank low- 
lest. Those electing law, engineering, and teaching rank 
in between these other groups. The girls selecting journal- 
ism, social service, and law, taken as a group, rank above all 
others. The girls selecting clerical work and nursing 
rank lowest on the intelligence tests. The groups electing 
teaching and medicine rank in between these other groups. 
The relative positions of all these occupational groups re- 
main the same whether they are compared on the basis of 
central tendency or percentage belonging to the group who 
possess the highest and lowest grades of intelligence. 
The brightest senior boys chose science and engineer- 
ing, the dullest boys chose farming. Those selecting 
certain professions, notably medicine, possess only average 
mental ability for high school seniors and were on a par 
mentally with the group selecting a skilled trade. 
One of the characteristic features of these occupational
-P-A-G-E-300
     | 
282 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
groups is the wide range in intelligence shown by the i 
dividuals choosing the same line of work. A certain o 
cupational group, taken as a whole, might average very lo’ 
yet individual seniors would select that occupation whi 
possessed the highest grades of intelligence. This is tru 
for both the girls and boys. Occupational choice seems t 
take place quite irrespective of a knowledge of the mental 
capacity or strength that is required to succeed in the o: 
cupation selected. For example, some of the brightes' 
senior girls in the state select stenography. The genera 
level of intelligence of the girls selecting this occupation i 
the lowest of all occupational groups. The dullest senio: 
girls in the state chose teaching as their life occupation. 
and similar inequalities were found among the boys select: 
ing the same occupation. In some of these occupation: 
there is opportunity for the exercise of exceptional menta 
qualities. Other occupations chosen by the brightes' 
seniors clearly require only an average or an inferior grad 
of mental ability to succeed. Such occupations are never. 
theless indiscriminately chosen by the brightest boys an 
girls. The dullest seniors in the state are, on the other 
hand, selecting such occupations as teaching, nursing, 
and medicine in large numbers, occupations which clearly| 
demand the exercise of the best mental powers to be 
found among the young people of the entire state. 
5. Sex differences in scholastic interest. The scholas- 
tic interests of the sexes may be inferred in part 
from the high school courses which the boys and girls 
elect, but chiefly from the favorite high school subjects 
chosen by each sex. The percentage of boys and girls
-P-A-G-E-301

   ho were completing each type of high school course is 
follows:

The boys graduating from each of these courses rank 
igher on the intelligence tests than do the girls. This 
olds true whether the sexes are compared on the basis of 
ntral tendency or on the basis of the percentage belong- 
g to the group who possess the higher and lower grades 
if mental ability. The percentage of boys and girls be- 
mging to each course-group who made an A or B intelli- 
ence grade on the test is as follows:

It should also be pointed out that a larger percentage of 
lhe girls belonging to each of these course-groups are rated 
, E, or F. The scientific, college preparatory, and 
cademic courses send the largest percentage of boys to
-P-A-G-E-302
284 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  college; the classical, scientific, and general course sen 
the greatest percentage of girls to college. 
A mere glance at Table LIX will show that a larger per 
centage of girls than boys selected a commercial, voc 
tional, and classical course in high school,while proportion] 
ately more boys than girls selected the academic an 
scientific courses. 
Of more significance, however, is the percentage of boy 
and girls who choose particular subjects as their favorit 
study in high school. The favorite studies of the boy 
named in order of preference, are science (30 per cent) 
mathematics (28 per cent), and history (15 per cent). Th 
favorite studies of the girls are English (29 per cent) 
mathematics (17 per cent), commercial subjects (13 pe 
cent), foreign language and history (each 11 per cent) 
The complete scholastic preferences for both sexes ar 
shown in Table LX.

  SEX DIFFERENCES 285 
Comparing the intelligence ratings of the boys and girls 
eferring various high school studies, we find that the boys 
eferring science and mathematics rank above all other 
coups. Those selecting vocational subjects rank lowest. 
‘he girls ranking highest on the tests select Latin and for- 
gn language. The girls selecting vocational and com- 
ercial subjects rank lowest on the tests. This holds true 
hether these groups are compared on the basis of central 
ndency or on the basis of the percentage belonging to 
e group who possess the highest and lowest grades of 
telligence. (Compare Figures 46, 47, and 48, and Tables 
XXII and XXXIII in Chapter IX.) 
The brightest seniors in the entire state (all boys) 
lect mathematics and science as their favorite study in 
igh school. The brightest girls select foreign language. 
There is also a marked difference between the mental 
rength of the boys and girls selecting the same subject. 
‘he boys selecting mathematics, chemistry, commercial 
ibjects, and general science are far superior in mental 
pacity to the girls selecting these same subjects; while 
e girls selecting foreign language and Latin are far su- 
erior in intelligence to the boys choosing them. The boys 
nd girls selecting history, English, and the various vo- 
ational subjects are about equal in mental strength. 
The fact that the brightest seniors in the state are boys; 
at these brightest boys select mathematics and science 
is their favorite study in high school; that the largest 
ercentage of boys select mathematics and science as 
eir favorite study while the largest percentage of girls 
elect English; that proportionately five times as many
-P-A-G-E-304
    286 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
girls as boys select foreign language —these facts 
point in the direction of a genuine sex difference in t! 
mental characteristics possessed by the boys and the gi 
and suggest that some radical readjustments are need 
in the high school work. 
6. Differences between the boys and girls represe: 
ing various occupations and economic classes. (a) Oc 
pational groups. Comparing the records made on t 
mental tests by the boys and girls belonging to the v: 
ous occupational groups, we find that each occupation| 
class has about the same proportion of boys and gi 
in the high school, with the exception of the skilled artisa 
day laborer, and business executive classes. (See Tab 
LXI.) The skilled artisan and day laborer groups have 
larger percentage of girls than boys; the business exec 
tive class a larger percentage of boys.

rls belonging to the same occupational classes. The su- 
riority of the boys representing the other occupational 
lasses is about normal. It should be added that these 
fferences remain constant whether the groups are com- 
red on the basis of central tendency or on the basis of 
e percentage belonging to the group who possess the 
ighest grades of intelligence. The percentage of boys 
d girls belonging to the various occupational classes who 
tained the highest intelligence rating (A or B) on the 
sts is as follows:

The same fact is brought out in Figure 51, Chapter X, 
hich shows the score made by the middle 50 per cent of 
oys and girls belonging to each occupational group. Com- 
are also Figures 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, and 59 in Chapter X. 
‘hese show that the boys representing the skilled artisan 
nd day laborer classes rank farther above the girls be- 
longing to these groups than do the boys representing the 
ther occupational groups. 
(b) Economic groups compared. Comparing the num- 
er of boys and girls coming from the various economic 
lasses, we find that a larger percentage of boys than girls . 
me from homes of wealthy parentage and proportion- 
tely more girls come from homes where the annual in-
-P-A-G-E-306
    288 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
come is low. The percentage of our total group of seni 
boys and girls who represent each economic class is as fo 
lows:

The boys belonging to each of these economic grow 
rank higher on the intelligence tests than do the girls, 
may be seen from a comparison of Figures 60 and 62 i 
Chapter XI. It will be noticed also that the boys repr 
senting the higher income groups rank decidedly high 
on the intelligence tests than do the girls belonging to th| 
same economic group, notwithstanding the fact that thes| 
wealthiest economic groups send a relatively larger pe 
centage of boys to high school than any of the other group: 
We might expect the boys from the lowest economic group| 
to make a better showing on the mental tests than th 
girls because this group has a larger percentage of girl| 
than boys in our graduating classes. But the highe| 
economic groups have proportionately more boys than gir] 
who nevertheless make scores on the intelligence tests fa 
superior to those made by the girls. Taken asa group th 
boys from these wealthiest classes rank above the girl: 
in median score, in the record made by the middle 50 pei 
cent, and in the percentage of individuals belonging t
-P-A-G-E-307
  SEX DIFFERENCES 289 
e group who possess the highest grades of intelli- 
nce. 
7. Sex differences shown by our comparison of dif- 
rent communities and individual schools. The com- 
unity and sectional comparisons revealed no new facts. 
each the boys maintain the superiority shown through- 
ut. the study. Comparisons between the sexes in dif- 
rent schools revealed the following conditions : 
In some schools the boys surpass the girls by a wide 
argin. In other schools the girls all surpass the boys. 
Mm some cases these differences are very marked. In 
me schools the mental ability of the boys and girls is 
bout equal. In other cases the range between the best 
nd worst is very great. In many schools the distribu- 
ion of mental ability for one or both sexes follows the nor- 
al distribution curve. In some schools the inequalities 
in mental strength of the members of the senior class are 
Imost as great as those found among the members of our 
tal or standard group. In other schools the range in 
ental ability is quite narrow. 
When we consider that this is the rule even in the 
maller schools the practical significance of these group dif- 
‘erences for superintendents and teachers becomes evident. 
8. Discussion. Four facts stand out most prominently 
n the above comparisons of the records made on the intel- 
igence tests by our total group of senior boys and girls. 
1) The marked and persistent superiority shown by the 
joys in all these comparisons. (2) The poor scholastic rec- 
ord made by this superior group of boys. (8) Certain sex 
differences in special mental ability suggested by the vo-
-P-A-G-E-308
  290 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
cational and scholastic preferences of the sexes. (4) T! 
apparent mental inequality of the boys and girls represe 
ing various occupational and economic classes. 
Since there were a third more girls than boys in t 
senior classes tested, we cannot conclude that the sex diffe 
ences shown by this select group show typical sex diff 
ences in mental ability. The most probable explanati 
that can be offered for the marked superiority of the boy, 
taken as a group, is that many boys of the more inferi 
ability dropped out of school before reaching senior stan 
ing in high school, while more girls with inferior intelligen 
remained to complete their high school course. This 
made all the more plausible because of the fact that the gir! 
secure higher academic marks than the boys and show i 
other ways that they succeed better with their high scho 
work. This might tend to drive the duller boys out 
school while it would permit many girls with mediocre abi 
ity to remain until they completed the high school course. 
But this explanation does not account for the fact tha 
the brightest individuals in our total group are practical; 
all boys. On the above theory the girls would hav 
greater opportunity than the boys of being represented it 
the superior groups. It appears to indicate a fundamen 
tal difference in favor of the boys. It might be though 
that our tests favored the boys, but since girls in the ele 
mentary grades make better scores on the same group o 
tests this objection would have no weight. The mor 
rapid development of the girls under fourteen woul 
hardly be sufficient to account for the results, if the test 
actually favored the boys. 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  
SEX DIFFERENCES 291 
The fact that the boys rank higher on the mental tests 
an do the girls, while the girls are rated higher in their 
hool work and so are more often accelerated and less 
ften retarded, may be explained in a number of ways. 
1) The school work may be better adapted to the special 
terests and abilities of the girls. By the curriculum 
iven, by excessive memory work, and by routine proce- 
ure, the high school work may appeal more strongly to the 
terests and special abilities of the girls. (2) The girls 
ay possess special mental characteristics necessary for     
   
   
   
   
    
        
    
       
   chool success— such as good memories, perseverance, con- 
cientiousness, etc.—not so generally possessed by the boys. 
3) The school may fail to reach and appeal to the real 
eeds and interest of the boys as well as it does to the 
irls. Whatever the causes, they should be determined, 
specially the factors which make a seemingly superior 
roup of boys fail where a mentally inferior group of girls 
succeed. The causes for this situation should be accu- 
ately determined and an adjustment made which would 
revent in the future this great social and human waste. 
That the brightest boys prefer mathematics and science 
hile the brightest girls prefer Latin and English suggests 
real and perhaps a fundamental sex difference in mental 
apacity, which can only be accurately determined by 
‘urther psychological investigation. It is more than likely 
that there are certain mental characteristics or abilities 
in which men excel as a class, and others in which women 
are clearly superior. It should be determined by careful 
experimentation whether or not this is the case and in 
what respects the sexes differ. Future mental surveys 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
    299 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
GL 
Bbd all experimental work in psychology should take thi 
problem into account. 
The fourth result revealed by this comparative stud, 
of the intelligence scores of the sexes is socially and bio} 
logically significant. The fact that the boys from the da; 
laborer and skilled artisan class make a better rating o' 
the intelligence tests than the girls representing these sam 
occupational groups suggests either that many of the boy: 
coming from these occupational groups are not attendin, 
high school or that they have dropped out before reachin; 
senior standing to go to work while their equally dull si 
ters remain in school. This hypothesis will, however, no 
explain the marked mental superiority of the boys comin; 
from the professional and business executive groups, fo’ 
here we have a higher percentage of boys representin; 
these occupational groups. We also find that the boy: 
representing the wealthier groups rank much higher o 
the mental tests than do the girls representing identical 
groups. We would naturally expect the fathers of thes 
boys, the professional men, the business executives, an 
money makers to possess more than average mental ability, 
but whether this fact could affect the heredity of the boy: 
more than that of the girls we must leave for the biologists| 
to answer. The fact is that the boys belonging to these 
professional and wealthier groups make decidedly higher 
scores on our intelligence tests than do the girls coming} 
from the same occupational and economic classes, even 
when these groups seem to have more than their normal 
quota of boys in the high school.

PART III 
GENERAL CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION 
OF RESULTS 
CHAPTER XIV 
SITUATION REVEALED BY THE MENTAL SURVEY 
In Parts I and II of this report we have given little more 
han a bare statement of the aims of the survey and the 
esults which our study of the intelligence of high school 
eniors has revealed. In the present section we shall 
resent the conclusions which may be drawn from the 
oregoing data and discuss our results in the light of other 
nvestigations and certain social and educational problems 
f far-reaching practical importance to the state. 
1. High school seniors a highly selected group. The 
rst important fact which stands out prominently in our 
esults is that high school seniors, and to a marked degree 
ll high school students, are a select group of young people. 
he high schools of the state are in a real sense class schools, 
planned and conducted for young people who possess more 
than average mental capacity or who possess native mental 
ability of a certain sort. All occupational and economic 
classes found in the state are represented in these schools 
293

  294 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
and in the senior classes of these schools in so far as the; 
have children of the mental caliber and mental type whi 
the high school conserves. But school statistics sho 
that relatively few pupils who enter the public school: 
remain in school long enough to enter high school, that o 
those entering the high school about one-third drop ow 
the first year, and that on the average only about 10 o: 
15 per cent of those who started in the first grade remai: 
to complete a high school course.? 
It has also been shown that most of this eliminatio: 
before and after entrance to high school is due either t 
inferior mental ability or to a lack of the particular type o: 
ability which the high schools foster.2, Proctor showed tha’ 
students with an I. Q. below 90 rarely enter high schoo) 
and that those with an I. Q. below 100 usually drop ow 
during the first year. We may conclude that the hig! 
school seniors we tested in this investigation were a highl, 
selected group, mentally superior to even the averag 
high school student. They are the best of a select group o 
superior individuals and represent the best mentally en: 
dowed young people in the state so far as the high school: 
are able to select and conserve them. 
That they possess a rather special type of mental en: 
dowment is suggested by the fact that different school sub: 
jects (e.g. the academic and vocational) have been show: 
to require for success different grades and perhaps kinds o 
mental ability. And since our high schools have develope

   mly certain types of curricula, the talents and mental 
apacities of young people with special mechanical, 
usical, artistic, and other special capacities and interests 
ave not, as a rule, been conserved and cultivated by the 
igh school. Students with these types of special mental 
bility were rarely represented in the senior classes tested, 
$ was shown in Chapters VII and VIII. 
2. Individual differences among high school seniors. 
otwithstanding this selective feature of the high school, 
hich makes it possible for only the “fittest” to survive 
ntil graduation day by the constant elimination of those 
ith the more inferior grades of mental ability, marked 
ndividual differences in intellectual capacity occur among 
he members of any single senior class, between the senior 
lasses representing different schools, and the seniors com- 
ing from different communities and different sections of 
he state. In fact, the range of individual differences 
‘ound among this selected group is almost as wide as that 
xisting among any group of unselected individuals that 
as been tested. Five per cent of our total group made a 
core on the intelligence tests above 164 points out of a 
ossible score of 190. Some individuals fell as low as 40. 
alf of our total group made scores ranging from 124 to 
148 points; 5 per cent made scores ranging from 40 to 102. 
‘o per cent of the total group made the superior grade of 
A+ intelligence for high school seniors. 
3. Distribution of seniors with the most superior grade 
lof intelligence. Individuals with this most superior grade 
lof intelligence, i.e. those whose mental test scores placed 
them in the highest 1 or 2 percentile group, were found in
-P-A-G-E-314
  296 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  every section of the state; in every kind of high school 
from the smallest and weakest to the largest and best; i 
every type of community — rural, manufacturing, and ur. 
ban; in every occupational class ; and in all economic strat: 
except the wealthiest; though not in equal pro 
portions. They were not found in all individual hig 
schools of the state nor in every senior class, but there i: 
evidence that a proportionately greater number of in 
dividuals belonging to this most superior group come fro 
the rural and agricultural sections of the state than fro: 
any other type of community. 
4. Special abilities of the brightest seniors not full: 
conserved. A fourth fact which stands out prominentl, 
in our results is that the high schools are imperfectl. 
adapted to the varied capacities, interests, and vocational! 
needs of their students. They accelerate too few of thei 
students. The brightest seniors in the state are not s 
lected either by the high school or the elementary school 
for special advancement. Those accelerated possess, as 
tule, only a high average grade of intelligence, while some 
members of the most superior groups of seniors were re- 
tarded by the school one or more times. A few individuals 
with inferior ability have been accelerated by the school, 
while practically all (91 per cent) of the seniors possessing 
the most superior grades of intelligence were only regularly 
promoted along with those who possess the most inferior 
grades of mental ability found among high school seniors. 
Summarizing all results on this point, we find that more 
than twice as many seniors were kept four full years on 
their high school course as possessed an average grade of
-P-A-G-E-315
  
SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 297 
    
     
      
      
    
    
     
    
  ntelligence. About seven times as many possessed the 
ost superior grades of intelligence as were actually per- 
itted to shorten their high school course, while less than 
ne-third of the group possessing the most inferior grades 
f intelligence were actually retarded by the high school. 
We may conclude either that individuals with very 
superior mental ability cannot be easily and surely located 
yy teachers and school officials or that they possess no 
dequate idea with regard to what might reasonably be 
xpected from or done for such superior individuals. Our 
ata show that many seniors in the 320 high schools tested 
ave been working far below the level of their best standard 
f achievement, and hence are acquiring habits of ineffi- 
iency because their high school work is so poorly adapted 
© their intellectual capacities and needs. It seems to be 
habit of high school officials to keep their students four 
ull years on the course regardless of their ability to do the 
ork, thereby encouraging the formation of habits of 
ental laziness, which will serve as a permanent handicap 
‘o the realization of the best potentialities of their most 
superior students. 
That the high schools of the state are not succeeding in 
securing from their students results commensurate with 
their actual ability was further shown by our comparisons 
of each senior’s intelligence score with his scholastic rec- 
ord. These comparisons showed that while the correla- 
tion between native mental ability and school success was 
in general rather high, many students who give unmistak- 
able signs of possessing superior mental ability fail in their 
school work, while others with inferior ability are eminently
-P-A-G-E-316
  298 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
successful. Many boys with very superior mental abilit 
make poor or mediocre records in high school, while girl 
with greatly inferior mental ability surpass them. 
These facts, we believe, cannot be fully accounted fo: 
by assuming that the girls and the individual seniors wh 
were more successful with their school work possess men 
tal characteristics important for school success lacking i 
those who fail in their school work or possessed by them i 
a much less degree. They doubtless mean that the wor' 
of the high school is at present ill adapted to the interest: 
and intellectual needs of many superior students (nearl: 
all boys) who fail or make a poor scholastic record in hig! 
school. 
It has also been shown in the preceding chapters tha’ 
this maladjustment is worse in the high school than in th 
elementary grades, a most significant fact when we reflec 
that the most superior youths of the state are found in th 
high school, where they are not being dealt with on th 
basis of mental strength or intellectual interests. Thi 
comes about, in part, because the individuals with th 
most superior grades of intelligence cannot be easily an 
surely located ; in part, because teachers and school official 
do not realize what should be expected from young people 
who differ so greatly in intellectual capacity or what should 
be done for individuals possessing such superior grades of 
mental ability to induce them to put forth their best efforts 
and so obtain results commensurate with their ability. 
5. Brightest seniors not going to college. It is still 
more significant that so many of this most superior group 
of high school seniors will not attend college, while those
-P-A-G-E-317
  SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 299 
ith the most inferior grades of intelligence are planning 
attend, in ever increasing numbers.!_ Twenty-five per 
nt of the brightest seniors found in the entire state said 
hey were not planning to attend college at all, while 65 to 
0 per cent of the dullest seniors had definitely decided to 
‘o to college, most of them having already selected the 
ollege they expected to attend. 
No systematic attempt has hitherto been made by the 
lleges of this or any other state to locate definitely 
Ihe high school seniors who possess the most superior 
rades of intelligence or to make suitable provisions for 
mserving their special mental abilities by the right kind 
f education or training. Some colleges and universities 
se the results of intelligence tests as requirements for 
dmission. But such attempts at selection conserve only 
he best of those who apply for admission. They do not 
each the superior individuals who do not go to college, 
any of whom, doubtless, have been eliminated from our 
chools even before completing a high school course. It is 
he fact that the best young people have not been selected 
nd encouraged to attend our colleges and universities, 
vhile large numbers of those with inferior grades of mental 
bility have been flocking to our colleges in ever increasing 
umbers, which accounts for a situation prevalent in 
any colleges and universities to-day — a situation where 
e have literally thousands of students interested in little 
Ise than having a good time for three or four years, “mak- 
1 Since the number of individuals in any state who possess superior 
nd very superior ability is limited, the marked increase in attendance 
in our colleges must come from those who possess the more inferior grades 
f intelligence.
-P-A-G-E-318
  300 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
ing a fraternity,” or converting the college, so far as lie 
within their power, into a mere fashionable club for thi 
unambitious well-to-do youths of our land. 
Most colleges and universities have taken definite step 
to meet this situation by raising their standards of scholai 
ship. In this manner large numbers of students who ar 
intellectually unable to do the work or who are not inte! 
ested in the work are eliminated each year. But few ii 
stitutions make any pretense of adjusting their work 
the special abilities of their brightest students, except b. 
occasionally permitting ambitious students to do mor 
than the average amount of work, and so to complete thei 
college course in less than normal time. The latter pla: 
is pretty generally in vogue, but at no college, to the writer’ 
knowledge, is it so administered that the committee wh 
grants the permission to take extra studies can actuall 
ascertain what might reasonably be expected from th 
student who is asking for this privilege. The only cri 
terion of judgment used is the student’s past scholasti 
record. Hisreal intellectual capacity, if considered at alll 
is estimated on an insufficient basis. So far as the write’ 
is aware, no means are at present available in any univer: 
sity whereby those students who could do three or fo 
times the amount of work done by the average studen 
are required to take extra work or in other ways helpe 
to make the most of their superior ability. No machiner. 
is at present available for convincing professors and in: 
structors of the fact that such students, if given the oppor- 
tunity, could and would do such a superior grade of work. 
Neither do we have any administrative machinery withi
-P-A-G-E-319
  SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 301 
e college for locating such superior students in their 
eshman year or ascertaining with scientific exactness 
hat might reasonably be expected from individuals with 
eir type of ability. No method has yet been devised 
determine what ought to be done for such superior in- 
viduals, for the simple reason that up to the present 
me we have had no reliable way of locating them. 
It should be added that most colleges and universities, 
ough their deans, administrative officers, and individual 
structors, are striving to solve this problem, which, be- 
use of its complexity and delicacy, presents difficulties 
most insurmountable. For its solution the technique 
ind method of the mental survey, recommended below, 
mes as an invaluable instrument. For as the method 
f the survey is improved, we shall be enabled not merely 
locate and conserve the talents and capacities of the 
est young people in the state, but to evaluate the work of 
ll college students in the light of their native mental en- 
lowment, and so to get a more accurate measure of what 
ay reasonably be expected from students, who vary so 
eatly in native mental ability. 
6. Ablest students not located by the high school. It 
also true that few provisions are made at present by our 
igh schools to locate the students who are equipped best 
entally ; or to minister to them in accordance with their 
ipecial capacities and individual needs. There is, on 
he other hand, considerable evidence in our data that the 
pecial abilities of the most superior students are often 
mothered by the leveling-down process which is so popular 
our schools, and by the fact that the work of the school
-P-A-G-E-320
302 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  is not adapted to their mental capacity nor results d 
manded commensurate with their ability. 
7. Vocational needs of individuals and state not ad 
quately met. Another situation revealed by the surv 
is the fact that high school students are not being proper! 
equipped by the school for their vocation in life. We ha 
just pointed out that neither in the high school nor in t! 
college is the work well adapted to the mental ability 
the students; that their education and training is n 
being carried on in strict accordance with the ment: 
capacity of the individual students; that the brighte: 
students are not being adequately taken care of. T 
plan has been to measure educational progress by the ti 
required to complete a set traditional course, original 
designed for a very special group of individuals, not 
unselected group, composed of individuals possessing 
grades and kinds of mental and physical ability, such 
we meet when we organize a school in a democracy. O1 
results clearly show that the work of our schools is not 
organized or administered as to fit individuals, who vai 
so greatly in their native mental and physical endowmen 
most economically and efficiently for their duties in life. 
What is just as significant as this failure in the conse 
vation of capacities and talents is the fact that the voce 
tional needs of the state are not being met in a satisfactor 
way. Only sixteen lines of work were selected as life occt 
pations by our total group of 6188 high school senior 
The high schools seem, therefore, to be directing the 
students towards a limited number of lines of work, an 
are not meeting the vocational needs of a modern dem¢ 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 303 
atic state, where all types and grades of talents and 
ility should be conserved by education and training. 
The plan has been and still is to give certain courses of 
escribed work in the high school. If this work cannot 
done by the student or does not meet his intellectual 
d vocational needs, the student must try to adapt himself 
what is given. Little attempt is made to educate him 
accordance with his abilities or actual life needs. The 
inciple promulgated in the parable of the talents by the 
reat Teacher is being ignored or at least not practically 
plied in our educational work to-day. We have people 
the state who are mere “hewers of wood and drawers 
water” who should have been directed towards and 
ained for higher types of work. 
We must conclude that wiser educational and vocational 
idance is needed in all our educational work if we 
uld conserve and cultivate the capacities and abilities 
our young people in all their variety and richness. Less 
an two-thirds of the seniors taking our mental tests had 
osen their vocation in life. And the boys and girls 
ming into the high school from all occupational classes 
d from different economic groups are being uncon- 
iously directed towards a few lines of work. Evidence 
also at hand which shows that little attention is 
ven to the matter of selecting a life career even by 
igh school seniors or college freshmen. Many of these 
ung people are more or less adrift so far as their life 
ork is concerned. Others are selecting occupations and 
tually planning to prepare for lines of work ill adapted 
their mental strength. The brightest girls in the entire
-P-A-G-E-322
304 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  state are planning to take up stenography and shorthan 
The dullest girls in our total senior group are planning 
enter the teaching profession. The boys selecting me 
cine and preparing to take a medical course rated on t! 
intelligence tests on a par with the group who chose a m 
chanical trade, and the girls selecting nursing ranked ne 
to the lowest occupational group. Moreover, the range 
intelligence for the seniors choosing the same occupati 
was in general very wide. The dullest and brightest it 
dividuals quite often chose the same occupation. 
some of these occupations, teaching and business fi 
example, there is opportunity for the exercise of the f 
mental capacities of the brightest seniors. The onl 
social waste and tragedy in such cases would be the fail: 
of those too weak mentally to compete. But other occt 
pations chosen by the brightest seniors require only 
average or an inferior grade of high school intelligence f 
success. Such occupations are often chosen by the brigh’ 
est seniors, while inferior seniors in preponderati: 
numbers select such occupations as teaching, medicin 
and nursing, all of which demand the highest type of inte’ 
lectual capacity. ‘ 
From these and other facts revealed in this study 
must conclude that the students in our high schools nee 
more efficient vocational guidance than the schools are 
present able to give them. In no other way shall we b 
able to conserve and cultivate to the fullest extent t 
capacities and talents of all young people in the state. 
8. Individual differences in vocational and scholasti 
interests. Marked differences are also found between th
-P-A-G-E-323
  
SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 805 
ocational and scholastic interests of the students now 
ttending our high schools. This was shown not merely 
yy the preferences which these students showed for differ- 
nt high school studies, the various life occupations they 
elected, and the type of high school course pursued, but 
yv the general level of intelligence of the individuals belong- 
ing to our total senior group. There are marked individ- 
al differences not only in amount of intellectual capacity 
ut also in kind. But the varieties of interest and ability 
indicated by our results fall far short of the varieties found 
n actual life. We must, therefore, conclude that the high 
chool as now organized and conducted is more or less of a 
elective agency, eliminating many young people from its 
courses who do not possess the type of interest or 
‘ind and degree of mental ability fostered by its present 
urriculum. 
9. American high school not truly democratic. From 
ur own data and the results obtained by other investi- 
ators we conclude that the American high school is not 
emocratic in the best sense. All occupational groups and 
Il economic classes had representatives in the high schools 
ested and in the senior classes of these schools, as we have 
shown in Chapters X and XI. But such students as do 
ttend and remain to graduate have the type of mental 
bility and the degree of native mental endowment re- 
uired to do the work that is prescribed in the course. 
A marked difference was found in the intellectual level of 
he seniors pursuing different types of high school courses — 
he academic, the classical, and the commercial and voca- 
ional courses. It was also found that the brightest students
-P-A-G-E-324
  306 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
prefer certain types of studies, suchas science, mathematic 
and foreign language. The seniors with the most inferi 
grades of native mental ability prefer the so-called voce: 
tional courses. A number of years ago the duller student 
or those with a “non-academic” mind, who could n 
succeed in Latin or mathematics, were dumped into th| 
commercial course. But as has been pointed out b 
Terman and others! the teachers of these subjects soo. 
sensed the situation and began raising their standards it 
order to eliminate these inferior students from their course: 
Now we find the students who are taking the co 
mercial courses in high school occupying second place ani 
the dullest seniors pursuing a vocational course. (Compar 
Chapter VIII above.) But in Indiana a reaction agains| 
admitting the duller students to these vocational course 
has already set in, for the teachers of these subjects and th 
vocational directors of the state are advocating daily tha 
only the brightest students should be admitted to th 
vocational course, saying that “it takes a bright boy to b 
a mechanic,” ete. The fact is that young people below 
certain level of general intelligence and those possessin, 
specific mechanical, musical, and artistic abilities are no 
being properly taken care of by our elementary and hig 
schools for reasons that are apparent to all. 
The problem is how to conserve and cultivate the ca 
pacities and talents of all grades and kinds of individuals} 
This is not now being done and probably cannot be a 
complished until those in charge of our educational wor'

Mifflin & Co., 1919, p. 90. 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 307 
hange their point of view. To be truly democratic and 
lo meet the needs of a democracy our public schools, from 
lhe kindergarten to the university, must be so organized 
nd conducted that the abilities and capacities of all grades 
nd types of children will be fully conserved and cultivated.t 
10. High school better adapted to the interests and 
eeds of the girls. Another important situation re- 
ealed by the survey is that the high school work seems 
etter adapted to the interests, capacities, and intellectual 
eeds of the girls than the boys. This is suggested by the 
act that the girls are more rapidly advanced by the school 
nd are rated consistently higher on their scholastic work 
han the boys, notwithstanding the fact that the boys 
ho remain to graduate and with whom these girls are 
competing give unmistakable signs of possessing superior 
ntellectual ability. 
For some reason or reasons not made clear by the survey 
he high school girls succeed better with their school work 
han the boys. Girls with inferior grades of ability suc- 
eed where boys with far superior ability fail, or make 
scholastic rating much below that given to the girls 
ursuing the same courses. 
On the basis of our present results we cannot say any- 
thing definite with regard to the intellectual superiority of 
one or the other sex. What is established by our data is 
the fact that senior high school boys ranked decidedly and 
consistently higher on the intelligence tests than did the 
virls; that the higher up in the scale of intelligence we go 
the greater is the proportion of boys; that notwithstand- 
1 For a further discussion of this point see section 4 of Chapter XV below.
-P-A-G-E-326
    308 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
ing the mental superiority of this select group of boys, th 
girls belonging to the same classes are rated higher on thei 
high school work and are advanced more rapidly and con: 
sistently by the school than the boys; lastly, that a marke 
difference exists between the scholastic and vocational 
interests of the boys and girls which strongly suggests 
fundamental sex difference in the mental capacity of th 
sexes and may help to explain why the high schools of th 
state as now organized and conducted seem better adapte 
to the interests and intellectual need of the girls. 
11. Class, school, and community differences impor: 
tant. We should also point out that differences in th 
intellectual capacity of groups of individuals — senio 
classes, the same grades in different schools, difference 
between individual schools, between schools or grades i 
different types of communities, and between the individ. 
uals coming from different sections of a state — may be a: 
great and just as significant for the proper solution of cer- 
tain educational and social problems as the differences 
between individuals, though we need different methods 
for their determination and measurement. From the 
data at hand it is obvious that these group differences are 
not clearly recognized by school officials. Most people do 
not know that they exist. The scholastic agcomplish- 
ment of a class, grade, or school, and of a school system 
located in any part of the state is still being judged by 
standards of achievement obtained from without the sys- 
tem, community, or section, and with little or no regard 
for the actual mental capacity of the classes, grades, schools, 
or school systems, whose educational accomplishment
-P-A-G-E-327
  
  SITUATION REVEALED BY SURVEY 309 
being evaluated. In this manner the results obtained 
yy a teacher in a school where 51 per cent of the pupils are 
und to be feebleminded,! are judged by the same stand- 
rds of accomplishment as the work of a teacher in a 
chool where 90 per cent of the pupils make an A or B 
telligence rating, for their age or grade. 
At present the achievements of individual high schools 
in all parts of the state are evaluated by the state high 
chool inspector regardless of these group and community 
ifferences in the raw human material with which the 
chool must work. Moreover, colleges and universities 
ssume that the native mental endowment of the seniors 
oming from all commissioned high schools and from every 
community and section of the state is the same or at least 
standard if only they have completed a prescribed four- 
ear course of study. Our mental survey has shown that 
his is not the case. It has shown not merely that these 
‘oup differences exist, but why they must be taken into 
ccount in the solution of many of our most important 
ocial and educational problems. 
12. Intelligence no guarantee of school success. Lastly, 
rom our own data and from the facts revealed by other 
nvestigations made in our laboratory we must conclude 
hat intelligence tests are not adequate for prognosticat- 
ing an individual’s school success. Mere ability to 
learn will not insure its accomplishment. Ability to per- 
form is not synonymous with actual performance. Mere

  310 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
intellectual capacity, or the ability to do school work 
will not insure successful work, though it is a necessar. 
precondition, and one of the most important factors i 
bringing it about. Our results clearly show that a senior’: 
success in school is conditioned by other factors beside: 
his intellectual capacity. Many seniors endowed wit! 
the highest grade of intelligence are failing in school o: 
making only mediocre success, while others with averag 
or seemingly inferior grades of intelligence are being regu 
larly promoted. We conclude that other mental character. 
istics, such as persistence, effort, and mental attitud 
towards the teacher and school, play an important réle i 
achieving success in school. These facts point not only t 
the need of having reliable tests for measuring such mental

that teachers should appeal to them and, so far as possible, 
cultivate and improve them, since they are necessary not} 
merely for success in school, but probably also for attain-

      ADJUSTMENTS AND REFORMS SUGGESTED BY 
THE SURVEY; THE CONSERVATION OF HUMAN 
CAPACITIES AND TALENTS 
Tue goal of all science and the aim of most scientists is 
‘ discover the facts needed to guide human aspirations 
nd conduct. No human endeavor is worthy the name of 
cience unless it results in the finding or verification of such 
‘acts. We would therefore fall short of our duty if we 
ailed to indicate some of the ways in which the facts re- 
ealed by this survey might be used as a basis for further 
xperimentation and as a guide for the solution of some of 
he present-day social and educational problems to which 
hey pertain. We might legitimately be accused of sci- 
ntific laziness if we failed to point out some of the read- 
justments which should be made to remedy the situation 
n the colleges and schools revealed by the survey, or if we 
ailed to make such suggestions for the improvement of 
hese conditions as to us seem warranted by the facts. We 
shall, therefore, in this and the following chapters attempt 
to point out the practical significance of some of the facts 
which the survey has revealed and make such suggestions 
for needed educational readjustments as in our judgment 
are warranted by the facts.

1. Change needed in our point of view. The fact! 
obtained in this survey point, first of all, and most co 
clusively, perhaps, to the need for a change in our point of 
view with regard to what formal education in a democra: 
can and should be expected to accomplish. Our school} 
were originally planned to meet the intellectual and pra 
tical needs of a few individuals; namely, teachers, mi 
isters, and lawyers. Their work has since been graduall. 
extended in scope until they now attempt to serve all classe! 
of people in the state, with all the variety of interest: 
degrees of intellectual capacity, and diversity of vocationa 
needs which the life of our entire population present: 
The wide individual differences in capacities and interest: 
and in the intellectual and vocational requirements whicl 
such an unselected mass of people presents, need to b 
more fully and keenly recognized by all who are engage 
in educational work. The wide divergence in intellectua’ 
capacity, in the intellectual and vocational needs of thi 
heterogeneous group should not merely be recognized, bu’ 
its educational significance should be more clearly under. 
stood. We should understand better just what should b 
expected from and what ought to be done for young peopl 
who differ so tremendously in mental capacity, in intel 
lectual interest, and in their life or vocational needs. 
We also need to recognize what successful education i 
a democracy really means. If all are to be educated, the 
variety of abilities, intellectual interests, and the individual 
needs of all must not only be recognized, but met in the 
best way possible. We must know the best that education 
can do for or with such a heterogeneous group. We need
-P-A-G-E-331
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 313 
o remember that in any large unselected group of indi- 
iduals or in the average school grade or group there are 
bout as many individuals with very superior intellectual 
ndowment as there are pupils who are mentally deficient 
in a marked degree ; that their superiority is really present 
hen these children enter school; and that it persists as 
constant factor in their life. We must remember also 
hat it is a natural or normal situation for some individuals 
o be superior in intellectual capacity while others are 
eficient ; that this superiority is usually general rather 
an freakish or one-sided, although some individuals 
robably do possess special mental abilities to a marked 
egree ; and that there are definite limits for the mental 
ccomplishments of those whose mental endowment is 
below the average for any unselected group. We should 
so remember that such mentally deficient or intellectually 
superior individuals may be located by means of reliable 
intelligence tests in any class or school; that the school 
laccomplishment of each individual should be measured in 
the light of his native mental endowment; and that the 
work of a teacher or the educational accomplishment of a 
class or school cannot be justly evaluated or correctly 
measured unless the mental capacity of the “pupil mate- 
rial” is taken into account. It is also important to remem- 
ber that the individuals with superior ability are more 
difficult to recognize and locate without mental tests than 
the mentally deficient ; that the talents of this most su- 
perior group of individuals should be specially conserved 
and assiduously cultivated because they become the lead- 
ers of society in every line of work; and finally that in a 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
    314 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
democracy the talents of all individuals, the mediocre an 
weak along with the best, should be zealously conserve 
and cultivated in accordance with the principle set fort! 
in the parable of the talents by the Great Teacher. Thi: 
ideal conception of efficient education in a democracy need: 
to be more fully and keenly recognized, because the in- 
tellectual abilities of the people of any generation or sta’ 
constitute its most precious asset. 
On account of traditional tendencies in education an 
the ideas we have held in the past about the meaning an 
purposes of human life, our schools have been made mor 
of a general leveling agency than is suited to a democrati 
society. The tendency has been to try to bring all up t 
certain standards of attainment and to demand from all 
certain traditional types of intellectual achievement rathe 
than to try to conserve and cultivate by means of educa-| 
tion all types of worthy capacities and interests. 
In the light of the marked individual and group differ- 
ences revealed by this study it will be seen why this cannot} 
be done. We need, therefore, not merely to understand 
the diversity of the differences found among the young} 
men and women in our colleges and schools, but also to 
recognize that in a democracy this diversity of talent’ 
should be fully cultivated and conserved. Ina democracy, 
where all should be educated and helped, the correct and 
efficient thing to do is to educate and train all in ways 
which will develop to the fullest extent the peculiar abilities 
of each individual so far as these conform to the standards 
and ideals held by organized society to-day. In a word, 
we need to break away from set courses and superimposed
-P-A-G-E-333
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 315 
tandards, and regard education more as a process of con= 
erving and cultivating human capacities and talents in all 
heir variety and richness. 
2. Talents of the best should be especially cultivated 
d conserved. We should, first of all, make every pos- 
ible attempt to conserve and cultivate the mental capaci- 
ies and talents of the most gifted young people in the state. 
efinite, workable schemes for the location of such in- 
ividuals should be devised and used continuously from 
he kindergarten to the university, because such differences 
anifest themselves very early and remain more or less 
constant as mental development proceeds. 
The primary purpose of this investigation was to locate 
y means of group intelligence tests the best intellectually 
ndowed young men and women graduating from the high 
chools of one state and to make arrangements whereby 
his group of superior young people might be encouraged 
nd helped to continue their education in a college or 
niversity. This we believe is one of the most important 
roblems confronting the colleges and high schools of the 
tate. Our data show that about 25 per cent of 
his group of superior young people are not even planning 
© continue their education beyond the high school stage, 
hile 65 to 70 per cent of the high school seniors who pos- 
ss only average or inferior grades of intelligence 
re planning to go to college. Some workable plan 
should therefore be devised whereby the young people 
ho possess the most superior grades of native mental 
ndowment might be definitely located and encouraged 
obtain a college education.

   316 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
But what is equally important is to adapt the work o! 
the high school and college to the intellectual needs o 
these superior individuals. This will require a new an 
radically different treatment, for such individuals do no 
need the same kind or amount of help that should be give: 
to a student with only average ability. Many brillian 
young people now in college are frittering away their tim 
by taking only the normal amount of work. Colleg 
authorities and teachers should therefore work out th 
best things to do for such a superior group of individual: 
to induce them to put forth their best efforts and so 
make the most of their opportunities and ability. The 
should really be located as soon as they enter the hig 
school so that the work there could be adjusted to thei 
mental strength and intellectual interests and needs, as i 
not now done in any systematic way. 
There is unmistakable evidence in our data that thi 
group of superior individuals often have their intellectual 
interests dulled in high school because they are not give 
the kind and amount of work required to occupy thei 
minds fully or to satisfy their mental curiosity. Th 
work they are required to take is often not adapted t 
their intellectual interests or needs. Instead of stimulat 
ing the development of their superior abilities they ar 
treated in ways which favor the development of habits o 
intellectual laziness because they are encouraged to worl 
far below the level of their best attainment. This no 
only means a handicap and loss to the individual, but 
waste to society and the world. 
Public school authorities and teachers need also to re
-P-A-G-E-335
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 317 
gnize that the individuals who possess these most su- 
erior grades of intellectual capacity may be located when 
hey enter school t and the work conducted in a way that 
ould be most helpful to them. Primary and all grade 
leachers in the public school need to understand better 
han they do just what may reasonably be expected from 
nd what should be done for the children in their classes 
ho possess the most superior grades of intelligence. 
3. All types and grades of mental ability important. 
ome rather narrow views have been held with regard to 
lhe true meaning of democracy and in regard to what sort 
f education was needed in a democratic state. A de- 
ocracy does not mean that all are alike or that they 
should be made alike by education and training, even if 
his could be done. Democracy means opportunity. It 
eans that each individual should be given an opportunity 
jo make the most out of his life and native capacities that 
ls possible for him, the same as every other individual in 
he state. Socially it means that all grades and types of 
pacity and talents be conserved to society and the world. 
1The best, and probably the most widely used, group scale of intelli- 
ence for use in the first three grades is the Primer Scale, devised by 
rs. S. L. Pressey, Research Fellow in Psychology, Indiana University. 
he scale is easy to give, easy to score, and carefully standardized in 
rocedure and objective in scoring. Also (no small merit) the materials 
re comparatively inexpensive. This scale may be had in any quantity 
yy addressing the Department of Psychology, Indiana University, 
loomington, Indiana. The Dearborn scale is also used extensively, 
ut the timing and scoring on this test are very inexact, and the materials 
xpensive. Among other examinations for the elementary grades may be 
entioned the Otis and Haggerty scales (World Book Company, Yonkers, 
. Y.) and the Kingsbury scale (Public School Publishing Company, 
loomington, Illinois). 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
318 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  The most efficient and economic scheme of education in 
democracy is one, therefore, which insures the full develo 
ment of all individual capacities and talents in all thei 
variety and richness to the end that the best interes 
of both the individual and state may be most full 
served. 
One of the most needed readjustments suggested by ou 
data is a better adaptation of the school to the capacitie' 
and needs of those who possess the most inferior grades o 
mental ability found among the heterogeneous group o 
individuals who now attend the public schools. Ow 
schools have been developed to take care of our futur 
leaders and those who are most fortunately endowed. Bu 
with the growth of the democratic ideal and the passag: 
of compulsory education laws we have been forced to tak 
special care of those who are mentally deficient, becaus: 
this problem was forced upon our attention by their utte! 
inability to do the regular school work. But we need t 
realize better than we do what actually can and ought t 
be done for this deficient class. The tendency in th 
schools for the feebleminded, in schools for the handicapped 
blind, in the special classes arranged by the public schoo! 
to care for this mentally defective group, has been to give 
them the same course of study used with normal children 
or, to be more exact, a course which was originally planned 
for a group of students who expected to take -up the more 
intellectual pursuits of present day society. Can the mea. 
ger talentsof this unfortunate group, we should ask, best be 
cultivated by a course of study which has been developed 
for this professional class? Will the present school cours
-P-A-G-E-337
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 319 
them best for the work in life which they really can or 
ght to be trained to do, or must they be taken care of 
a different way ? 
But standing between this most inferior group and the 
perior individuals referred to in the previous section of 
is chapter are many individuals who vary greatly in 
tellectual capacity. Still the practice of the school-has 
leen to try to meet the intellectual as well as the vocational 
leeds of all these individuals in the same way, by means 
the same course of study and the same methods of in- 
truction, all of which have been developed those who 
re by nature more fortunately endowed. The result is 
at large numbers of individuals possessing the more in- 
rior grades of mental ability fail in their school work year 
{ter year and are finally forced out of school at the age of 
urteen with an education totally inadequate to meet 
eir vocational needs. Perhaps the most prominent thing 
ey have obtained from their school experience is the 
abit of failing at most things which they were asked to do, 
ecause the work was ill adapted to their mental strength 
md personal needs. That the meager talents of these 
‘oung people cannot be developed and made most service- 
ble to themselves and to the world by such educational 
rocedure is demonstrated by the fact that they are forced 
ut of school as soon as the law permits them to leave, hav- 
g completed only the work of the first three or four grades. 
ome continue until they complete the work of the eighth 
rade and are then eliminated, chiefly because they lack 
Ihe mental ability to do the amount or kind of intellectual 
ork emphasized by the present school course. Many try

high school and are weeded out there the first or secon 
year for the same reason. 
One of the important questions raised by our data j 
whether our present educational procedure which conservi 
the individuals who possess superior intelligence or ment: 
ability of a certain kind also succeeds equally well in d 
veloping other grades and typesof mental ability or wheth 
some rather radical readjustments should not be mad 
to adapt the work of the public schools better to the var 
ing capacities.and needs of all types of children who atten 
them. vo 
4, American schools and colleges should be mad 
more democratic. It should be clear from what has al 
ready been said that our schools cannot be considere: 
wholly democratic or thought of as serving the best need| 
of a modern democracy unless they take proper care of a 
types of people and educate them in accordance with theij 
intellectual capacity and actual needs. As has alread 
been pointed out the high school serves only a small pr 
portion of the total population, largely because those wit! 
the more inferior grades of mental ability have been force 
out of school. Reform after reform has been attempte 
to make our high schools more widely serviceable to th 
young people of the state. At first they were mainl 
preparatory schools for the college. But it was soon foun 
that so many young people who attended the high scho 
would not attend college that arrangements had to be mad 
to try to serve these also. In attempting to make th 
work more serviceable to this larger group, various su 
jects have been added to the traditional curriculw

  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 321 
any so-called practical subjects, which make a wider 
ppeal and which presumably do not require the same kind 
r amount of mental ability demanded by such subjects 
s mathematics and Latin, have been added to the tradi- 
ional list of studies offered. But the teachers of these more 
ractical subjects soon began to raise their standards and 
o forced out of their classes and out of the high school 
hose with grades of mental ability slightly inferior to the 
etter high school students. The same tendency is now 
anifesting itself with regard to the vocational courses

cademic courses. How, we should ask, can the high school 
nd its work be made more truly democratic? And how

he same time preserving and fostering that select group of 
oung people who possess the most superior grades of 
The problems presented by this situation are not simple 
r easy to solve and any perfect adjustment is doubtless 
long way off. But the issues involved should be squarely 
et and the problem solved as rapidly as possible. The 
ost pressing need which our data suggest is for making 
etter arrangements to take special care of that group of 
ery superior young people which we tried to locate by 
means of this survey. 
Individuals with the most superior grades of mental

  ability should be located in both the high school and th 
college, and arrangements made whereby their special tal 
ents might be fully and most economically cultivated. Ij 
would also seem possible to make a further differentiatio 
of the high school and college courses, and to make certai 
readjustments in the standards of admission to these in 
stitutions and to specific courses, which, among othe’ 
things, would set definite intellectual as well as academi 
standards of requirements for the different lines of ed: 
ucational work offered. If this or some similar line o: 
development is not followed the ever increasing demand: 
for a high school and college education and the growin 
enrollments will soon force a lowering of the standard: 
now held for the traditional courses, and will make it in. 
creasingly difficult for these institutions to take prope! 
care of that small group of superior students whom the 
were originally created to serve. 
5. Better provisions needed for vocational training 
Such an extension of the courses of study for the hig! 
schools and colleges would mean, first of all, better pro: 
visions for vocational education. This doubtless mean 
that a reorganization of our entire system of schools mus’ 
be made, or rather that their present duties and work b 
much extended. Some things can and will continue to b 
done, for the special groups now inadequately served, b: 
means of the traditional courses and the foundational wor 
required for all effective vocational training. But i 
should be clear that our present educational system i 
much too narrow to meet the needs of all the people an 
that in one sense our schools are really class schools appeal
-P-A-G-E-341
READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 323 
ing only to those who are most intellectually fit. It is the 
act that there are so many individuals who do not have 
he mental ability to complete the work even of the ele- 
entary grades, but who could be trained to do many 
seful lines of work, that calls special attention to the need 
‘or vocational education of an elementary grade. 
We have at one end of a complete scheme for vocational 
ducation the task of preparing the best individuals in the 
tate for such professions as engineering, medicine, law, 
tatesmanship,. and the like. This is now being success- 
ully done. We have at the other extreme the task of 
ducating those who are mentally deficient in a way that 
ill make them of as much service to themselves and to the 
orld as is possible. But we must also train in an effec- 
ive manner all those who fall in between these extremes. 
It is this fact which makes the problem of vocational edu- 
cation not merely tremendously important and pressing, 
ut immeasurably difficult, —a task which, if the thesis 
f this discussion is valid, marks the very culmination or 
lower of the entire educational process in a democracy. 
One of the most important readjustments, therefore, 
which the data of this survey suggest as urgently needed, 
lis some such extension of vocational training as is here 
suggested, for in no other way can all the abilities and 
capacities of all the people be fully conserved and made to 
function in the individual and social life of the state. 
6. Need for better educational and vocational guid- 
lance. If the talents and capacities of all our people are 
to be thus fully conserved and cultivated, there is need for 
ja special type of educational and vocational guidance, 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
324 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
which our high schools and colleges are at present unable| 
to give. Young people must not only be educated and 
trained in accordance with their ability, so that they may 
render to themselves and to the world their best service ; 
they should, so far as possible, be directed towards and 
educated for the work in life that is best suited to their} 
mental strength, and in harmony with their intellectual 
interest. 
This need for wiser educational and vocational guid- 
ance was impressed upon the writer in many scores of ways| 
as he worked with the data revealed by this survey. The 
problem as a whole will, perhaps, never be satisfactorily] 
solved. Yet the great social waste and individual dis-| 
couragements, which result from having men and women 
with mediocre ability engaged in tasks clearly beyond 
their intellectual capacity and competing with those who 
by their every act brand them a failure, should, as far as 
possible, be removed. It is only surpassed by the greater 
tragedy or failure of society and the school, which permits 
young people to choose and prepare for vocations in life 
infinitely below their level of mental ability and which 
therefore do not require the complete and healthy exercise 
of their minds. This situation, if permitted to exist and to 
take care of itself, will create a regular factory for the manu- 
facture of an army of malcontents and Bolsheviks who 
will seriously menace the future welfare of society. 
Teachers and school officials should, however, not be 
misled by the wild claims so often made by enthusiasts 
in the field of vocational education or by the statements 
and writings of amateur students of human nature who 
   
-P-A-G-E-343
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 325 
aint glowing pictures of what may be accomplished by 
eans of vocational guidance. Only a few things can 
nd very many more things cannot be done in this field 
ith our present knowledge. 
Perhaps we should talk more about educational and less 
bout vocational guidance than we do. The best and 
ractically the only contribution which can, at present, be 
ade to the solution of the problem of vocational guidance 
comes from the science of mental measurements. By 
eans of mental tests, reliable intelligence norms may be 
stablished for successful workers in the various profes- 
ional, semi-professional, skilled trade, business, and labor 
ursuits. As a result we will doubtless soon know what 
rade of mental capacity is required for success in these 
arious occupational fields. But many mental surveys 
ust be made before such norms can be satisfactorily 
stablished because it will be necessary in connection with 
he establishment of such norms to show the extremes of 
bility for each standard occupation below which failure 
is almost certain and above which an individual would be 
wasting his best efforts, because intellectual ability above 
that point was not required for success in that field of 
work. 
Results already obtained indicate clearly that for some 
vocations there is such a middle range of mental ability 
within which range one’s chances for success, if such a 
grade of ability be possessed, would be practically as- 
sured. Whereas an individual with less native mental 
ability would be almost certain to be a failure in that type 
of work. But even when such norms or standards have
-P-A-G-E-344
326 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  been established, the best we can do by means of intelli. 
gence tests is to determine in which occupational field o 
group of vocations a given individual is most likely t 
succeed. No data are available and no methods have ye 
been devised which would enable a teacher, parent, o: 
superintendent to determine with any degree of accurac 
which one of a hundred occupations a given individual i 
best fitted to take up. A child with average native mental 
ability or with super-intelligence may in all probability 
succeed equally well in a dozen vocations, if he happens to 
be interested in them all, or possesses certain other mental 
characteristics which are essential to success in those| 
fields. The best we can do at present is to make sure that 
our young people select occupations that are adapted to 
their particular grade and type of intelligence, and after 
this let natural interest and various practical and economic 
considerations determine which of the group of vocations 
demanding that grade of intelligence the individual should 
choose. 
But with educational guidance the case is different. If 
we assume that all young people should be prepared for 
the work in life that would enable them to make the great- 
est contribution to the world, we must conclude that vo- 
cational and educational guidance should go together. In 
fact educational direction must precede vocational guid- 
ance, for we assume that each child is to be educated fora 
certain line of work. Hence, one of the tasks of the teacher 
and the school becomes that of trying to find the best 
possible way of achieving just that result. Here the op- 
portunity of the teacher and educator becomes very great.
-P-A-G-E-345
READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 327 
  ‘hey become the specific agent of the state, baving in 
charge the sacred task of conserving all grades and types 
lof ability and talent found in the school. For only by 
such wise educational direction and by sharply directed 
instruction can each individual be educated in accordance 
with his native capacities and interests. 
Readjustments must, therefore, be made which will get 
lus away from the traditional procedure that has made our 
schools so much of a leveling agency, a procedure which 
forces those with the more inferior grades of mental 
lability to take school work that was originally designed for 
academically minded and intellectually superior individ- 
uals. If an individual cannot do this work, he is forced 
lout of the system, or hopelessly stranded somewhere along 
the line. If mental tests were resorted to and the native 
mental ability of all pupils approximately determined, 
special educational and vocational work might be arranged 
for all who are not now being adequately cared for by the 
school, more especially for the group who, no matter how 
long they attend or how hard they try to do the work 
prescribed by the traditional course, are doomed to failure 
because they do not possess the grade or kind of mental 
ability required to do that sort of intellectual work. If 
such a readjustment were made, we would have fewer 
educational tragedies than are now enacted in our public 
schools, because young people are required to do a type of 
work at which they can never succeed. 
In all this we have said nothing about the waste which 
results from the fact that those with special mechanical, 
musical, or artistic ability are required to pursue a tradi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
  328 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
tional academic course of study in the high school. But we 
hope it has been made clear that the giving of mental tests 
as a basis for wiser vocational and educational guidance 
is one of the means of reducing such waste and one of the 
needed readjustments which should be made in our edu- 
cational work. 
7. Group and community differences should be rec- 
ognized. So much for the readjustments needed to make 
proper adaptations to the marked individual differences 
which are found in our society and schools. But another 
situation has been revealed by the data collected in this 
survey and by other investigations recently made by 
means of intelligence tests. These make necessary a num- 
ber of readjustments in our educational procedure, on 
both its instructional and administrative sides. The fact 
that marked differences exist between the intellectual 
capacity of senior classes, between the native mental 
endowment of pupils belonging to the same grade but in 
different schools, between all the pupils in one school or 
building and the pupils attending another building or 
school in the same city, and finally between the pupils in 
the schools of one city or community and those of another— 
these group differences make it impossible to get the same 
grade or amount of work from these several groups of 
pupils. 
In measuring the educational accomplishment of any 
class, grade, or school, or in evaluating the work of any 
teacher, school, or school system, the fact of these group 
and community differences in the intellectual capacity of 
the raw human material with which teachers must work
-P-A-G-E-347
  READJUSTMENTS SUGGESTED BY SURVEY 329 
should be taken into account. They should also be con- 
idered when a decision is made in regard to what ought 
o be done for young people in such classes, grades, or 
chools. 
In the light of the facts regarding these group differences, 
tandards of school accomplishment and_ intellectual 
chievement for both individuals and classes or groups 
ecome only relative things and their school achievement 
ust be evaluated in the light of what may reasonably 
e expected from an individual, class, or school possessing 
heir particular type and grade of ability. 
8. New method needed for evaluating school accom- 
lishment. In deciding what can or ought to be done for a 
articular individual or group we need, therefore, a new 
ethod for evaluating their work. We need a method 
for measuring school achievement which will take into 
laccount the native mental ability of the individual, or 
group, as well as a standard which is applicable to a theo- 
retically average individual or which is demanded by the 
world. We need a method and standards for measuring 
progress in learning, rather than for measuring school 
achievement, standards which will enable us to measure 
progress in the type or kinds of learning which are actually 
going on. Teachers in dealing with individuals or classes, 
and superintendents in evaluating the work of a particular 
teacher or school as well as the work of their entire sys- 
tem, need to take into account the native mental endow- 
ment of the pupil material with which they and their 
teachers must work and evaluate school achievement in 
the light of the native mental ability of their pupils.
-P-A-G-E-348
    330 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
A new reliable and practical method for measurin, 
school accomplishment is therefore needed, one which will 
give us a new standard for measuring progress in school 
Only when such a standard or “ability index” has bee’ 
obtained, one which shows the ratio between intelligen: 
and actual progress in learning or school accomplishment 
one which is thoroughly practical and reliable, can th 
work of a pupil, the success of a teacher, or the accomplish 
ment of a class or school be justly evaluated. 
It should of course be remembered that it is still valuabl 
to measure the achievement of an individual, a class, or 
school, by a standard which the world has fixed, or stand: 
ards which have been obtained from a large group of un 
selected individuals. The reasons for this are apparent. 
Such a standard is helpful for purposes of educational an 
vocational guidance as it indicates the type of succes: 
which must be achieved by an individual if he desires 
be successful in a given line of work or is to make normal o 
unusual progress. But if we wish to evaluate the actual] 
progress that can or should be made by a pupil, a class, or a 
school, the native mental endowment of such an individual 
or group must in all justice be taken into account. In no 
other way can we determine what legitimately ought to be 
expected or demanded from a given individual or group. 
This is the true pedagogical standard, showing what can| 
and ought to be achieved by a given individual or group, 
and should be used by every teacher or superintendent! 
who desires to conserve and cultivate the talents of all his 
pupils in an economical and efficient way.

CHAPTER XVI 
VALUE AND USES OF INTELLIGENT TESTS AND 
THE MENTAL SURVEY 
Tuus far in this discussion we have merely tried to 
estate the more important facts and to point out some of 
he readjustments which should be made in our educa- 
ional theories and practices better to adapt the work of 
ur colleges and schools to the mental abilities, interests, 
nd vocational needs of the individuals who are being edu- 
ated. We shall now point out as clearly and specifically 
s$ we can some of the ways in which intelligence tests and 
ental surveys may be helpful in making these adap- 
ations, or used in helping us to solve some of the more 
mportant practical problems which modern educators 
nd social workers meet. 
Reliable intelligence tests and systematic mental surveys 
ay be used in many ways, of which the following are, 
erhaps, the most important : 
(1) To make individual diagnoses for purposes of grade 
lassification and educational guidance: (a) locating the 
ost brilliant, dull, and average individuals belonging to ° 
ny class, grade, school, or group; (b) prognosticating 
heir probable success in school and life; (c) determining 
hat might reasonably be expected from them in the way

-P-A-G-E-350
  332 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
of school achievement; and (d) making an educationa 
diagnosis to determine what ought to be done for individu 
als who possess such different grades of intelligence. 
(2) To make group comparisons for the purpose o 
determining and studying class, grade, school, and com 
munity differences : (a) comparing the intellectual capacity 
of different sections or classes in a given school grade 
(b) comparing the intellectual capacity of the raw humaz 
material in different schools; (c) studying and determin 
ing the general intellectual level of the pupil material fo: 
an entire school system or community. 
(3) To evaluate and measure the school accomplish 
ment of a pupil, class, grade, school, or school system in the 
light of their intellectual capacity. 
(4) To determine the success which a particular schoo 
or school system has attained in adapting its organizatior 
and work to the mental inequalities of its students, by 
comparing their intelligence scores with the progress mad¢ 
in school. eh 
(5) To make social and community surveys; (a) for the 
purpose of ascertaining the nature and value of the humar 
resources of a community or state; (b) to locate and study 
moral delinquents for purposes of special educational o1 
legal treatment, and (ce) to locate the feebleminded fot 
special study and educational treatment. A mental sur. 
vey, if continued over a period of three or four years 
would reveal as nothing else could the true character of 
the human resources of the state —our most valuable 
asset. 
(6) To make industrial surveys for the purpose of con-
-P-A-G-E-351
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 333 
serving more fully the human resources and talents in 
business and industry, by placing each worker more nearly 
at the right job, or adjusting his occupation to his intellec- 
tual interests and mental strength. 
Space will not permit us to give more than a brief de- 
scription of each of these uses, but it is hoped that even 
such an account may prove helpful to educators and social 
workers interested in a more economic and efficient so- 
lution of the problems discussed. 
1. Making individual diagnosis for grade classifica- 
tion and educational guidance. 
(a) Locating the brightest pupils in any class, grade, 
school, or group, for special educational treatment. 'The 
ways in which a mental survey may be used to lqcate any 
superior group of individuals for special educational treat- 
ment have already been pointed out. (See Chapter IV, 
pp. 42-45.) By the use of reliable intelligence tests the 
most superior individuals in any class, grade, school, or 
group may be located and arrangements made for the kind 
of educational treatment that is best suited to their in- 
tellectual interests and capacities. Group intelligence 
tests are available which may be given to pupils in any 
school grade, or to college students or adults, and to a. 
class of 25 or 300 at a time. These willenable any teacher 
to determine in from 25 to 45 minutes which individuals 
in the group possess the highest or lowest grades of in- 
telligence, as well as to locate specific groups of individuals 
ranking between the highest and lowest divisions of the 
total group. When mental age and grade norms have 
been established the value of these various grades of in-
-P-A-G-E-352
334 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
  telligence may be determined and a more economic and 
profitable educational treatment prescribed for these 
various groups. 
(b) Prognosticating school success. Intelligence tests 
and mental surveys are also of special value for deter- 
mining the probable school success which a particular 
student, class, grade, or group may attain. The ability 
to learn, as revealed by a reliable intelligence test, is the 
best single criterion we have for determining what may 
reasonably be expected in the way of school attainment 
from an individual or group of individuals. This measure 
may, therefore, be used, with certain restrictions, as a 
basis for the classification and promotion of pupils in school 
in the following ways: (1) The brightest individuals in 
any class may be doubly promoted or allowed to skip a 
half or whole grade, or even put in the school grade where 
their intelligence scores indicate that they belong. 
(2) They may be put in a special opportunity class, with 
pupils from other grades or buildings, where they can be 
given special educational treatment adapted to their su- 
perior ability. This would enable a teacher not merely 
to allow such superior individuals to finish the work of 
the ordinary course as rapidly as possible but would pro- 
vide an opportunity for experimenting with the course of 
study and the type of instruction best adapted to the 
needs of such superior pupils. Less detailed work, less drill, 
and fewer reviews are doubtless necessary for such superior 
students. In fact, there is every reasonto believe that both 
the course of study and type of instruction should be 
sharply differentiated for a class of such individuals.
-P-A-G-E-353
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 3385 
3) The pupils of a given grade or school may also be 
‘ouped into sections or classes on the basis of mental 
trength as determined by the mental survey, and- the 
hole matter of their instruction put on a more economi- 
al and efficient basis. (4) The mentally deficient indi- 
iduals in a class or school may be readily located and 
egregated for special educational treatment. (5) Mental 
ests are also helpful as an aid to promotion. They show 
hether or not a given pupil has the ability to do the work 
f the next higher grade because they show what may rea- 
onably be expected from doubtful students.' (6) Intelli- 
lzence tests also indicate the causes of school failure and 
assist in placing children who come from other systems, or 
rom a country to a city school. Children from other 
schools and states are often wrongly placed in the new 
system, being usually assigned to a lower grade than their 
ability and past training really warrant. Intelligence 
tests help to make a proper adjustment. 
Two years ago in a certain Indiana school system near 
a large cantonment the superintendent had the task of 
grading 600 children who came from every section of the 
United States. Inadequate records, different standards, 
the different courses of study and textbooks which had 
been used and the fact that the entire job of classification 
had to be done in a few days at the opening of school made 
his task extremely difficult. Appeal was made to intelli- 
gence tests and to the age and grade norms which had been 
previously established for his system on the Indiana Uni- 
1 For a discussion of the limitations of group intelligence tests, see 
Chapter XIV, section 9.

    versity Group Intelligence Scale. As a result the pupils 
were soon correctly classified for effective work. 
(ec) Vocational guidance. As has already been shown. 
intelligence tests and the results from systematic menta 
surveys may be used to prognosticate not only the kin 
of success which a given individual may attain in school 
but also in life. By means of reliable intelligence tests w 
may ascertain the occupations or lines of work in which a: 
individual with a given grade of intelligence might be ex- 
pected to succeed and the callings that are clearly unsuited 
to his mental strength. Intelligence tests may therefore 
be made a first step in the successful vocational and edu- 
cational guidance of youth and are needed far down in the 
grades, contrary to the opinion of most educators. 
As far down as the fourth and fifth grade pupils begin 
to drop out of school. For these individuals some factual 
basis is needed to direct not only their future education, 
but their choice of occupation, because it becomes 
necessary to do both as soon as it is apparent that they 
can no longer profit by the traditional school course. They 
must at this time, if ever, be given educational work 
adapted to their mental capacity and future vocational! 
needs. This is absolutely necessary if their education is 
to be directed in ways that will be most interesting and 
helpful to them. They cannot profit by or become in- 
terested in the traditional school course because they lack 
the native mental ability to do the work. 
We can only speculate on the amount of social waste 
which occurs from the fact that such individuals have not 
been directed towards or trained for the lines of work    
      
                                      
-P-A-G-E-355
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 337 
adapted to their mental capacities and interests.!_ Because 
lof inadequate vocational guidance many men and women 
lare to-day engaged in occupations far beneath the level of 
their intellectual ability. Others are attempting work 
too complex for their mental strength. Both are made 
unhappy and inefficient because of the ill-adjustment. 
[And a bad matter is made worse when young people are 
trained in our professional and vocational schools for life 
careers wholly unsuited to their native mental strength. 
Systematic mental surveys would do much to correct 
such social wastes. If intelligence tests were given to 
workers now engaged in the various standard occupations, 
we would obtain intelligence norms which would show the 
grade of intelligence that the workers in each important 
field of work actually possess and, therefore, the intelli- 
gence levels that are necessary for successful work in the 
standard occupations. Such norms would at least give 
us a starting point for effective vocational and educational 
guidance of youth. 
(d) Educational diagnosis and direction. But a mat- 
ter which is just as important as directing an individual 
towards the work in life which he is best able to do, is to 
1 This situation is made worse by the well-meaning but misdirected 
efforts of many of our child welfare enthusiasts who busy themselves by 
getting laws enacted in the different states which force these unfortunate 
and mentally deficient individuals to continue in school until they are 
16 years of age. No provisions are made to adapt the course of study to 
their capacities or vocational needs. The only hope in such misguided 
procedure lies in the fact that such laws may in time force school author- 
ities to adjust their school work to the intellectual capacities and needs of 
those who are thus forced into the school, but who can never succeed with 
or profit by the regular academic course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
    338 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
prepare him by education or training to do that work ii 
the most economical and efficient way possible. We must. 
therefore, learn to determine what, in an educational way. 
should be done for the individuals belonging to each parti 
ular mental class or group. An intelligence score is th 
best aid which a teacher or parent can have, who mus 
make such a diagnosis or give to an individual the kind o! 
educational guidance which he ought to have. A reliabl 
intelligence rating, more than any other one thing, show 
what a given individual can do and what he cannot do| 
successfully, and what direction a given student’s educa- 
tion should take. By indicating what may be expected 
from an individual, we secure help in predicting what ought} 
to be done for him or any group of individuals who vary 
so tremendously in native mental capacity. 
The need for such educational and vocational guidance 
is apparent to all. It cannot be given to the young peo- 
ple in our colleges and schools without the use of intelli- 
gence tests or systematic mental surveys. Such direction 
or guidance should be given while these young people are 
still being trained for the duties of life. When we reflect 
that such intelligence tests may be given to an entire 
class of 25 to 400 individuals in 30 or 45 minutes and the 
results scored as quickly as a teacher can grade the re- 
sults of the ordinary school examination, it is difficult to 
see why such mental tests are not given more often as 
regular examinations by the school. 
(e) Determining the causes of failure in school. In- 
telligence tests are also an aid in ascertaining the causes of 
failure in school, because they enable a teacher to deter-
-P-A-G-E-357
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 339 
mine whether such failure is caused by the absence of 
intellectual capacity or by poor teaching and inability on 
her part to reach and interest her students in the work. 
2. Determining the success or adjustment of a school 
to these individual differences. The best, and so far as 
the writer knows, the only systematic way in which 
a superintendent can determine the extent to which 
his schools and teachers are succeeding in adapting 
themselves to individual differences in the native 
mental endowment of their pupils, is by means of intelli- 
gence tests or mental surveys. This may be done by 
determining the grade of intelligence which the pupils pos- 
sess who have actually been accelerated or retarded by the 
school. Such questions as the following would naturally 
arise while making such comparisons. How does the 
intellectual ability of those accelerated by the school com- 
pare with that of the group which has been retarded or 
only normally promoted? Are some pupils advanced 
faster than their mental ability seems to warrant and others 
held back who really should have been advanced? Are 
the brightest pupils advanced as rapidly as their mental 
ability warrants? Are the duller students promoted 
along with the brightest or even ahead of some of them? 
If so, what is wrong ? 
A mental survey is therefore needed to show how well a 
school is adjusting itself in organization and work to the 
individual differences and needs of its students. If the 
brightest students are not making good grades on their 
school work, the reasons for such failure should be deter- 
mined and the proper adjustments made. A careful study
-P-A-G-E-358
    
       
                                                                               340 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
   should also bé made of the “over-ageness and under- 
ageness’’ of each pupil in the school. In schools where 
careful and thorough mental surveys have been made we 
regularly find that the brightest pupils have not been ad- 
vanced by the school as rapidly as their mental ability 
seems to warrant, while the dullest pupils have, as a rule, 
been advanced more rapidly than their mental ability 
indicates that they should be. That is to say, it is the 
brightest children who are really retarded, because they 
are found to be from one to three years behind the grade to 
which their mental ability indicates that they should 
belong. 
Intelligence tests and mental surveys will, therefore, 
enable school authorities to approach the study of re- 
tardation from an entirely new and _ scientific angle. 
Viewed in the light of the individual differences in mental 
endowment which are known to exist, the problem of re- 
tardation presents an entirely different situation from 
what is usually supposed to exist. The problem needs to 
be approached from the angle of what may reasonably be 
expected from individuals who possess given grades of 
native mental endowment, rather than by judging each 
pupil’s school standing on the basis of mere chronological 
age or by standards which disregard the native mental 
ability of the students whose work is being evaluated. 
3. Making group diagnoses to determine mental 
differences between classes, grades, schools, and 
groups. Intelligence tests may also be used to determine 
and study class, grade, school, and community differences. 
It has been found that marked differences exist between
-P-A-G-E-359
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 341 
he intellectual capacity of children who belong to different 
ections of the same school grade, or who attend different 
uildings in the same city, or between children living in 
ifferent cities or in different sections of a county or state. 
Reliable group scales of intelligence will enable a super- 
ntendent first of all to compare the intellectual capacity 
f different sections or classes in the same school grade and 
‘0 to determine what may reasonably be expected from a 
iven class or grade. In this manner the work of a teacher 
ay be properly evaluated. Without such intelligence 
ecords all sections or classes must be judged by the same 
standard. This, in the light of the group differences 
hich have been shown to exist, would be a manifestly 
njust and inaccurate procedure. Such tests may also be 
sed to study the intellectual capacity of the human 
aterial found in different schools belonging to the same 
system or for determining the general level of intelligence 
f the pupil material for an entire community. 
In this way any superintendent with the aid of a group 
scale for measuring intelligence may obtain a real factual 
asis for comparing the accomplishment of his own system 
ith that of any other system; for evaluating the work of 
lany particular teacher or the results obtained by the teach- 
lers in different buildings, etc. We no longer should eval- 
ate school accomplishment for a particular class or section, 
r the success of teachers in a particular building, or the 
ork of an entire school system by mere objective stand- 
lards of achievement which do not take into account the 
ental capacity or “learning index” of the pupils con- 
cerned. The actual school accomplishment should be
-P-A-G-E-360
342 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
judged in terms of what is possible, as well as what i 
desirable. 
Intelligence tests may, therefore, become not merely a: 
instrument in the hands of a teacher or superintendent fo 
making proper adjustments to such class, grade, school, an 
community differences as actually exist, but a means fo 
the just evaluation and proper measurement of the r 
sults of their work. 
4. Intelligence tests needed to evaluate and measure| 
school accomplishment. Intelligence tests and mental] 
surveys are necessary for determining the type and amoun 
of progress which a given pupil, class, grade, school, or| 
school system should make. The intelligence score in- 
dicates the school progress which such an individual or| 
group should be expected to make and so is necessary in 
evaluating the progress in learning which is actually taking} 
place. In evaluating the work of a teacher or measuring] 
the actual success which has been achieved we must 
combine the results obtained from achievement tests with 
the results obtained from mental surveys and learn to 
judge what 7s, in the light of what may be, or what ought! 
to be expected from a pupil or class possessing the type' 
and grade of intellectual ability revealed by the mental 
tests. It is not only unjust but pedagogically inaccurate 
or wrong to judge the results obtained by a pupil or 
teacher without regard to what can and therefore, ought 
~ to be achieved. Intelligence tests and the mental survey 
may become a means for the proper evaluation and meas- 
urement of school accomplishment, and a technique or 
method should be worked out which will enable teachers

                      VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 343 
      nd superintendents to use achievement tests and intelli- 
ence tests together and so measure the results of teaching 
n the light of what can and ought to be accomplished.! 
5. Making social and community surveys. Intelligence 
ests and the mental survey may also be used to deter- 
ine the character and value of the human resources of a 
iven community or state. By means of mental surveys 
we may take stock, as it were, of the human resources of 
lany community. Such a survey might be made in the 
public schools because this would probably give a true 
picture of the intellectual level of the adult population 
lof the community. It might also be made a means for 
locating actual and prospective moral delinquents and 
feebleminded, if the special cases so differentiated were 
given an individual examination of a more searching and 
exact character. Such social and community surveys 
might be used : (a) to locate for purposes of further study 
and special social and educational treatment prospective 
and actual moral delinquents; (b) to locate the feeble- 
minded for further study and special educational treat- 
ment; and (c) to make an inventory of the human re- 
sources of a community or state. The first two uses 
named should be more fully described. 
(a) Location and treatment of moral delinquents. Intel- 
ligence tests are especially valuable for determining what 
sort of re-education should take place in our treatment 
of moral delinquents. Crime is often the result of mental 
          
1 Such a program of research has been undertaken in our own laboratory, 
School achievement tests are being developed which may be readily 
combined in this way with group intelligence tests.
-P-A-G-E-362

                      deficiency. Intelligence tests would indicate the genera! 
level of intelligence of this delinquent group and woul 
therefore show to some extent the source of the mora 
delinquency. They would at least indicate the sort o: 
re-education that was needed for this group of adults] 
If systematic mental surveys were given in the schools 
we would be able to isolate for special case study man; 
of the individuals who would later drift into this criminal 
class, and by making a special study of these individual 
the problem of dealing with this delinquent class woul 
be met at the source and by means of special educationa 
treatment and training in habit formation, which woul: 
naturally be injected into our treatment of these individ. 
uals, we might prevent the development of those viciou: 
innate tendencies which make this class a menace to 
society. We would at least secure a real factual basis fo: 
dealing with the problem at its inception. 
(b) Location and treatment of the feebleminded. One of 
the most important functions of the mental survey is to 
locate those who possess the most inferior grades of intelli- 
gence found among the individuals of any unselected 
group. By means of group intelligence tests these in- 
dividuals may be located in the same manner that those 
possessing the most superior grades of intelligence for their 
age were identified. By further individual examinations 
the degree of mental deficiency may be accurately de- 
termined and a true basis established for educational 
treatment. This would give to the superintendent a 
proper basis for determining both the content and method 
which should be employed in their education.    
       
          
-P-A-G-E-363
VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 345 
  Intelligence tests not only show the numerous grades of 
intelligence actually found in any unselected group of 
individuals, but show that those who fall below a certain 
level will never be able to succeed with certain types of 
school work no matter how much or long they try. These 
should be segregated at once for special educational treat- 
ment. The feebleminded and certain grades of morons 
should be segregated early not merely for special educa- 
tional treatment, but also to be protected from the com- 
petition of normal individuals and from each other. By 
such prophylactic measures we shall not merely serve 
best this unfortunate class, but also protect society from 
the crime, pauperism, and industrial inefficiency which 
can be traced directly to this class of individuals and to 
the fact that they have not been properly trained or taken 
care of. Intelligence tests and the mental survey are the 
only means by which these individuals may be surely 
identified and the degree of defectiveness ascertained. 
6. Conserving human talents and capacities in busi- 
ness and industry. Intelligence tests and mental surveys 
may also be made a means for the conservation of talents 
and human capacities in the fields of business and industry. 
We can only speculate concerning the amount of social 
waste which results from the fact that the right individual 
is not in the right occupation. Much social waste could 
be prevented if employment managers would only try to 
fit workers to the types of work that are adapted to 
their intellectual capacities. 
For this, intelligence tests are necessary and if followed 
up by appropriate vocational and trade tests which de-  
-P-A-G-E-364

346 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
termine the special mental characteristics and _ skills 
required for different lines of work, the employees in any 
business or industry could in time be placed more nearly 
in the right vocation than would ever happen as a result 
of mere chance, or from the operation of the law of the 
survival of the fittest in different lines of work. And we 
have said nothing fabout the enormous gain that would 
come from the change in attitude which would take place 
in the minds of workers if in some manner they could 
always be connected up with a job in harmony with their 
mental capacity and intellectual interests. 
7. The mental survey and social service. Lastly, 
intelligence tests are an aid to social workers because 
they may help them to understand that great body of indi- 
viduals who are objects of public charity. Pauperism 
and vagrancy, even more than crime, result from inferior 
mental capacity. They are chiefly due to the fact 
that the individual is unable to compete in the modern 
economic and industrial world with individuals of average 
or better grades of intelligence. These less fortunately 
endowed individuals do not need to be clothed and fed at 
public expense so much as they need to be protected from 
normal competition, by training them for some necessary 
occupation, which is adapted to their intellectual capacity, 
and one which will enable them to become self-supporting 
and happy because they have been helped to help themselves. 
The mental survey may be employed in devising methods 
of dealing scientifically with this group of individuals: 
(1) by finding tasks which are adapted to their mental 
strength. It will help to determine what in the way of 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  VALUE AND USES OF MENTAL TESTS 347 
aining and dependability may reasonably be expected 
‘om individuals with their grade of intelligence. (2) It 
ay be used to determine which occupations require 
at particular grade of intelligence for successful per- 
mance.

SEARCH IN THE HUMANISTIC SCIENCES 
       
    
     
   
    
     
    
    
   
   1. Need for codperation. For carrying on such sy 
tematic mental surveys of a social and educational nature. 
a program of codperative research should be carefull 
planned and pursued through a period of years. A group o 
specially trained men and women at the universities shoul: 
codperate with select groups of teachers, superintendents, 
and social workers who are in first-hand touch with the prob: 
lems to be solved. For to deal with the problem of edu: 
cation and social betterment in an efficient and economi 
cal way, we must have a more comprehensive and accurat 
knowledge of the facts that pertain to the problems whic 
are to be solved by those whose business it is to chang 
human nature in accordance with our best ideals. Th 
need for such a comprehensive and systematic program o 
research is apparent. We are groping too much in th 
dark with regard to all these important problems and ca: 
never make more rapid progress in their solution than tha 
which results from the use of the trial and error metho 
until we have a more exact knowledge of the pertinen 
facts. A single illustration will make this fact clear. 
We do not yet know what, in an educational way, ma:

                         NEED FOR COOPERATIVE RESEARCH 349 
   easonably be expected from individuals who vary so 
reatly in mental ability as those studied in this investi- 
ation, and we have no practical methods for measuring 
chool progress in the light of the native mental endowment 
f school children. In the field of social service and reform 
e do not know how to prevent crime, how to reform 
iminals, how to conserve child life and health, because we 
lo not have the facts which enable us to act intelligently 
ith regard to the problems in these fields. Much careful 
nd painstaking research is needed before these and other 
mportant problems can be systematically solved. 
Such research must, we believe, be undertaken by the 
niversities working in close codperation with the practical] 
ovkers in the field, so that the searchlight of science may 
e thrown upon their problems and the investigations of 
he specialist at the university sharply directed towards the 
lution of the practical problems which the workers in 
he field are called upon to solve. This is not only possible 
ut highly desirable for reasons which follow. 
2. Value of organized effort in research. It has been 
shown that man’s native mental curiosity, which is chiefly 
responsible for the success of science and the discovery of 
all truth, may be harnessed, as it were, or set to work on a 
program of research which requires the labor of many 
hands and the best efforts of individuals with the most 
diverse capacities and interests. As was so well shown by 
our experience in the World War, practical men and scien- 
tists, representing various fields of research, may be or- 
yanized and set to work upon a program of research that 
will prove immediately helpful for the solution of impor- 
                           
-P-A-G-E-368
   
          350 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS       tant present-day problems in any field. By such codpera: 
tion and concentrated effort results may be obtained fa: 
superior to any that are possible by the use of the mor 
spasmodic scientific procedure, which has been the fashio: 
in every department of science up to the present time. 
This is true for the same reasons that modern business an 
industry have found such codperation and organization 
necessary to achieve the greatest results with the least 
expenditure of time and effort. It needs only to be re- 
membered that in such a program of research the individ- 
ual scientists who venture farthest beyond the bounds of 
the known must be given full freedom for the play of their 
mental curiosity while working on any particular problem 
or in such a definitely limited field. 
3. Part to be played by the university. In any such 
scheme for codperative research the university must play 
the leading réle. It is in the university that the facts must 
be determined which will guide the practical workers in the 
field. The technique for such codperative work and the 
methods of research must be developed by a corps of 
specialists at the university. We need give but a single 
example and may take it from the field of mental measure- 
ments as applied to the problems discussed in the pre- 
ceding chapters. 
Such specialists must devise and verify a method for 
evaluating and measuring school accomplishment. They 
must devise methods which will enable teachers and super- 
intendents to determine the causes of school failure. They 
must devise and verify methods which will enable educa- 
tors and teachers to measure the progress that is made in

all standard forms of acquisition or learning. They must 
show how a “vital index” for school children may be de- 
termined, and used in adapting the work of the school to 
their vital as well as to their intellectual capacity. They 
should determine how best to cultivate such important 
mental abilities as attention, memory, the power of correct 
observation ; and devise and verify methods for the meas- 
urement of persistence, mental attitude, ingenuity, and 
other mental characteristics important for success in 
school and life. 
4, Need for adequate financial support. Such prob- 
lems cannot be solved by the practical workers in the 
field. They must be worked out by a corps of specialists 
at the university, who are supported by state or federal 
appropriations or by special and private foundations, 
sufficient in amount and constant enough in character 
to enable them to formulate and carry to successful com- 
pletion extended programs of research. These specialists 
must also take the lead in directing the work of teachers, 
superintendents, and social workers who are to make 
their contributions by applying the facts so discovered 
and by trying out in their mental and social surveys the 
methods and technique which have been devised by the 
scientists at the university. 
5. Scales and materials now available for making 
such systematic school and community surveys. For 
making such school and community surveys as we have 
suggested in the preceding chapters, reliable methods of 
measurement with appropriate scales for such measure- 
ments have already been developed. A group scale for
-P-A-G-E-370
  352 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
measuring the intelligence of school children, applicabl 
both to the elementary grades and to high school, has bee! 
developed by Drs. S. L. Pressey and L. W. Pressey, Re 
search Assistants in the Department of Psychology a 
Indiana University; and “school attainment’’ tests i 
the fundamental school subjects to be used in conjunctio 
with these intelligence tests for the evaluation of the wor! 
of teachers, classes, or schools are also being developed an 
tested. 
A group point scale of intelligence adapted to measurin; 
the intelligence of pupils in the first three school grade 
and learning or achievement tests devised to evaluate an 
measure the progress made in reading, spelling, and th 
fundamental arithmetical processes to be learned in th 
elementary grades have already been prepared. Thesi 
may be obtained from the Department of Psychology. 
Indiana University, at cost of printing and handling. A 
a matter of fact, the present investigation is only one of 
series of studies that have been undertaken in the field o 
mental measurements at Indiana University. Two re 
search assistants are devoting their entire time to de 
vising methods and technique for the solution of 
important educational and social problems in the field 
of mental measurements as well as giving help to super- 
intendents, teachers, and social workers in the use of the 
materials and methods worked out in our own and other 
laboratories. 
A number of other reliable group intelligence scales are 
also available for making such mental and social surveys. 
Among these should be mentioned the Otis scale, the Hag-
-P-A-G-E-371
  NEED FOR COOPERATIVE RESEARCH 353 
erty scale, the Terman Group scale, the Meyers scale, the 
intner scale, the Dearborn scale, and the National Com- 
ittee scale. Most of these may be obtained from the 
orld Book Co., Yonkers, New York. For detailed in- 
ividual examinations and case study the Stanford Re- 
ision of the Binet scale and the Kuhlmann intelligence 
ests are on the whole the best. 
A similar service to that described above, for mental 
esting, is being organized by our laboratory for industry 
nd business. That is to say, psychological methods are 
eing devised and applied to the more important hwman 
roblems encountered in these fields. A similar program 
‘or codperative research might be planned for a number of 
ther fields of human activity where psychological laws 
land principles are an important factor in conditioning 
human affairs. This is particularly true in the field of 
child welfare work. 
6. New science of human engineering possible. In 
some such manner a real science of human engineering may 
be developed which would have for its goal the betterment 
of the race and the discovery of such facts as would enable 
us to cultivate and improve all of man’s abilities. In the 
past, scientific endeavor has been directed chiefly towards 
the discovery of facts that would enable us to understand 
and improve the physical conditions under which man 
must live and work. It is time that we directed our scien- 
tific work towards problems whose solution would enable 
us to improve the race itself. If comprehensive methods 
of research in this field were wisely planned and systemat- 
ically carried out, we would soon be able to deal on a factual 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
     | 
354 INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS 
basis with many things about which we can at present only 
_ dream, because science would be harnessed, as it were, 
and made to do service in showing us how human nature 
itself might be changed in accordance with the highest 
ideals we hold concerning the possibilities and purposes of 
human life in the world. 
7. General conclusion. What is needed to-day is more 
and better trained workers for such programs of codpera- 
tive research as have been suggested above, and adequate 
financial support to carry on the work. The best things 
in the world have not yet happened. The best history 
remains to be written. Science, particularly the human- 
istic branch, is only in its infancy. The man who 
thinks that the most important discoveries have been 
made is intellectually blind. What is needed is a clearer 
vision of what can and ought to be done by means of 
systematic research; a greater willingness on the part of 
those who have been specially trained for scientific work 
to codperate among themselves and with the practical 
workers in the field on important programs of research; 
and sufficient financial support to stimulate the best 
young men and women in each state to elect and prepare 
for a scientific career. 
If this study of the intelligence of high school seniors has 
made only a slight contribution to that body of facts 
which, when fully determined, will enable us better to con- 
serve our human resources and talents; or if it will but 
help to stimulate those who can and should codperate in 
such humanistic research; or if it will suggest to those 
who have the means to support or endow such scientific

work, that such support constitutes one of the greatest 
opportunities for permanent social service that is to be 
found in the world, the fondest hopes of the writer will 
have been realized.

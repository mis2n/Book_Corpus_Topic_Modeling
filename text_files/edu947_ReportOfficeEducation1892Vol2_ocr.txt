DOCUMENTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL

and the Art of Teaching in the University of Michigan. 
ContTENTS.—Introductory remarks—I. Massachusetts legislation—II. Plymouth legisla- 
tion—III. Connecticut legislation—IV. The common-school fund of Connecticut— 
V. Pennsylvania legislation—VI. Congressional land grants for common schools and 
universities—VII. Congressional grants of land and money for colleges of agricul-

tutions relating to education. 
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 
Documents are the basis of history. Dr. E. A, Freeman has very 
justly remarked “that the most ingenious and eloquent of modern his- 
torical discourses can after all be nothing more than a comment on a 
text.” Even teachers who do not primarily deal with original mate- 
rials find it necessary constantly to resort to such materials for the 
illustration and enforcement of historic truth, and often for its dis- 
covery. 
No sooner had the compiler of this chapter begun to teach, or even 
to study, American educational history, than he was embarrassed by 
the lack of suitable documents with which to carry on his work prop- 
erly. For reasons that are only too obvious, the memorials of educa- 
tion are less accessible than the memorials of war and politics. The 
limited number of documents here brought together were found seat. 
tered through many volumes, even counting the older collections that 
have been consulted. This collection originated, therefore, in the 
practical needs of the compiler’s own study and lecture room. As 
measured by a compilation that might be made, it is meager indeed; 
but it is believed that students and teachers of the subject, also jour- 
nalists, statesmen, and many others will find it a useful repository of 
materials. :

While the sources from which the documents were immediately 
drawn are given in the pages following, it is proper to express obliga- 
tions to Dr. Barnard, Dr. Wickersham, Dr. Goode, and Mr. Poore. 
Dr. F. B. Hough’s compilation, Constitutional Provisions Relating to 
Education, Literature, and Science in the Several States of the Amer- 
ican Union, ete., published by the Bureau as a Circular of Information, 
No. VII, 1875, has been very helpful. It has not been thought desir- 
able, however, to include all of the material contained in that circular 
in this chapter. Still all the constitutional provisions relating to the 
subject ever adopted down to date will here be found. Such of Dr. 
Hough’s notes as have been retained are marked “H.” It is proper 
also to remark that the compiler has made free use of a previous com- 
pilation of his own—Topics in the Educational History of the United 
States—pvinted for private circulation. 
I. MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATION, 1636-1789. 
1, Harvard COLLEGE: Grant of 1636, grant of 1637, grant of 1638-39, grant of 1640; 
remarks by President Quincy; act establishing the overseers of Harvard College, 1642; 
character of the president and fellows of Harvard College, 1650; appendix to charter, 
1657; final resolve of the provincial legislature declaring the charter of 1650 not 
repealed, 1707; provisions of the charter of Massachusetts Bay relating to schools 
and colleges, 1691. 
2. Common ScHoois: Ordinance of 1642; ordinance of 1647; quotation from Lord 
Macaulay; declaration of the general court, 1652; order of the general court, 1654; 
order by the general court 1671; order of the general court 1683; act of 1789; quota- 
tions from Dr. George B. Emerson, John Adams, and President Dwight. 
All the legislation in relation to Harvard College down to 1780 is 
here brought together in chronological order. All other school legis- 
Jation enacted by the general court down to 1683, or at least all that I 
have found, is also given. By that time the common-school system 
was legislatively well developed, and it was not thereafter practically 
changed until the act of 1789, which was based on the constitution of 
1780. The educational provisions of the colonial charter of 1691 are 
also given, for a reason that will appear in the accompanying anno- 
tation. 
1. HARVARD COLLEGE. 
GRANTS OF THE GENERAL COURT, 
(At a court, holden September 8, 1636, and continued by adjournment to the 28th of the 8th month 
(October, 1636).] 
The court agreed to give £400 toward a school or college, whereof £200 to be 
paid next year and £200 when the work is finished, and the next court to appoint 
where and what building.’ 
[At a general court, holden at Newtown, on the 2d of the 9th month (November 2), 1637.] 
The college ordered to be at Newtown.” 
For the college, the governor, Mr. Winthrop, the deputy, Mr. Dudley, the treas- 
urer, Mr. Bellingham, Mr. Humphrey, Mr. Herlakenden, Mr. Stoughten, Mr. Cotton,

Mr, Wilson, Mr. Davenport, Mr. Welde, Mr. Shepard, and Mr. Peters; these, or the 
greatcr part of them, whereof Mr. Winthrop, Mr. Dudley, or Mr. Bellingham to be 
always one, to take order for a college at Newtown.! 
[At a court, holden the 13th of the Ist month (March), 1638-89.] 
It is ordered, that the college agreed upon formerly to be built at 
Cambridge shall be called Harvard College.” 
[Ata court, holden the 7th day of the 8th month (Gctober), 1640.] 
The ferry between Boston and Charlestown is granted to the college.’ 
Concerning the change of the name of Newtown to Cambridge and 
the naming of the college President Quincy writes: 
The name of the town was soon after changed to Cambridge, a grateful tribute to 
the transatlantic literary parent of many of the first emigrants and indicative of 
the high destiny to which they intended the institution should aspire. 
In the year 1638, while they were only contemplating its commencement, John 
Harvard, a dissenting clergyman of England, resident at Charlestown, died, and 
bequeathed one-half of his whole property and his entire library to the institution. 
An instance of benevolence thus striking and timely, proceeding from one who had. 
been scarcely a year in the country, was accepted by our fathers as an omen of 
Divine favor. With prayer and thanksgiving they immediately commenced the 
seminary, and conferred upon it the name of Harvard.* 
THE ACT ESTABLISHING THE OVERSEERS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 
[Ata general court, held in Boston in the year 1642.] 
Whereas throngh the good hand of God upon us there is a college founded in Cam- 
bridge, in the county of Middlesex, called Harvard College, for the encouragement 
whereof this court has given the sum of four hundred pounds, and also the revenue 
of the ferry betwixt Charlestown and Boston, and that the well ordering and manag- 
ing of the said college is of great concernment: 
It is therefore ordered by this court, and the authority thereof, That the governor and 
deputy governor for the time being, and all the magistrates of this jurisdiction, 
together with the teaching elders of the six next adjoining towns, viz, Cambridge, 
Watertown, Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury, and Dorchester, and the president of the 
said college for the time being, shall, from time to time, have full power and authority 
to make and establish all such orders, statutes, and constitutions as they shall see 
necessary for the instituting, guiding, and furthering of the said college, and the 
several members thereof, from time to time, in piety, morality, and learning; as also 
to dispose, order, and manage, to the use and behoof of the said college and the 
members thereof, all gifts, legacies, bequeaths, revenues, lands, and donations, as 
either have been, are, or shall be, conferred, bestowed, or any ways shall fall or 
come to the said college. 
And whereas it may come to pass that many of the said magistrates and said 
elders may be absent, or otherwise employed about other weighty affairs, when the 
said college may need their present help and counsel; 
It is therefore ordered, That the greater number of said magistrates and elders 
which shall be present, with the president, shall have the power of the whole: 
Provided, That if any constitution, order, or orders by them made shall be found 
hurtful to the said college, or the members thereof, or to the weal public, then, 
upon appeal of the party or parties grieved unto the company of overseers first

mentioned, they shall repeal the said order or orders, if they shall see cause, at their 
next meeting, or stand accountable thereof to the next general court.! 
CHARTER OF THE PRESIDENT AND FELLOWS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 
[Under the seal of the colony of Massachusetts Bay. and bearing date May 3, A. D.1650.] 
Whereas through the good hand of God many well-devoted persons have been, 
and daily are, moved and stirred up to give and bestow sundry gifts, legacies, lands, 
and revenues for the advancement 6f all good literature, arts, and sciences in Har- 
vard College, in Cambridge, in the county of Middlesex, and to the maintenance of 
the president and fellows, and for all accommodations of buildings, and all other 
necessary provisions that may conduce to the education of the English and Indian 
youth of this country in knowledge and godliness: 
It is therefore ordered and enacted by this court, and the authority thereof, That for the 
furthering of the good work, and for the purposes aforesaid from henceforth, that the 
said college in Cambridge, in Middlesex, in New England, shall be a corporation, 
consisting of seven persons, to wit, a president, five fellows, and a treasurer or bur- 
sar; and that Henry Dunster shall be the first president; Samuel Mather, Samuel 
Danforth, masters of art; Jonathan Mitchell, Comfort Starr, and Samuel Eaton, 
bachelors of art, shall be the five fellows; and Thomas Danforth to be present 
treasurer, all of whom being inhabitants in the bay, and shall be the first seven per- 
sons of which the said corporation shall consist; and that the said seven persons, or 
the greater number of them, procuring the presence of the overseers of the college, 
and by their counsel and consent, shall have power, and are hereby authorized, at 
any time or times, to elect a new president, fellows, or treasurer, so oft, and from 
time to time, as any of the said persons shall die or be removed; which said presi- 
dent and fellows, for the time being, shall forever hereafter, in name and fact, be one 
body politic and corporate in law, to all intents and purposes; and shall have per- 
petual succession; and shall be called by the name of President and Fellows of Har- 
vard College, and shall, from time to time, be eligible as aforesaid, and by that name 
they, and their successors, shall and may purchase and acquire to themselves, or take 
and receive upon free gift and donation, any lands, tenements, or hereditaments 
within this jurisdiction of the Massachusetts, not exceeding five hundred pounds 
per annum, and any goods and sums of money whatsoever, to the use and behoof of 
the said president, fellows, and scholars of the said college; and also may sue and 
plead, or be sued and impleaded by the name aforesaid in all courts and places of 
judicature within the jurisdiction aforesaid. 
And that the said president, with any three of the fellows, shall have power, and 
are hereby authorized, when they shall think fit, to make and appoint a common seal 
for the use of the said corporation. And the president and fellows, or major part 
of them, from time to time, may meet and choose such officers and servants for the 
college, and make such allowance to them, and them also to remove, and after death 
or removal to choose such others, and to make, from time to time, such orders and 
by-laws for the better ordering and carrying on the work of the college as they 
shall think fit; provided, the said orders be allowed by the overseers. And also, 
that the president and fellows, or any major part of them, with the treasurer, shall 
have power to make conclusive bargains for lands and tenements to be purchased 
by the said corporation for valuable consideration. 
And for the better ordering of the government of the said college and corporation— 
Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the president and three more of the 
fellows shall and may, from time to time, upon due warning or notice given by the 
president to the rest, hold a meeting for the debating and concluding of affairs con- 
cerning the profits and revenues of any lands and disposing of their goods (provided 
that all the said disposings be according to the wills of the donors), and for direc-

tion in all emergent occasions, execution of all orders and by-laws, and for the 
procuring of a general meeting of all the overseers and society in great and difficult 
cases, and in cases of nonagreement; in all which cases aforesaid the conclusion 
shall be made by the major part (the said president having a casting voice), the over- 
secrs consenting thereto, and that all tho aforesaid transactions shall tend to and for 
the use and behoof of the president, fellows, scholars, and officers of the said college, 
and for all accommodations of buildings, books, and all other necessary provisions 
and furnitures as may be for the advancement and education of youth in all manner 
of good literature, arts, and sciences. 
And further be it ordered by this court and the authority thereof, That all the lands, 
tenements, hereditaments, houses, or revenues, within this jurisdiction, to the afore- 
said president or college appertaining, not exceeding the value of five hundred 
‘ pounds per annum, shall from henceforth be freed from all civil impositions, taxes 
and rates; all goods to the said corporation, or to any scholars thereof appertaining 
shall bo exempted from all manner of toll, customs, and excise whatsoever. And 
that the said president, fellows, and scholars, together with the servants and other 
necessary officers to the said president or college appertaining, not exceeding ten, 
viz, three to the president and seven to the college belonging, shall be exempted 
from all personal civil offices, military exercises or services, watchings, and ward- 
ings; and such of their estates, not exceeding one hundred pounds a man, shall be 
free from all county taxes or rates whatsoever, and no other. 
In witness thereof the court hath caused the seal of the colony to be hereunto 
affixed. 
Dated the one and thirtieth day of the third month called May, anno 1650. 
[t. 8.] THOMAS DUDLEY, Governor.' 
[An appendix to the college charter, granted by an act of the general court of the colony, passed 
anno 1657.] 
At a general court, held at Boston the 14th of October, 1657. 
In answer to certain proposals presented to this court by the overseers of Harvard 
College as an appendix to the college charter, it is ordered, The corporation shall 
have power, from time to time, to make such orders and by-laws for the better 
ordering and carrying on of the work of the college as they shall see cause, without 
dependence upon the consent of the overseers foregoing: Provided always, That the 
corporation shall be responsible unto, and those orders and by-laws shall be alterable 
by, the overseers according to their discretion. 
And when the corporation shall hold a meeting for agreeing with college servants; 
for making of orders and by-laws; for debatimg and concluding of affairs concern- 
ing the profits and revenues of any lands or gifts and the disposing thereof (pro- 
vided that all the said disposals be according to the wills of the donors); for 
managing of all emergent occasions; for the procuring of a general meeting of the 
overseers and society in great and difficult cases and in case of nonagreement; and 
to all other college affairs to them pertaining—in all these cases the conclusion 
shall be valid, being made by the major part of the corporation, the president hay- 
ing acasting vote: Provided always, That in these things also they be responsible to 
the overseers as aforesaid. 
And in case the corporation shall see cause to call a meeting of the overseers, or 
the overseers shall think good to meet of themselves, it. shall be sufficient unto the 
validity of college acts that notice be given to the overseers in the six towns men- 
tioned in the printed law anno 1642, when the rest of the overseers, by reason of 
the remoteness of their inhabitants, can not conveniently be acquainted therewith.?

Anno Regni Anne Regine Sexto. 
Ata great or general court or assembly for Her Majesty’s province of the Massa-) 
chusetts Bay, in New England, begun and held at Boston, upon Wednesday, the 
twenty-eighth of May, 1707, and continued by several prorogations unto Wednesday, 
the twenty-ninth of October following, being the third session. : 
In council, Thursday, December 4, 1707. 
The governor and council, having accepted and approved the choice made by tlte 
fellows of Harvard College, in Cambridge, of Mr. John Leverett to be present 
president of the said college, to fill up that vacancy— : 
Propose that the house of representatives consider of and grant a suitable salary, 
to be paid to the said president annually out of the public treasury, for his encour- 
agement and support during his continuance in said office, residing at Cambridge, 
and discharging the proper duties to a president belonging, and entirely Coys 
himself to that service. 
And inasmuch as the first foundation and establishment of that house and the 
government thereof hath its original from an act of the general court, made and 
passed in the year one thousand six hundred and fifty, which has not been repealed 
or nulled; 
The president and fellows of the said college are directed from time to time to regu- 
late themselves according to the rules of the constitution by the said act prescribed, 
and to exercise the powers and authority thereby granted for the government of that 
house and support thereof.

Consented to. 
J. Dupiey.! 
The following provisions, found in the provincial charter of Massa- 
chusetts Bay, bearing date October 7, 1691, were inserted, if is sup- 
posed, in the interest of Harvard College. Their insertion in that 
document is a striking proof of the position that the college then held 
in the life of the colony. Increase Mather, who was president of Har- 
vard at the time, according to President Quincy, was chiefly instru- 
mental in procuring the new charter, and in persuading the people of 
the colony to accept it.” 
These provisions are believed to be the only mention of schools, col- 
leges, education, or learning in the royal charters constituting or recog- 
nizing the American colonies. The antique spelling is preserved:

ORDINANCE OF JUNE 14, 1642. 
This court, taking into consideration the great neglect of many parents and mas- 
ters in training up their children in learningand labor, and other employments which 
may be profitable to the commonwealth, do hereupon order and decree that in every 
town the chosen men appointed for managing the prudential affairs of the same shall 
henceforth stand charged with the care of the redress of this evil, so as they shall be 
sufficiently punished by fines for the neglect thereof upon presentment of the grand 
jury, or any other information or complaint in any court within this jurisdiction; 
and for this end they, or the greater number of them, shall have the power to take 
account from time to time of all parents and masters, and of their children, concern- 
ing their calling and employment of their children, especially of their ability to read 
and understand the principles of religion and the capital laws of this country, and 
to impose fines upon such as shall refuse to render such accounts to them when they 
shall be required; and they shall have power, with consent of any court or the mag- 
istrate, to put forth apprentices the children of such as they shall [find] not to be able 
and fit to employ and bring them up. They shall take * * * employing them 
* * * up, nor shall take course to dispose of * * * themselves; and they are 
to take vare of such as are set to keep cattle be set to some other employment withal, 
ag spinning upon the rock, knitting, weaving tape, &c., and that boys and girls be 
not suffered to converse together, so as may occasion any wanton, dishonest, or 
immodest behaviour. And for their better performance of this trust committed to 
them, they may divide the town amongst them, appointing to every of the said 
townsmen a certain number of families to have special oversight of. They are 
also to provide that # sufficient quantity of materials, as henrp, flax, ete., may be 
raised in their several townes, and tools and implements provided for working out 
the same; and for their assistance in this so needful and beneficial employment, if 
they meet with any difficulty or opposition which they cannot well master by their 
own power, they may have recourse to some of the magistrates, who shall take such 
course for their help and encouragement as the occasion shall require according to 
justice; and the said townsmen, at the next court in those limits, after the end of 
their year, shall give a brief account in writing of their proceedings herein, provided 
that they have been so required by some court or magistrate a month at least before, 
and this order to continue for two years, and till the court shall take further order.?

ORDINANCE OF 1647. 
The following ordinance was adopted November 11, 1647: 
It being one of the chief projects of that old deluder Satan to keep men from the 
knowledge of the Seriptures, as in former times by keeping them in an unknown 
tongue, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so at 
least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded by false gloss is 
of saint-seeming deceivers, that learning may not be buried in the grave of ourfathers 
in the church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors: 
It is therefore ordered, That every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath 
increased them to the number of fifty householders, shall then forthwith appoint 
one within their town to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and 
read, whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, 
or by the inhabitants in general, by way of supply, as the major part of those that 
order the prudentials of the town shall appoint: Provided, Those that send their 
children be not oppressed by paying much more than they can have them taught for 
in other towns; and 
It is further ordered, That where any town shall increase to the number of one 
hundred families or householders, they shall set up a grammar school, the master 
thereof being able to instruct youth, so far as they may be fitted, for the university: 
Provided, That if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year, that 
every such town shall pay five pounds to the next school until they shall perform 
this order.! 
It is not quite certain which of the two foregoing statutes Lord 
Macaulay had in mind when he pronounced his famous eulogy upon 
Massachusetts in the House of Commons in 1847: 
Assuredly if there be any class of men whom the Protestant nonconformists of 
England respect more highly than another, if any whose memory they hold in 
deeper veneration, it is that class of men, of high spirit and unconquerable princi- 
ples, who in the days of Archbishop Laud preferred leaving their native country 
and living in the savage solitudes of a wilderness rather than to live in a land of 
prosperity and plenty where they could not enjoy the privilege of worshiping their 
Maker freely according to the dictates of their conscience. Those men, illustrious 
forever in history, were the founders of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. But 
though their love of freedom of conscience was illimitable and indestructible, they 
could see nothing servile or degrading in the principle that the State should take 
upon itself the charge of the education of the people. In the year 1642 they passed 
their first legislative enactment on this subject, in the preamble of which they dis- 
tinctly pledged themselves to this principle, that education was a matter of the 
deepest possible importance and greatest possible interest to all nations and to all 
communities, and that, as such, it was in an eminent degree deserving of the peculiar 
attention of the State.* 
[At the second session of the general court, held at Boston, the 19th of October, 1652.] 
a declaration concerning the advancement of learning in New England by the 
general court. 
If it should be granted that learning, namely, skill in the ton, 1es and liberal arts, 
is not absolutely necessary for the being of a Commonwealth and churches, yet we 
conceive that, in the judgment of the godly wise, it is beyond ali'*nestion not only 
laudable, but necessary for the well-being of the same; and although New England 
(blessed be God) is completely furnished (for this present age) with men in place, 
and upon occasion of death or otherwise, to make supply of magistrates, associates 
in courts, physicians, and officers in the Commonwealth, and of teaching elders in

the churches, yet for the better discharge of our trust for the next generation, and 
so to posterity, seeing the first founders do wear away apace, and that it grows 
more and more difficult to fill places of most eminence as they are empty or wanting; 
and this court, finding by manifest experience that though the number of scholars 
at our college doth increase, yet as svon as they grow up ready for public use they 
leave the country, and seek for and accept of employment. elsewhere, so that if 
timely. provision be not made it will tend much to the disparagement, if not to the 
ruin, of this Commonwealth: It is therefore ordered and hereby enacted by this 
court, that a voluntary collection be commended to the inhabitants of this jurisdie- 
tion for the raising of such a sum as may be employed for the maintenance of the 
president, certain fellows, and poor scholars in Harvard College, and for that pur- 
pose do further order, that every town of this jurisdiction do choose one meet per- 
son to take the voluntary subscriptions of such as shall underwrite any sum or 
sums of money for that purpose, and to make return thereof to the next court; and 
forasmuch as all the colonies are concerned therein, this court doth order the secre- 
‘tary to signify to the governor of the several colonies our endeavors herein, and to 
commend the same unto them for their help and furtherance in so good a work.! 
PAt a general court of election, Held at Boston, the 3rd of the 8rd month (May 8), 1654.] 
Ordered, Forasmuch as it greatly concerns the welfare of this country that the 
youth thereof be educated not only in good literature, but sound doctrine, this 
court doth therefore commend it to the serious consideration and special care of the 
overseers of the college and the selectmen in the several towns not to admit or suffer 
any such to be continued in the office or place of teaching, educating, or instructing 
of youth, or child, in the college or schools that have manifested themselves unsound 
in the faith or scandalous in their lives, and not giving due satisfaction according 
to the rules of Christ.? 
[At a gencral court for elections, held at Boston, the 81st of May, 1671,] 
Whereas the law requires every town, consisting of one hundred families er 
upward, to set up a grammar school, and appoint a master thereof, able to instruet 
youth so as to fit them for the college, and upon neglect thereof the said town is to 
pay five pounds per annum to the next Latin school until they shall perform that 
order, the court, upon weighty reasons, judge meet to declare and order, that every 
town of one hundred families and upwards that shall neglect or omit to keep a 
grammar school, as is provided in that law, such town shall pay ten pounds per 
annum unto the next town school that is set according to that law. 
Whereas in the law, title Townships, the several towns and selectmen of the said 
towns have power to impose penalties as the law directs; and whereas many con- 
stables question whether it be their duty to serve a from the selectmen for 
persons to appear before them and to levy fines for the removal of such doubts, and, 
as an addition to the said law,, this court doeth order and require that ail constables 
respectively shall serve all warrants from the selectmen, and levy all such fines as 
shall be imposed by the said towns or selectmen: 
* * * * * * * 
It is ordered by this court, and the authority thereof, That all gifts and legacies 
given and bequeathed to the college, schools of learning, or any other public use, 
shall be truly and faithfully disposed of according to the true and declared intent 
of the donors; and< and every person or persons intrusted to receive or improve 
any such gift or legacies shall be liable from time to time to give account of their 
disposal and manr- sement thereof to the county court of that shire where they 
dwell and where such estate shall lie, who are hereby empowered to require the 
same, where need shall be, to appoint feoffees of trust to settle and manage the same 
according to the will of the donors.®

[At the second session of the general court, held at Boston, October 10, 1683.] 
As an addition to the law title Schools, 
This court does order and enact, 
That every town consisting of more than five hundred families or householders 
‘Shall set up and maintain two grammar schools and two writing schools, the mas- 
ters whereof shall be fit and able to instruct youth as said law directs. 
And whereas the said law makes the penalty for such towns as provide not schools 
as the law directs to pay to the next school ten pounds: This court hereby enacts 
that the penalty shall be twenty pounds when there are two hundred families o1 
houscholders. 
The law requiring every person above the age of 16 years duly to 
attend all military exercise and service, as training, watching, warding, 
under penalty of 5 shillings for every fault, excepted from its opera- 
tion the president, fellows, students, and officers of Harvard College, 
and professed schoolmasters. 
AN ACT to provide for the instruction of youth and forthe promotion of good education (1789). 
Whereas the constitution of this Commonwealth hath declared it-to be the duty of 
the general court to provide for the education of youth; and whereas a general dis- 
semination of knowledge and virtue is necessary to the prosperity of every State 
and the very existence of a Commonwealth: 
Be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives in general court assembled, 
and.by the authority of the same, That every town or district within this Common- 
wealth, containing fifty families or householders, shall be provided with a school. 
master or schoolmasters of good morals, to teach children to read and write and te 
instruct them in the English language, as well as in arithmetic, orthography, and 
decent behavior, for such term of time as shall be equivalent to six months for one 
school in each year. And every town or district, containing one hundred families 
or householders, shall be provided with such schoolmaster or schoolmasters for such 
term of time as shall be equivalent to twelve months for one school in each year. 
And every town or district, containing one hundred and fifty families or householders, 
shall be provided with such schoolmaster or schoolmasters for such term of time as 
shall be equivalent to six months.in each year; and shall, in addition thereto, be 
provided with a schoolmaster or schoolmasters, as above described, to instruct chil. 
dren in the English language for such term of time as shall be equivalent to twelve 
months for one school in each year. And every town or district, containing twe 
hundred families or householders, shall be provided with a grammar schoolmastei 
of good morals, well instructed in the Latin, Greek, and English languages, anc 
shall, in addition thereto, be provided with a schoolmaster or schoolmasters, as above 
described, to instruct children in the English language, for such term of time a: 
shall be equivalent to twelve months for each of said schools in each year; and 
Whereas by means of the dispersed situation of the inhabitants of several towns 
and districts in this Commonwealth the children and youth can not be collected ix 
any one place for their instruction, and it has thence become expedient that th 
towns and districts in the circumstances aforesaid should be divided into separate 
districts for the purpose aforesaid: 
Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the several towns and district: 
in this Commenwealth be, and they are hereby, authorized and impowered, in tow 
meeting, to be called for that purpose, to determine and define the limits of schoo 
districts within their towns and districts respectively. : 
And to the end that grammar schoolmasters may not be prevented in their endeay 
ors to discharge their trust in the most useful manner— 
Beit further enacted, That no youth shall be sent to such grammar schools unles: 
they shall have learned in some other school or in some other way to read the Eng|

lish language by spelling the same, or the selectmen of the town where such gram- ~ 
mar school is shall direct the grammar schoolmaster to receive and instruct such 
youth. 
Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That it shall be, and it is hereby, 
made the duty of the president, professors, and tutors of the university at Cam- 
bridge, preceptors and teachers of academies, and all other instructors of youth, to 
take diligent care and to exert their best endeavors to impress on the minds of chil- 
dren and youth committed to their care and instruction the principles of piety, jus- 
tice, and a sacred regard to truth, love to their country, humanity, and universal 
benevolence, sobriety, industry, and frugality, chastity, moderation, and temperance, 
and those other virtues which are the ornament of human society, and the basis 
upon which the republican constitution is structured; and it shall be the duty of 
such instructors to endeavor to lead those under their eare (as their ages and capac- 
ities will admit) into a particular understanding of the tendeney of the before- 
mentioned virtues, to preserve and perfect a republican constitution, and to secure 
the blessings of liberty, as well as to promote their future happiness; and the tend- 
ency of the opposite vices to slavery and ruin. 
And to the end that improper persons may not be employed in the important offices 
before mentioned— : 
Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no person shall be employed as 
a schoolmaster as aforesaid unless he shall have received an education at some col- 
lege or university, and before entering on the said business shall produce satisfactory 
evidence thereof; or unless the person to be employed as aforesaid shall produce a cer- 
tificate from a learned minister, well skilled in the Greek and Latin languages, settled 
in the town or place where the school is proposed to be kept, or two other such min- 
isters in the vicinity thereof, that they have reason to believe that he is well quali- 
fied to discharge the duties devolved upon such schoolmaster by this act; and in 
addition thereto, if for a grammar school, ‘that he is of competent skill in the 
Greek and Latin languages for the said purpose.” And the candidate of either of 
the descriptions aforesaid shall, moreover, produce a certificate from a settled min- 
ister of the town, district, parish, or place to which such candidate belongs, or from 
the selectmen of such town or district, or committee of such parish or place, ‘‘that 
to the best of his or their knowledge he sustains a good moral character.” 4 
Provided, nevertheless, This last certificate respecting morals shall not be deemed 
necessary where the candidate for such school belongs to the place where the same 
is proposed to be actually kept; it shall, however, be the duty of such selectmen or 
committee who may be authorized to hire such schoolmaster specially to attend to 
his morals; and no settled minister shall be deemed, held, or accepted to bea school- 
master within the intent of this act. 
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any town or district, 
having the number of fifty families or householders and less than one hundred, shall 
neglect the procuring and supporting a schoolmaster or schoolmasters to teach the 
English language as aforesaid by the space of six months in one year, such deficient 
town or district shall incur the penalty of ten pounds, and a penalty proportionable 
for a less time than six months in a year, upon conviction thereof; and upon having 
the number of one hundred families or householders and upwards, shall neglect the 
procuring and supporting such schoolmaster or schoolmasters as is herein required to 
be kept by such town for the space of one year, every such deficient town or district 
shall ineur the penalty of twenty pounds, and a proportionable sum for a less time 
than a year, upon conviction of such neglect; and every town or district having 
one hundred and fifty families or householders which shall neglect the procuring 
and supporting such schoolmasters, and for such term of time as the schools afore-_ 
said are herein required to be kept by such town or district in any one year, shall 
ineur the penalty of thirty pounds, and a proportionable sum for a less time, upon 
conviction of such neglect; and every town or district having two hundred families
-P-A-G-E-18
  1236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
- or householders and upwards that shall neglect the procuring and supporting such 
grammar schoolmaster as aforesaid for the space of one year shall incur the penalty 
of thirty pounds, and a proportionable sum for a less time than a year, upon con- 
viction of such neglect. 
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the penalties which may be 
incurred by virtue of this act shall be levied by warrant from the supreme judiciary 
court or court of general sessions of the peace for the county to which such deficient 
town or district belongs upon the inhabitants of such deficient town or district in 
the same manner as other sums for the use of the county, and shall be paid into the 
county treasury, and the same shall be appropriated for the support of such school 
or schools as are prescribed by this law in such town or towns, district or districts, 
in the same county as shall have complied with this law and whose circumstances 
most require such assistance, or in such plantation or plantations in the same county 
as the said court of sessions shall order and direct; and it shall be the duty of the 
minister or ministers of the gospel and the selectmen (or such other persons as shall 
be specially chosen by each town or district for that purpose) of the several towns 
or districts to use their influence and best endeavors that the youth of their respective 
towns and districts do regularly attend the schools appointed and supported as afore- 
said for their instruction, and once in every six months at least, and as much oftener 
as they shall determine it necessary, to visit and inspect the several scbools in their 
respective towns and districts, and shall enquire into the regulation and discipline 
thereof and the proficiency of the scholars therein, giving reasonable notice of the 
time of their visitation. 
Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all plantations which shall be taxed to 
the support of government, and all parishes and precincts, are hereby authorized — 
and empowered, at their annual meeting in March or April, to vote and raise such 
sums of money upon the polls and rateable estates of their respective inhabitants 
for the support and maintenance of a schooimaster to teach their children and youth 
to read, write, and cipher as they shall judge expedient, to be assessed by their 
assessors in due proportion, and to be collected in like manner with the public taxes. 
And whereas schools for the education of children in the most early stages of life 
may be kept in towns, districts, or plantations, which schools are not before particu- 
larly described in this act, and that the greatest attention may be given to the early 
establishing just principles in the tender minds of such children and carefully 
instructing them in the first principles of reading— 
Be it enacted, That no person shall be allowed to be a master or mistress of such” 
school, or to keep the same, unless he or she shall obtain a certificate from the select- 
men of such town or district where the same may be kept, or the committee appointed 
by such town, district or plantation to visit their schools, as well as from a learned 
minister settled therein, if such there be, that le or she is a person of sober life and 
conversation, and well qualified to keep such school. And it shall be the duty of 
-such master or mistress carefully to instruct the children attending his or her school 
in reading (and writing, if contracted for), and to instill into their minds a sense of 
piety and virtue and to teach them decent behavior. And if any person shall pre- 
sume to keep such schovl without a certificate as aforesaid, he or she shall forfeit 
and pay the sum of twenty shillings; one moiety thereof to the informer, and the 
other moiety to the use of the poor of the town, district, or plantation where such 
school may be kept. 
Be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That no person shall be permitted to 
keep within this Commonwealth any school described in this act unless in conse- 
‘quence of an act of naturalization, or otherwise, he shall be a citizen of this or some 
other of the United States; and if any persen who is not a citizen of this or some one 
of the United States shall presume to keep any such school within this State for the 
space of one month, he shall be subjected to pay a fine of twenty pounds, and a pro- 
portionable sum for a longer or shorter time; the one-half of which fine shall be to
-P-A-G-E-19
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1237 
the use of the person who shall sue for the same, and the other half thereof to the 
use of this Commonwealth. 
And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That all fines and forfeitures for 
a breach of this act shall be recovered by Dill, plaint, or information before any 
court proper to try the same; and all grand jurors shall diligently enquire and pre- 
sentment make of all breaches and neglects of this law. 
And be it further enacted by the-authority aforesaid, That this act shall be in foree 
and operate from and after the first day of October next.! 
About the close of the colonial period schools and education suffered 
a declension in Massachusetts. Said Dr. George B. Emerson in 1869: 
The common schools and the town grammar schools continued to decline. In the 
busy world of Massachusetts men of ability found more profitable employment; 
and the great truth was not yet discovered that women, as teachers and managers 
and governors of boys, even up to manhood, are often gifted at least as highly as 
men. Most of the boys were fitted for college by ministers of the gospel, among 
whom I have the best possible means of knowing that a practice of teaching the 
elements of the Latin language as a spoken language very generally prevailed as 
late as one hundred years ago. 
Academies and private schools grew more and more numerous; sometimes endowed 
by public-spirited individuals, sometimes by grants of land from the State, often by 
both, and usually supported in part by fees from the students. In 1834 there were 
more than nine hundred and fifty of these schools. ‘Those under the supervision of 
resolute, judicious men, who knew the value of good teaching and how to secure it, 
~ and sometimes others, by a fortunate accident or a gracious Providence, had good 
teachers and flourished. But the greater number were very poor schools; so also 
were most of the town schools, and the belief and intimate conviction that most of 
the common schools were wretchedly poor became, except amongst the most igno- 
rant of the teachers themselves and the most benighted of the people, almost uni- 
versal, 
The act of 1789, up to which time the laws of which I have been speaking con- 
tinued in operation, was a wide departure from the principle of the original law. 
It substitutes six months for the constant instruction provided for towns of 50 fami- 
lies, and requires a grammar teacher of determinate qualifications for towns of 200 
families, instead of the similar requisition from all towns of half that number of 
inhabitants. Still, however, far as it falls short of that noble democratic idea of 
the Puritans of providing the best possible instruction for all, it would, if in force 
at the present day, render instruction of the highest kind accessible to the children 
of more than two-thirds of the towns of the Commonwealth. 
John Adams, writing in 1782 to the Abbé De Mably, finds the key to 
the history of New England in four institutions—the towns or districts, 
the congregations or religious societies, the schools, and the militia. This 
is the paragraph in which he describes the schools: i 
There are schools in every town, established by an express law of the colony. 
Every town containing 60 families is obliged, under a penalty, to maintain con- 
stantly a school and a schoolmaster, who shall teach his scholars reading, writing, 
arithmetic, and the rudiments of the Latin and Greek languages. All the children 
of the inhabitants, the rich as well as the poor, have a right to go to these public

schools. There are formed the candidates for admission as students into colleges at 
Cambridge, New Haven, Princeton, and Dartmouth. In these colleges are educated 
future masters for these schools, future ministers for these congregations, doctors of 
law and medicine, and magistrates and officers for the government of the country.! 
President Dwight, of Yale College, gives this picture: 
A stranger traveling through New England marks with not a little surprise the 
multitude of schoolhouses appearing everywhere at little distances. Familiarized 
as Iam to the sight, they have excited no small interest in my mind, particularly 
as I was traveling through the settlements recently begun. Here, while the inhabit- 
ants were still living in log huts, they had not only erected schoolhouses for their 
children, but had built them in a neat style, so as to throw an additional appearance 
of deformity over their own clumsy habitations. This attachment to education in 
New England is universal, and the situation of that hamlet must be bad indeed 
which, if it contains a sufficient number of children for a school, does not provide 
the necessary accommodations. In 1803 I found neat sehoolhouses in Colebrook and 
Stewart, bordering on the Canadian line.? 
The public statutes of Massachusetts relating to public instruction, 
1888, furnish interesting items of historical information pertinent to 
the subject. In 1817 school districts were made corporations, and were 
empowered to hold property for the use of schools. In 1826 a town con- 
taining 500 families was required to maintain a town or high school, 
and if it contained 4,000 inhabitants it was required to maintain such 
a school in which the classical languages were taught. The law of that 
year also required the towns to elect a town school committee. The 
State school fand was established in 1834; the State legislature took 
its first action in relation to normal schools in 1837, and two years later 
two such schools were opened. A normal art school was established in 
Boston in 1873. Teachers’ institutes were first established in the State 
in 1845. Massachusetts is the only State in the Union that makes the 
provision of public high schools obligatory upon the towns. 
Il. PLYMOUTH LEGISLATION, 1658-1677. 
The Plymouth colony records contain the following entries in rela-

Le 
No State has a more honorable educational record, taken altogether, 
than Connecticut. No other of the old States can show such a con- 
nected series of public and private transactions relating to schools 
and education, extending from the foundation of the Commonwealth 
down to the opening of the present educational area, some fifty or 
sixty years ago. Accordingly, the State affords the best possible 
opportunity to study continuously the history of poptiar education 
from the feeblest beginnings. The following compilation of documents 
is made from The History of Common Schools in Connecticut, which 
Dr. Henry Barnard prepared and first published when he was superin- 
tendent of common schools of that State, and afterwards republished 
in The American Journal of Education. [Vol. IV, 657, et seq.] 
The history of Connecticut begins with the founding of Hartford in 
1635. The earliest records of the town are lost, but in 1642 an appro 
priation of £30 was made for the support of a school, not as a new 
thing, but as one of the establishments of the town. In April, 1643 
it was ordered at a general town meeting— 
That Mr. Andrew should teach the children in the school one year next ensuing 
from the 25th of March, 1643, and that he shall have for his pains £16; and there- 
fore the townsmen shall go and inquire who will engage themselves to send their 
children; and all that do so shall pay for one quarter at the least, and for more if 
they do send them, after the proportion of twenty shillings the year, and if they go 
any weeks more than an even quarter, they shall pay sixpence a week; and if any 
would send their children who are not able to pay for their teaching, they shall give 
notice of it to the townsmen, and they shall pay it at the town’s charge; and Mr. 
Andrew shall keep the account between the children’s schooling and himself, and 
send notice of the times of payments and demand it; and if his wages do not come 
in, the townsmen must collect and pay it; or if the engagements come not to six- 
teen pounds, then they shall pay what is wanting at the town’s charge. 
In February, 1648, the following action was had: 
Tho necessities of the town and the desires of many, calling for some provision to 
be made for the keeping of a school with better conveniency than hithertc hath been 
attained, the want whereof hath been both uncomfortable to those who have been 
employed in that service and prejudicial to the work under hand, which is looked 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1241 
upon as conducing mueh to the good of the present age, and that of the future: It 
was agreed and consented to by the town that forty pounds shall be paid in the 
way of arate to the townsmen for the time being for carrying on the said work, 
which being considered to fall much short of attaining the end in building such 
house as may be suitible for the said employment. 
It was agreed unto by the town that in case any other shall make such an 
addition to the said sum that the work may be carried on and finished, either with 
timber or brick, as may be judged most convenient, that the building so to be 
erected shall not be diverted to any other use or employment but in a way of 
schooling without the consent of the parties that shall contribute. * * * 
In a subsequent meeting the following vote was passed: 
The town chose Mr. Talcott, Mr. Fitch, and Goodman Stebbins, John Barnard, as 
their committee, to act for them, either in buying or building a house for a school- 
honse; and if they do agree to build, they are not to exceed the sum of money that 
was due to the town from Mr. Goodwin; and if they buy, they are not to exceed the 
sum of money due from Mr. Goodwin; and the town doth engage to stand what 
their committee shall do in this business. 
The other towns composing the. colony followed the same mode of 
supporting schools. Education was partly a public and partly a private 
charge. For example, Weathersfield voted in March, 1658, 
That Mr. Thomas Lord should be schoolmaster for the year ensuing, and to have 
twenty-five pounds for the year, and also the use of the house lot, and the use of the 
meadow as formerly; and the twenty-five pounds is to be raised—of the children 
eight shillings per head of such as come to school, and the remainder by rate of all 
the inhabitants made by the lists of estates. 
In 1650 a codification of laws for the government of the Common- 
wealth was made. The titles “Children” and “Schools,” according to 
Dr. Barnard, with trifling modifications, and such only as were calcu- 
lated to give them greater efficiency, remained on the statute book for 
one hundred and fifty years. Ié will be seen that the author of the 
compilation borrowed a familiar statute from Massachusetts: 
CHILDREN. 
Forasmuch as the good Education of Children is of singular behoofe and benefitt 
to any Commonwealth; and whereas many parents and masters are too indulgent 
and negligent of theire duty in that kind ;— 
It is therefore ordered by this Courte and Authority thereof, that the Select men of 
euery Towne in the several precincts and quarters where they dwell, shall have a 
vigilant eye over their brethern and neighbors, to see, first, that none of them shall 
suffer so much barbarism in any of their families, as not to endeavor to teach by 
themselves or others, their children and apprentices so much learning as may enable 
them perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowledge of the capital laws, upon 
penalty of twenty shillings for each neglect therein; also, that all masters of fami- 
lies, do, once a week, at least catechise their children and servants, in the grounds 
and principles of religion; and if any be unable to doso much, that then, at the 
least, they procure such children or apprentices to learn some short orthodox eate- 
chism, without book, that they may be able to answer to the questions that shall be 
propounded to them out of such catechisms by their parents or masters, or any 
selectmen, when they shall call them to a trial of what they have learned in this 
kind; and further, that all parents and masters do breed and bring up their children 
and apprentices in some honest lawful [calling,] labor, or employment, either in
-P-A-G-E-24
  1242 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
husbandry or some other trade profitable for themselves and the commonwealth, if 
they will not nor can not train them up in learning, to fit them for higher employ- 
ments, and if any of the selectmen, after admonition by them given to such masters 
of families, shall find them still negligent of their duty, in the particulars afore- 
mentioned, whereby children and servants become rude, stubborn and unruly, the 
said selectmen, with the help of two magistrates, shall take such children or 
apprentices from them, and place them with some masters for years, boys until they 
come to twenty-one, and girls to eighteen years of age complete, which will more 
strictly look unto and force them to submit unto government, according to the rules 
of this order, if by fair means and former instructions they will not be drawn unto it. 
The following enactments constitute sections 14 and 15 of the capital 
laws: 
Secrion 14. If any child or children above sixteen years old and of sufficient 
understanding, shall curse or smite their natural father or mother, he or they shall 
be put to death; unless it can be sufficiently testified, that the parents have been 
very unchristianly ‘negligent in the education of such children, or so provoke them 
by extreme and cruel correction that they have been forced thereunto to preserve 
themselves from death or maiming. 
Section 15. If any man has a stubborn, or rebellious son of sufficient understand- 
ing and years, viz, sixteen years of age, which will not obey the voice of his father, 
or the voice of his mother, and that where they have chastized him, he will not 
hearken unto them; then may his father or mother being his natural parents lay hold 
on him and bring him to the magistrates assembled in court, and testify unto them 
that their son is stubborn, and rebellions, and will not obey their voice and chastise- 
ment, but lives in sundry notorious crimes, such a son shall be put to death. 
SCILOOLS. 
It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowl- 
edge of the Scriptures, as in former times, keeping them in an unknown tongue, so 
in these latter times, by persuading them from the use of tongues, so that at least, 
the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded with false glosses of 
saint seeming deceivers; and that learning may not be buried in the grave of our 
forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors: 
It is therefore ordered by this court and authority thereof, That every township within 
this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty house- 
holders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their town to teach all such, 
children, as shall resort to him, to write and read, whose wages shall be paid, either 
by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in general, by way 
of supply, as the major part of those who order the prudentials of the town, shall 
appoint; provided, that those who send their children be not oppressed by paying 
more than they can have them taught for in other towns. 
And it is further ordered, That where any town shall increase to the number of one 
hundred families, or householders, they shall set up a grammar school, the masters 
thereof being able to instruct youths, so far as they may be fitted, for the university, 
and if any town neglect the performance hereof above one year, then every such 
town shall pay five pounds per annum, to the next such school, till they shall per- 
form this order. 
The proposition concerning the maintenance of scholars at Cambridge, made by 
the commissioners, is confirmed. 
And it is ordered, That two men shall be appointed in every town within this juris- 
diction, who shall demand what every family will give, and the same to be gathered 
and brought into some room, in March; and this to continue yearly, as it shall be 
considered by the commissioners.

  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1243 
IL. 
New Haven dates from 1638, and there is evidence showing the exist- 
ence of a school in the colony in the following year. On the 25th of 
the twelfth month, 1641, the general court adopted the following order: 
It is ordered, That a free school be set up in this town, and our pastor, Mr. Daven- 
port, together with the magistrates, shall consider what yearly allowance is meet to 
be given to it out of the common stock of the town, and also what rules and orders 
are meet to be observed in and about the same, 
The following order relates to a public grammar school that was 
established in New Haven two or three years later, and placed under 
the charge of Hzekiel Cheever: 
For the better training up of youth in this town, that through God’s blessing they 
may be fitted for public service hereafter in church or Commonwealth, it is ordered 
that a free school be set up, and the magistrates, with the teaching elders, are 
entreated to consider what rules and orders are meet to be observed, and what allow- 
ance may be convenient for the schoo!master’s care and pains, which shall be paid 
out of the town’s stock. 
General court, in November, 1644, adopted the first of a series of 
orders in relation to aiding such children as should show the requisite 
talent, but whose parents were not able to support them at the college 
at Cambridge: 
The proposition for the relief of poor scholars at the college at Cambridge was 
fully approved of, and thereunto it was ordered that Joshua Atwater and William 
Davis shall receive of everyone in this plantation whose heart is willing to con- 
tribute thereunto a peck of wheat, or the value of it. 
The following entry, made under the date of November 8, 1652, is 
but one of many similar entries that could be quoted from the public 
records of the colony: 
The governor informed the court that the cause of calling this meeting is about a 
schoolmaster, to let them know what he hath done in it, He hath written a letter to 
one Mr. Bower, who is a schoolmaster at Plymouth, and desires to come into these 
parts to live, and another letter to one Rev. Mr. Landson, a scholar, who he hears 
will take that employment upon him. How they will succeed he knows not but now 
Mr. Janes has come to town, and is willing to come hither again if he may have 
encouragement; what course had been taken to get one he was acquainted with, 
and if either of them come Ke must be entertained; but he said, if another come, he 
should be willing to teach boys and girls to read and write if the town thought fit, 
and Mr. Janes being now present confirmed it. 
The town generally was willing to encourage Mr. Janes his coming, and would 
allow him at least ten pounds a year out of the treasury, and the rest he might take 
of the parents of the children he teacheth by the quarter, as he did before, to make 
up a comfortable maintenance; and many of the town thought there would be need 
of two schoolmasters—for if a Latin schoolmaster come, it is feared he will be dis- 
couraged if many English scholars come to him. Mr. Janes, seeing the town’s will- 
ingness for his coming again, acknowledged their love, and desired them to proceed 
no further in it at this time, for he was sure he shall get free where he is, and if he 
do, he doubt it will not be before winter. Therefore no more was done at it at 
present. 
The town was informed that there is some motion again én foot concerning the 
setting up of a college here at New Haven, which, if attained, will in all likelihood
-P-A-G-E-26
  1244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
prove very beneficial to-this place, but now is only propounded to know the town’s 
mind, and whether they are willing to further the work by bearing a meet proportion 
of charge if the jurisdiction upon the proposal thereof shall see cause to carry it 
on. No man objected, but all seemed willing, provided that the pay which they 
can raise here will do it. : 
Governor Katon’s code of 1655, drawn up at a time when the colony 
contained but seven towns, has a provision in relation to the education 
of children that may be prefaced with a remark or two. Dr. Barnard 
says that Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport have the credit of 
establishing in New Haven, before it ceased to be an independent colony, 
a system of public instruction at that time without a parallel in any 
part of the world, and not surpassed in its universal application to all 
classes, rich and poor, at any period in the subsequent history of the 
State. The main motor force that acted in producing this result, as 
wellas in producing similar results in, Massachusetts, appears upon the 
surface. It is the principle of religion. Says Mr. John Fiske: 
The Puritan theory of life lay at the bottom of the whole system of popular educa- 
tion in New England. According to this theory, it was absolutely essential that 
_everyone should be taught from early childhood to read and understand the Bible. 
So much instruction as this was assumed to be a sacred duty which the community 
owed to every child born within its jurisdiction.' 
CHILDREN’S EDUCATION. 
This is the provision in question: 
Whereas too many parents and masters, either through an over tender respect to 
their own occasions and business, or not duly considering the good of their children 
and apprentices, have too much neglected duty in their education while they are 
young and capable of learning; 
Itis ordered, That the deputies for the particular court in each plantation within 
this jurisdiction for the time being, or where there are no such deputies the con- 
stable or other officer. or officers in public trust, shall from time to time have a 
vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbors within the limits of the said planta- 
tion; that all parents and masters do duly endeavor, either by their own ability and 
labor, or by employing such schoolmaster or other helps and means as the planta- 
tion doth afford or the family may conveniently provide, that all their children and 
apprentices, as they grow capable, may through God’s blessing attain at least so 
much as to be able duly to read the Scriptures and other good and profitable printed 
books in the English tongue, being their native language, and in some competent 
measure to understand the main grounds and principles of the Christian religion 
necessary to salvation, and to give adue answer tosuch plain and ordinary questions 
as may by the said deputies, officer, or officers, be propounded concerning the same- 
And when such deputies, or officers, whether by information or examination, shall 
find any parent or master, one or more, negligent, he or they shall first give warning. 
and if thereupon due reformation follow, if the said parents or masters shall thence- 
forth seriously and constantly apply themselves to their duty in manner before 
expressed, the former neglect may be passed by; but if not, then the said deputies 
and other officer or officers shall, three months after such warning, present each such 
negligent person or persons to the next plantation court, where such delinquent, 
upon proof, shall be fined ten shillings to the plantation, to be levied as other fines. 
And if in any plantation there be no such court kept for the present, in such case 
1The Beginnings of New England, p. 151.
-P-A-G-E-27
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY, 1245 
‘the constable, or other officer or officers, warning such person or persons, before the 
freemen or so many of them as upon notice shall meet together and proving the 
neglect after the warning, shall have the power to levy the fine as aforesaid. But 
if in three months after that there be no due care taken and continued for the educa- 
tion of such children or apprentices as aforesaid, the delinquent (without any further 
private warning) shall be proceeded against as before, but the fine doubled. And, 
lastly, if, after the said warning and fines paid or levied, the said deputies, officer, or 
officers, shall still find a continuance of the former negligence, if it be not obstinacy, 
so that such children or servants may be in danger to grow barbarous, rude, and 
stubborn through ignorance, they shall give due and seasonable notice that every 
such parent and master be summoned to the next court of magistrates, who are to 
proceed as they find cause, either to a greater fine, taking security for due conformity 
to the scope and intent of this law, or may take such children or apprentices from 
such parents and masters, and place them for years—boys till they come to the age 
of one and twenty, and girls till they come to the age of eighteen years, with such 
others who shall better educate and govern them, both for the public conveniency 
and for the particular good of the said children or apprentices. 
cEETS 
The union of the colonies of Connecticut and New Haven, or perhaps it 
would be better to say the absorption of New Haven by Connecticut, 
was consummated under the charterof 1662. The Connecticut code was 
now extended over the united colonies, including its educational pro- 
visions. In 1672 a new clause took the place of the old ones relating to 
the college at Cambridge and the town and grammar schools. At this 
time the colony consisted of four counties, and the general court voted to 
each of the four county towns forever 600 acres of land, to be improved 
in the best manner that may be for the benefit of a grammar school in 
said county towns, and to no other use or end whatever. This is the 
new clause: 
And it is further ordered, That in- every county there shall be set up and kept a 
grammar school for the use of the county, the master thereof being able to instruct 
youths so far as they may be fitted for college. 
At the May session of the court, 1677, a new order was adopted, as 
follows: 
Whereas in the law, title Schools, it is ordered that every county town shall keep 
and maintain a Latin school in the said town, which is not fully attended to in some 
places, to move, excite, and stir up to the attendance of so wholesome an order; 
It is ordered by this court, That if any county town shall neglect to keep a Latin 
school according to order, there shall be paid a fine of ten pounds by the said county 
towns to the next town in that county that will engage and keep a Latin school in it, 
and so ten pounds annually till they shall come up to the attendance of this order; 
the grand jury to make presentment of the breach of this order to the county court 
of all such breaches as they shall find after September next. 
It is also ordered by this court, Where schools are to be kept in any town, whether 
it be county town or otherwise, which shall be necessary to the maintaining the 
charge of such schools, it shall be raised upon the inhabitants by way of rate, except 
any town shall agree to some other way to raise the maintenance of him they shall 
employ in the aforesaid works, any order to the contrary notwithstanding. 
And at the same time it was ordered that any town that shall neglect 
to keep a school above three months in the year shall forfeit £5 for every
-P-A-G-E-28
  1246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
defect, which said fine shall be paid toward the Latin school in their 
county. All breaches of this order to be taken notice of and presented 
by the grand jury at every county court. In the following year the 
general court recommended— 
To the county court of Fairfield, to grant unto the inhabitants of Paquanake so 
much out of their county revenue by customs, fines, etc., so much as their rate shall 
come to, toward the maintenance of a grammar school at Fairfield, and also this 
court doth recommend it to the said court of Fairfield to improve so much of their 
county revenues as they can spare besides for the settlement and encouragement 
of a grammar school there. 
In 1690 the court endeavored to raise two of the four county grammar 
schools to a higher level, and to make them wholly free. The school 
revenue given by particular persons is supposed to refer to the Hop- 
kins legacy which occupies an important place in the educational his- 
tory of the colony. 
| This court, considering the necessity and advantage of good literature, do order and 
appoint that there shall be two good free schools kept and maintained in this colony 
for the schooling of all such children as shall come there after they can distinctly 
read the psalter, to be taught reading, writing, arithmetic, the Latin and English 
languages—the one at Hartford and the other at New Haven—the masters whereof 
shall be chosen by the magistrates and ministers of the said counties, and shall be 
inspected and displaced by them if they see cause. Each master is to receive sixty 
pounds, thirty pounds of which is to be paid out of the county treasury and the 
other thirty out of the school revenue given by particular persons or to be given for 
this use so far as it will extend, and the rest to be paid by the respective towns of 
Hartford and New Haven. 
| Strenuous attempts were made to enforce a sufficient provision for 
schools. In 1677 it was ordered: 
If any county town shall neglect to keep a Latin school according to order, there 
shall be paid a fine of ten pounds by the said county town to the next ove in 
the county that will keep a Latin school in it. 
In 1678 it was ordered: 
That every town, when the Lord shall have increased their families to thirty in 
number, shall have and maintain a school to teach children to read and write, on 
the penalty expressed in the former law. 
In 1690 it was enacted as follows: 
This court observing that notwithstanding the former orders made for the educa- 
tion of children and servants, there are many persons unable to read the English 
tongue, and thereby unable to read the Holy Word of God and the good laws of 
the colony, and it is hereby ordained that all parents and masters shall cause their 
children and servants, as they are capable, to read distinctly the English tongue, and 
that the grand jury men in each town do once in the year, at least, visit each family 
they suspect to neglect this order, and satisfy themselves that all children under 
age, and servants in such suspected families, can read well the English tongue, or 
in good procedure to learn the same or not, and if they tind such children or serv- 
ants not taught as their years are capable of, they shall return the names of the 
parents or masters of the said children to the next county court, when said parents 
or masters shall be fined twenty shillings for each child or servant whose teaching 
is thus neglected according to this order. After the order of 1690, unless it shall
-P-A-G-E-29
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1247 
appear to the satisfaction of the court that the said neglect was not voluntary, but 
necessitated by the incapacity of the parents, or masters, or their neighbors to 
cause them to be taught as aforesaid, or the incapacity of the said children or sery- 
ants to learn. 
In the revised edition of the laws, completed in 1700 and printed in 
1702, the Act for educating children remains as in the code of 1650, 
with the following provision regarding stubborn or rebellious children: 
And be it further enacted, ete., That whatsoever child or servant within this colony, 
upon complaint, shall be convicted of any stubborn or rebellious carriage against 
their parents or governors, any two assistants or justices are hereby authorized and 
empowered to commit such person or persons to the house of correction, there to 
remain under hard labor and severe punishment so long as they shall judge meet. 
The act concerning Schools is modified so as to read as follows 
An Act for appointing schools, and for the encouragement of schoolmasters. 
Be it enacted by the governor, council, and representatives, convened in general court 
or assembly, and it is enacted and ordained by the authority of the same, That every 
town within this colony, having the number of seventy householders or upwards 
shall be constantly provided of a sufficient schoolmaster to teach the children 
and youth to read and write; and every town having a less number of house- 
holders than seventy shall yearly, from year to year, be provided of a sufficient 
schoolmaster to teach children and youth to read and write for one half of the 
year. ‘And also there shali be a grammar school set up in every head town of the 
several counties in this colony, viz, in Hartford, New Haven, New London, Fair- 
field, and some discreet person of good conversation, well instructed in the tongues, 
procured to keep such school. 
And for the encouragement and maintenance of schoolmasters. 
Itis further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the inhabitants of each town in 
this colony shallannually pay forty shillings for every thousand pounds in their 
respective county lists, and proportionately for lesser sums, toward the maintenance — 
of the schoolmaster in the town where the same is levied; and in such towns where 
the said levy shall not be sufficient for the maintenance of a suitable schoolmaster, 
and there is not any estate given by any charitable persons, or not sufficient together 
with the levy aforesaid for that use, in every such place a sufficient maintenance 
shall be made up, the one-half thereof by the inhabitants of such town and the 
other half thereof by the parents or masters of the children that go to school, unless 
any town agree otherwise. And when, and so often as the treasurer sends forth his 
warrants for levying the county rates, he shall also, together with the county rate, 
assess the inhabitants of the several towns in this colony the said sum of forty shil- 
lings upon every thousand pounds, and proportionately for lesser sums in their county 
lists, adding the same to their respective preportions of the county rate, and requir- 
ing the constables to levy the said assessments upon the inhabitants of each town 
within their several precincts, and to make payment thereof to the schoolmaster of 
the town (if any there be) where the same is levied; and in such town or towns 
where there is no schoolmaster provided according to law, to levy the said assess- 
ment, and to pay the same into the county treasury as a fine imposed upon such 
town for their defect. 
Always provided, That no town shall be fined for want of a schoolmaster for one 
month only in one year. 
Dr. Barnard thus sums up the system of public instruction witless 
in Connecticut at the opening of the eighteenth century: 
1, An obligation on every parent and guardian of children, “not to 
suffer so much barbarism in any of their families as to have a single
-P-A-G-E-30
  1248 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
child or apprentice unable to read the Holy Word of God and the good 
laws of the colony,” and also “to bring them up to some lawful calling 
or employment,” under a penalty for each offense. 
2. A tax of 40 shillings on every 1,000 pounds of the lists of estates 
was collected in every town with the annual State tax, and payable 
proportionably to those towns only which should keep their schools 
according to law. 
3. A common school in every town having over 70 families, kept 
throughout the year, and in every town with less than 70 families kept 
for at least six months in the year. 
4, A grammar school in each of the 4 head county towns to fit youth 
for college, 2 of which grammar schools must be free. 
5. A collegiate school, toward which the general court made an 
annual appropriation of £120. 
6. Provision for the religious instruction of tho Indians. 
All through the eighteenth century the general court continued to 
enact school legislation. The following bears the date of October, 1715: 
AN ACT for the more effectual suppressing of immorality and irreligion, and for putting in due exo- 
cution sundry laws already made against vice and profaneness. 
Whereas, in May, anno Domini one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, it was 
by the governor, council, and representatives in general court assembled, recom- 
mended to the general association of the churches in this colony to inquire into the 
state of religion in this government. 
In compliance wherewith the said association, upon due inquiry made, reported 
to this assembly at this time the several following heads, viz: 
I. A want of Bibles in particular families. 
II. Remissness and great neglect of attendance on the public worship of 
God upon Sabbath days and other seasons. 
Ill. Catechising being too much neglected in sundry places. 
IV. Great deficiency in domestical or family government. 
VY. irregularity in commutative justice upon several accounts. 
VI. Tale-bearing and defamation. 
VI. Calumniating and contempt of authority and order, both civil and 
ecclesiastical. 
VIII. And intemperance, with several other things therein mentioned. 
The which particular heads this assembly hath now considered, and are fearful 
that there hath been too great a neglect of a due execution of those good laws 
already enacted amongst us for the prevention of such decays in religion. 
It is therefore enacted by the governor, council, and representatives in general court 
assembled, and by the authority of the same, That all judges and justices of the peace, 
in the respective counties of this colony, be diligent and strict in putting in execu- 
tion all those laws and acts of this assembly made for the suppressing and punish- 
ing all or any of the above-mentioned immoralities and irreligious practices, that 
thereby the good end proposed in such acts and laws may be attained. 
That the selectmen, constables, and grand jurors, in the respective towns in this 
colony shall from time to time strictly observe the following directions: 
To a due execution of the law of this colony, entitled ‘An act for educating of 
children,” in all and every the several parts and paragraphs of the said act. 
That the selectmen make diligent inquiry of all householders, within their respec- 
tive towns, how they are stored with Bibles; and upon such inquiry, if any such 
householders be fouud without one Bible at least, that then the said selectmen shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1249 
warn the said householders forthwith to procure one Bible at least for the use and 
benefit of said family; and if the same be neglected, then the said selectmen shalt 
make return thereof to the next authority; and that all those families which are. 
numerous, and whose circumstances will allow thereof, shall be supplied with a 
considerable number of Bibles, according to the number of persons in such families; 
and that they see that all such families be furnished with suitable numbers of 
orthodox catechisms and other good books of practical godliness, viz., such 
especially as treat on, encourage, and duly prepare for the right attendance on that _ 
duty of the Lord’s Supper. 
That the constables and grand jurymen in the respective towns in this colony 
shall make diligent search after, and presentment of, all breaches of the following 
laws of this colony: 
1. The law entitled ‘‘An act for educating of children.” 
2, The two last paragraphs of the law entitled ‘‘An act relating to ecclesi- 
astical affairs.” 
3. The first paragraph of the law entitled “An act for the better detecting 
and more effectual punishing profaneness and immorality.” 
4, The law entitled ‘“‘An act for the better observation and keeping the 
Sabbath or Lord’s Day.” 
5. The law entitled ‘An act for the punishment of lying.” 
6. The law entitled ‘‘An act against profane swearing, &c.” 
7. The law entitled ‘‘An act to prevent unseasonable meetings of young 
people in the evenings after the Sabbath days and at other times. 
And to the end that all branches of the said law may be duly put in execution: 
It is now resolved, That the constables and grand jurymen in the respective towns 
shall, on the evenings mentioned in the said law, walk the streets, and search all 
places suspected for harboring or entertaining any people or persons assembling 
contrary to the said act. 
8. The law entitled ‘Au act for preventing tippling and drunkenness.” 
9, The law entitled “An act for suppressing unlicensed houses, and due 
regulating such as are or shall be licensed in the several paragraphs 
thereof.” 
10. The law entitled “‘An act for suppressing certain meetings in licensed 
houses ;” and this law shall be understood and extended to, to prohibit _ 
heads of families and all other persons, as well as young persons 
(strangers and travelers only excepted) under the same penalties in the 
said law, as well to tavern keepers, as to others so convening. é 
11, And that the several constables in the respective towns shall strictly 
observe and duly execute the several paragraphs of the law entitled 
“An act relating to constables,” by making due presentment and 
information of all breaches of the said law, and warning all persons 
3 in their respective towns who spend their time idly or are tipplers and 
tavern haunters. 
12. That the constables and grand jurymen in their respective precincts 
shall take due care that the Lord’s Day be sanetified according to the 
law, by inquiring after and making presentment of all such who shall 
profane the said day. 
And it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this act, together with a 
proclamation enforcing it, be forthwith printed, aud published throughout this 
colony; and that they shall be publicly read annually in the several towns in this 
colony at their public meetings for choice of town officers. And that the said 
meeting be careful in the choice of their said constables and grand jurymen, that. 
they choose men of known abilities, integrity, and good resolutions.

  1250 EDUCATION REPORT, 1899-93. 
And the following in October, 1742: 
AN ACT relating to and for the better regulating schools of learning. 
Whereas by sundry acts and laws of this assembly they have founded, erected, 
endowed, and provided for the maintenance of a college at New Haven, and inferior 
schools of learning in every town or parish for the education and instruction of the 
youth of this colony, which have (by the blessing of God) been very serviceable to 
promote useful learning and Christian knowledge, and more especially to train up a 
learned orthodox ministry for the supply of our churches, and inasmuch as the well- 
ordering of such public schools is of great importance to the public weal, this 
assembly, by one act entitled ‘‘An act for the encouragement and better improve- 
ment of town schools,” did order and provide that the civil authority and selectmen 
in every town should be visitors to inspect the state of such schools, and to inquire 
into the qualifications of the masters of them, and the proficiency of the children, to 
give such directions as they shall think needful to render such schools more service- 
able to increase that knowledge, civility, and religion which is designed in the 
erecting of them. And in case those visitors shall apprehend that any such schools 
are so ordered as not to be likely to attain those good ends proposed, they shall lay 
the state thereof before this assembly, who shall give such orders thereupon as they 
shall think proper, as by the said act may more fully appear; and whereas the 
erecting of any other schools which are not under the establishment and inspection 
aforesaid may tend to train up youth in ill principles and practices, and introduce 
such disorders as may be of fatal consequences to the public peace and weal of this 
colony; which to prevent, 
Be it enacted, That no particular persons whatsoever shall presume of themselves 
to erect, establish, set up, keep, or maintain any college, seminary of learning, or 
any public school whatsoever, for the instruction of young persons, other than such 
as are erected and established, or allowed by the laws of this colony, without 
special license or liberty first had and obtained of this assembly. And be it enacted 
by the authority aforesaid, That if any person shall presume to act as master, tutor, 
teacher, or instructor in any unlawful school or seminary of learning, erected as 
aforesaid, he shall suffer the penalty of £5, lawful money, per month, for every 
month he shall continue to act as aforesaid, and every grand jury within any county 
where such school or seminary of learning is erected shall make presentment of all 
breaches of this act to the next assistant justice of the peace or county court. And 
be it further enacted, §c., That the civil authority and selectmen in each town, or 
the major part of them, shall inspect and visit all such unlawful schools or semi- 
naries of learning erected as aforesaid, and shall proceed with all such scholars,’ 
students, or residents in such school, and all such as harbor, board, or entertain 
them, according to the laws of this colony respecting transient persons or inmates 
residing in any town without the approbation of the selectmen. And be it further 
enacted, §c., That if any student or resident in such school shall pretend that he is 
bound as by indenture an apprentice to learn any manual art or trade, and the said 
civil authority or selectmen shall suspect that such indenture was given only asa 
color to reside in said town contrary tolaw, that then it shall be in the power of the 
said civil authority or sclectmen to examine all such parties to such indenture under 
oath, in all such questions which they shall think proper, relating to the true inten- 
tion of such indenture and their practice thereon; and if it shall appear to the said 
authority or selectmen, or the major part of them, that such indenture was given 
upon a fraudulent design, as aforesaid, that then such authority shall proceed as if 
no such indenture had been made. And be it further enacted, §:c., That no person 
that has not been educated or graduated in Yale College, or Harvard College in 
Cambridge, or some other allowed foreign Protestant college or university, shall 
take the benefit of the laws of this government respecting the settlement and sup- 
port of ministers. Always provided, That nothing in this act be construed to forbid 
or prevent any society, allowed by law in this colony, to keep a school, by a major 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1251 
vote in such society, to order more parish schools than one to be kept therein, and 
appoint the school or schools to be kept in more places than one in such society. 
This act to continue in force for four years. 
The Revised Statutes of 1750 contained an act relative to schools 
which Dr. Barnard thus summarizes: 
1. Every town where there is but 1 ecclesiastical society, and having 
70 householders and upward, and every ecclesiastical society having 
that number of families, shall maintain at least 1 good school for eleven 
months in the year, by a master sufficiently and suitably qualified. 
2. Every town and society with less than 70 families shall maintain 
a school and schoolmaster for one-half of each year. 
3. Every head county town shall maintain a grammar school, to 
be steadily kept by “some discreet person of good conversation, well 
skilled in and acquainted with the learned languages, especially Greek 
and Latin.” 
4. In the encouragement and maintenance of these schools the 
treasurer of the colony shall deliver annually the sum of 40s. upon 
every £1,000 in the lists of each town, or the same shall be paid into 
the treasury to the school committee of the town or parish, or for want 
of such committee to the selectmen, to be by them applied for the 
benefit of schools in the said town or parish; provided the schools 
have been kept for the year previous according to law. 
5. The local school funds created out of the avails of the sale of the 
7 western townships, according to the act of 1733, and distributed 
among the several towns and societies, are to remain a perpetual fund 
for the support of schools, and for any application of the interest to 
other purposes the principal was to be paid back into the treasury of 
the colony, and the town was to lose the benefit thereof afterwards. 
6. In the case of any deficiency in the means of supporting a school 
according to law, derived from the general tax or local funds, the sum 
required shall be made up, one-half by a tax on the property of the 
town or society, and the other half by a tuition or rate bill, to be paid 
by the parents or guardians of the children at school, unless the town 
or society agree on some other mode. 
7. The majority of the legal voters of every town and society are 
clothed with full power to lay taxes and make all lawful agreements 
for the support and management of the school. 
8. The civil authority and selectmen are constituted inspectors or 
visitors, and directed to visit and inspect all schools established under 
this act at least once a quarter, and inquire particularly into the quali- 
fications of the masters, the proficiency of the pupils, and give such 
directions as they judge needful to render such schools most service- 
able for the increase of knowledge, religion, and good manners. They 
were also instructed to report to the general assembly any disorders 
‘or misapplication of public moneys. : 
9. The selectmen of cach town, when there was but one ecclesiastical 
society, and a committee for each society when there were more than
-P-A-G-E-34

one, are empowered to manage all lands and funds belonging to the 
town or society for the benefit of schools. 
Interest in the cause of education embraced the poor Indian. The 
earliest legislation in the colony respecting the subject is the following, 
found in the Connecticut code of 1650: 
This court, judging it necessary that some means should be used to convey the 
light and knowledge of God and of His word to the Indians and natives among 
us, do order that one of the teaching elders of the churches in this jurisdiction, with 
the help of Thomas Stanton, shall be desired, twice at least in every year, to go 
amongst the neighboring Indians and endeavor to make known to them the counsels 
of the Lord, and thereby to draw and stir them up to direct and order all their ways 
and conversations according to the rule of His word; and Mr. Governor and Mr. 
Deputy, and the other magistrates are desired to take care to see the thing attended, 
and with their own presence, so far as may be convenient, encourage the same. 
In 1654 the court— 
being earnestly desirous to promote and further, what lies in them, a work of that 
nature, wherein the glory of God and the everlasting wellfare of those poor, lost, 
naked sons of Adam is so deeply concerned, do order, that Thomas Mynor, of Pequot, 
shall be wrote unto from this court and desired that he would forthwith send his 
son, John Mynor, to Hartford, where this court will provide for his maintenance and 
schooling, to the end he may be for the present assistant to such elders or others as 
this court shall appoint to interpret the things of God to them as he shall be 
directed, and in the mean time fit himself to be instrumentil in that way, as God 
shall fit and incline him thereto for the future. 
In 1727 all masters and mistresses of Indian children were ordered to 
teach them to read English, and also to instruct them in the principles 
of the Christian faith. Numerous voluntary efforts to educate and 
convert the savages are on record. The most notable of these was the 
effort inaugurated by Rey. Mr. Wheelock at Lebanon, in 1764, to edu- 
cate native teachers and preachers. This school, removed to Hanover, 
N. H., 1770, became Dartmouth College. 
Many other documents of a similar character could be transcribed. 
These, however, will amply suffice to show the extraordinary amount 
of educational activity that there was in the commonwealth within the 
period covered, at least so far as such activity can be measured by leg- 
islative records. However, a change for the worse came in with the 
second half of the eighteenth century. 
Originally in Connecticut, as in the other New England States, the 
town and the parish or church society were coextensive. The town 
was the civil side and the church the ecclesiastical side of the same 
community. The town was incorporated and was the ultimate unit of 
political organization. But some of the towns were so large that, as 
the outer parts became oceupied and population increased in numbers, 
many people found themselves at an inconvenient distance from the 
place of worship. To meet this emergency towns were sometimes 
divided, but more commonly new church societies or parishes, for reli- 
gious purposes only, were established within the limits of the old incor- 
porated towns. Ina State where religion and education were so closely
-P-A-G-E-35
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1253 
drawn together, the creation of new churches involved the establish- 
ment of new schools supported by the public funds. In 1766 towns 
and societies were authorized— 
To divide themselves into proper and necessary districts for keeping their schools, 
and to alter and regulate the same, from time to time, as they shall have occasion; 
which districts shall draw their equal proportion of all public monies belonging to 
such towns and societies according to the list of each respective district therein. 
“By the practical operation of this act,” says Dr. Barnard, “the 
school system of Connecticut, instead of embracing schools of different 
grades, was gradually narrowed down to a single district school, taught 
by one teacher in the summer and a different teacher in the winter, for 
children of all ages and in every variety of study residing within cer- 
tain territorial limits.” 
In 1794 school districts were authorized, by a vote of two-thirds of 
all qualified voters, passed at a meeting called for that purpose, to lay 
a tax to build a schoolhouse, and to locate the same, and to choose a 
collector. An act passed in 1795 authorized “all the inhabitants 
living within the limits of the located societies, who by law have or 
may have a right to vote in town meetings,” to meet in the month of 
October annually and organize themselves into societies conformably 
to law, ‘and transact any other business on the subject of schooling 
in general, and touching the moneys hereby appropriated to their use 
in particular according to law.” 
An act passed in 1798 substituted for the town—“ the old recognized 
agency, through which the regularly settled and approved inhabitants 
first commenced the system of common schools and had for a century 
and a half maintained a teacher for a period in each year in no 
case less than six months, and in a majority of instances for eleven 
months”—a new corporate body, first provided for in 1795, and known 
after 1798 as a school society, ‘‘ with territorial limits sometimes coex- 
tensive with a town, in some cases embracing part of a town, and in 
other parts of two or more towns.” “For a time,” says Dr. Barnard, 
“the effect of this change was not apparent, but coupled with a 
change in the mode of supporting schools, provided for about this 
time by public funds, and dispensing with the obligation of raising 
money by tax, the results were disastrous.” Virtually it was the sub- 
stitution of what is now known as the district system for the town 
system, or the township system, as would be said in the West. Each 
society appointed a suitable number of persons, not exceeding 9, to be 
overseers or visitors of schools, with power to examine and certificate 
teachers, and in general to manage the schools. 
The Latin or Grammar schools now ceased to be obligatory, but 
every school society might, by a vote of two-thirds of the inhabitants 
present in any legally held meeting, establish a high school for the 
common benefit of all the inhabitants, “the object of which shall be 
to perfect the youth admitted therein in reading and penmanship, to
-P-A-G-E-36
1254 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. - 
instruct them in the rudiments of English grammar, in composition, 
in arithmetic and geography, or, on particular desire, in the Latin and 
‘Greek languages, also in the first principles of religion and morality, 
and in general to form them for usefulness and happiness in the 
various relations of social life.” 
In 1799 the powers of the school districts were more clearly defined, 
and at the same time the school societies were given larger powers over 
them. The character of the school society is more closely indicated 
by the following code and regulations for the schools in Farmington, 
adopted in 1796. It now appears that the society was neither a town 
nor a parish, but an independent political unit existing for an educa- 
tional purpose. 
Voted the following regulations for schools in the first society of Farmington: 
1. There shall be appointed in the meeting of the school society a suitable num- 
ber, not exceeding nine, of discrete persons of competent skill in letters and science, 
to the overseers of all the schools in said society, during tlie pleasure of the society, 
and to exercise the powers and perform the duties hereinafter described, which over- 
seers shall meet the first Monday of October, November, and December annually, and 
oftener if they think proper. 
2. The district committee in the several school districts shall in no case contract 
with any person to keep a school within any such district without the consent and 
approbation of the overseers, or a major part of them, in a regular meeting of the 
said overseers first had or obtained. 
3. The overseers will take care that no persons be employed as schoolmasters in 
the society except such as have a thorough acquaintance with the best mode of 
instructing children in spelling and reading the English language, in-the principles 
of English grammar, and in a good handwriting, and who are persons of reputation 
and good moral character. 
4, Ibis expected that the overseers will introduce into schools, besides Webster’s 
Tnstitute in all its parts, as great a variety of reading, both in prose and verse, as the 
circumstances of the people will admit; among these Dwight’s Geography, by ques- 
tion and answer, for its cheapness and simplicity, would be highly proper as an easy 
introduction to that branch of science; and common newspapers would be of great 
use; also see that the Bible is statedly read by those forms who are capable of it, at 
least as the closing exercise in the afternoon, and with marks of reverence and respect 
as the word of God, and that the master of the respective schools close the whole at 
night with prayer. 
5. It shall be the duty of the overseers, at least two of them together, to visit all 
the schools in the society quarterly or oftener, if they think proper, to take notice 
of the proficiency of the scholars, and to excite in them a laudable emulation; and 
they will from time to time give such general or special rules or directions, not 
inconsistent with these regulations, as they shall think proper, with regard to the 
  mode of instructing and governing the schools, so as best to improve the children in . 
letters, in morals, and in manners; and if they judge fit they may, at the expense of 
the society, distribute small premiums of trifling value to such as they shall find, by 
their own observations or by information of the masters, to excel in either of the 
aforesaid respects, or to enable the master himself to do it, as they shall think best; 
and the said overseers will, at their discretion, from time to time, appoint public 
exercises for such of the children in the several schools as may have made the best 
proficiency either in reading, spelling, speaking, rehearsing, composing, or such like 
exercises, either in the schools separately or in a general meeting, and confer on such 
as most deserve it some honorary mark of distinction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1255 
6. In addition to the separate districts which are or may be made the society shall 
be one entire district, for the purpose of maintaining and supporting a school for 
the further instruction of those children and youth of both sexes who have passed 
through the ordinary course of learning in the common schools, to be kept near the 
center of the society, which school shall be under the superinténdency and direction 
of the aforesaid overseers in the same manner as the common schools are. The 
object of the said school shall be to perfect the youth admitted therein in reading 
and in the grammar of the English tongue, and to instruct them in geography, 
arithmetic, composition, and spe paling, or any of them; also in the whole course of 
instruction to impress their minds with a just sense of their duty to God, to their 
parents and instructors, to one anotHer, and to society, and in general to prepare 
them to act well in the various relations of social life. Tho directions for reading 
the Bible and prayer in the common schools shall equally apply to this. 
7. No youth shall be admitted as a pupil in the said school unless such youth is 
accurate in a good degree in spelling and reading the English tongue, and has 
acquired a good handwriting, and has attained to such maturity in years and under- 
standing as to be able with profit to pursue the course of learning taught in said 
school, and upon examination before the major part of the said overseers shall be 
by them judged qualified for admission. And if a greater number of pupils shall 
be admitted than can well be accommodated or instructed, in the judgment of the 
overseers, in such case they shall limit the number who shall attend at a time, and 
direct all the pupils, in a certain order of rotation, by them epost’, to attend the 
school, so as all may have an equal benefit. | 
8. That the powers and duties of the overseers with respect to said school, rela- 
tive to the appointment of the master, relative to the instruction and government 
thereof, relative to its visitation, encouragement, and public exercises, shall be the 
same as in respect to common schools. 
9. The said school shall from time to time draw its share of all the public moneys 
appropriated to the use of schools within the society, to be made up out of the 
shares of the respective districts, according to the number of pupils in such school 
from such districts, when compared with the number of children, such districts 
computing from four to fourteen years of age. 
Similar regulations were adopted in other towns. 
Dr. Barnard takes leave of his subject in the following paragraph: 
In closing this important period of our school history it may be well to repeat 
that up to 1798 the law enforced the keeping of school in towns or societies of more 
than 70 families for eleven months of the year, and in those of less than seventy, 
for at least one-half the year. It also enforced the keeping of a grammar school in 
the head town of the several counties. It imposed a tax, collectible with other 
public taxes, for the support of schools, and limited its benefits to such towns or 
societies as kept their schools according to law. There are no official documents 
respecting the condition of the schools themselves, but from the testimony of men 
who were educated in the common schools prior to 1800 it appears that the course 
of instruction was limited to spelling, reading, writing, and the elements of arith- 
metic, but that these studies were attended to by all the people of the State; so 
that it was rare to find a native of Connecticut ‘who could not read the Holy Word 
ot God and the good laws of the State.” These schools, such as they were, were 
the main reliance of the whole community for the above studies. There were but 
few private schools, except to fit young men for college, or carry them forward in 
the higher branches of an English education. The books used were few and imper- 
fect, but uniform. The supervision of the schools by the selectmen was considered 
a part of their town office, and by the clergy as a regular part of their parochial 
duty. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
    1256 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Down toa half century ago Connecticut men boasted that theirs was 
the best educated commonwealth in the Union. Dr. Jedediah Morse 
wrote in 1797: “A thirst for learning prevails among all ranks of peo- 
ple in the State. Moreof the young men of Connecticut, in proportion 
to their numbers, receive a public education than in any of the States.”! 
And Dr. Horace Bushnell said in 1851: “The late Hon. James Hill- 
house, when he was in Congress, ascertained that 47 of the members, 
or about one-fifth of the whole number in both Houses, were native- 
born sons of Connecticut. Mr. Calhoun assured one of our Represent- 
atives, when upon the floor of the House with him, that he had seen 
. the time when the natives of Connecticut, together with the graduates 
of Yale College there collected, wanted only 5 of being a majority of 
that body.”? The present Commissioner of Education, himself a Con- 
necticut born and educated man, has said: “Before 1837 Connecticut 
surpassed the other States in the education of its people.”®

1. Preliminary history, including an act establishing funds for the support of the min- 
istry and schools of education, passed in 1793.—2. An act appropriating the moneys 
which shall arise on the sale of the Western lands belonging to this State, passed 1795.— 
8, Subsequent history of the fund. 
Connecticut was the first of the States to establish a permanent com- 
mon school fund. This was done in 1795; New York did not take her 
first step in that direction until 1805, and Massachusetts not until 
1834. The national land ordinance of 1785 had dedicated one thirty- 
sixth part of the Western territory, then in possession of the Govern- 
ment, to common schools, and the contracts for lands made with the 
Ohio Company of Associates and Judge Symmes in 1787 confirmed the 
dedication so far as their sales were concerned; but this was the 
extreme point that the development of the national policy reached until 
1802. Again the Connecticut fund became available for school pur- 
poses in 1799, while no Western State derived any immediate advantage 
from its school lands until some years after that time. These facts 
give to the history of the Connecticut fund a peculiar interest. 
‘When Connecticut made her cession of Western lands to the General 
Government in May, 1786, she retained or reserved the territory bounded 
as follows: North by the international boundary; east by Pennsyl- 
vania; south by the forty-first parallel of north latitude; west by a 
line parallel to the western boundary of Pennsylvania and distant from 
it 120 miles. The disposition to be made of the territory reserved, 
known in history as the “Connecticut Western Reserve,” “ New Con- 
necticut,” and the “Western Reserve,” embracing between 3,000,000

and 4,000,000 acres, became immediately a State question, that con- 
tinued to attract attention for the nine ensuing years. An act was 
passed in October, 1786, authorizing the sale of a portion of the lands. 
This act gave 500 acres of good land in every town (5 miles square) to 
the public for the support of the gospel ministry, the same_quantity 
for the support of schools, and 240 acres in fee simple to the first gospel © 
minister who should settle in the township. But the sale of only 24,000 
acres was made in pursuance of this legislation.’ In 1792 the general 
assembly gaye 500,000 acres, lying across the western end of the ter- 
ritory, to the citizens of eight enumerated Connecticut towns, who had 
suftered loss of property in the Revolution from the numerous expe- 
ditions of the British into the State. 
In October, 1793, tLe assembly created a committee of eight persons, 
whom it authorized to sell the remaining lands on certain specified 
terms and conditions, and at the same time took the following action: 
AN ACT establishing funds for the support of the ministry and schools of education. 
Be it enacted, §c., That the monies arising from the sale of the territory belonging 
to this State, lying west of the State of Pennsylvania, be, and the same is hereby, 
established a perpetual fund, the interest whereof is granted and shall be appro- 
priated to the use and benefit of the several ecclesiastical societies, churches, or con- 
gregations of all denominations in this State, to be by them applied to the support 
of their respective ministers or preachers of the gospel and schools of education, 
under such rules and regulations as shall be adopted by this or some future session 
of the general assembly. 
An earlier proposition was to devote the funds wholly to the gospel 
ministry. 
This act was not passed without strong opposition in the assembly. 
Its passage led at once to a widespread, spirited, and even acrimonious 
discussion, in which the press, the pulpit, the platform, the town meeting, 
and the legislature all participated. The points of attack were several, 
as that the act had been hastily passed, without due consideration; 
that there was no need of disposing of the proceeds of the lands until 
they had been first sold; that the proceeds could be put to a better use, 
as paying off the State debt, improving the roads, and promoting agri- 
culture and internal improvement; that the funds should be wholly 
devoted to education; that they should be given to Yale College; and 
especially that it was improper and invidious to put the interest of the 
accruing fund at the disposal of the ecclesiastical societies for the pur- 
poses named. 
In the section of this chapter devoted to school legislation in Con- 
necticut the relation of ecclesiastical societies to public education at 
that time has been pointed out. Here it is sufficient to say that there 
was a strong anti-church feeling in the State, and, moreover, that the 
church, or religious influence, was sharply divided into the congrega- 
Made to Gen. S. H. Parsons, and lying on the Mahoning River. See Hist. Coll. Mahoning Valley, 
Vol. I, pp. 149-151.

tional, orthodox, or established church, and the heterodox or non-estab- 
lished interest, consisting of various dissenting bodies. The regular 
clergy were strongly assailed, charged with exerting an undue influence 
in public affairs, and particularly with having: influenced or procured 
this particular act of legislation. For example, the inhabitants of 
Cheshire, legally assembled in town meeting on the second Friday of 
December, 1794, voted, among other things: 
We also believe the same appropriation to be an introductory step toward estab- 
lishing a certain and permanent civil provision for a certain and permanent sacerdo- 
tal order; a provision which, in other ages and nations, has gone forward and pro- 
claimed that the downfall of liberty and pure religion was hastening after, and of 
course a provision against which the experience of ages admonished us to guard 
with a jealous eye. 
The same line of attack is followed by a writer in the American Tele- 
graph, Newfield, May 27, 1795, who propounds the following questions: 
(1) For what purpose does the State pay from two to three hundred dollars 
annually for refreshing and dining the clergy who assemble at elections? 
(2) What part of their official duty calls them there? 
(3) Whether the spiritual good of inen are the objects of their greatest good on 
such occasions? 
(4) Whether an order of men, exempt from all public taxes, and profoundly 
devoted to the service of the altar, intermeddling in the affairs of government, and 
in continual progression extending and advancing their secret influence in every 
department of the State, is not a growing and dangerous aristocracy? 
(5) Whether the extraordinary and unprecedented exertion of the clergy to effect 
a measure of government in their own favor against the will of the people is not 
' sufficient to excite suspicion and even to cause universal alarm? 
Various propositions to repeal the act or to modify it were intro- 
duced into the assembly from time to time. In the mean time the 
lands were not sold. At its May session, 1795, the assembly passed a 
new act making new terms of sale, and the same day put an end to the 
heated controversy in relation to the destination of the proceeds by 
passing the following act, which created the State school fund: 
AN ACT appropriating the monies which shall arise on the sale of the Western lands belonging to 
this State. 
1. Be it enacted, §c., That the principal sum which shall be received on the sale of 
the lands belonging to this State lying west of Pennsylvania shall be and remain a 
perpetual fund for the purposes hereafter mentioned in this act, to be loaned or other- 
wise improved for these purposes as the general assembly shall direct, and the inter- 
est arising therefrom shall be, and hereby is, appropriated to the support of schools 
in the several societies constituted, or which may be constituted, by law within cer- 
tain local bounds within this State, to be kept according to the provisions of law 
which shall from time to time be made, and to no other use or purpose whatsoever, 
except in the case and under the circumstances hereafter mentioned in this act. 
2. Beit further cnacted, That the said interest, as it shall become due from time to 
time, shall be paid over to the said societies in their capacity of school societies 
according to the list of polls and ratable estate of such societies respectively, which 
shall, when such payment shall be made, have been last perfected. 
3. Provided nevertheless and be it further enacted, That whenever such society shall, 
pursuant to a vote of such society, passed in a legal meeting, warned for that pur-

pose only, in which vote two-thirds of the legal voters present in such meeting shall 
concur, apply to the general assembly requesting liberty to improve their proportion 
of said interest, or any part thereof, for the support of the Christian ministry, or the 
public worship of God, the general assembly shall have full power to grant such 
request during their pleasure; and in case of any such grant, the school society 
shall pay over the amount so granted to the religious societies, churches, or congre- 
gations of all denominations of Christians within its limits, to be proportioned to 
such societies according to the lists of their respective inhabitants or members, 
which, shall, when such payment shall from time to time be made, have been last 
perfected; and in case there shall be in such school society any individuals compos- 
ing a part only of any such religious society, church, or congregation, then the pro- 
portion of such individuals shall be paid to the order of the body to which they 
belong by the rule aforesaid, and the monies of such individuals shall be discounted 
from their ministerial taxes or contributions, and im that way inure to their exclu- 
sive benefit, and the monies so paid over shall be applied to the purposes of the 
grant, and to no other whatsoever. 
4, Be it further enacted, That if any society, church, or congregation shall apply 
any of the aforesaid monies to any other use or purpose than those to which they 
shall or may have a right to apply them pursuant to this act, such society, church, 
or congregation shall forfeit and pay a sum equal to that so misapplied to the pub- 
lic treasury of this State. 
5. Be it further enacted, That all the inhabitants living within the limits of the 
located societies who by law have, or may have, a right to vote in town meetings, 
shall meet some time in the month of October annually, in the way and manner pre- 
scribed in the statute entitled, ‘‘An act for forming, ordering, and regulating soci- 
eties,” and, being so met, shall exercise the powers given in, and by said act, in 
organizing themselves and in appointing the necessary officers, as herein directed, 
for the year ensuing, and may transact any other business on the subject of school- 
ing in general, and touching the monies hereby appropriated to their use in partic- 
ular, according to law, and shall have power to adjourn from time to time, as they 
shall think proper. 
6. Be it further enacted, That the inhabitants or members of the several religious 
societies, churches, or congregations aforesaid, who have the right by law to vote in 
their respective mectings on the subject of the ministry and the public worship of 
‘God, shall assemble themselves some time in the month of December annually, or at 
‘such other time as they shall judge convenient, and may organize themselves and 
‘appoint the necessary officers as in said act is directed, all in the way and manner 
jtherein prescribed, with power to adjourn from time to time, as they may think 
‘proper, and in any of their said meetings they shall have power to transact any 
business relating to the ministry and the public worship of God according to law, 
but shall have no power to act on the subject of schooling, any law, usage, or cus- 
tom to the contrary notwithstanding. 
7. Be it further enacted, That an act passed Oct., 1793, entitled, “An act for the 
establishing a fund for the support of the gospel ministry and schools of education” 
be, and the same is hereby, repealed. 
October 14, 1795, the committee appointed to sell the lands reported 
to the assembly that it had effected a sale for $1,200,000. Somie further 
points relating to the history of the fund may be found in the follow- 
ing summary: 
The first apportionment of the income among the school societies was 
made in 1799. The interest had been allowed to aecumulate, and 
amounted in March, 1799, to $60,403.78. In March, 1800, the dividends 
were $23,651. Up to this date the fund had been managed by the com-
-P-A-G-E-42
  1260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
mittee that negotiated the sale; but in 1800 the management was 
intrusted to a committee or board of managers, 4 in number. In the 
course of thirteen years the interest divided and paid out to the socic- 
ties amounted to $456,757.44, being an average of $35,135.18 per annum. 
In 1809, at the October session, it appeared from the report of the 
managers that a large amount of interest was unpaid, and that the 
collateral securities of the original debts were not safe. In view of 
these facts a committee of the legislature recommended that the man- 
agement of the fund should be intrusted to one person, and that effi- 
cient measures should be adopted to save the capital as well as interest 
from loss. In 1810, at the May session, the Hon. James Hillhouse, then 
a member of the United States Senate, was appointed sole commis- 
sioner of the school fund. Mr. Hillhouse immediately resigned his post 
in the Senate and entered on the duties of his new office. He found 
that the capital consisted chiefly of the debts due from the original 
purchasers of the Western Reserve and the substituted securities 
which had been accepted in their stead. These securities had in the 
course of fifteen years, by death, insolvency, and otherwise, become 
involved in complicated difficulties. The interest had fallen greatly in 
arrears, and in many cases nearly equaled the principal. The debtors 
were dispersed in different States. Without a single litigated suit, or 
a dollar paid for counsel, he reduced the disordered management to an 
efficient system, disentangled its affairs from loose and embarrassed 
connections with personal securities and indebted estates, rendered it 
productive of a large, regular, and increasing dividend, and converted 
its doubtful claims into well-secured and solid capital. During the 
fifteen years of his administration the annual dividend averaged 
$52,061.35, and the capital was augmented to $1,719,434.24, The amount 
of the interest that he divided was $780,920.24, which, added to the sum 
of $456,757.44, previously divided, made an aggregate of $1,237,677.68. 
The policy thus inaugurated by Mr, Hillhouse was continued by his 
successor, Hon. Seth P. Beers, who was appointed commissioner in 
1825, and held the office till May, 1849, when he resigned. During his 
administration, by judicious sales and management of lands which 
came into his possession as forfeited securities, the capital of the fund 
was increased from $1,719,434.24 to $2,049,482.32; and the income from 
$72,418.30 to $133,366.50, being an average of $97,815.15 per annum. 
From 1849 to 1859 there were six different commissioners, but no change 
followed in the management or prosperity of the fund—the productive 
capital of which, according to the report of Hon. Albert Sedgwick, dated 
April 16, 1859, amounted to $2,043,372.01, yielding an income for the 
year of $142,303.42, or $1.30 for the benefit of each child in the State 
between the ages of 4 and 16. The entire income of the fund from 
1799 to 1859 amounted to $4,940,988.29, besides paying the expense of 
its management, ‘ We know not in the whole history of public funds 
or trust estates,” says Dr. Barnard, ‘“‘ another instance so creditable to

the economy, fidelity, and practical judgment of the persons intrusted 
with its management for a period of sixty years.”. The Connecticut 
State Report for 1890 gave the fund as $2,023,753.83,

I. PENN’S COLONY. 
Next to Massachusetts and Connecticut there was more educational 
activity of the kind that leaves traces in the statute book in Pennsyl- 
vania than in any other State. No other State had such a diversified 
and incongruous population; this may be divided in general into three 
groups—the Quakers, the German colonists, and the Connecticut set- 
tlersin Wyoming. Dr. J.P. Wickersham deals with these groups and 
with the whole subject very comprehensively in his History of Educa- 
tion in Pennsylvania, Private and Public, Elementary and Higher, from 
the time the Swedes Settled on the Delaware to the Present Day. (See 
Chaps. I, III, IV.) : 
The Quakers and the Connecticut men alone furnish material for our 
inquiry. 
The characteristic religious tenet of the Quakers, who founded the 
Commonwealth, is faith in individual inspiration, or the doctrine of the 
inner light. “The mystery of the incarnation does not puzzle the 
_ Quaker,” says the author just mentioned; “as he believes that God
-P-A-G-E-44
  1262 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
is in some measure incarnate in every soul that breathes, he readily 
rises to the conception of a soul completely filled with the divine 
influence, the God-man.” 
Evidently such a faith as this may affect education in either one of 
two ways. It is likely to fill narrow and "ignorant minds with such a 
sense of their present sufficiency as will prove a serious bar to schools, 
to study, and to mental cultivation; while it is lixely to inspire the 
broad-minded and the intelligent with high ideals and to energize them 
to make strenuous efforts. Fortunately the Quakers, for the most 
part, have illustrated the second of these tendencies. With his “view 
of the possibilities of human nature,” says Dr. Wickersham, the 
Quaker “deems it his duty to make himself, body and mind, a fit 
temple for the indwelling of the Divine Spirit. Hence, to be con- 
sistent with himself, he must be a friend to all art that purifies and 
ennobles, to all science that broadens and enriches, and to all educa- 
tion that instructs, develops, and perfects. If at any time the Society 
of Friends, or its individual members, have seemed to discourage educa- 
tion, is was either because the logic of their religious doctrines was 
not fully understood, or because they feared the effect of that abuse of 
learning which ‘puffeth up,’ magnifies self, and in its self-importance 
refuses to give heed to the humble teachings of the ‘still small voice’ 
in the soul.” (Pp. 24-23.) 
William Penn was a liberally educated as well asa broad-minded 
man. He shared to the full the most enlightened sentiments of the 
society to which he belonged. Liberal extracts could be made from 
his writings showing that in respect to education he was far in advance 
of his time. Just before leaving England for America Penn wrote 
to his wife as follows about the education of his own children: 
For their learning be liberal; spare no cost; for by such parsimony all is lost 
that is saved; but let it be useful knowledge, such as is consistent with truth and 
godliness, not cherishing a vain conversation or idle mind; but ingenuity mixed with 
industry is good for the body and mind too. I recommend the useful parts of math- 
ematics, as building houses or ships, measuring, surveying, dialling, navigation; 
but agriculture is especially in my eye. Let my children be husbandmen and house- 
wives; it is industrious, healthy, honest, and of good example. 
At alater day he wrote concerning his American province: 
Upon the whole-matter I undertake to say that if we would preserve our Govern- 
ment we must endear it to the people. To do this, besides the necessity of present- 
ing just and wise things, we must secure the youth; this is not to be done but by 
the amendment of the way of education, and that with all convenient speed and 
diligence. I say the Government is highly obliged; it is a sort of trustee for the 
youth of the Kingdom, who, though minors, yet will have the Government when we 
are gone. Therefore, depress vice and cherish virtue, that through good education 
they may become good, which will truly render them happy in this world and a 
good way fitted for that which is to come. If this is done, they will owe more to 
your memories for their education than for their estates.
-P-A-G-E-45
  ; AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1263 
Naturally, therefore, in the frame of government or charter that he 
drew up for his colony, written in England early in 1682, he made pro- 
vision for education as follows: 
Twelfth. That the governor and provincial council shall erect and order all public 
‘schools and encourage and reward the authors of useful sciences and laudable inven- 
tions in the said province. * * * 
And, fourthly, a committee of manners, education, and arts, that all wicked and 
scandalous living may be prevented, and that youth may be successively trained up 
in virtue and useful knowledge and arts. 
The following also was one of the laws agreed upon in England: 
Twenty-cighth. That all children within this province of the age of twelve years 
shall be taught some useful trade or skill, to the end none may be idle; but the poor 
may work to live, and the rich, if they become poor, may not want. 
These provisions were duly accepted by the colony. Moreover on 
December 4, 1682, the first general assembly of the colony sat at Ches- 
ter. Chapter LX of the “Great Law” that it enacted contained this 
provision with respect to education: 
That the laws of this province from time to time shall be published and printed, 
that every person may have the knowledge thereof; and they shall be one of the 
books taught in the schools of this province and territories thereof. 
The frame granted to the colony in 1683 contained a provision 
relating to education not found in that of the previous year. After 
stipulating that the governor and provincial council shall erect and 
order all public schools it proceeds— : 
That one-third part of the provincial council, residing with the governor, from 
time to time shall, with the governor, have the care of the management of public 
affairs relating to the peace, justice, treasury, and improvement of the province and 
territories, and to the good education of youth, and sobriety of the manners of the 
inhabitants therein as aforesaid. 
Chapter CXII of the laws enacted by the second assembly, which 
sat in Philadelphia March 10 of the same year, reads as follows: 
And to the end that poor as well as rich may be instructed in good and com- 
mendable learning, which is to be preferred before wealth— 
Be it enacted, ete., That all persons in this province and territories thereof, having 
children, and all the guardians and trustees of orphans, shall cause such to be 
instructed in reading and writing, so that they may be able to read the Scriptures 
and to write by the time they attain to twelve years of age; and that then they be 
taught some useful trade or skill, that the poor may work to live, and the rich, if 
they become poor, may not want; of which every county court shall take care. And 
in case such parents, guardians, or overseers shall be found deficient in this respect, 
every such parent, guardian, or overseer shall pay for every such child five pounds, 
except there should appear an incapacity in body or understanding to hinder it. 
This was providing (1) that all children should be taught to read and 
write by the time that they were 12 years of age; (2) that they should 
be taught some useful trade or skill; and (3) that compulsion should 
be resorted to if necessary in order to accomplish universal education. 
For some reason this law, so far in advance of the ideas then current, 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
      1264 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
was disapproved of by William and Mary, but it was reeracted by 
the governor and assembly in 1793. Dr. Wickersham thinks that it 
became a dead letter, because it was omitted from subsequent frames 
of government. He supposes, however, that it was enforced for a 
time, and refers to the records of the early courts for proof. The 
following entry is one of many that might be quoted: 
At a court of quarter sessions held at Chester, for said county, en the twenty-third 
day of the 12th mo., 1702-3, Robert Sinkler petitioned this court that his present 
master John Crosby was to teach him to read and write, which he hath not freely 
performed, ordered that John Crosby put the said servant to school one month, and 
to instruct his said servant another month. 
The frame of government granted by Governor Markham, 1696, con- 
tained the following provisions: 
That the governor and council shall erect and order all public schools and encour- 
age and reward the authors of useful sciences and laudable inventions in the said 
province and territories. 
That the governor and council shall from time to time have the care of, the manage- 
ment of, all public affairs relating to the peace, safety, justice, treasury, trade, and 
improvement of the province and territories, and to the good education of youth, 
and sobriety of the manners of the inhabitants therein as aforesaid. 
That the provincial authorities were not slow to take practical action 
is shown by these records: 
At a Council held at Philadelphia, ye 26th of ye 10th month, 1683, Present: Wm. 
Penn, Propor & Govr., Theo. Holmes, Wm. Haigue, Lasse Cock, Wm. Clayton. 
The Goyr and Proyll Councill having taken into their Serious Consideration the 
great Necessity there is of a School Master for ye instruction & Sober Education of 
youth in the towne of Philadelphia, Sent for Enock flower, an Inhabitant of the said 
towne, who for twenty Year past hath been exercised in that care and Imployment 
in England, to whom haveing Communicated their Minds, he Embraced it upon the 
following Terms: to Learne to read English 4s by the Quarter, to Learne to read and 
write 6s by ye Quarter, to learne to read, Write and Cast accot 88 by ye Quarter; 
for Boarding a Scholler, that is to say, dyet, Washing, Lodging, & Scooling, Tenn 
pounds for one whole year. 
The Friends’ Public Schoolof Philadelphia, now known as the William 
Penn Charter School, dates from 1689. The original name bore the’ 
current English sense of the name public school. The following records 
relate to the master of this school: 
August 1, 1693: Thomas Meaking, keeper of the free school in the town of Phila- 
delphia, being called before the lieutenant governor and council, and told that he 
must not keep school without a license. Answered that he was willing to comply, 
and to take a license. Was therefore ordered to procure a certificate of his ability, 
learning, and diligence from the inhabitants of note in this town by the sixteenth 
‘instant, in order to the obtaining alicense, which he promised to do. 
December, 1699: Thomas Makin voted to be clerk of this assembly, at 4s per 
day. * * * fg 
1705, November 3d: The petition of Thomas Makin, complaining of damage accruing 
to him by the loss of several of his scholars by reason of the assembly’s using the 
school house so long—the weather being very cold—ordered that he be allowed the 
sum of three pounds over and above the sum of twenty shillings this house formerly 
allowed him for the same consideration.

addressed to the governor and council dated December 10, 1697. 
The following qaotation shows the spirit of the document: 
The humble petition of Samuel Carpenter, Edward Shippen, Anthony Morris,. 
James Fox, David Lloyd, William Southby, and John Jones, in the behalf of them-- 
selves and the rest of the people called Quakers who are members of the Monthly 
Meeting, held and kept at the new Meeting-house, lately built upon a piece of 
ground fronting the High street, in Philadelphia aforesaid, obtained of the present 
Governor by the said people, sheweth: That it hath been and is much desired by 
Many, that a school be set up and upheld in this town of Philadelphia, where poor- 
children may be freely maintained, taught and educated in good literature, untik 
they be fit to be put out apprentices or capable to be masters or ushers in the said. 
school. And forasmuch as by the laws and constitutions of this government, it is. 
provided and enacted, that the Governor and Council shall erect and order all pub- 
lic schools, and encourage and reward the authors of useful sciences and laudable. 
inventions, in the said Province and Territories; therefore, may it please the Gov- 
ernor and Council to ordain and establish that at the said town of Philadelphia, a. 
public school may be founded, where all children and servants, male and female, 
whose parents, guardians, and masters be willing to subject them to the rules and 
orders of the said school, shall from time to time, with the approbation of the over- 
thereof for the time being, be received or admitted, taught and instructed; 
the rich at reasonable rates, and the poor to be maintained and schooled for nothing. 
And to that end a meet and convenient house or houses, buildings and rooms, may 
be erected for the keeping of the said school, and for the entertainment and abode. 
of such and so many masters, ushers, mistresses and poor children, as by the order- 
and direction of the said Monthly Meeting shall be limited and appointed from time.

Il. THE WYOMING VALLEY.     
As bounded by the charter of 1662, Connecticut extended westward 
on the parallel of 41° north latitude to the South Sea. Two years later: 
Charles II, author of this charter, gave to his brother James, Duke of 
York, the Dutch province of New Netherlands, thus jumping the Con- 
necticut grant. Moreover, the charter which the same King gave to- 
William.Penn in 1681 bounded Pennsylvania on the north by the- 
beginning of the three and fortieth degree of northern latitude, whicl 
was finally adjudged to mean the forty-second parallel, thus jumping 
Connecticut a whole degree from the Delaware River five degrees west- 
ward. Connecticut yielded to the inevitable in the Hudson Valley ané 
in New Jersey; but in due course of time she prepared to contest with 
Pennsylvania the possession of the overlapped degree beyond the Dela- 
ware. Settlers from Windham County, Conn., began to migrate to the 
Wyoming Valley while the French and Indian war was in progress, 
but permanent settlements were not effected until about 1769. These 
operations were conducted principally under the auspices of the Sus+ 
quehanna Company, which was at first a private affair, but was after- 
wards incorporated and protected by the State. There now ensued a 
most interesting passage in the history of Western colonization, with 
which we are not concerned. In time 17 townships, known in Pennsyl- 
vania history as the “ certified townships,” were surveyed and occupied.

In 1782 a Federal court adjudged the territory in dispute to Pennsyl- 
vania. Up to that time the settlers had been subject to the jurisdiction 
of Connecticut. This first population, subsequently strongly reenforced 
from home, gave to the region in the midst of which it is placed, and in 
fact to the whole State, an educational impress that it has never lost.! 
Dr. Wickersham speaks of the system of free public schools that the 
Connecticut settlers established in the valley of the Wyoming as havy- 
ing an important bearing upon subsequent educational history. Penn- 
sylvania, as a province, he says, of course had nothing to do with 
establishing these schools; in principle they were an advance upon the 
schools then existing in Connecticut, and in most essential respects 
were similar in design and management to the public schools of the 
present day. This influence, as well as the Connecticut man’s alertness 
to education at the time, is well illustrated by the first action in rela- 
tion to schools that was taken, as follows: 
At a meeting of the Susquehanna Company, held at Hartford, Conn., 28th 
December, 1768, it was voted to lay out 5 townships of land within the purchase of 
said company on the Susquehanna of 5 miles square each; that the first 40 settlers 
of the first town settled and 50 settlers of each of the other towns settled shall 
divide the towns among themselves, reserving and appropriating 3 whole shares or 
rights in each township for the public use of a gospel ministry and the schools in 
each of said towns, and also reserving for the use of said company all beds and 
mines of iron ore and coal that may be within said townships. 
It was also voted to grant to Dr. Eleazer Wheelock a tract of land in the easterly 
part of the Susquehanna purchase 10 miles long and 6 miles wide for the use of the 
Indian school under his care: Provided, He shall set up and keep said school on the 
premises, 
The Indian school was not established. Dr. Wheelock became the 
founder of Dartmouth College instead. The other features of the plan 
were speedily carried out. Premising the observation that this inter- 
esting chapter really belongs to the history of education in Connecticut, 
we may permit Dr. Wickersham to tell the story. His account is here 
considerably abridged. 
The 3 shares in each township, amounting to 960 acres, were devoted 
mainly to schools, but in part to the support of the ministry. The funds 
arising from the sale of the lands, as in so many other similar cases, 
were badly managed; but in some townships they still exist and are 
applied to the original purpose. The New England town-meeting plan 
of managing schools and other town affairs was followed. The mode of 
proceeding is thus described: 
A school meeting was called by public notices posted in the district. The inhabit- 
ants of the district met and elected, in their own way, three of their number to act 
as a school committee, which committee hired teachers and exercised a general 
supervision over the schools. The teacher was paid by the patrons of the school in 
proportion to the number of days they had been sent to school. Arate bill was made 
out by the teacher and handed to the committee, who collected the money.

  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1267 
There was also a township fund raised by taxation that was drawn 
_ upon to build schoolhouses and pay teachers. <A local historian has 
disinterred from the old records such minutes as the following: 
At a town meeting held in Wilkesbarre, August 23, 1773, a vote was passed ‘to 
raise three pence on the pound on the district list to keep a free school in the several 
school districtsin the said Wilkesbarre.” A subsequent meeting, ‘especially warned, 
adopted measures for keeping open free schools, one in the upper district, one in the 
lower, and one in the town plot.” (Wickersham, p. 76.) 
A town meeting in Kingston, held December 21, 1773, voted that a 
committee of three, the men being duly named, be appointed to divide 
the town into three districts for keeping of schools. The other town- 
ships passed similar votes, thus recognizing the fundamental principles 
of all true systems of public instruction—the common education of all 
classes, schools supported by a general fund or a tax on property, local 
management and responsibility. 
There appears to have been also a general county educational organiza- 
tion. Thus, at a general mecting of the settlers, held December 6, 1774, 
it was voted that 15 men, duly named, be chosen as a school committee 
for the ensuing year. The Wyoming settlement influenced the educa- 
tional history of the State in three ways: (1) The system of schools first 
established there continued in operation to the time of the adoption of 
the State common school system in 1834, when, with little change and 
no disturbance, it was merged into it; (2) as the nearest approach to 
our modern public schools of any class of schools then known in Penn- 
sylvania, these Connecticut schools exercised considerable influence 
in shaping the school legislation which culminated in the act of 1834; 
(3) it was one of the Wyoming men, Timothy Pickering, so well known 
in our national history, who in the constitutional convention of 1790 
secured the adoption of the article on education upon which was sub- 
sequently based the whole body of laws relating to common schools in 
Pennsylvania up to the year 1834, and by so doing saved the conyen- 
tion from the threatened danger of committing itself to a much nar- 
rower policy.

VI. CONGRESSIONAL LAND GRANTS FOR COMMON SCHOOLS AND 
UNIVERSITIES. 
The land ordinance of May 20, 1785; the ordinance of 1787; Article 1II of compacts; 
powers to the board of treasury, July 23, 1787; enabling act for Ohio, April 80, 1802; 
Ohio school lands vested in the State legislature, March 3, 1803; grant of lands made 
to Michigan for schools, June 23, 1836; act to establish the Territorial government of 
Oregon, August 14, 1848; act to appropriate lands for the support of schools in certain 
townships and fractional townships not before provided for, May 20, 1826; extracts 
from acts appropriating university lands to Michigan, 1826, 1836; provisions of the 
enabling acts for the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washing- 
ton, February 22, 1889; resolutions adopted by the general assembly of Maryland. 
The Government of the United States is one of delegated powers. 
Not only is the Constitution framed on this theory, but the ninth amend- 
ment expressly declares: ‘The powers not delegated to the United 
States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are 
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” Among the 
powers delegated, the establishment of schools and the provision of 
education are not found. The words do not occur in the document. 
Accordingly, whatever power Congress has in the premises must be 
sought in the implications of the Constitution as interpreted by history. 
Propositions relative to the establishment of a national university were 
brought forward in the Federal Convention of 1787, but only to be 
rejected. But while the Constitution confers upon Congress no direct 
power over the subject of education and schools, that body has still 
legislated upon the subject in several different directions. Its earliest 
legislation dedicated public lands to the support of common schools 
and seminaries of learning. 
Gifts of lands for the creation and maintenance of schools and other 
institutions of learning were a well-established practice in Europe and 
in England long before the settlements of Jamestown and Plymouth 
were made, and the American colonies very naturally adopted it. Thus, 
in 1677, the general court of Connecticut voted 600 acres of land forever 
to each of the four couaties of the Commonwealth for the support of 
grammar schools in the county towns. Ata later day the new States 
and the General Government pursued a similar policy. 
At the opening of the Revolutionary war the States of Massachu- 
setts, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, 
and Georgia claimed the whole West north of parallel 31°, extending 
to the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes. These claims the other 
‘States disputed, on the ground that the Western lands must be won from 
a common enemy by common efforts, and that they should therefore 
inure to the common benefit. Time told more and more in favor of 
the nationalization of these lands, and ultimately the claimant States 
ceded the major part of them and the jurisdiction of the whole to the 
nation. The Northwestern cessions were made in the period 1781-1786; 
the Southwestern cessions somewhat later. These cessions threw upon
-P-A-G-E-51
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1269 
Congress the disposition of the Western territory, with the exception of 
Kentucky and Tennessee, its settlement and government. As the War 
of Independence drew to its end, both statesmen and soldiers in the 
Federal Army began to turn their attention to the region northwest of 
the Ohio River as a theater for colonization. In April, 1783, Col. 
Timothy Pickering drew up certain propositions for settling a new 
State by such officers and soldiers of the Federal Army as should asso- 
‘ciate for that purpose, said State to comprise all that part of the North- 
west Territory lying east of the meridian line drawn 30 miles west of 
the mouth of the Scioto River and the Miami of the Lakes [the Mau- 
mee]. Pickering proposed that Congress should purchase this tract of 
the Indians, and then make grants according to a prescribed schedule 
to the officers and men entering into the association. One of these 
propositions contains the first suggestion extant of the future national 
educational land-grant policy, viz: 
7. These rights being secured, all the surplus lands shall be the common property of 
the State, and be disposed of for the common good; as for laying out roads, building 
bridges, creating public buildings, establishing schools and academies, defraying the 
expenses of government, and other public uses. 
This suggestion ripened into legislation two years later: 
AN ORDINANCE for ascertaining the mode of disposing of lands in the Western territory. 
Adopted by Congress May 20, 1785. 
Be it ordained by the United Slales in Congress assembled, That the territory ceded by 
individual States to the United States, which has been purchased of the Indian 
inhabitants, shall be disposed of in the following manner: * * * Thesurveyors, 
as they are respectively qualified, shall proceed to divide the said territory into town- 
ships of 6 miles square, by lines running due north and south, and others crossing 
these at right angles, as near as may be. * * * 
The plats of the townships, respectively, shall be marked by subdivisions into lots 
of one mile square, or 640 acres, in the same direction as the external lines, and num- 
bered from 1 to 36, always beginning the succeeding range of the lots with the num- 
ber next to that with which the preceding one concluded. [That is, beginning in 
the northeast corner and numbering back and forth, west and east.] * * * 
There shall be reserved the lot No. 16 of every township, for the maintenance of 
public schools, within the said township. 
In 1787 the agents of the Ohio Company of Associates, a New Eng- 
land organization that had already projected a colony on the Ohio, 
resorted to Congress for a grant of lands and a constitution of govern- 
ment. This application led at once to two important enactments: 
AN ORDINANCE for the government of the territory of the United States northwest of the River 
Ohio. Adopted by Congress July 13, 1787. Article III of Compacts. 
Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government and the 
happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encour- 
aged. 
Powers to the board of treasury to contract for the sale of the Western territory. Adopted by Con- 
gress July 23, 1787. 
The lot No. 16 in each township, or fractional part of a township, to be given per- 
petually for the purposes contained in the said ordinance [1785]. The lot No. 29, in 
each township, or fractional part of a township, to be given perpetually for the pur- 
poses of religion. * * * Not more than two complete townships to be given 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  1270 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
perpetually for the purpose of a university, to be laid off by the purchaser or pur- 
chasers, as near the center as may be, so that the same shall be of good land, to be 
applied to the intended object by the legislature of the State. 
} These are the powers under which the sale of 1,500,000 acres of land, 
on the north side of the Ohio River, was made to the Ohio Company 
of Associates, represented by Manasseh Cutler and Winthrop Sargent, 
agents.! 
It is a common misapprehenson that our educational land-grant pol- 
icy originated in the ordinance of 1787. On the contrary, the sources of 
that policy are found in the land ordinance of 1785 and the powers to 
the board of treasury of 1787. Still it is true, as Mr. Poole has said, 
that “the ordinance of 1787 and the Ohio purchase were parts of one 
and the same transaction. The purchase would not have been made 
without the ordinance, and the ordinance could not haye been enacted 
except as an essential condition of the purchase.”? 
The educational provisions of the land ordinance and of the powers 
to the board of treasury were purely specific in their application. The 
first related only to territory ceded by individual States and purchased 
by the United States of the Indians; the second, only to the sale of 
lands made to the Ohio Company. But the principles underlying those 
enactments have been progressively applied to all the public-land 
States; that is, to all the States west of the Allegheny Mountains, 
except West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Commonly 
the grants have been made in the enabling acts relating to the admis- 
sion of the several States into the Union. 
ENABLING ACT for Ohio, approved April 30, 1802. 
And be it further enacted, * * * That the section No. 16 in every township, and 
where such section has been sold, granted, or disposed of, other lands equivalent 
thereto and most contiguous to the same shall be granted to the inhabitants of such 
township for the use of schools * * * provided always, ete.3 * * * 
The reservation of school lands in the land ordinance, in the powers 
to the board of treasury, and in the enabling act for Ohio left 
unanswered the question of the mode of application. This question 
was, whether the public schools that the United States had endowed 
- should be under national or State control. In the case of the university 
there could be no such question, for the act of 1787 expressly said the 
university lands should be applied to the intended object by the legis- 
lature of the State. By an act approved March 3, 1803, Congress dis- 
posed of the open question by vesting in the legislature all lands 
granted to Ohio for the use of schools “in trust for the use aforesaid, 
and for no other use, intent, or purpose whatever.” +

Grant of lands made to Michigan for schools, act approved Sune 23, 1836. 
That section No. 16 in every township of the public lands within said State, and 
when such section has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent 
thereto, and as contiguous as may be, shall be granted to the State for the use of 
schools.! Z 
Previous to the admission of Michigan, one of two forms of grant had 
been followed. The Ohio form is that section No. 16 in every township 
“is granted to the inhabitants of such township, for the use of 
schools.” The Illinois form is that the grant “is made to the State for 
the use of the inhabitants of such township, for the use of schools.” 
The form of the grant for Michigan was an innovation that has been 
uniformly followed since that time. Under the Ohio and Illinois forms 
each Congressional township has its own separate fund; under the 
Michigan form there is one consolidated fund, the income of which is 
distributed according to scheol population. The latter practice is evi- 
dently more just, and also more conducive to safe and economical 
administration.? It is not surprising, therefore, that some of the older 
States have attempted to redistribute the township endowments.* 
AN ACT to establish the Territorial government of Oregon. Approved August 14, 1848. Section 20. 
That when the lands in the said Territory shall be surveyed under the direction 
of the Government of the United States, preparatory to bringing the same into mar- 
ket, sections numbered 16 and 36 in each township in said Territory shall be, and the 
same are hereby, reserved for the purpose of being applied to schools in said Territory, 
and in the States and Territories hereafter to be erected out of the same.* 
This was the first act appropriating section No. 36.as wellas No. 16 for 
the support of schools. California was the first State to receive the 
two sections to the township. 
Congress has neyer voted lands for common schools save to the 
public-land States. But in these States, or rather in two or three of 
them, section No. 16 in certain tracts could not be dedicated to schools 
because the tracts themselves had been disposed of as wholes. Thus 
the Western Reserve in Ohio was exploited by Connecticut, as else- 
where related, and the Virginia Military District, in the same State, by 
Virginia. Then there were many fractional townships where the eus- | 
tomary rule could not be applied. All such cases as these Congress in 
due time provided for by voting lands found in other localities. The 
following act, passed in 1826, provided in general for these cases:   
Cuar, LXXXII.—AN ACT to appropriate lands for the support of schools in certain townships and 
fractional townships, not before provided for. 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That to make provision for the support of schools, in all town- 
ships or’ fractional townships for which no land has been heretofore appropriated

2Judge Cooley gives the principal facts in regard to the form of the Michigan grant, in his “Mich- 
igan.” Commonwealth series, pp. 306-330. 
8The Indiana school law of 1852 is a notable example of such an attempt. (See Boone: History of 
Education in Indiana, Chaps. XI, XVI.) All such attempts, however, have failed, as the courts have 
held that the contemplated redistribution would be in violation of the trustship of the State.

for that use in those States in which section number sixteen, or other land equiva- 
lent thereto, is by law directed to be reserved for the support of schools in each 
township, there shall be reserved and appropriated, for the use of schools, in each 
entire township, or fractional township, for which no land has been heretofore 
appropriated or granted for that. purpose, the following quantities of land, to wit, 
for each township or fractional township containing a greater quantity of land than 
three-quarters of an entire township, one section; for a fractional township con- 
taining a greater quantity of land than one-half, and not more than three-quarters 
of a township, three-quarters of a section; for a fractional township containing a 
greater quantity of land than one-quarter, and not more than one-half of a town- 
ship, one-half section; and for a fractional township containing a greater quantity 
of land than one entire section, and not more than one-quarter of a township, one- 
quarter section of land. 
Src. 2, And be it further enacted, That the aforesaid tracts of land shall be selected 
- by the Secretary of the Treasury, out of any unappropriated public land within the 
land district where the township for which any tract is selected may bo situated; 
and when so selected, shall be held by the same tenure, and upon the same terms, 
for the support of schools in such township, as section number sixteen is, or may 
be held, in the State where such township shall be situated. 
Src. 3. And be it further enacted, That there shall be selected, in the manner above 
mentioned, one section and one-quarter section of land, for the support of schools 
within that tract of country usually called the French grant, in the county of Scioto, 
and State of Ohio.! 
Thus far land grants for higher institutions of learning have been 
mentioned only incidentally. The first that is heard of such grants 
by the National Government is in the powers to the board of treasury, 
1787, an extract from which has already been given. The rule has 
been to grant to each one of the public-land States 2 townships, 72 
sections, or 46,080 acres of land for this purpose. The legislation in 
the case of Michigan will answer the purpose of a general type.

ized to set apart and reserve from sale, out of any of the public lands within the 
Territory of Michigan, to which the Indian title may be extinguished, and not 
otherwise appropriated, a quantity of land, not exceeding two entire townships, 
for the use and support of a university within the Territory aforesaid, and for no 
other use or purpose whatsoever, to be located in tracts of land corresponding with 
any of the legal divisions into which the public lands are authorized to be surveyed, 
not less than one section; one of which said townships, so set apart and reserved 
from sale, shall be in lieu of an entire township of land, directed to be located in 
said Territory for the use of a seminary of learning therein, by an act of Congress 
entitled “An act making provision for the disposal of the public lands in the Indian 
Territory, and for other purposes,” approved March twenty-sixth, one thousand

educational lands are granted more definite and stringent. For exam- 
ple, the enabling act for the States of North Dakota, South Dakota,

Src, 11. That all lands herein granted for educational purposes shall be disposed 
of only at public sale, and at a price not less than ten dollars per acre, the proceeds 
to constitute a permanent school fund, the interest of which only shall be expended 
in the support of said schools. But said lands may, under such regulations as the 
legislatures shall prescribe, be leased for periods of not more than five years, in 
quantities not exceeding one section to any one person or company; and such land 
shall not be subject to pre-emption, homestead entry, or any other entry under the 
land laws of the United States, whether surveyed or unsurveyed, but shall be 
reserved for school purposes only. 
Src. 13. That five per centum of the proceeds of the sales of public lands lying 
within said States, which shall be sold by the United States subsequent to the 
admission of said States into the Union, after deducting all the expenses incident to 
the same, shall be paid to the said States, to be used as a permanent fund, the inter- 
est of which only shall be expended for the support of common schools within said 
States, respectively. 
Section 14 of the same act provides that the 72 sections of university 
lands granted*to each one of the four States shall not be sold for 
less than $10 per acre, but said lands may be leased as provided for in

ceeds arising from the sale or disposal of any lands herein granted for educational 
purposes shall be used for the support of any sectarian or denominational school, 
college, or university.

States under the act of September 28, 1850, and in lieu of any grant 
of swamp lands to said States, gives them specific quantities of land

acres; for agricultural colleges, in addition to the grant hereinbefore made for that 
purpose, fifty thousand acres; for the establishment of a State reform school, fifty 
thousand acres; for the establishment of a deaf and dumb asylum, fifty thousand 
acres; for public buildings at the capital of the State, in addition to the grant here- 
inbefore made for that purpose, one hundred and fifty thousand acres, 
To the State of Washington: For the establishment and maintenance of a scien- 
tifie school, one hundred thousand acres; for State normal schools, one hundred 
thousand acres; for public buildings at the State capital, in addition to the grant 
hereinbefore made for that purpose, one hundred thousand acres; for State chari- 
table, educational, penal, and reformatory institutions, two hundred thousand acres, 
That the States provided for in this act shall not be entitled to any further or 
other grants of land for any purpose than as expressly provided in this act. And 
the lands granted by this section shall be held, appropriated, and disposed of exclu- 
sively for the purposes herein mentioned, in sueh manner as the legislatures of the 
respective States may severally provide. ! 
One vigorous attempt was made to arrest the national educational 
policy, or at least to change its character. The legislature of Mary- 
land in 1821 adopted-an elaborate report, submitted by the committee to 
which so much of the governor’s annual message as related to education 
and public instruction had been referred, that concluded with the follow- 
ing resolutions: 
Resolved, by the general assembly of Maryland, That each of the United States has 
an equal right to participate in the benefit of the public lands, the common property 
of the Union. 
Resolved, That the States in whose favor Congress have not made appropriations 
of land for the purposes of education, are entitled to such appropriations as will 
correspond, in a just proportion, with those heretofore made in favor of the other 
States. 
Resolved, That his excellency the governor be required to transmit copies of the 
foregoing report and resolutions to each of our Senators and Representatives in 
Congress, with a request that they will lay the same before their respective Houses, 
and use their endeavors to procure the passage of an act to carry into effect the just 
principle therein set forth. 
Resolved, That his excellency the governor be also requested to transmit copies of 
the said report and resolutions to the governors of the several States of the Union, 
with a request that they will communicate the same to the legislatures thereof, 
respectively, and solicit their cooperation. 
The legislatures of New Hampshire and Vermont indorsed this 
report. The legislature of Ohio, on the other hand, adopted a long 
and carefully drawn reply submitted on December 26, 1819, by a special 
committee of five, to which the Maryland, New Hampshire, and Vermont 
reports had been referred. And this appears to have been the end of 
the matter.’

same; resolution of 1867; act to establish agricultural experiment stations; act of 
1890; appendix to VI and VIL. ‘ 
Before the middle of this century the subject of education in methods 
of agriculture and kindred subjects began to attract attention in some 
of the Western States. In 1850 the legislature of Michigan petitioned 
Congress for 350,000 acres of land_for the establishment and mainte- 
nance of agricultural schools within her limits, and in 1855 that State 
established an agricultural school. From 1850 the general subject was 
held before Congress by memorials, resolutions, and petitions emanating 
from agricultural societies, farmers’ conventions, and State legislatures. 
In 1859 Congress passed a bill granting to each State, for the mainte- 
nance of agricultural schools, 26,000 acres of the public land within its 
borders for each Senator and Representative in Congress to which the 
State was entitled. Land scrip to an equal amount was given when 
there was no public land within the State. This land the State was 
empowered to sell, but not to locate. The contest over this bill in the 
two Houses was a severe one, most of the opposition coming from the 
Southern members. President Buchanan vetoed the bill on the ground 
that it was unconstitutional, and that it intermingled national and 
State affairs in a mischievous manner. A bill drawn on the same lines, 
but granting 30,000 acres of land for each Senator and Representative, 
passed the Thirty-seventh Congress, and received the approval of 
President Lincoln, July 2, 1862.

which shall be inviolably appropriated by each State which may take and claim the 
benefit of this act to the endowment, support, and maintenance of at least one 
college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and 
classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning 
as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, in such manner as the legisla-

made to the Secretary of Agriculture, as well as to the Secretary of the Interior, 
regarding the condition and progress of each college, Including statistical informa- 
tion in relation to its receipts and expenditures, its library, the number of its stu- 
dents and professors, and also as to any improvements and experiments made under 
the direction of any experiment’stations attached to said colleges, with their cost 
and results, and such other industrial and economical statistics as may be regarded 
as useful, one copy of which shall be transmitted by mail free to all other colleges 
further endowed under this act. 
Sec. 4. That on or before the first day of July in each year, after the passage of 
this act, the Secretary of the Interior shall ascertain and certify to the Secretary of 
the Treasury as to.cach State and Territory whether it is entitled to receive its share 
of the annual appropriation for colleges, or of institutions for colored students, under 
this act, and the amount which thereupon each is entitled respectively to receive. 
If the Secretary of the Interior shall withhold a certificate from any State or Ter- 
. vitory of its appropriation the facts and reasons thercfor shall be reported to the 
President, and the amount involved shall be kept separate in the Treasury until the 
close of the next Congress, in order that the State or Territory may, if it should so 
desire, appeal to Congress from the determination of the Secretary of the Interior. 
If the next Congress shall not direct such sum to be paid it shall be covered into the 
Treasury. And the Secretary of the Interior is hereby charged with the proper 
administration of this law. 
Sec. 5. That the Seeretary of the Interior shall annually report to the Congress 
the disbursements which have been made in all the States and Territories, and also. 
whether the appropriation of any State or Territory has been withheld, and if so, the 
* reason therefor. 
Src. 6. Congress may at any time amend, suspend, or repeal any or all of the pro- 
visions of this act.!

Wyoming, and Idaho upon the usual scale—90,000 acres to each State 
save to South Dakota, to which 120,000 acres has been given. 
They have also received, in lieu of the saline lands, swamp lands, 
and 500,000-acre grants for internal improvements, specific grants for 
normal schools, scientific schools, or schools for mines, and also for 
public buildings. 
The method of the Governinent has been as soon as, in running the 
lines of public surveys, the school sections in place 16 and 36 are fixed. 
and determined, the apprepriation thereof for the educational object 
is, under the law, complete, and lists are made out and patents thereof 
issued to the States. 
When sections 16 and 36 are found to be covered with prior adverse 
rights, such as legal occupancy, and settlement by individuals under 
settlement laws prior to survey of the lands, or deficient in area because 
of the fractional character of the townships, or from other causes, 
selections for indemnity are made. 
The acts of Congress quoted in Chapters VI and VII, and the tables 
here given, do not make a complete showing of what the National Gov- 
ernment has done for education. Previous to June 30, 1882, there was 
patented -to certain States under various acts of Congress 559,965 
acres of saline lands.'- Previous to June 30, 1883, there was patented 
to the public-land States, in pursuance of law, 56,455,467 acres of 
swamp and overflowed lands.2 In 1841 Congress passed what is 
known as the “State selection act,” by which it granted to each State 
named, and to each new State that should thereafter be admitted into 
the Union, 500,000 acres of public lands for internal improvements, 
which included the quantity that was granted to such State before its 
admission and while under a Territorial government for such purpose. 
Previous to June 30, 1883, the selections made under this act amounted 
to 7,806,554 acres.’ By a long series of acts Congress also granted to 
the public-land States, except California, 2, 3, and 5 per cent on the 
net proceeds of the sales of public lands made therein. These allow- 
ances were originally made on the condition that the States should 
not tax lands sold ky the Government for a term of years after they 
were sold. This was with a view of increasing the sales of wild lands. 
Previous to June 30, 1882, payments to the States on this account 
amounted to $7,333,069. There have also been many special grants 
for educational purposes that need not be here enumerated.® 
Still another source of contribution must be mentioned. By the 
year 1836 a considerable surplus over and above the wants of the 
Government had. accumulated in the National Treasury, the disposal of 
which became a political question. Congress finally disposed of both 
question and surplus. by sections 13 and 14 of an act to regulate the

deposits of public money, approved June 23, 1836. It was enacted 
that the money which remained in the Treasury on January 1, 1837, 
reserving the sum of $5,000,000, should be deposited with such of the 
several States, in proportion to their respective representation in the 
Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, as should 
by law authorize their treasurers, or other competent authorities, to 
“receive the same on the terms specified; and the Secretary of the 
Treasury should deliver the same.to such treasurers or other compe- 
tent authorities, on receiving certificates of deposit therefor, duly 
signed, which should express the usual and legal obligations, and 
pledge the faith of the State for the safe-keeping and repayment of 
the money, and should pledge the faith of the States receiving the 
same to pay them and every part thereof, from time to time, whenever 
they should be required by the Secretary of the Treasury for the 
purpose of defraying any wants of the public Treasury, beyond the 
amount of $5,000,000 aforesaid. If any State should decline to receive 
its proportion of the surplus on the terms named, the same should be 
deposited with the other States agreeing to accept the same, in the 
same proportion. It was further enacted that the said deposits should 
be made with the States in the proportions named: one-quarter Janu- 
ary 1, 1837; one-quarter April 1; one-quarter July 1, and one-quarter 
October 1, all in the same year.'' The surplus amounted on January 1, 
1837, to $37,468,859.97, three-fourths of which sum was divided among 
the States according to the method prescribed in the act; the fourth 
installment was never paid, owing to the necessities of the Govern- 
ment growing out of the financial crisis of that year. The States 
receiving the deposits have never repaid them, and have never been 
called upon to do so. : 
The lands and moneys described in the preceding paragraphs were 
granted to the States to be used for such purposes as they saw fit. 
Naturally, an example was soon set of bestowing the funds arising from 
these sources, in whole or in part, on education, and with the lapse of time 
this example has been more and more followed. Many of the States 
applied the money received in 1837, in whole or in part, temporarily or 
permanently, to schools and education. In this list are found Ala- 
bama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hlinois, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylva- 
nia, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont. The schools of some of 
these States still derive a revenue from this source. It is foreign to 
the present purpose to inquire into the disposition that the States have 
made of the other funds mentioned. It will be found, however, that 
these subjects are frequently referred to in the extracts made from 
State constitutions in Section X of this paper °

the same time Dr. Henry Barnard, who was prevented from attending 
the Harrisburg meeting by illness, matured a plan of a central agency 
and headquarters for conference, correspondence, discussion, and pub- 
lication relating to schools and education. At this meeting the asso- 
ciation adopted resolutions that commended to the General Government 
the organization of a bureau of education for the purpose of collecting 
and publishing educational statistics and of making suggestions for the 
advancement of popular education in the several States, and that 
authorized that a committee of five be appointed to carry the resolu- 
tions into effect, and that the president of the-association be chairman 
of said committee. It was further resolved that a committee of three 
from each State represented in the association be appointed, whose duty 
it should be to circulate petitions among the people of their respective 
States praying Congress to establish a department of education.t| What

and J. S. Adams, secretary of the State board of education, Vermont.' 
The committee prepared the memorial before separating, and requested 
General Garfield, who was then serving his second term in Congress, to 
take charge of the measure in the House of Representatives. General 
Garfield consented to accept the commission, but requested Dr. White to 
draw up the bill, which he did? On February 14, having first obtained 
leave, General Garfield introduced the bill and memorial. The bill was 
twice read, the two documents were ordered printed, and the subject 
was referred to a select committee of seven: Garfield of Ohio, chairman; 
Boutwell of Massachusetts, Molton of Ilinois, Patterson of New Jer- 
sey, Donnelly of Minnesota, Goodyear of New York, and Randall of 
Pennsylvania. On April 3 the committee reported a so-called substi- 
tute, but the substitute was the original bill slightly amended, the 
principal change being the adoption of the name department instead of 
bureau. The subject was debated at considerable length. In its favor 
it was argued that the department, if established, would be of great 
service in collecting and publishing statistics and other information 
concerning education, and that it would be serviceable in promoting 
schools and education in the Southern States. It was replied that it 
was unnecessary and unconstitutional, and would prove expensive. The 
vote was taken June 8. Mr. Garfield had granted to other members of 
the house so much of the time allotted to the discussion that his own 
speech was cut short by the Speaker’s hammer; however, in response 
to earnest requests, he wrote out his notes in full and gave the speech 
to the public.’ The vote stood 59 yeas to 61 nays, but was reconsidered 
Junel9, Mr. Garfield said it was an interest that had no lobby to press 
itsclaims. ‘It is the voice of the children of the land,” he said, “ask- - 
ing us to give them all the blessings of our civilization.” The bill now 
passed, 80 yeas to 44 nays. Carried to the Senate, it was immediately 
referred to the Judiciary Committee. At the next session, January 30, 
1867, it was reported back; February 27 it passed after brief discus- 
sion, and March 2 it received the President’s approval. ‘The change 
wrought in the temper of the House between the 8th and 19th of June 
was mainly due to the persistent zeal with which General Garfield 
urged the measure in private. In later debates—for the department 
was no sooner created than attacks upon it began—one member said the 
passage of the bill by the House was due to Garfield’s “persuasive 
eloquence,” and another declared that it was carried by “dint of per- 
sonal entreaty.” In defending the department, Garfield called the 
proposition to abolish it “ putting out the eyes of the Government.”

I. MEMORIAL OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE AND CITY 
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRE- 
SENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES, FEBRUARY 10, 1866. 
At ameeting of the National Association of State and City School Superintendents, 
recently held in the city of Washington, D. C., the undersigned were appointed a 
committee to memorialize Congress for the establishment of a national bureau of 
education. 
It was the unanimous opinion of the association that the interests of education 
would be greatly promoted by the organization of such a bureau at the present 
time; that it would render needed assistance in the establishment of school systems 
where they do not now exist, and that it would also prove a potent means for improy- 
ing and vitalizing existing systems. This it could accomplish— 
(1) By securing greater uniformity and accuracy in school statistics, and so inter- 
preting them that they may be more widely available and reliable as educational 
tests and measures, 
(2) By bringing together the results of school systems in different communities, 
States, and countries, and determining their comparative value. 
(3) By collecting the results of all important experiments in new and special 
methods of school instruction and management, and making them the common property 
of school officers and teachers throughout the country. 
(4) By diffusing among the people information respecting the school laws of the 
different States; the various modes of providing and disbursing school funds; the 
different classes of school officers and their relative duties; the qualifications required 
of teachers, the modes of their examination, and the agencies provided for their 
special training; the best methods of classifying and grading schools; improved 
plans of schoolhouses, together with modes of heating and ventilation, etc., infor- 
mation now obtained only by a few persons and at great expense, but which is of 
the highest value to all intrusted with the management of schools. 
(5) By aiding communities and States in the organization of school systems in 
which mischievous errors shall be avoided and vital agencies and well-tried improve- 
ments be included. 
(6) By the general diffusion of correct ideas respecting the value of education as a 
quickener of intellectual activities; as amoral renovator; asa multiplier of industry 
and a consequent producer of wealth; and, finally, as the strength and shield of 
civil liberty. 
In the opinion of your memorialists, it is not possible to measure the influence 
which the faithful performance of these duties by a national bureau would exert 
upon the cause of education throughout the country; and few persons who have not 
been intrusted with the management of school systems can fully realize how wide- 
spread and urgent is the demand for such assistance. Indeed, the very existence of 
the association which your memorialists represent is itself positive proof of a demand 
for a national channel of communication between the school officers of different 
States. Millions of dollars have been thrown away in fruitless experiments, or in 
stolid plodding, for the want of it. 
Your memorialists would also submit that the assistance and encouragement of the 
General Government are needed to secure the adoption of schcol systems throughout 
the country. An ignorant people have no inward impulse to lead them to self- 
education. Just where education is most needed, there it is always least appreciated 
and valued. It is, indeed, a law of educational progress that its impulse and stim- 
ulus come from without. ‘ Hence it is that Adam Smith and other writers on political 
economy expressly except education from the operation of the general law of supply 
and demand. They teach, correctly, that the demand for education must be awak- 
ened by external influences and agencies. 
This law is illustrated by the fact that entire school systems, both in this and in 
other countries, have been lifted up, as it were bodily, by just such influences as a 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1291 
national bureau of education would exert upon the schools of the several States; 
and this, too, without its being invested with any official control of the school 
authorities therein. Indeed, the highest value of such a bureau would be its quick- 
ening and informing influence, rather than its authoritative and directive control. 
The true function of such a bureau is not to direct officially in the school affairs in 
the States, but rather to cooperate with and assist them in the great work of estab- 
lishing and maintaining systems of public instruction. All experience teaches that 
the nearer the responsibility of supporting and directing schools is brought to those 
immediately benefited by them, the greater their vital power and efficiency. 
Your memorialists beg permission to suggest one other special duty which should 
be intrusted to the national bureau, and which of itself will justify its ereation, 
viz, an investigation of the management and results of the frequent munificent 
grants of land made by Congress for the promotion of general and special education. 
It is estimated that these grants, if they had been properly managed, would now 
present an aggregate educational fund of about $500,000,000. If your memorialists 
are not misinformed, Congress has no official information whatever respecting the 
manner in which these trusts have been managed. 
In conclusion, your memorialists beg leave to express their earnest belief that uni- 
versal education, next to universal liberty, is a matter of deep national concern. 
Our experiment of republican institutions is not upon the scale of a petty munici- 
pality or State, but it covers half a continent, and embraces people of widely 
diverse interests and conditions, but who are to continue “one and inseparable.” 
Every condition of our perpetuity and progress as a nation adds emphasis to the 
remark of Montesquieu, that ‘‘itis in a republican government that the whole power 
of education is required.” 
It is an imperative necessity of the American Republic that the common school be 
planged on every square mile of its peopled territory, and that the instruction therein 
imparted be carried to the highest point of efficiency. The creation of a bureau of 
education by Congress would be a practical recognition of this great truth. It 
would impart to the cause of education a dignity and importance which would 
surely widen its influence and enhance its success. 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

IX. BARLY VIEWS AND PLANS RELATING TO A NATIONAL 
UNIVERSITY. 
I. The Federal Convention.—1I. President Washington.—I1I. Letters of Dr. Rush.—IV. 
The first President Adams.—V. President Jefferson.—VI. Joel Barlow’s plans.— 
VII. President Madison.—VIII. President Monroe.—IX. The second President 
Adams. 
I, THE FEDERAL CONVENTION, 1787, 
Several attempts were made in the Federal Convention of 1787 to 
give Congress educational powers. The “Plan of a Federal constitu- 
tion” submitted by Mr. Charles Pinckney, of South Carolina, May 29,! 
included the following among other legislative powers: ‘To establish 
and provide for a national university at the seat of government of the 
United States.” August 18 these propositions were referred to the 
committee of detail, on motion of Mr. Pinckney: “To establish semi- 
naries of learning for the promotion of literature and the arts and sci- 
ences;” ‘“ To establish public institutions, rewards, and immunities for 
the promotion of agriculture, commerce, trades, and manufactures.” 
Neither one of these propositions, nor any reference to them, is con- 
tained in any report made by the committee to the Convention that is 
found in the Journal. Under date of September 14 we find the follow- 
ing in Mr. Madison’s report of the debates: 
Mr. Madison and Mr. Pinckney then moved to insert in the list of powers vested 
in Congress a power ‘‘to establish a university in which no preferences or distinc- 
tions should be allowed on account of religion.” 
Mr. Wilson supported the motion. 
Mr. GOUVERNEUR Morris. It is not necessary. The exclusive power at the seat 
of government will reach the object. 
On the question: 
Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, aye—4; New Hampshire, 
Massachusetts, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Georgia, no—6. Connecticut, 
divided; Dr. Johnson, aye; Mr. Sherman, no.? - 
Morris’s argument is the only one reported on either side, but it 
would be strange indeed, considering the state of opinion in the Con- 
vention concerning the relative spheres of the Federal and State gov- 
ernments, if the stronger objection, although it may not have been 
expressed, was not that the proposition was an invasion of the proper 
jurisdiction of the State authority? But however this may be, the 
1It is well known to students of the history of the Federal Convention that the so-called “ Pinckne, 
plan” is a document of little authority. Seo The Madison Papers,” III, Appendix 2, ana “The Writ- ings of James Madison,” IV, 172, 173, 181, 182, 338, 339, 378, 379. Still, it is proper to cite the passage 
in relation to the university, since Mr. Pinckney alone certainly brought the subject forward, August 18, and again in connection with Mr, Madison, September 14. Dr. Goode does not mention Pinckney, 
but gives the whole credit to Madison. 
2Elliot’s Debates, Vols. I, p, 147; V, 440, 544. 
®Dr. Henry Barnard, commenting on this history, says Pinckney’s motion was lost, as reported by Madison, expressly on the ground that the power to establish such a university was included in 
the grant of exclusive legislation over the district in which the Government should be located (Report of 
the Commissioner of Education, 1868, p. 41). Dr. Barnard’s statement is stronger than the record will 
justify. ‘The fact that Mr. Madison reports only this argument is no proof that such was the accepted 
view of the subject. Action in the Federal Convention was often influenced by arguments that were 
not stated atall. Nor is Mr. Madison’s report of the discussions by any means a full one.  
-P-A-G-E-76
  1294 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
practical result of the Convention’s action on the whole subject, or 
rather inaction, was that education was left where it always had been, 
in the hands of the States or of the people. Still, two of its foremost 
members, and one of them its president, in after years strove to per- 
suade Congress to establish a national university. The history of their 
efforts in that direction not only shows what were their views of the 
constitutional question, but is also extremely interesting in itself. It 
is, moreover, not improbable that Washington was associated with 
Pinekney and Madison in their efforts in the Convention. 
The attempt to give education a status in the National Constitution 
was renewed in 1875-76, but in quite a new form. In his annual mes- 
sage, read December 7, 1875, President Grant urged upon Congress cer- 
tain matters of legislation that he deemed of “vital importance,” of 
which these are two: 
First. That the States shall be required to afford the opportunity of a good common 
school education to every child within their limits. 
Second. No sectarian tenets shall ever be taught in any school supported in whole 
or in part by the State, nation, or by the proceeds of any tax levied upon any com- 
munity. Make education compulsory so far as to deprive all- persons who can not 
read and write from becoming voters after the year 1890, disfranchising none, how- 
ever, on grounds of illiteracy, who may be voters at ithe time this amendment takes 
effect. 7 
On the 14th of the same month Hon. J. G. Blaine, in the House of 
Representatives, introduced a resolution proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution, which, as slightly modified by the Judiciary Committee, 
passed August 4, 1876, by a vote of 180 yeas to 7 nays, as follows: 
Article xvr. No State shall make any law respecting ar establishment of religion 
‘or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any 
State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, 
nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any reli- 
gious sect or denomination; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be 
divided between religious sects or denominations. ‘This article shall not vest, 
enlarge, or diminish legislative power in Congress.! 
  Three days later the Senate adopted a substitute for this resolution 
that had been recommended by the Judiciary Committee. The vote 
stood 28 yeas, 16 nays. As two-thirds did not vote in the affirmative, 
. the resolution was Jost. The substitute adopted by the Senate read as 
follows: 
ARTICLE XVI. No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no religious test shall ever be required 
as a qualification to any office or public trust under any State. No public property 
and no publie revenue of, nor any loan of credit by or under the authority of the 
United States, or any State, Territory, District, or municipal corporation shall be 
appropriated to or made or used for the support of any school, educational or other 
institution under the control of any religious or antireligious sect, organization, or 
denomination, or wherein the particular creed or tenets of any religious or antire- 
ligious sect, organization, or denomination shall be tanght. And no such particular

ereed or tenets shall be read or taught in any school or institution supported in 
whole or in part by such revenue or loan of credit, and no such appropriation or 
loan of credit shall be mado to any religious or antireligious sect, organization, or 
denomination, or to promote its interests or tenets. This articie shall not be con- 
strued to prohibit the reading of the Bible in any school or institution; and it shall 
not have the effect to impair rights of property already vested. 
Sxc. 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to provide for the 
prevention and punishment of violations of this article.! 
II. PRESIDENT WASHINGTON, 
The first voice pleading for a national university is heard amid the 
tumult of the patriot soldiery that flocked to the beleaguer of Boston 
after Lexington and Concord. Samuel Blodget tells the story in a 
passage of his Economica,’ the great interest of which does not permit 
either mutilation or abridgment: 
As the most minute circumstances are sometimes instructing for their relation to 
great events, we relate the first we ever heard of a national university: It was in 
the camp at Cambridge, in October, 1775, when Maj. William Blodget went to the 
quarters of General Washington to complain of thé ruinous state of the colleges 
from the conduct of the militia quartered therein. The writer of this being in 
company with his friend and relation, and hearing General Greene join in lament- 
ing the then ruinous state of the eldest seminary of Massachusetts, observed, 
merely to console the company of friends, that to make amends for these injuries, 
after our war, he hoped we should erect a noble national university, at which the 
youth of all the world might be proud to receive instructions. What was thus 
pleasantly said, Washington immediately replied to, with that inimitably expressive 
and truly interesting look for which he was sometimes so remarkable: “Young 
man, you area prophet, inspired to speak what I am confident will one day be real- 
ized.” He then detailed to the company his impressions, that all North America 
would one day become united; he said that a Colonel Byrd, of Virginia, was the 
first man who had pointed out the best central seat for the capital city, near to the 
present spot, or about the falls of the Potomac. General Washington further said 
that a Mr. Evans had expressed the same opinion with many other gentlemen, who, 
from a cursory view of a chart of North America, received this natural and truly 
correct impression. The look of General Washington, the energy of his mind, his 
noble and irresistible eloquence, all conspired so far to impress the writer with 
these subjects, that if ever he should unfortunately become insane it will be from 
his anxiety for. the Federal city and national university. 
It is well known that Washington’s interest in the site on which the 
city which bears his name stands dates from the time when he was 
encamped there with the Virginia troops in 1755. The above extract

*Blodget’s Economica, the alternative title of which is A Statesman's Manual for the United States of America, said to be the first work on political economy published in America, was pub- lished in Washington in 1806. The author copyrighted it “for the benefit, in trust, for the free education fund of the university founded by George Washington in his last years.” ‘Two mottoes 
appear on the title-page: ‘The legislature ought to make the people happy” (Aristotle on Govern- ment), and “Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas.” Iam indebted to Dr. G. Brown Goode, of the National Museum, for the quotations made above, and also for my information of Blodget. See Dr. Goode’s instructive monograph, The Origin of the National Scientific and Educational Institu- tions of the United States, published by the American Historical Association, report for 1889. See also memorial in regard to a national university, by John W. Hoyt, Washington, Government Print- ing Office, 1892, and the Special Report of the Commissioner of Education on the Condition and Improvement of Public Schools in the District of Columbia, Washington, 1871, pp. 145 et seq.

shows very plainly that in his mind a firm union of the States, a 
national capital, and a national university were intimately associated. 
These were favorite ideas with which he never parted. It is also inter- 
esting to note that this first suggestion of a national university is 
immediately prompted by the desecration and havoc that war was 
making in the college buildings at Cambridge. The idea next comes 
to the surface in a place far better adapted to its consideration than 
Washington’s camp, viz, in the Federal Convention at Philadelphia, - 
as shown above. 
In his “Speech delivered to both Houses of Congress,” January 8, 
1790—which we should now call his first annual message—President 
Washington recommended certain interesting objects to their attention. 
After mentioning “uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures,” 
“the advancement of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,” and 
the “expediency of giving effectual encouragement, as well to the intro- 
duction of new and useful inventions from abroad as to the exertions 
of skill and genius in producing them at home,” and of “facilitating 
the intercourse between the distant parts of our country by a due atten- 
tion to the post-office and post-roads”—all subjects in which he took a 
deep interest—he thus treats another subject that lay still nearer his 
heart: 
Nor am I less persuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there is 
nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science and 
literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness. In 
one, in which the measures of government receive their impression so immediately 
from the sense of the community, as in ours, it is proportionably essential. To the 
security of a free constitution it contributes in various ways; by convincing those who 
are intrusted with the public administration that every valuable end of government 
is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people, and by teaching the 
people themselves to know and to value their own rights; to discern and provide 
against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression and the necessary 
exercise of lawful authority, between burthens proceeding from a disregard to their 
convenience and those resulting from the inevitable exigencies of society; to dis- 
eriminate the spirit of liberty from that of licentiousness, cherishing the first and 
avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy but temperate vigilance against encroach- 
ments, with an inviolable respect to the laws. 
Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids to semi- 
naries of learning already established, by the institution of a national university, or 
by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the deliberations of*the 
legislature.! 
Washington was not a strict-construction statesman. His subse- 
quent action shows that his mind never encountered any constitutional 
difficulties on the university question. He no doubt fully concurred 
in the view held by Mr. Morris; moreover, his practical mind found 
abundant authority for his favorite educational ideas in the general- 
welfare clause. 
Beyond a general expression of concurrence in his views respecting 
the promotion of education and literature made by the House of Rep.

  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1297 
resentatives in reply to the President’s speech, it does not appear that 
Congress paid the slightest attention to the subject.' Nor do we again 
hear of it for several years. This fact, apparently surprising in view 
of Washington’s unflagging interest, is explained by a transaction of 
great national importance. 
The permanent seat of the National Government was established on 
the Potomac by an act of Congress approved June 28, 1790, and the 
names Columbia. and Washington were given, by the commissioners 
created by the act, to the Federal district and the Federal city, Sep- 
tember 7,1791. The establishment of the capital strengthened Wash- 
ington’s conviction as to the proper seat of a national university. 
But the Federal district was a forest; ten years was the time allotted 
to prepare the Federal city for the reception of the Government; and 
those who have read the contemporary accounts of the condition of 
Washington in the year 1800 will not be surprised that even Washing- 
ton’s ardor was for the time restrained. Blodgét reports a conyersa- 
tion with the President, in which he “stated his opinion that till there 
were 4,000 or 5,000 inhabitants in the city of Washington, and until 
Congress were comfortably accommodated, it might be premature to 
commence a seminary. * * * He did not wish to see the work 
commence until the city was prepared for it.” 
A longer, though less important, series of transactions must now be 
related. Washington was always deeply interested in economical and 
industrial subjects. His views in regard to public improvements, and 
particularly in regard to uniting the seaboard with what were then 
called “the western waters,” by means of transportation lines, are well 
known. In1785 the legislature of Virginia voted him, as a testimonial 
for his public services, 50 shares of the stock in the Potomac Company 
and 100 shares in the James River Company, in both of which enter- 
prises he had taken great interest. In obedience to the resolution that 
he had made in 1775 not to accept compensation or reward for publie 
service, he declined to accept the gift; or, rather, he retained it with a 
view of devoting it to some object of a public nature which should meet 
the enlightened and patriotic views of the body that had voted the 
bounty. How much embarrassed he was by the gift is shown by his 
numerous letters in relation to the subject.2, Nor was he able readily 
to make up his mind in regard to its destination. He wrote Mr. Jeffer- 
son as follows, September 26, 1785: 
I never for a moment entertained an idea of accepting it. The difficulty with 
which my mind labored was how to refuse without giving offense. Ultimately I 
have it in contemplation to apply the profits arising from the tolls to some public 
use. In this, if I knew how, I would meet the wishes of the assembly; but, if I am 
not able to come at these, my own inclination leads me to apply them to the estab- 
lishment of two charity schools, one on each river, for the education and support of 
1It will be remembered that in the early history of the Government the two houses were accustomed 
to make formal replies to the President's annual address.

poor children, especially the descendants of those who have fallen in defense of 
their country.! 
How early Washington settled this question in his own mind we can 
not tell. He wrote to Edmund Randolph, December 15, 1794, inclosing 
an extract from his will, which Dr. Sparks? supposes to have been the 
same in substance as the provisions relating to the same subject found 
in the will that Washington executed July 9, 1799, quoted hereafter. 
He asks Randolph in conjunction with Mr. Madison to mature a plan 
for disposing of the stock. But whether Dr. Sparks’s inference on this 
point is correct or not, it is certain that, about this time, the shares in 
the improvement companies, or rather the shares in one of them, in 
Washington’s mind, became a part of the endowment of a national 
university. January 28, 1795, he addressed this letter to the commis- 
sioners of the Federal district. 
Aplan for the establishment of a university in the Federal city has frequently 
been the subject of conversation; but in what manner it is proposed to commence 
this important institution, on how extensive a scale, the means by which it is to be 
effected, how it is to be supported, or what progress is made in it, are matters alto- 
gether unknown tome. It hasalways been a source of serious reflection and sincere 
regret with me that the youth of the United States should be sent to foreign coun- 
tries for the purpose of education. Although thero are doubtless many, under these 
circumstances, who escape the danger of contracting principles unfavorable to 
republican government, yet we ought to deprecate the hazard. attending ardent and 
susceptible minds, from being teo strongly and too early prepossessed in favor of 
other political systems before they are capable of appreciating their own. 
For this reason I have greatly wished to see a plan adopted by which the arts, 
sciences, and belles-lettres could be taught in their fullest cxtent, thereby embracing 
all the advantages of European tuition, with the means of acquiring the liberal 
knowledge which is necessary to qualify our citizens for tho exigencies of public as 
well as private life; and (which with me is a consideration of great magnitude) by 
assembling the youth from the different parts of this rising Republic, contributing 
from their intercourse and interchange of information to the removal of prejudices 
which might perhaps sometimes arise from local circumstances. 
The Federal city, from its centrality and the advantages which in other respects 
it must have over any other place in the United States, ought to be preferred asa 
proper site forsuch auniversity. Andif aplan can be.adopted upon a scalcas exten- 
sive as I have described, and the execution of it should commence under favorable 
auspices in a reasonable time, with a fair prospect of success, I will grant in perpe- 
tuity 50 shares in the navigation of the Potomac River towards the endowment of it. 
What annuity will arise from these 50 shares when the navigation is in full opera- 
tion can at this time be only conjectured; and those who are acquainted with it 
can form as good a judgment as myself. 
As the design of this university has assumed no form with which I am acquainted, 
and as I am equally ignorant who the persons are who have taken or are disposed to 
take the maturing of the plan upon themselves, I have been at a loss to whom I 
should make this communication of my intentions. If the commissioners of the 
Federal city haveeany particular agency in bringing the matter forward, then the 
information which I now give to them is in its proper course. If, on the other 
hand, they have no more to do in it than others who may be desirous of seeing so 
important a measure carried into-effect, they will be se good as toexcuse my using 
them as the medium for disclosing these my intentions; because it appears necessary 
  
1 Sparks, IX, 133, 2 Sparks, XI, 3.  
-P-A-G-E-81
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1299 
that the funds for the establishment and support of the institution should be known 
to the promoters of it, and I see no mode more eligible for announcing my purpose. 
For these reasons I give you the trouble of this address and the assurance of being,! 
ete. 
The next step soon followed. March 16 Washington wrote to Goy- 
ernor Brooke, of Virginia, in regard to the disposition to be made of 
the shares: 
It is with indescribable regret that I have seen the youth of the United States 
migrating to foreign countries in order to acquire the higher branches of erudition 
and to obtain a knowledge of the sciences. Although it would be injustice tomany 
to pronounce the certainty of their imbibing maxims not congenial with republican- 
ism, it must, nevertheless, be admitted that a serious danger is encountered by send- 
ing abroad among other political systems those who have not well learned the value 
of their own. 
The time is therefore come when a plan of universal education ought to be adopted 
in the United States. Not only do the exigencies of public and private life demand 
it, but if it should ever be apprehended that prejudice would be entertained in one 
part of the Union against another, an efficacious remedy will be to assemble the 
youth of every part under such circumstances as will, by freedom of intercourse and 
collision of sentiment, give to their minds the direction of truth, philanthropy, and 
mutual conciliation. 
It has been represented that a university corresponding with these ideas is con- 
templated to be built in the Federal city, and that it will receive considerable 
endowments. This position isso eligible from its centrality, so convenient to Virginia, 
by whose legislature the shares were granted, and in which part of the Federal dis- 
trict stands, and combines so many other conveniences that I have determined to 
vest the Potomac shares in that university. 
Presuming it to be more agreeable to the general assembly of Virginia that the 
shares in the James River Company should be reserved for a similar object in some 
part of that State, I intend to allot them for’a seminary to be erected at such place 
as they shall deem most proper. I am disposed to believe that a seminary of learn- 
ing upon an enlarged plan, but yet not coming up to the full idea of a university, is 
an institution to be preferred for the position which is to be chosen. The students 
who wish to pursue the whole range of science may pass with advantage from the 
seminary to the university, and the former by a due relation may be rendered 
cooperative with the latter. 
Ican not, however, dissemble my opinion that if all the shares were conferred on 
a university it would become far more important than when they are divided; and 
I have been constrained from concentering them in the same place mercly by my 
anxiety to reconcile a particular attention to Virginia with a great good, in which 
she will abundantly share in common with the rest of the United States. 
I must beg the favor of your excellency to lay this letter before that honorable 
body at their next session, in order that I may appropriate the James River shares 
to the place which they may prefer.? 
The Virginia legislature, responding to the President’s views, Decem- 
ber 1, 1795, declared it highly disadvantageous for American youth to 
go to foreign countries to complete their education. It not only ratified 
the use to which he proposed to devote the stock, but also resolved 
that “the plan contemplated of erecting a university in the Federal 
city, where the youth of the several States may be assembled and their

course of education finished, deserves the countenance and support of 
each State.” These are the two principal resolutions in full: 
Resolved, therefore, That the appropriation by the said George Washington of the 
aforesaid shares in the Potomac Company to the university intended to be erected 
in the Federal city is made in a manner most worthy of public regard and of the 
approbation of this Commonwealth. 
Resolved, also That he be requested to appropriate the aforesaid shares in the 
James River Company to a seminary at such place in the upper country as he may 
deem most convenient to a majority of the inhabitants thereof.' 
These resolutions settled the question. September 15, 1796, Wash- 
ington wrote to Governor Brooke that after careful inquiries to ascer- 
tain the place in the upper country most convenient to a majority of its 
inhabitants, he has destined the James River shares to the use of Lib. 
erty Hall Academy, in Rockbridge County.? We accordingly find this 
item in his will: 
The 100 shares which I hold in the James River Company I have given, and now 
confirm in perpetuity, to and for the use and benefit of Liberty Hall Academy, in the 
county of Rockbridge, in the Commonwealth of Virginia.? 
Before the disposition of the shares in the improvement companies 
was finally closed, Washington was called upon to consider the boldest 
scheme recorded in our educational history. The faculty of the College 
of Geneva, Switzerland, were ill at ease under the political conditions 
then existing in that country growing out of the French Revolution, 
and one or more of its members originated the brilliant proposal of 
mnigrating in a body to the United States, provided suitable encourage- 
ment were offered. In a word, it was a proposition to transplant to 
America one of the most famous of European seats of learning. In 
view of the facts already stated, it was natural that the scheme should 
be laid before Washington. It reached him by two different channels. 
John Adams, while on foreign duty, had become acquainted with M. 
D’Ivernois, one of the professors of the college, and he was very appro- 
priately made a medium for transmitting the Genevan idea. Adams 
submitted the papers to Washington, and Washington replied under 
date of November 27, 1794, neither accepting nor declining the proposi- 
tion.* 
Thomas Jefferson, while minister at Paris, had also made M. D’Iver- 
nois’s acquaintance. He was known to be deeply interested in science 
and in the College of Geneva, and was also in close sympathy with 
French ideas and the French spirit. Very naturally, the Genevan 
professor sounded him also on the subject. More definitely, he pro-

%Augusta Academy was founded by the Hanover Presbytery, at Mount Pleasant, about the year 
1772. After a few years, it was located at Lexington and its name changed to Liberty Hall Academy. 
Later its name was changed to Washington College, and still later to Washington and Lee Univer 
sity. The legislature has watched carefully over Washington's donation, and it now yields 6 per cent on $50,000, See a sketch of the institution in H. B. Adams's “Thomas Jefferson and the University of

  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1301 
posed the transplantation of the college to Virginia and to Jefferson’s 
own county. November 22, 1794, Jefferson laid the scheme before Wil- 
son Nicholas, a member of the Virginia assembly, requesting him to con- 
sult privately such members of the assembly as he thought proper, and 
then to follow his own judgment in the premises. Jefferson spoke of the 
expense and of the difficulty of communicating instruction to American 
youth in French and Latin, but added that owing to his long absence 
from the State he was not a competent judge of the force of these 
objections.! In due time Nicholas informed him that a canvass had 
been made, and that the scheme was pronounced impracticable. Mr, 
Jefferson accordingly explained the situation to M. D’Ivernois in a let- 
ter dated February 6, 17952 __ 
Apparently, this should have been the end of this extravagant proj- 
ect. But Jefferson now bethought him of the fund that Washington 
held in trust for an educational purpose; and February 23 he wrote the 
President an extremely interesting letter in relation to the subject, 
sketching the members of the Genevan faculty, one by one, and discuss- 
ing the question of removal, especially in its economical aspect. He 
thinks that if Washington will devote the shares to the carrying out of 
the scheme, it will give it “in the outset such an eclat, and such solid 
advantages, as would insure a very general concourse to it of the youths 
from all our States, and probably from the other parts of America 
which are free to adopt it.”* It is perfectly clear that Mr. Jefferson 
did not think the scheme impracticable. Still, he did not indorse the 
proposition in the terms that D’Ivernois had made it. He wrote: 
The composition of the academy can not be settled there. It must be adapted to 
our circumstances, and can therefore only be fixed between them and persons here 
acquainted with those circumstances, and conferring for the purpose after their 
arrival here. Fora country so marked by agriculture as ours, I should think no 
professorship so important as one not mentioned by them, a professor of agriculture, 
who, before students should leave college, should carry them through a course of 
lectures on the principles and practice of agriculture; and that this professor should 
come from no country but England. Indeed, I should mark Young as the man to be 
obtained. These, however, are modifications to be left till their arrival here. 
The reply that he received, dated March 15, left him in no doubt 
as to Washington’s view of its practicability. After recounting the 
advantages that would accrue to the national university from locating 
itin the Federal city, and stating that he has already decided to devote 
the James River shares to some Virginia seminary, Washington con- 
tinues thus: 
Hence you will perceive that I have in a degree anticipated your proposition. I 
was restrained from going the whole length of the suggestion by, the following con- 
siderations: First, 1 did not know to what extent or when any plan would be so 
matured for the establishment of a university as would enable any assurances to be 
given to the application of M. D’Ivernois. Secondly, the propriety of transplant- 
ing the professors in a body might be questioned for several reasons; among others,

because they might not all be good characters, nor all sufficiently acquainted with 
our language. And again, having been at variance with the leveling parties of 
their own country, the measure might be considered as an aristocratical movement 
by more than those who, without any just cause that I can discover, are continually 
sounding the bell of aristocracy. And, thirdly, because it might preclude some of 
the first professors in other countries from a participation, among whom some of the 
most celebrated characters in Scotland, in this line, might be obtained.! 
But on one point Washington expressed himself more fully #0 Adams 
than he did to Jefferson. 
My opinion with respect to emigration is that, except of useful mechanics and some 
particular descriptions of men or professions, there is no need of encouragement; 
while the policy or advantage of its taking place in a body (I mean the settling of 
them in a body) may be much questioned; for by so doing they retain the language, 
habits, and principles, good or bad, which they bring with them. Whereas, by an 
intermixture with our people they or their descendants get assimilated to our cus- 
toms, measures, and laws; in a word, soon become one people.” 
Our story now descends from the lofty heights to which M. D’Iver- 
nois and Mr. Jefferson have raised it, to its former prosaic level. 
As the year 1796 wore on, Washington was revolving in his mind his 
Farewell Address. Asis well known, he consulted Alexander Hamilton 
as to the substance and the style of this address. Writing September 
1, he expressed his regret at the omission from a rough draft that he 
had previously transmitted to Hamilton of a subject in which he was 
deeply interested. 
I mean education generally, as one of: the surest means of enlightening and giving 
just ways of thinking to our citizens, but particularly*the establishment of a uni- 
versity, where the youth from all parts of the United States might receive the 
polish of erndition in the arts, sciences, and belles-lettres;.and where those who 
were disposed to run a political course might not only be instructed in the theory 
and principles, but (this seminary being at the seat of the General Government) 
where the Legislature would be in session half the year, and the interests and poli- 
ties of the nation of course would be discussed, they would lay the surest founda- 
tion for the practical part also. 
But that which would render it of the highest importance, in my opinion, is, that 
the juvenal period of life, when friendships are formed, and habits established, that 
stick by one, the youth or young men from different parts of the United States 
would be assembled together, and would by degrees discover that there was not that 
cause for those jealousies and prejudices which one part of the Union had imbibed 
against another part—of course, sentiments of more liberality in the general policy of 
the country would result from it. Whatbutthe mixing of people from different parts 
of the United States during the war rubbed off these impressions? A century, in 
the ordinary intercourse, would not have accomplished what the seven years’ asso- 
ciation in arms did; but that ceasing, prejudices are beginning to revive again, and 
neyer will be eradicated so effectually by any other means as the intimate inter- 
course of characters in early lifé, who, in all probability, will be-at the head of the 
counsels of this country in a more advanced stage of it. 
To show that this is no new idea of mine, I may appeal to my early communica- 
tions to Congress; and to prove how seriously I have feflected on it since, and how 
well disposed I have been, and still am, te contribute my aid toward carrying the 
measure into effect, I inclose you an extract of a letter from me to the governor of 
Virginia on this subject, and a copy of the resolves of the legislature of that State 
in’ consequence thereof.

I have not the smallest doubt that this donation (when the navigation is in com- 
plete operation, which it certainly will be in less than two years) will amount to 
1,200 or 1,500 pounds sterling a year, and become a rapidly increasing fund. The 
proprietors of tho Federal City have talked of doing something handsome toward it 
likewise; and if Congress would appropriate some of the western lands to the same 
uses, funds sufficient, and of the most permanent and increasing sort, might be so 
established as to invite the ablest professors in Europe to conduct it.! 
Hamilton advised that it would be better to bring the university 
forward in the annual speech at the opening of the approaching ses- 
sion of Congress. In this view Washington acquiesced, though with 
some reluctance. He wrote the 6th of September: 
If you think that the idea of a university had better be reserved for the speech at 
the opening of the session, I am content to defer the communication of it until that 
period; but, even in that case, I would pray you, as soon a8 convenient, to make a 
draft for the occasion, predicated on the ideas with which you have been furnished ; 
looking, at the same time, into what was said on this head in my second speech to the 
First Congress, merely with a view to see what was said on the subject at that timo; 
and this, you will perceive, was not so much to the point as I want to express now, 
though it may, if proper, be glanced at, to show that the subject had caught my 
attention early. 
But, to be candid, I much question whether a recommendation of this measure to 
the Legislature will have a better effect now than formerly. It may show, indeed, 
my sense of its importance, and that is a sufficient inducement with me to bring the 
matter before the public in some shape or another at the closing scenes of my politi- 
eal exit. My object for proposing to insert it where I did (if not improper) was to 
set the people rnminating on the importance of the measure, as the most likely 
means of bringing it to pass.” 
The Farewell Address, accordingly, makes no mention of the univer- 
sity, but contains the golden sentences so often quoted: 
Promote as an object of primary importance institutions for the general diffusion 
of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of government gives force to public 
opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened. 
One of Washington’s favorite ideas was the establishment of a mili- 
tary school. He remembered vividly the almost total lack of educated 
American officers in the Revolutionary army, especially of engineers, 
and also the sore embarrassments growing out of the influx of foreign 
officers. In 1793 he had recommended to Congress as a “ national 
feature of the military system to be created the provision of an oppor- 
tunity fer the study of those branches of the military art which can 
scarcely ever be attained by practice alone;” and he now brought the 
two ideas forward in his last annual speech to Congress, delivered 
December 7, 1796. He devotes two paragraphs to the university. 
The assembly to which I address myself is too enlightened not to be fully sensible 
how much a flourishing state of the arts and sciences contributes to national pros- 
perity and reputation. True it is that our country, much to its honor, contains many 
seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful; but the funds upon which they 
rest are too narrow to command the ablest professors, in the different departments 
of liberal knowledge, for the institution contemplated, though they would be excel- 
lent auxiliaries.

Amongst the motives to such an institution, the assimilation of the principles, 
opinions, and manners of our countrymen, by the common education of a portion of 
our youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more homogeneous our 
citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be our prospects of per- 
manent union; and a primary object of such a national institution should be the 
education of our youth in the science of government. In a republic, what species 
of knowledge can be equally important, and what duty more pressing on its legisla- 
ture, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those who are to be the future 
guardians of the liberties of the country.! 
The fears that Washington expressed to Hamilton were fully justified 
by the event. Congress treated the university as it had done before— 
with silence. ; 
In his will Washington fully relates the history of the shares in the 
navigation companies that he held; he also argues at some length the 
university question, expressing once more his regret that American 
youth should resort to foreign countries in quest of education; and 
then disposes of the Potomac shares in this item: 
I give and bequeath, in perpetuity, the 50 shares which I hold in the Potomac 
Company (under the aforesaid acts of the legislature of Virginia), toward the 
endowment of a university, to be established within the limits of the District of 
Columbia, under the auspices of the General Government, if that Government should 
incline to extend a fostering hand toward it; and, until such a seminary is estab- 
lished, and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my 
further will and desire is, that the profit accruing therefrom shall, whenever divi- 
dends are made, be laid out in purchasing stock in the Bank of Columbia, or some 
other bank, at the discretion of my executors, or by the Treasurer of the United 
States for the time being, under the direction of Congress; provided that honorable 
body should patronize the measure; and the dividends proceeding from the purchase 
of such stock are to be vested in more stock, and so on, until a sum adequate to the 
accomplishment of the object is obtained; of which I have not the smallest doubt 
before many years pass away, even if no aid or encouragement is given by legisla- 
tive authority, or from any other source.? 
The executing of his will was Washington’s last act in relation to a 
university. Congress took no steps to make the above provisions 
effectual. Dr. Goode says: “The value of the bequest was at the time 
placed at 5,000 pounds sterling, and it was computed by Blodget that, 
had Congress kept faith with Washington, as well as did the legislature 
of Virginia in regard to the endowment of Washington College, his 
donation at compound interest would in twelve years (1815) have grown 
to $50,000 and in twenty-four years (1827) to $100,000, an endowment 
sufficient to establish one of the colleges in the proposed university.” 
The Potomac stock paid but one dividend. Still, the Chesapeake and 
Ohio Canal, and later the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were develop- 
ments of the project. Dr. H. B. Adams suggests that “the actual fate 
of Washington’s endowment of a national university would be a good 
subject for a Congressional inquiry, when other scientific subjects are 
exhausted.” *

  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1305 
Such is the history of Washington’s connection with the proposed 
university. It is but a part, however, of his whole relation to the sub- 
ject of higher education. The facts recited suggest some reflections. 
First, it is apparent that the national university idea attracted con- 
siderable attention when our present Government was in process of 
establishment. It seems, in fact, to have been quite commonly assumed 
that such an institution would be established when the fitting time 
came. Some may read between the lines that small, provincial ideas 
prevailed a century ago. Not only Washington’s ideas but also Jeffer- 
son’s may appear strangely inadequate as respects ways and. means, 
But we must remember that the whole scale of things has increased 
enormously in one hundred years, and that ideas which were then 
Jarge are to-day small. The point at which Washington was most at 
variance with current practice was his strong objection to sending 
American youth abroad to study. Very clearly, he did not see that his 
plan for keeping them at home would, in the long run, be the surest 
means of sending them abroad. But here, again, conditions have 
greatly changed. No man could then foresee, what experience has 
thus far proved, that the better and more numerous American univer- 
sities became, the larger the number of students who would flock to 
those of Europe. Even Jefferson wrote, after studying foreign educa- 
tional institutions, that, besides speaking the modern languages, every 
article of general education desirable for an American youth to have 
could be as well acquired at William and Mary College as in any place 
in Europe. 
Il. LETTERS OF DR. RUSH. 
Just how much interest there was at the time in the university prop- 
osition it would be hard to say. Dr. Goode prints as an appendix to 
his monograph an able letter that appeared in The Pennsylvania 
Gazette of November 29, 1788, in which the writer, who is thought to 
have been Dr. Benjamin Rush, not only elaborates a “‘Plan of a Fed- 
eral university,” which is his title, but argues that the new Constitu- 
tion can succeed only through an education adapted to the new and 
peculiar condition of the country, and insists that a national establish- 
ment is essential to that end. “To effect that great and necessary 
work,” he says, ‘‘let one of the first acts of the new Congress be to 
establish within the district to be allotted to them a Federal univer- 
sity, into which the youth of the United States shall be received after 
they have finished their studies and taken degrees in the colleges of 
their respective States. In this university let those branches of liter- 
ature only be taught which are calculated to prepare our youth for 
public and civil life.” This earnest paragraph may be quoted entire: 
Let it not be said that this is not the time for such a literary and political estab- 
lishment. Let us first restore public credit by funding or paying our debts; let us 
regulate our militia, let us build a navy, and let us protect and extend our com- 
merce. After that we shall have leisure and money to establish a university for the
-P-A-G-E-88
  1306 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
purposes that have been mentioned. This is false reasoning. We shall never restore 
public credit, regulate our militia, build a navy, or revive our commerce until we 
remove the ignorance and prejudices and change the habits of our citizens; and this 
can never be done until we inspire them with Federal principles, which can only be 
effected by our young men meeting and spending two or three years together ina 
national university, and afterwards disseminating their knowledge and principles 
through every county, town, and village in the United States. Until this is done, 
Senators and Representatives of the United States, you will undertake to make 
brick without straw. Your sepposed union in Congress will be a rope of sand. The 
inhabitants of Massachusetts began the business of government by establishing the 
University of Cambridge, and the wisest kings of Europe have always found their 
literary institutiens the surest means of establishing their power as well as promot- 
ing the prosperity of their people. 
      
However, this was nét the first time that Dr. Rush had spoken upon 
the subject. Dr. Geode reprints from Niles’s Principles and Acts of 
the Revolution in America an “Address to the people of the United 
States” that Rush had published in 1787. This address begins: “There 
is nothing more common than to confound the terms of the American 
Revolution with those of the late American war. The American war is 
over, but this is far from being the case with the American Revolution.” 
Here, too, he pleads for the dissemination of knowledge throughout 
every part of the United States; for “this purpose,” he says, “let Con- 
gress, instead of laying out half a million of dollars in building a Fed- 
eral town, appropriate only a fourth of that sum in founding a Federal 
university.” His closing words are, “The Revolution is not over.” 
IV. THE FIRST PRESIDENT ADAMS. 
The first President Adams was in thorough sympathy with all rea- 
sonable efforts to advance learning and science. His writings abound 
in interesting passages relating to the subject of education. Nor was 
he restrained from urging a national university by any constitutional 
theories. Still, the only utterance on the subject that I have found 
in his varions addresses to Congress is contained in Ins inaugural 
address. This is a strong avowal of “a love of science and letters, 
and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools, col- 
leges, universities, academies, and every institution for propagating 
knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the people, not 
only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages 
and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the only means of 
preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the spirit of 
sophistry, the spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the profligacy of 
corruption, and the pestilence of foreign influence, which is the angel 
of destruction to elective governments.” Adams’s administration was 
a troubled one, and he may have been restrained by a conviction that 
no mere recommendation of his on such a matter would avail. He 
was familiar, too, with the ill success that had attended Washington’s 
efforts, although they were enforced by a proffered endowment. Be- 
sides, his addresses to Congress were brief and his recommendations 
few in number.
-P-A-G-E-89
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1307 
V. PRESIDENT JEFFERSON, 
If any President could have identified his name with a real national 
university, undoubtedly it was Thomas Jefferson. He was borne into 
the Presidential chair by a powerful and enthusiastic party, well 
accustomed to follow his leadership. The Federal city was now estab- 
lished, and the national revenues increased beyond the wants of the 
Government. Since 1787 the expectation had been more or less gen- 
eral that a university would be established when the propitious time 
should arrive, and for several years at the beginning of the century 
this expectation was materially strengthened. In many respects Mr. 
Jefferson was the very man to take up and press the plan that Wash- 
ington had laid down only with his life. He was one of the most liberal- 
minded Americans of the day. His interest in science was so great 
that he protested time and again his strong preference for study and 
investigation to the strifes of polities. He held advanced views on 
higher education. Years before, in company with Chancellor Wythe, he 
had matured and brought ferward an elaborate plan for the establish- 
ment of asystem of public schoolsin Virginia. He had carefully studied 
the subject of education abroad. He had warmly espoused the Geneva 
removal scheme. And he was yet to found the University of Virginia. 
This he considered one of his three chief titles to remembrance, the 
other two being the authorship of the Declaration of Independence and 
the establishment of religious liberty in Virginia. It verily seemed to 
many that now, since science and philosophy had ascended to the Chief 
Magistrate’s chair, the propitious time to found the national university 
had come. All such expectations were cruelly disappointed. Mr. Jef: 
ferson mentioned the subject but once in his various communications to 
Congress. In his sixth annual message, delivered September 2, 1806, 
discussing the state of the public finances, he said there would be “ere 
long an accumulation of moneys in the Treasury beyond the installments 
of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay,” and asked 
what should be done with the surplus. He thought the publie would . 
not consent to a large reduction of revenue, but rather insist upon its 
“continuance and application to the great purposes of public education, 
roads, rivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as 
it may be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of 
Federal powers.” He thus continues: 
Edueation is here placed among the articles of public care, not that it would be 
proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise, which 
manages so much better all the concerns to which it is equal; but a public institu- 
tion can alone supply those sciences which, though rarely called for, are yet necessary 
to complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of the 
country, and some of them to its preservation. The subject is now proposed for the 
consideration of Congress, because, if approved, by the time the State legislatures 
shall have deliberated on this extension of the Federal trusts, and the laws shall be 
passed and other arrangements made for their execution, the necessary funds will be 
on hand and without employment. I suppose an amendment to the Constitution, by  
-P-A-G-E-90
  1308 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
consent of the States, necessary, because the objects now recommended are not 
among those enumerated in the Constitution, and to which it permits public moneys 
to be applied. 
The present consideration of a national establishment for education, particularly, 
is rendered proper by this vircumstance also, that if Congress, approving the pro- 
position, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands, they 
have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the earliest 
to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage of 
being independent of war, which may suspend other improvements by requiring for 
its own purposes the resources destined for them. 
This feeble outcome will not surprise anyone who is acquainted with 
the facts of the case. There is no reason to suppose that Mr. Jefferson 
was at any time interested in a national university in the sense that 
Washington or Madison was interested init. His sincere devotion to 
education is unquestioned; but he wished to gain his ends rather 
through State than United States agencies. In fact, his idea in urging 
the Genevan scheme was Virginian rather than national, as his letter 
to Washington shows. Withal, his constitutional theories stcod in his 
way. His mere mention that a constitutional amendment would be 
necessary before any portion of the surplus revenue could be devoted 
to a university was quite enough to put an end for the time to the 
undertaking! 
Vi. JOEL BARLOW’S PLANS. 
In 1800 Joel Barlow, poet, politician, and speculator, but then min- 
ister in Paris, wrote Senator Baldwin, of Georgia, urging a national 
scientific institution, of which he proposed that he should be made the 
head. He wrote to Mr. Jefferson urging the same proposition. In 1805 
Barlow returned home, and almost immediately issued his “ Prospectus 
of a national institution to be establislied in the United States.” This 
prospectus begins with the declaration: “The project for erecting a 
university at the seat of the Federal Government is brought forward 
at the happy moment and on liberal principles.” It is a review of the 
state of learning and science in Europe, with accounts of the educa- 
tional and scientific institutions supportee by various governments, and 
especially by that of France. Then follows Barlow’s own plan of an 
institution for the United States, drawn upon the most liberal scale. 
The paper closes with a strong appeal to Congress and to “opulent citi- 
zens” to make a liberal endowment for so great an object. Too much 
time has already been lost. The National Intelligencer, the Adminis- 
‘Mr. Jefferson seems to have thought that the proposition to amend the Constitution in favor of the 
university would meet with an immediate response. In a letter to Mr. Gallatin, Secretary of the 
‘Treasury, relative to the message of 1806, he wrote: “The university.—This proposition will pass 
all the States in the winter of 1807-8, and Congress will not meet, and consequently can not act on 
it, till the winter of 1808-9. The Florida debt will therefore be paid off before the university can call 
for anything.” Gallatin replied two days later that the proposition would certainly be unpopular, 
while public works would be popular. ‘I think, indeed,” he said, ‘that the only chance of the 
adoption arises from the ease with which funds in the public lands may be granted.” Adams: The 
Writings of Albert Gallatin, I, 313-319. It is needless to say which one of the two men had read 
public sentiment more correctly.
-P-A-G-E-91
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY, 1309 
tration organ, commented favorably upon Barlow’s scheme. The pros- 
pectus was circulated throughout the country, meeting with much favor. 
Barlow drew up a bill for the incorporation of the institution which, 
introduced into the Senate, passed to a second reading, was referred to 
a committee, and never heard of again.! 
VII. PRESIDENT MADISON. 
On becoming President, Mr, Madison did not forget the interest he 
had taken in the university twenty years before. On this subject, at 
least, he did not share Mr, Jefferson’s constitutional views. He had no 
tronble in finding constitutional authority for a national university in 
the Federal district. Three times he brought the proposition forward. 
In his second annual message he said: 
While it is universally admitted that a well-instructed people alone can be perma- 
nently a free people, and while it is evident that the means of diffusing and improv- 
ing useful knowledge form so small a proportion of the expenditures for national 
purposes, I can not presume it to be unreasonable to invite your attention to the 
advantages of superadding to the means of education provided by the several 
States a seminary of learning instituted by the National Legislature, within the 
limits of their exclusive jurisdiction, the expense of which might be defrayed or 
reimbursed out of the vacant grounds which have accrued to the nation within 
those limits. 
Such an institution, though local in its legal character, would be universal in its 
beneficial effects. By enlightening the opinions, by expanding the patriotism, and 
by assimilating the principles, the sentiments, and the manners of those who might 
resort to this temple of science, to be redistributed in due time through every part 
of the community, sources of jealousy and prejudice would be diminished, tho 
features of national character would be multiplied, and greater extent given to 
social harmony. But above all, a well-constituted seminary, in the center of the 
nation, is recommended by the consideration that the additional instruction emanat- 
ing from it would contribute not less to strengthen the foundations than to adorn 
the structure of our free and happy system of government. 
The war with England over, President Madison in 1817 returned to 
the subject. He said in his seventh annual message: 
The present is a favorable season, also, for bringing again into view the establish- 
ment of a national seminary of learning within the District of Columbia, and with 
means drawn from the property therein, subject to the authority of the General 
Government. Such an institution claims the patronage of Congress as a monument 
of their solicitude for the advancement of knowledge without which the blessings 
of liberty can not be fully enjoyed or long preserved; as a model instructive in the 
formation of other seminaries; as a nursery of enlightened preceptors; as a central 
resort of youth and genius from every part of their country, diffusing on their 
return examples of those national feelings, those liberal sentiments, and those con- 
genial manners, which contribute cement to our union and strength to the political 
fabric of which that is the foundation. 
And again in his last annual message he said: 
The importance which I have attached to the establishment of a university within 
this District, on a scale and for objects worthy of the American Nation, induces me 
to renew my recommendation of it to the favorable consideration of Congress.

  1310 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
And I particularly invite again their attention to the expediency of exercising their 
existing powers, and, where necessary, of resorting to the prescribed mode of enlarg- 
ing them, in order to effectuate a comprehensive system of roads and canals, such 
as will have the effect of drawing more closely together every part of our country 
by promoting intercourse and improvements, and by increasing the share of every 
part in the common stock of national prosperity. 
  VIII. PRESIDENT MONROE. 
Mr. Monroe shared the constitutional scruples of Mr. Jefferson. In 
his first message he recommended such amendment of the Constitution 
as would admit of internal improvements being made by Congfess. 
He flattered himself that “the benign spirit of conciliation and har- 
mony” prevailing throughout the Union promised to such a recom- 
mendation the most prompt and favorable result. He added: 
I think proper to suggest, also, in case this measure is adopted, that it be recom- 
mended to the States to include in the amendment sought a right in Congress to 
institute, likewise, seminaries of learning, for the all-important purpose of diffusing 
knowledge among our fellow-citizens throughout the United 
  IX. THE SECOND PRESIDENT ADAMS. 
The second President Adams, in breadth of intellectual attainments 
and sympathies, was inferior to no man who has filled the Presidential 
office. He had acted for many years with the Virginia school of poli- 
tics, but he did not reyard their constitutional subtleties. He was, in 
fact, a broad constructionist, holding large views on all subjects of a 
national character. As Secretary of State he had made a celebrated 
report on weights and measures, which is still considered one of the 
most valuable documents on that subject ever written. As the recom- 
mendations of that report had not been cnacted into law, he naturally 
took cccasion, in his first annual message, to draw the attention of 
Congress to the subject again, connecting it with the profound, labori- 
ous, and expensive researches into the figure of theearth and the com- 
parative length of the pendulum vibrating seconds in various latitudes 
from the equator to the poles which had been made in Europe. He 
thought it would be honorable to the country to share in these inv esti- 
gations, and as a means of making this possible he went on to saj 
  Connected with the establishment of a university, or separate from it, might be 
undertaken the erection of an astronomical observatory, with provision for the sup- 
port of an astronomer, to be in constant attendance of observation upon the phe- 
nomena of the heavens, and for the periodical publication of his observations. It is 
with no feeling of pride, as an American, that the remark may be made that on the 
comparatively small territorial surface of Europe there are existing upward of 130 
of these light-houses of the skies, while throughout the whole American hemi- 
sphere there is not one. If we reflect moment upon the discoveries which in the 
last four centuries have been made in the physical constitution of the universe, by 
the means of these buildings and of observers stationed in them, shall we doubt of 
their usefulness to every nation? And while scarcely a year passes over our heads 
without bringing some new astronomical discovery to light, which we must fain 
receive at secondhand from Europe, are we not cutting ourselves off from the means
-P-A-G-E-93
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1311 
of returning light for light, while we have neither observatory nor observer upon 
our half of the globe, and the earth revolves in perpetual darkness to our unsearch- 
ing eyes? 
He referred in fitting terms to the interest that his first predecessor 
had taken in institutions and seminaries of learning, saying that if he 
could now survey the city which had been honored with his name, he 
would see the spot of earth which he had destined and bequeathed to 
the use and benefit of his country as the site for a university still bare 
and barren. 
If possible, John Quincy Adams’s recommendations had less weight 
with Congress than his father’s had had, and this one was perhaps the 
least fortunate of all. It was received with shouts of derisive merri- 
ment that show, not merely the furious partisan rancor of 1825, but 
also the low state of science in the United States, With March 4, 
1829, American politics teck a new departure, and the national uni- 
versity passed out of sight. The first six Presidents had recommended 
such an institution more or less warmly, and it is painful to think that, 
whatever its merits, it should have expired amid the inextinguishable 
laughter with which the recommendation of a ‘“light-house in the skies” 
was greeted. 
The main purpose of the compiler of these documents is to exhibit 
the views of the early Presidents concerning a national university, and 
not te give a full history of the subject. Those who wish to pursue 
the subject more fally are referred to the bibliography following the 
documents. Dr. F. W. Blackmar, in his Federal and State Aid to 
Higher Hducation, tells us that in 1796 a memorial was before Congress 
praying for the foundation of a university; that again in 1811 the sub- 
ject was considered by a Congressional committee, which reported that 
it would be unconstitutional for Congress to found, endow, and control 
such a seminary; and that another Congressional committee considered 
the subject in 1816, but with no practical results, (His references are 
Ex. Doc. Fourth Congress, second session; Ex. Doc. Eleventh Con- 
gress, third session; Ex. Doc. Fourteenth Congress, second session.) 
He also remarks, as others have done, that Congress has founded and 
supported the National Museum, the Library of Congress, the National 
Observatory, and the Bureau of Education, which in some sense take 
the place of a university. In fact, the old National Observatory 
stood on “ University Square,” which Washington had chosen as the 
site of the university. Dr. Blackmar also draws attention to the fact 
that although the university question was considered practically settied 
after 1816, it was reopened for discussion when Congress came to dis- 
pose of the Smithson bequest, and again in 1873 following the Paris 
Exposition. At this time a bill was before the House of Representa- 
tives providing for a university at Washington, endowed by Congress 
to the amount of $20,000,000, yielding 5 per cent interest, the income 
to be used for buildings, furnishings, and for the general support of

the institution. (House Report No. 89, Forty-second Congress, third 
session, 90.) 
Mention may be made of the bill introduced into the United States 
Senate by Hon. George F. Edmunds, May 14, 1890, entitled “A bill to 
establish the university of the United States.” This bill was read 
twice and referred to a select committee of nine. Also of a bill 
entitled “(A bill to establish a national university,” introduced into the 
Senate by Hon. Redfield Proctor, February 4, 1893, read twice and 
referred to a special committee.

The provisions of the State constitutions concerning schools and 
education, from 1776 to the present time, form an interesting chapter in 
the history both of American jurisprudence and of American education. 
They are the legal foundations of our State school systems. It is pro- 
posed in this section to bring all these provisigns together in such a
-P-A-G-E-95

manner as to illustrate fully the development of this important branch 
of our educational history. This object will be best gained by follow- 
ing, in the main, the chronological order in which these provisions were 
enacted. It will be convenient also to present the subject under cer- 
tain heads, determined by certain important facts. 
In May, 1776, the American Congress recommended the assembles 
and conventions of the States where the existing governments were 
not sufficient for the exigencies of their affairs “to adopt such govern- 
ment as shall, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best 
conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular 
and Americain general.” In pursuance of this recommendation, which 
was plainly necessitated by the lapse of events, all the States but Con- 
necticut and Rhode Island, which considered their colonial charters 
amply sufficient for present exigencies, proceeded to frame State con- 
stitutions; some of them very rudimentary and imperfect, but others 
well thought out and elaborated. Several of these States, finding their 
first constitutions inadequate to the purposes of government, were com- 
pelled almost immediately either to frame new ones or to make impor- 
tant amendments. Again, before any new educational forces or interests 
began to act or appear, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee came into 
the Union. These various constitutions are no mean criterion of the 
conditions of popular education in the several States, as well in those 
that did not recognize education at all as in those that made some 
provision for it. Furthermore, the fuller realization of a national con- 
“sciousness following the organization of the Government under the 
Constitution of 1787 led to a general quickening of the pulses of 
national life. An historian of the time has said: 
No sooner had the war for independence ended, and the Government of the United 
States been placed on a settled basis by the adoption of the Constitution; no sooner 
had the national life begun to flow in its new channels, than there was a great 
advance along all the lines of denominational activity and educational enterprise. 
Everything which before had been carried on in scattered, sporadic methods now 
tended to organization. Boards of foreign and home missions were established; 
Bible and tract societies were organized; theological seminaries were founded; new 
colleges were planted, and the older institutions more liberally endowed; the reli- 
gious press was multiplied; associations for moral reform were instituted. The first 
half of this century was prolific in all these movements.” 
In making extracts from the State constitutions, “The Federal and 
State constitutions, colonial charters,” ete., compiled under an order of 
the United States Senate by Ben: Perley Poore, Washington, Govern- 
ment Printing Office, 1878, has been followed to the date of publica- 
tion. Great pains has been taken to make the compilation as complete 
as possible, but some unimportant provisions have perhaps escaped 
observation. The date on which a constitution or an amendment took 
effect has been given in every case where it could be ascertained from 
documents at hand. : :

The state of affairs in Vermont frony 1776 to 1791 was anomalous. 
At the first of those dates. Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and New 
York each claimed in whole or in part the territory at present compris- 
ing that State. The people asserted their independence of all these 
States, as well as of England, and strove to be admitted to the Union 
as.an independent State, Massachusetts assented in.1781, New Hamp- 
shire in 1782, New York in 1790, and Vermont became the fourteenth 
State in 1791. In this period two constitutions were framed, each of 
which was declared by the legislature to be a part of the laws of the 
State, and appears to have been so regarded by the people. The first 
of these constitutions contains. the twe folowing propositions.. This is

Tun ConsTiTUTION OF MassacnusErrs, JUNE 157H,! 1780. 
[Part II, Chap. V, The University at. Cambridge, and. Encouragement of Literature, etc.] 
Section 1.—The university. 
Anr. 1. Whereas. our wise and pious: ancestors, so early as the year 1636, laid 
the foundation of Harvard College, in which university many persons of great 
eminence have, by the blessing of God, been initiated in those arts and sciences 
which qualified them for public employments, both in church and state; and whereas 
the encouragement of arts and sciences and all good literature, tends to the honor 
of Ged, the advantage of the Christian religion, and the great benefit of this and 
the other United States of America, it is declared, that the president and fellows. of 
Harvard College, in their corporate capacity, and their successors in that capacity, 
their officers and servants, shall have, hold, use, exercise, and enjoy all the powers, 
authorities, rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and franchises which they now 
have, or are entitled to have, hold, use, exercise, and enjoy; and the same are hereby 
ratified and confirmed unto them, the said president and fellows of Harvard College, 
and to their successors, and to their officers.and servants respectively,. forever. 
Arr. 2, And whereas there have been, at sundry times, by divers persons, gifts, 
grants, devises of howses, lands, tenements, goods, chattels, legacies, and convey- 
ances heretofore made, either to Harvard College, in Cambridge, in New England, 
or to the president and fellows of Harvard College, or to the said college by some 
other description, under several charters successively, it is declared that- all the 
said gifts, grants, devises, legacies, and. conveyances are hereby forever confirmed: 
unto the president and fellows of Harvard College, and to their successors, in the 
capacity aforesaid, according to the true intent and meaning of the donor or donors, 
grantor or grantors, devisor or devisors. 
Arr, 3. And whereas by an act of the general court of the colony of Massa- 
chusetts Bay, passed in the year 1642, the governor and deputy governor, for the 
time being, and all the magistrates of that jurisdiction, were, with the. president, 
and a number of the clergy, in the said act described, constituted the overseers of 
Harvard College, and it being necessary, in this. new constitution of government, to 
ascertain who shall be deemed successors to the said governor, deputy governor, and 
magistrates, it is declared that the governor, lieutenant-governor, council, and senate 
of this Commonwealth are, and shall be deemed, their successors; who, with the pres- 
ident of Harvard College, for the time being, together with the ministers of the Con- 
gregational churches in the towns of Cambridge, Watertown, Charlestown,, Boston, 
Roxbury and Dorchester, mentioned in the said act, shall be, and hereby are, vested 
with all the powers and authority belonging or in any way. appertaining to the over- 
seers of Harvard College: Provided, That nothing herein shall be construed to pre- 
vent the. legislature of this Commonwealth from making, such alterations in the 
government of the said university as shall be conducive to-its advantage and the 
interest of the republic of letters, in as full a manner as might have been done by 
the legislature of the late province of the Massachusetts Bay. 
    Srctron 2.—The encouragement of literature. 
Cuar. V, Sec. 2. Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally 
among the body of the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights 
and liberties; and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and advantages 
of education in the various parts of the country, and among the different orders 
of the people, it shall be the duty of the legislatures and magistrates, in all future 
periods of this Commonwealth, to cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, _ 
and all seminaries of them; especially the university at Cambridge, public schools,

and grammar-schools in the towns; to encourage private societies and public insti- 
tutions, by rewards and immunities, for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, 
commerce, trades, manufactures, and a natural history of the country; to counte- 
- nance and inculcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and 
private charity, industry and frugality, honesty and punctuality in their dealings; 
sincerity, good humor, and all social affections and generous sentiments among the 
people. 
These are the only constitutional educational provisions of the Revo- 
lutionary period of which we have any particular history. For this 
reason, and also because the last section was reproduced in the consti- 
tutions of New Hampshire and Maine, in its essential features, that 
history is here given. It is found in the Life and Works of John 
Adams, edited by Charles Francis Adams, Vol. IV, p. 257. It is also 
worth remarking that this history is the earliest example of French 
influence upon our educational institutions. The American Academy 
of Arts and Sciences, Boston, was incorporated May 4, 1780. The 
similar institution at Philadelphia, dating from 1743, was known as the 
Philosophical Society. The one name was imported from Paris, the 
other from London. 
In traveling from Boston to Philadelphia, in 1774, 1775, 1776, and 1777, I had several 
times amused myself at Norwalk, Conn., with the very curious collection of birds and 
insects, of American production, made by Mr. Arnold, a collection which he afterwards 
sold to Governor Tryon, who sold it to Sir Ashton Lever, in whose apartments in 
London I afterwards viewed it again. This collection was so singular a thing that 
it made a deep impression on me, and I could not but consider it a reproach to my 
country that so little was known even to herself of her natural history. 
‘When I was in Europe in the years 1778 and 1779, in the commission to the King 
of France, with Dr. Franklin and Mr. Arthur Lee, I had opportunities to see the 
King’s collections and many others, which increased my wishes that nature might 
be examined and studied in my own country as it was in others. 
In France, among the academicians and other men of science and letters, I was 
frequently entertained with inquiries concerning the Philosophical Society at Phila- 
delphia, and with eulogiums on the wisdom of that institution and encomiums on 
some publications in their transactions. 
These conversations suggested to me the idea of such an establishment at Boston, 
where I knew there was as much love of science, and as many gentlemen who were 
capable of pursuing it, as in any other city of its size. 
In 1779 I returned to Boston in the French frigate La Sensible, with the Chevalier 
de la Luzerne and M. Marbois. The corporation of Harvard College gave a public 
dinner in honor of the French ambassador and bis suite, and did me the honor of an 
invitation to dine with them. At the table, in the philosophy chamber, I chanced 
to sit next to Dr. Cooper. I entertained him during the whole of the time we were 
together with an account of Arnold’s collections, the collections 1 had seen in Europe, 
the compliments I had heard in France upon the Philosophical Society at Phila- 
delphia, and concluded with proposing that the future legislature of Massachusetts 
should institute an academy of arts and sciences. 
The Doctor at first hesitated; thought it would be difficult to find members who 
would attend to it; but his principal objection was that it would injure Harvard 
College, by setting up a rival to it that might draw the attention and affections of 
the public in some degree from it. To this I answered, first, that there were cer- 
tainly men of learning enough that might compose a society sufficiently numerous; 
and, secondly, that instead of being a rival to the university it would be an honor 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. 1oLF 
and advantage to it; that the president and principal professors would no doubt be 
always members of it, and the meetings might be ordered wholly or in part at the 
college and in that room. The Doctor at length appeared better satisfied, and I 
entreated him to propagate the idea and the plan as far and as soon as his discretion 
would justify. The Doctor accordingly did diffuse the project so judiciously and 
effectually, that the first legislature under the new constitution adopted and estab- 
lished it by law. 
Afterwards, when attending the convention for framing the constitution, I men- 
tioned the subject to several of the members, and when I was appointed by the 
subcommittee to make a draft of a project of a constitution, to be laid before the 
convention, my mind and heart were so full of the subject that I inserted Chapter V, 
section 2, 
Iwas somewhat apprehensive that criticism and objections would be made to the 
section, and particularly that the ‘‘natural history” and the ‘good humor” would 
be stricken out, but the whole was received very kindly, and passed the convention 
unanimously without amendment. 
THE CONSTITUTION OF New HampsuHire, JUNE 2, 1784. 
New Hampshire was the first of the States to form a State constitu- 
tion. But the “civil government” adopted January 5, 1776, was very 
imperfect, and in 1784 gave place to one that was more complete. The 
first constitution made no reference to education. The following is the 
educational section of the second one, copied from the constitution of 
Massachusetts of 1780 with only two words changed. It was continued 
unchanged in the constitution of 1792, and has never been amended: 
Parr Il.—Encouragement of literature, etc. 
Suc. 83. Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a community being 
essential to the preservation of a free government, spreading the opportunities and 
advantages of education through the various parts of the country being highly con- 
ducive to promote this end, it shall be the duty of the legislatures and magistrates, 
in all future periods of this government, to cherish the interest of literature and 
the sciences, and all seminaries and public schools; to encourage private and public 
institutions, rewards and immunities for the promotion of agriculture, arts, sciences, 
commerce, trade, manufactures, and natural history of the country; to countenance 
and ineulcate the principles of humanity and general benevolence, public and pri- 
vate charity, industry and economy, honesty and punctuality, sincerity, sobriety, 
and all social affections and generous sentiments among the people. 
  THE CONSTITUTION OF VERMONT, MARCH, 1787. 
This scetion was also. incorporated in the constitution of 1793 
unchanged, and is still in force: 
Cuap. II, Suc. 38. Laws for the encouragement of virtue, and prevention of vice 
and immorality, ought to be constantly kept in force, and duly executed; and a 
competent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town for the conven- 
ient instruction of youth; and one or more grammar schools be incorporated, and 
properly supported in each county in this State. And all religious societies, or 
bodies of men, that may be hereafter united or incorporated, for the advancement 
of religion and learning, or for other pious and charitable purposes, shall be encour- 
aged and protected in the enjoyment of the privileges, immunities, and estates, 
which they in justice ought to enjoy under such regulations as the General Assembly 
of this State shall direct.

  Tue CONSTITUTION OF DELAWARE, JUNE, 1792. 
The first constitution of Delaware, which went into operation Sep- 
tember 21, 1776, was silent upon education. The following provision 
was inserted in the constitution of 1792, was continued in that of 1831 
(Art. VII, sec. 11), and is still in force: 
Art. VII, Src. 12. The Legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, provide 
by law, * * *, establishing schools, and promoting arts and sciences. 
   Tur CONSTITUTION OF TENNESSEE, FEBRUARY 6, 1796. 
Ant. I, Src. 24. No member of the general assembly shall be eligible to any office 
or place of trust, except to the office of a justice of the peace, or a trustee of any 
literary institution, where the power of appointment to such office or place of trust 
is vested in their own body.    
THE CONSTITUTION OF GEORGIA, OcroBER, 1798.! 
Art. IV, Src. 13. The arts and seiences shall be promoted, in one or more semi- 
naries of learning; and the legislature shall, as soon as conveniently may be, give 
such further donations and privileges to those already established as may be neces- 
sary to secure the objects of their institution; and it shall be the duty of the general 
assembly, at their next session, to provide effectual measures for the improyement 
and permanent.security of the funds and endowments of such institutions. 
The foregoing are all the educational provisions found in the consti- 
tutions of the period 1776-1802. Still, the following States formed con- 
stitutions at the dates given: New Jersey, 1776; Maryland, 1776; Vir- 
ginia, 1776; South Carolina, 1776, 1778, and 1790; New York, 1777; Ken- 
tucky, 1792 and 1799. Some of these constitutions were also amended 
within those years; that of Maryland was amended four times. The 
reason for the non-appearance of Connecticut and Rhode Island in this 
period has been already given. 
II. SECOND PERIOD, 1803-1835. 
Discussion; Ohio, 1803; Indiana, 1816; Mississippi, 1817; Illinois, 1818; Connecticut, 
1818; Alabama, 1819; Maine, 1820; New York, 1821; Missouri, 1821; Tennessee, 
1835. 
At the beginning of this period, two forces that have since power- 
fully affected education, and therefore State constitutions, first began 
to act. The first was the extension of population, especially the New 
England and Northern population, beyond the limits of the old States 
into the great West. The second was the Congressional land grants

tained any reference to education.

which has been given already. The reason for closing the period with 
the year 1835 will be given at the opening of the next period. 
THE CONSTITUTION OF OHIO, FEBRUARY 19, 1803.! 
This is the first of the constitutions to show the effect of the new 
forces: 
Arr, VIII. That the general, great, and essential principles of liberty and free gov- 
ernmeut may bo recognized, and forever unalterably established, we declare: * * * 
3. That all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship Almighty God, 
{here the rights of conscience and of religious worship are declared, and disqualifi- 
cations from office on account of religion forbidden.] But religion, thorality, and 
knowledge being essentially necessary to the good government and the happiness of 
mankind, schools and the means of instruction shall forever be encouraged by legis- 
lative provision not inconsistent with the rights of conscience. * * * 
25. That no law shall be passed to prevent the poor in the several counties and 
townships within this State from an equal participation in the schools, academies, 
colleges, and universities within this State, which are endowed, in whole or in part, 
from the revenues arising from the donations made by the United States for the sup- 
port of schools and colleges; and the doors of the said scheols, academies, and uni- 
yersities shall be open for the reception of scholars, students, and teachers of every 
grade, without any distinction or preference whatever, contrary to the intent for 
which the said donations were made. * * * ‘ 
27. That every association of persons, when regularly formed within this State, 
and haying given themselves a name, may, on application to the legislature, be 
entitled to receive letters of incorporation to enable them to hold estates, real and 
personal, for the support of their schools, academies, colleges, universities, and other 
purposes. 
Tne CONSTITUTION OF INDIANA, DECEMBER I1, 1816. 
Art, IX, Sec, 1. Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a communivy 
being essential to the preservation of a free government, and spreading the oppor- 
tunities and advantages of education through the various parts of the country being 
highly conducive to this end, it shall be the duty of the general assembly to provide 
by law for the improvement of such lands as are, or hereafter may be, granted by 
the United States to this State, for the use of schools, and to apply any funds which 
may be raised from such lands, or from:any other quarter, to the accomplishment of 
the grand object for which they are or may be intended. But no lands granted for 
the use of schools or seminaries of learning shall be sold, by authority of this State, 
prior to the year 1820; and the moneys which may be raised out of the sale of any 
such lands, or otherwise obtained, for the purposes aforesaid, shall be and remain a 
fund for the exclusive purpose of promoting the interests of literature and the sci- 
ences, and for the support of seminaries and public schools. The general assembly 
shall, from time to time, pass such laws as shall be calculated to encourage intel- 
lectual, scientifical, and agricultural improvement by allowing rewards and immuni- 
ties for the promotion and improvement of arts, sciences, commerce, manufactures, 
and natural history; and to countenance and encourage the principles of humanity, 
industry, and morality. 
Src. 2. It shall be the duty of the general assembly, as soon as circumstances will 
permit, to provide by law for a general system of education, ascending in regular 
gradation from township schools to a State university, wherein tuition shall be gratis 
and equally open to all. 
1 This is the date of the admission of Ohio to the Union, according to the best authorities.

Sec, 3. And for the promotion of such salutary end, the money which shall be 
paid as an equivalent by persons exempt from militia duty, except in times of war, 
shall be exclusively, and in equal proportions, applied to the support of county semi- 
naries; also, all fines assessed for aity breach of the penal laws shall be applied to 
said seminaries in the counties wherein they shall be assessed. 
* * = * * # * 
Sec. 5. The general assembly, at the time they lay off a new county, shall cause 
at least 10 per cent. to be reserved out of the proceeds of the sale of town-lots in the 
seat of justice of such county for the use of a public library for such county; and 
at the same session they shall incorporate a library-company, under such rules and 
regulations as will best secure its permanence and extend its benefits. 
The foregoing provisions call for two observations. It is here that 
we meet the first attempt to throw constitutional safeguards around 
the lands granted by Congress to any State for an educational purpose. 
It is here also that we find the first constitutional command to a legis- 
lature to establish a system of State education, ascending from the 
primary school to the university, where instruction should be free and 
equally open to all. The first fact is referable to the growing impor- 
tance of the school lands in the public estimation, and the second one 
is due either to a quickening general interest in public education or to 
the presence in Indiana of farsighted statesmen. 
THE CONSTITUTION OF MISSISSIPPI, DECEMBER 10, 1817. 
This section (Art. VI) was continued in the constitutions of 1832 and 
1865 as Article VII, section 14: 
Src. 16. Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good government, 
the preservation of liberty, and the happiness of mankind, schools, and the means 
of education, shall forever be encouraged in this State. 
THE CONSTITUTION OF ILLINOIS, DECEMBER 3, 1818. 
This constitution did not mention the subject of education, but the 
accompanying ordinance contained full provisions respecting the school 
lands: 
Whereas the Congress of the United States, in an act entitled “An act to enable 
the people of the Illinois Territory to form a constitution and State government, and 
for the admission of such State into the Union on an equal footing with the original 
States,” passed the 18th of April, 1818, have offered to this convention, for their free 
acceptance or rejection, the following propositions, which, if accepted ‘by the con- 
vention, are to be obligatory upon the United States, viz: 
“Ist. That section numbered sixteen in every township, and, when such section 
has been sold or otherwise disposed of, other lands equivalent thereto and as con- 
tiguous as may be, shall be granted to the State, for the use of the inhabitants of 
such township for the use of schools. * * * 
«3d. That 5 per cent. of the net proceeils of the land lying within such State, and 
which shall be sold by Congress from and after the 1st day of January, 1819, after 
deducting all expense incident to the same, shall be reserved for the purposes follow- 
ing, viz: Two-fifths to be disbursed under the direction of Congress, in making 
_roads leading to the State; the residue to be appropriated by the legislature of the 
State for the encouragement of learning, of which one-sixth part shall be exclusively 
bestowed on a college or university.

ARTICLE VI.—Education. 
Schools, and the means of education, shall forever be encouraged in this State; 
and the general assembly shall take measures to preserve, from unnecessary waste 
or damage, such lands as are or hereafter may be, granted by the United States for 
the use of schools within each township in this State, and apply the funds, which 
may be raised from such lands, in strict conformity to the object of such grant. 
The general assembly shall take like measures for the improvement of such lands as 
have been or may be hereafter granted by the United States to this State, for the 
support of a seminary of learning, and the moneys which may be raised from such 
lands, by rent, lease, or sale, or from any other quarter, for the purpose aforesaid, 
shall be and remain a fund for the exclusive support of a State university, for the 
promotion of the arts, literature, and the sciences; and it shall be the duty of the 
general assembly, as early as may be, to provide effectual means for the improve- 
ment and permanent security of the funds and endowments of such institution. 
1An act for enlarging the powers and increasing the funds of Yale College,” appointed William 
Hart, John Trumbull, and Andrew Kingsbury as commissioners, to perform certain duties specified 
with regard to balances due to the State, which were appropriated to Yale College upon condition of 
the acceptance, on the part of the president and corporation, of certain modifications in their corporate 
powers, of which legal evidence was to be filed in the office of the secretary of state. 
An additional act was passed May, 1796, by which a claim of 50 per cent. of sums collected on cer- 
tain balances was relinquished to the college on condition that the latter should transfer $13,726.39 in 
deferred stock of the United States to the State treasurer. The president and corporation were by 
this act required to report annually to the general assembly an account of receipts and expenditures 
of the moneys belonging to the college. —H.

The following article is still in force: 
ARTICLE VIII.—Literature. 
A general diffusion of the advantages of education being essential to the promo- 
tion of the rights and liberties of the people, to promote this important object, the 
legislature are authorized, and it shall be their duty, to require the several towns 
to make suitable provision, at their own expense, for the support and maintenance 
of public schools, and it shall further be their duty to encourage and suitably endow, 
from time to time, as the circumstances of the people may authorize, all academies, 
colleges, and seminaries of learning within the State: Provided, That no donation, 
grant, or endowment shall at any time be made by the legislature to any literary 
institution now established, or which may be hereafter established, unless, at the 
time of making such endowment, the legislature of the State shall have the right to 
grant any further powers to alter, limit, or restrain any of the powers vested in any 
such literary institution as shall be judged necessary to promote the best interests 
thereof. 
The act of the general court of Massachusetts, which gave permission 
to the district of Maine to frame a constitution and to become an inde- 
pendent member of the Union, was made a part of said constitution. 
It provided that the grant which has been made to the president and 
trustees of Bowdoin College out of the tax laid upon the banks within 
this Commonwealth shall be charged upon the banks within the said 
district of Maine, and paid according to.the terms of said grant; and 
the president and trustees and the overseers of said college shall have, 
hold, and enjoy their powers and privileges in all respects, so that the 
same shall not be subject to be altered, limited, annulled, or restrained, 
except by judicial process, according to the principles of law; and in 
all grants hereafter to be made, by either State, of unloeated land 
within the said district, the same reservations shall be made for the 
benefit of schools and of the ministry as have heretofore been usual in 
grants made by this Commonwealth. And all lands heretofore granted 
by this Commonwealth to any religious, literary, or eleemosynary cor- 
poration or society shall be free from taxation while the same continues

which, if accepted by this convention in behalf of the people as aforesaid, are to be 
obligatory on the United States, viz: 
“1st. That section numbered sixteen in every township (when such section has

appropriated by the general assembly of this State for the use of common schools, 
and all such as shall hereafter be appropriated, shall remain a perpetual fund, the 
principal of which shall never be diminished by legislative appropriation, and the 
interest thereof shall be inviolably appropriated to the support and encouragement 
of common schools throughout the State, and for the equal benefit of all the people 
thereof; and no law shall be made authorizing said fund, or any part thereof, to

and it shall be the duty of the general assembly to appoint a board of commis- 
sioners, for such term of time as they may think proper, who shall have the general 
superintendence of said fund, and who ‘shall make a report of the condition of the 
same, from time to time, under such rules, regulations, and restrictions as may be 
required by law: Provided, That if at any time hereafter a division of the public 
lands of the United States, or any of the money arising from the sale of such lands,

The amended constitution of 1870 contains in Article XI, section 12, 
the same general declaration and provisions as formerly existed, down 
to and including the pledge that ‘‘no law shall be made authorizing 
said fund, or any part thereof, to be diverted to any other use than the 
support and encouragement of common schools.” In place of the suc- 
ceeding portions the following is substituted: 
The State taxes derived hereafter from polls shall be appropriated to educational 
purposes, in such manner as the general assembly shall, from time to time, direct by 
law. No school established or aided under this section shall allow white and negro 
children to be received as scholars together in the same school. The above pro- 
vision shall not prevent the legislature from carrying into effect any laws that haye 
been passed in favor of the colleges, universities, or academies, or from authorizing 
heirs or distributees to receive and enjoy escheated property under such laws as 
may be passed from time to time.

In this period we find education much more fully dealt with in the 
State constitutions than in the previous ones. The provisions following 
make this fully apparent. Butit is important to state the main causes 
that produced the expansion, and consequently we are required to take 
the year 1835 as the beginning of a new period. 
The democratic theory of government, as expounded by Mr. Jeffer- 
son, now reached its culmination. Heretofore the constitutions had
-P-A-G-E-107
  AMERICAN EDUCATIONAL HISTORY. : 1325 
been drawn in general terms; legislation, left to the legislature, had 
been carefully excluded from them; large powers had been intrusted 
to the constituted authorities, and some of the distrust of the people 
that marked the old English régime in America had been manifested. 
Time had revealed unexpected defects in the working of the State goy- 
ernments. Faith in legislators, governors, and judges tended to a 
minimum; faith in the sovereign péople to a maximum. The elective 
franchise was widely extended, and the number of elective officers 
greatly increased, while governmental powers were materially limited. 
Moreover, American life was rapidly growing in complexity andin com- 
pass, which brought new interests and new questions within the range 
of State recognition, and gave new. importance to old interests and 
questions. Asaresult, the States began to define in their constitutions 
governmental powers and functions with more fullness. and particu- 
larity. Legislation, or what would have been regarded as such at an 
earlier day, began to find its way into the fundamental laws of the 
States. Constitutions became more expanded and more bulky. Com- 
pare,.for example, the constitutions of New York framed in 1778 and 
1821 with that framed in 1846. 
But it is more to our purpose to observe that about 1835 the country — 
began to show a remarkable growth of interest in schools and educa- 
tion, which has been appropriately called “the American educational 
renaissance.” The decade 1835-1845 saw the first normal school 
founded, the first State board of education created, the first State sec- 
retary or superintendent appointed, the first teachers’ institute held, 
the first school libraries founded, and contact with the schools of 
Germany first practically established. Educational journalism also 
expanded, and attained to new power and usefulness. The State schools 
grew rapidly in number, in character, and in influence, while the State 
school funds, arising from the Congressional land grants, assumed a 
new value and importance. Also the State universities of the West, 
which now began to exercise an appreciable influence, called for State 
regulation. 
It was in this period, too, that the State schools were first antago- 
nized by ecclesiastical bodies. This antagonism was due to a variety of 
causes. The growth and increasing excellence of the State schools drew 
away pupils from church and private schools. Again, as these schools 
grew in power they were less subject to ecclesiastical direction, becom- 
ing mere civil or secular institutions. Then the rapidly increasing 
school funds and revenues from which the State schools derived their 
strength became an object of envy and desire to the managers of com- 
peting schools, while certain ecclesiastical influences became more pro- 
nounced in State affairs. Such causes as these compelled the safe- 
guarding of school funds.and revenues against misappropriation and. 
division.
-P-A-G-E-108
  1326 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Still another factor must be mentioned. As already hinted, the States: 
generally had in their early constitutions limited the suffrage to the 
more substantial classesof society. Very naturally its practical exten- 
sion to all male citizens 21 years of age and upward led to the lewer- 
ing of the total electorate in intelligence and character, especially in 
view of the growing aggregations of ignorance and viee in cities, and 
brought up the question whether the ballot-box should not be safe- 
guarded by an educational barrier. 
The student of the educational provisions which follow will readily 
discover the operation of everyone of the causes now enumerated. And 
still it is noteworthy that several of the States framing new constitu- 
tions in the years 1835-1861, or amending old ones, did not yield to the 
new influence, but adhered to the earlier practice.

ARTICLE IX.—Education and schools. 
FIRST EDUCATION. 
Src, 1. The educational interest of the State, to inelude common schools and 
other educational institutions, shall be under the management of a board of educa-

1 The school fund of the State of New York was created by an act passed April 5, 1805, which gave 
the net proceeds of 500,000 acres of vacant lands, to be sold by the surveyor-general (Simeon De Witt), 
and invested as a permanent fund. It was to be loaned to persons or bodies corporate for literary 
purposes, safely secured, until the income reached $50,000 annually, when the income was to be 
annually applied to school purposes. It reached this point in 1813, and from this date the school 
system of New York has a continuous history. No distribution was actually made until 1815. By 
subsequent donations from various sources the school fund had been increased to $1,155,827.40 on the 
day when the constitution of 1821 went into full effect, and there were, besides this, 991,660 acres of 
unsold lands then belonging to it. In many of the early sales of lands under State authority, and in 
the lands in central New York given as bounties to officers and soldiers of the Revolution, there was 
a reservation of amilesquare in each township for gospel and schools, and a like amount for literature. 
There were also large donations of land, or of the proceeds of land sales, to colleges, libraries, and 
other literary objects. The annual report of the superintendent of public instruction gives the 
amount of capital and mode of investment of the eommon-school fund for each year from the begin- 
ning. Its amount at intervals of ten years was as follows:

- 3,029, 165. 55        
  Its investment in 1874 was $50,000 in bank stock, $1,165,057.24 in State stocks, $36,000 in comp- 
troller's bonds, and $1,310,866.28 money in the treasury. —H. 
2The literature fund originated with the granting of certain lands for literary purposes, and was 
largely increased by four lotteries granted in 180), by which the sum of $100,000 was raised for the 
joint benefit of academies and common schools, but chiefly by the proceeds of sales of lands, arrears 
of quit-rents, profits on the sale of State stocks, and other appropriations which have been added 
from time to time. The capital of the literature fund on the 30th of September, 1874, was $271,989.76, 
and the revenue $50,157.13. ‘The investment was chiefly in State stocks ($242,347), and itis managed 
by the comptroller. ‘The expenditure is under the direction of the regents of the university.-H. 
®The United States deposit fund is a part of the sum of $37,468,859.97 distributed among the States 
Tune 23, 1836, of which $5,352,694.38 came to the State of New York. It was distributed among the 
counties on the basis of population and loaned on securities of real estate. Of its income the sum 
of $25,000 is added annually to the capital of the school fund, and the remainder applied to the 
schools and academies of th State, under the direction of the superintendent of prblic instruction 
and the regents of tho university. At the close of the fiscal year, September 30, 1874, the capital of 
this fund amounted to $4,014,529.71, and the revenue for the preceding year was $254,148.05.—H.

the five hundred thousand acres of land granted to the new States, under an act of 
Congress, distributing the proceeds of the public lands among the several States of 
the Union, approved in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty- 
one, and all estates of deceased persons who may have died without leaving a will or 
heir, and also such per cent. as may have been granted by Congress, on the sale of 
Jands in this State, shall be and remain a perpetual fund, the interest of which, 
together with all rents of the unsold lands, and such other means as the general 
assembly may provide, shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common

ratified in 1857 are the same as the foregoing, except that the verbiage

In this period most of the old forces continue to operate, some of 
them with increased energy. New ones also appear. 
No other cause that ever operated in the field of our inquiry was so 
directly potent as the civil war. The North believed that the lack of 
public schools at the South lay near the root of the war, and this belief 
had much to do with the development of Northern school systems and 
the expansion of statute books. That nothing must henceforth be left 
to the possible hostility or indifference of legislatures was the popular 
feeling. At the South the effect was far more striking. The one 
insuperable obstacle to the founding of efficient school systems by the 
Southern States was now removed. Moreover, the enfranchisement of . 
the blacks called loudly for their education. Nothing more strongly 
reveals Southern appreciation of the change that the war accomplished. 
than the promptness with which those States have established schools 
and placed them under the shields of their constitutions. Some of 
them even recognized education in the constitutions that they formed 
in the confusion of 1865, when they were expecting their Senators and 
Representatives to be admitted to Congress in accordance with Presi- — 
dent Johnson’s reconstruction proclamations. 
The Franco-Prussian war of 1870, which proved, as was commonly 
thought, the superiority of the educated man for all purposes whatso- 
ever, was a potent factor in American education. At the time tables 
showing the relative numbers of illiterate soldiers in the two armies 
were widely published, and Renan’s remark, ‘The universities con- 
quered at Sedan,” was widely quoted. 
The movement to enfranchise women has also made its contribution 
to the volume of constitutional provisions—witness those in relation to 
women voting on school questions and holding school offices. 
Socialistic opinion, combined no doubt with distrust of publishing 
interests, has committed California to a scheme of State school book
-P-A-G-E-124
    1342 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
publication. And the same opinion, or something akin to it, has caused 
that State to discriminate against high schools in the distribution of 
the State funds. 
Finally, the extraordinary expansion of the field of education in 
recent years has led to a similar expansion in constitutional educa- 
tion. Mention may be made of the new interest in manual and indus- 
trial training, and particularly of mining engineering in some of the 
States of the Pacifie Slope. 
Such are the main causes that, reinforced by those previously enu- 
merated, have caused so many of the States, commonly Western and 
Southern States, to insert in their constitutions educational articles 
as extended as the school laws of the New England States a century 
ago. Whole educationalsystems are found inoutline, State and county 
boards of education, State and county superintendence of schools, 
primary schools, grammar schools, high schools, normal schools, uni- 
versities, and agricultural colleges, the management of school taxes, 
aud the minimum length of the school year, are all provided for. In 
several instances two full pages of Poore’s Charters and Constitutions 
are occupied in this way. New England, the old Middle States, Ohio, 
lilinois, and some other States have not fallen into this current. But 
even the constitutional conventions that have refrained from legislation 
in relation to schools, have often uttered a firmer voice than before. 
Indefiniteness makes room for clearness; permission gives way to com- 
mand. 
  CONSTITUTION oF Kansas, JANUARY 29, 1861. 
ORDINANCE. 
Whereas the Government of the United States is the proprietor of a large portion 
of the lands included in the limits of the State of Kansas as defined by this consti- 
tution; and whereas the State of Kansas will possess the right to tax said lands for 
purposes of government, and other purposes: Now, therefore, be it ordained by the 
people of Kansas that the right of the State of Kansas to tax such lands is relinquished 
forever, and the State of Kansas will not interfere with the title of the United States 
to such lands, nor with any regulation of Congress in relation thereto, nor tax non- 
residents higher than residents: Provided always, That the following condition be 
agreed to by Congress: 
Src.1. Sections numbered 16 and 36 in each township in the State, including Indian 
reservations and trust-lands, shall be granted to the State for the exclusive use of 
common schools; and when either of said sections, or any part thereof, has been dis-

schools, school-houses, and school-fund of the district, as may be deemed necessary 
and proper. It shall be the duty of the superintendent of public instruction to rec- 
ommend to the legislature such provisions of law as may be found necessary, in the

months of each and every year: Provided, That when any of the scholastic inhabit- 
ants may be shown to have received regular instruction for said period of time in 
each and every year, from any private teacher having a proper certificate of compe- 
tency, this shall exempt them from the operation of the laws contemplated by this 
section. 
Suc. 6. As a basis for the establishment and endowment of said public¢ free schools, 
all the funds, lands, and other property heretofore set apart and appropriated, or 
that may hereafter be set apart and appropriated, for the support and maintenance

tion of Texas shall never be so amended as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United

inhabitants of this State; and no law shall ever be made appropriating such fund 
for any other use or purpose whatever. 
Src. 7. The legislature shall, if necessary, in addition to the income derived from 
the public-school-fund and from the taxes for school-purposes provided for in the 
foregoing section, provide for the raising of such amount by taxation, in the several 
school-districts in the State, as will be necessary to provide the necessary school- 
heuses in each district, and insure the education of all the scholastic inhabitants of 
the several districts. 
Src. 8. The public lands heretofore given to counties shall be under the control 
of the legislature, and may be sold under such regulations as the legislature may 
prescribe; and in such case the proceeds of the same shall be added to the public- 
school fund. i 
Sec. 9. The legislature shall, at its first session, (and from time to time thereafter, 
as may be found necessary,) provide all needful rules and regulations for the pur- 
pose of carrying into effect the provisions of this article. It is made the impera- 
tive duty of the legislature to see to it that all the children in the State, within the 
scholastic age, are, without delay provided with ample means of education. The 
legislature shall annually appropriate for school-purposes, and to be equally dis- 
tributed among all the scholastic population of the State, the interest accruing on

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TEN. 
To the National Council of Education: 
The committee of ten appointed at the meeting of the National Educational Asso- 
ciation at Saratoga on the 9th of July, 1892, have the honor to present the following 
report: 
At the meeting of the National Council of Education in 1891 a committee appointed 
at a previous meeting made a valuable report through their chairman, Mr. James H. 
Baker, then principal of the Denver high school, on the general subject of uniformity 
in school programmes and in requirements for admission to college. The committee 
was continued, and was authorized to procure a conference on the subject of uni- 
formity during the meeting of the National Council in 1892, the conference to consist 
of representatives of leading colleges and secondary schools in different parts of the 
country. This conference was duly summoned, and held meetings at Saratoga on 
July 7, 8, and 9, 1892. There were present between twenty and thirty delegates. 
Their discussions took a wide range, but resulted in the following specific recom- 
mendations, which the conference sent to the National Council of Education then in 
session: 
(1) That it is expedient to hold a conference of school and college teachers of each 
principal subject which enters into the programmes of secondary schools in the 
United States and into the requirements for admission to college—as for example, of 
Latin, of geometry, or of American history—each conference to consider the proper 
limits of its subject, the best methods of instruction, the most desirable allotment of 
time for the subject, and the best methods for testing the pupils’ attainments therein, 
and each conference to represent fairly the different parts of the country. 
(2) That a committee be appointed with authority to select the members of these 
conferences and to arrange their meetings, the results of all the conferences to be 
reported to this committee for such action as it may deem appropriate, and to form 
the basis of a report to be presented to the council by this committee.

(3) That this committee consist of the following gentlemen: 
Charles W. Eliot, president of Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. chair- 
man. ; 
William T. Harris, Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C. 
James B. Angell, president of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich. 
Joln Tetlow, head master of the girls’ high school and the girls’ Latin school, 
Boston, Mass. 
James M. Taylor, president of Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, N. Y. 
Oscar D. Robinson, principal of the high school, Albany, N. Y. 
James H. Baker, president of the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colo. 
Richard H. Jesse, president of the University of Missouri, Columbia, Mo. 
James C. Mackenzie, head master of the Lawrenceyille school, Lawrenceville, 
N. J. 
Henry C. King, professor in Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio. 
These recommendations of the conference were adopted by the National Council of 
Education on the 9th of July, and the council communicated the recommendations 
to the directors of the National Educational Association, with the further recom- 
mendation that an appropriation not exceeding $2,500 be made by the association 
toward the expenses of these conferences. On the 12th of July the directors adopted 
a series of resolutions under which a sum not exceeding $2,500 was made available 
for this undertaking during the academic year 1892-93. 
Every gentleman named on the above committee of ten accepted his appointment; 
and the committee met, with every member present, at Columbia College, New York 
City, from the 9th to the 11th of November, 1892, inclusive. 
In preparation for this meeting a table had been prepared by means of a pro- 
longed correspondence with the principals of selected secondary schools in various 
parts of the country, which showed the subjects taught in 40 leading secondary 
schools in the United States, and the total number of recitations, or exercises, allotted 
to each subject. Nearly 200 schools were applied to for this information; but it did 
not prove practicable to obtain within three months verified statements from more 
than 40 schools. This table proved conclusively, first, that the total number of sub- 
jects tanght in these secondary schools was nearly 40, 13 of which, however, were 
found in only a few schools; secondly, that many of these subjects were taught for 
such short periods that little training could be derived from them; and thirdly, that 
the time allotted to the same subject in the different schools varied widely. Even 
for the older subjects, like Latin and algebra, there appeared to be a wide diversity 
of practice with regard to the time allotted to them. Since this table was compara- 
tive in its nature—that is, permitted comparisons to be made between different 
schools—and could be easily misunderstood and misapplied by persons who had 
small acquaintance with school programmes, it was treated as a confidential docu- 
ment; and was issued at first only to members of the committee of ten and the 
principals of the schools mentioned in the table. Later, it was sent—still as a con- 
fidential paper—to the members of the several conferences organized by the com- 
mittee of ten. 
The committee of ton, after a preliminary discussion on November 9, decided on 
November 10 to organize conferences on the following subjects: (1) Latin; (2) Greek; 
(8) English; (4) other modern languages; (5) mathematics; (6) physics, astronomy, 
and chemistry; (7) natural history (biology, including botany, zoology, and physi- 
ology); (8) history, civil government, and political economy; (9) geography (phys- 
ical geography, geology, and meteorology). They also decided that each conference 
should consist of ten members. They then proceeded to select the members of each 
of these conferences, having regard in the selection to the scholarship and experi- 
ence of the gentlemen named, to the fair division of the members between colleges 
on the one hand and schools on the other, and to the proper geographical distribu- 
tion of the total membership. After selecting 90 members for the nine conferences, 
the committee decided on an additional number of names to be used as substitutes  
-P-A-G-E-199
    SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES, 1417 
for persons originally chosen who should decline to serve, from two to four substi- 
tutes being selected for each conference. In the selection of substitutes the commit- 
tee found it difficult to regard the geographical distribution of the persons selected 
with as much strictness as in the original selection; and, accordingly, when it 
became necessary to call on a considerable number of substitutes, the accurate geo- 
graphical distribution of membership was somewhat impaired. The lists of the 
members of the several éonferences were finally adopted at a meeting of the com- 
mitteo on November 11; and the chairman and secretary of a committee were 
then empowered to fill any vacancies which might occur. 
The committee next adopted the following list of questions as a guide for the dis- 
cussions of all the conferences, and directed that the conferences be called together 
on the 28th of December: 
“(1) In the school course of study extending approximately from the age of 6 to 18 
years—a course including the periods of both elementary and secondary instruction— 
at what age should the study which is the subject of the conference be first intro- 
duced? 
“(2) After it is introduced, how many hours a week for how many years should 
be devoted to it? 
**(3) How many hours a week for how many years should be devoted to it during 
the last four years of the complete course; that is, during the ordinary high school 
period? : 
“(4) What topics, or parts, of the subject may reasonably be covered during the 
whole course? 
“(5) What topics, or parts, of the subject may best be reserved for the last four 
years? 
“(6) In what form and to what extent should the subject enter into college require- 
ments for admission? Such questions as the sufficiency of translation at sight as a 
test of knowledge of a language, or the superiority of a laboratory examination in a 
scientific subject to a written examination on a text-book, are intended to be sug- 
gested under this head by the phrase ‘in what form.’ 
“(7) Should the subject be treated differently for pupils who are going to col- 
lege, for those who are going to a scientific school, and for those who, presumably, 
are going to neither? 
“(8) At what stage should this differentiation begin, if any be recommended? 
“(9) Can any description be given of the best method of teaching this subject 
throughout the school course? 
(10) Can any description be given of the best mode of testing attainments in this 
subject at collego admission examinations? 
“(11) For those cases in which colleges and universities permit a division of the 
admission examination into a preliminary and a final examination, separated by at 
least a year, can the best limit between the preliminary and final examinations be 
approximately defined?” 
The committee further voted that it was expedient that the conferences on Latin 
and Greek meet at the same place. Finally, all further questions of detail with 
regard to the calling and the instruction of the conferences were referred to the 
chairman with full power. 
During the ensuing six weeks, the composition of the nine conferences was deter- 
mined in accordance with the measures adopted by the committee of ten. Seventy 
persons originally selected by the committee accepted the invitation of the commit- 
tee, and 69 of these persons were present at the meetings of their respective confer- 
ences on the 28th of December. Twenty substitutes accepted service, of whom 12 
were persons selected by the committee of ten, and 8 were selected under the author- 
ity granted to the chairman and secretary of the committee in emergencies. One of 
these 8 gentlemen was selected by a conference at its first meeting. Two gentlemen 
who accepted service—one of the original members and one substitute—absented 
themselves from the meetings of their respective conferences without giving any
-P-A-G-E-200
  1418 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
notice to the chairman of the committee of ten, who was therefore unable to fill their 
places. With these two exceptions, all the conferences met on December 28 with 
full membership. 
The places of meeting were as follows: For the Latin and Greek conferences, the 
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Mich.; for the English conference, Vassar Col- 
lege, Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; for the conference on other modern languages, the Bureau 
of Education, Washington, D. C.; for the conference on mathematics, Harvard Uni- 
versity, Cambridge, Mass.; for the conference en physics, astronomy, and chemistry, 
and on natural history, the University of Chicago, Chicago, Ill.; for the eonference 
on history, civil government, and political economy, the University of Wisconsin, 
Madison, Wis.; for the conference on geography, the Cook County normal school, 
Englewood, Ill. The committee of ten and all the conferences enjoyed the hospital- 
ity of the several institutions at which they met, and the members were made wel- 
come at private houses during the sessions. Through the exertions of Mr. N. A. 
Calkins, chairman of the trustees of the National Educational Association, important 
reductions of railroad fares were procured for some members of the committee and of 
the conferences; but the reductions obtainable were less numerous and considerable 
than the National Council of Education had hoped. In filling a few vacancies of 
which notice was received shortly before December 28, it was necessary to regard as 
one qualification nearness of residence to the appointed places of meeting; but on 
the whole the weight and effectiveness of the several conferences were not impaired 
by the necessary replacement of 20 of the members originally selected by the com- 
mittee of ten. The list of the members of the conferences on the 28th of December

The 90 members of the conferences were divided as follows: Forty-seven were in 
the service of colleges or universitics, 42 in the service of schools, and 1 was a 
Government official formerly in the service of a university. A considerable number 
of the college men, however, had also had experience in schools, Each conference, 
in accordance with a recommendation of the committee of ten, chose its own chair- 
man and secretary; and these two officers prepared the report of each conference. 
Six of the chairmen were college men and 3 were school men, while of the secre- 
taries 2 were college men and 7 school men, The committee of ten requested that 
the reports of the conferences should be sent to their chairman by the 1st of April, 
1893—three months being thus allowed for the preparation of the reports. Seven 
conferences substantially conformed to this request of the committee; but the 
reports from the conferences on natural history and geography were delayed until 
the second week in July. The committee of ten, being of course unable to prepare 
their own report until all the reports of the December conferences had been received, 
were prevented from presenting their report, as they had intended, at the education 
congress which met at Chicago July 27-29. 
All the conferences sat for three days. Their discussions were frank, earnest, and 
thorough; but in every conference an extraordinary unity of opinion was arrived at. 
The nine reports are characterized by an amount of agreement which quite surpasses 
the most sanguine anticipations. Only two conferences present minor.ty reports, 
namely, the conference on physics, astronomy, and chemistry, and the conference on 
geography; and in the first case the dissenting opinions touch only two pints in 
the report of the majority, one of which is unimportant. In the great majority of 
matters brought before each conference the decision of the conference was unani- 
mous. When one considers the different localities, institutions, professional experi- 
ences, and personalities represented in each of the conferences, the unanimity 
developed is very striking, and should carry great weight. 
Before the 1st of October, 1893, the reports of the conferences had all been printed, 
after revision in proof by the chairmen of the conferences, respectively, and had been 
distributed to the members of the committee of ten, together with a preliminary 
draft of a report for the committee. With the aid of comments and suggestions 
received from members of the committee a second draft of this report was made 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. _ 1421 
  ready in print to serve as the groundwork of the deliberations of the committee at 
their final meeting. This meeting was held at Columbia College from the 8th to the 
11th of November, 1893, inclusive, every member being present except Professor King, 
who is spending the current academic year in Europe. The points of view and the 
fields of work of the different members of the committee being fortunately various, 
the discussions at this prolonged meeting were vigorous and comprehensive, and 
resulted in a thorough revision of the preliminary report. This third revise having 
been submitted to the members of the committee, a cordial agreement on both the 
form and the substance of the present report, with the exceptions stated in the 
minority report of President Baker, was arrived at after a correspondence which 
extended over three weeks. The report itself embodies the numerous votes and reso- 
lutions adopted by the committee. 
Professor King, having received in Europe the conference reports, the two prelim. 
inary drafts of the committee’s report, and the third revise, desired to have his 
name signed to the final report. 
The council and the public will doubtless be impressed, at first sight, with the 
great number and variety of important changes urged by the conferences; but on a 
careful reading of the appended reports it will appear that the spirit of the confer- 
ences was distinctly conservative and moderate, although many of their recommen- 
dations are of a radical nature. The conferences which found their tasks the most 
difficult were the conferences on physics, astronomy, and chemistry; natural his- 
tory; history, civil government, and political economy; and geography; and these 
four conferences make the longest and most elaborate reports, for the reason that 
these subjects are to-day more imperfectly dealt with in primary and secondary 
schools than are the subjects of the first five conferences. ‘The experts who met to 
confer together concerning the teaching of the last four subjects in the list of con- 
ferences all felt the need of setting forth in an ample way what ought to be taught, 
in what order, and by what method. They ardently desired to have their respec- 
tive subjects made equal to Latin, Greek, and mathematics in weight and influence 
in the schools; but they knew that educational tradition was adverse to this desire, 
and that many teachers and directors of education felt no confidence in these sub- 
jects as disciplinary material. Hence the length and elaboration of these reports. 
In less degree, the conferences on English and other modern languages felt the same 
difficultics, these subjects being relatively new as substantial elements in school 
programmes, 
The committee of ten requested the conferences to make their reports and recom- 
mendations as specific as possible. This request was generally complied with; but, 
very naturally, the reports and recommendations are more specific concerning the 
selection of topics in each subject, the best methods of instruction, and the desir- 
able appliances or apparatus, than concerning the allotment of time to each subject. 
The allotment of time is a very important matter of administrative detail; but it 
presents great difficulties, requires a comprehensive survey of the comparative 
claims of many subjects, and in different parts of the country is necessarily affected 
by the various local conditions and historical developments. ‘Nevertheless, there 
will be found in the conference reports recommendations of a fundamental and far- 
reaching character concerning the allotment of programme time to each subject. 
Tt might have been expected that every conference would have demanded for its 
subject a larger proportion of time than is now commonly assigned to it in primary 
and secondary schools; but, as » matter of fact, the reports are noteworthy for their 
moderation in this respect, especially the reports on the old and well-established 
subjects. The Latin conference declares that “in view of the just demand for 
more and better work in several other swhjects of the preparatory course, it seemed 
clear to the conference that no increase in the quantity of the preparation in Latin 
should be asked for.” Among the votes passed by the Greek conference will be 
noticed the following: ‘‘That in making the following recommendations this con- 
ference desires that the average age at which pupils now enter college should be 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
1422 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  lowered rather than raised; and the conference urges that no addition be made in 
the advanced requirements in Greek for admission to college.” The mathematical 
conference recommends that the course in arithmetic in elementary schools should 
be abridged, and recommends only a moderate assignment of time to algebra and 
geometry. The conference on geography says of the present assignment of time to 
geography in primary and secondary schools that “it is the judgment of the con- 
ference that too much time is given to the subject in proportion to the results 
secured. Itis not their judgment that more time is given to the subject than it 
merits, but that either more should be accomplished or less time taken to attain ib.” 
Anyone who reads these nine reports conseeutively will be struck with the fact 
that all these bodies of experts desire to have the elements of their several subjects 
taught earlier than they now are, and that the conferences on all the subjects except 
the languages desire to have given in the elementary schools what may be called 
perspective views, or broad surveys, of their respective subjects—expecting that in 
later years of the school.course parts of these same subjects will be taken up with 
more amplitude and detail. Tho conferences on Latin, Greek, and the modern lan- 
guages agree in desiring to have the study of foreign languages begin at a much 
earlier age than now—the Latin conference suggesting by a reference to European 
usage that Latin be begun from threo to five years earlier than it commonly is now. 
The conference on mathematics wish to have given in elementary schools not only a 
general survey of arithmetic, but also the elements of algebra, and concrete geometry 
in connection with drawing. The conference on physics, chemistry, and astronomy 
urge that nature studies should constitute an important part of the elementary 
school course from the very beginning. The conference on natural history wish the 
elements of botany and zoology to be taught in the primary schools. The conference 
on history wish the systematic study of history to begin as early as the tenth year 
of age, and the first two years of study to be devoted to mythology and to biography 
for the illustration of general history as well as of American history. Finally, the 
conference on geography recommend that the earlier course treat broadly of the 
earth, its environment and inhabitants, extending freely into fields which in later 
years of study are recognized as belonging to separate sciences. 
In thus claiming entrance for their subjects into the earlier years of school attend- 
ance, the éonferences on the newer subjects are only seeking an advantage which 
the oldest subjects have long possessed. The elements of language, number, and 
geography have long been imparted to young children, As things now are, the 
high school teacher finds in the pupils fresh from the grammar schools no founda- 
tion of elementary mathematical conceptions outside of arithmetic; no acquaint- 
ance with algebraic language, and no accurate knowledge ef geometrical forms. 
As to botany, zoology, chemistry, and physics, the minds of pupils entering the 
high school are ordinarily blank. When college professors endeavor to teach chem- 
istry, physics, botany, zoology, meteorology, or geology to persons of 18 or 20 years 
of age, they discover that in most instances new habits of observing, reflecting, and 
recording have to be painfully acquired by the students—habits which they should 
have acquired in early childhood. The college teacher of history finds in like man- 
ner that his subject has never taken any serious hold on the minds of pupils fresh 
from the secondary schools. He finds that they have devoted astonishingly little 
time to the subject, and that they have acquired no habit of historical investigation, 
or of the comparative examination of different historical narratives concerning the 
‘same periods or events. It is inevitable, therefore, that specialists in any one of the 
subjects which are pursued in the high schools or colleges should earnestly desire 
(that the minds of young children be stored with some of the elementary facts and 
principles of their subject, and that all the mental habits, which the adult student 
will surely need, begin to be formed in the child’s mind before the age of 14. It 
follows, as a matter of course, that all the conferences except the conference on 
Greek, make strong suggestions concerning the programmes of primary and gram- 
mar schools—generally with some reference to the subsequent programmes of sec-
-P-A-G-E-205

ondary sehools. They desire important changes in the elementary grades, and the 
changes recommended are all in the direction of increasing simultaneously the inter- 
est and the substantial training quality of primary and grammar school studies. 
If anyone feels dismayed at the number and variety of the subjects to be opened 
to children of tender age, let him observe that while these nine conferences desire 
each their own subject to be brought into the courses of elementary schools, they 
all agree that these different subjects should be correlated and associated one with 
another by the programme and by the actual teaching. If the nine conferences had 
sat all together as a single body, instead of sitting as detached and even isolated 
bodies, they could not have more forcibly expressed their conviction that every sub- 
ject recommended for introduction into elementary and secondary schools should 
help every other; and that the teacher of each single subject should feel responsible 
for the advancement of the pupils in all subjects, and should distinctly contribute 
to this advancement. 
On one very important question of general poliey, which affects profoundly the 
preparation of all school programmes, the committee of ten and all the conferences 
are absolutely unanimous. Among the questions suggested for discussion in each 
eonference were the following: 
“(7) Should the subject be treated differently for pupils who are going to college, 
for those who are going to a scientifie school, and for those who, presumably, are 
going to neither? 
(8) At what age should this differentiation begin, if any bo recommended?” 
The seventh question is answered unanimously in the negative by the conferences, 
and the eighth therefore needs no answer. The committee of ten unanimously agree 
with the conferences. Ninety-eight teachers, intimately concerned either with the 
actual work of, American secondary schools, or with the results of that work as 
they appear in students who come to college, unanimously declare that every sub- 
ject which is taught at all in a secondary school should be taught in the same way 
and to the same extent to every pupil so long as he pursues it, no matter what the 
probable destination of the pupil may be, or at what point his education is to cease. 
Thus, for all pupils who study Latin, or history, or algebra, for example, the allot- 
ment of time and the method of instruction in a given school should be the same 
year by year. Not that all the pupils should pursue every subject for the same num- 
ber of years; but so long as they do pursue it, they should all be treated alike. It 
has been a very general eustom in American high schools and academies to make up 
Separate courses of study for pupils of supposed different destinations, the propor- 
tions of the several studies in the different courses being various. The: principle 
Taid down by the conferences will, if logically carried out, make a great sinrplifica- 
tion in secondary school programmes. It will lead to each subject's being treated 
by the school in the same way by the year for all pupils, and this, whether the indi- 
vidual pupil be required to choose between courses which run through several years, 
or be allowed some choice among subjects year by year. 
Persons who read all the appended reports will observe the frequent oceurrence of 
the statement: that, in order to introduce the changes recommended, teachers more 
highly trained will be needed in both the elementary and the secondary schools, 
There are frequent expressions to the effect that a higher grade of scholarship is 
needed in teachers of the lower classes, or that the general adoption of some method 
urged by a conference must depend upon the better preparation of teachers in the 
high schools, model schools, normal schools, or colleges in which they are trained. 
The experienced principal or superintendent in reading the reports will be apt to say 
to himself: ‘‘This recommendation is sound, but can not be carried out without 
teachers who have received a training superior to that of the teachers now at my 
eommand.” Itmust be remembered, in connection with these admissions, or expres- 
sions of anxiety, that the conferences were urged by the committee of ten to advise 
the committee concerning the best possible—almost the ideal—treatment of each 
subject taught in a secondary school course, without, however, losing sight of the

  1424 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
actual condition of American schools, or pushing their recommendations beyond 
what might reasonably be considered attainable in a moderate number of years. 
The committee believe that the conferences have carried out wisely the desire of the 
committee, in that they have recommended improvements which, though great and 
seldom to be made at once and simultaneously, are by no means unattainable. The 
existing agencies for giving instruction to teachers alrea‘ly in service are numerous; 
and the normal schools and the colleges are capable of making prompt and success- 
ful efforts to supply the better trained and equipped teachers for whom the reports 
of the conferences call. 
Many recommendations will be found to be made by more than one conference. 
Thus, all the conferences on foreign languages seem to agree that the introduction of 
two foreign languages in the same year is inexpedient; and all of them insist on 
practice in reading the foreign language aloud, on the use of good English in trans- 
lating, and on practico in translating the foreign language at sight, and in writing 
it. Again, all the conferences on scientific subjects dwell on laboratory work by the 
pupils as the best means of instruction, and on the great utility of the genuine labo- 
ratory notebook; and they all protest that teachers of science need at least as 
thorough a special training as teachers of languages or mathematics receive. In 
reading the reports, many instances will be noticed in which different conferences 
have reached similar conclusions without any consultation, or have followed a com- 
mon line of thought. 
Your committee now proceed to give summaries of the most important reeommen- 
dations made by the conferences as regards topics and methods, reserving the sub- 
ject of time allotment. But in so doing, they desire to say that the reading of these 
summaries should not absolve anyone interested in the general subject from read- 
ing with care the entire report of every conference. The several reports are so full 
of suggestions and recommendations concisely and cogently stated that it is impos- 
sible to present adequate abstracts of them. 
1, LATIN, 
An important recommendation of the Latin conference is the recommendation that 
the study of Latin be introduced into American schools earlier than it nowis. They 
recommend that translation at sight form a constant and increasing part of the 
examinations for admission to college and of the work of preparation. They next 
urge that practice in writing Latin should not be dissociated from practice in read- 
ing and translating; but, on the contrary, that the two should be carried on with 
equal steps. The conference desire the schools to adopt a greater variety of Latin 
authors for beginners, and they give good reasons against the exclusive use of 
Cwsar’s Gallic War. They object to the common practice of putting the teaching of 
beginners into the hands of the youngest teachers, who have the slenderest equip- 
ment of knowledge and experience. They dwell on the importance of attending to 
pronunciation and reading aloud, to forms, vocabulary, syntax, and order, and to 
the means of learning to understand the Latin before translating it; and they 
describe and urge the importance of a higher ideal in translation than now prevails 
in secondary schools. The formal recommendations of the conference, fourteen in 
number, will be found concisely stated in numbered paragraphs at the close of their 
report. 
2. GREEK. 
The conference on Greek agree with the conference on Latin in recommending the 
cultivation of reading at sight in schools, and in recommending that practice in 
translation into the foreign language should be continued throughout the school 
course, They urge that three years be the minimum time for the.study of Greek in 
schools; provided that Latin be studied four years. They would not have a pupil 
begin the study of Greek without a knowledge of the elements of Latin. They 
recommend the substitution of portions of the Hellenica for two books of the Anab-
-P-A-G-E-207
  SECONDARY SCHOOL “STUDIES. 1425 
asis in the requirements for admission to college, and the use of some narrative 
portions of Thucydides in schools. They urge that Homer should continue to be 
studied in all schools which provide instruction in Greek through three years, and 
they suggest that the Odyssey is to be preferred to the Iliad. They regret ‘‘that so 
few colleges through their admission examinations encourage reading at sight in 
schools.” Like the Latin conference, the Greek conference urge that the reading of 
the text be constantly practiced by both teacher and pupil, ‘‘and that teachers 
require from their pupils no less intelligent reading of the text than accurate trans- 
lation of the same.” The Greek conference also adopted a vote ‘‘to concur with the 
Latin conference as to the age at which the study of Latin should be begun.” The 
specific recommendations of the conference will be found in brief form in the para- 
graphs at the head of the eleven numbered sections into which their report is divided. 
3. ENGLISH. 
The conference on English found it necessary to deal with the study of English 
in schools below the high school grade as well as in the high school, Their opening 
recommendations deal with the very first years of school, and one of the most inter- 
esting and admirable parts of their report relates to English in the primary and the 
grammar schools, 
The conference are of the opinion that English should be pursued in the high 
school during the entire course of four years; but in making this recommendation 
the conference have in mind both study of literature and training in the expression 
of thought. To the study of rhetoric they assign one hour a week in the third year 
of the high school course. To the subject. of historical and systematic grammar they 
assign ono hour a week in the fourth year of the high school course, The intelligent 
reader of the report of this conference will find described in it the means by which 
the study of English in secondary schools is to be made the equal of any other study 
in disciplinary or developing power. The conference claim for English as much 
time as the Latin conference claim for Latin in secondary schools; and it is clear 
that they intend that the study shall be in all respects as serious and informing as 
the study of Latin. One of the most interesting opinions expressed by the confer- 
ence is ‘‘that the best results in the teaching of English in high schools can not be 
secured without the aid given by the study of some other language; and that Latin 
and German, by reason of their fuller inflectional system, are especially suited to this 
end.” In the case of high schools, as well as in schools of lower grade, the confer- 
ence declare that every teacher, whatever his department, should feel responsible 
for the use of good English on the part of his pupils. 
In several passages of this report the idea recurs that training in English must 
go hand in hand with the study of other subjects. Thus the conference hope for the 
study of the history and geography of the English-speaking people, so far as these 
illustrate the development of the English language. They mention that ‘the extent 
to which the study of the sources of English words can be carried in any school or 
class will depend on the acquaintance the pupils possess with Latin, French, and 
German.” They say that the study of words should be so pursued as to illustrate 
the political, social, intellectual, and religious development of the English race; 
and they urge that the admission of a student to college should be made to depend 
largely on his ability to write English, as shown in his examination books on other 
subjects. It is a fundamental idea in this report that the study of every other sub- 
ject should contribute to the pupil’s training in English, and that the pupil’s 
capacity to write English should be made available and be developed in every other 
department. The very specific recommendations of the conference as to English 
requirements for admission to colleges and scientific schools are especially wise and 
valuable. t 
4 OTHER MODERN LANGUAGES. 
The most novel and striking recommendation made by the conference on modern 
languages is that an elective course in German or French be provided in the gram- 
ED 93: 90°   
   
-P-A-G-E-208
  1426 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
mar school, the instruction to be open to children at about 10 years of age: The 
conference made this recommendation “in the firm belief that the edueational 
effects of modern language study will be of immense benefit to all who are able to 
pursue it under proper guidance.” They admit that the study of Latin presents 
the same advantages; but living languages seem to them better adapted to grammar 
school work, The recommendations of this conference with regard to the number 
of lessons a week are specific. They even construct a table showing the time which 
should be devoted to modern languages in each of the last four years of the elemen- 
tary schools and in each year of the high school. They plead that “all pupils of 
the same intelligence and the same degree of maturity be instructed alike, no 
matter whether they are subsequently to enter a college or scientific school, or 
intend to pursue their studies no further.” The conference also state with great 
precision what in their judgment may be expected of pupils in German and French 
at the various stages of their progress. An important passage of the report treats 
of the best way to facilitate the progress of beginners; pupils should be lifted over 
hard places; frequent reviews are not to be recommended; new texts stimulate 
interest and enlarge the vocabulary. Their recommendations concerning translation 
into English, reading aloud, habituating the ear to the sounds of the foreign lan- 
guage, and translating into the foreign language, closely resemble the recommen- 
dations of the conferences on Latin, Greek, and English regarding the best methods 
of instruction in those languages. In regard to college requirements, the conference 
agree with several other conferences in stating “that college requirements for 
admission should coincide with the high school requirements for graduation.” 
Finally, they declare that ‘the worst obstacle to modern language study is the lack 
of properly equipped instructors, and that it is the duty of universities, States, 
~ and cities to provide opportunities for the special preparation of modern language 
teachers.” 
: 5, MATHEMATICS. 
The form of the report of the conference on mathematics differs somewhat from 
that of the other reports. This report is subdivided uiider five headings: (1) General 
conclusions; (2) the teaching of arithmetic; (3) the teaching of concrete geometry; 
(4) the teaching of algebra; (5) the teaching of formal or demonstrative geometry. 
The first general conclusion of the conference was arrived at unanimously, The 
conference consisted of one Government official and university professor, five profes- 
sors of mathematics in as many colleges, one principal of a high school, two teachers 
of mathematics in endowed schools, and one proprietor of a private school for boys. 
The professional experience of these gentlemen and their several fields of work were 
various, and they came from widely separated parts of the country; yet they were 
unanimously of opinion “that a radical change in the teaching of arithmetic was 
necessary.” They recommend “that the course in arithmetic be at once abridged 
and enriched; abridged by omitting entirely those subjects which perplex and 
exhaust the pupil without affording any really valuable mental discipline, and 
enriched by a greater number of exercises in simple calculation, and in the solution 
of concrete problems.” They specify in detail the subjects which they think should 
be curtailed or entirely omitted, and they give in their special report on the teach- 
ing of arithmetic a full statement of the reasons on which their conclusion is based. 
They map out a course in arithmetic which, in their judgment, should begin about. 
the age of 6 years, and be completed at about the thirteenth year of age. 
The conference next recommend that a course of instruction in concrete geometry 
with numerous exercises be introduced into the grammar schools, and that this 
instruction should, during the earlier years, be given in connection with drawing. 
They recommend that the study of systematic algebra should be begun at the age 
of 14; but that, in connection with the study of arithmetic, the pupils should earlier 
be made familiar with algebraic expressions and symbols, including the method of 
solving simple equations. “The conference believe that the study of demonstrative 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
    
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1427 
geometry should begin at the end of the first year’s study of algebra, and be carried. 
on by the side of algebra for the next two years, occupying about two hours and a 
half a week.” They are also of opinion ‘that if the introductory course in concrete 
geometry has been well taught, both plane and solid geometry can be mastered at 
this time.” Most of the improvements in teaching arithmetic which the conference 
suggest ‘can be summed up under the two heads of giving the teacher a more con- 
crete form, and paying more attention to facility and correctness in work. The 
concrete system should not be confined to principles, but be extended to practical 
applications in measuring and in physics.” 
In regard to the teaching of concrete geometry, the conference urge that while 
the student’s geometrical education should begin in the kindergarten, or at the 
latest in the primary school, systematic instruction in concrete or experimental 
geometry should begin at about the age of 10 for the average student, and should 
occupy about one school hour a week for at least three years. From the outset of 
this course, the pupil should be required to express himself verbally as well as by 
drawing and modeling. He should learn to estimate by the eye, and to measure 
with some degree of accuracy lengths, angular magnitudes, and areas; to make 
accurate plans from his own measurements and estimates; and to make models of 
simple geometrical solids. The whole work in concrete geometry will connect itself 
on the one side with the work in arithmetic, and on the other with elementary 
instruction in physics. With the study of arithmetic is therefore to be intimately 
associated the study of algebraic signs and forms, of conerete geometry, and of 
elementary physics. Here is astriking instance of the interlacing of subjects which 
seems so desirable to every one of the nine conferences. 
Under the head of teaching algebra, the conference set forth in detail the method 
of familiarizing the pupil with the use of algebraic language during the study of 
arithmetic. This part of the report also deals clearly with the question of the time 
required for the thorough mastery of algebra through quadratic “equations. The 
report on the teaching of demonstrative geometry is a clear and concise statement of 
the best method of teaching this subject. It insists on the importance of elegance 
and finish in geometrical demonstration, for the reason that the discipline for which 
geometrical demonstration is to be chiefly prized is a discipline in complete, exact, 
and logical statement. If slovenliness of expression, or awkwardness of form is 
tolerated, this admirable discipline is lost. The conference therefore recommend an 
abundance of oral exercises in geometry—for which there is no proper substitute— 
and the rejection of all demonstrations which are not exact and formally perfect. 
Indeed throughout all the teaching of mathematics the conference deem it important 
that great stress be laid by the teacher on accuracy of statement and elegance of 
form as well as on clear and rigorous reasoning. Another very important recom- 
mendation in this part of the report is to be found in the following passage: ‘As 
soon as the student has acquired the art of rigorous demonstration, his work should 
cease to be merely receptive. He should begin to devise constructions and demon- 
strations for himself. Geometry can not be mastered by reading the demonstrations 
‘of a text-book, and while there is no branch of elementary mathematies in which 
purely receptive work, if continued too long, may lose its interest more completely, 
there is also none in which independent work can be made more attractive and stim- 
ulating.” These observations are entirely in accordance with the recent practice of 
some colleges in setting admission examination papers in geometry which demand of 
the candidates some capacity to solye new problems, or rather to make new applica- 
tion of familiar principles. 
6. PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, AND ASTRONOMY. 
The conference on this subject were urgent that the study of simple natural phe- 
nomena be introduced into elementary schools, and it was the sense of the confer- 
ence that atleast one period a day from the first year of the primary school should 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-210
~ 1428 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
be given to such study. Apparently the conference entertained the “opi ion that the 
present teachers in elementary schools are ill prepared to teach children how to 
observe simple natural phenomena; for their second recommendation was that special 
science teachers or superintendents be appointed to instruct the teachers of elemen- 
    tary schools in the methods of teaching natural phenomena. The conference was — 
clearly of opinion that from the beginning this study should be pursued by the pupil 
chiefly, though not exclusively, by means of experiments and by practice in the use 
of simple instruments for making physical measurements. The report dwells repeat- 
edly on the importance of the study of things and phenomena by direct contact. It 
  emphasizes the necessity of a large proportion of laboratory work in the study of 
physics and chemistry, and advocates the keeping of laboratory notebooks by the 
pupils, and the use of such notebooks as part of the test for admission to college. 
At the same time the report points out that laboratory work must be conjoined with 
the study of a text-book and with attendance at lectures or demonstrations, and 
that intelligent direction by a good teacher is as necessary in a laboratory as it is in 
the ordinary recitation or lecture room. 
The great utility of the laboratory notebook is emphatically stated. To the objec- 
tion that the kind of instruction described requires much time and effort on the part 
of the teacher, the conference reply that to give good instruction in the sciences 
requires of the teacher more work than to give good instruction in mathematics or 
the languages; and that the sooner this fact is recognized by those who have the 
management of schools the better for all concerned. The science teacher must reg- 
ularly spend much time in collecting materials, preparing experiments, and keeping 
collections in order, and this indispensable labor should be allowed for in pro- 
grammes and salaries. As regards the means of testing the progress of the pupils 
in physics and chemistry, the conference were unanimously of opinion that a lab- 
oratory examination should always be combined with an oral or written examina- 
tion, neither test taken singly being sufficient. There was a difference of opinion 
in the conference on the question whether physics should precede chemistry, or 
chemistry physics. The logical order would place physics first; but all the mem- 
bers of the conference but one advised that chemistry be put first for practical 
reasons which are stated in the majority report. A subcommittee of the conference 
has prepared lists of experiments in physics and chemistry for the use of secondary 
schools, not, of course, as a prescription, but only as a suggestion, and a somewhat 
precise indication of the topics which the conference had in mind, and of the limits 
of the instruction. 
7. NATURAL HISTORY. 
The conference on natural history unanimously agreed that the study of botany 
and zoology ought to be introduced into the primary schools at the very beginning 
of the school course, and be pursued steadily, with not less than two periods a week, 
throughout the whole course below the high school. In the next place they agreed 
that in these early lessons in natural science no text-book should be used; but that 
the study should constantly be associated with the study of literature, language, 
and drawing. It was their opinion that the study of physiology should be post 
poned to the later years of the high school course; but that in the high school, some 
branch of natural history proper should be pursued every day throughout at least 
one year. Like the report on physics, chemistry, and astronomy, the report on 
natural history emphasizes the absolute necessity of laboratory work by the pupils 
on plants and animals, and would have careful drawing insisted on from the begin- 
ning of the instruction. 
As the laboratory notebook is recommended by the conference on physics, so the 
conference on natural history recommends that the pupils should be made to express 
themselves clearly and exactly in words, or by drawings, in describing the object 
which they observe; and they believe that this practice will be found a valuable 
aid in training the pupils in the art of expression. They agree with the conference 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1429 
‘on physics, chemistry, and astronomy that science examinations should include both 
a written and a laboratory test, and that the laboratory notebooks of the pupils 
should be produced at the examination. The recommendations of this conference 
are therefore very similar to those of the sixth conference, so far as methods go; 
but there are appended to the general report of the conference on natural history 
subreports which describe the proper topics, the best order of topics, and the right 
methods of instruction in botany for schools below the high school, and for the high 
school itself, and in zoology for the secondary schools. Inasmuch as both the sub- 
ject-matter and the methods of instruction in natural history are much less familiar 
to ordinary school teachers than the matter and the methods in the languages and 
mathematics, the conference believed that descriptive details were necessary in 
order to give a clear view of the intentions of the conference. In another subreport 
the conference give their reasons for recommending the postponement to the latest 
possible time of the study of physiology and hygiene. Like the sixth conference, 
the conference on natural history protest that no person should be regarded as quali- 
fied to teach natural science who has not had special training for this work—a 
preparation at least as thorough as that of their feliow teachers of mathematics 
and the languages. 
8. HISTORY, CIVIL GOVERNMENT, AND POLITICAL ECONOMY. 
The conference on history, civil government, and political economy had a task 
different in some respects from those of other conferences. It is nowadays admitted 
that language, natural science, and mathematics should each make a substantial part 
of education; but the function of history in education is still very imperfectly appre- 
hended. Accordingly the eighth conference were at pains to declare their conception 
of the object of studying history and civil government in schools, and their belief in 
the efficiency of these studies in training the judgment, and in preparing children 
for intellectual enjoyments in after years, and for the exercise at maturity of a salu- 
tary influence upon national affairs. They believed that the time devoted in schools 
to history and the allied subjects should be materially increased, and they have there- 
fore presented arguments in favor of that increase. At the same time, they state 
strongly their conviction that they have recommended ‘‘ nothing that was not already 
being done in some good schools, and that might not reasonably be attained wher- 
ever there is an efficient system of graded schools.” This conference state quite as 
strongly as any other their desire to associate the study of their particular subject 
with that of other subjects which enter into every school programme. They declare 
that the teaching of history should be intimately connected with the teaching of 
English; that pupils should be encouraged to avail themselves of their knowledge 
of ‘ancient end modern languages; and that their study of history should be asso- 
ciated with the study of topography and political geography, and should be supple- 
mented by the study of historical and commercial geography, and the drawing of 
historical maps. They desire that historical works shouldbe used for reading in 
schools, and that subjects of English composition should be drawn from the lessons 
in history. They would have historical poems committed to memory, and the read- 
ing of biographies and historical novels encouraged. While they are of opinion 
that political economy should not be taught in secondary schools, they urge that in 
connection with United States history, civil government, and commercial geography, 
instruction should be given in the most important economic topics. The conference 
would therefore have the instruction in history made contributary to the work in 
three other school departments, namely, English, geography, and drawing. The sub- 
ject of civil government they would associate with both history and geography. 
They would introduce it into the grammar school by means of oral lessons, and 
into the high school by means of a text-book with collateral reading and oral les- 
sons. In the high school they believe that the study of civil government may be 
made comparative—that is, that the American method may be compared with foreign 
systems. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  1430 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Although the conference was made up of very diverse elements, every member of 
_ the conference was heartily in favor of every vote adopted. This remarkable 
\ unanimity was not obtained by the silence of dissentients, or the withdrawal of 
opposition on disputed points. It was the natural result of the strong conviction of 
all the members that history, when taught by the methods advocated in their report, 
deserves a position ‘in school programmes which would give it equal dignity and 
importance with any of the most favored subjects, and that the advantages for all 
children of the rational study of history ought to be diffused as widely as possible. 
On one point they made a clearer declaration than any other conference, although 
several other conferences indicate similar opinions. They declared that their interest 
was chiefly ‘‘in the school children who have no expectation of going to college, the 
larger number of whom will not even enter a high school,” and that their ‘‘recom- 
mendations are in no way directed to building up the colleges, or increasing the 
number of college students.” Like every other conference, they felt anxious about 
the qualifications of the teachers who are to be intrusted with the teaching of his- 
tory, and they urged that only teachers who have had adequate special training 
should be employed to teach history and civil government. In their specific recom- 
mendations they strongly urge that the historical course be made continuous from 
year to year, and extend through eight years, and in this respect be placed upon the 
same footing with other substantial subjects. 
The answers of this conference to the questions contained in the memorandum sent 
to the conferences by the committee of ten were specific and clear. They will be 
found in an appendix to the report of the conference. 
In regard to the time to be devoted to history in school programmes, this confer- 
ence ask for not less than three periods a week throughout a course of eight years; 
and they suggest that some of this time can be found by contracting the course in 
arithmetic and using for history a part of the time now given to political geography 
and to language study. Of these eight years they suggest that four should be in the 
high school and four in the grammar school. They “especially recommend such a 
choice of subjects as will give pupils in the grammar schools an opportunity of 
studying the history of other countries, and to the high schools one year’s study on 
the intensive method.” 
A large portion of the report is necessarily taken up with the description of what 
the conference consider the most suitable historical topics and the best methods of 
teaching history. This portion of the report does not admit of any useful presenta- 
tion in outline; it must be read in full. ~ 
With regard to examinations in history for admission to college, the conference 
protest “against the present lax and inefficient system,” and seem to sum up their 
own desires on this subject in the statement that “ the requirements for college ought 
to be so framed that the methods of teaching best adapted to mect them will also be 
best for all pupils.” 
Like the conferences on scientific subjects, the conference on history insist on 
notebooks, abstracts, special reports, and other written work as desirable means of 
teaching. If the recommendations of the nine conferences should be carried out in 
grammar and high schools, there would certainly be at least one written exercise a 
day for every pupil—a result which persons interested in training children to write 
English deem it important to accomplish. 
The observations of the conference on geographical training in connection with 
history are interesting and suggestive, as are also the recurring remarks on the need 
of proper apparatus for teaching history, such as maps, reference libraries, historical 
pictures, and photographs. It is not the natural sciences alone which need school 
apparatus. 
9. GEOGRAPHY. 
Considering that geography has been a subject of recognized value in elementary 
schools for many generations, and that a considerable portion of the whole school 
time of children has long been devoted to a study called by this name, it is some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1431 
what startling to find that the report of the conference on geography deals with 
more novelties than any other report, exhibits more dissatisfaction with prevailing 
methods, and makes, on the whole, the most revolutionary suggestions. This con- 
ference had but nine members present at its sessions, and before the final revision of 
its report had been accomplished one of the most valued of its members died. 
Seven members sign the majority report, and the minority report is presented by one 
member. The dissenting member, however, while protesting against the views of 
the majority on many points, concurs with the majority in some of the most impor- 
tant conclusions arrived at by the conference. 
It is obvious, on even a cursory reading of the majority and minority reports, that 
geography means for all the members of this conference something entirely different 
from the term “geography” as generally used in school programmes. Their definition 
of the word makes it embrace not only a description of the surface of the earth, but 
also the elements of botany, zoology, astronomy, and meteorology, as well as many 
considerations pertaining to commerce, government, and ethnology. ‘The physical 
environment of man” expresses as well as any single phrase can the conference’s 
conception of the principal subject which they wish to have. taught. No one can 
read the reports without perceiving that the advanced instruction in geography 
which the conference conceive to be desirable and feasible in high schools can not be 
given until the pupils have mastered many of the elementary facts of botany, 
zoology, geometry, and physics. It is noteworthy also that this ninth confergnee, 
like the seventh, dealt avowedly and unreservedly with the whole range of instruc- 
tion in primary and secondary schools. They did not pretend to treat chiefly - 
instruction in secondary schools, and incidentally instruction in the lower schools; 
but, on the contrary, grasped at once the whole problem, and described the topics, 
methods, and apparatus appropriate to the entire course of twelve years. They 
recognized that complete descriptions would be necessary in all three branches of 
the subject—topics, methods, and equipment; and they have given these descriptions 
with an amplitude and force which leave little to be desired. 
More distinctly than any other conference, they recognized that they 1 were pre- 
senting an ideal course which could not be carried into effect everywhere or imme- 
diately. Indeed, at several points they frankly state that the means of carrying out 
their recommendations are not at present readily accessible, and they exhibit the 
same anxiety which is felt by several other conferences about training teachers for 
the kind of work which the conference believe to be desirable. After the full and 
interesting descriptions of the relations and divisions of geographical science, as the 
conference define it, the most important sections of their report relate to the methods 
and means of presenting the subject in schools, and to the right order in developing 
it. The methods which they advocate require not only better equipped teachers, 
but better means of illustrating geographical facts in the schoolroom, such as charts, 
maps, globes, photographs, models, lantern slides, and lanterns. Like all the other 
conferences on scientific subjects, the ninth conference dwell on the importance of 
forming from the start good habits of observing correctly and stating accurately the 
facts observed. They also wish that the instruction in geography may be connected 
with the instruction in drawing, history, and English. They believe that meteorol- 
ogy may be taught as an observational study in the earliest years of the grammar 
school, the scholars being even then made familiar with the use of the thermometer, 
the wind vane, and the rain gauge; and that it may be carried much further in the 
high school years, after physics has been studied, so that the pupils may then attain 
a general understanding of topographical maps, of pressure and wind charts, of iso- 
thermal charts, and of such complicated subjects as weather prediction, rainfall and 
the distribution of rain, storms, and the seasonal variations of the atmosphere. 
Their conception of physiography is a very comprehensive one. In short, they 
recommend a study of physical geography which would embrace in its scope the 
elements of half a dozen natural sciences, and would bind together in one sheaf the 
various gleanings which the pupils would have gathered from widely separated
-P-A-G-E-214

fields. There can be no doubt that the study would be interesting, informing, and 
developing, or that it would be difficult and in every sense substantial. 
It already appears that the nine conferences have attended carefully to three out 
of the five subjects which it was the intention of the National Council of Education 
that they should examine. They have discussed fully the proper limits of the several 
subjects of instruction in secondary schools, the best methods of instruction, and 
the best methods of testing pupils’ attainments. The conferences were equally faith- 
ful in discussing the other two subjects committed to them by the council, namely, 
the most desirable allotment of time for each subject and the requirements for admis- 
sion. to college. 
The next subject which the committee of ten, following the guidance of the con- 
ferences, desire to present to the council is, therefore, the allotment of school time 
among the various subjects of study. It is the obvious duty of the committee, in 
the first place, to group together in tabular form the numerous suggestions on this 
subject made by the conferences. Having exhibited the programme time suggestions 
of the conferences, it will remain for the committee to construct a flexible and com- 
prehensive schedule of studies, based un the recommendations of the conferences.

    SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1435 
The preceding table exhibits the demands for programme time made by all the con- 
ferences. It will be seen at once that this table-does not yield, without modification, 
a practical programme. The nine conferences acted separately, and were studying 
each its own needs, ané not the comparative needs of all the subjects. 1t was vot for 
them to balance the different interests, but for each to present strongly one interest. 
It will further be noticed that some of their demands are not specific—that is, they 
do not call for any specified number of recitation periods for a definite number of 
weeks during a stated number of years. The conferences on languages and history 
are the most definite in their recommendations, the conferences on mathematics and 
the sciences being much less so. Table I is therefore not a programme, but the 
materials from which serviceable programmes may be constructed. 
The committee of ten deliberately placed in this one table the recommendations of 
the conferences for the clementary grades and the recommendations for secondary 
schools, in order that the sequence of the recommendations for each subject might 
be clearly brought out. The recommendations made for the secondary schools pre- 
suppose in many cases that the recommendations made for the elementary schools 
have been fulfilled; or, at least, in many cases the conferences would have made 
different recommendations for the secondary schools, if they had been compelled to 
act on the assumption that things must remain just as they are in the elementary 
schools. 
At this point it is well to call attention to the list of subjects which the confer- 
ences deal with as proper for secondary schools. They are: (1) Languages—Latin, 
Greek, English, German, and French (and locally Spanish); (2) mathematics—alge- 
bra, geometry, and trigonometry; (3) general history, and the intensive study of 
special epochs; (4) natural history—including descriptive astronomy, meteorology, 
botany, zoology, physiology, geology, and ethnology, most of which subjects may 
be conveniently grouped under the title of physical geography; and (5) physics and 
chemistry. The committee of ten assent to this list, both for what it includes and 
for what it excludes, with some practical qualifications to be mentioned below. 
Table II exhibits the total amount of instruction (estimated by the number of 
weekly periods assigned to each subject) to be given in a secondary school during 
each year of a four years’ course, on the supposition that the recommendations of 
the conferences are all carried ont.

  The method of estimating the amount of instruction offered in any subject by the 
number of recitation periods assigned to it each week for a given number of years 
or half years is in some respects an inadequate one, for it takes no account of the 
scope and intensity of the instruction given during the periods; but so far as it 
goes, it is trustworthy and instructive. It represents with tolerable accuracy the 
“proportional expenditure which a school is making.on a given subject, and therefore 
tho proportional importance which the school attaches to that subject. It also 
represents roughly the proportion of the pupil’s entire school time which he can 
devote to a given subject, provided he is free to take all the instruction offered in 
that subject. All experience shows that subjects deemed important get a large 
number of weekly periods, while those deemed unimportant get a small number. 
Moreover, if the programme time assigned to a given subject be insufficient, the 
value of that subject as training can not be got, no matter how good the quality 
of the instruction. 
very one of these years except the first contains much more instruction than any 
one pupil ean follow; but, looking at the bearing of the table on the important 
question of educational expenditure, it is encouraging to observe that there are 
already many secondary schools in this country in which quite as many subjects are 
taught as are mentioned in this table, and in which there are more weekly period: 
of instruction provided for separate classes than are found in any year of the table. 
In some urban high schools which provide from five to nine different courses of three 
to five years each, and in some endowed secondary schools which maintain two or 
three separate courses called classical, Latin-scientific, and English, or designated 
by similar titles, the total number of weekly periods of unrepeated instruction 
given to distinct classes is even now larger than the largest total of weekly periods 
found in Table II. The annual expenditure in such schools is sufficient to pro- 
vide all the instruction called for by Table II. The suggestions of the conferences 
presuppose that all the pupils of like intelligence and maturity in any subject study 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  - SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1437 
it in the same way and to the same extent, so long as they study it at all, this being 
a point on which all the conferences insist strongly. No provision is made, there- 
fore, for teaching Latin or algebra or history to one portion of a class four times a 
week, and to another portion of the same class only thrice or twice a week. Such 
provisions are very common in American schools, but the recommendations of the 
conferences, if put into effect, would do away With all expenditures of this sort. 
It clearly appears from Table II that the recommendations of the conferences on 
scientific subjects have been moderate so far as the proposed allotment of time t« 
them is concerned. The conferences on physics, chemistry and astronomy, natural 
history, and geography held one combined session in Chicago, and passed a resolu- 
tion that one-fourth of the whole high school course ought to be devoted to natural 
science, theirintention doubtless being that each pupil should devote one-quarter 
of his time to science; yet if all the time asked for in secondary schools by the sci- 
entific conferences be added together it will appear, first, that the rare pupil who 
should take all the scientific instruction provided would need for it only one-quarter 
of his time, and secondly, that less than one-sixth of the whole instruction to be 
given in accordance with the combined recommendations of all the conferences is 
devoted to subjects of natural science. The first year of the secondary school course 
according to Table II will contain no science at all; and it is only in the last. year 
of the secondary school that the proportion of natural science teaching rises to one- 
-fourth of the whole instruction. 
Instudying these two tables which result from the recommendations of the confer- 
ences, the committee of ten perceived at once that if the recommendations are to be 
earried out, so far as offering the instruction proposed is concerned, a selection of 
studies for the individual pupil must be made in the second, third, and fourth years 
of the secondary school course. This selection will obviously be made in different 
ways in different schools. Any school principal may say, ‘ With the staff at my 
command I can teach only five subjects out of those proposed by the conferences in 
the manner proposed. My school shail therefore be limited to these five.” Another 
school may be able to teach in the thorough manner proposed five subjects, but some 
or all of these five may be different from those selected by the first school. A larger 
or richer school may be able to teach all the subjects mentioned, and by the’ meth- 
ods and with the apparatus described. In the last case, each pupil, under the 
supervision of the teachers, and with the advice of parents or friends, may make 
choice between several different four-year courses arranged by the school; or, if 
the school authorities prefer, the pupil may be allowed to make year by year a care- 
fully guided choice among a limited number of subjects; or these two methods may 
be combined. Selection for the individual is necessary to thoroughness and to the 
imparting of power as distinguished from information, for any large subject what- 
ever to yield its training value must be pursued throughseveral years and be studied 
from three to five times a week; and if each subject studied is thus to claim a con- 
siderable fraction of the pupil’s school time, then clearly the individual pupil can 
give attention to only a moderate number of subjects. 
. In Table II the number of weekly periods assigned to a single subject varies from 
two to five, about half of the assignments being made for five periods a week. 
There is an obvious convenience in the number five because it ordinarily gives one 
period a day for five days in the week; but there is also an obvious disadvantage in 
making too free use of the number five. It practically limits to three or, at most, 
four the number of subjects which the individual pupil may pursue simultaneously ; 
and this limit is inexpedient.in a four years’ programme. 
The committee have therefore prepared the following modification of Table II, 
using four as the standard number of weekly periods, except in the first year of a 
new language, and in the few cases in which the conferences advise a number smaller 
than four, By this means the total number of periods is somewhat reduced, except 
in the first year, and the number of periods allotted to different subjects are made
-P-A-G-E-220

more consonant, each with the others. The result is only a correlation and adjust- 
ment of the recommendations of the conferences, no judgment or recommendation 
of the committee being expressed in it:

The adoption of the number four.as the standard number of weekly periods will 
not make it impossible to carry into effect the fundamental conception of all the 
conferences, namely, that all the subjects which make part of the secondary school 
course should be taught consecutively enough and extensively enough to make every - 
subject yield that training which it is best fitted to yield, provided that the pro- 
posed correlation and association of subjects are carried out in practice. With 
regard to the arrangement or sequence of subjects, the committee follow in this 
table the recommendations of the conferences with only slight modifications. They 
insert in the first year applied geography, using the term in the sense in which 
it is used by the conference on geography; and they make this insertion in order 
that natural science may be represented in the programme of that year, and that a 
complete break of continuity, as regards science subjects, between the eighth grade 
and the second year of the secondary school may be avoided. They. have felt 
obliged to put physics into the third year and chemistry into the fourth, in order 
.that the subject of physics may precede meteorology and physiography; and they 
have slightly increased the number of lessons in astronomy. With regard to the 
proportions of school time to be devoted to the different subjects, Table III reduces 
somewhat the proportional time devoted to Latin, English, and mathematics, and 
increases the proportional time to be devoted to natural science. In a secondary 
school which teaches all the subjects recommended by the conferences, and to the 
extent contemplated in Table III, nearly one-fifth of the whole instruction given 
will be devoted to natural science.
-P-A-G-E-221
    SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1439 
The committee regard Table III not, of course, as a feasible programme,but as 
the possible source of a great variety of good secondary school programmes. It 
would be difficult to make a bad programme out of the materials contained in this 
table, unless indeed the fundamental principles advocated by the conferences should 
be neglected. With some reference to Table I, excellent six-year and five-year 
programmes for secondary schools can readily be constructed by spreading the sub- 
jects contained in Table III over six or five years instead of four—of course with 
some changes in the time allotment. 
The details of the time allotment for the several studies which enter into the 
secondary school programme may seem to some persons mechanical, or even trivial— 
a technical matter to be dealt with by each superintendent of schools, or by each 
principal of a secondary school, acting on his own individual experience and judg- 
ment; but such is not the opinion of the committee of ten. The committee believe 
that to establish just proportions between tho several subjects, or groups of allied 
subjects, on which the conferences were held, it is essential that each principal sub- 
ject shall be taught thoroughly and extensively, and, therefore, for an adequate num- 
ber of periods a week on the school programme. If twice as much time is given in 
a school to Latin as is given to mathematics, the attainments of the pupils in Latin 
ought to be twice as great as they are in mathematics, provided that equally good 
work is done in the two subjects, and Latin will have twice the educational value 
of mathematics. Again, if in a secondary school Latin is steadily pursued for four 
years with four or five hours a week devoted to it, that subject will be worth more 
to the pupil than the sum of half a dozen other subjects, each of which has one- 
sixth of the time allotted to Latin. The good effects of continuous study in one 
subject will be won for the pupil through the Latin, and they will not be won 
through the six other subjects among which only so much time as is devoted to the 
single language has been divided, If every subject studied at all is to be studied 
thoroughly and consecutively, every subject must receive an adequate time allot- 
ment. If every subject is to provide a substantial mental training, it must have a 
time allotment sufficient to produce that fruit. Finally, since selection must be exer- 
cised by or on behalf of the individual pupil, all the subjects between which choice 
is allowed should be approximately equivalent to cach other in seriousness, dignity, 
and efficacy. Therefore they should have approximately equal time allotments. 
The conferences haye abundantly shown how every subject which they recommend 
can be made a serious subject of instruction, well fitted to train the pupil’s powers 
of observation, expression, and reasoning. It remains for makers of school pro- 
grammes to give every subject the chance of developing a good training capacity by 
giving it an adequate time allotment. a 
The schedule of studies contained in Table II permits flexibility and variety in 
three respects. First, it is not necessary that any school sheuld teach all the sub- 
jects which it contains, or any particular set of subjects. Secondly, it is not neces- 
sary that the individual pupil should everywhere and always have the same number 
of periods of instruction per week. In one school the pupils might have but sixteen 
periods a week, in another twenty; or in some years of the course the pupils might 
have more periods a week than in other years. Within the schedule many particu- 
lar arrangements for the convenience of a school or for the welfare of an individual 
pupil would be possible. Thirdly, it is not necessary that every secondary school 
should begin its work at the level which is assumed as the starting point of second- 
ary instruction in Tables I, II, and II. If in any community the high school has no 
such grammar school foundation beneath it as is imagined in Table I it will simply 
have to begin its work lower down in the table. The sequence of studies recom- 
mended by the conferences would still serve as a guide; but the demarcation between 
the elementary schools and the high school would oceur in that community at a 
lower point. From this point of view Tables I, II, and III may be considered to set 
a standard toward which secondary schools should tend, and not a standard to 
which they can at once conform.

The adoption of a programme based on Table IIT would not necessarily change at 
all the relation of a school to the colleges or universities to which it habitually 
sends pupils. Any such programme would lend itself either to the examination 
method of admission to college, or to the certificate method; and it could be slightly 
modified in such a way as to meet the present admission requirements of any college 
in the country. Future changes in admission requirements might fairly be made ~ 
with a view to the capabilities of programmes based on Table III. 
As samples of school programmes constructed within the schedules of Table III, 
the committee present the following working programmes, which they recommend 
for trial wherever the secondary school period is limited to four years. All four 
combined might, of course, be tabulated as one programme with options by subject. 
These four programmes taken together use all the subjects mentioned in Table 
III, and usually, but not always, to about the amounts there indicated. History and 
English suffer serious contraction in the classical programme. , All four programmes 
conform to the general recommendations of the conferences, that is, they treat each 
subject in the same way for all pupils with trifling exceptions; they give time 
enough to each subject to win from it the kind of mental training it is fitted to sup- 
ply; they put the different principal subjects on an approximate equality so far as 
time allotment is concerned; they omit all short information courses; and they make 
sufficiently continuous the instruction in each of the main lines, namely, language, 
science, history, andmathematics. With slight modifications, they would prepare the 
pupils for admission to appropriate courses in any American college or university on 
the existing requirements, and they would also meet the new college requirements 
which are suggested below. 
In preparing these programmes, the committee were perfectly aware that it is 
impossible to make a satisfactory secondary school programme, limited to a period 
of four years, and founded on the present elementary school subjects and methods. 
In the opinion of the committee, several subjects now reserved for high schools, 
such as algebra, geometry, natural science, and foreign languages, should be begun 
earlier than now, and therefore within the schools classified as elementary; or, as 
an alternative, the secondary school period should be made to begin two years earlier 
than at present, leaving six years instead of eight for the elementary school périod. 
Under the present organization, elementary subjects and elementary methods are, in 
the judgment of the committee, kept in use too long. 
The most striking differences in the four programmes will be found, as is intimated 
in the headings, in the relative amounts of time given to foreign languages. In the 
classical programme the foreign languages get a large share of time; in the English 
programme asmallshare. In compensation, English and history are more developed 
in the English programme than in the classical. 
Many teachers will say, at first sight, that physics comes too early in these pro- 
grammes and Greek too late. One member of the committee is firmly of the opinion 
that Greek comes too late. The explanation of the positions assigned to these sub- 
jects is that the committee of ten attached great importance to two general principles 
in programme making. In the first place, they endeavored to postpone till the third 
year the grave choice between the classical course and the Latin-scientific. They 
believed that this bifurcation should occur as late as possible, since the choice 
between these two roads often determines for life the youth’s career. Moreover, 
they believed that itis possible to make this important decision for a boy on good 
grounds only when he has had opportunity to exhibit his quality and discover his 
tastes by making excursions into all the principal fields of knowledge. The youth 
who has never studied any but his native language can not know his own capacity 
for linguistic acquisition; and the youth who has never made a chemical or physical 
experiment can not know whether or not he has a taste for exact science. The 
wisest teacher, or the most observant parent, can hardly predict with confidence a 
boy’s gift for a subject which he has never touched. In these considerations the 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1444 
committee found strong reasons for postponing bifurcation and making the subjects. 
of the first two years as truly representative as possible. Secondly, inasmuch as. 
many boys and girls who begin the secondary school course do not stay in school 
more than two years, the committee thought it important to select the studies of 
the first two years in such a way that linguistic, historical, mathematical, and 
scientific subjects should all be properly represented. Natural history being repre- 
sented by physical geography, the committee wished physics to represent the inor- 
ganic sciences of precision. The first two years of any one of the four programmes 
presented above will, in the judgment of the committee, be highly profitable by 
  
    
    themselves to children who can go no further. x

In the construction of the sample programmes the committee adopted twenty as 
the maximum number of weekly periods, but with two qualifications, namely, that 
at least five of the twenty periods should be given unprepared work, and that labo- 
ratory subjects should have double periods whenever that prolongation should be 
possible. 
The omission of music, drawing, and elocution from the programmes offered by the 
committee was not intended to imply that these subjects ought to receive no system- 
It was merely thought best to leave it to local school authorities to 
determine, without suggestions from the committee, how these subjects should be 
introduced into the programmes in addition to the subjects reported on by tho atic attention.

‘SECONDARY SCHOUL STUDIES. 1443 
  The committee were governed in the construction of the first three programmes 
by the rule laid down by the language conferences, namely, that two foreign lan- 
guages should not be begun at the same time. To obey this rule is to accept strict 
limitations in the construction of a four years’ classical programme. A five years’ or 
six years’ programme can be made much more easily under this restriction. The 
committee were anxious to give five weekly periods to every foreign language in the 
year when it was first attacked, but did not find it possible to do so in every case. 
The four programmes can be carried out economically in a single school, because, 
with a few inevitable exceptions, the several subjects occur simultaneously in at 
least three programmes and with the same number of weekly periods. 
Numerous possible transpositions of subjects will occur to every experienced teacher | 
who examines these specimen programmes. Thus, in some localities it would be 
better to transpese French and German; the selection and order of science subjects 
might be varied considerably to suit the needs or circumstances of different schools, 
and the selection and order of historical subjects admit of large variety. 
Many subjects now familiar in secondary school courses of study do not appear in 
Table III or in the specimen programmes given above, but it must not be supposed 
that the omitted subjects are necessarily to be neglected. If the recommendations 
of the conference were carried out, some of the omitted subjects would be better 
dealt with under any one of the above programmes than they are now under familiar 
high school and academy programmes in which they figuro as separate subjects. 
Thus, drawing does not appear as a separate subject in the specimen programmes, 
but the careful reader of the conference reports will notice that drawing, both 
mechanical and free-hand, is to be used in the study of history, botany, zoology, 
astronomy, meteorology, physics, geography, and physiograpby, and that the kind 
of drawing recommended by the conference is the most useful kind, namely, that 
which is applied to recording, describing, and discussing observations. This abun- 
dant use of drawing might not prevent the need of some special instruction in draw- 
ing, but it ought to diminish the number of periods devoted exclusively to drawing. 
Again, neither ethics nor economics, neither metaphysics nor esthetics appear in the 
programmes, but in the large number of periods devoted to English and history there 
would be some time for incidental instruction in the elements of these subjects. It 
is through the reading and writing required of pupils, or recommended to them, 
that the fundamental ideas on these important topics are to be inculeated. Again, 
the industrial and commercial subjects do not appear in these programmes, but 
bookkeeping and commercial arithmetic are provided for by the option for algebra 
designated in Table III; and if it were desired to provide more amply for subjects 
thought to have practical importance in trade or the useful arts, it would be easy to 
provide options in such subjects for some of the sciences contained in the third and 
fourth years of the ‘‘English” programme. 
The committee of ten think much would be gained if, in addition to the usual pro- 
gramme hours, a portion of Saturday morning should be regularly used for laboratory 
work in the scientific subjects. Laboratory work requires more consecutive time 
than the ordinary period of recitation affords; so that an hour and a half is about 
the shortest advantageous period for a laboratory exercise. The committee venture 
to suggest further that, in addition to the regular school sessions in the morning, 
one afternoon in every week should be used for out-of-door instruction in geography, 
botany, zoology, and geology, these afternoon and Saturday morning exercises bemg 
counted as regular work for the teachers who conduct them. In all laboratory and 
field work, the committee believe that it will be found profitable to employ as assist- 
ants to the regular teachers—particularly at the beginning of laboratory and field 
work in each subject—recent graduates of the secondary schools who have them- 
selves followed the laboratory and field courses; for at the beginning the pupil will 
need a large amount of individual instruction in the manipulation of specimens, the 
use of instruments, and the prompt recording of observations. One teacher without

  1444 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
assistants can not supervise effectively the work of 30 or 40 pupils, either in the 
laboratory or in the field. The laboratory work on Saturday mornings could be 
maintained throughout the school year; the afternoon excursions would of course be 
difficult, or impossible, for perhaps a third of the school year. 
In general, the committee of ten have endeavored to emphasize the principles 
which should govern all secondary school programmes, and to show how the main 
recommendations of the several conferences may be carried out in a variety of 
feasible programmes. 
One of the subjects which the committee of ten were directed to consider was 
requirements for admission to college, and particularly they were expected to report 
‘on uniform requirements for admission to colleges, as well as on a uniform secondary 
school programme. Almost all the conferences have something to say about the best 
mode of testing the attainments of candidates at college admission examinations, 
and some of them, notably the conferences on history and geography, make very 
explicit declarations concerning the nature of college examinations. The improve- 
ments desired in the mode of testing the attainments of pupils who have pursued 
in the secondary schools the various subjects which entér into the course will be 
found clearly described under each subject in the several conference reports, but 
there is a general principle concerning the relation of the secondary schools to col- 
leges which the committee of ten, inspired and guided by the conferences, feel it 
their duty to set forth with all possible distinctness. 
The secondary schools of the United States, taken as a whole, do not exist for the 
purpose of preparing boys and girls for colleges. Only an insignificant percentage 
of the graduates of these schools go to colleges or scientific schools. Their main 
function is to prepare for the duties of life that small proportion of all the children 
in the country—a proportion small in number, but very important to the welfare of 
the nation—who show themselves able to profit by an education prolonged to the 
eighteenth year, and whose parents are able to support them while they remain so 
long at school. There are, to be sure, a few private or endowed secondary schools 
in the country which make it their principal object to prepare students for the col- 
leges and universities, but the number of these schools is relatively small. A sec- 
ondary school programme intended for national use must therefore be made for those 
children whose education is not to be pursued beyond the secondary school. The 
preparation of a few pupils for college or scientific school should in the ordinary 
secondary school be the incidental and not the principal object. At the same time, 
it is obviously desirable that the colleges and scientific schools should be accessible 
to all boys or girls who have completed creditably the secondary school course. 
Their parents often do not decide for them, four years before the college age, that 
they shall go to college, and they themselves may not, perhaps, feel the desire to 
continue their education until near the end of their school course. In order that 
any successful graduate of a good secondary school should be free to present himself 
at the gates of the college or scientific school of his choice, it is necessary that the 
colleges and scientific schools of the country should accept for admission to appro- 
priate courses of their instruction the attainments of any youth who has passed 
ereditably through a good secondary school course, no matter to what group of sub- 
jects he may have mainly devoted himself in the secondary school. As secondary 
school courses are now too often arranged, this is not a reasonable request to prefer 
to the colleges and scientific schools, because the pupil may now go through a 
secondary school course of a very feeble and scrappy nature—studying a little of 
many subjects and not much of any one, getting, perhaps, a little information in a 
variety of fields, but nothing which can be called a thorough training. 
Now the recommendations of the nine conferences, if well carried out, might 
fairly be held to make all the main subjects taught in the secondary schools of equal 
rank for the purposes of admission to college or scientific school. They would all 
be taught consecutively and thoroughly, and would all be carried on in the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1445 
  spirit; they would all be used for training the powers of observation, memory, 
expression, and reasoning; and they would all be good to that end, although differ- 
ing among themselves in quality and substance. In preparing the programmes of 
Table IV, the committee had in mind that the requirements for admission to colleges 
might, for schools which adopted a programme derived from that table, be simplified 
to a considerable extent, though not reduced. A college might say: We will accept 
for admission any groups of studies taken from the secondary school programme, 
provided that the sum of the studies in each of the four years amounts to sixteen, or 
eighteen, or twenty periods a week—as may be thought best—and provided, further, 
that in each year at least four of the subjects presented shall have been pursued at 
least three periods a week, and that at least three of the subjects shall have been 
pursued three years or more. For the purposes of this reckoning, natural history, 
geography, meteorology, and astronomy might be grouped together as one subject. 
Every youth who entered college would have spent four years in studying a few sub- 
jects thoroughly; and, on the theory that all the subjects are to be considered equiv- 
alent in educational rank for the purposes of admission to college, it would make no 
difference which subjects he had chosen for the programme—he would have had four 
years of strong and effective mental training. The conferences on geography and 
modern languages make the most explicit statement to the effect that college require- 
ments for admission should coincide with high-school requirements for graduation. 
The conference on English is of opinion ‘that no student should be admitted to col- 
lege who shows in his English examination and his other examinations that he is 
very deficient in ability to write good English.” This recommendation suggests 
that an ample English course in the secondary school should be required of all per- 
sons who intend to enter college. It would of course be possible for any college to 
require for admission any one subject, or any group of subjects, in the table, and 
the requirements of different colleges, while all kept within the table, might differ 
in many respects; but the committee are of opinion that the satisfactory comple- 
tion of any one of the four years’ courses of study embodied in the foregoing pro- 
grammes should admit to corresponding courses in colleges and scientific schools. 
They believe that this close articulation between the secondary schools and the 
higher institutions would be advantageous alike for the schools, the colleges, and 
the country. - 
Every reader of this report and of the reports of the nine conferences will be satis- 
fied that to carry out the improvements proposed more highly trained teachers will 
be needed than are now ordinarily to be found for the service of the elementary and 
secondary schools. The committee of ten desire to point out some of the means of - 
procuring these better trained teachers. For the further instruction of teachers in 
actual service, three agencies already in existence may be much better utilized than 
they now are. Thesummer schools which many universities now maintain might be 
resorted to by much larger numbers of teachers, particularly if some aid, such as the 
payment of tuition fees and traveling expenses, should be given to teachers who are 
willing to devote half of their vacations to study, by the cities and towns which 
these teachers serve. Secondly, in all the towns and cities in which colleges and 
universities are planted, these colleges or universities may usefully give stated 
courses of instruction in the main subjects used in the elementary and secondary 
schools to teachers employed in those towns and cities. This is a reasonable service 
which the colleges and universities may render to their own communities. ‘Thirdly, 
a superintendent who has himself become familiar with the best mode of teaching 
any one of the subjects which enter into the school course can always be a very use- 
ful instructor for the whole body of teachers under his charge. A real master of any 
one subject will always have many suggestions to make to teachers of other subjects. 
The same is true of the principal of a high school, or other leading teacher in a town 
or city. In every considerable city school system the best teacher in each depart- 
ment of instruction should be enabled to give part of his time to helping the other  
-P-A-G-E-228
  1446 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
teachers by inspecting and criticising their work, and showing them, both by precept 
and example, how to do it better. 
In regard to preparing young men and women for the business of teaching, the 
country has a right to expect much more than it has yet obtained from the colleges 
and normal schools. The common expectation of attainment for pupils of the nor- 
mal schools has been altogether too low the country over. The normal schools, as 
a class, themselves need better apparatus, libraries, programmes, and teachers. As 
to the colleges, it is quite as much an enlargement of sympathies as an improvement 
of apparatus or of teaching that they need. They cought to take more interest than 
they have heretofore done, not only in the secondary, but in the elementary schools; 
and they ought to take pains to fit men well for the duties of a school superintend- 
ent. They already train a considerable number of the best principals of high 
schools and academies; but this is not sufficient. They should take an active inter- 
est, through their presidents, professors, and other teachers, in improving the schools 
in their respective localities, and in contributing to the thorough discussion of all 
questions affecting the welfare of both the elementary and the secondary schools. 
Finally, the committee venture to suggest, in the interest of secondary schools, 
that uniform dates—such as the last Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, or the third 
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of June and September—be established for the 
admission examinations of colleges and scientific schools throughout the United 
States. It isa serious inconvenience for secondary schools which habitually pre- 
pare candidates for several different colleges or scientific schools that the admission 
examinations of different institutions are apt to occur on different dates, sometimes 
rather widely separated. : 
‘The committee also wish to call attention to the service which schools of law, medi- 
“cine, engineering, and technology, whether connected with universities or not, can 
render to secondary education by arranging their requirements for admission, as 
regards selection and range of subjects, in conformity with the courses of study 
recommended by the committee. By bringing their entrance requirements into 
close relation with any or all of the programmes recommended for secondary schools, 
these professional schools can give valuable support to high schools, academies, and 
preparatory schools.

President Baker signs the above report, but adds the following statement: 
To the National Council of Education: 
I beg leave to note some exceptions taken to parts of the report of the committee 
of ten. Had the committee not been limited in time, doubtless fuller discussion 
would have resulted in modifying some statements embodied in the report. The 
great value of the reports of the conferences upon the subjects referred to them, as 
to matter, place, time, methods, adequate and continuous work for each subject, 
and identity of work in different courses, and the masterly summary and tabulation 
of their recommendations, made by the chairman of the committee of ten, can but 
invite cordial commendation. Objections are raised to parts of the special work of 
the committee. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1447 
  (1) I can not indorse expressions that appear to sanction the idea that the choice 
of subjects in secondary schools may be a matter of comparative indifference. I 
note especially the following sentences, referring the reader to their context for 
accurate interpretation: 
“Any school principal may say: ‘With the staff at my command I can teach only 
five subjects out of those proposed by the conferences in the manner proposed. My 
school shall, therefore, be limited to these five.’ Another school may be able to 
teach in the thorough manner proposed five subjects, but some or all of these five 
may be different from those selected by the first school.” 
“Tf twice as much time is given in a school to Latin as is given to mathematics, 
the attainments of the pupils in Latin ought to be twice as great as they are in 
mathematics, provided that equally good work is done in the two subjects, and 
Latin will have twice the educational value of mathematics.” 
“The schedule of studies contained in Table III permits flexibility and variety in 
three respects. First, it is not necessary that any school should teach all the sub- 
jects which it contains, or any particular set of subjects.” 
“Every youth who entered college would have spent four years in studying a few 
subjects thoroughly; and on the theory that all subjects are to be considered equiv- 
alent in educational rank for the purpose of admission to college, it would make no 
difference which subjects he had chosen from the programme—he would have had 
four years of strong and effective mental training.” 
All such statements are based upon the theory that for the purposes of general 
education one study is as good as another, a theory which appears to me to ignore 
philosophy, psychology, and science of education. Itis a theory which makes educa- 
tion formal and does not consider the nature and value of the content. Power comes 
through knowledge; we cannot conceive of observation and memory in the abstract, 
The world which offers to the human mind several distinct views is the world in 
which our power that comes through knowledge is to be used, the world which we 
are to understand and enjoy. The relation between the subjective power and the 
objective—or subjective—knowledge is inseparable and vital. On any other theory, 
for general education, we might well consider the study of Egyptian hieroglyphics 
as valuable as that of physics and Choctaw as important as Latin. Secondary school 
programmes can not well omit mathematics, or science, or history, or literature, or 
the culture of the ancient classics. An education which gives a view in all directions 
is the work of elementary and secondary schools. Such an education is the neces- 
sary preparation for the special work of the university student. If [rightly under- 
stood, the majority of the committee rejected the theory of equivalence of studies 
for general education. 
Studies vary in value for the training of the different powers, and for this addi- 
tional reason the choice can not be regarded as a matter of indifference. 
The training of “observation, memory, expression, and reasoning” (inductive) is 
avery important part of education, but is not all of education. The imagination, 
deductive reasoning, the rich possibilities of emotional life, the education of the will 
through ethical ideas and correct habit, all are to be considered in a scheme of learn- 
ing. Ideals are to be added to the scientific method. 
The dilemma which appears on an examination of the time demands of the various 
conferences offers to the programme maker the alternatives of omitting essential sub- 
jects and of a rational adjustment of the time element, while retaining all essential 
subjects. Reason and experience point toward the latter alternative. By wise 
selection of matter within the lines of study adequate and consecutive time can be 
given to each. 
(2) The language of the second paragraph following Table II might be miseon- 
strued to mean that the committee favor the multiplication of courses with a loss of 
the thoroughness attainable when the teaching force is devoted to one or two courses. 
Intention rather than extension of effort, both in respect to the number of courses   
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  1448 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
“and in respect to the number of studies or topics under each principal subject, is to 
be strongly recommended. 
(3) It may seem trivial to offer criticism of the specimen programmes made by the 
committee, and yet I believe that each member felt that with ample deliberation 
results somewhat different would have been reached. Note for instance that in some 
of the programmes history is entirely omitted in the second year, and physics is given 
only three hours per week—no more time than is allowed for botany or zoology. 
There are many symmetrical secondary school programmes in actual operation to-day 
which furnish continuous instruction in all important subjects throughout the four 
years, allowing to each an amount of time adequate to good results. For most high 
schools the first, the classical programme, and the last programme, the one offering 
one foreign language, will commend themselves because they are economical, and 
they combine a good finishing course with adequate college preparation, 
(4) On the basis of the tabulated results of the conferences I believe that by earnest 
scientific examination a scheme of work can be formulated that will meet the views 
of the members of the committee and of most educators. As an afterthought it may 
be an occasion for regret that tho strength of the discussion was not devoted to 
Table III. Instead of considering the work of the committee as ended, I would 
recommend that the National Council hold itself responsible for further examination 
of the data furnished by the conferences. I have not presumed to offer a substitute 
report, because I believe that the importance of the work demands further effort of 
an entire committee.

THE REFORM OF SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.! 
By Nicnoias Murray BurTier. 
It has come to be distinctly recognized that any far-reaching educational reform in 
this country must begin with the secondary schools. The elementary school is help- 
less if the secondary school refuses to cooperate with it in raising the standard of 
scholarship and improving the methods of instruction, and but few colleges are 
strong enough to demand of the secondary schools more and better work than the 
latter are now doing. Persuasion on the part of the colleges has in some cases 
accomplished a good deal, but the improvement has been limited either to one or 
two subjects of instruction, or to the schools of a relatively small territory. The 
secondary schools themselves, not always conducted in a wise or generous spirit, 
have too often sacrificed the necessities of sound training to the local demand for 
an ambitious programme containing two score or more of school subjects, no one of 
which is pursued far enough or long enough for the pupil to derive from it the edu- 
cational value it possesses; or, they have erred on the other side, and in the devo- 
tion to a past ideal excluded from the curriculum whole fields of knowledge that have 
grown up withina century. Thus thesecondary school has appeared to many observ- 
ers not only to scatter a pupil’s energies and interests, but to delay him unduly. 
The consequence is, as President Eliot showed very clearhy several years ago, that 
the American boy of 15 or 16, no whit inferior to his French or German fellow in 
native ability, is from two to three years behind him in acquired knowledge. 
To remedy so apparent an evil as this would be an easy task in France or in 
Prussia. The minister of education would consult his official advisers and call 
the leading educational experts to his council, in a few weeks an order would 
issue prescribing for the schools a new and reformed procedure. In this way, 
Lehrpliine and Lehraufgaben for the higher schools of Prussia were issued in 1882, 
and again in 1892. Similarly, in 1890 the existing Plan d’Ktudes et Programmes of

  the secondary schools in France was promulgated. In this country, however, where 
no central educational administration exists, and where bureaucracy is not popu- 
Jar, educational reforms can be brought about only by persuasion and cooperation, 
for no official and no institution is empowered to dictate to us. The press, the plat- 
form, the teachers’ meeting, must be availed of to put forward new ideas, and men 
and women in large numbers must be reasoned with and convinced in order to 
secure their acceptance. 
For secondary education, and through it for our educational organization generally, 
a long step has been taken in this direction by the proceedings that led up to the 
appointment of the committee of ten by the National Educational Association, and 
by the exceedingly valuable report which that committee has just laid before the 
public. 
For thirty years the National Educational Association has been known as a large 
body of teachers that assembled annually to listen to addresses and discussions of 
more or less practical value. It has come to command an attendance of as many as 
16,000 teachers of all classes and from every section of the country. Its power and 
authority have increased with its size and its representative character. In 1892, the 
directors of this association determined to pass from the field of mere discussion, and 
begin an educational investigation, under their own auspices and paid for out of 
their own funds, that should result in some practical gain to the country at large. 
They accepted the suggestion, made to them after careful deliberation, that the prob- 
lems connected with secondary education should be vigorously and systematically 
attacked, and appointed a committee, which has come to be known as the committee 
of ten, to take full charge of the task, at the same time appropriating $2,500 to pay 
the expenses of the work. The members of this committee were carefully selected 
with a view to giving representation to the types of educational organization most 
interested, and to the various sections of the country. 
As finally constituted, the committee was made up of one president of an Eastern 
university, two presidents of Western State universities, and one of a Southern State 
university, one president of a college for women, one professor in a Western college 
open to both sexes, one headmaster of an endowed academy, one principal of a public 
high school for both sexes, one principal of a public high school for girls only, and 
the Commissioner of Education, whose familiarity with the principles and practice 
of education in every part of the United States gave representation, indirectly, both 
to the elementary school interest and to the special students of education. 
The procedure adopted by the committee of ten is fully described in the report to 
which it is the object of this paper to direct attention. It may be briefly stated 
thus: 
After-a study of the whole problem, it was decided to appoint nine conferences of 
ten members each—one conference for each of the main divisions of work that. fall 
properly to the secondary school. The members of the conferences were selected 
equally, as nearly as possible, from college and school instructors who had attained 
a reputation in connection with the subject of their conference, due regard being had 
also to the representation of various educational interests and the several sections 
of the country. * * * The seyeral conferences assembled in December, 1892, at 
convenient points, and 88 of the 90 members were in attendance. Of these 88, 46 
were in the service of colleges and universities, 41 in the service of schools, and L 
was a government official formerly in the service of a university. So admirable are 
the lists of members of these conferences that it is difficult to speak of them without 
enthusiasm. Among the 90 names will be found many that stand in the foremost 
rank of American scholarship, and no one of the 90 was without valuable educational 
experience of some kind. This fact of itself gives great weight to their recommen- 
dations, and their exhaustive reports, which are appended to the report of the com 
mittee of ten, are a mine of educational information and suggestion of the utmost 
pues = tet

1450 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  The first impression produced by a study of the reports of the special confer- 
ences is that their members addressed themselves to their task with marked skill 
and directness. The questions submitted to them are answered, and answered fully, 
and the answers are accompanied with the reasons therefor. From the standpoint 
of the old-fashioned preparatory schoolmaster, ignorant alike of the newer school 
subjects and of the newer methods of imparting life to the old ones, the changes 
“urged by the conferences may seem many and radical. Yet it will be difficult to 
disprove the deliberate conclusion of the committee of ten that, on the whole, the 
spirit of the conferences was conservative and moderate. For example, the Latin 
conference distinctly disclaim any desire to sce the college admission requirements 
in Latin increased. The Greek conference prefer to see the average age of entrance 
to college lowered rather than raised. The mathematics conference recommend the 
actual abridging of the time now devoted to arithmetic, algebra, and geometry. 
The geography conference agree that the time now spent upon that subject in the 
schools is out of all proportion to the value of the results secured. 
As a matter of course, the conferences that dealt with the modern languages 
and tho several departments of natural science had the largest amount of work to 
do. Greek, Latin, and mathematics have been staple school subjects for generations. 
They aro carefully organized and graded. Adequate text-books are provided. A 
large body of teaching experience lies behind each of them. Of the other subjects 
this is not true. They appear only sporadically in schools. Too often they are 
taught badly, and their educational value is lost. The conferences dealing with the 
modern subjects make it clear in every case how these evils may be avoided; but 
their reports are correspondingly longer and more minute than those on the other 
subjects. The conferences on physics, astronomy, and chemistry, for example, 
append to their reports an elaborate outline of experiments to be performed and 
topics to be taught in the secondary school. The reports from the conferences on 
history, civil government, and political economy, geography, and natural history 
are similarly detailed. 
The recommendations of the conference on English will naturally be turned to 
first; for the tendency to emphasize the importance of the study of the mother 
tongue, and to improve the methods of teaching it, is now too strong and too gen- 
eral to be resisted, if indeed anyone wishes to resist it. The report of this confer- 
encé is very short, but it is extremely clear and cogent. In substance, it says that 
the proper use of English can only be gained by using it properly in exercises of 
increasing difficulty and variety. The spelling book is discountenanced. Formal 
grammar is relegated to the subordinate place that it deserves. The reading book 
should contain real literature, and not articles on physical science or natural history; 
and but little sentimental poetry. In the high school it is held that English should 
have as much time allotted to it as Latin, and that the two points to be kept con- 
stantly in mind in the teaching are the study of literature and training in the 
expression of thought. All this advice is so sound that, being now given a quasi- 
official authority, it should be followed generally in the secondary schools, both 
public and private. 
The fact that education can not be cut up into artificial periods distinct in them- 
selves is brought out by almost every conference. They agree in saying that the 
elementary school must improve, and must cooperate with the secondary school if the 
latter is to meet the demands now made uponit. English teaching can not be neg- 
lected from 6 to 13 if good results in it are to be obtained from 13 to 17. It is facts 
like this that give the reports of the conferences their chief significance. Though 
dealing ostensibly and directly with secondary education only, they reach every nook 
and corner of the elementary school as well. 
Tt is extremely encouraging, also, to find the nine conferences and the committee 
of ten, 100 teachers in all, in cordial agreement on many points of fundamental 
importance. It is laid down, for instance, that no school subject should be taught 
in different ways to pupils who are going to college, to a scientific school, or to neither.
-P-A-G-E-233
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1451 
  If a pupil studies algebra or Latin he should study it in the same way and to the 
same extent during the time that he studies it, whether he is to enter Harvard or 
Yale, the Institute of Technology or the Rensselaer Polytechnic, or a merchant's 
office. On this point there is not a single dissenting voice. This one principle, if 
followed in the secondary schools, would immensely simplify their programmes and 
decrease the cost of their instruction. 
The conferences agree again—excepting the Greek conference, the members of 
which had no reason for dealing with the subject—that much work now taken up 
for the first time in the secondary school should be begun in the elementary school. 
One foreign language, for instance, history, algebra, and geometry are all capable 
of excellent use in the upper grades of elementary schools, and are already to be 
found there in some of the more progressive cities of the country. The discussion 
on shortening and enriching the school curriculum begun so recently has already 
accomplished thus much. 
The four conferences on language study and the three on natural science also agree 
among themselves as to the best methods of teaching. The former are a unit in 
desiring reading aloud in the language to be studied, the association gf writing the 
language with translating from it, and the careful correction of translation in order 
to secure in it the use of accurate and idiomatic English. The three scientific eon- 
ferences come to a like agreement. They all believe that laboratory teaching is 
better than text-book teaching, and that the inspection of laboratery notebooks 
should be combined with written examinations in testing a pupil’s attainments. 
The last and most important point of agreement among the conferences relates 
to the coordination of the studies in the curriculum. Neither the committee of ten 
nor the conferences contained a single person who may bo classed as a follower of 
the Herbartian educational theory as exemplified by Ziller, Stoy, and Rein; yet 
by purely empirical methods the committee and the conferences arrive at a strik- 
ing confirmation of one of the main doctrines of the Herbartians, the coordination 
and correlation of studies. The scientific conferences show how the practice of writ- 
ing accurate descriptions of observations and experiments contributes to the require- 
ment of a clear, simple, English style. The conference on history wish toe have that 
subject always associated with the study of geography, and the conference on the 
latter subject agree withthem. The English conference explicitly ask that the study 
of the mother tongue and its literature be supplemented by that of the history and 
geography of the English-speaking race. 
Taking these points alone, and passing over the hundred and one questions of 
detail on which the conferences pronounce, we have a considerable body of eduea- 
tional doctrine that is sound to the core and that applies to one school and to one 
stage of education as well as to another. Principals of schools, teachers of special 
subjects, and students of education will examine and weigh carefully every recom- 
mendation of the conferences, however minute; but the general reader and the 
intelligent parent wish most of all to gain an idea of what is unanimously or even 
generally agreed upon. That question is substantially answered in the foregoing 
summary of the conference reports. 
To study carefully the several conference reports, and to base upon them a gen- 
eral recommendation to the country, was the more difficult part of the task of the 
committee of ten. Any recommendation, to be tangible, must, of course, include a 
schedule showing how a school can arrange its programme so as to carry out the 
ideal of the committee. Four such schedules or tables are given by the commit- 
tee; and while not perfect—what school programme is ?—they are extremely sugges- 
tive. The first table is not a programme, but an ordered arrangement, by topics and 
school years, of all the recommendations of the nine conferences. It offers material 
for a thousand programmes. The second table is given to test the practical charac- 
ter of the conference recommendations. Itincludes them all in a four years’ course, 
adding to each subject the number of weekly periods to be allotted to it. When
-P-A-G-E-234
  1452 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  this is done it is found that for three-fourths of the course much more is demanded 
than any one pupil can follow, but—and this is the important point—not more than 
aschool can teach. The necessary consequence is that there must be in the high 
school a choice or election of studies. In a small school this choice will be made by 
the principal, who will say: ‘‘ With the staff at my command, I can teach only 
five subjects of those proposed by the conferences in the manner recommended. My 
school shall therefore be limited to those five.” Larger and richer schools can teach 
more, or perhaps all of the subjects, and then the choice among them will be made 
by the pupil. This choice is necessary, as the committee of ten is careful to point 
out, to thoroughness and to the imparting of power as distinguished from mere infor- 
mation; for any large subject whatever, to yield its training value, must be pursued 
through several years from three to five times a week. 
The committee’s third table is based on the second, but uses four as the standard 
number of weekly periods of study for each subject, except in the first year of a 
new language. Further reference to this table is unnecesgary. 
The fourth table submitted is of great interest, for in it the committee, after 
due deliberation, makes its own selection out of all the material and suggestions 
supplied by the conferences and submits sample standard programmes of secondary 
school work. It would be a grave error to dismiss this question of a specific pro- 
gramme as one involving mere detail that might be left to any principal or superin- 
tendent of schools. The committee of ten itself dissents strongly from that view; 
for it believes that to establish just proportions between the several subjects, or 
groups of allied subjects, itis essential that each principal subject shall be taught ade- 
quately and extensively, and therefore proper provision for it must be made in the 
programme. * * * 
In framing the sample programmes the committee of ten proceeded upon some 
general principles that are of great significance. In the first place, it endeavored to 
postpone to as late a period as possible the grave choice between a classical and what 
is generally known as a Latin-scientific course. Very frequently this choice deter- 
mines a boy’s future career, and it is important that it be made not only late in the 
school course but after excursions into all the principal fields of knowledge have dis- 
covered the boy’s tastes and exhibited his qualities. A second principle is that each 
year of the secondary school course should be, so far as may be, complete in itself, 
and not made wholly dependent on what is to follow. This is essential, because 
thousands of pupils are obliged to leave the high school after one or two years, and 
during that time linguistic, historical, mathematical, and scientific subjects should all 
be presented to them in an adequate manner. Itis alsoimportant that provision be 
made so that each subject may be treated in the same way for all pupils who take it; 
that time enough be given to each subject to gain from it the training it is able to 
give; that the different principal subjects be put upon an approximate equality in 
the matter of time allotment; that all short courses given for purposes of informa- 
“ tion only be excluded; and that the instruction in each of the main lines—namely, 
language, history, science, and mathematics—be continuous. With all of these 
principles in mind, the committee of ten framed the four sample programmes given 
herewith, the names by which they are designated being based on the amount and* 
character of foreign language study in each. 
In adopting twenty as the maximum number of weekly periods of school work, 
the committee had two qualifications in mind: First, that at least five of the twenty 
should be given to unprepared work; secondly, that laboratory subjects should 
have double periods whenever that prolongation is possible. Such subjects as music, 
drawing, and elocution, often found in secondary schools, are purposely omitted from 
the programmes, it being left to local authorities to determine how they shall be 
introduced. 
Inspection will show how carefully the programmes have been framed with refer- 
ence to being carried out economically in a single school. With few exceptions, the
-P-A-G-E-235
  
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1453 
several subjects occur simultancously in at least three of the four programmes, and 
with the same number of weekly periods allotted to them. From a practical point 
of view this is a most important arrangement. Some minor difficulties were caused 
by adhering to the rule laid down by all of the language conferences, namely, that 
two foreign languages should not be begun at the same time, and by limiting the 
course to four years. A six years’ programme would be far easier to construct. 
Critical examination of the committee’s programmes discloses grave defects in the 
most important of all, the classical. It does not provide continuous study in science, 
for that great department is not represented in the third year at all. History is sim- 
ilarly interfered with, and there would also be a break in the mathematical course if 
the option given in the fourth year were exercised in favor of history. The diffi- 
culty lies, I believe, in trying to include history in a four years’ classical course. 
The classics themselves teach history in an admirable way, if the instruction is 
good. A wealth of historical knowledge is grouped about the reading of Cesar, 
Cicero, and Virgil, Xenophon and Homer, the usual secondary school authors; and 
in those which are themselves professedly historical, a great gain would follow 
from a more thorough study of the subject-matter. If history, then, were dropped 
entirely from this programme, a modern language could be begun in the first 
secondary school year, the English course extended in the second year, and no break 
in the science instruction would be necessary. 
Defects in the other programmes exist, but they are not so glaring as those just 
pointed out in the classical. For instance, there is no continuity in the history 
course of the Latin-scientific or modern language programme; and in both of the 
last named there would be a break in the mathematics course also, should the pupil 
exercise his option in favor of history. 
The following table discloses at a glance in what relation the four programmes 
stand to each of the four great divisions of secondary schoolstudy. The figures in the 
several columns represent the total number of weekly periods given during the entire 
four years, in each of the four programmes, to the main subjects. No scheme can 
be called radical that proposes to give 52.5 per cent of allsecondary education what- 
soever to language study, or, adding history, 62.8 per cent to the humanities. That 
this would be the result of following the committee’s recommendations the table 
shows.

This table brings out other interesting facts. It shows how closely allied are the 
Latin-scientific and modern language courses, and how small a part natural science is 
to play in the revised scheme, after all. The one quarter of the whole school time 
that the scientific conferences asked to have given to natural science is not so given 
in any of the programmes, though it is closely approached in three of them. 
Although the report itself contains no reference to European experience or prac- 
tice, it will be interesting to compare the committee’s recommendations with the 
programmes of European secondary schools. Take, for example, the Prussian gym- 
nasium, the tertia and secunda of which nearly correspond to the American sec- 
ondary school years, and the French lycée, where the classes known as cinquitme,

    @ Greek is not eras until the second half of the year. Previous to that time ten hours weekly are given to Latin, b This time is divided between observation lessons on rocks and plants and arithmetic. 
It is seen at once that the German boy is called upon for far more work, measured in 
terms of time, than the American boy; though the difference is not so great as it seems, 
for ‘learning lessons” out of school is not so prominent a feature in German as it is 
in American education. The French boy, under the existing revised programme, 
does about what is to be expected of the American, but his time is differently 
distributed. The French device for preventing “scrappy” courses from becoming 
intolerable is to assign them few but long periods. For example, history, in the 
lycée, is taught but once a week, but that once it occupies an hour and a half con- 
secutively, so that much more is accomplished than in two periods of forty-five min- 
utes each. As arule, the recitation or lesson periods in France are considerably 
longer than those usually found elsewhere, 
In spite of the differences between them, however, it is clear that the proposed 
American classical programme is not very unlike those in vogue on the continent. 
Were the comparison extended to the other programmes—the Latin-scientific, the 
modern language, and the English—a similar relation to the French and German 
programmes of like character would be found to exist. The higher classes of the 
gymnasium and lycée have still a great advantage over the American secondary 
school in the fact that the work leading up to them is carefully organized and devel- 
oped, and may be depended upon, The American grammar school, or better, the 
upper grades of the elementary school, on the contrary, is only here and there effi- 
cient. For two generations the so-called grammar school has conspired with the 
lower or primary grades to retard the intellectual progress of the pupil in the inter- 
est of “thoroughness.” The arithmetic of many puzzles, the formal grammar, and 
the spelling book with its long lists of child-frightening words have been its weap- 
ons. Slowly and with a struggle these are being wrested from it. New knowledge 
is being introduced to illustrate and illuminate the old and higher processes to  
-P-A-G-E-237

  explain and make easier the lower. All this promotes true thoroughness, and also 
allows the child’s mind to grow and develop as nature intended it should, and as it 
often does in spite of the clementary school, not because of it, Therefore, every 
year pupils are reaching tho high school better prepared for its peculiar work; and 
it is not unreasonable to hope thatin ten years the secondary school may assume, in 
the case of its youngest pupils, an ability to use simple English correctly, a knewl- 
edge of the elements of algebra and geometry, and of some epoch or movement in 
history. Perhaps even the study of a foreign language will have been begun. 
From the standpoint of the elementary school, therefore, the committee of ten is 
not unreasonable in its ideal,nor have the conferences proposed anything that is 
impracticable. The same is true when the report is viewed from the standpoint of 
the colleges, though here, too, reform and improvement are necessary, As is well 
known, college admission examinations not only differ widely among themselves, 
but vary from year to year. Perhaps no one of them is too high to admit of a well- 
taught boy entering college at seventeen, but many are so low that the same boy 
ought to pass them successfully at fourteen or even earlier. The colleges haye been 
injuring higher education in America by giving their own idiosyncrasies as to admis- 
sion examination free scope, instead of agreeing together upon a policy. 
I do not mean that the admission examinations of all colleges should be uniform; 
that is not necessary. But, to quote from the report, “it is obviously desirable that 
the colleges and scientific schools should be accessible to all boys or girls who have 
completed creditably the secondary school course.” If the recommendations of the 
committee of ten are carried out—and there is every reason to hope that they will 
be—the “completion of a secondary school course” will have a definite meaning, and 
the colleges can deal with it according’ The graduate of a secondary school will 
haye had four years of strong and effective mental training, no matter which of the 
four school programmes ho has followed, and the college can safely admit him to its 
courses. This single step will bring about the articulation of the colleges and scien- 
tific schools on the one hand with the secondary schools on the other—an articulation 
that has long been recognized as desirable for both classes of institutions and for the 
country. 
The question will naturally arise—it arose in the minds ef the committee of ten— 
Can the improvements suggested be successfully carried out without a very consider- 
able improvement in the training of the teachers who are to de the work? To this 
question but one answer, a negative one,can be given. But,on the other hand, the 
opportunities now available for the higher training of secondary school teachers are 
many times as numerous and as valuable as they were a decade ago. It is trae that 
the hundreds of normal schools are accomplishing very little in this direction, even 
the best of them; but the colleges and universities, where the mass of secondary 
teachers will always be educated and trained, have now awakened to a sense of the 
reponsibility that rests upon them. Harvard and Yale, Columbia and Cornell, Mich- 
igan and Illinois, Colorado and Stanford, and many others have organized special 
deparments for the study of education, and one or two of them are manned and 
equipped more thoroughly than any similar departments in Europe. The effect of 
* this great expansion of activity in the study of education can not fail to be widely 
felt withip the next few years. The colleges have needed, and some of them still 
need, an enlargement of sympathies, as do the normal schools. The colleges have 
focused their attention and energy too largely upon their own special work, and 
have paid no heed to what was going on about and beneath them. The normal 
schools have thought it sufficient to study more or less psychology, and to expound 
more or less dubious ‘‘ methods” of teaching, and have neglected the larger field of 
genuine culture and the relative values of studies. Better apparatus and mere 
teachers will not of themselves lift the college or the normal school out of its rut. 
Only a full appreciation of the relations of these institutions to the work of educa- 
tion as 2 whole can do that. 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  1456 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  And finally, what is the effect of this prolonged and earnest investigation upon 
that ideal of a liberal education that has so long been held in esteem among us? It 
will not have escaped notice that only one of the committee’s four programmes 
makes a place for the study of Greek, while one excludes both Greek and Latin. 
It is true that these are recommended as ideal arrangements, and that it is expressly 
stated in the report to be the unanimous opinion of the committee that, “under 
existing conditions in the United States as to the training of teachers and the pro- 
vision of necessary means of instruction, the two programmes called respectively 
modern languages and English must, in practice, be distinctly inferior to the other 
two.” Nevertheless, it seems clear that the committee has been able to disentangle 
the real from the accidental in our conception of a liberal education, and has put 
the former forward in allits strength. It has not forgotten the precept of Aristotle, 
that ‘there are branches of learning and education which we must study with a view 
to the enjoyment of leisure,” and that ‘these are to be valued for their own sake.” 
“Tt is evident, then,” the philosopher continues, ‘‘that there is a sort of education in 
which parents should train their sons, not as being useful or necessary, but because 
it is liberal and noble. Whether this is of one kind only, or of more than one, and 
if so, what they are and how they are to be imparted, must hereafter be determined.” 
It is just this determination that the committee has made; and it is‘a determination 
that each age, perhaps each generation, must make for itself. Between. a diminu- 
tion of the time given to classical study and a relapse into quasi barbarism there is 
no necessary relation of cause and effect. May not the American say, as did Paulsen 
of his countrymen, that ‘‘idealism generally, if we will use this word of so many 
meanings, is a thing which is not implanted from without, but grows from within, 
and that, in particular, the idealism in the character of the German people has deeper 
roots than the Greek and Latin lessons of our gymnasia?” 
Mr. Lowell’s hope, expressed so eloquently at the Harvard anniversary, will not 
be disappointed by the recognition of a broader basis for human culture. Every 
one may accept the recommendations of the committee of ten and still say with 
him: ‘‘I hope the day may never come when the weightier matters of a language, 
namely, such parts of its literature as have overcome death by reason of their wis- 
dom and the beauty in which it is incarnated, such parts as are universal by reason 
of their civilizing properties, their power to elevate and fortify the mind—I hope 
the day may never come when these are not predominant in the teaching given here. 
Let the humanities be maintained undiminished in their ancient right. Leave in the 
traditional preeminence those arts that were rightly called liberal; those studies that 
kindle the imagination, and through it irradiate the reason; those studies that manu- 
mitted the modern mind; those in which the brains of finest temper have found alike 
their stimulus and their repose, taught by them that the power of intellect is height- 
ened in proportion as it is made gracious by measure and symmetry. Give us sci- 
ence, too, but give first of all, and last of all, the science that ennobles life and makes 
it generous. * * * Many-sidedness of culture makes our vision clearer and keener 
in particulars, For, after all, the noblest definition of science is that breadth and 
impartiality of view which liberates the mind from specialties and enables it to 
organize whatever we learn, so that it becomes real knowledge by being brought 
into true and helpful relation with the rest.” e

  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1457 
- THE CURRICULUM FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS.' 
Wu114M T. Harris, LL. D., United States Commissioner of Education. 
I am to present some considerations on the course of study in secondary schools 
with especial reference to the “report of the committee of ten” recently published. 
What I shall say will be partly in the way of comment on that important report and 
partly in the way of presenting my own solutions of some of the problems to which 
it is addressed. 
In the first place, I would venture the remark that the report of a committee must 
generally beacompromise. The individual views of the several members of the com- 
mittee have been advanced and discussed—in the end they have been so modified 
that a majority can approvethem. It naturally follows that each person signing the 
report accepts it as the nearest approximation to his view that he finds practicable. 
It often happens that in the process of elimination all that is salient and. suggestive 
gets omitted and only the dead level of commonplace ideas is retained. Generally 
it is best to preserve the differences of opinion that remain after all of the discus- 
sions in the committee in the form of minority reports or explicit reservations over 
the signature of the dissenting members. Such dissent helps the outsider to enter 
into the spirit of the discussion and to understand grounds. 
Mere educational authority as such is harmful unless it brings with itits grounds 
which may be studied and mastered, adopted or refuted, by the teacher who reads 
the conclusions set forth. 
In the report of the committee of ten there is an admirable device to preserve 
individual differences and points of view. There are nine reports of special confer- 
ences—each conference being conducted by a subcommittee of ten persons, experts 
in the topic assigned them and representing widely separate parts of the country. 
By letting each group of experts sit by itself and formulate its demands on the 
time of the programme of the secondary school, we were likely to get the utmost 
diversity possible as regards points of view from which secondary studies could be 
considered. Each branch of study would claim what time the members of its con- 
ference thought desirable for its thorough treatment, rather than the time possible 
* to allow it after adjusting its claims in view of all the rest of the programme. 
The able presentation of the scope and significance of the nine branches of sec- 
ondary study by the several conferences affords rich material for study to all inter- 
ested in school work. Butit furnishes a statement of the problem and sets forth the 
difficulties of making a satisfactory programme rather than suggests a solution. 
It was for the committee of ten to digest the results and harmonize the differences 
of the nine subcommittees. 
The first part of the report recites the history of the organization and work of the 
committees and then brings together in Tables I and II the recommendations of the 
several conferences without undertaking any change. Such a programme, as might 
be expected, shows very strongly one thing, namely, the necessity of modifying the 
demands of some or all of the subcommittees for the sake of adjustment. It is a 
reductio ad absurdum., It tells us that if the experts in each of the nine branches 
were to get what they ask we should have 22 recitations per week in the first year 
of the high school, 374 per week in the second year, 35 in the third year, and 37} in 
the fourth year. That is to say, the pupils would hove a daily average of 43 recita- 
tions in the first year, 74 the second year, 7 the third year, and 7} the fourth. If 
each lesson required fifty minutes (taking time for change of classes) the second and 
fourth years would require the pupil to recite continuonsly from 9 in the morning 
to 4.30 in the afternoon, providing for a single intermission of an hour and a quarter 
for lunch in the middle of the day. All the lessons, seven in number, would have 
to be prepared out of school.

1458 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Such a strain on pupils would very soon destroy all elasticity and dhe reaction 
essential to individuality would cease. 
Of course the members of the subcommittees would never for a moment approve 
such a programme. Each set of experts supposed that the demands of the other 
conferences would be modified and adjusted in such a way as to make a reasonable 
programme after allowing their special topic the time required. 
‘The report of the committee of ten proceeds next to show in Table III that the 
demands of the subcommittees can not be made reasonable even by cutting them 
down uniformly 20 per cent and allowing four recitations or lessons a week where 
five lessons are asked for. Even this programme in Table III would demand for the 
second and fourth years an average of 6 lessons per day. 
Up to this point, therefore, the results of the report are negative as far as making 
a programme is concerned. It is with Table IV that the committee of ten first offers 
a programme that it considers practicable. In order to reach this it was necessary » 
to drop the guidance of the subcommittees and commence in earnest the study of 
the comparative educational values of the general branches, and secondly the neces- 
sary order of evolution of said branches and their adaptation to the several stages 
of maturity that the pupil reaches in the secondary school. + 
I would call special attention here to the fact that the committee of ten considered 
first the normal standard for the programme and resolved unanimously that in no 
case should there be more than 20 recitation periods or lessons a week, and only 15 
of these (or 3 per day) should be such as require previous preparation on the part 
of the pupil. This fact makes unreasonable all those attacks on the report which 
condemn it for requiring too much work of the pupil in the secondary school. The 
recommendations of the committee of ten do not err in this respect, for they fall 
safely within the: hygienic limits prescribed in the most cautious and conservative 
schools. = 
Turning to Table IV, which contains this model programme, not compiled from 
the results of the subcommittees, but formed in view of the conflicting necessities 
of hygiene, of preparation for college or the technical school, and of comparative 
educational values—turning to this table we find four programmes, a purely classical, 
a Latin-scientific, a modern language programme, and an English programme. I 
may be believed when I say that the formation of the classical programme con- 
sumed nearly all the time devoted by the committee of ten to discussions. It was 
easy after making the classical programme to omit Greek and substitute more science 
and modern language to form the Latin-scientific programme, and in the third or 
modern language programme to substitute more modern language for Latin. The 
so-called English programme was formed by increasing the time devoted to English 
Janguage and literature and reducing the number of foreign languages studied to 
one, which might be an ancient er a modern language, 
The chief result of the committee’s report, so far as a practical recommendation 
is concerned, therefore, is to be found in the classical programme of Table IV. This 
gives Latin five hours per week during the first and second years, and four hours the - 
third and fourth years. Greek has five hours per week in the third and fourth years 
- and does not appear at all in the first and second. This arrangement makes the sep- 
aration of the pupils who are fitting for college from those who are taking the scien- 
tific or modern language or English programme take place at the beginning of the 
third year, and offers the desirable opportunity for change of mind en the part of 
the secondary pupil after he has completed his second year and begins to see what 
education means. He may defer the question of college until the commencement 
of the third year. 
The mathematical studies are, algebra, four hours a week in the first year and two 
hours a week for half of the third year; geometry, three hours a week second year 
and two hours a week half of the third year; trigonometry and higher algebra, elect- 
ive in the fourth year for three hours a week; English language and literature,    
   
-P-A-G-E-241
  
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1459 
rhetoric, composition and the like studies require four hours a week first year, two 
hours a week second year, three hours the third year, and two hours fourth year. 
The natural sciences are represented by physical geography three hours a week first 
year. This branch includes an elementary view of the organic aspects of nature, 
such as botany, zoology, ethnology, meteorology, geology, and astronomy. The 
other aspect of nature is physics, molar or molecular, called “natural philosophy” 
and “chemistry.” Natural philosophy is.assigned three hours a week second year; 
chemistry three hours a week fourth year. General history has four hours a week 
first year, three hours a week second year, and is elective with trigonometry for 
three hours the fourth‘year. Finally a modern language, French or German, takes 
four hours a week second year and third year and three hours a week fourth year. 
This result seemed to the committee a pretty rich programme after all; it was 
reached only after harmonizing apparently irreconcilable conflicts. It provides for 
Latin, Greek, mathematics, natural science, history, English literature, and modern 
languages. 
Fronr this hasty survey of the report of the committee of ten let me now turn your 
attention,for a moment to the fundamental questions that concern the course of study 
and to the reasons that have made this item in secondary schools the weakest part 
of our school system, although it must be confessed that the teachers in the second- 
ary schools are on the whole more skillful, so far as command of methods is con- 
cerned, than the teachers in the elementary schools or the professors in colleges. 
Let us glance first at the central idea of the elementary school. 
We can deduce the course of study quite easily from the idea of the school as an 
instrumentality designed to connect the child as the new individual with his race, 
and enable him to participate in civilization. 
By education we add to the child’s experience the experience of the human race. 
His own experience is necessarily one-sided and shallow; that of the race is. thou- 
sands of years deep and it is rounded to fullness. Such deep and rounded experience 
is what we call wisdom. . 
To prevent the child from making costly mistakes we give him the benefit of see- 
ing the lives of others. The successes and failures of our fellow-men instruct each 
of us far more than our own experiments. 
The elementary school attempts to give this wisdom in a systematic manner. It 
uses the essential means for its work in the shape of text-books, in which the experi- 
ence of the race is digested and stated in a clear and summary manner, in its several 
departments, so that a child may understand it. He has a teacher to direct his 
studies and instruct him in the proper methods of getting out of bocks the wisdom 
recorded in them. He is taught first in the primary school how to spell out the 
words, and how to write them himself. Above all, he is taught to understand the 
meaning of the words. All first use of words reaches only a few of their many sig- 
nifications. Each word has many meanings and uses, but the child gets at only one 
meaning, and that the simplest and vaguest, when he begins. His school work is 
to train him into accuracy and precision in the interpretation of language. He 
learns gradually to fill each word of the printed page with its proper meaning. He 
learns to criticise the statement§ he reads, and to test them in his own experience 
and by comparison with other records of experience. 
In other’words, the child at school is set to work to enlarge his own puny life by 
the addition of the best results of other lives. There is no other process so well 
adapted to insure a growth in self-respect as the mastery of the thought of the 
thinkers who have stored and systematized the experience of mankind. 
This is the clue to the hopes founded on education. The patriotic citizen sees that 
a government managed by illiterate people is a government of one-sided and shal- 
low experience, and that a government by the educated classes insuresgthe benefits 
of a much wider knowledge of the wise ways of doing things.
-P-A-G-E-242
1460 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
* The work of the school produces self-respect because the pupil makes himself the 
measure of his fellows, and grows to be equal to them spiritually by the mastery of 
their wisdom. Self-respect is the root of the virtues and the active cause of a career 
of growth in power to know and power to do. Webster called the free public schools 
‘a wise and liberal system of police by which property and the peace of society are 
secured.” He explained the effect of the school as exciting ‘a feeling of responsi- 
bility and a sense of character.” 
This, he saw, is the legitimate effect. For as the school causes its pupils to put on 
the forms of thought given them by the teacher and by the books they use; causes 
them to control their personal impulses and to act according to rules and regulations; 
causes them to behave so as to combine with others and get help from all while they 
in turn give help; as the school causes the pupil to put off his selfish promptings 
and to prefer the forms of action based on the consideration of the interests of others— 
it is seen that the entire discipline of the school is ethical. Each youth educatedin 
the school has been submitted to a training in the habit of self-control and of obedi- 
ence to social order. He has become to some extent conscious of two selyes—the 
one his immediate animal impulse and the second his moral sense of conformity to 
the order necessary for the harmonious action of all. . 
Curious scholars have explored and recorded the methods of education of all peo- 
ples; for each people has some way of initiating its youth into the manners and 
customs and intellectual beliefs which constitute the warp and the woof of its civil- 
ization, The bulk of all education is performed by tho family in all ages. The les- 
sons in the care for the person; the conventional forms of eating and drinking; 
behavior toward strangers and toward one’s relations; the mother tongue; the 
stock of beliefs and such habits of scientific observation as may exist in the com- 
munity; the ideals of life; the duties of a citizen; the consciousness of nationality 
and the sentiment of patriotism that depends on it; the elementary arts and trades 
such as exist within the home; all these things are learned within the family. But 
letters and science are usually taught, if taught at all, by a teacher set apart for the 
work, and his department is called the school. 
The school is the auxiliary institution founded for the purpose of reenforcing the 
education of the four fundamentaLinstitutions of civilization. Theseare the family, 
civil society (devoted to providing for the wants of food, clothing, and shelter), the 
state,and thechurch. The characteristic of the school is that it deals with the means 
necessary for the acquirement, preservation, and communication of intelligence— 
the mastery of letters and mathematical symbols; of the technical terms used in 
geography and grammar and the sciences; the conventional meaning of the lines 
used on maps to indicate water, mountains, towns, latitude, longitude, and the like. 
The school devotes itself to instructing the pupil in these dry details of arts that are 
used to record systematic knowledge. These conventionalities once learned, the 
youth has acquired the art of intellectual self-help; he can, of his own effort, open 
the door and enter the treasure house of literature and science. Whatever his fellow- 
men have done and recorded he can now learn by sufficient diligence of his own. 
The difference between the part of education,acquired within the family and that 
acquired in the school is immense, incalculable. The family arts and trades, man- 
ners and customs, habits and beliefs, have formed a sort of close-fitting spiritual 
vesture, a garment of the soul always worn and expressive of the native character, 
not so much ef the individual as of his tribe or family or community. He, the indi- 
vidual, had from birth been shaped into these things as by a mold; all his thinking 
and willing and feeling have been molded into the form or type of humanity looked 
upon as the ideal by his parents and acquaintances. 
This close-fitting garment of habit has given him direction, but not self-direction 
or freedom. He does what he does blindly, from the habit of following custom and 
doing as others do. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1461 
  But the school gives a different sort of training; its discipline is for the freedom 
of the individual. The education of the family is in use and wont, and it trains 
rather than instructs. Its result is unconscious habit and ungrounded prejudice or 
inclination. Its likes and dislikes are not grounded in reason, but are unconscious 
results of early training. But the school lays all its stress on producing a conscious- 
ness of the grounds and reason for things. I should not say all its stress; for the 
school does in fact lay much stress on what is called discipline—on habits of alert 
and critical attention, on regularity and punctuality, on self-control and politeness. 
But the bare mention of these elements of discipline shows that they, too, are of a 
higher order than the habits of the family inasmuch as they all require the exer- 
tion of both will and intellect consciously in order to attain them. The discipline 
of the school forms a sort of conscious superstructure to the unconscious basis of 
habits which have been acquired in the family. 
School instruction, on the other hand, is given to the acquirement of techniques; 
the technique of reading and writing, of mathematics, of grammar, geography, 
history, literature, and science in general. 
One is astonished when he reflects upon it at first to see how much is meant by 
this word technique. All products of human reflection aredefined and preserved by 
words used in a technical sense. The words are taken out of their colloquial sense, 
which is a loose one, except when employed as slang. For slang is a spontaneous 
effort in popular speech to form technical terms. 
The technical or conventional use of signs and symbols enables us to write words 
and to record mathematical calculations; the technical use of words enables us to 
express clearly and definitely the ideas and relations of all science. Outside of tech- 
nique all is vague hearsay. The fancy pours into the words it hears such meanings 
as its feelings prompt. Instead of science there is superstition. 
The school deals with technique in this broad sense of the word. The mastery of 
this technique of reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, and history lifts the pupil 
on to a plane of freedom and self-help hitherto not known to him. He can now by 
his own effort master for himself the wisdom of the race. 5 
By the aid of such instruments as the family education has given him he can not 
master the wisdom of the race but only pick up a few of its results, such as the cus- 
toms of his community preserve. By the process of hearsay and oral inquiry it 
would take the individual a lifetime to acquire what he can get in six months by aid 
of the instruments which the school places in his hands. For the school gives the 
youth the tools of thought. 
Looking for the application of-this technique we see two worlds—nature and 
man. Nature contains, first, abstract or inorganic objects, matter, and motion, to 
which arithmetic, algebra, and higher mathematics relate; then, secondly, it con- 
tains organic objects, like plants, animals, and men. This phase of nature, includ- 
ing vegetable and animal growth and the requisite conditions of climate, land and 
water and air, are treated in geography. 
Hence the child has two studies that give him an insight into nature as the support 
of his life and as the instrument for him to conquer and use in the shape of machin- 
ery, motive powers, food, clothing, and shelter. 
With his first lesson in arithmetic he learns something fundamental about the 
conditions of existence in time and space. Matter and force not merely happen to 
obey mathematical laws, but they have to do so as a primordial necessity of their 
nature. Every lesson in geography from the first is of practical use in giving the 
child command over organic nature. 
Taking the other side of school instruction we find a happy selection of what 
reveals man to himself. Man as an object is body and soul—the body is a physio- 
logical object like animals and plants; the soul is intellect, will, and feeling. The 
child does not study psychology as such, byt something better for him than psychol- 
ogy, for he studies the products of man’s intellect and will and feeling. He
-P-A-G-E-244
1462 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  studies the structure of language in grammar, and this reveals the structure of 
intellect. He studies in literature the revelation of the human heart—its feelings, 
emotions, and aspirations, good and bad. Literature portrays the rise of feelings 
and their conversion into actions and ideas by the will and intellect; it shows the 
collisions of evil feelings with good. History, again, shows the human will in its 
distinctive province, for the will of man is manifest not so much in individual 
adventures as in the formation of states and religious movements and social 
changes. This is collective will, the will of the nation or people, and it is manifest 
in wars or in great social movements, such as colonization, the building of cities, 
internal improvements, commerce, productive industry, ete. 
History reveals man to himself by showing him his deeds. Literature reveals 
man to himself by showing him his character in its process of formation—the ulti- 
mate springs of action as they well up from the unconscious depths of the soul. 
Grammar, philology, and language studies reveal the essential structure of the soul, 
its logical constitution as a self-activity or self-consciousness. 
There are no other phases of nature and man than these five which we sec are con- 
templated by the five chief branches of study in the district schools. 
Secondary education must go on in the same direction, opening windows of the 
soul in five directions so that the pupil gets a better insight into these cardinal 
provinces of nature and man. 
Therefore the secondary pupil will continue his study of mathematics, taking up 
algebra and geometry; of language, studying the ancient languages from which 
civilization has been transmitted, and modern languages. He will continue the 
view of organic nature, given in geography, by studying the outlines and methods 
of such natural sciences as geology, astronomy, physiology, zoology, and botany; 
continue history by adding to the special study of the United States, begun in the 
elementary school, the study of general history; continue the study of literature, 
begun in the school readers, by systematic study of the greatest writers like Shake- 
speare, Milton, Spenser, and Chaucer, in selected complete works of art, together 
with a history of literature. Mathematics are reenforced by physics (called natural 
philosophy) treating of the mathematical laws of solids and fluids. 
To these branches which the ideal course should contain there are certain inci- 
dental studies or arts of a useful character, such as vocal music, bookkeeping, calis- 
thenics, shorthand writing, cooking, woodworking, etc., which are added, some of 
them, to the high school courses of study throughout the country. The modern 
languages taught are usually German and French. The ancient languages are Latin 
and Greek. 
It must be noticed in studying the secondary education of the United States that 
it stands between two other self-regulated systems of schools—the elementary, whose 
eourse is determined by the school committees, and the higher, whose course is deter- 
mined by college faculties and boards of trustees. These two independent directive 
powers do not act in perfect harmony. Hence the secondary school has a twofold 
course of study to provide for—that indicated by the elementary school and that 
required by the college for admission. 
But the public high schools are under the control of the school committees elected 
by the people. This causes them to lay more stress on a continuation of the fivefold 
course of elementary schools than on the studies required for admission to college. 
On the other hand the private secondary schools lay the most stress on preparation 
for college. Here is one of the greatest defects in our system—or lack of system. 
The ideal course of study demands that five windows of the soul be kept open. The 
old preparatory school laid stress on Latin, Greek, and mathematics, neglecting all 
else. These three branches opened only two or three windows (to keep up our sym- 
bolism) ; mathematics gave the key to inorganic nature; Latin and Greek answered 
to grammar and literature, chiefly to grammar or the logical side of the soul, with a 
little touch of history and literature on the sides of the will and sensibility, Nature
-P-A-G-E-245
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1463 
  was left out of sight, except as mathematics gave the general conditions of all 
nature—the structure of time and space. 
The private secondary school, therefore, in the last generation slighted history, 
modern literature, natural science, and sociology. The publie high school undertook 
to develop these important sides of a rounded education and succeeded in a measure. 
But it was obliged to adopt another course of study for its pupils fitting for college. 
Hence there arose a general or English course, and a classical course. 
I have compared the classical course of study to a palm tree which first builds a 
tall stem and then suddenly expands into foliage at the top. So the preparatory 
school and the college required six years (four in the preparatory and two in col- 
lege) to be devoted almost exclusively to Latin, Greek, and mathematics, and then in 
the last two years of the college made a hasty survey of nature and modern. litera- 
ture and history, as a sort of finishing touch. 
There is no doubt that the high school course laid out by the school committees is 
more rational than the secondary course of the private preparatory schools, pre- 
scribed for them by the colleges.. And yet the college course was the conscious 
product of the highest educated minds of the community. The unconscions evolu- 
tion by ‘natural selection” in the minds of school committees elected by the people 
was wiser on the whole. Individual members of city school boards are always 
found who oppose classical studies altogether. But the pressure of popular demand 
always prevails to secure in the public schools what is needed. 
The difficulty in this case is that the high school pupil taking up all the five 
branches—mathematics, natural science, history, modern literature, Latin and Greek— 
in his four years, is not so far advanced in the classic languages as the special pre- 
paratory school, and does not compete with it on anequal footing. Special classical 
courses in the public high school are a costly experiment wherever carried on. 
This produces what we may call a national disaster in our education, namely, the 
discouragement of pupils in high schools from taking up higher education. The 
public high schools, in proportion to their enrollment, send comparatively few to 
the colleges. 
The disadvantages of this to the nation are great, for higher education even with 
a ‘‘palm-tree” course of study educates the majority of the real leaders of society. 
It might be supposed, that those best versed in natural science would have this-pres- 
tige, and doubtless natural science counts for much. But the classically educated 
man has advantages over all others. That this should be so may be seen by a brief 
consideration of the rationale of its course of study. 
We have secn that there are needed five windows in the soul to see the five classes of 
objects in nature and humanity. Natural science relates chiefly to the organic and 
inorganic phases of nature but gives little insight intohuman nature. On the other 
hand language study, and especially literature, leads direetly toward this knowl- 
edge of man that is essential to large directive power. = 
As to the dead languages, Latin and Greek, they are the tongues spoken by the two 
people who invented the two threads united in our modern civilization. The study 
of Greek puts one into the atmosphere of art, literature, and science, in which the 
people of Athens lived. This is the effect of Greek literature; it is also the effect of 
the mere language in its idioms and in its grammatical structure. 
The study of Latin puts one similarly into the stern, self-sacrificing, political atmos- 
phere of Rome. The Romans invented laws for the protection of life and private 
property, and also the forms of combination into corporations and city governments. 
To study Latin makes the pupil more attentive to, and conscious of, the side ef his 
civilization that deals with combinations of men into social organizations. 
No other ancient or modern language gives us anything of equal value for gaining 
an insight into the institutions under which we live, except the study of the Bible. 
The Hebrew thread of our civilization is still more important, because while the 
Roman secures civil freedom, and the Greek intellectual freedom and artistic taste, 
   
-P-A-G-E-246
1464 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the Hebrew oracles give us the revelation of the personality of God, the fountain of 
allfreedom. For unless the absolute is a free personality, man’s freedom must be 
all a temporary and abnormal affair; the iron fate which pantheism sees as the first 
principle will get the advantage after all. 
We may see that the colleges ought to continue to lay chief stress on Latin, Greek, 
and mathematics as the studies that foster directive power, but they ought to add 
also the three moderns, natural science, modern literature, and history, incorporating 
them into the course throughout, so that the oak rather than the palm tree becomes 
the symbol of the curriculum, 
By ‘‘directive power” is meant the influence that molds the actions of men. This 
may be exercised not only by the military, political, or the industrial leader, but by 
the lone scholar who publishes great discoveries to the world; by the editors of 
periodicals, by the orators, preachers, and teachers, and especially by the poets and 
literary men. 
‘There has been a process of adjustment going on in higher education in several 
directions, especially since 1870. First, an elevation of the standard of admission 
took place, chiefly brought about by the action of Harvard College. Secondly, an 
éxtension of the scope of elective studies as a consequence of the raised standard 
which now brought the freshmen class nearly up to where the junior class had been. 
Thirdly, the requirements for admission began to be more varied and to require some- 
thing of English literature and a modern language, with some natural science and 
history; but much more Latin and Greek. 
Had the Latin and Greek requirements remained the same, the new standard of 
admission would have fitted the course of study of the public high school, and the 
problem would have been solved. As 1 is now, the situation of the high school as a 
feeder for the college is worse than before 1870. Then the classical requirements for 
graduation at the high school would admit the students to college, while the collat- 
eral branches of history, science, and English literature that he had begun in the 
high school gave him greater apperceptive power, or greater ability to grasp the 
practical application of what he had learned. 
Is it not a mistake that higher education has made in trying to lengthen the school 
life of youth by increasing the length of the secondary school course? Is it not far 
better to take the student into college at 16 or 18 years of age, and after the course 
of study that leads him to see the unity of human learning take him into a post- 
graduate course that teaches him how to specialize and pursue lines of original 
investigation in the laboratory or seminary? 
This radical question is now in a fair way to be answered rationally; for this 
report of the committee of ten will lead to such investigations of the educational 
value of secondary branches and methods of instruction as will put us in possession 
of accurate knowledge in regard to the nature and limits of elementary, secondary, 
and higher education. We shall learn the fitting age for each and not, as heretofore, 
esteem it an advantage to hold back the pupil as long as possible in the elementary 
and secondary courses under plea of securing greater thoroughness. We shall 
understand that the elementary methods are of necessity too mechanical to be used 
to advantage beyond the fourteenth year, while the secondary methods consist too 
much of copying styles and classic forms, in aping modes of work and habits of 
thinking, to be continued to advantage beyond the eighteenth year. We shall know 
better than we do now what is fitting for each age and period. With this we shall 
enter on a new and more scientific epoch of educational theory and practice.

THE UNITY OF EDUCATIONAL REFORM.' 
By Cuartes W. Exior, President of Harvard University. 
The report of the committee of ten has now been in the hands of the teachers of 
the country for about six months, so that there has been time to formulate and pub- 
lish some criticism and objections. I propose to comment in this paper on one criti- 
cism or objection which in various forms and by several different persons has been 
brought before the educational public. Whenever I speak of the report I intend to 
include the reports of the conferences as well as the proper report of the committee 
of ten, for the chief value of the total report lies in the conference reports. 
_ The objection to the report which I shall discuss is contained in the question, 
“What do college men know about schools?” Those who urge this objection sayin 
substance, “ More than half the members of the conferences were at the moment in 
the service of colleges and universities, and the same was true of the committee of 
ten. The wise management of schools for children of from 6 to 18 years of age is a 
different business from the wise management of colleges and universities. Not only 
is the age of the pupils different, but their mode of life and the discipline they need 
are also different. The mental capacity of young children is low compared with 
that of college students; their wills are weaker, and their moral qualities unde- 
veloped. How can men who teach and govern young people from 18 to 24 years of 
age know anything about schools for children? Let them attend to the higher edu- 
cation and not attempt to teach experts in elementary and secondary education how 
to conduct their very different business. That a man has succeeded in conductinga 
college or a university makes it altogether probable that his advice will be worthless 
as to the best mode of conducting a school or a system of schools. We school super- 
intendents and principals have to handle masses of average material; your college 
and university teacher has only a small number of exceptional individuals to deal 
with.” 
To meet this objection I wish to affirm and illustrate the proposition that the chief 
principles and objects of modern educational reform are quite the same from begin- 
ning to end of that long course of education which extends from the fifth or sixth 
to the twenty-fifth or twenty-sixth year of life. The phrase ‘ educational construc- 
tion” would perhaps bo better than the phrase “educational reform ;” for in our day 
and country we are really constructing all the methods of universal democratic 
education. We seldom realize how very recent and novel an undertaking this edu- 
cational construction is, Asa force in the world universal education does not go 
behind this century in any land. It does not go back more than twenty years in 
such a civilized country as France. It dates from 1871 in England. Plato main- 
tained that the producing or industrial classes needed no education; and it is hardly 
more than a hundred years since this Platonic doctrine began to be seriously ques- 
tioned by social philosophers. It is not true yet that education is universal even in 
our own land; and in all lands educational practice lags far behind educational 
theory. In this process of educational construction, so new, so strange, so hopeful, 
I believe that the chief principles and objects are the same from the kindergarten 
through the university, and therefore I maintain that school teachers ought to 
understand and sympathize with university reform and progress, and that college 
and university teachers ought to comprehend and aid school reform and progress. 
Let us review together those chief principles and objects, although in so doing I 
shali necessarily repeat some things I have often said before. 
I. The first of these objects is the promotion of individual instruction—that is, the 
addressing of instruction to the individual pupil rather than to groups or classes. 
At present the kindergarten and the university best illustrate the progress of this

  1466 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
reform; but the beneficent tendency is clearly exhibited all along the line. In ele- 
mentary and secondary schools the effort is constantly made to diminish the number 
of pupils assigned to one teacher; and in some fortunate secondary schools the pro- 
portion of pupils to teachers has already been intentionally made as favorable as it 
has incidentally become in the most prosperous universities which have been adding 
rapidly to their advanced courses of instruction. In urban school systems the num- 
ber of pupils assigned to a teacher is recognized as the fundamental fact which 
_ determines better than any other single fact the quality and rank of each system 
among those with which it may be properly compared. Into the curricula of schools 
and colleges alike certain new matters have of late years been introduced for teach- 
ing which the older methods of instruction—namely, the lecture and the recitation— 
proved to be inadequate or even totally inapplicable. These new matters are chiefly 
object lessons in color and form, drawing and modeling, natural sciences like bot- 
any, zoology, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, and geology, and various kinds of 
manual training. In school and college alike the really effective teaching in all 
these subjects is that which is addressed to each individual pupil. All laboratory 
and machine-shop teaching has this character, no matter what the subject. The 
old-fashioned method of teaching science by means of illustrated books and demon- 
strative lectures has been superseded from the kindergarten through the university 
by the laboratory method, in which each pupil, no matter whether he be 3 years old 
or 23, works with his own hands and is taught to use his own senses. General 
explanations and directions may be given a class; but in the laboratory each individ- 
ual’s work must be separately supervised and criticised. There is nothing more 
individual than a laboratory notebook. In all laboratory and machine-shop work 
the rates of progress of different pupils vary widely. Quicker eyes, defter hands, 
greater zeal, and better judgment will tell, and the teacher has every opportunity to 
discover the natural gifts or defects of the different pupils and to develop the pecul- 
iar capacity of each mind. All the artistic subjects, as well as all the scientific, 
require individual instruction. In drawing, painting, and modeling the instruction 
is, of necessity, individualized. It is one of the best results of the introduction of 
manual training that each pupil must receive individual criticism and guidance. 
The instructor is compelled to deal with each pupil by himself and to carry each 
forward at his own rate of speed. In short, manual training breaks up class-room 
routine and introduces diversity of achievement in place of uniform attainment. I 
say that this principle applics all the way from the kindergarten to the professional 
school. It applies conspicuously in medical instruction; and within twenty-five 
years it has been there applied so successfully that it is no exaggeration to say that 
within this period the whole method of teaching medicine has been revolutionized 
throughout the United States. It isnow universally recognized that it is impossible 
to teach medicine and surgery to large numbers of persons simultaneously by gen- 
eral descriptions, or by the use of diagrams, pictures, or lantern slides which many 
cansce at once. Not that illustrated lectures and general demonstrations are wholly 
useless; but they hold only a subordinate place. The really important thing is 
individual personal instruction under circumstances which permit the student to see 
and touch for himself, and then to make -his own record and draw his own infer- 
ences. Finally, the highest type of university teaching—the so-called seminary or 
conference method—is emphatically individual instruction. 
It is hard to say at what stage of education from the primary grade to the final 
university grade the individualization of instruction is most important. The truth 
is that the principle applies with equal force all along the line. For the university 
president, the school superintendent, and the kindergartner alike it should be the 
steady aim and the central principle of educational policy; and whoever under- 
stands the principle and its applications at any one grade understands them for all 
grades.

SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1467 
  IL Secondly, let me ask your attention to six essential constituents of all worthy 
education—constituents which in my opinion make part of the educational process 
from first to last, in every year and at every stage—and let me ask you particularly 
to consider which of these constituents belong to schools but not to colleges, or to 
colleges, but not to schools, 
The first constituent is the careful training of the organs of sense, through which 
we get incessant and infinitely diversified communications with the external world, 
including in that phrase the whole inanimate and animate creation with all human 
monuments and records. Through the gate of accurate observation come all kinds 
of knowledge and experience. The little child must learn to see with precision the 
forms of letters, to hear exactly the sounds of words and phrases, and by touch to 
discriminate between wet and dry, hot and cold, smooth and rough. The organs of 
sense are not for scientific uses chiefly; all ordinary knowledge for practical pur- 
poses comes through them, and language, too, with all which language implies and 
renders possible. Then comes practice in grouping and comparing different sensa- 
tions or contacts, and in drawing inferences from such comparisons—practice which 
is indispensable in every field of knowledge. Next comes training in making a rec- 
ord of the observation, the comparison, or the grouping. This record may obviously 
be made either in the memory or in written form; but practice in making accurate 
records there must be in all effective education. Fourthly comes training of the 
memory, or, in other words, practice in holding in the mind the records of observa- 
tions, groupings, and comparisons. Fifthly comes training in the power of expres- 
sion—in clear, concise exposition, and in argument or the logical setting forth of a 
process of reasoning. This training in the logical development of a reasoning pro- + 
cess is almest the consummation of education; but there is one other essential con- 
stituent, namely, the steady inculeation of those supreme ideals through which the 
human race is uplifted and ennobled—the ideas of beauty, honor, duty, and love. 
These six I believe to be essential constituents of education in the highest sense. 
We must learn to see straight and clear; to compare and infer; to make an accurate 
record; to remember; to express our thought with precision; and to hold fast lofty 
ideals. The processes I have described as separate often take place in the mind so 
rapidly that they, or some of them, seem to us simultaneous. Thus, intelligent 
conversation involves observation, comparison, record, memory, and expression, all 
ina flash. But if these be constituents of education, is not education a continuous 
process of one nature from beginning to end? Are not these six constituents to bo 
simultaneously and continuously developed from earliest childhood to maturity? 
The child of 5 years should begin to think clearly and justly, and he should begin 
to know what love and duty mean; and the mature man of 25 should still be train- 
ing his powers of observing, comparing, recording, and expressing. The aims and 
the fundamental methods at all stages of education should therefore be essentially 
the same; because the essential constituents of education are the same at all stages. 
-The grammar school pupil is trying to do the same kinds of things which the high 
school pupil is trying to do, though, of course, with less developed powers. The 
high school pupil has the same intellectual needs which the university student 
feels. The development of a mind may be compared with the development of a 
plant—it proceeds simultaneously and continuously through all its parts without 
break or convulsion. If at any stage there seems to be a sudden leafing or blooming, 
the suddenness is only apparent. TLeaf and bloom had long been prepared—both 
were enfolded in last year’s bud. From first to last, it is the teacher’s more impor- 
tant function to make the pupil think accurately and express his thought with pre- 
cision and force; and in this respect the function of the primary school teacher is 
not different in essence from that of the teacher of law, medicine, theology, or 
engineering. 
III. A considerable change in the methods of education has been determined dur- 
ing the past twenty-five years by the general recognition of the principle that effect-
-P-A-G-E-250
    1468 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ive power in action is the true end of education, rather than the storing up of 
information or the cultivation of faculties which are mainly receptive, discrimi- 
nating, or critical. We are no longer content in either school or college with impart- 
ing » variety of useful and ornamental information, or with cultivating xsthetic 
taste or critical faculty in literature or art. We are not content with simply 
increasing our pupils’ capacity for intellectual or sentimental enjoyment. All these 
good things we seek, to be sure; but they are no longer our main ends. The main 
object of education, nowadays, is to give the pupil the power of himself doing an 
endless variety of things which, uneducated, he could not do. An education which 
does not produce in the pupil the power of applying theory or putting acquisitions 
into practice, and of personally using for productive ends his disciplined faculties, 
is an education which has missed its main end. One humble illustration of the 
influence of this principle is the wide adoption of reading foreign languages at 
sight as a suitable test of fitness for admission to colleges. Another similar illus- 
tration is the use of question papers in geometry containing a large proportion of 
problems which do not appear in explicit form in the ordinary manuals, but which 
can be answered or solved by making a simple application of the geometrical prin- 
ciples developed in those manuals. These are tests of acquired power. We think 
it reasonable to test a student of chemistry by giving him an unknown substance 
to analyze. Can he find out what it is and prove his discovery correct? In other 
words, can he apply his information and knowledge of methods to a problem which 
is to him wholly unknown? Has he acquired not only information, but power? 
The whole field of natural science is available for that kind of training in power 
getting which it is the main object of modern education to supply. It is not what 
the student of medicine has heard about, or seen others do, but what he can do him- 
self with his own eyes and hands and with his own powers of comparing and 
judging, which will give him preeminence as a physician or surgeon. To give per- 
sonal power in action under responsibility is the prime object of all medical educa- 
tion. This same principle, however, applies just as well in the primary school as in 
the professional school. Education should be power getting all the time from the 
beginning to the end of its course. Its fundamental purpose is to produce a mental 
and moral fiber which can carry weight, bear strain, and endure the hardest kinds 
of labor. 
IY. The next educational principle which I believe to apply to two-thirds of the 
entire educational course between 5 and 25 years of age is the principle of the selec- 
tion or election of studies. In the first three or four years cf a child’s education— 
say from 5 or 6 years of age to 9 years—there are not so many possible subjects of 
equal value and necessity but that the child may pursue them all to some adequate 
extent; but by the ninth or tenth year of age more subjects will claim the child’s 
attention than he will have time for, thereupon arises the uecessity for a selection of 
studies. As the child advances from the elementary school to the secondary school, 
and from the secondary school to the college, the number and variety of subjects 
from which to choose will rapidly increase, until in the department of arts and 
sciences of the university he will find that he can not attempt to follow the twen- 
tieth part of the instruction offered him. Table I and II, in the report of the. com- 
mittee of ten, demonstrate abundantly the absolute necessity for selection or 
election of studies in secondary schools, and even in the later years of the elemen- 
tary course. Who shall make the selection, is really the only practical question. 
The moment we adopt the maxim that no subject shall be attacked at all, unless it 
is to be pursued far enough to get from it the training it is fib to supply, we make 
the election or selection of studies a necessity. This principle has now been adopted 
by all colleges and universities worthy of the name, and by the greater part of the 
leading high schools, academies, endowed schools, and private schools; but in these 
secondary institutions the principle is commonly applied rather to groups of sub- 
jects than to single subjects. The result is an imperfect application of the elective  
-P-A-G-E-251
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1469 
  principle, but it is much better than any single uniform prescribed course. Finally, 
this principle has within a few years penetrated the grades, or the grammar schools, 
and has earned its way to a frank recognition at that stage of education. 
It is no objection to the principle, and it establishes no significant distinction 
between college experience and school experience, that there must obviously be 
limitations of diversity in studies during school life. School programmes should 
always contain fair representations of the four main divisions of knowledge—lan- 
guage, history, natural science, and mathematics—but this does not mean that every 
child up to 14 must study the same things in the same proportions and to the same 
extent. On the contrary, representation of the different kinds of knowledge and 
mental action having been secured, the utmost possible provision should be made 
for the different tastes, capacities, and rates of progress of different children. More- 
over, a main object in securing this representation of language, history, science, and 
mathematics in the earlier years of education is to give the teacher opportunity to 
discover each pupil’s capacities and powers. There is, however, no ground of dis- 
tinction between school teaching and university teaching in respect to these special 
limitations; for if we turn to the very last stage of education—professional train- 
ing—we find there a serious limitation on the principle of election, a limitation 
imposed by the necessity of giving all young lawyers, physicians, ministers, teach- 
ers, engineers, biologists, or chemists the considerable quantity of strictly profes- 
sional information and practice which every future member of theso several pro- 
fessions absolutely needs. Again, for the same reason, scientific or technological 
schools must for the present use a group system rather than a free election of studies. 
They must adjust their present instruction to current professional needs. The 
freest field for the principle of seltction or election of studies lies between the ages 
of 13 and 23, including five or six years of school life and all of college life. School 
men and college men alike should rejoice in this free field. 
V. The next rule of educational reform, which applies at every stage of the long 
course of education that civilized society provides, relates to what is called disci- 
pline. Down to times quite within my memory the method of discipline both in 
school and college was extremely simple, for it relied chiefly, first, on a highly 
stimulated emulation, and secondly, on the fear of penalty. It had not been clearly 
perceived that an immediate, incessant, and intense emulation does not tend to 
develop independent strength of will and character, good in either solitude or 
society, and that fear of penaliy should be the last resort in education. Itisnowan 
accepted doctrine that the discipline of childhood should not be so different from 
tkat of adolescence as to cause at any point of the way a full stop and a fresh start. 
A method of discipline which must be inevitably abandoned as the child grows up 
was not the most expedient method at the earlier age; for the reason that in educa- 
tion the development and training of motives should be consecutive and progressive, 
not broken and disjointed. Herein lies one of the objections to whipping, or other 
violence to the body, and to all methods which rely on the fear of pain or of artificial 
penalties or deprivations. There comes an age when these methods are no longer 
applicable. At18 there are no methods of discipline analogous to whipping, or to 
the deprivation of butter, sweetmeats, supper or recreation, or to the imposition of 
verses to learn, or of pages of Latin or English to copy. If this sort of motive has 
been relied on up to 18, there will then be need of a whole new set of motives. For 
these reasons among others the judicious teacher, like the judicious parent, will not 
rely in childhood, if he can help it, on a set of motives which he knows must inevit- 
ably cease to operate long before the period of education is ended. By preference, 
permanent motives should be relied on from beginning to end of education, and this 
for the simple reason that the formation of habits is a great part of education, and 
in that formation of habits is inextricably involved the play of those recurrent emo- 
tions, sentiments, and passions which lead to habitual volitions, Among the per- 
manent motives which act all through life are prudence, caution, emulation, love of 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  1470 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
approbation, and particularly the approbation of persons respected or beloved, shame, 
pride, self-respect, pleasure in discovery, activity, or achievement, delight in beauty, 
strength, grace, and grandeur, and the love of power and of possessions as giving 
power. Any of these motives may be overdeveloped; but in moderation they are 
all good, and they are available from infancy to old age. 
From the primary school through the university the same motives should always 
be in play for the determination of the regulation of conduct. Naturally they will 
“grow stronger and stronger as the whole nature of the child expands and his habits 
become more and more firmly fixed; and for this reason these same enduring motives 
should be continuously relied on. Obviously, then, there is no difference between 
men who manage colleges and men who manage schools in relation to this impor- 
tant principle of educationalreform. The methods of both should be identical; and 
the college man or the school man who does not guide and govern through the rea- 
son of his pupils, through their natural interest in observation, experiment, com- 
parison, and argument, and through the permanent motives which lead to right 
conduct, isnot in sympathy with one of the most humane and hopeful edneational 
reforms of the present generation. All teachers who deserve the name now recog- 
nize that self-control is the ultimate moral object of training in youth—a self-con- 
trol independent of temporary artificial restraints, exclusions, or pressures, as also 
of the physical presence of a dominating person. To cultivate in the young this 
self-control should be the steady object of parents and teachers all the way from 
babyhood to full maturity. 
VI. The next principle of educational construction to which I invite your atten- 
tion is again one which applies throughout the length and breadth of education. 
It is the specialization of teaching. One might easily imagine that this principle 
had already been sufficiently applied in universities, and only needed to be applied 
hereafter in schools, but the fact is that the specialization of instruction is still 
going on in universities, and needs a much greater extension in American colleges 
and professional schools than it has yet received. Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes was 
professor of anatomy and physiology in Harvard University down to 1871, and he 
really taught, in addition to these two immense subjects, portions of histology and 
pathology. He described himself as occupying not a chair, but a settee. The pro- 
fessorship in Harvard University which was successively occupied by George Tick- 
nor, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and James Russell Lowell, is the Smith pro- 
fessorship of the French and Spanish languages and literatures. In many American 
colleges we find to-day the same professor teaching logic, metaphysics, ethics, and 
political economy. Indeed, this was the case in Harvard College down to 1871, 
except that moral philosophy and Christian ethics were detached from the Alford 
professorship from and after 1860. The specialization of instruction is by no means 
completed in American colleges. Itis better advanced now in American secondary 
schools than it was in the American colleges eighty years ago, and itis just begin- 
ning to be developed in the American grammar schools, or grades, where it is gen- 
erally spoken of as departmental organization. From the extension of this principle 
in American schools much is to be hoped within the next ten years, particularly for 
the teacher. To teach one subject to pupils at different stages, adapting the instruc- 
tion to their different ages and capacities, watching their development, and leading 
them on with due regard to individual differences through four or five years of con- 
tinuous progress, gives an inexhaustible interest to the teacher’s function. To mas- 
ter one subject so as to be able to give both elementary and advanced instruction in. 
it, is for the teacher himself a deep source of intellectual enthusiasm and growth. 
Real scholarship becomes possible for him, and also a progressive intellectual expan- 
sion through life; for only progressive scholars can maintain for many years the 
mastery of even a single subject. Does it seem to you an unreasonable expectation 
that teachers in the grades, or grammar schools, should possess the mastery of single 
subjects? Careful observation seems to me to give assurance that exceptional
-P-A-G-E-253
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1471 
  teachers, both men and women, already possess this mastery, and that what remains 
to be done is to make the exceptions the rule. Toward effecting this greatimprove- 
ment two important measures are the elevation of normal schools and the creation or 
strengthening of educational departments in colleges and universities. Atany rate, 
there can be no doubt that this specialization of instruction is a common need from 
beginning to end of any national system of instruction, and that is capable of add- 
ing indefinitely to the dignity, pleasure, and serviceableness of the teacher's life. 
Obviously this common need and aspiration shonld unite rather than divide the 
various grades of education, and should induce cooperation rather than cause dis- 
sension. 
VIL. There is a fundamental policy in regard to educational organization which 
should unite in its support all teachers, whether in schools or universities—the 
policy, namely, that administrative officers in educational organizations should be 
experts, and not amateurs or emigrants from other professions, and that teachers 
should have large advisory functions in the administration of both schools and 
universities. The American colleges and universities are better organized in this 
respect than the American schools. More and more, the heads of the institutions of 
higher education are men of experience in education itself or in other administrative 
services. The presidencies of colleges are no longer filled, as a rule, by withdrawing 
from the ministry men well advanced in life and without experience in teaching. 
The deans of the rather distinct schools which compose universities are usually men 
of experience in their several departments; and much power is exercised by the 
faculties of colleges and universities, these faculties being always bodies composed 
of the more permanent teachers. Moreover, in large colleges and universities all 
the teachers of a given subject are often organized into a body called a division or 
department, with a chairman chosen from among them as a judicious man and a dis- 
tinguished teacher, These or similar dispositions need to be adopted throughout 
the large urban school systems. Superintendents should be educational experts of 
proved capacity. Their assistants, whether called supervisors, inspectors, or assistant 
superintendents, should be organized as a council or faculty, and all the teachers of 
a single system should be associated together in such a way that by their represent- 
ativés they can bring their opinions to bear on the superintendent and. his council, 
or in the last resort on the committee or board which has the supreme control of the 
system. The teachers of the same subject should also be organized for purposes of 
mutual consultation and support, and at their head should be placed the best teacher 
of the subject in the whole system, that his influence may be felt throughout the sys- 
tem in the teaching of that subject. Moreover, the colleges and the schools need to 
be assimilated in respect to the tenure of office of teachers. After suitable proba- 
tionary periods, the tenure of office for every teacher should be during good behavior 
ané efficiency. 
In general, the differences of organization between colleges on the one hand and 
school systems on the other are steadily growing slighter. The endowed schools and 
academies already have an organization which closely resembles that of the colleges, 
and ail the recent changes in the mode of conducting urban school systems tend in 
the good direction I have described. There is in some quarters a disposition to. 
dwell upon the size of public school systems 2s compared with the size of colleges 
and universities; but size is no measure of complexity. A university is indefinitely 
more complex than tho largest city school system, and the technical methods of uni- 
versity management are more various and intricate than tho technical methods of 
any school system. Independently of all questions of size or mass, however, admin- 
istrative reform is taking the same directions in both colleges and schools—first, 
toward expert control under constitutional limitations; secondly, toward stable 
tenures of office; and thirdly, toward larger official influence for teachers. 
Recalling, now, the main heads which have been treated, namely, the individuali- 
zation of instruction, the six essential constituents of education, power in action as
-P-A-G-E-254
  1472 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the true end of education, the selection or election of studies, the appeal to perma- 
nent instead of temporary motives for controlling conduct, the specialization of 
teaching, and the right principles of educational organization, do we not see that 
the principles and methods of educational reform and construction have a common 
“ interest for all teachers, whether connected with colleges, secondary schools, or ele- 
mentary schools, and shall we not agree that there is something unphilosophical in 
the attempt to prejudice teachers of whatever grade against the recommendations of 
the committee of ten and of the conferences that committee organized, on the grounds 
that a small majority of the persons concerned in making them were connected with 
colleges, and that the opinion of college or university officers about school matters 
are of little value? 
The plain fact is that there is community of interests and aims among teachers 
throughout all the grades into which the course of education is at present artifieally 
divided. The identity of the principles which govern reforms and improvements at 
every stage is strikingly illustrated by the simultaneousness and similarity of the 
advances now being everywhere made. Elementary schools, secondary schools, and 
colleges all feel similar impulses, and are all making similar modifications of their 
former methods. I can testify from personal observation that some of the adminis- 
trative improvements lately made in universities resemble strikingly improvements 
made at the other extremity—namely, in the kindergartens. It is very noticeable 
that even some of the mechanical or business changes made in school administra- 
tion—changes which were not supposed to have any bearing on the philosophy of 
education, or on new methods of teaching—haye facilitated true educational reform. 
Thus, the method of transporting children at public expense to central grammar 
schools in a rural town, or to high schools in large towns and cities, has distinctly 
facilitated the introduction of departmental and elective instruction. Again, the 
purchase and free issue of books for pupils by towns and cities has facilitated the 
use of good literature instead of readers—an important contribution toward improv- 
ing the teaching of the native language and literature by increasing interest in them 
and love for them. In like manner, the institution of departmental libraries—that 
is, of small working collections of books on the same general subject, deposited in 
a place by themselves, and always accessible to students of that subject—has made 
possible great improvements in the instruction of Harvard College and many other 
colleges. 
The committee of ten declare in their report ‘that it is impossible to make a satis- 
factory secondary school programme, limited to a period of four years, and founded 
on the present elementary school subjects and methods.” In view of the rapid 
changes now going on in elementary school subjects and methods, this declaration 
amounts to saying that the committee’s work on the four secondary school pro- 
grammes they recommend has only a temporary interest. Tables I, II, and III of 
their report have some permanent value; but Table IV, which contains the four 
programmes called classical, Latin-scientific, modern languages, and English, and 
which’ cost the committee a great deal of labor, will surely be rendered useless by 
improvements in the elementary and secondary schools which may easily be accom- 
plished within ten years. Some firm, lasting principies are embodied in Table IV, 
but the programmes themselves are only temporary trestlework. 
If I were asked to mention the best part of the contribution which the committee 
of ten have made to the progress of American education, I should say that their gen- 
eral method of work was the best part—the method of investigation and discussion 
by subject of instruction teachers and experts from all sorts of colleges and univer- 
sities and from all sorts of schools, public, private, and endowed, taking part in 
both investigation and discussion. The committee’s method of work emphasizes the 
community of interest at all grades, and the fact that experience at every grade is 
valuable for suggestion and counsel at all other grades. Tomy thinking, the pres- 
ent artificial and arbitrary distinctions between elementary schools and secondary  
-P-A-G-E-255
  
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1473 
schools, or between grammar schools and high schools, have no philosopnical founda- 
tion, and are likely to be profoundly modified, if they do not altogether pass away. 
In the same sense, I believe that the formal distinction between college work and 
university work is likely to disappear, although the distinction between liberal edu- 
cation and technical or professional education is sure tv endure. I have never yet 
seen in any college or university a method of instruction which was too good for an 
elesnentary or asecondary school. The alert, inspiring, winning, commanding teacher 
is just the same rare and admirable person in school and in college. There is, to be 
sure, one important element of university work which schools and colleges can not 
participate in—namely, the element of original investigation—but although this 
element is of high importance, and qualifies, or flavors, a considerable part of uni- 
versity work, there remains in all large universities, and particularly in those which 
make much of professional training, an immense body of purely disciplinary work, 
all of which is, or should be, conducted on principles and by methods which apply 
throughout the whole course of education. When it is a question how best to teach 
a given subject, the chances are that college or scientific school teachers of that 
subject can help school teachers, and that school teachers can help college teachers. 
Moreover, it is important that each should know what the other does. I have 
observed, too, that, even when neither party is ready to venture on affirmative coun- 
sel, each is pretty well prepared to tell the other what not to do. Such negative 
counsel is often very useful. 
On the whole, the greatest promise of usefulness which I see in the report of the 
committee of ten lies in its obvious tendency to promote cooperation among school 
and college teachers and all other persons intelligently interested in education, for 
the advancement of well-marked and comprehensive educational reforms. 
  REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF TEN. 
By James H. Baker, President of the University of Colorado. 
HISTORY. 
Ina report on requirements for admission to college, made to the National Coancil 
of Education in 1891, the following recommendation appeared: 
“That a committee be appointed by this council to select a dozen universities and 
colleges and a dozen high and preparatory schools to be represented in a convention 
to consider the problems of secondary and higher education.” 
In accordance with the recommendation the committee making the report, of which 
the writer was chairman, was authorized to call a meeting of representatives of lead- 
ing educational institutions at Saratoga in 1892. Invitations were issued and some 
30 delegates responded. After a three days’ session a plan was formulated which was 
adopted by the National Council. The committee of ten thus appointed and charged 
with the duty of conducting an investigation of secondary school studies held its 
first meeting in New York City in November, 1893. The committee arranged for nine 
subcommittees or conferences, each to consider a principal subject of high school 
courses, and submitted to them definite inquiries. Each conference was composed of 
prominent instructors in the particular subject assigned. The inquiries covered such 
points as place of beginning the study, time to be given, selection of topics, advisa- 
bility of difference in treatment for pupils going to college and for those who finish 
with the high school, methods, etc. The reports of these conferences in printed 
form, together with a summary of the recommendations, were in the hands of the 
committee of ten at their second meeting in New York, November, 1893. The report 
of the committee of ten, including the conference reports, through the good offices of 
the Commissioner of Education, was published by the Government, and it has now 
been before the country for some months.

GENERAL COMMENTS. 
The manner of investigation took a somewhat different turn from what was antici- 
pated when the original report, which led to the undertaking, was made, but I do 
not doubt the wisdom of the plan finally adopted. The committee is confident that 
it would be difficult to find groups of men in America better fitted than the members 
of the conferences to discuss the specific subjects assigned them, and their recom- 
mendations as to cheice of matter, the time element, place in the curriculum, and 
the best methods constitute a most valuable contribution to the educational litera- 
ture of the period. In the main they represent the best thought of practical edu- 
cators. It is not my purpose to enter into a discussion of the details of these 
‘conference reports. Each report, and in many instances each part of the report, is in 
itself a large theme. The summary of results and the recommendation of the com- 
mittee of ten will occupy the time allotted me. 
It was expected that the report as a whole would excite much discussion and invite 
extensive criticism; and if no other result is attained than the sharpening of wits 
in controversy, the existence of the report has sufficient warrant. 
It is impossible to say of any opinions that they are final and of any methods that 
they are the best. Some hold that the eternal verities are to be discovered in the 
consciousness of the few geniuses, and that obtaining a consensus of opinion is not 
the way to reach wise conclusions. If we are Hegelian in our philosophy of his- 
tory, we shall hold to the law of development, shall believe that each stage of 
thought is a necessary one, that the best light is obtained by the historie method, 
and that the highest evolution of thought is to be found in the belief and practice 
of the advanced representatives of any line of investigation. The work of the con- 
ferences was to correlate the parts of each subject by the method of applying reason 
to history; it was the work of the committee proper to correlate these results by the 
same method. Whether the committee was large and varied enough to represent all 
sides is to be decided by the discussions of those best fitted to form opinions. 
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. 
After a careful review of the work of our committee I venture to make a formal 
list of opinions presented, mest of which I think should be heartily indorsed, reserv- 
ing till later the discussion of a few of them. 
(1) That work in many secondary school studies should be begun earlier. 
(2) That each subject should be made to help every other, as, for example, history 
should contribute to the study of English, and natural history should be correlated 
with language, drawing, literature, and geography. 
(3) That every subject should be taught in the same way, whether in preparation 
for college or as part of a finishing course. 
(4) That more highly trained teachers are needed, especially for subjects.that are 
receiving increased attention, as the various sciences and history. 
(5) That in all scientific subjects laboratory work should be extended and 
improved. 
(6) That for some studies special instructors should be employed to guide the work 
of teachers in elementary and secondary schools. 
(7) That all pupils should pursue a given subject in the same way and to the same 
extent as long as they study it at all. 
(8) That every study should be made a serious subject of instruction, and should 
cultivate the pupil’s powers of observation, memory, expression, and reasoning. 
(9) That the choice between the classical course and the Latin-scientific course 
should be postponed as long as possible, until the taste and power of the pupil have 
been tested and he has been able to determine his future aim. 
(10) That twenty periods per week should be adopted as the standard, providing 
that five of these periods be given to unprepared work.

  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. “1475 
(11) That parallel programmes should be identical in as many of their parts.as 
possible. 
(42) That drawing should be largely employed in connection with most of the 
studies. : 
(13) The omission of industrial and commercial subjects. This is mentioned 
without comment. 
(14) That more fieldwork should be required for certain sciences. 
(15) The desirability of uniformity ; not definitely recommended in the report. 
(16) That the function of the high schools‘should be to prepare for the duties of 
life as well as ‘to fit for college. 
(17) That colleges and scientific scheols should accept any one of the courses of 
study as preparation for admission. 
(18) That 2 good course in English should be required of all pupils entering 
college. 
(19) That many teachers should employ various means for better preparation, such 
as summer schools, special courses of instruction given by college professors, and 
instruction of school superintendents, principals of high schools, er specially 
equipped teachers. 
(20) That'the colieges should take a larger interest in secondary and elementary 
schools. 
(21) That technological and professional ‘schools should require for admission.a 
complete secondary school education. 
(22) That-each study pursued should be given continuous time adequate to secur- 
ing from it good results. 
The points of the report which I should question areas follows: 
(1) That Latin should be begun much earlier than now. (This is 2 conference 
recommendation. ) 
(2) That English should be given as much time as Latin. (Conference recom- 
mendation.) 
(3) The large number of science subjects recommended, with loss of adequate 
time for-cach. 
(4) Theomission of 2 careful analysis of the value of each subject, absolute and 
relative, preparatory to :tabulating courses. 
(5) The apparent implication that the multiplying of courses is advisable. 
(6) The implications that the choice of subjeets by the pupils may be a matter of 
comparative indifference—the doctrine of equivalence of studies. 
(7) Some parts of the: model programmes made by the committee. 
BEGINNING CERTAIN STUDIES 
  EARLIER. 
An examination of tabulated results of the investigations of the conferences will 
show that in their opinion the following studies should be begun below the high 
school: 5 
English literature. 
German or French. 
Elementary algebra and concrete geometry. 
Natural phenomena. 
Natural history. 
Biography and mythology, civil government, and Greek and Roman history. 
Physical geography. 
There has been much discussion within a few years as to improvements in ele- 
mentary courses of study, with, I believe, a growing tendency toward important 
modifications. Rigid and mechanical methods and an exaggerated notion of thor- 
oughness in every detail have often become a hindrance to the progress of the pupils 
in elementary schools. The mind of the child is susceptible of a more mature 
development at the age of 14 than is usually attained. There are numerous exam-  
-P-A-G-E-258
  1476. EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ples of pupils in graded schools, who, with very limited schoo. terms, prepare 
for the high school at the age of 14. Under the guidance of painstaking and intel- 
ligent parents or private tutors, children cover in avery brief time the studies of the 
grammar school. All have noted, under favoring conditions, a surprising develop- 
ment at an carly age in understanding of history, literature, and common phenom- 
ena, a growth far beyond that reached at the same age in the schools. These facts 
simply show the possibilities of the period of elementary education. We understand 
that ultimately those best prepared to judge must determine the modifications, if 
any are needed, of the elementary courses. Some say the courses arv already over- 
crowded, it is impossible to add anything. Is it not true, however, that by placing 
less stress upon a few things, by arousing mental activity through the stimulus of 
the scientific method, and by improving the skill of the teachers, the work suggested 
by these conferences may be easily accomplished? All these experiments are already 
old in many schools in the country. 
Consider the logical order of studies. Each child, almost from the dawn of 
consciousness, recognizes relations of number and space, observes phenomena, and 
draws crude inferences, records in his mind the daily deeds of his associates, and 
employs language to express his thought, often with large use of imagination. 
Already has begun the spontaneous development in mathematics, science, history, 
and literature. Nature points the way and we should follow the direction. These 
subjects in their various forms should be pursued from the first. Hill’s True Order 
ot Studies shows that there are some five parallel, upward-running lines represent- 
_ ing the divisions of knowledge, and that development may be compared to the 
encircling onward movement of a spiral which at each turn cuts off a portion of all 
the lines. If we accept this view, we must grant that geometry on its concrete side 
belongs to the cartiest period of education; that the observation of natural phe- 
nomena with simple inferences will be a most attractive study to the child; that the 
importance of observation of objects of natural history is foreshadowed by the spon- 
taneous interest taken in them before the school period; that tales of ancient heroes, 
and the pleasing myths of antiquity, together with the striking characters and 
incidents of Greek and Roman history, belong to the early period of historic knowl- 
edge; that the whole world of substance and phenomena that constitutes our envi- 
ronment should be the subject of study under the head of physiography or physical 
geography; that the thoughts of literature, ethical and imaginative, appeal readily 
to the child’s mind. We may add that the taste of children may be early cultivated 
and that the glory which the child discovers in nature makes possible the art idea 
and the religious sentiment. The reason for beginning a fore: language early 
is somewhat independent, but all agree that early study of a living language is 
desirable. 
Should we not reconsider our analysis of the elementary courses? Superintend- 
ents and teachers will find the necessary changes not impossible, but easy. The sum 
of all that is recommended for the elementary schvols by the conferences is not so 
formidable as at first appears. 
    IDENTITY OF INSTRUCTION. 
The relation of the mind to a study is determined by the nature of the mind and 
the nature of the study, and there seems to be no reason in psychology why a 
college preparatory subject should be taught differently to one fitting for the duties 
of life. Besides, it is economy to make identical the work of different courses as 
far as possible. There was perfect unanimity in the opinion that the same studies 
should be pursued by all in the same way as far as taken. 
BETTER TEACHERS. 
Everyone knows that many teachers are unskilled to present in the elementary 
schools the beginnings of geometry, science, history, or literature, and that the fail- 
ures in this work are due to the mechanical efforts of those who have had no higher 
   
-P-A-G-E-259
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1477 
‘or special training. The demands of present methods are imperative for improved 
power in instruction. Science is well taught in but a few schools. I have seen 
within a few months a school which taught biology from a manual without speci- 
men, microscope, or illustrations. It was a humiliating confession of the committee 
that the classical course is superior, for the reason that it is difficult to find enough 
instructors competent to teach modern subjects by modern methods. 
POSTPONING CHOICE OF COURSES, 
A very important principle recognized by the committee 1s the advantage of 
postponing the necessity of making a final choice of courses as long as possible. In 
this country we have no fixed conditions of rank,and the poor man’s son has the 
same privileges as the sons of men of position and wealth. Hence, the station in 
life is not determined by the differentiation in courses at an early period. Very few 
parents decide upon the final character of the children’s instruction much before the 
beginning of the college period. 
For these reasons I would not agree with the conference recommendation to begin 
Latin at an earlier period. It would not be cconomy; there is enough else that 
belongs to the elementary stage of education, and I would not recommend a plan 
that is founded upon the foreign view of caste and fixed condition in life. 
UNIFORMITY. 
  Uniformity in requirements for admission to college was the subject of the report 
that finally led to this investigation. Although uniformity is not prominently urged 
in the report of the committee of ten, I think that the logical outcome of the latter 
report will be a tendency toward uniformity. There is a vigorous conflict of opinion 
to-day as to nationalism and individualism, with a strong tendency, especially in 
education, toward individualism. In my judgment there exists a harmful slavery of 
the high and preparatory schools to the erratic and varied demands of different col- 
leges, and also a slavery to ignorance and caprice in some schools themselves, which 
would be removed by a general agreement to uniformity. Men aro not enslaved, 
but are emancipated, by organization, and freedom of the individual is found in the 
good order of society and government. In a facetious criticism of the committee’s 
report by a man with whom I have had many a friendly tilt, I read the following. 
The writer is arguing for extreme individualism in choice of studies: “Please tell 
us if you and your colleagues on the conference considered any methods for the 
encouragement of cranks.” No; for the encouragement neither of cranks nor of 
crankiness, but for the encouragement of the best kind of rational education. While 
there are afew wise, independent investigators who need no enforced uniformity 
and will not be bound by the recommendations of others, nine-tenths of the schools 
are largely imitators, or, worse, are working independently with limited insigbt, and 
this nine-tenths would be vastly improved by adopting courses and methods grow- 
ing from a consensus of the best opinions of the country. The lowest would thereby 
tend to rise to the highest and from that plane a new advance could be made. Mean- 
time the original thinkers would be free to push forward toward higher results to 
be generally adopted later. Through contact of various ideas some principles are 
settled, and the world is free to move on toward fresh discovery. 
The selection of studies is to be determined largely by the nature of the mind and 
the universal character of natural and civil environments, and this fact points toward, 
the possibility of uniformity. The period of secondary education is not the period 
' for specializing, and even if it is there should be some uniformity in differentiation. 
In the United States there is a general uniformity of tradition of government, of 
civilization, and the educated youth of San Francisco bears about the same relation 
to the world as the educated youth of Boston; hence, so far as elementary and sec- 
ondary education is pursued, there is no reason why it should not be substantially 
the same in various schools, not in details belonging to the individual teacher, but 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  
  1478 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
in paper requirements and important features of methods. This is an argument for 
the general adoption of such recommended courses as shall be the final outcome, 
after free discussion of the investigations of these conferences and of the committee. 
CONNECTION BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES, 
Nothing in the whole report is more important than the proposed closer con- 
nection between high schools and colleges, and this is clearly and forcibly urged. 
Whatever course of study properly belongs to a secondary school is also a good 
" preparation for higher education, else either secondary or higher education is 
seriously in error. Whenever a youth decides to take a college course, he should 
find himself on the road toward it. No one can doubt that in the coming years pupils 
from properly arranged high school courses must be admitted to corresponding 
courses in higher education. The divorcement between higher education and all 
lower grade work, except the classical, has been a fatal defect in the past. The 
entire course of education should be a practical interest of college professors, and 
there should be a hearty cooperation between them and school superintendents and 
principals in considering all educational problems. 
STANDARD OF PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
It is a fact of significance that a committee on which some leading institutions 
are represented urges the professional schools of the country to place their standard 
of admission as high as that of the colleges; and we hope that aid will thus be given 
the institutions endeavoring to raise the prevailing low requirements of law, med- 
ical, and divinity schools. 
The reports of most of the conferences asked for continuous and adequate work 
for each subject, that it might become a source of discipline and of valuable insight. 
No doubt part of the work in high schools is too brief and fragmentary to gain from 
it the best results, and I regret that the committee report did not more clearly pre- 
sent this defect. 
In fact, I believe the aim should be to reduce the number of courses, the number 
of subjects, and the number of topics under a subject. It is not necessary that the 
entire landscape be studied in all its parts and details if a thorough knowledge of 
the most prominent features is gained. 
CHOICE OF SUBJECTS. 
In one important point I was constrained to differ from the reading of the report, 
as finally submitted, although the expressions to which exceptions were taken were 
due rather to the standpoint of the writer of the report than the resolutions of the 
committee. I refer to those paragraphs in which it is implied that the choice of 
studies in secondary schools may be a matter of comparative indifference, provided 
good training is obtained from the subjects chosen. This view makes education 
formal without giving due regard to the content. Here are the world of nature and 
the world of mind. Nature, when its meaning is realized, has the same meaning for 
all, and in its various phases affects all in substantially the same way, The history 
of mankind in its various kinds and degrees of development has the same content 
for all. The nature of mind in generic characteristics and the universal truths that 
belong to the spiritual world are the same for all. Mind has the same powers in all 
human beings. We all know, feel, and will; all persons acquire through attention; 
retain in memory under the same conditions; obey the same laws of association; 
reason, so far as rightly, from the same principles; act from motives. Men may be 
. classed crudely according to the motives that will appeal to them. While there are 
jnfinite variations in details of men’s natures, in power of insight, degree of develop- 
ment, methods of acquisition, predominant motives, in interests and tendencies, all 
persons in their growth obey the laws of human nature. Hence I argue thata 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1479 
science of education is possible; that it is possible to select studies with a view to 
their universal use in the primary development of the powers and with the assur- 
ance of superior value as revealing to man his entire environment and the nature of 
his being. 
Mere form, mere power, without content, means nothing. Power is power through 
knowledge. The very world in which we are to use our power is the world which 
we must first understand in order to use it. The present is understood not by the 
power to read history but by what history contains. The laws of nature and deduc- 
tions therefrom are not made available by mere power, but by the power which 
comes from the knowledge of them. Hence the education which does not include 
something of all views of the world and of the thinking subject is lacking in data 
for the wise and effective use of power. 
ANALYSIS OF STUDIES. 
In viéw of this position I would regard it the duty of the committee to analyze 
carefully the nature and importance of each leading subject representing a part of ~ 
the field of knowledge, to the end that a wise correlation of the work of the confer- 
ences might bemade. The study of number in its concrete form and in its abstract 
relations, the study of space relations as-founded upon axiomatic truths, are neces- 
sary asa basis of many kinds of knowledge, as representing an essential view of the 
world, as a foundation for the possibilities of commerce and structures, and as fur- 
nishing important training in exact reasoning. Science includes many things; but 
chemistry and physics, which explain the manifestations of force in the material 
world; biology, which reveals important laws of plant and animal life, and physi- 
ography, which acquaints us with our entire environment as to location, phenomena, 
and partial explanation—these are connected with the practical side of civilization 
and the welfare of humanity, and are a guard against superstition and error. They 
are indispensable for practice in induction, and they should be well represented ina 
course of study. History, in which man discovers the meaning of the present and 
gains wisdom for the future, which is a potent source of ethical thought, must not 
be omitted, English language, as the means of accurate, vigorous, and beautiful 
expression, and English literature, which is the treasury of much of the world’s 
best thought, are not subjects to leave to the election of the pupil. 
In addition to the training in observation, memory, expression, and inductive rea- 
soning which most studies offer, we must consider the development of imagination, 
right emotion, and right will. In other words, wsthetic and ethical training is most 
essential. Secondary schools need not employ formal courses of study to this end, 
but various means may be employed incidentally. There are a hundred ways in 
which taste may be cultivated, and literature is one of the best means for develop- 
ing the art idea. Moral character is developed by right habit, by the right use of 
the powers in the process of education, by growth in knowledge of ethical princi- 
ples, by growth of the spirit of reverence, and by the ethical code of religion. All 
of these means, except the formal use of the last, may be employed by the schools. 
And the ethical element is inherent in the very nature of right education. To edu- 
cate rightly is to educate ethically. History, biography, and literature make direct 
contributions to ethical knowledge. 
We now reach the study of foreign classical tongues. If there is nothing more 
than formal training, for instance, in Latin, the sooner we abandon its study the 
better. But we find in it also a valuable content. In the process of development 
some phases of human possibility seem to have been aimost fully realized, while the 
world has continued to develop along other lines. In such cases we must go back 
and fill our minds with the concepts that belong to the remote period. The insight 
into the character of the peoples and their institutions, the concepts of their civiliza- 
tions, the beauty of their literatures, the practical contribution to the knowledge of 
our own language, form an important content to be realized by the study of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  1480 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  
Greek and Latin classics. From the foreign modern tongues German may be chosen 
because of its valuable literature, its contributions to science, its dignity, and its 
relation to the Anglo-Saxon element of our own language. 
We have endeavored to show that the choice of studies is not a matter of indif- 
ference, that mathematics, science, history, the English language and literature, 
foreign language, and art and ethics all belong to the period of secondary education, 
and we have tried to Suggest the inference that all should be employed. The rela- 
tive importance of each can not be exactly measured, but experience and reason 
must guide us.   
ORGANIZATION OF COURSE 
  Granting that these are the subjects to be used in making secondary school pro- 
grammes, we must consider the time element the most difficult problem of all. But 
we must grapple with it calmly and firmly, as did each of the conferences in their 
recommendations, and correlate, in the light of history and reason, the data given 
by the conferenve. We must grant the possibility of certain differentiations at 
somo points in the high school courses. For instance, pupils choosing the classical 
course must depart in a measure from the normal modern programme, 
I have placed at the end of this discussion for comparison tables which group 
subjects under the four heads named in the analysis—mathematies, science, history 
and English, and foreign language. 
Table of subjects as assigned by the committee.—The first table shows, classified, the 
nine divisions of subjects, as assigned to the nine conferences, respectively. 
Table showing recommendations of the conferences.—The second table shows the 
recommendations of the conferences classified in the same way as above. Since 
the conferences worked separately this table shows at almost every point need 
of adjustment. For the first year an aggregrate of 22 periods per week is recom- 
mended, for the second 37}, for the third 35, for the fourth 87}. The programme 
maker must either choose a few subjects, omitting other essential ones, or must 
adjust the time and order relations of the table. ‘The latter appears to be the 
preferable alternative. 
r Table showing proposed arrangement of courses.—I would base the whole subject of 
programme making upon the relations of the child to the world of knowledge; 
would make mathematics, science, history, and literature the foundation, and pro- 
vide for the foreign languages by additions or by modification and substitution, I 
would adopt the present standard for mathematics, and would limit‘the number of 
sciences recommended by the conferences. Arranging for convenieuce the studies 
in four parallel lines, under the heads of mathematics, science, history and English, 
and foreign language, I would give to history and English the time of one of the 
four divisions. English is the native tongue and is already familiar, and English 
literature will be read voluntarily through life if the taste for it and the power to 
understand it are acquired in the schools. History, if the right method of study be 
imparted and the interest be cultivated, will also be pursued voluntarily. We may 
allow for Latin about the usual time, and in the classical course we may substitute 
Greek for some of the sciences and mathematics. In case an additional foreign 
Janguage is taken it must be an extra, or the time of each line of work must be 
shortened or further substitutions must be made as wisely as possible. 
The table showing the proposed arrangement of courses is not worked out in detail. 
It suggests that approximately one-fourth of the time be given to each column; 
that in other courses than the classical, if a second foreign language be taken, it 
should be regarded as an extraif possible; that Greek, if taken, be substituted for 
the science of the last two years and the mathematics of the last year, This com- 
bines simplicity of plan, identity of instruction in the same subject for all courses, 
and continuous and adequate work with the necessary differentiation.

Tables showing the courses as arranged by the committee, the subjects being reclassified 
for comparison.—In view of this discussion I would offer the following criticisms of 
the four model courses presented by the committee: 
(1} While there is much to be said in favor of the courses as they stand, I think 
they lack more or less in simplicity of arrangement, in proper classification, in pro- 
portion, in continuity and adequateness of time for some of the subjects, in economy 
to aslight degree, and in failure to properly limit the number of studies. 
(2) Taking 80 as the aggregate number for each of the four courses the propor- 
tionate number of each group is as follows:

Except in the English conrse, foreign language appears to have more than its just 
proportion, and history and English claim a very large share in the course with one 
foreign language. 
(3) Itis doubtful whether higher algebra belongs to a high school course, although 
it is inserted in my own scheme. 
(4) The scheme for science violates the principle so strongly urged of adequate 
time for each subject. Too many science subjects are inserted. It is better to pur- 
sue four sciences, each one year, than to take twice the number with half a year for 
each. If we select as the most important high school sciences, for instance, physical 
geography, physics, chemistry, and biology, we shall see that the committee have 
added (1) botany or zoology, (2) astronomy, (3) meteorology, (4) geology or physiog- 
raphy, (5) physiology. In the second and fourth years two sciences are presented 
side by side. Moreover, physics, the generic science, is given only three hours, no 
more than is given botany or zoology. 
(5) In two of the courses besides the classical no history appears in the second and 
fourth years, except as an option in the fourth. 
(6) Since in small high schools pupils in all courses should be taught the same 
subject in one class, there appears to be a mistake in that in a few instances divisions 
are made necessary. S 
FINAL STATEMENT. 
  The criticisms of the report of the committee of ten which I wonld emphasize most 
are these: The lack of a bold and clear analysis of the value of subjects before corre- 
Jating the recommendations of the conferences; the implications that the committee 
favored an extreme theory of equivalence of studies; practical details in the organi- 
zation of the model courses, 
Ido not know how far other members of the committee may agree with me in any 
of these adverse views, nor what stand may be taken by the council, and I feel a 
diffidence in taking exceptions to any parts of results the most of which can but be 
heartily approved. If the committee consent and the council wish it, it would seem 
very desirable that these points be given further consideration. It would be easy 
to obtain by correspondence the views uf a few of the most intelligent programme 
makers in the country, and the committee could hold another meeting at some con- | 
venient time. We must remember that a large percentage of the schools will look 
chiefly at the practical and forma] results of the investigation, hence the importance 
to be attached to the model courses. May I add that the recommendations of the 
conferences to introduce certain subjects in the elementary school period are worthy 
of the most careful and extended consideration at no remote date by a competent 
committee.

In closing I wish to express my most hearty appreciation of the work done by 
the other members of the committee, and especially by the chairman, who took the 
greater share of the burden as well as faith in the general results which should 
be but the beginning of a much needed work in this country.

1484 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
THE REPORT OF THE CONFERENCE ON ENGLISH.! 
By A. F. NIGHTINGALE, 
  Superintendent of high schools, Chicago. 
The committee of ten, clothed with the authority of the National Educational 
Association to appoint nine other committees of ten each, men of the largest expe- 
rience and the widest repute, who should consult concerning the application of 
proper remedies to cure the evils which make the secondary schools (God save the 
mark!) ‘the most defective part of the education of this country,” have published 
their report. 
No such educational movement, whether considered in the light of its conception 
or in the light of its denouement, was ever before attempted. 
The report is by far the best contribution to educational theory of the century, 
whether we consider the range of subjects discussed, the exhaustive treatment of 
each, the high character, scholarly ability, and rich and varied experience of the 
contributors, or the widely divergent opinions to which the report has given rise 
among the rank and file of those who are largely responsible for this ‘ most defec- 
tive part of our education.” 
The committee was nationally appointed for a national purpose, and it was fair to 
presume that the results of their deliberations were pubiished for no other reason 
than to receive the commendation, the criticism, or the condemnation of the free- 
thinking, individual-minded educators of this country. 
We have been surprised therefore to note the attempts in the ‘I am holier than 
thou spirit” to smother freedom of speech and freedom of opinion on the dogmatic 
statements and wise suggestions of this great educational pronunciamento, Per- 
-sonally I have had no words but those of exalted praise for this marvelous report, 
issued with such marvelous unanimity in such a marvelously short time, but there 
are those who, out of theirlarge experience and with the independence of the Amer- 
ican spirit, have dared to place some strictures upon the conclusions reached. They 
are men whose experience entitles them to be heard with candor, whose opinions I 
respect, and whose judgment on educational matters, if I disagreed, would lead me 
to review my own. 
I protest, therefore, in the name of untrammeled opinion against the anathema 
maranatha which has been pronounced upon them, and against the dictum of Holy 
Writ, slightly changed, which has been used to silence adverse opinions, ‘‘ For I 
testify unto every man that readeth the words of this book, if any man shall add 
unto these things [tke committee] shall add unto him the plagues that are written in 
~ this book.” 
Wendell Phillips once said, ‘‘If the Alps, piled in cold andstill sublimity, be the 
emblem of despotism, then the ever-restless ocean is ours, which, girt within the 
eternal laws of gravitation, is pure only because never still.” So it seems to me that 
the far-reaching and long-abiding benefits of this report are to be secured, not from 
an idolatrous adoption of its every tenet, but through the ceaseless agitation in 
every educational circle of the ideas propounded, so that out of the revolution that 
has been inaugurated may come reformation, progress, advancement. Less than one 
hundred years ago a young girl in Hatfield, Mass., was in the habit of going to the 
schoolhouse and sitting on the doorstep, that she might listen to the recitations of 
the boys in a building across whose threshold no girl might cross as a pupil. Less 
than four score years ago Emma Willard, of sainted memory, gave the first examina- 
tion in this country to a young lady in geometry, and about the same time she intro- 
duced into her little school in Middlebury, Vt., the study of physiology, and so 
great was the innovation, that at the examination the eptire audience, shocked at 
the indelicacy of teaching such a subject to girls, rose and left the room, and they 
were not Christian scientists either. These instances with which our own fathers

SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1485 
  and mothers were conversant seem strange to us now, and I refer to them only 
to show that, notwithstanding all the defects of our present educational system, its 
puerile methods and its meager results, there has been constant improvement, not 
ouly in the classes reached, but in the matter taught and in the methods used since - 
1792, when a Massachusetts town was indicted for voting ‘‘ not be at any expense for 
schoolimg girls.” 
It is with this optimistic spirit that I approach the discussion of this much ana- 
lyzed subject of English. 
At the very outset I am pleased to state that it is my conviction that the highest 
interests of our schools would be subserved if, without a plus or a minus, and with- 
out a single attempt at exegesis, this most admirable and most exhaustive report of 
the conference on English could be adopted and placed on trial as the “ne plus 
ultra” of matter and method in the instruction of the English language and of 
English literature in all our primary and secondary schools. 
I do not agree, in my possible ignorance and stupidity, with all the propositions 
of all the conferences as set forth in this educational encyclical, but I am in hearty 
accord with this superb report of the conference on English, which is so largely per- 
meated with the empirical thought of that teaching genius, Dr. Samuel Thurber, 
- who by his ponderous strokes upon the anvil of everlasting truth has aroused on 
this subject the white heat of enthusiasm. His ideas may seem somewhat Utopian 
when we stand face to face with the heterogeneous elements of our cosmopolitan 
schools, but it is only through this looking up and lifting up spirit that we can ever 
approach those ideals which shall find all our children in a condition of intelligent 
homogeneity. : 
It is not my province to discuss the recommendations of the conference relative to 
elementary schools; but “if,” quoting from the report, “during the period of life when 
-imitation is the chief motive principle in education,” the child could “be kept away 
from the influence of bad models and under the influence of good models,” and if 
“every thought which he expresses would be used as a proper subject for criticism 
as to language,” all of which is practically impossible amid such a lamentable lack 
of language culture among the common school teachers of to-day, then indeed would 
there be little to change or criticise in our secondary schools, and our colleges would 
be a veritable “Paradise Regained” for the professors of literature. 
It is the process of undoing what has been poorly done, and doing what has been 
left undone that dissipates the strength, shocks the sensibilities, and destroys the 
nerves of our secondary teachers, most of whom are the products of the wisdom of 
the colleges. 
When the radical reforms now being attempted shall have culminated in perfecting 
the what and the how in our lower schools, then shall we make axiomatic the maxim 
that the beginning is half the end. 
Taking exceptions to the briefand summary way in which the committee discard 
the spelling book, which we beheve to be still a spell of power and of might in all 
schools where the foreign element largely predominates, we commend this portion 
of the report as a New Testament on the teaching of English. 
I do not echo the universal opinion of all competent to judge in maintaining that 
Janguage is or ought to be the basic study in all our schools. It isthe fountain head 
whence flow all the helpful, healing streams of education. Language is the key 
that unlocks all human thought and gives voice to all human aspirations. To think 
well, to speak well, to write well—these are the rightful heritage, the common pre- 
rogative of all whoare correctly educated. 
Words are ammunition in the battery of intelligence, steam in the engines of 
thought, true coin in the exchange marts of scholastic culture. A man without 
words is like a beautiful ship launched upon the welcome bosom of the sea without a 
pilot. There is no substitute for language. It isthe common carrier of all thought, 
the drawn sword of all strife, and the one language that American pupils should

1486 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  ‘study through all their career is the English language. Courses of instruction, 
however, that confine language study to the English, eliminating foreign tongues, 
ancient or modern, ignominiously fail in the production of that power -essential to 
modern culture. 
Iwould have children at the.age of 10 or 11 years commence the study of that lan- 
guage which, in the fields of persuasion and philosophy, of literature and law, is so 
largely the progenitor of the English—the incomparable Latin. This is the inter- 
national arsenal out of which men in all ages have taken the-weapons of words with 
which they have fought the battles of all genuine culture. Latin is the Carbonifer- 
ous age in its relation to modern thought. We heat our firesides now by the con- 
sumed and:adapted sunlight of Paleozoic times, so the light of modern literature and 
law comes from the intellectual sunlight that warmed the souls of the great masters 
of Greece and Rome. Side by side in daily study the two languages should be pur- 
sued, the Latin constantly iiluminating the English, and making the study of our 
native tongue more and more a delight, therefore more and more fascinating, :and as 
an inevitable sequence more and more profitable. 
It-can not ‘be controverted that Latin, as some:one has recently written, is the most 
valuable and loyal handmaid in securing that accurate and discriminating use of 
the English language which is the sign and seal of the educated and the cultured. 
I therefore deprecate the force-and fervor of that movement, now gathering strength, 
which would permit some modern language to usurp the place which rightly be- 
longs to Latin, and for which there is no adequate-alternative. 
In large cities, for political and purely utilitarian reasons, German may be suf- 
fered as an elective, but to introduce French as a culture study into our grammar 
schools, to accompany that of the English to the exclusion of Latin, will work mis- 
chief and defeat the very ends for which we-all labor, viz, a fluent and facile use of 
the English language as an instrument for the expression of thought by our pupils. 
The controversial histery of the last two-decades in regard to humane studies has 
established the fact that there is no-substitute for classical culture. I still believe 
in the Cape Horn route of culture, not in the short cut, the miasmatic way across 
the Isthmus. 
If we would-be strong, we must -contend with something—resist something—con- 
quer something. We can not gain muscle “‘on a bed of ciderdown.” Toying with 
straws will only enervate the faculties. The blacksmith’s arm becomes mighty 
through his ponderous strokes of the hammer upon the anvil. The very facility of 
acquisition of the modern languages precludes the possibility of discipline. 
Put Latin into our common schools and the puzzling problem of English grammar 
will be nearing its-solution, for the why that meets the pupil at-every step, the very 
laborionsness and difficulty of the task, will open the intellect, develop the powers 
of discrimination and adaptation, enlarge the vocabulary, enable the student ‘to 
write a better English essay, use a more terse and trenchant style of speech, and 
grasp with more avidity and keenness any promulgated form of thought than if he 
should spend quintuple the time in the study of English grammar alone. 
It is true that the English conference, as President Eliot says, “intend that the 
study of English shall be in all respects as serious and informing as the study of 
Latin,” but they did not: commit the error of saying that it should ‘be as serious and 
informing as the study of French. 
Permitting me to digress a moment, I have always believed until recently that the 
course of study in our high schools:should be the same, whether the pupil’s immediate 
outlook was the activities of life or a college course; that a good preparation for 
college was the best preparation for any alternative; but the demand on the part of 
some of the leading colleges that pupils must enter with an elementary knowledge 
of three foreign languages will foreyer prevent this desideratum:on the part of our 
high schools,
-P-A-G-E-269
  
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1487 
Pupils can not afford to devote so large a portion of their time to foreign languages 
at tho risk of not going to college; but substitute one or two sciences, physics and 
chemistry or biology for one foreign language, ancient or modern, then will the high 
schools of this country rise to the occasion and infuse the college spirit into all their 
pupils. 
While no one will essay to contravene the logic that every teacher in every school 
(and I would not except the college) should be a paragon of excellence in the use of 
English, exemplars of a pure and polished style and untiring critics of those habits 
formed from environment which make our young people careless in their choice and 
slovenly in their arrangement of words, spoken and written, nevertheless I believe 
it of paramount importance that the department of rhetoric, English language, and 
English literature should be under the care of special teachers who are enthused on 
this subject; teachers of contagious personal influence, who worship at the throne 
of language, who have mastered the subtle power of rhetoric, and who constitute a 
thesaurus of English literature, from which they may enrich the heart, stimulate 
the intellect, and infuse the reading spirit into the soul of every pupil. 
To bo sure a physicist who looks with contempt upon the idea that he must watch 
the English expressions of his pupils in the laboratory and correet the form as well 
as the fact of their written exercises is a poor teacher and onght not to be tolerated, 
yet, as it is essential that science should be taught by scientists, and mathematics 
by mathematicians, and Latin and Greek by superb linguists, soit is equally desir- 
able that the essentials of 4 good style in writing and the inculcation of a taste for 
good reading should be in the keeping of specialists who have made the history and 
the masterpieces of literature their chief delight. 
As we can learn to converse only by conversing, to debate only by debating, and 
to write only by writing, so the pupils in all schools of all grades, including espe- 
cially the college and the university, should be constantly employed in giving their - 
thoughts a tongue and in transferring them to written exercises, essays, and theses. 
Rhetoric is being taught to-day in the colleges very much as it is in the high 
schools, and with about the same results, There is:too much distrust of the higher 
for the lower, and time is wasted in trying to do what we are prone to believe others 
have left undone. We can never lead students up the mountain heights, into the 
ether of a rarer culture if we sit and complain of the ruggedness of the foothills. 
The demand for reform and rejuvenatien and inspiration in matter and methods 
on the part of the colleges is just as great as on the part of the high schools, 
It is evident that somebody’s feelings had to be very tenderly nursed, or the Eng- 
lish conference would not have fallen into such an euphemistic expression as ‘We 
believe that the correction of specimens of bad English should not form more than 
one-fifth of the admission examination.” Having been born to no master, I would 
say one-millionth instead of one-fifth. Neither good philosophy nor good pedagogy 
will sustain the theory that the correct can be safely taught through contrast with 
the incorrect. As well may we give our pupils long and involved sentences in pro- 
fanity in order to show by contrast that we can be equally emphatic without being 
sacrilegious. As well may we slake the thirst of our children with whisky in order 
to prove the more exhilarating effects of good water. Were our children neither to 
see nor to hear at home, at school, or in the byways any incorrect English, there 
would be removed great mountains of difficulty in our efforts to secure for our pupils 
a pleasing acquisition of good forms of expression. 
A book of 150 pages was recently placed in my hands, fashioned after this plan of 
doing evil that good may come. It is replete with bad specimens and incorrect 
expressions of English. It abounds with chaff from which wheat is expected to 
germinate. It is prepared by and has the strongest indorsement of college profess- 
ors of English. It contains, as do many similar books, specimens of examination 
questions used by Harvard and other exemplary institutions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  1488 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
So long, and, O Lord, how long! So long as New England colleges insist in divid- 
ing the entrance cxamination in English into two parts—the second of which shall 
be “The candidate will be required to correct specimens of bad English set for him 
at the time of the examination ”—so long will our secondary schools produce misera- 
ble results in a study that ought to be the crown and the glory of those schools. 
At the risk of excommunication, I would recommend that a conference of primary 
and secondary teachers be appointed to suggest to the colleges some rational method 
of examination in English; then would this idea of correcting bad specimens be 
“ relegated to the limbo of discarded absurdities.” 
I am not quite in sympathy with the plan to postpone the study of technical 
rhetoric until the third year, to be limited to forty lessons, I appreciate that this 
course is in good form, and quite consonant with the dictum of the so called induct- 
ive method. O, thou baleful word induction, what sins are committed in thy name! 
Yet I believe that, following the pursuit of technical English grammar in the lower 
* schools, there should be a somewhat systematic study of the principles and maxims 
of elementary rhetoric and English composition in the first year of the high schools; 
that all these exercises should be illustrated and illuminated by the reading of 
choice specimens of English style and by original work on the part of the pupil, as 
a basis for the after study of the English classics and of English literature. In this 
way the first object of the teaching of English may be secured, viz: ‘To enable a 
pupil to understand the expressed thought of others and to give expression to 
thoughts of his own.” To secure the second, viz: ‘‘To cultivate a taste for good 
reading, to give the pupil some acquaintance with good literature, and to furnish 
him with the means of extending that acquaintance.” I would have forty or fifty 
books for the English laboratory of each of the high schools. They should be fur- 
nished in such quantities in duplicate as to accommodate all the pupils; they must 
be wisely graded and selected with the greatest care as to style and content; they 
should be suited to all talent and to every good taste, and each pupil should be 
be encouraged to read one book a month throughout the entire course. In the ear- 
lier years he should present original reproductions of some of these books, and as his 
ability to reflect and draw inferences increases he should prepare intelligent book 
reviews. 
All this written work should be conscientiously and pleasurably criticised with 
each individual writer, the best productions read as class exercises, and frequent 
conversations indulged in between teachers and pupils concerning the motive of 
the book and the lessons it inculcates. 
‘This isno idle theory. I have watched its results for some years, and it is no exag- 
geration to say that I know of scores of pupils the current of whose life and 
character has been turned into new channels by this method and who will be readers 
of the best literature while life lasts, always finding contentment, even in solitude, 
and enjoying the sublimest associations, whatever be their lot in the daily drudgery 
of life. . 
In conclusion, in no one study has there been such advancement in late years as 
in the teaching of English, and since all educational reform must come from above, 
if the colleges will modify their method of examination, abandon the deleterious 
system of presenting specimens of bad English for correction, allow our high schools 
to introduce a laboratory method of teaching English similar to that used in the 
department of physics, permitting pupils to present notebooks, essays, and book 
reviews as a partial test of their preparation, change the requirements of admission 
in foreign languages to two instead of three, allow a few discrect substitutions in 
the sciences, then will the requirements of graduation from the high schools and 
the requirements of admission to the colleges be in harmony, and we shall enter upon 
a new era of educational progress in this country before we cross the threshold of 
the twentieth century.

THE REPORT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LARGE MIXED HIGH 
SCHOOL. 
  Discussion by Principal 0. D. Robinson, 
Of the Albany (N. Y.) High School, at the thirty-second university convocation of 
the State of New York, July 5-7, 1894. 
Secondary schools may be briefly classified as of three kinds—the endowed academy, 
the wealthy boarding school, and the high school. The old-fashioned academy, as 
it is called, is rapidly passing away, giving place in some instances to the endowed 
academy or the expensive boarding school, and in others and more frequently, to 
the union school or high school. The problems for these different classes of schools 
are quite different and distinct. The endowed academies have been very properly 
termed fitting schools, and as I understand it they were and are doing their work 
very satisfactorily. The only difficulty is the lack of a common basis of admission 
to college, so that students could go from any of these large schools into any of the 
colleges. The same might be said of the boarding schools, for though the course 
there may be longer and nut so definite, yet we know that in general boys and girls 
go to these schools to stay till they are prepared for college or till they have accom- 
plished a certain course of study, whether that bo longer or shorter. The question 
is whether the report of the committee of ten and their specimen programmes satisfy 
as well the demands of the typical or ordinary high school as of these other schools, 
for it is from the latter mostly that we have heard. 
What do we mean by the typical high school? We mean the school of the city or 
large town, generally a mixed school, that is composed botli of girls and boys, where 
they enter from the grammar schools after completing a certain fixed course in 
preliminary studies there. The typical high scheol was represented by a single 
individual only and he not widely known. Dr. Harris, a man of great experience, 
understood the problem of the high school perhaps better than anyone else on the 
committee, unless it were Dr. Baker, who has had large experience in the not distant 
past. Of the other secondary school men one, a very able man, is principal of per- 
haps the wealthiest boys’ boarding school in the United States, but the problem 
there is very different from that in the ordinary city high school. The other was the 
head master of the girls’ Latin school of the city of Boston, a very able man and a 
man of large experience, yet at the head of a school just as entirely different from 
the ordinary high school as is the old endowed academy, like Exeter or Andover. As 
a result, the majority at least of the members of the committee, having had no 
recent experience in such work, failed to appreciate its needs as we do who are 
trying to solve its difficult problems. 
From the standpoint of the high school teacher, though the criticism applies to 
other schools also, I was entirely dissatisfied with the relegation of Greek to two 
years in a four-year course. I could not at first understand the position of my col- 
leagues of secondary schools on that point till remembered that the head master 
of the Boston Latin school has charge of a school in which the course is six years 
for Latin and three or four, I presume, for Greek, so that the recommendation woulé 
not touch his school at all; in the other case the head master of the school for boys 
has simply the problem of fitting boys for college. They come to him and stay tilE 
they get ready for college. But I could not understand the position of presidents of 
colleges and universities who were willing to deduct virtually one-third from the 
preparatory study of that subject which is the characteristic study of the classical 
course, and substitute a study which the committee has put itself on record as 
saying must under present conditions be inferior. I could not believe that seven or 
eight colleges were getting students too well fitted in Greek, a complaint I had never 
heard of before, but with the exception of one obstinate member there seemed to be 
perfect unanimity in relegating the preparatory Greek to two years instead of 
three,

1490 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  For the ordinary high school perhaps the next criticism that might be made on this 
report is that the programme and the work laid out there is too much on the factory 
plan of piecework—the effort to reduce the whole system of secondary school educa- 
tion to a scientific basis, where we could know beforehand just how much work was 
to be turned out provided the contract were fulfilled that the Student did the work 
assigned. While that is a comparatively simple matter in an academy or school 
organized specially for fitting students for college, it is not so easily applied to the 
ordinary high school. 
On this subject I had quite an extended correspondence with the chairman of the 
committee, and part of this has been printed in the June number of the School 
Review. Such exercises as music, drawing, elocution, orthography, and a great 
many subjects, some of which necessarily go into all high schools, seemed to be in 
danger of being left out entirely. The only thing we could get was a resolution in 
committee, that while no place was made for these in the programme, it was left to 
local authorities to deal with the matter as they saw fit. In the correspondence just 
referred to I said of the tentative report sent to the different members of the com- 
mittee for examination before the final meeting: ‘‘I can not agree with the report 
in recommending that nearly all the subjects taught in any year should be taught dur- 
ing the same number of periods per week. Table III provides no place for music, 
drawing, clocution, spelling, penmanship, etc. Such studies as stenography and 
manual training are coming into high schools and are coming to stay, and we might 
as well recognize the fact. Another and a very different class of subjects, such as 
political economy, psychology, and ethics has long been taught in secondary schools, 
and I am not prepared to recommend their abolition from the curriculum. Remem- 
bering that more than 90 per cent of high school pupils may not go to college, I con- 
sider such studies far more valuable than astronomy, meteorology, or physiography.” 
In reply to that the chairman said: “I see there is another objection in your mind 
which the committee can not meet, because the conference gives opposite advice. 
You think there must be in the high school course place for music, drawing, elocu- 
tion, spelling, penmanship, stenography, manual training, political economy, ete. 
Now I believe it to be absolutely impossible to make a course valuable for training 
to which these various and numerous subjects are admitted.” In answer I said: ‘Of 
the subjects mentioned in your letter of the 24th which are not named in the tables 
of the provisional report, such as music, drawing, etc., I am firmly convinced that 
some should have a place in every high school course, while others I think should be 
admissible in certain courses.” Of course there was no conference provided to con- 
sider the question of any of these added subjects. Very naturally, therefore, they 
find no mention in any of the reports of the conference, with the single exception of 
political economy, and that I believe the conference reports adversely as a secondary 
school study. I hold that the typical high school, in order to do its best work, must 
have some of these subjects, and if the school is large enough and its equipment is 
sufficient it should have them all. We can not leave out elocution nor music and 
have the work complete. In a high school of this kind our students fortunately 
come from all classes and families. Some come from the most refined families in the 
community, and we must have an atmosphere in which they will feel that their 
manners will not be corrupted in the high school. Others get their highest ideas of 
culture and refinement from their connection with the high school, and for them it is 
necessary to introduce as many ethic and esthetic exercises as we can without impair- 
* ing the more solid courses of study. 
I do not know that it is best to include the other class—political economy, psychol- 
ogy, and ethics—in the secondary scheol course. College men generally pronounce 
against them, but they have never told us what we should do for the 90 per cent of 
the graduates of the high school who do not go to college, and therefore can not 
study these subjects under the most favorable conditions. I believe that a properly 
equipped school will find not perhaps that these subjects are best, but that they are
-P-A-G-E-273
SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1491 
  good and that the results are satisfactory, especially when a large proportion of these 
students go out as teachers. Without training in the subjects known as the intel- 
lectual studies they will be intelligent in a way, but they can hardly appreciate the 
ordinary writing of Dr. Harris or Dr. Taylor or any of our theologians or great 
writers who contribute so freely to magazines and educational periodicals. Cer- 
tainly ethics and psychology should be taught to the senior class in the high school, 
and political economy also, for in all these some things are settled, and these as first 
principles may be taught. In spite of the blundering way in which they are often 
learned and taught, they are valuable, 
But the committee says: ‘Then teach these things, but do not do it when any- 
body is looking. Teach them as something else. Let your ethics come in as part of 
your algebra, and your psychology as part of your geography, and your political 
economy as part of your history.” Cicero long ago said that all the studies which 
pertain to culture have between themselves a certain relationship, but it does not 
follow from that that you can teach psychology from history very well or ethics 
from geography. It reminds one of the modern furnishing of our. houses, where 
everything is, as it were, something else. Your ottoman is a coal-hod and your 
diyan may be an ice-chest. A piano tuner said the other day he was afraid to sit 
down to tune a piano for fear a folding bed would fly out on him. So they would 
have these subjects taught under a different name when scholars are not aware that 
they are learning them. If you are to teach these studies, teach them by their true 
name; and though we can not do university work, yet I believe it is better to teach 
something of these than to send our scholars out with an idea that there is nothing 
in this universe except that which can be weighed and measured. The committee 
says let them go to tho college and university and they will make a better beginning. 
There they will begin with the discussion as to whether there isa soul. I do not 
object, but I stand on the proposition that I have a soul and a body. Following 
that, I believe we can teach in the high school a great deal that is valuable in these 
subjects. :

HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION.! 
By ZaLMon Ricuarps, Washington, D. C. 
  The present name of this association was assumed in 1870, at the annual meeting 
held in the city of Cleveland, Ohio. Previous to that date it bore the name of “The 
National Teachers’ Association.” This latter name was assumed a‘ its first organi- 
zation in Philadelphia, August 26, 1857. 
This association has a legitimate origin. It is not the result of any faction, acci- 
dent, or antagonism. Neither ambition nor rivalry furnished any incentives for its 
formation, for it was the natural outgrowth from the spirit of the times and the 
demands of the period. 
It is true that at the time of its origin there were not less than twenty-three State 
educational associations in this country, the first of which was organized in the 
State of New Yorkin 1845. With pleasure we also speak of the “American Institute 
of Instruction,” organized in 1830, which is stilldoing eflicient and highly commend- 
able work in its New E ngland field. The next year “after, 1831, ‘The Western Col- 
lege of Teachers” was organized in Ohio. This western association should be 
specially commended and honored for the evolutionary influence which it exerted 
not only upon the teaching fraternity of Ohio, but wpon the teachers of many other 
States. 
So far as we know now, tho first educational association in this country was‘organ- 
ized in Middletown, Conn., under the name of “ The Middlesex County Association 
for the Improvement of Common Schools.” (See note, ‘‘ Barnard’s Journal of Edu- 
cation,” Vol. II, p. 19.) 
We would also especially refer to “‘The American Association for the Advancement 
of Education,” which was the result of a ‘‘ Convention of the Friends of Common 
Schools and of Universal Education,” held in Philadelphia in December, 1849, and 
which completed its organization in 1850, Its prominent original movers and officers 
for 1849 were Hon. Horaco Mann, president; Joseph Henry, John Griscom, Samuel 
Lewis, Dr. Alonzo Potter, Greer B. Duncan, vice- presidents; Charles Northend, 
P. Pemberton Morris, Solomon Jenner, secretaries. 
The business committee were Henry” Barnard, John 8. Hart, Nathan Bishop, H. H. 
Barney, and Thomas H. Benton, jr. These are all venerable names of noble men, 
whose influence in the cause of education, public and private, will never cease to be 
felt both in our own and in other countries. 
The influence of all these associations was felt more or less by the first movers in 
the organization of the National Teachers’ Association, but the most direct influence 
came from the American Institute of Instruction, the New York Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, and the American Association for the Advancement of Education. Of the 
eleven original founders of the National Teachers’ Association, six of whom are now 
living, three, viz, T. W. Valentine, the first to suggest its organization, and at the 
    
“TRead before the National Educational Association at the meeting held in Toronto, Canada, 1891, 
1495

  1496 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
time president of the New York Teachers’ Association, J. W. Bulkley, and James 
Cruikshank, were representatives of the New York Teachers’ Association, 
Two of these founders, viz, D. B. Hagar, who prepared the original call and drew 
up the constitution, William E. Sheldon, who, with the speaker, are the only mem- 
bers present to-day, were representatives of the American Institute of Instruction, 
and of the Massachusetts State Teachers’ Association. Three of them were repre- 
sentatives of educational work in Pennsylvania, viz, J. P. Wickersham, William 
Roberts, and Edward Brooks. One, C. 8S. Pennell, was trom Missouri; one, J. D. 
Geddings, was from South Carolina; and one, the writer, Z. Richards, from the 
District of Columbia, who was also a representative of the American Institute of 
Instruction and of the American Association for the Advancement of Education. 
Five of this number, viz, T. W. Valentine, J. W. Bulkley, William Roberts, J. D. 
Geddings, and J. P, Wickersham have closed their educational work on earth to enter 
upona higher and nobler employment. , 
As above intimated, T. W. Valentine, then president of the New York Teachers’ 
Association, the oldest State teachers’ association in our country, was the first to sug- 
gest the formation of the National Teachers’ Association. After consulting with 
D. B. Hagar, of Massachusetts, and with others, he requested Mr. Hagar to prepare 
a call for a convention of the presidents of the various State teachers’ associations, 
with a few other prominent educators at that time. 
Mr. Hagar prepared the call, and Mr. Valentine sent copies to the officers and 
workers in the teachers’ associations of the whole country, asking for their coopera- 
tion; but only ten presidents responded, or consented to attach their names to the 
call. Some viewed the call with suspicion, some as visionary, and some with indif- 
ference. The call was as follows: 
To the Teachers of the United States: 
‘The eminent success which has attended the establishment and operations of the several teachers’ 
associations in the Stutes of this country is the source of mutual congratulations among all friends of opular education. ‘To the direct agency and the ditfused influence of these associations, more, per- Rene than to any other cause, are due the manifest improvement of schools in all their relations, the rapid intellectual and social elevation of teachers as a class, and the vast development of public 
interest in all that concerns the education of the young. That the State associations have already accomplished great good, and that they are destined to exert a still broader and more beneficent influence, no wise observer will deny. 
Believing that what has been accomplished for the States by State associations may be done for the 
whole country by a national association, we, the undersigned, invite our fellow-teachers throughout, 
the Unit-d States to assemble in Philadelphia on the 26th day of August next for the purpose of 
organizing a National Teachers’ Association. 
We cordially extend this invitation to all practical teachers in the North, the South, the East, and 
the West, who are willing to unite in a general effort to promote the general welfare of our country by concentrating the wisdom and power of numerous minds, and by distributing among all the accu- 
mulated experiences of all; who are ready to devote their energies and their means to advance the 
dignity, respectability, and’ usefulness of their calling; and who, in fine, believe that the time has come when the teachers of the nation should gather into ono great educational brotherhood. 
As the permanent success of any association depends very much upon the auspices attending its establishment, and the character of the organic laws it adopts, it is hoped that all parts of the Union 
will be largely represented at the inauguration of the proposed enterprise.

        In accordance with the above call many teachers of the United States assembled 
at the Atheneum Building, in Philadelphia, at 10 o’clock a. m., August 26, 1857. 
‘The meeting was called to order by T. W. Valentine, of New York, who read the 
call and made the following statement, in substance: 
We assemble here to-day under circumstances of more than ordinary interest. It is true that our 
meeting is not large in numbers, as our coming together has not be-n publicly announced in flaming advertisements. We have not expected that the quiet gathering of a body of teachers in this great city would create such a sensation as a political or commercial convention representing merely mate- 
rial interests might do, yet in its results upon the great cause of education directly, and upon the 
well-being of the country ultimately, this meeting may prove as important as many of those of a more pretentions character. We can not always see the end from the beginning. That noble band of patriots who, more than eighty years ago, sent forth to the world, from this city, the immortal Declaration of Independence, 
could scarcely have realized the mighty influence which their action was calculated to exert upon our country and the world. Allexperience, as well as the word of inspiration, admonishes us net to 
“dispise the day of small things. 
Twelve years ago, in the Empire State, the first State association of teachers in this country was 
formed. Some of us now here, who were instrumental in its formation, can well remember the fear 
and trembling with which that enterprise was commenced. Previous to this organization teachers 
everywhere were almosi cntirely unacquainted with each other, But what a mighty change a few

  years have wrought! Besides many minor organizations, there are now not less than twenty-three State teachers’ associations, each doing good work in its own sphere of labor, and to-day I trust we shall proceed to raise the capstone which shall bind all together in one solid, substantial structure. In our proposed organization we shall have no antagomisms with any of the State associations, for they have their peculiar local work, nor with tho venerable Amorican institute of Instruction, for its field has always been New England, nor with the American Association for the Advancement of Edu- cation, which was not designed to be specifically an association of teachers. What wo want is an association that shall embrace all tho teachers of our whole country, which shall hold its meetings at such central points as shall accommodate all sections and combine all inter- ests. And we need this not merely to promote the interests of our own profession, but to gather up and arrange the educational statistics of our country, so that the people may know what is really reine done fos ublie education, and what veteveriaine to bo dons: ¢ truab tha time ell Gomea nee our Government will have its educational department just as it now has one for Agriculture, for the Interior, for the Navy, ¢ We need such an crganization as shall bring the teachers of this country more together, and dis- seminato as well as collect educational intelligence. Such an effort is imperatively demanded of us, and I trust we shall now go forward and devise 
measures to accomplish these great objects. 
After the close of Mr. Valentine's address, Mr. James L. Enos, of Iowa, was made 
chairman pro tempore, and Mr, William E. Sheldon, of Massachusetts, secretary pro 
tempore. : 
After prayer by Rev. Dr. Challen, of Indiana, Mr. Hagar, of Massachusetts, offered 
the following resolutions:   
     
      
    
    
   
    
    
  
   Resolved, ‘That in the opinion of the teachers now present as representatives of various parts of the United States it is expedient to organize a national teachers’ association. Resolved, ‘Chat a committee of three be appvinted by the chair to prepare a constitution adapted to such an association.      
After a full and free discussion of the resolutions they wero adopted unanimously, 
and the chair appointed Messrs. Hagar, of Massachusetts; Cann, of Georgia, and 
Challen, of Indiana, to prepare and report a constitution. 
The convention then engaged in a general discussion upon the condition of edu- 
cational systems and methods in different parts of our country. In the afternoon 
the committee on a constitution reported, * * * 
- On motion of 'T. W. Valentine, a committee of one from each State and district 
represented in the convention was appointed by the chair to nominate a list of offi- 
cers at the evening session. . 
The following persons were appointed, viz: 
William Roberts, of Pennsylvania; J. F. Cann, of Georgia; James Cruikshank, of 
New York; D. B. Hagar, of Massachusetts; James L. Enos, of Iowa; N. R. Lynch, 
of Delaware; J. R. Challen, of Indiana; Thomas Granger, of Illinois; E. W. Whelan, 
of Missouri; J. W. Barnett, of Illinois; Z. Richards, of the District of Columbia, 
and J. D. Geddings, of South Carolina. 
At the opening of the evening session, Chairman Enos presiding, Mr. T. W. Val- 
entine was called upon to read the specially prepared and valuable address,of Prof. 
William Russell, of Massachusetts, whose ill-health prevented his attendance. 
‘This address set forth the importance of this convention to organize an association 
of professional teachers that shall be national in its character: 
First, As regards wider and juster views of education, and corresponding methods 
of instruction. 
Second. As giving an opportunity for the. establishing of a national society of 
teachers, from which we may expect great national benefits. (See Professor Russell’s 
address, in full, in Barnard’s Journal of Education, Vol. IV, new series, 1864.) 
After the reading of the address, the committee on nomination of the first officers 
made the following report:

This inaugural meeting was harmonious, enthusiastic, and characteristic of the 
founders, the future workers, and the future meetings of the association. 
Ata meeting of the directors alter adjournment, they resolved to hold the first 
annual meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio, on the second Wednesday in August, 1858, at 
10 o’clock a.m. After making full arrangements for the next meeting, and express- 
ing their harmonious purposes, the directors adjourned.

  1498 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
THE FIRST ANNUAL MEETING. 
  Of the thirty-eight signers of the constitution at the time of its adoption only five 
were present at tho finst annual meeting. Appropriate arrangements, however, had 
been made by Mr. A. J. Rickoff, super: intendent of the Cineinnati public schools, as 
chairman of the local committee, for the reception of a large delegation. 
When the time came for calling the meeting to order it was found that only five of 
the constituent members were present, viz., the president, the first vice-president, 
the secretary, and two counselors. 
These few members, however, were heartily welcomed by a very large audience, 
who were then, and have always been, in blissful ignorance of the small representa- 
tion of actual members, 
After the usual welcome by the dignitaries of Cincinnati, the president called his 
four coadjutors into service by keeping the secretary by his side on the platform, and 
by assigning special duties to the three other members, who were located in different 
parts of the largo audience. 
Upon the motion of one of these members the secretary was called upon to read 
the constitution of the association for the information of those present who night be 
disposed to become members. 
After the reading of the constitution and some explanatory remarks by the presi- 
dent, another of these members moved that an opportunity be given for any person 
to become amember. The opportunity was granted, of course, The secretary and, 
in the absence of the treasurer, one of the three others acting as treasurer, were kept 
busy for some time in receiving fees and in recording names of applicants, until the 
number of new members had reached about seventy-five. 
This movement, fortunately, furnished a good working body, and prepared the 
way for other additions. The president, thus being relieved from apprehended 
embarrassment in consequence of the small number of members, at first proceeded 
to deliver his inaugural address, in which he pointed ont the canses and the demands 
for forming a national teachers’ associatien, and urged the following important 
ends to be aimed at in its future work: 
First. The union of all teachers, North, South, East, and West, in friendly asso- 
ciated action, for strengthening the cause of education. 
Second. To create and permanently establish a teachers’ profession by methods 
usually adopted by other professions. 
Third. To secure the examination of all teachers, by making the examining boards 
to consist of competent, practical teachers. 
Fourth. To increase the number ef normal schools, and establish departments of 
pedagogics in connection with all schools which send out persons to teach. 
During the sessions of this first anniversary there was a full attendance, a deep 
interest and close attention to all the exercises of the programme. 
Among the large number of representative teachers and educators present, besides 
the officers, were the following persons: Hon. Horace Mann, Supt. J. D. Phil- 
brick, John Hancock, A. J. Rickoft, I. W. Andrews, William Russell, W. E. Crosby, 
John Ogden, C. E. Hovey, Rev. J. N, MacJilton, Prof, Daniel Read, Anson Smyth,

THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 1499 
One of the most prominent questions discussed at this first annual meeting was 
that of “Parochial schools.” ‘The leading thought of the discussion was that 
“moral training, ‘without sectarianism, is necessary.” 
The inspiring influence of woman in our educational meetings was welcomed and 
emphasized by the association. 
After the adjournment of the association, the board of directors met and agreed to 
hold the next annual meeting in the city of Washington, D. C., and appointed Mr. 
Z. Richards, of Washington, as chairman of the local committee, to make all loeal 
arrangements. * * 
As proof of the genuine national spirit of the originators of this association, we 
may refer to one of the first resolutions, passed at the time of its organization, as 
follows: 
Resolved, That there shall be six lecturers appointed for the next meeting—two from the Southern, 
two from the Western, one from the Middle, and one from the Eastern States. 
As this resolution was offered by a true-blue New Englander, it shows the charac- 
teristic modesty of the Eastern States in not assuming honors which belong equally 
to the other States. This liberal spirit has at all times characterized the operations 
of this association. It started out with high patriotic purposes, and to its honor it 
may be recorded that there has never been a single manifestation in any of its official 
operations of aspirit of sectionalism or of partisanship. Its officers and its managers 
have generally been selected, first, from its most faithful and best qualified workers, 
which should always be the’ case; and, second, as representatives of all sections of 
our country. 
Its friends have worked assiduously for the general cause of public and univer- 
sal education, and not for pecuniary advantage, nor for office, nor for personal 
honor, °** 
NAME AND PLAN OF ORGANIZATION CHANGED. 
At the Cleveland meeting, in 1870, the constitution was so amended as to admit 
cooperation and combination with two other educational associations: F° irst, the 
American Normal Association, which was organized in 1864; second, the National 
Superintendents’ Association, organized in 1805. At the same time the constitution 
was so amended that other departments could be organized, and immediately two 
other departments were organized, viz, the department of higher instruction and 
the department of primary or elementary instruction. A full set of subordinate 
officers, viz, a president and secretary for each department, was chosen, who were 
to provide their own programme of exercises for their annual meetings. 
Until 1870 all the edueational topics were discussed before the whole association 
asabody. While this method of performing educational work has many superior 
advantages, it would be hazardous either to abandon the pian of departments or to 
proportionately extend the length or number of sessions so that the whole member- 
ship could have an opportunity. to listen to all papers and discussions. * * 
In 1875 the industrial department was organized and admitted under the consti- 
tutional provision. 
In 1880 the National Council of Education was organized as a department, but 
under a constitution of its own which required its sixty or more members to be chosen 
from the general association and from the several departments.! 
Very few persons are aware of the important work performed by the National 
Council of Edueation, unless they attend its sessions or read its papers and discus- 
sions from year to year. 
But its meetings and deliberations were to be held so as not to interfere with the 
general assoc tion and the department mectings. 
During the first twenty years of its operations its officers were often obliged to put 
their hands down deep into their own pockets to meet the annual current expenses. 
This had to be done in addition to the regular membership fee and the often very 
heavy traveling expenses. 
But in 1884 a new era dawned upon the association. It is true that the enlarge- 
ment of the association’s field of labor in 1870, at the Cleveland meeting, by engraft- 
ing upon itself the more specific work of the departments of superintendents of 
normal schools, of higher instruction, and of elementary training, besides providing 
constitutionally for creating other departments, has done much to broaden the sphere 
of its work and inspire conlidence in its plan of operations. 
But no organization in this age of the world can work or exist long without money. 
Many of the real friends of this association found that tho constant ¢ draining of their 
pockets to keep the ponderous wheels in motion was also draining their patience and 
weakening their faith in its perpetuity.

1500 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Some of the hopeful members had heard of an Eastern man who had come to the 
rescue of the American Institute of Instruction when it was almost ready to perish. 
This man was made president of the institute, and he made a grand rally, which 
athered together such a multitude of educators at the White Mountains of New 
ampshire that the increased income has been sufticient to keep that institute in a 
prosperous condition ever since. f 
This gratifying success inspired some of the almost despziring members of the 
National Educational Association to call to its leadership the Hon. Thomas W. 
Bicknell, of Massachusetts. The grand success of the Madison meeting, in Wiscon- 
sin, in 1884, inaugurated a new financial era by largely increasing the number of 
members. Since then, by making the annual meetings attractive, and by lessening 
the expense of attending them, the membership has so increased that the funds of 
our treasury, now safely invested in interest-bearing bonds, are sufficient, with pru- 
dent manayement, to forever insure the association against financial embarrassment. 
This financial security serves to increase the usefulness of the association, and to 
guarantee its permanency. At tlie close of the Madison meeting Hon. E. E. White 
offered the following resolution, which shows how highly the association appreciated. 
the services of President Bicknell. The resolution was passed unanimously: 
Resolved, That the unparalleled success of this meeting is chiefly due to the energy, devotion, and organizing ability of Hon. T. W. Bicknell, the president of this association, whose wise and compre- hensive plans, enthusiastic and self sacrificing efforts, and directing haud have inspired and guided the great undertaking from its inception to its present triumphant close, and no formal words can properly express our thankful appreciation. 
Historically, let it be added, that not one dollar of these funds has ever been added 
to the emolument of an officer, nor furnished him any ‘‘ boodle” for speculation. 
In 1884 three new departments were organized and entered upon their peculiar 
work. These were the Froebel or kindergarten, the art, and the music departments. 
In 1885 the department of secondary education was added to the list, making the 
whole number ten. 
INCORPORATION OF THE ASSOCIATION. 
At a meeting of the board of directors of the National Educational Association, 
held at Saratoga Springs, N. Y., July 14, 1885, the following resolution was passed: 
Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed to secure articles of incorporation for the National Educational Association, under United States or State laws, as speedily as may be. 
N. A. Calkins, of New York, Thomas W. Bicknell, of Massachusetts, and Eli T. 
Tappan, of Ohio, were appointed such committee. 
Under the authority of the resolution quoted above, and with the approval of the 
committee, and by competent legal advice, the chairman obtained the following: 
CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. 
  We, the undersigned, Norman A, Calkins, Jobn Eaton, and Zalmon Richards, citizens of the United States, and two of them citizens of the District of Columbia, do hereby associate ourselves together, 
pursuant to the provisions of the act of general incorporation, class third, of tho revised statutes of the District of Colmnbia, under the name of the National Educational Association, for the full period of twenty years, the purpose and objects of which are to clevate the character and advance the inter- ests of thé profession of teaching, and to promote the cause of popular education in the United States. * * * ‘To secure the full benefit of said act, we do here execute this our certificate of incorporation. d act provides. In witness whercof we severally set our hands and seals this 24th day of February, 1886, at Wash- ington, D.C.

The action of the committee on incorporation was submitted to the board of 
directors at Topeka, Kans., July 13, 1886, and the act of incorporation was duly 
approved by the board of directors. 
A committee was appointed to prepare the changes'in the constitution necessary 
to meet the requirements of the charter. At the meeting of the National Educa- 
tional Association held at Topeka, July 15, 1886, the chairman—E. E. White, of 
Ohio—presented the report of the committee on amendments to the constitution, 
and the report was unanimously adopted.! 
These departments are all legitimate children, though two of them have been 
adopted and are older than their parent. But they are a harmonious, hard working, 
and a thriving family. If anyone needs to be convinced of the truth of this state- 
ment, let him undertake to read and thoroughiy digest even one of the late volumes 
  1 Phe constitution of the National Educational Associatio
-P-A-G-E-283
THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 1501 
of the annual proceedings. If one copy does not convince him, let him procure a 
full set of the twenty-two copies from our custodian at Washington, and he will 
have one of the best pedagogical libraries, especially if he will add to it the twenty- 
five or thirty volumes of Barnard’s Journal of Education, 
The amount of original educational matter now presented at each of our annual 
meetings is some six or eight times greater than it was for each of the first fifteen or 
eighteen years of its Work. What still adds to the value of these volumes is the 
generally improved character of the papers and discussions. While very many of 
the early papers read before the association can not be excelled in value and impor- 
tance, still, during these later years, the officers have taken special care to let nothing 
but new and original matter be presented to the various departments from year to 
year. As the authors of these papers are generally selected from the large number 
of first-class educators in our growing country, the papers are becoming more and 
more elevated and valuable, and contain the best and ripest thoughts of this educa- 
tional era. The same may be said in regard to the character of the discussions in 
these various departments, which are quite fully published in these volumes. 
‘The influence of this national educational association is diffusive and permeating, 
and is giving character to the systems of education and of school work in all parts 
of our own country and in other countries—as in South America, Japan, and the 
Sandwich Islands, and perhaps in some of the old countries of Europe. There is not 
a State, county, city, or town in all our country where tle influence of our associa- 
tional work is not more or less felt. Even the colleges, the universities, and private 
educational institutions are perhaps, unconsciously ‘to themselves, feeling this diffu- 
sive infinence. 
Though the influence of the association is more plainly,.effectually, and promptly 
felt in the newer portions of our country, yet those States and cities which have been 
pioneers in educational work so long as to be sometimes chargeable with ‘old fogy- 
ism” have felt, and are now feeling, the transforming influences of the papers and 
discussions of this great body of educators. 
ITS MEMBERSHIP. 
  The membership of the association is made up of annual members, who pay $2 a 
year; of life members, who pay $20; of life directors, who pay $100; also of perpetual 
directorships, which are usually secured by boards of education, or associations, 
through the payment of $100. This perpetual directorship confers the privilege of 
sending any one of its members to the meetings, as its representative, which repre- 
sentative shall be entitled to all the privileges of the association, during his attend- 
ance, that belong to a life director. 
It will be readily understood that the annual memberships of this association are 
changeable because of the migratory meetings—from Boston to St. Paul, Philadel- 
phia to Chicago, Baltimore to St. Louis, San Francisco to Nashville, Saratoga to 
Topeka, Atlanta to Toronto. During the past ten years the attendance at these 
meetings has varied from 500 to 10,000. The largest attendance was at Chicago in 
1887, the next was at San Francisco in 1888. The meetings at St. Paul in 1890, and 
at Toronto, Canada, in 1891, were both very large meetings. The constant and 
unchangeable membership is made up of life ‘members, life directors, and about an 
equal number of regular and active annual members. 
It would be @ wise and an economical move if the younger members, both male 
and female; who wish to retain their working membership should add $18 to their 
annnal membership fee at once, and thus constitute themselves life members. 
The great advantages of these large migratory meetings are not confined to the 
financial Benet of this association, for it is a generally acknowledged fact that 
their influence has been essentially beneficial to the cities and States where they 
have been held, and that the cause of education and public school instruction has 
been elevated and greatly improved in every section of our country. 
This association has been, and now is, the bodyguard of public school instruction 
in our country.   
THE SCHOOL EXPOSITIONS, 
Since the organization of the industrial, the art, and the kindergarten dspart- 
ments and their auxiliary combination with the general association, the interest in 
the annual meetings has greatly increased. T! he | school exhibits in many instances 
have been of a remarkable character, and it must be admitted by every careful 
observer of: their influence upon the practical life of our youth that they have con- 
tributed essentially to the educative power of the public school systems. 
The readers of the annual proceedings will find the reports of these exhibits 
highly suggestive and instructiv e.

THE WORKERS OF THE ASSOCIATION. 
  A merciful Providence has kindly watched over the friends and supporters of this 
association. Thirty men have been called to preside over and direct its interests 
during the thirty-four years of its existence. 
No meetings were held in 1861, 1862, 1867, and 1878. Twenty-one of its presidents 
are now living. Nine honored men have been called to go up higher, viz, John W. 
Bulkley, of Brooklyn, N. Y., the third president; John D. Philbrick, of Boston, 
Mass., the fourth president; William H. Wells, of Chicago, Il1., the fifth president; S. 
S. Greene, of Providence, R. I., the sixth president; S.H. White, of Peoria, Ill., the 
fourteenth president; Gustavus J. Orr, of Atlanta, Ga., the twenty-first president; 
Eli T. Tappan, of Ohio, the twenty-second president; J. P. Wickersham, of Penn- 
sylvania, the seventh president; and John Hancock, of Columbus, Ohio, the 
eighteenth president. 
‘These were all men of educational faith, who performed the work of their life nobly 
and have gone to their graves greatly honored and beloved by all who knew them. 
We have good reason to believe and expect that the twenty-one surviving presidents 
will be able to go to their final reward, when it is to be rendered, with equally untar- 
nished honors and with a revered memory. 
We fecl also constrained to express our high appreciation and commendation of 
one of our most faithful and indefatigable secretaries, W. D. Henkle, of Ohio. 
At our second anniversary in Washington the association was called upon to 
express its deep sorrow and regret at the death of the Hon. Horace Mann, who gave 
a valuable lecture at our first anniversary. Other true and valuable members have 
closed their educational work on earth to engage in a higher and nobler work, we 
trust, in the spiritual mansions of the Great ‘Teacher. * * 
THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION: ITS ORGANIZATION AND 
FUNCTIONS.' 
By Hon. Wi1t1aM T. Harris, 
United States Commissioner of Education. 
Thirty-three years ago last August there met in the city of Philadelphia a handful 
of men to organize a national teachers’ association. The movement started in New 
York and Massachusetts. A call had been issued and widely circulated the year 
before (1856) inviting ‘all practical teachers in the North, the South, the East, and 
the West who are willing”—these are its significant words—“ who are willing to unite 
in a general effort to promote the general welfare of our country by concentrating 
the wisdom and power of numerous minds and by distributing among all the accu- 
mulated experiences of all; who are ready to devote their energies and their means 
to advance the dignity, respectability, and usefulness of their calling.” A constitu- 
tion was drafted and adopted, and officers were elected for the following year. The 
directory of the newly formed association voted to meet in Cincinnati in August, 
1858. The noteworthy feature in the constitution adopted is the government of the 
association by a board of directors elected at the annual meeting. This board was 
to consist of a large number of counselors, one from each State, district, or Territory, 
together with the president, secretary, treasurer, and twelve vice-presidents. It 
also became the practice, even from this early meeting, to appoint a large nominating 
committee—one member from each State represented i in the convention. Inasmuch 
as it has frequently happened that only a single delegate was present from a State, 
the nominating committee has been obliged to fill out its extensive list of officers by 
naming its owr members. The first president of the association, as well as seven of 
the vice-presidents and two of the counselors, ten in all, were members of the 
nominating committee that reported their names. While this strikes us at first as 
bad form, or even as dangerous to the usefulness of the association, a moment’s 
reflection convinces us that the danger is imaginary and affects the form rather 
than the substance of the thing. If ‘an entire assembly appoints itself on a nomi- 
nating body, and then names all of its members to one office or another, it amounts to 
the same asa committee of the whole for the nomination of officers and a distribu- 
tion of offices to all. 
In later years, since the association has grown to gigantic proportions, it is true 
that this large committee has dwindled in comparison to the sizo of the body it 
represents, But the fact that the rule requires that all the States, districts, and 
Territories shall be represented on the board of directors secures a variety of inter- 
ests in that board, which prevents the possibility of clannishness or misrule. 
Should, however, it be deemed desirable to provide even a wider participation of 
the rank and file of the association in the election of its directory, this could be easily

effected by a constitutional provision permitting cach State delegation to select its 
member of the nominating committee, leaving the president to select, as heretofore, 
for those States that decline or neglect toact. Practically, this would bea safeguard 
against any possible influence that might come from partisanship or political man- 
agement, but it is quite difficult to conceive any circumstances wherein danger is to 
be apprehended from such source. All will agree, however, that the highest useful- 
ness of the association depends on the complete subordination of the political partisan 
element. 
We may here properly inquire what the legitimate results are which we should 
look to come from this annual gathering of teachers from the length and breadth of 
theland. The main answer to this is provided for us in the words of the original call 
issued in 1856. In the language already quoted, the association should ‘concentrate 
the wisdom and power of numerous minds, and distribute among all the experiences 
ofall.” This call was written by Dr. Daniel B. Hagar, then president of the Massa- 
chusetts Teachers’ Association. It was stated at the Philadelphia meeting in 1857 
that there were already in existence twenty-three State teachers’ associations, besides 
larger and smaller associations not bounded by State lines—such, for example, as the 
American Institute of Instruction in New England, and the American Association for 
the Advancement of Education, which had been formed in Philadelphia. ‘These asso- 
ciations had demonstrated the value of general conferences in which educational 
topics were discussed. The wisdom and power of many minds concentrated on the 
difficult problems of the profession brought light such as none hadseen before. The 
accumulated experience of all was thus distributed to each. The individual teacher, 
in his uneven development, strong in some points and weak in others, found com- 
plementary strength in the experience of his fellow-teachers, strong where he was 
weak and perhaps weak where he was strong. $ 
The divine principle of vicariousness that prevails in the spiritual world, render- 
ing it possible for each man, woman, and child to participate profitably in the 
experience of another human being—so that the spectacle of a deed and its conse- 
quences renders it entirely unnecessary to perform the deed itself in order to get 
what of good comes from doing it as a life experience—this divine principle of 
vicariousness in the life of human souls at once explains for us the true function of 
teachers’ associations and also the function of education itself in its entirety, What, 
indeed, is all education except the reenforcement of the individual by the experience 
of the family, the community, the nation, the race? Education is, therefore, properly 
defined as the elevation of the individual into participation in the life of the species. 
While the brute inherits organically in his muscles and nerves and brain the expe- 
rience of his progenitors in such a way that the life of his race appears as instinctive 
impulse, man, on the other hand, not only inherits the results of the life of his 
aneestry in the form of instincts and aspirations, but he can by language receive 
and communicate the outcome of his life direct. Hence his ability to collect within 
himself the results of others’ lives is increased infinitely beyond that narrow line 
of hereditary descent; for he can, through language, avail himself of the sense- 
perception of others far removed in time and space, making himself thereby a sort of 
omnipresence in space and time. Then, too, he can avail himself in like manner of 
the thoughts and reflections of his fellow-men, especially the thoughts and reflec- 
tions of those most gifted minds that have done most to solve the problems of life 
and explain the anomalies of experience. More than this, too, he learns not only 
through their perceiving and by their thinking on what they perceive, but he learns 
by seeing their doing, and by the story of their doing, what to do himself and what 
to refrain from doing. ‘Thus by language the individual is enabled to live vicari- 
ously the life of the race, and to live his own life vicariously for others. Whatever 
one does goes into the reservoir of human experience as something of value; if itis 
a negative deed, bringing with it its punishment, the knowledge of it renders unnec- 
essary the repetition of its like by others. If it is a positive deed, securing for it 
the normal development of the soul, then it is a precious discovery, and it may be 
adopted by all men as a new ethical form or moral law. 
Thus the very principle of all education—the principle that makes possible what 
we value as civilization in contrast to savage life—this principle is appealed to as 
explaining and justifying the existence of a national edueational association. 
“Concentrate the wisdom and power of numerous minds; distribute to each the 
accumulated experience of all.” 
Who can say, looking back down the ladder of thirty-three years, that this benefi- 
cent process of giving and receiving has not characterized every stage of its ascent? 
Spiritual giving, we are taught, is not a giving which diminishes the supply of the 
giver. In material giving there is a transfer which makes him who gives poorer by 
the amount of his gift. But he who imparts his experience to others possesses all 
the more firmly all the fruits of his own experience. Every teacher who has risen 
in this National Educational Association to expound his own oieeyatens or reflec- 
tions, or to give the results of his experience, has, in the act of doing it, helped 
     
-P-A-G-E-286

  himself first of all to see more clearly than before the true lesson of his life. In 
spiritual participation, there is no division or loss. In material things—in food, 
clothing, and shelter—to share is to divide and diminish the part that goes to each. 
But these general principles we may admit, and yet fail to see in the work of the 
National Educational Association anything worthy of being classed under such high 
rubrics. Let us, therefore, take up in detail, that all may recognize, some of the 
phases of tho teacher’s work that have been under discussion at the annual gatherings. 
I find, on looking over the table of contents of the annual volumes of proceedings, 
that there have been presented 241 papers on the five parts of the school system, 
namely, 28 on the kindergartens, 27 on primary work, 75 on high schools and colleges, 
56 on normal schools, 45 on manual training and technical schools. 
These 241 papers have all related, incidentally, to matters of course of study and 
methods. But besides these there were 21 papers relating especially to the philoso- 
phy of methods, 81 to various branches of the theory of education and psychology, 29 
to the course of study, 10 to the peculiarities of graded and ungraded schools, 25 to 
musical instruction, 10 to natural sciences, 40 on drawing, and 24 to the important 
subject of moral and religious instruction. These make 240 additional papers on 
special themes of course of study and methods of discipline and management—in the 
aggregate nearly 500 papers on these themes. 
Besides these papers there are others—on building, heating, and ventilation, 3; 
national aid to education, 14; education for Chinese, Indians, and colored people, 8; 
on supervision of schools, 10; on the uses and abuses of text-books, 9; on examina- 
tions of teachers and of pupils, 8; on compulsory education, 3; foreign educational 
systems, 10; education and crime, 2; on the best methods of keeping statistics, 4; on 
the criticisms urged against our schools, 8; in all nearly 100 more papers on impor- 
tant questions. 
We all remember with some remaining feelings of dismay the old-fashioned essays 
read at teachers’ gatherings. The following titles will suggest them: ‘The teachers’ 
motives,” ‘The teacher aud his work,” ‘The causes of failure and success in the 
work of the teacher,” and ‘‘The teacher's ideal.” Very often such titles introduced 
only goody-goody reflections on the personal character of the teacher. In the early 
days of the association such essays were more frequent. One is glad to observe their 
growing rarity, not only in the National Educational Association, but also in State 
associations and in educational magazines. 
Of course these 600 papers, relating to various points of school management, were 
only the half of the intellectual pabulum set forth at the annual gatherings. It is 
safe to say that the impromptu discussions called forth were at least another half. 
Where the undisciplined mind had flagged and failed to follow the thread of the 
written discourse, the oral discussion brought out vividly the points of the paper, 
and by vigorous opposition or defense aroused the powers of the weakling. ‘Phe 
vigorous oral debate has here its tremendous advantages over the printed paper 
read in the educational periodicals. 
We have not mentioned the advantage of personal contact of mind with mind. In 
these gatherings the young teacher sees those who have grown old in the service and 
who have acquired. reputation for their work. He meets his equals and measures 
their ideals by hisown. He learns to see the details of his profession from many 
different points of view. The impression derived from the printed page differs from 
that derived from personal conversation. Each has its advantages. The personal 
impression is more stimulating and provocative of imitation. The cool study of the 
printed paper leads to deeper self-activity. Both are useful, nay, indispensable. 
It is obvious that for this personal lesson upon the teacher our recent large asso- 
ciations are far more valuable than the small gatherings of the early date; where 
three hundred met then, now we have three thousand. ‘The visitor to the association 
now sees ten times the number of eminent teachers, and rejoices in a tenfold oppor- 
tunity for profit. 
I do not think that I overestimate the value of this feature of the educational 
association when I call it one-half. Ou this basis I shall call the direct aid received 
from the essays and papers read one-fourth; the direct aid from the debatesand discus- 
sions, one-fourth; the direct aid from personal conversation with and observation of 
fellow-members of the convention, eminent persons, and otherwise, this, and the 
benefit of observation on that section of the country into which the association takes 
the visitor, amounts to one-half the direct aid that he gets at the association. 
Since 1870 the association has been in process of forming departments for the fur- 
ther specialization of work. It has done this partly by absorbing existing associa- 
tions devoted to special work, and partly by forming new departments direct. 
It absorbed the normal school aud superintendents’ associations, and, in after years, 
successively the departments of (a) higher instruction, (b) elementary instruction, 
(c) industrial education, (d) the National Council of Educ n, (e) the kindergarten, 
(f) the art education, (y) music instruction, and (h) secondary instruction; thus mak- 
ing ten departments in all. There has been since 1884 an educational exposition, 
which may be called the eleventh department, 
     
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDIES. 1505 
'- Since these departments provide for the much-needed specialization of work, and 
furnish a counterpoise to the mighty swing of the general meetings of the associa- 
tion, their influence is salutary. There is no doubt that much more can be done in 
this direction. There should be a department that unites those interested in the 
study of child life; another that unites the specialists who are at work in the mastery 
of foreign systems of education; one for students of the Herbartian educational 
experiments—those that make so much of Robinson Crusoe as a center of school work, 
and whose great word is ‘‘apperception.” ‘Those who have read the educational 
essay that has made so much noise in England, and which bears the absurd title of 
“A Pot of Green Feathers,” I need not say, are already interested in this question of 
apperception, as the very center of educational psychology. The doctrine of apper- 
ception, briefly stated, is this: We not only perceive objects, but we recognize or 
apperceive them. When we apperceive we relate what we see to what we already 
knew before; we sometimes call this inward digestion of what we see. Now educa- 
tion, it is evident enough, deals with this matter of recognizing or similating (apper- 
ceiving) the new material learned by relating it to what we knew before. 
If a department of psychology were formed that held two meetings at each annual 
session, I doubt not that it would soon prepare some work which would gladly be 
given a place on the programme of the general association, and certainly before it 
secured a place on the programme it would get into the old departments of elementary 
instruction or normal instruction, or into the superintendents’ section or some other. 
I would lay emphasis on the specializing of work indefinitely. Apart from the 
national association such specializing would have its danger; but in the association 
it at once adds strength and gains strength. There could be a department of statis- 
tical study, wherein the few specialists who are interested in the science of statistics, 
in the new sense which is coming to be accentuated by sociologists, could confer 
together round a table. Round-table discussions over specialties is, in my opinion, 
what is needed to introduce a new fountain of vitality into the association. Not 
that the association is failing in vitality, for it never had so much at any former 
period as it has now. But this new element of specialization is a new element of 
vitality which may make the annual visit twice as valuable as it has been hitherto. 
Ihave mentioned by way of examples of these round-table departments, those that 
should study child life, foreign systems of education (say French, German, English, 
Chinese, etc.), or pedagogical movements like that of the Herbartians, or, again, 
educational psychology, or statistics. I would add other examples of specialization. 
Let the specialists in teaching English literature have around table; the specialists 
in teaching ancient history or modern history or the philosophy of history; the 
specialists in teaching French or any modern language; those specially interested in 
teaching fractions or any other part of arithmetic. These round-table discussions 
could be called for any year. They could not be expected to discuss the same sub- 
ject for two consecutive years. Here is just the trouble with our present depart- 
ments. They have worked over the material ready to hand, and have no new 
material in the process of making. The council of education has formed a list of 
committees on a variety of subjects and stereotyped it once for all. The members 
of those cast-iron committees find themselves appointed to report on some subject 
which has no new fresh interest for them, and they do not see how to begin fresh 
work, We donot want any more reports on such general topics as high schools, or 
private schools, or coeducation, or moral education, or educational psychology, but 
we do want specialized reports which focus the whole mind of the subcommittees on 
some special topic, within those more general topics such as (in the domain of 
moral education) the freedom of the will in the light of Ribot’s work on The Dis- 
eases of the Will; or (in the domain of educational psychology) the effect of com- 
mitting to memory by the so-called aids or arts of memory; or on the formation of 
logical habits of thinking; or the best method of cultivating a convenient memory 
for names; the true remedy for duplicate registration of pupils attending both 
winter and summer schools, a duplication which is common in most of the State 
school reports; on a legitimate mode of interesting the people in electing good mem- 
bers to the school board; on the proper manner of securing the interest of the pub- 
lic press in the good features of the public schools; on the effect of the private 
schools in raising or lowering the standard ot respectability in the profession of 
teaching; on the best method of securing literary and scientific culture in a corps of 
teachers. Noone of these topics would do for a second report; no one of them would 
do for a first report made by members of the council not interested in it. The vol- 
_unteer system is the only system for round-table work. It would be best generally 
to concentrate attention, and guide it by having a report made upon some particular 
book, like Lange’s work on Apperception, or Mrs. Jacobi’s book on Science and 
Language Study. 
The general work of the association, as a whole, should go on in deep ruts, but 
the special work of the departments should be specialized and always fresh and 
new. This will take care of itself if there be a sufficiency of these small groups 
ED 93: 95   
 
-P-A-G-E-288
1506 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
encouraged. Perhaps there are only four persons in the entire nation interested in 
some special topic. The National Association, with its facilities for cheap transpor- 
tation and cheap board, furnishes the best opportunity each year for the meeting of 
these four persons, or any other similarly interested four persons. Perhaps the 
attraction of the particular interest would not be sufficient to draw together the 
four specialists. But the National Association adds a host of other attractions, and 
in the aggregate these are strong enough to prevail. i 
We wish to produce as many growing teachers as pessible—as many as possible 
who each year have found fresh leads and have distanced their former selves. 
It seems to me, therefore, quite doubtful whether the division of the National 
Association into sectional associations, with which it alternates biennially, would 
not be rather a step backward. It would perhaps break the continuity which is 
essential as a kind of background on which the specialization which we have dis- 
cussed can best take place. It will certainly make the familiar faces that meet us 
from year to year, coming from a great distance—as in the present meeting, from 
Colorado and Texas—it will make these faces less familiar to us, and different sec- 
tions of the Union will be in less direct sympathy than formerly. 
If I havo studied aright this problem, it is not the general association that is in 
need of reform, but only the departments. These departments, instead of breaking 
away from the type of the general association, as they should do, are imitating its 
organization when they ought to devote themselyes to developing and fostering 
voluntary subcommittees or round tables devoted to special work. : 
The general association, with its wide scope, its great masses, its distinguished 
personalities, its cheap fares, its entertaining tours, and its spectacle of great com- 
bination, and, lastly, with the great interest and substantial tributes of respect 
which it elicits from the business men of all parts of the country, and from the world 
in general outside the scholastic field—the general association, with these reasons 
for being, should continue as it is.

  NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION. 
CONSTITUTION, 
PREAMBLE. 
Tho National Council of Education shall have for its object the consideration and discussion of edu- cational questions of general interest aud public importance, and the presentation through printed reports of the substance of tho discussions and the conclusions formulated. It shall be its object to reach and disseminate correct thinking on educational questions, and for this purpose it shall be the aim of the council in conducting its discussions to define and state with accuracy the different views and theories on the subject under consideration, and, secondly, to discover and represent fairly the grounds and reasons for each theory or view, so far as to show as completely as possible the genesis of opinion on the subject. It shall be theduty of the council in pursuance of this object to encourage from all its members the most careful statement of differences in opinion, together with the com- 
pletest statement of grounds for the same. It shall further require from the chairmen of its com- mittees the careful preservation and presentation of the individual differences of opinion whenever ‘ounds have been furnished for the same by members of their committees. It shall invite the freest Giseneston of the reports of ite committees, and whenever said. reports are not so amended, az to embody the new suggestions developed by such discussion, any member making such suggestion or objection may put in writing his view and the grounds therefor, and furnish the same to the secre- tary for the records of the council.

  A CLASSIFIED LIST OF THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS CONSIDERED IN 
THE VOLUMES OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION, FROM 1870 TO 1893, INCLUSIVE.! : 
This classified list gives the topics upon which papers have been read before the 
association, the name of the author, and the volume, or year, in which the paper 
may be found. 
Prior to 1870 there were three national associations in the United States considering 
educational work, each independent of the others—The National Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, organized in 1857; The American Normal Association, and The National 
Superintendents’ Association. At the joint annual meetings in August, 1870, these 
associations united, forming The National Educational Association of the United 
States, with departments for the consideration of distinct phases of educational 
work. « 
The joint publication of the proceedings of these associations began with the vol- 
ume for 1870, It is now hardly possible to find copies of the proceedings of either 
of these associations prior to that date. They were generally issued in pamphlet 
form, and seldom contained all the papers read at the meetings. Beginning with 
1870, each volume is bound in cloth. 
The volumes for 1870 and 1872 are now out of print. A limited number of copies 
remain for the years 1871, 1882, 1883. The volume for 1893 contains the proceedings 
of the International Congress of Education.

CHAPTER IV. 
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO—ITS CHARACTER AND 
FACILITIES, 
  Though the possibility and the necessity of educating the negro population of the 
United States have been very thoroughly discussed by legislative and philanthropic 
bodies and the periodical press, nevertheless there seems wanting a systematic and 
detailed statement of the facilities for the instruction of colored persons within 
the Union and of the more general features which characterize their school life. 
In supplying and in systematizing a body of facts of this description for those inter- 
ested in or wishing to generalize upon the matter, it will suffice merely te mention 
its far more interesting and important side. 
An attempt is being made to educate a people as a body whose great grandparents 
were African savages or plantation slaves. This people, if uneducated, is hopelessly 
at the mercy of a race far more enlightened and numerous than itself, and, if edu- 
cated, must struggle for existence beside this same more powerful race from which 
it is unmistakably differentiated on the moral side by the hundreds of years of dis- 
ciplining freedom it has yet to undergo, and the absence of self-cffectuation and self- 
restraint, qualities freedom entails, whileon the physical side it is still more unmistak- 
ably differentiated by the color of its skin. To a people thus lightly ballasted with 
independent social experience and racial prestige it is apt to seem that everything is a 
matter of language, and that the ability to talk effectively is an open sesame to every 
avenue of wealth, power, and consideration enjoyed by the dominant race, and that 
success in those avenues is obtained by the verbiage of sophistry rather than by 
patient foresight, and skillful energy.! But by those who wish to secure what 
sanguinary battles and constitutional amendments can not secure, that is to say, the 
abolition of the slavery of ignorance, far different ideas are held. While the State 
has endeavored to do its duty, a warmer effort was long ago inaugurated by the mis- 
sionary enthusiasm of the Christian, and the boundless optimism of the man of 
commerce, to educate teachers for the schools and ministers for the pulpits of the col- 
ored people of the South in order that through their efforts the problems of real life 
might be comprehended by the descendants of the physically emancipated masses 
now located in that portion of the Union.? 
Other than the fact that it is provided for persons of African descent, the education 
of the negro in several of the United States is characterized by three features: (1) Its 
cost is borne almost wholly by the white portion of the community; (2) it is almost 
always elementary; and (3) it is becoming more and more industrial in the sense 
that it is training its pupils in the village industries of carpentry, wheelwrighting, 
blacksmithing, and in the possibly less rural vocations of shoemaking and printing. 
1“'These are the resources with which individual human beings are able to procure the satisfaction 
of their wants and industry comes into being and grows.” (Growth of English Industry and Com- 
merce, vol. 1, p.10. W. Cunningham.) 
*“T desire to state,” says Dr. Haygood in one of his reports, ‘without qualification and as the 
result of long-continued and careful investigation, that the children of parents taught in these higher 
schools in the earlier years of this great movement show at the beginning of their school course 
marked superiority to the children of untaught parents.” 
151
-P-A-G-E-334
1552 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
ITS COST IS BORNE BY THE WHITE RACE. 
  That this is so is natural whether we consider the fact in connection with the schools 
supported by State or municipal taxation or with those supported by the generosity 
of churches or wealthy persons. The Southern States are agricultural, and in an 
agricultural community the great source of revenue is tax upon land. As the land 
in these States is, from the very nature of things, in the possession of the former 
masters, it follows that they are taxed to educate the children of their former slaves. 
Still it would be injustice to the colored race not to go a step farther and inquire by 
whom the agricultural land in the late slave-holding States is putin value; by whom 
it is worked that it will support a tax. The answer may be given in a sentence, a 
universal exodus of the negro would probably not be tolerated in the cotton States. 
Thus it is apparent that there is only a verisimilitude of injustice in the dominant 
and land-holding race educating the youth of the laboring population.! It must be 
remembered, however, that the tax is peculiarly onerous, as there is the necessity of 
supporting two systems of schools. Yet it is only possible to educate colored children 
in this way and the tax is borne with patience. 
But while the Southern States are educating the negro, many persons, under the 
form or direction of religious or special philanthropic bodies, have founded and 
supported institutions which in name are plainly intended for the higher education 
of such colored persons as have the desire to obtain an education of that description. 
It may therefore be said that potentially the best work for the elevation of the colored 
race is done in the so-called colored normal schools, in institutions supported by the 
sale of national lands for the purpose of fostering agricuiture and the mechanic arts, 
and in the upper classes of the numerous ‘‘academies,” ‘ colleges,” and ‘ univer- 
sities” supported by religious bodies or endowed by private individuals. 
As far as known to this Bureau there are 107 of these institutions,? of which 105 
are situated in the Southern States. In them the charge for instruction is exceed- 
ingly low, usually about a dollar or two a month in the normal, academic, and col- 
legiate departments, though frequently it is given without cost. But as low as this 
charge is, when made, it is paralleled by the extremely low rate at which lodging 
and food are furnished and the very moderate incidental fees exacted. In generalit 
may be said that the entire expense to the colored student is in the neighborhood of 
$75 or $100 for a session of nine months. Sometimes it is as low as $50 or $60, some- 
times it is as high as $125 or $150. The lowest of course are the minimum figures at 
which the student can exist. But it must not be supposed that this charge for 
tuition, lodging, and food covers the cost of the presence of the student at any par- 
ticular institution. At Claflin University, for instance, where the entire charge to 
students in the higher grades is about $7.50 a month, it is found “that the small 
amount paid by the students is not sufficient to meet one-tenth of the expenses of 
the institution, and it thus appears that every student is aided to the extent of 
about nine-tenths of his expenses,” that is to say, every student costs the institution 
to instruct, lodge, and feed about $68 a month. At Fisk University ‘‘the charges to 
students do not cover one-half the actual cost of the advantages furnished them.” 
By whom, then, is the cost of these 107 institutions borne? In the case of Claflin 
University it is borne by the contributions of the friends of education, through the 
Freedmen’s Aid and Southern Education Society; by the proceeds of the sale of 
national lands; by the State of South Carolina, and by the John I’. Slater and the 
1“T must yet advert to another most interesting topic—the free schools. In this particular New 
England may bo allowed to claim, I think, a merit of a peculiar character. She early adopted and has 
constantly maintained the principle that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of Govern- 
ment to provide for the instruction of all youth. That which is elsewhere left to chance or charity we 
assume by law. For the purpose of public instruction we hold every man subject to taxation in pro- 
portion to his property, and we look not to the question whether he himself have or have not children 
to be benefited by the education for which he pays. We regard it as a wise and liberal system of 
police by which property and life and the peace of society are secured.” (Daniel Webster, in discourse 
on ‘First Settlement of New England,” December 22, 1820.)

  Peabody funds. In the case of Fisk University the deficit is met by contributions of 
Christian and philanthropic people through the American Missionary Association or 
given directly to the university. Other bodies interested in the work of educating 
the negro are the American Baptist Home Mission Society, which supports many 
institutions; the Presbyterian Church; the Society of Friends; the Congregational 
churches of the North; the Methodist Episcopal Church South.! From these funds 
of religious corporations; from the proceeds of the invested funds of the Peabody, 
and especially of the Slater fund; from the fund in some States arising from the sale 
of lands given by the act of Congress granting lands in 1862, and, in all the States 
insisting on the separation of the two races, a proportional share of the fund annually 
given by the act of August 30, 1890—have been supported the independent schools 
for the education of the negro, with the exception of certain normal schools con- 
ducted by the States and State scholarships created in quasi-independent institutions. 
Lightly, however, as the entire cost of education is made to bear upon the colored 
student, he seems unable to meet it, andseveral expedients have been devised, two of 
which stand forth prominently, at least are of such a nature as to admit of being 
stated in a general way. These are the creation of scholarships and of labor and 
student aid funds,? and it would geem that almost every institution has a fund 
at its disposal to help needy students of merit. Frequently the béneficiary is 
required to perform some kind of service for the amount given, while in some 
cases, as at Berea College, a rebate of $3 a term is allowed to 73 students of gocd 
standing. At Roger Williams and at Fisk universities the student is required 
to contract that he will labor one hour a day for the institution, or pay $2 in addi- 
tion to the charge for board and tuition. As an instance of the necessity of the 
situation, the case of Storer College, at Harpers Ferry, W. Va., may be cited. About 
fifteen years ago it was suggested that from the beauty of its situation it might be 
practicable to use it as a summer resort. One of the teachers made a beginning. 
Visitors came, were charmed by the surroundings, pleased with the bearing of the 
students who waited on them, and sent for their friends, until several hundred 
guests came annually. The earnings of the buildings are about $900, besides 
“bringing into the market certain portions of the school farm.” In the same line is 
the suggestion of the principal of the Alabama State Normal and Industrial School, 
who, after remarking that meritorious young people who would be willing to 
exchange their labor for board are turned away daily, observes that ‘A cotton fac- 
tory or some other industry established near institutions of this [his] kind could 
utilize every extra hour of students, and by some humane arrangement could keep 
running every hour of the day, a source of income to the projectors and an aid to 
poor students.” q 
The scholarships are mostly in the form of State-supported students, and merely 
entitle to free tuition and lodging. Others are merely scholarship funds. Such is 
the King scholarship fund of $5,000, the Cassedy scholarship fund of $10,000, and 
others of equal or less amount possessed by Atlanta University. Biddle University 
has a fund of $6,000, raised in Scotland, the interest of which is to be used to aid 
young men preparing for mission work in Africa. 
The difficulty encountered by the colored student in regard to money has been par- 
tially overcome by the gift of Daniel Hand, esq., of $1,000,000 for the education of 
“such colored people as are needy and indigent.” The fund is administered by the 
American Missionary Society, which, in view of the comparatively inadequate sum 
at its disposal, has felt the necessity of concentrating its resources, as the trustees 
of the two other great educational funds for the education of the people of the 
Southern States have felt the necessity of concentrating theirs.

1554 EDUCATION EEPORT, 1892-93. 
THE EDUCATION OF THE CULORED RACE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY ELEMENTARY. 
  The height of the general intellectual development of the masses is conditioned 
by the affluence or paucity of abstract ideas current among them, at least by the 
ability to quickly acquire such ideas. Unfortunately for the negro his former con- 
dition gave him no opportunity to acquire a great variety of ideas. The relation 
of master and slave, speaking generally, in a sparcely inhabited country gave no 
opening to the negro to obtain a higher order of ideas than his condition required. 
Thus the negro was not trained to take on rapidly that form of enlightenment called 
culture when the opportunity came. The school days of the negro child are not pre- 
ceded by centuries of inheritable stimulus derived from racial, and, as a special case, 
from ancestral exertion, nor is he as yet surrounded by the refining influences of 
evena commonplace home. Voodoo incantations are his only natural literature and 
the permanent literature of the English language, still speaking for the body of the 
race, is without his present sphere. It therefore happens that his education has 
been elementary. 
Many institutions for the education of the negro have high sounding names, but, 
with several exceptions, they are not appropriate. Prominent among these excep- 
tions is Howard University of Washington City? No school for the colored race has 
better facilities for higher education. It has a collegiate, and with the exception 
of the post-graduate, all the professional departments of an American university. 
But by far the most important advantage it has over other institutions of its kind is 
that Washington has had for many years a very efficient system of public schools 
for colored children, which now enroll about 14,000 pupils. It is, therefore, natural 
to suppose, did any general desire exist among the rising generations of colored 
persons to secure a higher culture of the mind than that offered by the elementary 
school, irrespective of any pocuniary advantage to be derived therefrom, that the 
collegiate department of Howard University would be filled, especially since the 
tuition is free and the university buildings practically within the city limits. Yet 
the attendance in the college department of this national university for the African 
is small, being only 7 per cent of the whole attendance of 517. If any effect has been 
produced by the city system of public schools upon the curriculum of Howard Uni- 
versity, it is shown by the absence of an elementary department in that institution. 
However it must be noted that, though the collegiate department is so neglected, the 
professional departments are comparatively well filled. In the normal classes are 
36 per cent of the attendance, in the medical 26 per cent, while the departments of 
theology and law have each more students than the college department proper of 
this university so well supported by Congress, so well officered, and especially, from 
the educational side, so well located.! 
The same phenomenon is shown by other colleges for the higher education of the 
colored race, and it seems warrantable to say that even were the race as a body at 
this moment capable of higher education, its poverty would not permit it, or any con- 
siderable portion of it, to spend the time necessary to acquire such an education, and 
that to educate to a higher degree any considerable portion of the race that portion 
must be supported as the students in colored theological institutions are supported. 
In 1885 an inquiry made of 23 of thé leading institutions for the colored race devel- 
oped the fact that fewer than 5 per cent of the students in those institutions were 
in what is called classical studies, including those preparing for college. An exami- 
nation of the character of the requisites for admission to many of the more or less 
grandly named institutions for the education of the colored race shows that practi- 
cally there are none, except the prerequisite of ability to read in a low grade reader 
or familiarity with the fundamental operations of arithmetic. The elementary English 
course, Says one university, is a necessity, as the large majority of the students com- 
ing to the university have not had the opportunity to ground themselves in the com- 
mon English branches.   
  extent, as those departments, it is understood, have white students upon their rosters.
-P-A-G-E-337
    
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1555. 
In 75 institutions for the education of the colored race, from which special reports 
have been received, there are nearly 20,000 students in nonprofessional courses, not 
quite 4 per cent of whom are reported as being of collegiate grade, 35 per cent as 
being of secondary grade, and 61 per cent as of elementary’ grade. It has been 
remarked above that the absence of an elementary department at Howard University 
may be attributed to the very efficient work of the system of public colored schools 
of Washington City; for the constant complaint of the universities and colleges for 
the colored is that they are obliged to instruct their pupils in the elementary 
branches, showing that if those pupils have been taught in the public schools they 
have been poorly taught or have failed to profit by the teaching. The probability 
is that the child has been poorly taught, and the whole effort of the management of 
two of the three great funds for the education of the populations of the South is the 
training of home teachers. If the efforts of the trustees of these great funds are sup- 
ported by a State system of examination adequate to prevent persons more necessi- 
tous than able from being foisted upon the children, the colleges and universities 
for the colored race may dispense with their elementary classes, though probably 
with a loss of the moiety, or even more, of their present attendance. However this 
may be, those who support the higher named institutions for the education of the 
colored race are fully convinced not only of the negro’s desire and of his capacity for 
culture, but also of the necessity. The only obstacles they can see are illiteracy 
and poverty, which they are striving to overcome by supporting institutions in the 
South as shown above. 
The great majority of the students at these institutions, though pursuing an ele- 
mentary course of instruction, have one of two objects in view. These are the desire 
to become a teacher or a minister of the gospel. Inevéry catalogue of an institution 
for the higher education of the colored race there is to be found either a normal or a 
minister’s course, most frequently both. As for the so-called normal course, it has 
been very accurately stated by the Hartshorn College that itis but the beginning of 
an education, and the instruction in the minister’s course is greatly hampered by the 
lack of asoundeclementary education. Inthe case of the institutions supported by the 
Baptist Home Mission Society, it was decided in 1892 that the instruction in theology, 
except in the case of the Richmond Theological Seminary, be restricted to a minister's 
course especially designed for those lacking an education that would permit them to 
take up the studies of a theological seminary proper. Yet the catalogue of the Rich- 
mond Seminary shows but 27 per cent of its 59 students in the regular theological 
course. In the Gammon Theological Seminary, with a single curriculum which is 
lower than the theological course proper of the Richmond Seminary though higher 
than the minister’s course of that institution, about half the students are unelassi- 
fied or are in special courses. 
The best and highest education given the negro, as far as numbers go, is offered 
in the ubiquitous normal course or department. This course is merely concerned 
with the clements of a plain English mathematical education. The effort there is to 
make the student as far as possible catch the principle involved in the subject under 
consideration rather than to memorize the printed page. Too frequently, perhaps, 
the early training of the student has not made him sufficiently familiar with the 
subject-matter of the elementary branches to enable him to grasp their essence, but, 
notwithstanding this drawback, a thoroughness is given to the instruction that is 
elsewhere lacking. 
The length of the normal course can not be given with any special accuracy. 
What is called the normal course generally requires threo years of study to com- 
plete. Very frequently four years are devoted to the course, and occasionally two. 
In fact, the arrangement given by the Avery Normal Institute, or Straight Univer- 
sity, seems to be practically that of the great majority of the institutions with 
various names for the education of the colored people. At the Avery Institute the 
curriculum begins with the fourth grade and the normal course with the ninth grade 
and continues on through the twelfth and final grade; thus the institution is assim- 
ilable to a graded system of public schools. At Straight University the normal  
-P-A-G-E-338
1556 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  course also begins with the ninth grade, but the eleventh grade, or year, is called 
the middle year of the normal course, and the twelfth grade is called the senior year. 
Instead of grades preparatory, normal and subnormal courses are sometimes estab- 
lished. Still another form of the normal course is shown by the curriculum of this 
Southern university, where the ‘‘normal department contains the high school, the 
freshman year of the college course, and an addition of a course of pedigogics, with 
an emphasis on practice teaching.” Very frequently the normal course is or may 
be used as a preparatory department, while at the branch normal college of the 
Arkansas Industrial University the normal course is stated to be fully equivalent to 
the first two years of aregular college course; and further, that it is the course which 
most of the students content themselves with taking. 
It may be a matter of surprise that institutions necessarily conducted so econom- 
ically as those for the education of the colored race should not be more economical 
in the variety of the courses they offer; in short, that they have not consolidated 
their teaching. It is quite evident that the normal course at its best is merely u 
secondary or preparatory course of study which aims at general intellectual culture 
rather than professional expertness, for it has very frequently elementary Latin and 
Greek, which are distinctively preparatory studies. For the purposes of comparison 
the second and third years of a normal course may be so arranged as to bring out the 
points of similarity it has with the preparatory course of the same institution.

    History of Education. 
The studies of the normal course are determined by the character of the examina- 
tions for State certificates to teach. But as Latin and probably other studies of the 
normal course given above are not pursued far enough to give the pupil any service- 
able teaching knowledge of them, it would seem that they have been introduced for 
the special purpose of culture, and certainly there is no better way to teach ‘‘tech- 
nical” grammar than through the grammar of a synthetic language, such as that of 
ancient Rome. 
Motives of culture, however, are not the ruling ones that induce so many to attend 
the normal schools or departments of the class of institutions under review. Com- 
pletion of a course of study in such a school entitles the holder to a certificate and 
the course itself is especially arranged to meet the requirements of the State exam- 
iners. Though these institutions inculcate the elements of an education, they may 
therefore be looked upon as professional schools. Indeed, to illustrate this con- 
clusion, it will suffice to quote from the catalogue of the school whose programme 
has just been given, where it is said that the normal course has special reference to
-P-A-G-E-339
  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1557 
preparing the student to become a successful teacher, and that it is on that account 
that most of the students naturally turn to it. A university candidly states that a 
majority of its students attend its courses with the expectation of becoming teach- 
ers for a longer or shorter period. 
It is clear that the opportunity opened by State aid and northern philanthropists 
to mature colored persons to gain entry into a field of usefulness of quasi-gentility 
at a small cost in money and a considerable expenditure of time is one thatis partic- 
ularly charming and has great effect in filling the normal schools and departments.! 
“Parents, patrons, and students,” says the Hartshorn Memorial College, ‘‘ must 
remember that the completion of the normal course is but the beginning of educa- 
tion. Well-educated women, prepared for the best service of life, are the product 
of more extended and broader training. It is the desire of this college to develop 
the higher courses as speedily as possible. But instruction in advanced courses can 
be given so far only and so fast as students are prepared to receive it. 
“Yor the successful prosecution of advanced studies, four conditions are—each 
and all—absolutely essential: . 
“(1) There must be natural ability and the love of learning on the part of the 
student. Not a few do well and achieve a good standing in the common-school 
studies, who, for lack of ability or aspiration, utterly fail in the higher. 
(2) There must be careful instruction in the elements and a mastery of them suf- 
ficient to lay a good foundation for after progress. Many pupils pass over the lower 
courses with so much carelessness that they fail, and for lack of preparation must 
needs fail as soon as they touch the higher. 
“(3) Time is requisite. For the primary and grammar school studies, the normal, 
the college preparatory, and the collegiate many years are required. To complete 
long courses of study pupils must begin early and remain in school continuously. 
Those who begin at 16 or 18 years of age have not time to complete advanced 
courses. 
“*(4) Means also for the payment of moderate expenses are required. If the par-

impossible, 
“The pressing needs of the people wait for women of broader education and com- 
pleter discipline. To meet this need Hartshorn Memorial College was founded. 
The time when ability, aspiration for learning, early training, and the requisite 
means shall meet together and render higher education possible ought not to linger. 
The colored people themselves should see that the time does not delay.” 
The foregoing remarks show the lack of higher education among the African race 
in America. This is particularly unfortunate for this portion of the community 
since it, more than any other, requires a body of cultured persons within itself to 
oppose those adventurous persons who, by reason of their pleasing theories or ingen- 
ious arguments, are not apt to be the best of advisers, and in a stable government 
are always bridled by the calm wisdom of a small but all-powerful class of thought- 
ful people. As before remarked, the colored race is located in the distinctively 
agricultural States of the Union. It therefore has neither press nor libraries, and 
the rank and file of the raco must depend upon their leaders for their opinions. 
Thus is explained the pertinacious efforts of thoughtful people to provide a higher 
education for the negro—their efforts to remove the obstacles which his intellectual 
and pecuniary disabilities put in their way, and their appeals for aid. The educa- 
tion of the colored race, as far as it is acquired within the walls of an educational 
1Lest this be misconstrued into a jibe at the colored student it is well to remark thatat the German 
universities it is stated that fully one-fourth of all the students are in needy civcumstances and take 
advantage of the fact to demand aid and enjoy free dinners. (See p.366 of this Report for 1891-92. 
Compare also what is said by Professor Paulsen on p. 288 of the same volume.) Monsieur Dreyfus- 
Brisac, in his Université de Bonn et 1’Enseignement Supérieur en Allemagne, says that the remis- 
sion of fees is frequently unwarranted, and, at the University of Bonn, is modified by a system of 
deferred: payments (stiindung)—over 13 per cent of which are lost.

edifice, is practically elementary; but that fact is by no means conclusive evidence 
that its higher education is an hallucination. 
The systems of public schools supported by States insisting on the separation of 
the races, their work, necessities, and the results accomplished by them, are matters 
of which the public is well informed. Since the report of 1885-86 a portion of this 
annual volume has been devoted to compiling what was known of thesubject, while 
the debates in Congress and the discussions in the public prints have illuminated 
every side of it. The usual figures of attendance, etc., follow.

  Tt will be remarked by the patient reader who examines the table that the white 
pupils show an increase of about 85,000; the colored, a decrease of about 12,000. The 
number of colored teachers has increased 800, while the number of white teachers 
has increased but 700. Were it possible to ascertain what scholastic and personal 
qualifications these 800 new colored teachers bring to their duties the advantages of 
this large increment to the teaching force of colored persons might be discussed. 
In the academies, schools, colleges, etc., for colored youth there are, as far as 
known, 10,191 male and 11,920 female students. In the elementary grades 57 per cent 
of the attendance are girls; in the secondary grades, 53 per cent; while in the col- 
legiate department only 25 per cent are women. In all schools reporting for 1892-93 
there are 25,859 students. In the elementary departments of 75 institutions are 
13,176 pupils; in the secondary are 7,365; in the collegiate, 963, and in the profes- 
sional are 924. 
There aro several questions connected with tho institutional life of the colored 
pupil that deal more particularly with ethics than pedagogics. Under the caption 
of “Separate education.” the authorities of Hartshorn Memorial College observe: 
The establishment of this institution for the education of young women affirms nothing, and 
expr’ 3 no opinion touching the abstract question of coeducation or the separate education of the 
sexes. Hither system, doubtless, has its own special advantages and disadvantages. But this enter- 
prise embodies the conviction that for the students whom this institution will gather, under pres- 
ent conditions and with their present social environment, the balance of advantage is on the side of 
separation. . 
1t is something, and no small matter, that the necessity of unceasing surveillance, by day and by 
night, irritating to pupil and burdensome to teacher, is removed. 
It is something that courses of study and of instruction may be more closely adjusted to the special 
and practical needs of young women. 
‘To those who have seen the conscience broken down, the moral tono deteriorated, habits of duplicity 
engendered, and the best intellects become vapid through the unhealthy life engendered in a mixed 
institution, it will seem animportant matter that ono chief stimulus of this unhealthy life be removed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-341
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1559 
  To fathers and mothers, who remember the sad experiences of some mixed schools, present safety 
for their inexperienced daughters, sent beyond parental watchcare, will, perhaps, outweigh all other 
considerations. 
‘fhe Utopian notion that young people can be brought promiscuously together and counted brothers 
and sisters, human nature laughs to scorn. 
In the presence of such institutions as Mount Holyoke Seminary, Vassar and Wellesley colleges, 
and others of like worth, few would venture to affirm that the highest womanly worth and strength 
is dependent upon walking and talking and reciting for a few years with young men. 
The strong women of this generation, whose hand is upon the sghool work, and the mission work, 
and the reformatory work; and the social life of the time, received their training largely in separate 
schools. 
With the heading ‘‘Coeducation,” the authorities of Bennett College speak with 
equal positiveness to the contrary, as follows: 
After years’ observation and experience we are very decidedly in favor of the education of our young 
people of both sexes in the samo school, provided their association is under proper discipline and suit- 
able care, which we claim is had here. 
‘This is unquestionably, in our judgment, the normal, healthy, home-like method. ‘The improvement 
under theso circumstances in manners, self-reliance, and social culture, the development of manhood 
and womanhood, are often very marked. We know that some parentsare reluctant to send their daugh- 
ters to schools for both sexes; but this apprehension, we believe, arises chiefly from an insufficient famil- 
iarity with the facts. One authority says: ‘Corrupt influences are more liable to abound in schools 
exclusively for either sex, but particularly in separate schools for girls.” ‘To insure modesty,” says 
Richter, “I would advise the education of the sexes together; but I will guarantee nothing in a 
school where girls are alone together, and still less where boys are.” 
  THE EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE INDUSTRIAL. 
In the early efforts for the education of the negro in America the object in view 
was his enlightenment. That point once gained it was thought that his welfare 
would be secure. But owing to his necessitous condition and tho comparatively 
small amount of funds at the disposal of the private or corporate schools, an effort 
was made in a few cases to do what years before had been tried in different parts of 
the Union and found to be a failure in the case of institutions for the Caucasian 
race. This scheme was to have the white student work out his expense while pur- 
suing the studies of the schoolroom, in order that ‘many of our most worthy young 
men, who were deprived of the advantages of an education through poverty,” might 
overcome that obstacle to their ambitions. In the case of the negro the effort has 
persisted longer and has been either more successful than the experiment of 1830-40 
in the North and West, or adventitious circumstances have aided it almost to the 
extent of floating it to an unwonted degree of prosperity. 
From various reasons a wave of industrial training overran the country in the 
later seventies and early cighties that, as a form of education, was adopted by many 
city school systems, but reached its most distinguished development in the manual 
training schools of St. Louis and Chicago. Thescheme of mechanical instruction of 
these schools was not native to America. It had been elaborated in a Russian tech- 
nological university, in which there was a feature of practical work in the engineer- 
ing course, thus bringing it into very sharp contrast with the German type of 
technological university (Technische Hochschule or polytechnicum). But to give 
these advanced engineering students of scientific technology a practical insight into 
the processes by which the mechanics whom they were in the future to direct must 
work out in wood or metal their ideas as engineers, a course of instruction was 
established which in America was, in the early days of its adoption, called the Rus- 
sian system of manual training. The anarchy of shopwork for profit on the prin- 
ciples of the mechanico-theological or classical schools for poor students of the 
thirties was now superseded by a well-digested and systematic plan of mechanical 
instruction without profit. Now, the work of the negro has been much more closely 
connected with the old mechanico-theological idea than with the Russian system, 
though the introduction of drawing and machinery gave it dignity as a plan of 
instruction. This, however, it acquired by the action of the Slater fund trustees.
-P-A-G-E-342
    1560 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The systematic instruction of the colored race in the village industries is insepa- 
rably connected with the administration of the John F. Slater fund. It was not 
particularly Mr, Slater who caused the fund to be used to foster trade teaching, but 
his trustees; for the “general object” of his deed of gift, ‘to be exclusively pur- 
sued,” was the uplifting of the lately emancipated population of the Southern States 
and their posterity by conferring upon them the blessings of a Christian education— 
education in which the instruction of the mind in the common brinches of secular 
learning shall be associated with training in just notions of duty toward God and 
man in the light of the Holy Scripture. Though the methods of accomplishing this 
was left to the discretion of the trustees, Mr. Slater strongly indicated that in his 
opinion the training of teachers was the method to be adopted. In a private con- 
versation with Dr. Haygood, however, he put industrial training as the sixth (and 
last) object to be taken into consideration in the use of the interest of the fund 
‘known by his name. It should be remarked, however, that the trustees may have 
been influenced in the concentration of the fund upon industrial training by the fact 
that the Peabody fund had for some years been steadily concentrating its resources 
on the training of teachers, and the States were making provision to supply their 
colored schools with properly qualified persons. Be this as it may, the trustees of 
the fund early determined to confine its aid to such schools as were best fitted to 
prepare young colored men and women to become useful to their race, and that insti- 
tutions which gave instruction in trades and other manual occupations that would 
enable colored youths to make a living and to become useful citizens be carefully 
sought out and preferred. This policy was continued ten years. 
At the date of 1883 the highest example of industrial or trade teaching of the 
negro was Hampton Normal and Industrial School. Only a few of the higher grade 
schools for colored youth had attempted to teach trades. Many of the most experi- 
enced persons in the field were not convinced that it was wise to attempt it; 
others advocated it. The rudimentary character of this instruction may be inferred 
from the first reports to the agent of the fund, Dr. Haygood. Clark University 
reports, ‘‘ Without the aid of the Slater fund ($2,000) we could have done little in 
the industrial department, as it required $1,100 to equip it, and our printing depart- 
ment would have failed entirely.” Tuskegee Normal School reports, ‘For the 
impetus given to the industrial department the school is chiefly indebted to the 
John F. Slater fund.” Claflin University remarks, ‘‘As soon as we received notice 
of the appropriation of $2,000 from the Slater fund arrangements were made to erect 
a suitable carpenter shop.” And so on, to a large extent, with a score of institutions 
aided by the fund. Yet these institutions had been carefully sought out as the best 
for being aided in this matter of trade instruction. It is beyond a doubt that the 
efficient cause of the impetus for industrial education of the negro was given by the 
management of the Slater fund and the enthusiasm of their late agent, now Bishop 
Haygood. 
On the retirement of Dr. Haygood the plan of the distribution of the Slater fund 
was somewhat changed. The trustees created a board of education, of which Dr. 
Curry, the agent of the Peabody fund, was made chairman. The new plan of oper- 
ation advocated neither the teaching of trades nor the support of institutions not 
on a “permanent basis.” Instead of the teaching of this or that trade the teaching 
of the ‘underlying principles of all trades” and the employment of persons expert 
in imparting such instruction was to be kept in view; and the schools are already 
beginning to follow the hint thus given. The act of Congress of August 30, 1890, 
for the benefit of schools established for the advancement of education in agricul- 
ture and the mechanic arts, very likely has had, or will have, the effect to foster 
this idea of preventing the petrifaction of the negro into a village mechanic or 
farm laborer while directing his thoughts and impulses toward industrial rather 
than political spheres of activity. As the State and the Peabody fund may be looked 
to to promote the training of teachers, the Slater fund and the $10,000 or $12,000
-P-A-G-E-343
      
  EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1561 
  annually given to the States thickly populated with negroes, for their industrial 
education, may be looked to to supply men capable of conducting an industrial bus- 
iness. It has been through the avenues of trade that an inferior people rise to a 
higher condition. Trade brings wealth, wealth leisure, and leisure the opportunity, 
if not the desire, for culture. 
As taught in the schools for the colored race about the year 1893, the industrial 
instruction had the following forms, to wit: The manual training or education by 
work idea; trade teaching of the mechanic trades; agriculture; printing; and, for 
girls, housework, including sewing and nurse training 
At Tougaloo University, in accordance with the general plan of the Slater fund, a 
change was recently made in the form of the industrial work, especial attention 
being given to manual training with a view to the general culture of mind and 
hand. This change consisted in the establishment of a two-years course of wood- 
work of an hour to an hour and a half a day for the seventh and eighth grades, 
covering the processes and principles of working in wood and with woodworking 
tools. The exercises are graded, running from the simple to the more difficult, the 
aim being to adapt them to the mental capacity of the student as well as to his 
dexterity, and to make them a helpful part of his school work. Each student has a 
blue print of his work before him. A course in woodwork adapted to the fifth and 
sixth grades, and a course in ironwork for the ninth grade, is to follow it, while for 
the tenth and eleventh grades a course of mechanical drawing is to be provided. 
Straight University also has felt the Slater impetus toward a more concentrated 
method of manual instruction, and has likewise established a two-years course in 
woodwork for the seventh and eighth grades, with the same features of the course at 
Tougaloo University. In fact, the course as explained by Tougaloo and worked out 
in the following programme may be considered as the Slater course of manual 
training: 
Seventh grade (limited to square work).—Planing to a true surface; laying out 
work (including measuring with the rule and marking with knife and gauge); saw- 
ing to the line; boring; gluing; driving nails and screws; sandpapering; making 
box joint, dado, mortise, tenon, and groove. 
Eighth grade (especially bended or curved work),.—Making miter joint (square, 
octagon, and hexagon); regular and irregular bevels (using steel square); scarf 
joint, dovetail; laying out curved work; planing and chiseling curved surfaces; 
sawing curved lines; bending by sawing and steaming; making round forms. 
At Fisk University, after the manual training course of two years has been com- 
pleted the ‘‘principles” inculeated are applied during a third year in building and 
cabinetmaking, while during both the second and third years the nature and use of 
paints, varnishes, stains, and polishes are taught. In addition to the aid from the 
Slater fund aid was also received from the Daniel Hand fund in establishing this 
“new line” of work. It will be seen that the remunerative or practical feature has 
not been disregarded at this university. At several institutions supported in part 
by the proceeds from the sale of public lands belonging to the United States and at 
the comparatively well endowed Atlanta University quite ambitious efforts are being 
made to inaugurate a system of practical technological instruction much above the 
average for colored schools. Indeed, at Central Tennessee College there is a conrso 
of study in mechanical engineering of four years, though no one has availed himself 
of it. 
But the form of manual training that has been in vogue in the independent or 
isolated schools for the negro in the past has been of quite another form. The insti- 
tutions giving this instruction drew their aid from the revenues provided by gen- 
erous persons interested in the welfare of the negro, and as their attendance increased 
quite frequently their classes in carpentry and in bricklaying, and in agriculture 
were utilized in building new and in enlarging or repairing old structures, or in 
working the fields for garden produce, Sometimes the blacksmithing and wheel- 
          
-P-A-G-E-344
1562 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
wrighting of the neighborhood was done; but in general it may be said that the 
work of the trade classes had a double object in view—instruction of the pupils, and 
the enlargement or repair of the institution or the cultivation of its grounds. Not 
that the object of the institution was at all inercenary, but because that was about 
the only way in which any remuneration could be gotten by the institution out of 
the labor of its students; if not in this way, then failure. 
This species of manual instruction is of varied nature: Carpentry, bricklaying and 
brickmaking, blacksmithing, painting, and printing for men; cooking, dressmaking, 
and in general housewifery for women. I¢ is doubtful if a better illustration of 
this object, and methods of the institution giving this character of instruction, can 
be found than the following announcement: 
INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS. 
  ‘The industrial work is carried on in connection with a four years’ course of academic work designed 
to give a thorough English education. With these objects are kept in view, viz: 
(1) To teach the dignity of labor. 
(2) To teach tho students how to work, giving them a trade when thought best. 
(3) To cnable students to pay a portion of their expenses in labor. 
At presont the most developed of the industries are: 
Agriculture.—This department controls two farms of 680 and 800 acres, respectively. The funds at 
command will not allow much outlay in new experimental farming. The special effort, therefore, 
is to give tho students lessons in common, practical farming. The farms not only furnish an object 
lesson and valuable employment to students, but supply largely the demands of the school. 
Brickmaking.—On the farm have been found extensive beds of clay suitable for making bricks. 
From these beds the school has been able to make bricks enough to build five substantial buildings for 
school uses, and to sell many to neighbors. The bricks are made and laid by students, thus reducing 
the cash outlay for buildings to the minimum. 
Carpentry.—The students are taught to do all kinds of work, such as building cottages, fences, 
repairing buildings, making and repairing furniture, etc. Of the many buildings on the grounds, 
work has been done by boys of this department. 
—Painting of buggies and graining are emphasized. House painting is regularly done. 
Many buggies and carts for the town and country are brought in and painted. 
Printing.—In this office are printed the catalogues, ‘‘ Southern Letter,” ‘‘ Student,” and much job 
work for the school and the surrounding country. 
Blacksmithing and wheehwrighting.—These departments do all the work for the school and farm, 
and much for the town’ and country. 
Tinsmithing, shoemaking, and harness making.—Harness work for the neighborhood, as well as for 
the school farm, is done. The students’ shoes are repaired and all the roofing of the institution is 
done. 
Sawmill.—One of the most useful of the industrial occupations is that in connection with the saw- 
mill. A largo part of the farm is covered with pine forest. 
Wages.—’The rate of wages is according to the age of the student and the real value of his work. 
The arrangements aro such that students lose nothing in their classes by working out a part of their 
expenses. At tho end of each month a bill is given to every student showing what he may owe the 
school or what the school may owe him.   
      A very favorable statement of the condition of trade teaching is given by Howard 
University. There the industrial department occupies an entire building, 40 by 
75 feet, of two stories and basement, and the students in the preparatory and 
normal departments practice in the methods of certain trades at specified hours. 
The work in each department is done under the personal direction of askilled work- 
man, and with the advantage of first-class tools. 
Before leaving the subject of trade teaching in the isolated schools for the colored 
race it isnecessary that certain remarks of Dr. Haygood, in his last report (1891) 
to the trustees of the Slater fund, should be reproduced. They are as follows: 
“Tf there had been no Slater fund, much by this time would have been done in 
industrial education in these schools; but every informed person knows that the 
help and encouragement of this great benevolence has furnished the inspiration and 
driving force of this vital movement. But for the friendship won to some of these 
schools through the industries fostered by the Slater money they would, by this

time, have ceased to be. * * * For every dollar given by the Slater fund not 
only another dollar has come to help it but more than a dollar.” : 
Tho large farms usually attached to the institutions for the colored race, the indus- 
trial habitudes of that race, and the terms of the act of August 30, 1890, have invited 
or compelled attention to agricultural operations. The difficulties attending the 
introduction of this study in schools for the whites were greater than in the case of 
the schools for the colored; indeed the training given by the agricultural courses of 
the schools for colored persons has been much more adapted to making laborers 
than scientific agriculturists. 
For colored girls the usual manual training given to white girls is quite appropri- 
ate. Cooking and dressmaking are particularly well adapted as studies to those who 
very frequently make their living as servants or seamstresses. Quite an effort is 
being made to introduce nurse training and in several institutions courses have been 
established, as at Central Tennessee College where arrangements have been made 
for a course consisting of two parts, one, nonprofessional, of two years, and one, 
professional, running through a third year. 
THE TEACHING FORCE, 
  The biographies of the teachers in the institutions for the education of the colored 
race would be a detailed history of the struggle for the instruction of that race. It 
has never happened in the history of education that so many difficulties had to be 
overcome as in the case of carrying the war for education into Africa, and it was 
natural, perhaps necessary, that enthusiasm should ripen into devotion, and even 
fortify itself in fanaticism, But the personal trials and victories of the past and 
present can not be recounted here; they must be looked for in Dr. Barnard’s report 
on education in the District of Columbia, in General Armstrong’s Twenty Years of 
Work at Hampton, and in other works of a similar nature. 
After the lapse of a quarter of a century, it isnatural to suppose that much of the 
teaching done in schools for the colored race should be by persens from among them- 
selves. The figures from 76 institutions justify such an expectation, for they show 
that of the 1,010 teachers in them one-third (373) are colored men and women, Still 
confining attention to the institutions for the education of the colored race, it appears 
that, though the white men teachers (225) are equal in number to the colored men 
teachers (221), the white women teachers (412) are very nearly as many as both 
white and colored men teachers, while for every colored woman teacher there are 
3 white women teachers. Comparison with the relative proportion of each sex in 
the public schools can not be made, as the statistics are not obtainable, but it may 
bo stated as a fact that in cities the colored schools are almost always taught by 
women, and in the open country by men.

1564 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
The education, of these teachers has been accomplished in the various normal 
schools, academies, colleges, and universities spoken of some pages back. The coun- 
try schools are incapable of giving an education that will at all qualify the pupil for 
the position of a teacher of even a colored school, and unless there be a high schoo 
in the city having a quasi system of schools for their colored population the urban 
public school is also incapable of accomplishing the same fact. The strenuous efforts 
now being made to improve the character of the white teaching corps by uniform 
examinations will probably result in securing a higher grade of teachers for the 
schools for the rural districts, in which the negro population is mostly situated, and 
better supervision will result in more thorough teaching and more businesslike man- 
agement. 
There are three great funds, aggregating $4,000,000, the interest of which may be 
used in promoting the education of persons to fill positions as public-school teachers 
in the Southern States. Two of these funds are specifically for the colored race and 
the other is for the people of the whole South. In addition to these, there is the 
fund arising from the sale of lands given by Congress in 1862, which generally reaches 
the normal schools for colored pupils in the form of a State appropriation, and 
finally there is the quota, fixed by Federal law, drawn from the $25,000 annually 
appropriated to each State by the act of Congress of August 30, 1890, which has so 
far gone to help the resources of the State normal schools for colored children which 
are thus compelled to add an industrial feature to their establishment. But most 
important of all, since it is extensible and therefore may be made commensurate with 
the necessities of the situation, is an appropriation from the State treasury, a 
resource which has been very effectively used in the North and West, and is by no 
means unknown in the South. 
PROFESSIONAL TRAINING. 
  The dignity and the presumptive emoluments of the professions of law and medi- 
cine and the sacredness and the social influence of the minister’s calling have natu- 
rally excited a desire in many colored persons to engage in a course of study leading 
to one of the so-called learned professions. The difficulty experienced in America 
by the schools for instruction in the learned professions is intensified in the case of 
those for the colored citizen, for very few of their students are scholastically prepared 
to follow the study they have chosen. This subject, however, is so well worn in the 
case of the schools for the whites that it would be intolerable to have its intricacies 
unfolded in connection with a few schools for training the men who are to deal with 
the life, the property, and the morals of an inferior race that has been forced rather 
than self-evolved to a plane of theoretic highest civil standing. 
In the late slayeholding States there are five schools for the medical education of 
persons of color. At one of these—that at Washington--some white persons attend, 
while at the Northern schools for the Caucasian race a number of colored persons 
are enrolled. 
Three institutions are very prominent in the training of physicians for the colored 
people. These are the Meharry medical department of Central Tennessee College, 
Howard University medical department, and the Leonard medical department of 
Shaw University. The Meharry medical department was organized in 1876-1879, 
through the generosity of the Messrs. Meharry, of Indiana. At that time there was 
no institution south of the Ohio and the Potomac accessible to the colored race. The 
Leonard Medical School was established in 1881-82 upon a site given by the State of 
North Carolina. Both of these Southern institutions have received very substantial 
aid from the John F. ‘Slater fund. The medical department of Howard University 
was the first medical school for colored students, It issupported partly by the funds 
of the university and partly by tuition fees, which are increased by the attendance of 
white persons who are attracted by the low annual charge for tuition and the excel- 
lent instruction and facilities for instruction provided. At Fisk University ‘it is

  hoped that the time is very near at hand when departments of law and medicine 
can be added to the present lines of educational work of the university.” 
The course of the schools attached to Howard and New Orleans universities and 
Central Tennessee College are graded, and are of four years. At Shaw University an 
annual course of lectures is given. The first three institutions named require pro- 
ficiency in an English education, all having examinations for admission Central 
Tennessee College and New Orleans University require the student to study Latin 
during the junior year. The curriculum of the graded courses comprises anatomy, 
physiology, microscopy, histology, chemistry, toxicology, materia medica, therapéu- 
tics, obstetrics, gynecology, pediatrics, practice, hygiene, medical jurisprudence, 
ophthalmology, otology, and bacteriology, the difference in the distribution of the 
studies through the four years being that at the New Orleans University and Central 
Tennessee College the student’s attention is confined to anatomy, chemistry, and 
physiology, while at Howard University physiology, materia medica, therapeutics, 
microscopy, and histology are introduced. A further difference is also apparent in 
the placing of the practice of medicine and surgery, which are third-year studies at 
Howard and fourth-year at the other two institutions. Howard University has upon 
its own grounds a well-filled hospital. The students of the Central Tennessee College 
department may attend the Nashville City Hospital. All the schools have clinics. 
The requirements for graduation are completion of the twenty-first year, of the 
course of the school, and the payment of fees in full. The fees are $30 or $60 a year. 
At New Orleans University and Central Tennessee College the entire course of four 
years costs the student $173; at Howard University $223, including all incidental 
expenses connected with instruction. 
Connected with several of these schools are departments of dentistry or phar- 
macy. The course of the dental departments of Howard University and Central 
Tennessee College is of three years. The curriculum comprises anatomy, physiology, 
microscopy, histology, chemistry, materia medica, therapeutics, surgery, operative 
and prosthetic dentistry, hygiene, and medical jurisprudence, to which Central 
Tennessee adds metallurgy, dissecting, and materia medica. The expenses are $30 
or $60 a year and incidentals. 
Three institutions have coursesin pharmacy. That of Howard University comprises 
botany, chemistry, toxicology, materia medica, and pharmacy, with a recommenda- 
* tion to study microscopy, which Central Tennessee includes as necessary. To gradu- 
ate, the student must have attended two years, but to obtain the degree of graduate 
in pharmacy he must have had two other years of practical experience in compound- 
ing and dispensing drugs and medicines in a regular established pharmacy. The 
charge at Central Tennessee College and Shaw University is $30 annually, not 
including incidentals; at Howard University, $60. 
Among the colored people the study of law has not such a numerous following as 
the study of medicine. The same phenomenon is present among the Caucasian race 
of European and American countries, for the impetus given to the public mind by 
successful biological research and the ills attending a high-pressure system of life 
have rendered medical assistance advisable as an experiment and even necessary for 
continued existence. 
There are five schools of law especially for colored people. These schools are all 
connected with a college or university. By far the largest enrollment is in the law 
department of Howard University, which, holding its sessions at night, gives oppor- 
tunity to colored clerks and messengers of the public bureaus and to commercial 
clerks to undertake a course in law. The three schools of the national capital for 
the whites offer the same advantages to persons of that color whose necessities and 
ambition oblige them to work and study by day and recite or listen to lectures at 
night. 
The law department of Howard University has been fortunate. It has recently 
been supplied with a remodeled building opposite the city court-house, through the   
-P-A-G-E-348
1566 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  generosity of certain members of the New York bar and of C. P. Huntington and 
J. W. Ambrose, both of New York, and has been named Evarts Hall in recognition 
of the exertions of the Hon. William M. Evarts in procuring funds for the recon- 
struction of the old building. It is also fortunate in having Congress, which legis- 
lates for the District of Columbia, provide in part for the salaries of four professors— 
in all, $3,200. 
The course of study of this school is not of an advanced character. It is taken for 
granted that the applicant for admission “has had a good English education and 
some mental training.” But though no preliminary examination is held, that fact 
“is not to be construed as in any manner lowering the standard of attainments 
required for graduation,” as preliminary examinations are frequently found to work 
injustice and are unsatisfactory, The course is of two years plus the post-graduate 
course tacked on to all the law-school courses established in Washington. ‘The first 
year is spent on Blackstone, real and personal property, contracts, commercial paper, 
criminal law, and domestic relations; the second on pleading, practice, equity, 
evidence, and torts. During the third year constitutional limitations on the States, 
mercantile law, and corporations are taken up. Moot courtsare held. The instruc- 
tion is by the usual assigned reading and quiz method, interspersed with lectures. 
The faculty is composed of six lecturers. 
The law department of Central Tennessee College has a course of two years. To 
gain admission to its course the candidate must pass a satisfactory examination on 
all the common English studies, and is advised to take a more extensive course of 
general study before beginning that of law. The course differs from that of How- 
ard University in that the study of the fundamental divisions of the substantive 
law share during the first year the time with the law of procedure, and international 
Jaw (Vattel) is introduced, while during the second year Federal procedure, consti- 
tutional limitations, and corporations are taken up and procedure law continued. 
The faculty is composed of threo persons and a dean. 
The law department of Allen University has a course of two years, whose sessions, 
like the schools at Washington, D. C., are held in the afternoon and evening, in order 
to suit the convenience of students otherwise employed during the earlier portion of 
the day. The first year is, with the exception of evidence, devoted to substantive 
law (Blackstone, Kent, contracts, and bills), and to constitutional law. The second 
year is, with the exception of criminal law and the statutory law of South Carolina, 
devoted to procedure, considering equity as falling in that category. The faculty 
appears to be the president of the university. Moot courts are held. During the six 
years of its existence five classes have been sent out, ‘‘a majority of the members 
meeting with a great degree of success in life.” 
The law school of Shaw University was established in 1888. Its course is not 
known. A scholarship of $50 a year will be granted to worthy students who need 
assistance. 
Wilberforee University has a law course of two years, but no students. 
“Tf you were in a Southern village watching the passers-by, you would perhaps 
see among them a colored man, strong in body, marked in countenance, an umbrella 
in one hand and a gripsack in the other. He is always well, always possessed of 
marvelous powers of endurance, always ready to speak. He is the negro preacher. 
Examine him and you will find he has never been taught. * * * Is he doing 
much preaching? He is preaching a good deal. He has been at it twenty-five 
years. Multitudes are swayed by his cloquence. Men’s, women’s, and children’s 
Tives and careers are subject to him. He is often the only colored man among them 
who canread: He is tlie one man who is looked up to asa Jeader. His influence 
extends to the utmost limit of the colored people’s life. Here, then, is the colored 
minister, with many admirable qualities, but with certain deficiencies. Iere he is. 
What ought he todo? He ought to be educated. He ought to undergo a grand 
work in the three R’s, he ought to understand English, the English Bible, English’
-P-A-G-E-349
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 1567 
literature, English history, English doctrine, to speak and to write English, and to 
explain the Bible in English.” ! 
In August, 1892, the presidents of the schools supported by the Baptist Home Mis- 
sion Society adopted the following scheme: All students studying for a degree to 
study at Richmond Theological Seminary, and each school of the society to have a 
“minister’s course ”: 
This course is designed only for those who, from lack of literary training, are unable to take a 
more extended course, and who, at the same time, are unable, by reason of ago and other insurmount- 
able conditions, to secure a thorough literary training. Many ministers engaged in active pastoral 
work who feel the need of further training will find this course specially adapted to their case. It 
may, ordinarily, be completed in a year. No person will be allowed to pursue this course in the 
Richmond ‘Theological Seminary except residents of the State of Virginia. Certificates will be given 
to such as complete the conrse in a satisfactory manner. The instruction to be given is to be included 
under the following heads: 
I.—STUDY OF THE ENGLISH BIBLE. 
  ‘The work done under this head is to be strictly Biblical. No time is to be spent upon speculations 
about tho Bible. The study of Divino truth itself and the best methods of communicating this 
truth to the minds and hearts of others are to occupy the entire attention. The inductive method 
of instruction is to be pursued, and the special aim of the work is to accomplish the following ends: 
(a) To permeate the minds and hearts of the students with the spirit and power of Divine truth. 
(0) ‘Lo give to the students a general but comprehensive knowledge of the Bible as a whole. 
(©) To impart to the students a correct method of studying the Scriptures, and practical and effee- 
tivo methods of conveying Bible truth to the minds and hearts of other persons varying in age, 
capacity, and mental training. 
In secking to accomplish these three ends in the most successful manner, the following order of 
study and of imparting instruction is to be pursued: 
(1) The study and application of (a) Bible stories, () Bible characters, (c) consecutive Bible narra- 
tive or history. 
(2) Tho study of principles and methods of giving Bible instruction. This exercise includes (a) 
the study of subjects specially selected, (b) parables, (c) miracles, ete. 
(8) Tho study of the lifo of Christ, making the gospel of Luke the basis of instruction. 
(4) The study and analysis of selected topics and selected books of the Bible. 
(5) The systematic study of Bible doctrines as explicitly taught in the Bible itself. 
  Il.—FAMILY ORGANIZATION. 
Under this head the teachings of the Bible in reference to the family are to be carefully studied and 
enforced in a practical way. The following order is pursued: 
(1) The teachings of the New Testament upon marriage. 
(2) The Scripture teachings regarding the reciprocal duties and responsibilities of husband and 
wife. 
(3) Tho Scripture teachings in referenceto the relation of parents and children. (a) The father’s position in the family and his special responsibilities; (b) the mother’s position and her responsibiii- 
ties; (c) home surroundings, what they should be, and how to make them such; (d) The children in 
the home, and their duties and responsibilities to their parents and to each other. 
(4) Rights, duties, and responsibilities of employers and employees as taught in the Word of God. 
IM.—CHURCH WORK. 
In this department instruction is to be given on everything that pertains to a well-organized work- 
ing church. 
Special attention will be given to the peculiar needs of small country churches and mission 
stations. ‘The instruction is to be of the most practical nature. It is to be accompanied also by such 
church work upon the part of the students as will fix it firmly in theirminds. ‘The following presents 
the order of study and instruction: 
(1) ‘Tho nature of church organization as taught in the New Testament: (a) ‘Tho elder, bishop, 
presbyter, minister, or pastor—his office, his qualification, and his duties and responsibilities, both 
privato and public; (b) tho deacons, their office, qualifications, and duties; (c) deaconcsses, their place 
and work in the church; (d) church members, their relations to the minister or pastor, also to each other, and their special work and responsibilities; (e) church order and discipline. 
(2) Church helps as a part of church organization: (a) All helps are to be regarded as subordinate 
to tho church itself; () societies, Christian association, young people's union, Christian endeavor 
society, literary society, home and foreign missionary society, mission circle, mission band and tem- perance society, ete.

Presbyterian Church, in Second Mohonk Conference, pp. 33-35.
-P-A-G-E-350
  1568 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
(8) ‘Cho Bible Sunday school as the training school of tho church: (a) Methods of organizing such 
a school; (b)-the officers and teachers, their qualifications, duties and responsibilities, and relation of 
their work to the church; (c) the home school, and tho pastor's relation to it; (d) mission schools, 
their organization and management, and their relations to the church; (e) teachers’ meetings, how 
best conducted; (f) methods of instructing and managing Bible classes, intermediate classes, and 
primary classes. IV.—MISSIONARY WORK. 
The training in this department is to be strictly practical. ‘Tho principle “To do is to know” is to 
be carefully applied. Whilo a knowledge of the best methods of doing missionary work is regarded 
as very important, actual practice in doing the work is regarded as still more important. Without 
this latter the former will be of little value, and the training given will be very defective. This 
practical work, during the school year, is to receive special attention, and will be under the special 
direction of the teachers. In addition to this practical work, each student will also be required to 
pursue a systematic courso of missionary reading. ‘This course is to include a careful selection of 
works on the history and progress of missionary effort and a wide range of biographical sketches 
of eminent and successful home and foreign missionaries of the Baptist and other denominations. 
The foregoing is to be hereafter the maximum theological course for each of the home mission 
schools, except the Richmond Theological Seminary. The president of each school may, however, 
exercise his discretion in omitting from this course such portions of the work as he may deem 
necessary in the interest of the class of students who receive instruction.    
The full course at the Richmond Theological Seminary includes Hebrew, Greek, 
Biblical introduction, English interpretation, Biblical theology and ethics, church 
history, homiletics, psychology, and moral philosophy, and is in short a regular 
theological seminary, having a course of four years such as was described in the 
report of this Bureau for 1890-91. 
Other schools have courses ranging from two to five years, but generally of three, 
with the omission of Hebrew and Greek, with the exception of Wilberforce Univer- 
sity, which has bothin its “regular course ;” Gammon Theological Seminary, which 
has both elective except for candidates for a degree, and Howard University, which 
has both in its “classical course of theology.” 
Several missionary courses have been established. That of the Central Tennessee 
College is called a “‘ Training school for Africa.” 
There is no charge for tuition in these institutions, and it is believed that lodging 
isalso free. Atthe Gammon Seminary eight cottages have been erected for the use of 
married students, and at this school and at others loans and gifts are made to desery- 
ing students.

CHAPTER V. 
PECUNIARY AID FOR STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITIES AND 
COLLEGES. 
  It is a well-known fact that students in universities and colleges contribute but a 
very small proportion of the funds necessary to carry on these institutions. The 
comparatively low rates of tuition demanded by them are rendered possible by the 
Jarge permanent endowment funds obtained from various sources, and by the annual 
appropriations made by the several States and by the United States Government. 
The endowment funds are frequently given for certain specified purposes, such as the 
endowment of professorships, fellowships, scholarships, or some particular depart- 
ment of an institution, while in other cases the disposition of the funds is left to the 
discretion of the institutions receiving them. 
In 1892-93 the income from the productive funds of universities al colleges 
reported to this Bureau was $5,099,859, or 34.9 per cent of the total income for the 
year. The amount received from the tuition fees of students was $5,466,810, or 37.4 
per cent of the total amount. The balance of the income was made up from State 
or United States appropriations, and from miscellaneous sources. Nearly all of the 
appropriations are given to State universities, and, as a rule, tuition in these insti- 
tutions is free, at least to students from the respective States. 
Aid to students is given in various forms—by means of fellowships, scholarships, 
remission of tuition fees, and by loans and prizes. 
Both in this country and in Europe fellowships are given to students who have 
already obtained at least a baccalaureate degree, or can show that they have 
received an education corresponding to that indicated by the possession of such 
degree. In the United States and in France fellowships are given to students who 
desire to pursue advanced courses of instruction, and as a rule the beneficiaries must 
study at the institutions furnishing the aid. In France the aid is given by the State, 
and the recipients must, with few exceptions, pursue their studies at one of the 
faculties. Some of the fellowships are, however, for use as traveling fellowships; 
particulars are given in connection with the several institutions on the following 
pages. 
The number of fellowships in the United States is increasing rapidly, at present 
numbering about 265, An examination of the catalogues of universities and col- 
leges shows that probably the oldest fellowship, founded as such, in the United 
States is the Harris fellowship at Harvard University, which was founded in 1868 
by William Minot, jr., as executor of Henry Harris, with an original endowment of 
$10,000. 
The first traveling fellowship at Harvard was founded by the Hon. George Ban- 
croft in 1871. It may be of interest to note that Mr. Bancroft was the first Harvard 
graduate that was sent to Germany for study by the university. He went to Got- 
tingen in 1818 and pursued his studies in Europe for three years. In his letter of 
July 4, 1871, to President Eliot, of Harvard, apprising him of his desire and intention 
of founding a fellowship, Mr. Bancroft says: 
A little more than fifty-three years ago Edward Everett, then Eliot professor of 
Greek literature, in one of his letters to President Kirkland developed the idea that 
1573
-P-A-G-E-356
1574 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  it would be well to send some young graduate of Harvard to study for a while at a 
German university with a view to his being called to a place on the college board. 
. The president approved his suggestion, and his choice for this traveling scholarship 
fell upon me. Accordingly, inthe early summer of 1818, being then inmy eighteenth 
year, I proceeded to Géttingen. After remaining more than three years in Europe I 
returned to Cambridge, where I held the office of tutor for one year. There being 
no opening for a permanent connection with the university, I devoted a few years to 
an attempt to introduce among us some parts of the German system of education, so 
as to divide more exactly preliminary studies from the higher scientific courses and 
thus facilitate the transformation of our colleges into universities after the plan 
‘everywhere adopted in Germany. But it is not easy to change an organization that 
has its roots in the habits of the country, and the experiment could not succeed, for 
it was impossible to introduce the German usage which permits students to pass 
freely from a private place of instruction to a public one, without the exaction of 
payments for instruction elsewhere received. 
I then applied through the late Judge Charles Jackson, a member of the cor- 
poration and a friend of mine, for leave to read lectures on history in the university. 
At Géttengen or at Berlin I had the right, after a few preliminary formalities, to 
deliver such a course. It was the only time in my life that I applied for an office for 
myself, and this time it was not so much an office as a permission that I desired. 
My request was declined by my own alma mater; so that I had not the opportunity 
of manifesting my affection for her by personal services; and my life has had, in 
consequence, unexpected variety and independence. But wherever my lot has been 
thrown I have always preserved in freshness and strength the love which I bore to 
Harvard College in my youth; and now, in my old age, I still gladly seek an oppor- 
tunity of proving that attachment. 
I wish, therefore, to found a scholarship on the idea of President Kirkland, that 
the incumbent should have leave to repair to a foreign country for instruction. 
Merit must be the condition of the election to the scholarship; no one is to be elected 
who has not shown uncommon ability, and uncommon disposition tolearn. Ofcourse 
the choice should fall on someone who needs the subsidy. 
You, sir, as the successor of Dr. Kirkland, may know the funds out of which came 
the modest but sufficient stipend which I received; and if so, I leave it to you and 
the corporation to impose any limitations that youthinkright. Otherwise, residence 
at the university, but not for more than three years, may be required. But the res- 
idence should have reference to any of the schools of divinity, law, or medicizie, or 
of mines, or of science, or of any other school that is or may be founded, not less 
than to the classes of the undergraduates. I think, in an exceptional case, there 
should be authority to name the scholar from any place, without any previous res- 
idence at Cambridge; and if you and the corporation approve, I wish it to be so 
established. 
The scholarship should be held by no one for more than three years, and during 
that time should be renewed from year to year; but only on evidence that the scholar 
is fulfilling the purpose of the endowment. I Jeave to you and to the corporation to 
circumscribe, if, from the considerations already referred to, you think best, the 
objects of study to which the incumbent should devote himself: But, for my own 
part, I am willing the scholarship should be given to any young person: likely to 
distinguish himself in either of the learned professions, or in any branch of science, 
or in architecture, sculpture, painting, music, or letters. 
* * * * * * 
    One word more. The incumbents of the scholarship may perhaps be afterwards 
drawn into the corps of professors at the university. Should they render no such 
service, and should they be prospered in life, I wish each of them so prospered to 
be reminded, and, excepting always those permanently connected with the university 
as instructors and those whose moderate wants press upon their means, I thus in 
advance charge them to imitate my example in rendering aid, through Harvard Col- 
lege, to the cause of arts and letters, of science and learning. 
In his book entitled American Colleges, Dr. Charles F. Thwing, new president of 
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, says: 
The purposes which the fellowship system, as it is now being established in 
American colleges, is intended to serve are the advancement of scholarship and the 
promotion of original thought and investigation. A fellowship in an American col- 
lege is not, as often it is in the English universities, a sinecure. It is not simply the 
reward for success in passing a series of examinations; it is not merely the ladder 
by which the student is to climb to distinction, but it is a privilege by the fit use 
of which he can advance the bigher learning and enlarge the boundaries of human 
knowledge. The fellowship allows the young graduate possessing genius for a cer- 
tain line of investigation but not possessing the pecuniary means for his support to 
pursue studies the result of which shall honor not only him but also scholarship. 16
-P-A-G-E-357
  PECUNIARY AID FOR STUDENTS. _ 1575 
  permits the penniless student interested in philosophy to pursue his philosophy and 
the student of science to continue his chemical or zoological investigations. Without 
its aid the one would be obliged, for example, to devote his powers to professional 
studies for the ministry, and the other to medicine, professions for which each feels 
heis by nature unfit. The fellowship system, therefore, in American colleges is the 
most direct aid to the higher scholarship and to culture. 
In the foundation and administration of fellowships in our colleges, however, the 
strict observance of certain rules is necessary to the attainment of their highest 
usefulness. It is the failure to observe the first two of the three following sugges- 
tions that has brought the English fellowship system into considerable disrepute 
among certain classes of English society. 
(1) The fellowship should not be bestowed merely as a reward for high scholar- 
ship, but principally as the means for prosecuting original research in a compara- 
tively new department of study. 
(2) It should seldom be held for more than three, or at most, for more than four 
years. The progress which the fellow makes in this length of time enables him, 
with but little outlay of time or strength, to give instruction sufficient to provide for 
his pecuniary needs. The fellowship in such a case should at once be reassigned. 
(3) If the fellow resides in Germany, as he usually will, he should be made a sort 
of corresponding member of his college faculty. The information which he could 
transmit regarding the educational movements occurring in the German gymnasia 
and universities would prove of much service to American colleges and American 
scholarship. 
Speaking of the fellowships in English universities, Dr. Thwing says: 
The conditions under which the fellow enjoys his annuity are usually very few 
and liberal. He is at liberty to pursue almost any line of intellectual labor. In 
many cases his position is a mere sinecure, and involves no actual work. In other 
cases it is, and in all cases may be, most effectually used for the advancement of the 
higher learning. 
In some of the English universities certain fellowships are reserved for specified: pro- 
fessors and some of the college offices are held by fellows. After holding such offices 
for a certain length of time the fellows are entitled to retain their fellowship during 
life: In the majority of other cases the tenure of a fellowship in the English univer- 
sities is now limited to seven years. Comparatively few of the fellowships in the 
English universities are provided by specific gifts or bequests. As a rule, a certain 
proportion of the income of a college is set aside, by statute, for a specified num- 
ber of fellowships which are known as foundation fellowships. 
While fellowships are, as a rule, for the use of graduate students, scholarships 
are for the use of both graduate and undergraduate students. Scholarships do 
not generally have as great a pecuniary value as fellowships, and are much more 
frequently bestowed after competitive examinations. The catalogues of universities 
and colleges, not only of this country but also of foreign countries, show that the 
requirement most frequently exacted of candidates for aid is that they be indigent 
or that without the aid granted by a scholarship they would be unable to pursue 
their studies. In many institutions in the United States, especially such as are 
under the control of religious denominations, another favored class is found in 
students preparing for the ministry or for missionary work, and in children of 
clergymen. To such students cither free tuition or a liberal discount on the regular 
rates of tuition is granted. 
The first scholarship in an American college was founded in Harvard College by 
Lady Ann Mowlson, of London, in 1643 by a gift of £100, the income of which was 
to be paid to some poor scholar until he shall attain the degree of master of arts. 
This gift was at first held by the colony of the Massachusetts Bay, and in 1713 was— 
paid over to the college with accrued interest from 1685, by the provincial treasurer. 
In the early part of the last century this fund was probably mixed with other col- 
lege funds and formed part of the stock account. In 1893 the scholarship was rees- 
tablished with a principal of $5,000 taken from the stock account.! 
An attempt has been made to collect information concerning the value, tenure, 
and conditions for obtaining scholarships and fellowships in the several institutions

of the United States, England, France, and Germany. No attention has been paid 
during this research to prizes which are granted for excellence in certain studies and 
which do not require the student to continue his studies. Neither has account been 
taken of the aid given by loan funds, which aid must be returned, frequently with 
interest at a low rate, by the student. The aid given to students is as follows: 
1. UNITED STATES.! 
UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, 
  Howard College, East Lake, Ala.—The sons of ministers engaged in the active work 
of the ministry pay one-half the tuition fee. Students who comply with the regula-

district in the State. Candidates must be needy of aid. The scholarships entitle to 
free tuition, and may be renewed from year to year. There is also a scholarship 
entitling to free tuition for one year for a teacher from each county in the State. 
Also a scholarship entitling to one year’s collegiate tuition to the best student in each 
Arkansas school in which the course of study prepares for the freshman class. 
University of California, Berkeley, Cal.—The fellowships are as follows: (1) The 
Le Conte memorial fellowship, income $500 per annum, is awarded annually by a 
board of administration elected by the alumni association. Candidates must be 
raduates of the University of California of not more than three years’ standing. 
the sole test is superior excellence, and the holder must pursue his studies either at 
the university or elsewhere, as the board may determine. (2) The Hearst fellowships 
in astronomy, value not given, are for students who have already made decided prog- 
ress in their work; candidates for higher degrees are preferred; (3) 4 university 
fellowships, each yielding $600 annually—2 in philosophy, 1 in mathematics, and 1 
in mineralogy. The appointees devote their attention to graduate study and assist 
in the work of their department. 
The scholarships are as follows: The Harvard Club scholarship, not less than $200, 
is awarded annually. to some graduate of the University of California to be used in 
graduate study at Harvard University. The Phebe Hearst scholarships for women 
are 8 in number, each yielding $300. The qualifications are noble character and high 
aims, and it is understood that without this assistance a university course would be 
impossible. The Hinckley scholarship of $300 is awarded annually to some young 
man in the university of the State or some other school. 
Tuition in the College of Letters and the colleges of science is free to all students. 
California College, Oakland, Cal.—There are 3 scholarship funds of $5,000 each and

foundation of $12,000, is awarded annually to a graduate of Yale College of not more 
than three years’ standing at the time of his first appointment; the incumbent may 
be reelected annually until he has held the fellowship for three years, and must pur- 
sue ascholastic, professional, or scientific career in which he gives promise of success. 
He may be required to reside in New Haven one year of thirty-six weeks, but with 
this exception he may attend aS foreign university or the American School of Class-

3. FRANCE. 
The particulars concerning bourses (scholarships) in France have been taken from 
the Annuaire de la Jeunesse for 1893, which contains the following: 
  The bourses (scholarships) maintained by the State in the faculties of sciences and 
of letters are of three kinds: Les bourses de licence (scholarships for candidates for 
the degree of licentiate), les bourses d’agrégation (scholarships for candidates for 
the degree of fellow), les bourses d’études (ordinary scholarships). 
The scholarships of these three kinds are bestowed for one year from the ist of 
November; they are payable monthly in advance, and may be prolonged for a second 
year. ‘They can not be held with another remunerative office. 
Scholarships for candidates for the degree of licentiate.—These scholarships had for- 
merly the uniform value of 1,200 frances ($231.60), but at the present time some of 
them are worth 1,500 francs ($289.50). The candidates must be Frenchmen, between 
the ages of 18 and 25, and must have the bachelor’s degree. They must register 
between the 20th of May and the 20th of June with the secretary of the académie in 
which they reside, indicating the faculties to which they wish to be attached. They 
furnish, besides their certificate of birth and their diploma, (1) a statement signed 
by themselves, giving the profession of their father, the residence of their family, 
the institution or institutions where they were educated or to which they had been 
attached as teachers, the place or places where they have lived since leaving the said 
institutions; (2) a certificate from the head or heads of said institutions, containing, 
with a statement as to the character and aptitude of the candidate, a statement indi- 
cating the amount of suecess which he had obtained in the studies of his classes; 
(3) a statement as to his pecuniary condition. 
The examinations are held at the beginning of July, at the seat of each faculty, on 
the same day. The subjects for the written composition are sent by the minister. 
The examinations are as follows: 
1. In the faculty of letters: A French and a Latin composition; thorough explica- 
tions of a Greek author, of a Latin author, and of a French author from the classes 
of rhetoric and philosophy of the lyceés. The candidates for the licentiate of letters 
with mention of philosophy are examined also in philosophy; the candidates for the 
licentiate of letters with mention of history, in history. The candidates for the 
licentiate of letters with mention of living languages, construe a German or English 
author of the class of rhetoric; to this is added an oral German or English exercise. 
 
-P-A-G-E-391
PECUNIARY AID FOR STUDENTS. 1609 
  For the candidates for the licentiate of letters, pure and simple, the Latin explica- 
tion is double and bears upon a prose writer and upon a poet. 
2. In the faculties of sciences: A composition and some questions on the subjects 
of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history, according to the licentiate 
for which the candidate prepares himself. 
The consultative committee of public instruction arranges the list of candidates in 
the order of merit, taking into account the needs of secondary instruction. Neverthe- 
less the holders of licentiate scholarships should not consider themselves as officers 
to whom the State owed a place at the expiration of their scholarships. While they 
furnish serious and numerous recruits to secondary instruction, the administration of 
public instruction does not intend, however, to make a contract of engagement with 
them. 
The scholars who have received one of the prizes of honor at the general examina- 
tion of the lyceés of Paris or of the departments can obtain a licentiate scholarship 
without taking the examinations just spoken of. 
cholar admitted to one of the licentiates of sciences can obtain, without anew 
examination, a scholarship for one of the other two licentiates. This newscholarship 
is for one year and can not be renewed, except on a special report of the dean, of the 
rector, and upon the vote of the consultative committee. 
The number of licentiate scholarships granted to new incumbents in October, 1892, 
was as follows: In mathematics, 17 entire scholarships, 1 three quarters scholarship, 
Lhalf scholarship; in physical sciences, 12 entire scholarships, 2 half scholarships; in 
natural sciences, 4 entire scholarships, 1 half scholarship; in letters, 23 entire scholar- 
ships, 1 three-quarters scholarship, 5 half scholarships; in letters (history), 9 entire 
scholarships, 1 half scholarship; letters (philosophy), 4 entire scholarships; letters 
(German), 6 entire scholarships; letters (English), 3 entire scholarships, 1 half 
scholarship. 
Of the entire scholarships, 32 were for 1,500 francs ($289.50); the others of 1,200 
francs ($231.60). 
The number of licentiate scholarships for one year from November 1, 1893, given to 
young men who had been called under the flag, and who enjoyed their scholarships 
during the year 1893-94, was as follows: In mathematics, 7 entire scholarships, 1 three- 
quarters scholarship; physical sciences, 2entire scholarships; letters, 3 entire scholar- 
ships, 1 three-quarters scholarship; letters (English), 1 half scholarship. Three of 
these scholarships were worth 1,500 francs ($289.50); the others, 1,200 francs ($231.60). 
The scholarships for licentiates of letters with mention of living languages are 
bestowed at first for two years. During the first year the young men who hold them 
reside in foreign countries, either in Germany or in England. They receive, besides 
thescholarship, an allowance for travelingand living expenses. The second year they 
return to France and attend the lectures of a faculty. 
Scholarships for candidates for the degree of fellow.—These are of 1,500 franes ($289.50) 
or of 1,800 frances ($347.40). The candidates must be at least 30 years of age. They 
address their request, between the Ist and 20th of July, to the dean of the faculty 
where they have taken the degree of licentiate. 
They add to this request the certificates of the heads of the institutions where they 
have taught. If they have been licentiate scholars they annex a special report from 
the professors whose courses they have followed. All these documents, accompanied 
by explanatory remarks, by the conclusions arrived at by the dean, and by a report 
showing how the ulty intends to prepare for the degree of fellow, aresent through 
the rector to the minister, who takes the advice of the consultative committee of supe- 
rior instruction. Some of the scholarships for candidates for the degree of fellow can 
be bestowed upon the report of the boards of examination of the various bodies of 
secondary instruction. 
The number of this class of scholarships bestowed in 1892 on new incumbents is 
shown in the following table:

  1610 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  Ordinary scholarships.—These are of the annual yalue of 1,500 francs ($289.50); 
they are intended to encourage free and disinterested research in the faculties of 
sciences and of letters. These scholarships are each year of a variable number, 
according as the needs of secondary instruction make the number of scholarships 
for licentiates and fellows vary. They are bestowed upon nomination by the facul- 
ties and confirmation by the consultative committee of superior instruction. ‘The 
conditions for obtaining them are very broad; strictly, no degree is required; it is 
sufficient to have given proof of aptitude in a certain branch of science. Now- 
adays, since the professors no longer live isolated from the students, they know 
their talents; they designate those who ought to be encouraged. Thusit is expected 
to attach by degrees to the faculties of sciences and of letters a distinct clientage 
of candidates for the degrees, and who are more especially engaged in researches of 
a scientific order. 
A certain number of these scholarships are reserved for students in law, in medi- 
cine, and in pharmacy, to pursue literary and scientific studies 
The candidates must register before August 1 with the secretaries of the academies. 
Annual grants by departments, cities, and associations in Savor of scholars of the fac- 
ulties and schools of superior instruction—These grants are applied to the creation of 
prizes and the support of scholars; they may vary from year to year. The grants 
for scholarships, of which the faculties of Paris are the beneficiaries, and which are 
renewed from year to year, are as follows: Faculty of Protestant theology, 1,600 
francs ($308. 80) from the general synod of the Church of the Augsburg Confession, 
800 franes ($154.40) from the consistory of Nimes, 1,000 francs ($193) from the asso- 
ciation for the encouragement of the studies at the faculty; faculty of law, 6,000 
frances ($1,158) from the city of Paris; faculty of medicine, 6,000 francs (1,158) from 
the city of Paris; higher school of pharn , 8,000 franes ($579) from the city of 
Paris. These grants “from the city of Paris are distributed in scholarships of 1,200 
franes ($231. 60) and in half scholarships of 600 franes ($115.80). 
The city of Bordeaux awards scholarships (number not given) at the faculties of 
sciences and of letters. 
The cities of Lille, Amiens, Abbeville, and the department of Ardennes support or 
haye supported some young men pursuing their studies at the faculties of sciences 
and of letters at Lille. 
Besides these scholarships supported by the State, cities, and associations, there 
are cight scholarships of the valne of 1, 600 franes ($193) each at the faculties of 
Paris, “founded by gifts from individuals. 
      
         
     
  4, GERMANY. 
In the German universities there is no system of fellowships and scholarships. 
Students are aided by having their tuition fees postponed or remitted, and by free 
dinners and cash benefices. The following account of the aid given to students in 
German universities is taken from an article on German universities, printed in the 
Annual Report for 1891-92: 
Since time out of date pecuniary aid has been offered to students in order to facil- 
itate their attendance in the university; this has been done in three ways: First, 
by postponing the payment of lecture fees; second, by granting free dinners; and 
third, by benefices in cash. It is to be regretted that complete statements concern- 
ing these benefices are not available; it is only in recent years that the Prussian 
university statistics offer any information under this heading. 
How the lecture fees are to be paid, as well as their amounts, for what period the 
paying of the fees may be postponed, aro questions settled by the professors them- 
selves. In Prussian universities indigent students are relieved temporarily from the 
payment of theso fees, if they petition for postponement and furnish the questor 
with documentary cvidenco of poverty, signed by home authorities, Usually the 
payment is postponed for six years, after which the questor attempts to collect the 
fees, unless the debtor has no fixed employment or regular source of income. Fre- 
quently the final settlement is set aside if the debtor’s financial condition remains 
unsatisfactory. In late years the petitions for postponement of payment of fees have 
considerably decreased in numbers; they are found almost exclusively in the theo- 
logic and philosophic faculties. The postponement of payment is not granted with 
the same liberality in all the universities. Tho principle has been adopted lately 
of not postponing the payment of any fees during the first semester; 1m other univer- 
sities the postponement holds good only for the time of study in that particular 
institution. Where postponement is customary release from payment is excluded, 
while in some universities 2 commission examines each case and releases the student 
from payment; but in such institutions postponement is not customary.     
     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-393
  
       PECUNIARY AID FOR STUDENTS. 1611 
  During the year 1887-88 the payment of fees was postponed in 3,010 cases, or 22 per 
cent of all students; 2,891 of these students were native Prussians, 94 had come 
from other parts of Germany, 25 were foreigners. During that year 25.63 per cent of 
the Prussian students enjoyed this kind of beneficence (in 8 semesters an average 
of 26.1 per cent). The proportions varied in different universities; while in Berlin, 
Bonn, Halle, Kiel, and Kénigsberg the percentage was 20.4 and 20.9 per cent, it was 
only 7.6 per centin Marburg, 9.34 per cent in Géttingen, 10 per cent in Braunsberg, 
17.6 per cent in Miinster, but 54.5 per cent in Greifswald. Some of those who 
enjoyed these benefices were sons of professors, who according to the charter of the 
institution are exempt from lecture fees, but their number is very small. There are 
also cases of professors who do not charge for private instruction to foreigners, but 
such cases do not come under observation. Some students pay part of their fees 
and postpone the payment of the other. 
All in all, it may be said that fully one-fourth of all the students are in needy 
circumstances, and furnish proof of this fact, whereupon the benefice mentioned is _ 
accorded them. This percentage is considerably increased if we add those who 
receive benefices in cash in addition to the postponement of lecture fees or depend 
upon aid in cash only. In Prussia 2,430, or 17.9 per cent, of all the students receive 
cash benefices; 76 of these were foreigners, 236 were Germans, but not native Prus- 
sians. - Free dinners were given to 1,052 persons, 7.7 per cent of the students. But 
since these dinners were frequently given to the same persons, it will not do to add 
the total numbers of the three classes in order to arrive at the number of those 
who enjoy benefices. If each one is counted but once, we get a total of 4,510, or 
more than one-third of all the students. Among these were 88 foreigners, 414 Prus- 
sians, and 308 other Germans. The Prussians represent a percentage of 36.48 per 
cent of the students; 18.74 per cent received benetices in cash and 8.77 per cent free 
dinners. There can be no doubt that the number of bencticiaries is actually greater 
than stated in the foregoing, because many are not counted who receive aid from 
private sources in their native towns. ‘This phase of the question is of greater 
importance in regard to the amount of benefices than in regard to the number of 
beneficiaries. 
Altogether 2,868 German students received cash aid and free dinners amounting 
to a value of 441,619 marks ($105,989), which is equal to 154 marks ($37) per semester. 
Since the number of benefices given was 3,346, it is plain that a number of students 
received several kinds of benefices. However, this statement falls much behind the 
actual truth; the causes of this are found in the foregoing. Seventy per cent of 
3,346 cases of aid consisted of cash gifts and 30 per cent free dinners. The 70 per 
cent in number had a value of 87 per cent. 
A word concerning the sources of these benefices may be welcome. We state that 
1,341=40 per cent, - valued at 124,745 marks ($32,339) = 30.5 per cent, were derived 
from fands of the universities; 1, 470— 42 9 per cent, valued at 212,708 marks ($51,050) 
= 48 per cent, were derived ‘from funds appropriated by municipal governments, 
corporations, éte., and 585—=17.1 per cent, valued at 94,166 marks ($22,600) = 21.5 per 
cent, were derived from family endowments. Concerning the last-mentioned item 
we may say that, owing to want of information, it may ke very much too small. 
The Prussian minister of education paid in 1891-92 the sum of 68,766 marks ($16,704) 
to needy students, and besides that had at his disposal a fund of 100,000 marks 
($24,000) for such students of German parentage who consented to accept govern- 
ment positions in the Polish provinces. The foregoing numbers are distributed 
among the faculties as follows: 
Benefices in cash and free dinners were given in 1887-88 per semester to students 
of the—

      From the foregoing table we sec that the students of theology are the most numer- 
ous of those receiving aid, partly because they are mostly in needy circumstances ;

partly, also, because for such students the largest benefit funds are in existence. 
The percentage of the philosophic faculty, which used to be much larger, has 
decreased in late years in consequence of the addition of students who did not for- 
merly have the right of citizenship in the university, such as agriculturists, phar- 
macists, etc., and for whom very few endowments for scholarships and benefices 
exist, 
The amounts paid to individuals are generally very small. Almost one-half the 
number of cash benefices amounted to 100 marks ($24) or less per semester. Only 30 
amounted to 500 to 800 marks ($120 to $192). Only 9 amounted to 800 marks and 
more. 
The statistics of public instruction in the Kingdom of Bavaria, embracing the 
years 1869-1892, contain the statement that of every 100 students, 20 were completely 
exempt from the payment of lecture fees; 25 partially so; together, 45 per cent. Of 
the students of theology, 59 per cent belong to that class; of the law students, 40 per 
cent; of the medical students, 39 per cent; of the students of philosophy, 50 percent. 
Fifteen per cent of the students (330) received aid in cash (54,298 marks, or $13,132) = 
164.5 marks ($39.38) per capita.

  CHAPTER VI. 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION. 
At the close of the year 1892-93 detailed statistical reports concerning university 
extension courses of lectures were received from 26 institutions. These institutions 
reported that they had delivered during the year 418 courses, or a total of 3,022 lec- 
tures, with an aggregate average attendance of 56,601. The average attendance at 
35 courses of lectures was not reported by the institutions concerned. Ten of the 
courses of lectures were delivered in California, 3 in Colorado, 3 in Connecticut, 2 in 
Delaware, 119 in Illinois, 15 in Indiana, 3 in Kansas, 3 in Kentucky, 6 in Louisiana, 
8 in Maine, 1 in Maryland, 4 in Massachusetts, 6 in Michigan, 6 in Missouri, 21 in 
New Jersey, 34 in New York, 15 in Ohio, 1 in Oregon, 115 in Pennsylvania, 1 in Vir- 
ginia, 2in West Virginia, and 2in Wyoming. The location of 38 of the centers was 
not reported. 
Two of the courses were on philosophy, 3 on mathematics, 1 on university exten- 
sion, 6 on education or pedagogy, 23 on art, 48 on political or social science, 50 on 
natural or physical science, 119 on history, 128 on literature, and the subjects of 38 
courses were not reported.

In addition to the courses reported by the above-mentioned institutions, the 
University of California gave 2 courses of lectures on English, 1 on mathematics, 1 
on pedagogy, and 2 on scientific subjects; Napa College, Napa, Cal., gave 1 course 
of 6 lectures on psychology; Cornell College, Mount Vernon, Iowa, gave 1 course on 
history; the University of Minnesota gave 3 courses on history and 1 on English 
literature;, Missouri Valley College, Marshall, Mo., gave 1 course of 24 lectures on

The number of institutions maintaining summer schools is rapidly increasing. 
This form of instruction may be considered as another phase of university exten- 
sion; for, by such means, university instruction and the extensive libraries, labora- 
tories, and museums are rendered available, during the summer months, to teachers 
and other persons who are not able to attend the regular sessions of universities

  CHAPTER VII. 
MEDICAL EDUCATION) 
RAISING THE STANDARD. 
Medical education in this country is now making one of the longest strides for- 
ward that has occurred in its history. This step is the lengthening of the course to 
three and four years of eight or nine months, instead of the old course of two years 
of four or five months. We say this step isnow being taken, for while many schools 
have already lengthened their courses duriug the last eight years, there are others 
which have arranged to do so soon, and still others which are certain to follow along 
afterwards.? So the work of higher medical education is still in a progressive state, 
in that many medical schools have not as yet entered upon their full course of 
instruction, but it is probable that nearly all of the colleges will have completed 
this extension during the next four or five years. When they have done so, and one 
can take a retrospective glance and see that every medical school has added one or 
two years to its course, and has lengthened the annual session to eight or nine 
months, the question will naturally arise, What was the moving cause of this exten- 
sion? Why was it that the medical colleges, which for decades had been contented 
with a course of two years of four or five months each, began to adopt courses of 
three or four years of eight or nine months each? 
In fact, this question has already been answered by several writers, but the 
explanations must have come from different standpoints, as they arrive at different 
conclusions. It is said by some that the Illinois State board of health, of which Dr, 
John H. Rauch was secretary, was the prime cause, when it announced that no 
school having a course of less than three years would be considered in good standing 
and that its graduates could not practice in Tilinois without first undergoing an 
examination, Others say that the medical practice acts adopted in several States dur- 
ing the last five or six years began the work; others attribute it to the resolutions of 
the American Medical College Association in favor of higher education; others claim 
that “it was inaugurated by the American Institute of Homeopathy in 1888, when 
it was ordered that ‘After the coilege sessions of 1890-91 each and all of the homeo- 
pathic schools of America will require of their candidates for graduation at least 
three years of medical study, including three full courses of didactic and clinical 
instruction of at least six months each.’” 
It is probable that many of the leading medical institutions had for some time 
been in favor of extending the course, but were deterred from fear that their students 
would leave for competing colleges where less time was required. But when some 
        
  1By A. Erskine Miller. 
2The Association of American Medical Colleges, at its meeting in San Francisco, June 7, 1804, 
“Resolved, That students graduating in 1899 or subsequent classes be required to pursue the study of 
medicine four years and to have attended four annual courses of lectures of not less than six months’ 
duration each.” 
ED 93——102-

of the institutions which constituted departments in heavily endowed universities 
became less dependent upon tuition fees, they were able to adopt longer courses 
without considering its effect upon attendance. Besides, about this time the num- 
ber of medical students was becoming unusually large, so that some schools did not 
really desire an attendance larger than they could well accommodate. By adopting 
a longer course they would still have as many students as desired, and they would 
send out graduates better prepared to gain credit for themselves and for the 
institution. ‘ 
Many of the State boards of health now announce that they will not recognize 
any institution unless it exacts a full threo years’ course of study and complies with 
all other standard requirements of cducation.! One of the results likely to follow from 
this elevation of the course is that there will be fewer new colleges coming into exist- 
ence, for unless an institution has a good standing with the State boards of health 
or examining bedies, it can not reasonably expect to meet with much success. But 
as the present number of medical colleges will be ample for many years to come, no 
complaint will be made because others can not come into existence. In fact, medical 
education would be advanced if some institutions already existing were consolidated 
with others in the same locality. 2 
“The chief difficulty in making a high standard universal lies in the number of 
the medical colleges. It is, indeed, a sorry admission that the medical schools in this 
country are the greatest enemy to medical progress, not in themselves but in their 
number. * * * The remedy lies in their amalgamation. Let the absurdity cease 
of small towns haying three, four, or six of these struggling institutions, no one of 
which can have a vigorous life. 
“There is now all over the country a growing disposition for the universities to 
tako charge of medical teaching and to develop their medical departments with all 
the zeal they give to the others, We see it in Michigan; we seo it in California and 
Colorado; we see it in Louisiana and Texas as strikingly as in our Eastern States. 
There is nothing but good in this. . The power, the means, the spirit of the univer- 
sity go out to its branch; the university in turn gains by the reputation of its 
medical faculty, and by the recognition that medicine is an essential part of the new 
learning which leads on to the highest attainable civilization.” ? 
EFFECT ON ATTENDANCE OF LENGTHENING THE COURSE. 
  The question may be asked, How has the attendance of students been affected by 
the requirement of another year of study? Adding one year to the course means 
not only increasing the amount of time required, but also an increase in the finan- 
cial outlay. It would therefore naturally be expected that many young men would 
be led to seek other lines of employment. In order to determine this question some- 
what dofinitely the statistics for the last five years have been collected of medical, 
dental, pharmaceutical, and law students, as all of these haye had lengthened courses. 
Instead of any decrease, however, we find the number of students to have grown 
steadily larger. In 1888-89 the number of medical students was 15,029; since that 
time the number has goue steadily forward to 19,752 in 1892-93. As yet even the 
number of graduates has suffered no special loss, except in the dental schools, where 
the number of graduates in 1891-92 was 1,282 and fell to 507 in 1892-93, when the 
graduating class first encountered the three-year regulation. 
Athough the actual number of students in attendance during the last five years 
has regularly increased, it is still very probable that many have been kept out by 
  
ISince the above was written the regulations have been made still moro stringent. In Oregon, 
Montana, and Minnesota after 1898 an attendance upon four courses of lectures will be required. 
“The Regents of the State University [of New York] have voted to confer the university degree 
M.D. only after one year’s postgraduate study subsequent to receiving tho degree of bachelor or 
doctor of medicine from some registered medical school, and only on candidates who have spent not 
less than four years total study in accredited medical schools.”—N. Y. Med. Record, July 20, 1895.

LEGAL CONTROL OF THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. 
  Unless it be the American Medical College Association, probably nothing has 
contributed so much to the advancement of medical education in the United States 
as the establishment of State licensing boards, frequently called boards of health 
on account of a union of their functions. Here we see how far-reaching and 
important a little clausc sometimes becomes, in a law which directs the licensing 
boards to register all graduates ‘of colleges in good standing.” Probably no one of 
the legislators who first voted for the bill containing these words, now found in the 
law of several States, had any idea of what a powerful leverage they would 
become in the hands of State licensing boards for stimulating medical colleges to 
lengthen their course of study and raise the requirements for entrance and gradua- 
tion. But when the Illinois State buard announced that no medical school would 
be regarded in good standing which did not require three courses of lectures, the 
institutions immediately began to fall into line in lengthening their courses, for in 
truth many schools had favored such an extension before, but were deterred from 
taking the step because their competitors did not adopt it.. Now, however, they 
recognized the fact that all schools would soon be compelled to advance their stand- 
ards. This valuable work of State licensing boards was soon recognized in other 
States, and now we find such boards in thirty-five States and Territories, all of them 
contributing to a large extent in placing medical education upon a plane where it 
will reflect honor upon its followers. 
It was not many years ago when, in almost any State in the Union, anyone could 
hang out his sign as a medical practitioner and charge as high fees as the best quali- 
fied physician in the town. Why, then, should one spend several years in preparing 
for his work and deplete his purse with the hope of being able to refill it again? It 
might be said that the meritorious physician would be able eventually to show 
beyond doubt his qualifications, while the half-educated doctor would be unable to 
hide his mistakes. That is true to some extent, but the latter generally is able to
-P-A-G-E-402
1620 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  recognize this fact himself, and when the truth begins to reveal itself to the people, 
he quietly moves off, possibly to another section of the same city, and begins to plod 
his old course in a country new. The meritorious doctor then sees that what he 
expected has taken place, but as a vacancy has occurred, another one soon moves in 
who has possibly bought out the good will of the departing brother, and then per- 
haps begins again the identical course of events. Besides, medical- knowledge and 
skill do not alone determine a physician’s success; there are other things that help 
to decide it. An air of self confidence, a good personal appearance, a cheerful and 
sociable disposition, and a happy faculty for making acquaintances go far toward 
securing a reputation as an able physician, and if united with a good degree of 
dependence on vis medicatrix nature he may enjoy many happy days of visiting 
patients, drawing a veil over ill-timed prescriptions, collecting good fees, and 
receiving high encomiums from warm-hearted friends. 
It may be said that the well qualified physician should also endeavor to possess 
these external requisites, that they are really as essential in restoring health to the 
invalid as a well selected prescription; but that is no reason why they should con- 
‘stitute the stock in trade; no reason why the confiding patient should be left to 
chance or to nature when by the administration of the proper medicine, convales- 
cence would at once begin. But, above all, that is no reason why, so far as can be 
avoided and when perhaps a life is in danger, dependence should be had upon some 
one supposed to possess both knowledge and skill, when in fact he has neither. 
This only illustrates the ease with which deception can be practiced in the healing 
art, and why the governments of Europe and so many States of this country have 
adopted regulations to secure at least presumptive evidence that medical practition- 
ers are qualified for their responsible duties. The people have not sufficient time, 
as individuals, to examine into the qualifications of physicians, to say nothing of 
the opportunities and knowledge necessary to properly determine such a question. 
Frequently it is not until some member of the family has been suddenly taken sick 
that the question arises what physician shall be called, and the query is quite often 
determined by hurrying to the first drug store and inquiring of the clerk for the 
nearest physician. 
There are eighteen States in which the diploma of no medical college confers the 
right to practice, but all candidates for this privilege must undergo an examination. 
These States are Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, 
South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington. In seventeen 
other States the diploma confers this right only when the board of health or other 
determining body shall have declared the college to be ‘‘in good standing,” and 
this has been interpreted to mean that they are satisfied with the entrance require- 
ments, the length of the term, the number of courses required before graduation, the 
character of the instruction given, and all other items which aid in fully qualifying 
the graduate to practice. In some instances State boards have announced in 
advance that they would recognize no college which did not require so many courses 
of lectures, or which did not have an annual session of so many months. Medical 
institutions would then see that they must comply with these requirements or else 
their graduates from such States would be on unequal footing with those from other 
schools, and consequently the number of their students would be diminished. In 
self-defense, therefore, they must comply with all reasonable stipulations. 
“A conspicuous effect of these laws has been seen in the improvement of the 
standard of medical education. To them, more than to any one cause, is due the 
difference which exists between the condition now and in 1870. In Alabama, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Ilinois, Nebraska, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington, 
at least three full courses of five to six months each, no two in the same year, are 
demanded. The State of Oregon, after 1898, will require four courses of six months 
each from physicians who wish to practice in that State. There is not only a pro- 
longation of the period of study as the effect of these laws, but there is also an   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-403
MEDICAL EDUCATION, 1621 
  increased demand for a preliminary education, the establishment of new professor- 
ships, and more exacting examinations for the degree. Of all agents distinctly 
bringing about this change, the Illinois State board of health, and especially its 
secretary, the late Dr. John H. Rauch, deserve the highest consideration.” ! 
In twelve States and Territories it is required only that the candidates for licen- 
sure shall present a diploma from some medical school; no question being asked as 
to the character of the instruction given in the school. This opens a wide door 
to dishonest evasions of the law, and the traffic in fraudulent diplomas flourishes 
in consequence. The registrar of medical practitioners frequently has practically 
no information as to the medical schools of the country, and makes no pretense 
to examination of the diplomas. But another serious defect in many States is that 
little or no effort is made to see that unregistered physicians do not practice. The 
law is left to enforce itself. 
An act to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery was lately passed by the 
legislature of Maine, but its requirements have not yet been ascertained. This 
leaves New Hampshire as the only State in the Union with no medical-practice law, 
which it will soon have to enact in self-defense. 
In New York the law has probably gone further than in any other State to prevent 
the licensing of persons not qualified. It is intended, in the first place, to prevent 
anyone from entering upon the study of medicine who has not the proper preliminary 
education, and in the second place it prevents anyone from beginning practice with- 
out undergoing an examination elsewhere than at the college he attended. Every 
medical student is required by the law of 1889, as amended in 1890, to file with the 
regents of the University of the State of New York a certificate ‘showing either 
that he possesses the degree of bachelor or master of arts, of bachelor or master of 
science, or of bachelor or doctor of philosophy, received by him from a college or 
university duly authorized to confer the same, or that during or prior to the first 
year of his medical study within this State he passed an examination conducted 
under the authority of the regents of the University of the State of New York or by 
the faculty of a medical school or college entitled to confer the degree of doctor of 
medicine, in accordance with the standard and rules of the said regents in arithmetic, 
grammar, geography, orthography, American history, English composition, and the 
elements of natural philosophy, or in their substantial equivalents approved by the 
said regents, or that he possessed qualifications which the regents considered and 
accepted as fully equivalent to the above-named qualifications.” 
After he has received his degree, and before he can begin practice, the medical 
student in New York is required to pass an examination before the State board of 
examiners, regular, homeopathic, or eclectic. (Law of May, 1893.) 
In several other States the laws on this subject are of very recent date, showing 
that the trend of legislation is strongly toward safeguards against incompetent 
practitioners. In Pennsylvania an act was passed May 18, 1893, to take effect March 
1, 1894, requiring an examination before a State board of examiners. In Connecticut 
the law regulating the practice of medicine only went into effect October 1, 1893, 
and in Nebraska it was enacted in July, 1891. In South Carolina the law requiring 
an examination was repealed December 24, 1890, but was reenacted in December, 1893, 
The laws of Georgia, Rhode Island, and Maine are of still more recent enactment. 
The medical-practice law of Georgia takes effect January 1, 1895. It provides for 
three distinct boards of examiners of five members each, regular, homeopathic, 
eclectic. All applicants for license must undergo an examination before one of the 
boards, but no one can be examined except graduates of incorporated medical 
colleges requiring not less than three full courses of six months each.

FRAUDULENT MEDICAL SCHOOLS. 
In the report on education for 1894 of the Illinois State board of health, notice is 
given of forty-six medical schools which have fraudulently carried on the business of 
diploma selling, six of which were chartered within the last five years. Before the 
States had any laws restricting the practice of medicine, fraudulent schools could 
not reap a harvest from selling bogus diplomas, because no diploma was needed; any- 
one could claim to be a doctor. But when the States began to enact laws forbid- 
ding anyone to practice medicine who was not a graduate of a ‘legally chartered 
medical school,” a diploma became a valuable article, because it answered the pur- 
pose of securing alicense. It even did more than this; inasmuch as the law required 
a diploma as evidence of special skill and training before one could practice, there- 
fore when one possessed the diploma it was to be inferred that he also had the 
required skill and training. Hence a diploma not only gave one the right to prac- 
tice, but also furnished presumptive evidence of his qualifications. A demand for 
 
-P-A-G-E-405
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 1623 
  diplomas therefore immediately arose, and the supply was soon fully equal to the 
demand. Had it not been for the energetic efforts of the Illinois State board of 
health, to whom great credit should be given for exposing at least ten of these bogus 
colleges, there would no doubt have been many others in existence. But notwith- 
standing the efforts to weed out all diplomas of fraudulent schools they still find a 
ready market, for although it has been repeatedly shown how easily a diploma can 
be obtained from a ‘legally chartered school,” yet the legislatures are slow to act, 
and it does not fall within the province of any particular one to have the law 
changed, and the medical profession especially can not well make the effort lest a 
charge of selfishness be brought against them. Even when the venders of bogus 
diplomas are brought into the courts and fined they only engage in the business 
more assiduously than ever in order to recover the amounts they have lost. ‘‘Carey 
has been twice arrested, convicted, and fined for practicing medicine illegally, never- 
theless his diplomas are recognized in Washington, Idaho, and elsewhere as those of 
a legally chartered institution, and persons are practicing thereon.”! A hardware 
dealer in Buffalo, who had never spent an hour in the study of medicine, received 
by express his medical diploma, dated May 27, 1889, paying for it $60 on delivery. 
These bogus diplomas are found in all the States allowing practice on a diploma from 
a legally chartered medical school, and they are not even confined to this country, 
but find their way across the Atlantic. Complaint has more than once been made 
to the National Government by the European authorities of persons seeking prac- 
tice on the strength of fraudulent American diplomas. It is probable that since the 
medical colleges aro all lengthening their courses and adopting other restrictive 
measures, there will be a greater demand than ever for diplomas from “legally char- 
tered medical schools.” 
SPRING COURSES OF LECTURES. 
A few years ago the catalogues of nearly all medical schools spoke particularly of 
spring courses of lectures, and of the advantages students might derive from them. 
Now there is very little said on the subject. At that time the length of the 
annual session was only four or five months, and it was a common occurrence even 
then for first-year students to leave a month or two before the close of the session. 
Many institutions recognized the importance of longer sessions, and endeavored to 
remedy the matter by having a complementary session in the spring or fall, but not- 
withstanding the efforts made to get students to attend them, the number was 
always insignificant. A more effective method has therefore been instituted. 
Quite a number of institutions have lengthened the regular annual course to six or 
seven months, and some to eight or nine months, and the students not in the gradu- 
ating class are required to remain till the close of the session before they can receive 
the certificate of a year’s attendance. Consequently these colleges no longer have 
any complementary course, although the students have the privilege of remaining 
during the summer and attending the clinics if they so desire, but this is scarcely 
advisable after a long medical session. In answer to the question asking the num- 
ber of weeks in the spring course, fifty-five medical schools state that they have no 
spring course, while only twenty-two answer affirmatively; the remaining schools 
do not answer at all, but very probably have no spring course. 
    STUDY UNDER A PRECEPTOR. 
A few years ago, when nearly all medical colleges had a course of only two years 
of four or five months, it was generally stated in the catalogues that the student 
would be required to spend one year under a preceptor before he could matriculate; 
and this would have been of much value to him if it was spent under proper direc- 
tion and attention; but unfortunately those physicians who were most competent to 
1 Rep. Ill. Board of Health, p. 140.  
-P-A-G-E-406
1624 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
direct his work were generally so engrossed with other duties that they had little 
time to devote to the medical student. The latter soon recognized the fact that his 
time was not being well spent, and that he must look after his own interests; con- 
sequently he usually spent only a few months, or perhaps weeks, in the study of 
anatomy, aided only by a few bones which had been hidden away in his preceptor’s 
office. He then went to some medical college where he felt confident he could com- 
plete the course in a brief period, registered his name, age, and residence, and the 
name of his preceptor, paid his matriculation fee, and began to attend the same lec- 
tures as those who were soon to complete the course, He soon recognized, however, 
that he labored under difficulties, for he was nonplussed at the terms spondylolis- 
thesis, symphyseotomy, colporraphy, odphorectomy, sponge tents, etc., but when he 
spoke of it to his fellow-students they allayed all fears by telling him he would hear 
exactly the same thing the next year and would then understand it. 
Now that the medical schools have adopted graded courses of three and four years, 
and the student is Jed along in his work in an orderly and systematic manner, he is 
no longer required to spend any time under a preceptor, for it is well known that 
his time could be far better employed at the institution; in fact, the time in a pre- 
ceptor’s office is wasted. ‘According to Dr. N, 8. Davis it (reading medicine in a 
doctor’s office) consisted in 1877 in little more than the registry of the student’s 
name in the doctor’s office, permission to read the books of his library, or not, as he 
chose, and the giving of a certificate of time of study for the student to take to the 
medical college when he expected to graduate.” 
CLINICAL INSTRUCTION. 
  Although the State governments and municipalities render very little assistance 
directly to medical education, yet indirectly very much is done by city govern- 
ments and charitable citizens, an aid the lack of which would be serious indeed, 
but one which is not yet fully utilized. How difficult would be medical instruction 
without hospitals to furnish illustrations of the various diseases; and especially 
difficult would it be to give instruction in surgery. It would be the written descrip- 
tion of a steamboat to a boy, instead of placing him on the wharf where he might 
see it with his eyes instead of having to build it up with his brain. The cata- 
~ logues of medical institutions almost without exception call particular attention 
to the hospital advantages which they possess, indicating how important it is 
that the student enjoy full clinical opportunities. These hospitals have some- 
times been established by the munificence of wealthy individuals, frequently as 
memorials of relatives or friends. Municipalities often establish them, and when 
their great usefulness is made apparent to the public, friends spring up to make 
known their claims, and they meet with the success so evidently merited. Every large 
city now has one or more of these institutions ready to receive and carefully attend 
the indigent sick and those suffering from accidental injuries. The advantages of 
treatment in alarge hospital possessing all necessary appliances and accommodations 
arranged for constant use, and in furnishing well-trained nurses, are so great that 
many persons of ample means prefer to be treated there rather than at home. But 
to the poor, who can barely provide common food and shelter when in health, and 
whose domestic environment is frequently such as to induce disease instead of ward- 
ing it off, the hospital comes as a great blessing, furnishing proper diet, the advice 
of skillful and experienced physicians, and attendance of trained nurses; and the 
only compensation asked of them is that young men and women whose work in life 
will be to ameliorate suffering and cure disease shall be permitted to observe the 
symptoms characteristic of different diseases, so that they may afterwards be able 
to recognize them at a glance and institute proper treatment at the outset of disease. 
No medica] student can properly enter upon the practice of his profession until he 
has had this clinical teaching, for it is a knowledge which can not be obtained from. 
books and lectures. All medical colleges make special efforts to provide for their 
students full instruction of this kind.
-P-A-G-E-407
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 1625 
But since the courses in medical colleges have been raised to three and four years 
and the sessions lengthened to eight and nine months the schools need other assist- 
ance than that derived from clinical instruction in the hospitals; for, notwith- 
standing the great value of this instruction, it is not a source of revenue at all. 
The schools should not be left to depend upon tuition fees for support. This fact is 
becoming known to men of wealth, and some institutions are recetving substantial 
assistance from them. 
Mr. William Deering, a wealthy Chicago manufacturer, has given $50,000 to the 
trustees of the Northwestern University, to endow a chair in honor of Dr. N. S. 
Davis, in the medical department of the university—the old Chicago Medical Col- 
lege, of which Dr. Davis was the founder. 
The Harvard medical school received a bequest in 1894 valued at $50,000, under the 
will of the late Rev. W. C. Moseley, of Newburyport. : 
The New York Homeopathic Medical College received from the estate of Mr. 
William Ogden $50,000. 
The medical department of the University of Pennsylvania received $50,000 from 
Dr. William Pepper when resigning his position as provost of the university. 
STUDENTS HAVING DEGREES. 
  It would be of interest to know how the percentage of medical students having 
degrees in arts or science at the present time compares with the number of such 
students some years ago, especially since we find the secondary schools constantly 
increasing the amount of work required of their students and consequently raising 
the age at which it can be completed; while, on the other hand, the medical schools 
are all adopting courses of three or four years and at the same time becoming much 
more rigid in the requirements for matriculation. To determine with any accuracy 
the number of medical students having degrees in arts or sciences is a difficult mat- 
ter, for only a few medical schools keep an accurate record of this item. Harvard 
Medical College is one of the few institutions which keep this record. In it the 
decrease in the number of graduate students since 1884 has been remarkable. The 
figures are as follows:   
e Per cent of Per cent of 
Year. aduates. | graduates. 
    Here we find that since the year 1884, with one exception, there has been a uni- 
form decrease. The per cent of students holding degrees in Harvard medical school 
would no doubt compare quite favorably with the number in any other school, and 
since it is about to add a fourth year to its course the proportion of graduate 
students will probably be diminished still further. = 
Medical graduates would doubtless be well qualified for their work if they first 
completed the entire secondary school course, which President Eliot places at about 
the eighteenth or nineteenth year; then a college course at 23 and the medical at 26 
years of age, or at 27 in those schools which require four years; and allowing them 
only three years for hospital experience and in which to get located and a practice 
started, such students might be expected to become self-supporting at 30 years of 
age. No allowance is made here for the loss of a year or two by failure to reach the 
required standard at any time, or on account of sickness, or other reason, but it is a 
steady, nonintermittent course, and one which needs to be sustained by a well-filled 
purse. At a recent congress of American physicians and surgeons a member claimed 
that the medical student should have the A, B. degree, requiring four years; then he
-P-A-G-E-408
1626 , EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  should spend four years in a medical school, one year in a hospital, and one year in 
a medical school in Europe—making ten years inall. Dr. P. 8. Connor, of Cincinnati, 
argued that it would be unjust to insist upon all students that they should first be 
in possession of the A. B. degree, and then possibly have to practice at some country 
crossroads where the people around were unable to speak a single sentence correctly. 
However, to prescribe a course of training is one thing; to have it followed is 
another. To make it a requirement of all medical students that they should take 
the course mentioned above, requiring ten years for completion and only to be 
finished after 30 years of age, would be to demand what is impracticable. Not only 
would many students be prevented from taking such a course from financial reasons, 
and others claim that their prospective income in rural districts would not justify 
it, but there are also some educators who hold that there should be 2 better adjust- 
ment of the collegiate and professional courses—that the collegiate student should 
have better opportunities for electing studies preparatory to his professional work, 
or that his professional course should help constitute the requirements for an academic 
degree. The latter plan has been adopted by a few institutions. But in objection 
to this the question may be asked, What special reason is there why the practitioner 
of medicine should receive an academic degree at allif he can not obtain it in the 
regular way? If he is not to receive the training and knowledge which the colle- 
giate course is designed to give, then the degree would be misleading and deceptive 
and therefore objectionable; although it may be said that his medical training 
develops his mental faculties in the same way as collegiate studies, it is answered 
that he receives the M. D. degree for the completion of the medical course and that 
it should not entitle him to double distinetion. If so, why should not the medical 
student take an extended course in purely medical education and then receive the 
three degrees, A. B., Ph. D., and M. D.? There would be one advantage in this: he 
would not spend one-half his life preparing for the other half. He could complete 
his secondary course at 18 or 19 years of age, his medical course at 25 or 26, and still 
be able to enter upon the practice of his profession with honors heaped upon him. 
* Another plan has also been adopted by some institutions to enable medical students 
to enter earlier upon the practice of their profession. In about one-fourth the 
medical schools of the United States students who are graduates in arts or science 
are allowed to enter upon the second year of the medical course, thus completing 
the course one year earlier than nongraduates. 
“The average age of students who enter the Harvard academic department has 
been gradually rising during the whole of this century, until it has reached nearly 
19 years. The student who enters the medical school, therefore, finds himself just 
beginning the preparation of the real work of his life at an age when many of his 
contemporaries are already engaged in the productive work of their professions. In 
Germany the best class of students begin their professional studies ata little earlier 
age than that at which our young men enter Harvard College. As the course of 
study leading to the degree of doctor of medicine lasts five years, it follows that the 
German physician is ready to begin practice before he is 23} years old.”! 
Says President Eliot in his report of 1892-93: 
“The professional schools ‘are demanding longer and longer periods of study; and 
this demand, coupled with the improvement in the secondary schools, makes it more 
and more natural, and for young men of small means even necessary, to go direct 
from secondary schools to professional schools.” 
Here it seems that the young men, when they find it necessary to curtail the time 
required, have omitted or abbreviated the college course, holding that their early 
training should be full and accurate, a good foundation, but that as their professional 
attainment will form the basis of their lifework and determine its success, it should 
be the last to be idged. 
    
            ‘Dr. J. C. Warren.  
-P-A-G-E-409
MEDICAL EDUCATION. 1627 
  In considering the subject of medical education it is well to remember that all 
students can not be expected to pursue the same stereotyped course of study; insome 
cases the limitations of age or of finances would compel the student to seek the nearest 
entrance to the practice of medicine, while in other cases the student would be able 
and desire to obtain first a full general education and then to spare neither time nor 
money in obtaining a thorough and accurate medical training, so that he would be 
able te practice his profession with that satisfaction to himself which only skillful 
training can furnish. There must of necessity be two standards of medical educa- 
tion; a minimum standard, to which all students are required to attain, and a max- 
imum or ideal standard, to which all students should desire to attain if possible. 
The first simply requires that the student shall have received a full secondary or 
high school education, then an attendance upon three full courses of lectures, and the 
passing of an examination in each branch of study. This course will be taken by 
those whose age or financial condition prevents the possibility of a more extended 
training. 
The ideal course is the one mentioned on a preceding page, a full secondary educa- 
tion by 19 years of age, the completion of a regular four years’ collegiate course by 
23, then four years in a medical college and one or two years in a hospital, the 
student not beginning practice until 30 years of ag Of course many students can 
not take this ideal course, but there are many who will, and especially will those 
who expect to seek practice in the large cities endeavor to comply with it. Those 
schools whose graduates go mainly to rural districts and villages will probably 
receive the larger number of students taking a short course, while other schools 
possessing large endowment funds, and independent of tuition fees, especially those 
schools which constitute departments in the old and well-established universities 
where can be found every appliance for complete laboratory investigation, will be 
sought by those students desiring to receive the fullest medical training; while the 
large body of medical students will seek an intermediate plane between the two 
extremes, but each year approaching nearer to the highest standard. Of course the 
number of students pursuing the extensive course above mentioned is not large at 
present, but as the country becomes more densely populated and as the candidates for 
professional honors are increasing rapidly, only those who have received full prepar- 
ation can long expect to compete successfully for medical practice. 
  WOMEN IN THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, 
It is well known that in America woman has a wider, more independent, and more 
remunerative sphere of work than in any other part of the globe.. In fact, there 
are but few callings here in which she has not at least a few representatives. Although 
there is a greater demand here for “ woman’s rights” and probably more conventions 
are held to secure them than in any other part of the world, still it is to America 
that they ever look for the nearest approach to the ideal condition of woman. The 
greater freedom has whetted the appetite for still wider fields. But when we con- 
sider that some of the most skillful and eminent authorities on medical subjects 
have been women, we need not be surprised that they are still engaged in the 
work. When a Lachapelle and a Boivin have gone before, their followers are sure 
to be coming after. During the year 1892-93 there were 1,302 women enrolled as 
students in the various medical schools of the United States, including 64 students 
not reported in time to be tabulated. Women were enrolled in 61 medical schools 
as follows:

-P-A-G-E-410
    1628 EDUCATION REPORT, 1899-93. ~ 
There are in the United States 7 schools for the medical education of women 
exclusively. One of these, the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, has an 
enrollment of 210 students. There were also 161 women studying the cognate sub- 
jects pharmacy (98) and dentistry (63), not mentioning the 42 engaged in the study 
of law. : 
Taking three years as the average length of time required for graduation, and 
making some allowance for students dropping out, there would be about 300 medical 
students in the graduating classes, or 3,000 women in the last ten years licensed to 
practice. According to the Census bulletin giving the statistics of occupations in 
1890, there were in the United States 4,555 women physicians and surgeons, out of a 
total number of 104,803 physicians and surgeons.    
A French compiler, M. Marcel Baudouin, furnishes a résumé of the legal status of 
women in the medical profession in various countries, in which, singularly enough, 
he omits all but the merest mention of the gentler sex in France. According to M. 
Baudouin, women are rigidly excluded from the advantages of a university educa- 
tion in Germany, and consequently may not become candidates in any medical exam- 
ination. ‘It naturally follows that no medical woman can be the possessor of a 
certificate carrying with it the slightest value in Germany,” since a State license 
upon examination is necessary to practice in that country. In Austria-Hungary the 
situation is even worse; there the admission of women to higher grade instruction 
is formally forbidden by law. Spain is quite as bad; in fact, the difficulties are said 
to be even greater in the Iberian Peninsula than in Germany and Austria. In Eng- 
land, Ireland, and Scotland the universities—through which lies the registration 
necessary to the right to practice—are now all thrown open to women, Scotland hay- 
ing been the last to yield to the new order of ideas. In Ireland, however, while a 
woman is afforded every facility for obtaining a medical qualification, she may not 
fill any public office under the State. Similarly in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark 
the medical career is open to all without distinction of sex, save in the matter of 
State appointments. In Belgium, Holland, and Roumania the broadest views pre- 
vail regarding the medical rights of women; they may do and be, as physicians, all 
that men can and are, cwteris paribus, which they are not. The right of women to 
practice is fully recognized in Italy, and a woman occupies the chair of histology in 
the medical faculty of Bologna. 
In 1893 there were 308 women attending medical lectures in Zurich, Geneva, Berne, 
Basle, and Lausanne, but there are only 10 women practicing in Switzerland. After 
raduating the students return to their own countries to practice, principally in 
ussia, In this latter country, Russia, there were 546 women practitioners in 1893, 
and women are there allowed by law to become assistant surgeons in all railway 
administrations; in 1880 a special medical school for women, after the American 
model, was established in Moscow. Universities in many of the English colonies 
have been open to women since 1875, and in France women first obtained foothold 
in_a university in 1863, but five years later there were only 4 female students in 
VEcole de Medecine of Paris; the more beautiful women of a most beautiful country 
do not seem to take kindly to the practice of physic, notwithstanding the illustrious 
examples of Mesdames Lachappelle, Bourgeois, and Boivin, concerning whom it 
has been said that ‘‘if their mantle could be made to fall on the shoulders of their 
sisters of the present generation, female delicacy would be saved many a rude shock 
and the cause of science would in no sense suffer.” M. Baudouin concludes with the 
following tribute to this country: 
“Only a moment’s consideration of the following statistics is necessary to convince 
an inquirer that he must proceed to the United States of North America if he wants 
to study effectually the question of medical women. According to a statistical 
report drawn up by M. Louis Frank, of Brussels, there were in 1893 on the other 
side of the Atlantic fully 2,000 women practicing medicine in one or other of its 
forms, and inclusive of 130 homeopaths ‘The majority were general practitioners, 
but there were also 70 hospital physicians or surgeons; 95.professors in the schools; 
610 specialists for the diseases of women; 70 alienists; 65 orthopedists; 40 oculists 
and aurists; and, finally, 30 electro-therapeutists. In Canada there is but 1 medical 
school exclusively for women, but in 1893 there were 10 such in the United States.”!

MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
HIGHER MEDICAL EDUCATION. 
  By Dr. Witt1aM H. Wetcu, professor of pathology in Johns Hopkins University. 
[From Western Reserve Medical Journal.] 
The time has come when the need of medical education should be brought forcibly 
before the general public in this country. Medicine can no longer be taught with 
the simple appliances of former times. ‘The proper teaching of medicine now requires 
hospitals, many laboratories with an expensive equipment, and a large force of 
teachers, some of whom must be paid enough to enable them to devote their whole 
time to teaching and investigating. These things require large endowments of 
money, and can not be adequately secured simply from the fees of students. If the 
public desires good physicians it must help to make them. 
In this country, for the most part, we can not look to the State for endowment of 
medical education, but we must appeal to private beneficence. A few public-spirited 
and generous men and women have already given practical proof of their apprecia- 
tion of these facts. With more general and fuller realization of the needs and present 
condition of medical education, and of the results which can be secured by its liberal 
endowment, there is every reason to believe that these benefactions will be largely 
and rapidly, increased, and that thereby the condition of medical education in ‘this 
country shall cease to be a reproach to us. During the lust few years our methods 
and standards of medical teaching have shown remarkable improvement. * 
What preparation should a student bring to the study of medicine? It is highly 
desirable, in my judgment, that he should be liberally educated; that is, that he 
should possess a degree in arts or science which shall be an index of that knowledge 
and culture which, apart from any immediate bearing upon professional studies, are 
recognized as entitling their possessor to be ranked among liberally educated men. 
Scientific studies have acquired the right to rank with classical studies in affording 
this liberal culture, but the humanities should have a fair share of attention at this 
period of education. 
The question has been discussed whether or not during the period of collegiate 
education the studént who intends to study medicine should be required to pursue 
any special subjects, and especially such as bear a direct relation to his future profes- 
sional studies. The answer to this question seems to me to depend upon the charac- 
ter of collegiate training on the one hand and of medical training on the other. The 
primary purpose of collegiate education is to furnish a broad basis of mental disci- 
pline and liberal cultureindependently of direct relation to professional work. Where, 
as in the old-fashioned college in this country and in the gymnasia and lycées of Ger- 
many and France, the student enters college at the age of 15 or 16 and is graduated 
at 19 or 20, it is not necessary or even desirable that the ' undergraduate student should 
specialize his work with reference to his future profession. Under these circum- 
stances, which obtain in most foreign universities, at least the first year of medical 
study is devoted mainly to physics, chemistry, and zoology, including comparative 
anatomy. 
These are not, however, the conditions which prevail in this country at the present 
time, where on the one hand the average age of graduation from our best colleges is 
at least two years later than in Germany and France, and on the other hand the med- 
ical schools do not furnish adequate training in physics, general chemistry, and 
biology, whereas these sciences are now generally included in the curricula of our 
colleges. When we consider the fundamental importance of these sciences for the 
study of medicine, the advanced age of graduation from college, and the special 
conditions of collegiate and medical education in this country, it seems to me clear 
that during the period of collegiate study the student intending to study medicine 
should acquire a fair knowledge of chemistry, physics, and general biology, and to 
these sciences should be added the study of French and German. Inability to read 
French and German deprives the physician of personal acquaintance with a large 
part of the most valuable literature of his profession, and makes it impossible for him 
to keep thoroughly abreast with the progress of medical science and art. * * * 
‘There are certain points which should be clearly understood as regards the require- 
ment that the preliminary education of a medical student should be a liberal one, 
indicated by a degree in arts or science, and should be made to include a specified 
amount and kind of know ledge of physics, nee , and biology, with a reading 
knowledge of French and German. The justification for the latter requirement is 
that inasmuch as students are kept at college in this country two years longer than 
in most foreign countries they should be permitted to pursue during at least the 
last two years of their course subjects which bear upon the study of medicine, but 
which, although included in the medical curriculum in foreign universities, are 
strictly liberal studies independent of their professional bearing. These sciences, 
preliminary to medical study, can be studied and taught better in the college than

  in the medical school, and, indeed, in foreign universities they are more often pur- 
sued by medical students in the philosophical than in the medical faculty. It would 
bea waste of energy and money to make provision for them in both the medical and 
the academical departments. : 
It can not be truthfully said that the plan indicated need to divert the preliminary 
education from a liberal to a technical and specialized one, for the degree in arts or 
science will presumably indicate that the student has a liberal education and the 
special subjects need not be taken up before the last two years of the course. The 
scheme presupposes that the student will have made up his mind to study medicine 
in time to include these special subjects in his undergraduate studies. If he has not 
done so, or if he chooses to exclude them from his collegiate work, he will be obliged 
to devote at least a year to them after graduation and before beginning the study of 
medicine. The college authorities should, however, direct attention at the proper 
period of the course to the importance of these subjects for those who intend to 
study medicine. 
This plan, moreover, adjusts medical education to existing conditions of collegiate 
education in this country without any essential changes in the curriculum of the 
latter. 
_ The advanced age of graduation from college is a serious embarrassment to higher 
medical education in this country, and has led to the unfortunate result that with 
the increase in the time required for the study of medicine there has been a falling off 
in the number of medical students with a college degree in at least one of our leading 
medical schools, although it can not be doubted that the average amount of prelim- 
inary education has increased among our medical students. 
Various suggestions have been made, especially by the medical faculties of our 
universities, to remedy this anomalous condition of collegiate education, or to adapt 
it to the needs of medical education. I think that we may assume that the college 
course is not likely to be shortened, or that the college will relinquish that part of 
its development which has made it something between the old college and a univer- 
sity. There is good reason to believe that there are serious defects in our systems of 
primary and secondary education, and that without lowering the standard of admis- 
sion, better methods of teaching will enable students to enter college at least a year 
younger than is now the case. 
The plan has been adopted in some of our colleges of permitting students to begin 
their medical studies in the medical department atthe beginning of the senior year. 
This is a plan whichis applicable only where there is a medical school in connection 
with the college, and involves certain sufficiently apparent difficulties, I think, how- 
ever, there is much to be said in favor of this arrangement, which permits the student 
to take up the study of human anatomy, physiology, and physiological chemistry in 
his senior year in college, provided he has sufficient preliminary training in the 
fundamental sciences which have been mentioned. It may, however, be questioned 
whether the time available for the study of physics, chemistry, and general biology 
in college is any too long for this purpose, and will permit the addition of human 
anatomy with dissections and other subjects which must be a part of the regular 
medical curriculum. Unless the student has completed the work of one year of 
the medical course I do not see the justification of permitting him to shorten by one 
year the regular medical course because he has a college degree. 
It should be understood that if a medical school requires for admission a year’s 
collegiate training in physics, chemistry, and biology, subjects which are included 
in the medical curriculum of European universities, its period of medical study is, 
according to European standards, lengthened by one year, the first year being rele- 
gated to the collegiate period. 
The only medical school in this country where a liberal degree is required for 
admission is that of Johns Hopkins University. Here it is also required, for reasons 
which have been stated, that the candidate for admission shall be able to read French 
and German, and shall have had a year’s collegiate training with laboratory work 
in physics, chemistry, and biology. It is, of course, impossible for unendowed 
medical schools to demand anything approaching these conditions for admission. I 
do not undertake to say that even were other medica] schools so situated that they 
could demand them it would be wise for them to do so under present conditions, 
but it seems to me that there is room in this country for at least a few medical 
schools with such a standard. Exactly what is feasible to require as a general 
standard for admission to medical schools in this country at the present time is a 
subject which, as already said, I do not consider at this time. 
It is true that without a liberal education a man may become a competent physi- 
cian, and may attain even a high standard of excellence in his profession, but with 
such education he is better adapted for the study of medicine, he is more likely to 
succeed in his profession, his social position will be better, and his life will be 
MELE sors 
How long should be the period of undergraduate study in a medical school? In 
Europe it is nowhere less than four years, and in most European countries it is 
     
-P-A-G-E-413
  MEDICAL EDUCATION. 1631 
Jonger. In Sweden it is nine or ten’ Fears; in Spain, seven years; in Jtaly, and 
Holla nd, six years; in Austria, Russia, Portugal, and several universities of Great 
Britain, ‘five years; in Germany, four and a half years. In Canada the required 
period is four years. * 
The required period of study at the medical department of the Johns Hopkins 
University, where a full year of collegiate training with laboratory work in physics, 
chemistry, and biology is required for admission, is, according to European stand- 
ards, at least five years. 
Four years of undergraduate medical study in a medical school, each year being the 
usunlacademic year of about eight months, are as much as can reasonably be demanded 
in this country at the present time. This length of time is sufficient if the student 
enters with a satisfactory preliminary training, especially if, as is often the case, he 
supplements the undergraduate course with a year or a year and a half in a hospital 
or a year of special graduate study. 
Only those medical schools which have good laboratory and hospital facilities are 
warranted in establishing a four years’ obligatory cour: It would be absurd for 
some medical schools, w ith their pathetically meager outfit, to require the student 
to remain with them four years. 
    AMERICAN AND GERMAN MEDICAL STUDENTS. 
Dr. F. B. Mattory in Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, July 5, 1894. 
The latter, after about nine years of hard drill in the gymnasium, which covers 
most of the ground of the American preparatory school and college, is ready at the 
age of about 19 years to enter the university, the most democratic institution of 
the Old World, for every professor and privat docent is wholly independent, and 
may give such instruction as he will. The German State system of universities 
has many advantages over the independent institutions in our own country. The 
requirements of all are the same, and they are run interchangeably, so that the stu- 
dents form a vast floating population in the university towns. They can hear the 
best men in the various subjects or in the same subject. They can spend their win- 
ters in the large cities’ like Berlin and Vienna, and their summers in towns like 
Heidelberg or Freiberg, where the surrounding mountains and forests offer oppor- 
tunities for delightful tramps. Thus they see more of the world and obtain broader 
views than they can from living in one place all the time, for no one university can 
get the best men in every subject. They can also elect the university at which they 
will take their examination. 
THE AMERICAN AND GERMAN GRADUATE IN MEDICINE. 
Doctors of medicine in Germany are, as a body, better educated than our men at 
home. They have all been through the gymnasium, and have spent at least five 
years in the study of medicine. They are ready to enter practice (if they do not go 
into hospital work) at about the age of 24. Our men at home who have been through 
Harvard College and then four years in the medical school have undoubtedly received 
a broader training than the men here, but they are not ready to enter practice until 
about the age of 37. 
The reason our college men enter the medical school about four years later (at 
the age of 23) than the men here is probably due in part to the following causes: 
They cover more ground than is gone over in the gymnasium. . Their education pre- 
vious to entering college has consumed more time than was necessary. American 
independence shows itself at a disadvantage at present in her educational institu- 
tions. There is a lack of harmony and of uniformity between them, even between 
the colleges and universities. Each has its own ideas, aims, and standards. The 
public schools especially are run with too little reference to the requirements of 
the higher educational institutions of the country. They seek to furnish in them- 
selves a complete education of a certain degree. The desire or the possibility of 
attending college is often. realized for the first time when this early education is 
nearly completed, and valuable time has been lost in learning what was unnecessary 
for this or that college, and more time must be spent in getting up the extra work 
required. 
The proposition is being at present agitated in Germany of allowing students who 
are going g into medicine to study French, English, and the natural sciences in the 
gymnasium, instead of the classics as heretofore, a step similar to the broader one 
already taken at Harvard. 
Of the four and a half years that a German student spends in the study of medi- 
cine the first two years are devoted to six subjects—chemistry, physics, botany, 
zoology, anatomy, and physiology. That leaves three years for the rest of his medi- 
cal education, the same length of time devoted in the Harvard Medical School to 
   
-P-A-G-E-414
  1632 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the same branches, namely, pathology, clinical medicine, etc. It is proposed, how- 
ever, to make the course for M. D. in the German universities six years instead of five 
(the last year to be devoted to practical work), in order to raise the age of the medi- 
cal graduates. 
With regard to the study of medicine the German universities possess the great 
advantage that both the universities and the hospitals are State institutions. Conse- 
quently the medical department and the hospital are very closely identified and 
work in perfect harmony, The visiting staff of the hospital are the clinical instruct- 
ors of the medical school. The pathological institute likewise stands in the closest 
relationship to the hospital; indeed, forms a very important part of it. Its duty is 
to solve all problems that are doubtful clinically, to correct.errors of diagnosis, and 
to render clear the cause and nature of every diseased process, so that it may be 
treated intelligently. The pathological department of a hospital thus conducted 
becomes of inestimable advantage, alike to the patients and to those whose mission 
it is to heal them.

CHAPTER VIII. 
EDUCATION IN THE VARIOUS STATES, 
ALABAMA. 
AN EDUCATIONAL CAMPAIGN, 
  In the spring of 1893 an organized and systematic effort was made by the State 
superintendent of public instruction, Hon. J. G. Harris, to interest more fully the 
people of Alabama in the subject of general and popular education. Under his 
energetic lead a vigorous campaign was inaugurated. A programme was arranged 
for the holding of five public meetings in each county in the State by the county 
superintendent of education, to which, meetings all the white people were invited. 
The meetings were designed ‘to be emphatically nonpolitical and nonsectarian. The 
design was to gather together all classes and creeds and political parties, for the 
purpose of exchanging views and opinions in reference to the public school ques- 
tion. The 1st of September was appointed as a day for holding a mass meeting at 
the court-house of each county, to close up the canvass. 
“T suggest,” said State Superintendent Harris, in‘a circular to the county super- 
intendents, ‘‘that you enlist, at an early day, every teacher in your county in behalf of 
this movement. In consultation with the teachers and citizens, select the most suit- 
able places for holding these meetings, and insist on the people providing a basket 
dinner, that they may spend the entire day in considering the various educational 
interests. Encourage all the people to come out and join in the important work. 
You will call on your editors and newspaper men, and secure their cooperation.” 
These meetings were forthe white people. It is proposed to hold at another time, 
conventions for the colored people. 
_ Inorder that those who took part in the campaign might have some idea of the 
scope and nature of the subject to be treated, the State superintendent prepared 
the following list of topics for discussion : 
(1) The duty of the State to provide ways and means for the support of the public 
schools. 
(2) The obligation of the cit schools, 
(3) The education of the people the surest protection to constitutional government. 
(4) The natural and moral duty of the parent to educate the child to the extent 
of his ability. 
(5) The x: geht of the child to an education commensurate with his surroundings. 
(6) The character of the teacher socially, morally, and intellectually. 
(7) Male and female teachers, their success in the ‘schoolroom. 
(8) The right and duty of the teacher to govern and discipline his pupils. 
(9) The importance of good school buildings with the modern improvements. 
(10) Coeducation; should it be encouraged? 
(11) Ought the State to provide by law for local or general taxation, or either, 
for the support of public schools. 
(12) Is it the State’s duty to see that the children are educated? 
(13) What should be the qualifications of a State and county superintendent of. 
education? 
(14) Duties of the county board of education as to the examination and licensing 
of teachers, and its vital importance. 
(15) Duties of township trustees and the responsibilities resting upon GRO 
ought there to be one or more foreach township? 
(16) The importance and beneficial results of well-regulated teachers’ institutes. 
(17) The duty of parents to supplement the public fund, thereby lengthening the 
school term.

(18) Should the State adopt a uniform series of text-books for public schools for 
either State or county 
,19) Ought not in salaries of county super intendents be increased, that they may 
give more time to school work? 
(20) Do the public school laws of tho State need revising and should the con- 
stitution be amended in reference thereto? 
(21) Ought industrial departments for both sexes be attached to public schools? 
The following address of the State superintendent was read at every meeting in 
connection with the other exercises: 
AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF A N. G. HARRIS, STATE SUP 
  “BADIES AND FE : Though absent in person, I am with you in 
spirit and interest. 
“The occasion that has called you together is one of supreme importance. You 
have left your homes and come to this “gathering for a purpose, It is a social, 
friendly, business mass meoting, composed of our own citizens, who love their coun- 
try, and whose aim and object is to improve the condition of our people and promote 
the welfare of this grand old Commonwealth, by discussing important cducational 
questions, which pertain to our future prosperity and happiness. 
“ Profoundly impressed with the educational necessities and demands of Alabama, 
and believing as we do that all children in the State should be to some extent 
educated, you have come to talk over these matters, take a full survey of the situa- 
tion, discuss the various duties and responsibilities resting upon the State, the 
parent, the people, and set in motion as best you can such measures as will, in 
your judgment, better our condition, augment our educational facilities, and add to 
our progress ¢ and higher dev elopment in government, in morals, and in mind. 
“The main purpose of this meeting is to excite a deeper interest in the minds and 
consciences of our people regarding general education, and to exchange and inter- 
change views, impressions, and opinions on the various questions that pertain to 
our public- school system. In order to determine intelligently and accurately what 
are the best measures to adopt in carrying ont any department or pol. of govern- 
ment, it is proper that the whole people be consulted, and every conflicting argu- 
ment and opinion given its proper weight, that a just conclusion may be reached. 
“Thero is scarcely any question of ethics, of science, or government but what has 
two sides to it, and each side its supporters and adherents. Men may differ very 
widely in their conclusions of what is right, and the proper remedies to correct a 
wrong, and at the same time be conscientious and patriotic in their differences. 
“This is a government which guarantees to every man an undisturbed right to 
form his own opinions and express his own views. Men may indorse the theory and 
principle of any system of government, and at the same time differ as to the prac- 
tical operations of such government, the machinery that controls and directs. To 
simplify this assertion, we say, individuals and parties may be strictly conscientious 
in their views and convictions of this or that policy, and maintain such views with 
vehemence and unswerving fidelity, and at the same time be inerror. Neither men, 
parties, nor governments are infallible. There is an admixture of error running 
through all human plans. Henee, as citizens, honestly and earnestly striving te 
arrive at just conceptions of law, and system, and duties, and the best means through 
which the greatest, highest, and most beneficial results may be accomplished, it is 
eminently proper that ali classes and professions and vocations should be heard, 
and have their opinions duly weighed and considered. 
“Every citizen in this Commonwealth, however obseure or humble, has rights that 
must be scrupulously regarded and respected. Every voter is a component part of 
the State government, and has some part in the control and management of the 
coordinate branches of the same. He has a right to hisopinions, and may maintain 
them in argument or at the ballot box. Such being the form of govenment under 
which we live, and the people being the support and maintenance of it, it is but 
“the part of wisdom that every citizen should have the privilege to express his views 
in coming to a proper solution of all disputed questions of State or !ederal policy. 
Acting upon this principle, and guided by a sense of justice and right, meetings 
have been called all over this State to diseuss the public-school question and educa- 
tion in general, and to getourpeople fully aroused and enlightened on these subjects. 
All politics, partisanship, and sectarianism must be severely ignored. The good of 
the children, the good ot the State, the well-being of society, and the perpetuation 
of our Government are the aims and purposes of your meeting to-day. 
“Tt is said, ‘that in the multitude of counsel there is safety.’ If this wise maxim 
be true, it occurs to me that in no way can we better secure safety and pretection 
from error and mistakes, than in a free, full, fraternal, and patriotic discussion of. 
the various questions submitted for your investigation.

“Let no one be criticised for holding to this or that theory, but in proper respect 
let argument answer, not harsh denunciation. My views may be impracticabl 
and totally at variance with the spirit of our public schools, yet they are my views, 
my convictions, and if I am in error, let solid argument, uttered in kindness and 
generousness, be invoked to convince me of such error. Let us hear every side, 
every argument, that we may finally arrive, if possible, at a just conclusion of every 
question, every theory. 
“No sane man will deny this fact, that our children are the central thought and 
object ef our secular and social life, and of right ought to be. God in his wisdom 
‘has intrusted them to our care, and the highest duty we owe to humanity is to care 
for, properly train, and educate these God-given jewels. To disregard these solemn 
obligations, parental care and sacred devotion to our loved ones, is to fall below the 
beasts of the field and the fowls of the air; for they care for and nurture their young, 
and carry out the instincts which God planted in their breasts. If this be true of 
the lower animals, how much more should it be true of man, created as he is in the 
image and likeness of his Maker. * * * 
“Tn view of th t, when all nations fostering the principles of civilization are 
more or less demanding the development of the hnman mind of all the people, would 
it not be the part of wisdom, patriotism, and statesmanship for us to pause and ask 
the vital question, ‘What are we doing to educate the children of our land, the 
children: of the State?’ I donotadvocate compulsory laws. Our people can not be 
driven, but they can be persuaded by legitimate argument. I have but little respect 
for that people who have to be forced by pain and penalties to perform so great a 
moraland natural duty. While it is true twenty-seven States of this Union have 
on their statute books compulsory laws requiring every parent to educate his child 
to a certain degree in the elementary branches, the State paying for the tuition, yet 
I am not sure this systemis in keeping with the character, the temper, the genius 
of the genuine American citizen, or the principles of oursystem of government. 
I sincerely trust that the people of Alabama will never so far forget their duty to 
their children as to require penal statutes to force them to comply with parental 
duties. I have an abiding confidence in the integrity, patriotism, and loyalty of the 
people of this State. All we demand is to show us our duty and we will faithfully 
discharge it. * * * 
«4 short while ago, I think in May last, at a meeting of the Farmers’ Alliance in 
Shelby County, the committee on education made a report in which they used these 
significant words: ‘We nrust earnestly insist upon the necessity of educating the 
masses of the people, believing that the uneducated are always at the mercy of the 
better informed, and we insist that the brotherhood should take more interest in the 
cause of education, so that by means of their own efforts they secure to their children 
the blessings of education.’ 
“The amendment te the constitution, as proposed by the last general assembly, 
and will be submitted to the voters at the next general election, provides for local 
taxation for public schools. Before we can have such taxation, this amendment, or 
one similar to it, must be passed. It makes ample provision for the passage of such 
laws as will give the relief desired by our people. In the cities, towns, and villages 
under municipal regulations the authorities have power to raise revenue for the 
support of public schools. ‘The people im the townships, in the county, have no such 
power, and can not have it unless the constitution is amended so as to delegate this 
authority to them. This done, and they can raise a revenue by which their schools 
will be kept in operation for nine months. Such is the aim and purpose of the 
Hundley amendment, and which, if passed, will secure all the advantages that can 
be desired. 
“Our system is a good one, with some exceptions that can be easily corrected by 
legislation. More money, longer school period, more trained teachers, and better 
schoolhouses, with proper equipments, and we will soon be in the forefront of prog- 
ress. The day dawn of a new educational era is breaking in upon us, and the time 
is near at hand when illiteracy will be a thing of the past and our civilization will 
continue to rise higher in the scale of enlightenment.” * * * 
        
     
    
   
  In a report made to the governor of Alabama, under date of November 13, 1893, — 
the State superintendent announces that more than 100,000 people attended the 
meetings, and over 800 speeches were made on the subject of education. In one 
county alone six mass meetings were held. More general interest was manifested 
in the country districts than ever before, and the schools of the State opened with a 
larger attendance than in any previous year, notwithstanding the pressure of hard 
times; also more school buildings were erected than at any previous period. 
To reap the fruits growing out of this enterprise the State superintendent inti- 
mates that ‘‘it is necessary that the campaign, so auspiciously inaugurated, be car- 
ried on annually in some form or other, opening new avenues of thought, creating 
new methods and systems by which to reach a greater degree of success. It is the 
most important work in the State. It is not routine work, as some suppose, it

demands progress and development. To accomplish the proper results will require 
zeal, energy, and constant labor of every school officer. Means and agencies must 
be invented or discovered or formulated through which to reach the masses of the 
people, hence, constant watchfulness, study, and labor is necessary.” 
CONNECTICUT. 
REPORT OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION ON THE CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS 
OF NEW HAVEN COUNTY. 
[The following report calls attention to some of the results of an investigation 
into the true condition of the schools of New Haven County, Conn This report 
may be considered as a noteworthy document. The investigation was of the most 
searching, methodical, and thorough character, the methods of procedure admira- 
ble, and the results calculated to put the public on their guard against reposing too 
great confidence in the conduct of the schools. The facts disclosed are of value in 
bringing to notice the ineffectiveness of the instruction in many schools, and the 
causes of the same, while the methods by which more satisfactory results are to be 
obtained are indicated. The detailed record of the dnvestigation, with numerous 
facsimiles of examination papers, is contained in the 1893 report of Hon, C. D. Hine, 
secretary of the board.] 
The first legal duty of this board is to ‘‘ascertain and keep informed as to the 
condition and progress of the public schools in the State;” its second and correlated 
duty is to ‘‘ apprise the general assembly of the true condition, progress, and needs 
of public education.” = 
It is the obvious intention of these provisions of law to charge the board with 
constant oversight of the working of the common school system, in order that they, 
and through them the legislature and the people of the State, may know whether 
said system is producing the results for which it is maintained. It is not the busi- 
ness of the board to make out a case for the common school system, neither should 
we be justified in maintaining silence concerning faulty buildings or bad instruction. 
If it was proclaimed that everything is hopeful and prosperous, without a close 
examination of the facts, a delusion might be prolonged as to the real character of 
the schools, from which the children would be the sufferers. 
It would be pleasant to dwell upon the excellent schools here and there, whose 
merits are great and obvious. In these proficiency is attained in the common 
branches, and what is infinitely more important and satisfactory, the intellectual 
life of the children is stimulated. But it is those which do not reach a high stand- 
ard of merit to which attention is above all demanded. 
In executing the duties laid upon them by the provisions of law above quoted, the 
board has caused a thorough investigation to be made of the schools of New Haven 
County. The results of this investigation are shown in detail in the report of the 
secretary. Only the most important general results are here indicated. 
I. In too many schools, sometimes in all the schools in a town, children at 12 and over 
do not know more than children at 8 can easily know. 
The result in one town having six schools was as follows: 
(1) There were 37 children over 10 years of age; the average age of these 
children was over 12. All had attended public school more than six 
years. 
(2) Ten did not add correctly 9-5; 17-+-9; 36-9. 
(3) Twelve did not subtract correctly 25—8; 11—4. - 
(4) Ten did not give correctly 7x8; 6x7; 9X8; 7x12. 
(5) Twelve did not tell how many 9s in 54; 3s in 27; 6s in 18. 
(6) Thirty-five did not add correctly $-+4; 4+4. 
(7) Thirteen did not add correctly the following: 
245 
78 
669 
15 
201 
(8) Nineteen did not multiply correctly 604 x29. 
(9) Fifteen did not divide correctly 546 by 3. 
(10) Nineteen did not work correctly the following example: It is now ten 
minutes after 10, what time was it five minutes ago? 
(11) A larger number did not work correctly the following example: A school- 
room is 6 yards and 2 feet long. How many feet long is it? 
(12) A still larger number did not work the following example: A man uses 
124 envelopes in a month. How many will*he use in six months?

  _ _ In both oral and written work there was practically no time limit and the chil- 
dren could use such helps in counting as they had at hand. 
They were asked to write at dictation a few sentences, with the following result: 
(1) Thirty did not begin their sentences with capital letters. 
(2) Sixteen did not begin proper names with capital letters. 
(3) Twelve did not use the capital “I.” 
(4) Thirty did not use the interrogation point correctly. 
(5) Twenty-eight did not use the period. 
(6) Thirty-two did not use the apostrophe with the possessive case. 
(7) Thirty-seven did not use quotation marks. 
Spelling had been taught from a spelling book in which the children were learning 
words of three to five syllables. 
The following ten words were given out to each of the 37 children. Of the 370 
words, 248 were spelled incorrectly, 
busy comb eyes > goes eggs 
cents sugar collar to-day such 
They had studied spelling, but could not spell in the only place where spelling 
is useful—on paper. 
Not more than five papers exhibited penmanship which was tolerable. 
These children had learned their letters and a few words, but could not read. 
They had been allowed to use one book in a year as a reading book. The younger 
children could repeat from memory the words of the reading book if it were opened 
and they were started. They had not gained the ability to read intelligently any 
book suited to their capacity. The school furnished themno opportunity nor incen- 
tive to read. 
They had studied arithmetic and could not manage the simplest operations in 
arithmetic. 
They had studied grammar and could not write a single sentence correctly. Not 
one of the papers in this town showed acquaintance with “the art of speaking and 
writing the English language correctly.” \ 
In the six schools in this town there was not a single book, map, or globe, and not 
more than 60 square feet of blackboard. 
If this were a single or an exceptional case it might be attributed to peculiar cir- 
cumstances and difficulties. The sole cause here and elsewhere is: 
These children have not been well taught. 
A pertinent question is: 
Has the money of the town been well expended that has produced no greater result than 
this? The loss of money is quite insignificant in comparison with the loss of time to 
which these children have been subjected. Six years of their lives have been elab- 
orately thrown away. The school system in operation for six years has turned out chil- 
dren at 12 whose education is not equal to what an ordinary child can acquire at 8. 
The misfortune can not be fully estimated until we realize what might have been 
accomplished in these active years. 
In order to show what may be done we give the following case: 
In another school the average age is 8 years and 7 months, and most of the chil- 
dren have been in school two years; a few two years and a half. 
In one year the children have read the following books in school: 
  Pratts’ U. S. History, No. 1. Irving: 
Eggleston’s History. Sketch Book; History of New York. 
Greek Heroes, Kingsley: 
Fables and Folk Stories. Greek Heroes; Water Babies.

  The following was their work in arithmetic: 
Numbers dey eloped from 45 to 144; multiplication; division; problems combining 
first four processes, in Popular Educator Arithmetic and Peck’s New Arithmetic; 
linear measure; dry measure; liquid nee Arsh of square measure; objective 
work, oral drill and problems \with 4, 4,454, 44,4, 4; fitst case in per centayre. 
The same test which was given to the thirty- -seven children above was given to 
this school, numbering forty, except that they were not allowed in the oral work 
any time to count. 
(1) All added correctly 9+5; 17 “35S 9; 38+ 9. 
(2) Three did not subtract 25-8; 
(3) Four did not multiply 7 x 8; cs x 33 SCS. CA 
(4) Five did not give correctly the namber of 98 in 545 "38 in 27; 6s in 18. 
(5) Al added correctly 3 $+4;44+ 
These children looked with contempt ‘at the example, “It is now ten minutes after 
10, what time was it five minutes ago?” 
inE nglish the following was the “result: 
(1) Au began sentences with capital letters. 
(2) AH began proper names with capital letters. 
(8) All used capitals for the pronoun “I.” 
(4) Ten did not use the interrogation point correctly. 
(5) All used the apostrophe correctly. 
(6) All used the period correctly. 
(7) Ten did not use the quotation marks correctly. 
The result in this case is due to good teaching. 
The contrast is between. children at 12 who have not gained the elements of @ common 
school education and children who at 8 years and 7 months have secured this education. 
In this connection it is important to consider those children who from one cause 
and another do not remain in school until they are 12 or 14. Under this dawdling 
systeni most do not get further than the primary school. Last year in one town 58h 
entered the primary “schools. In the grammar schools, representing the eighth year, 
there were 98. The usual number that graduated from the high school was 20. 
Five hundred and eighty-four went in at the bottom and 20 came out at the top. 
Barely 100 at the age of 12 to 15 have secured a common school education ; others 
haye fallen by the way, having attained a part only of what has been outlined above 
as clearly possible. It is an ‘unredeemed hardship to many children to remain in 
school unless the schools are doing the most and best for them. It isa crying injus- 
tice to waste the time of any child. 
" The question whether children as a result of instruction in schools read and desire 
to read was made the subject of particular inquiry. 
We find— 
(1) Many children of 12 can not read any ordinary book or paper intelligently. 
(2) In most schools they are not allowed to read more than a few paragraphs 
which are set for a reading lesson. 
(3) They are not encouraged and incited to read at home or in school upon sub- 
jects which they are studying or are interested in. 
(4) In very few cases they are direeted in their reading. The subjects which 
they study are presented to them only in text-books; this is true in geog- 
raphy and history. 
(5) As a result the children could not name any books which they had read, 
and inquiry did not elicit the fact that they had read many. 
(6) Few schools had libraries to whieh children had access, and in few towns 
were the public libraries open to children. 
This deplorable result is not due to inability of children, but to radically defective teach- 
ing. The methods of teaching can not secure the most and best education in a reasonable 
time. 
One book is prescribed for the reading of a year, and the class read this book over 
and over again and they read ne other. They can. recite this book fluently, and they 
eanread no other book fluently. Often when the book is opened, a picture or a word 
suggests the text, which can be recited as well without the book as withit. If any 
other book be opened to the child, he looks at it as a stranger and the teacher con- 
siders such a test an imposition and a reflection on her teaching. ‘The result, so sad 
and harmful, is that fora whole year the reading of the child has been narrowed and 
impoverished, and the delusion is that a child is learning to read. 
When we think how noble and admirable a thing real literature is, it is provoking 
to know that one book, sometimes containing rubbish, is, with the sanction of school 
officers, crammed into children as their only reading. 
Every known method of teaching reading is permitted, the good and the bad are 
open, and the choice is left to the untrained and inexperienced. Can it be wondered 
at that 135 of the teachers in New Haven County still dwell upon the letters in the 
yain belief that the naming of the letters is learning tqread? 
They teach as they were taught.

reading the books intelligently. 
Few teachers ever learn to teach penmanship; they lean wpon the copy book. These 
books pretend to be graded for different stages of progress. The children copy the 
letters at the top of ‘the page a few minutes each. day. The last line is often less 
correctly drawn than the first, because it is an inch or two farther removed from the 
copy. Yet to ask children to ‘write outside of the copy book is often called unfair. 
Can it be said that permitting the children to make the letters or words in one or 
even five writing books is teaching penmanship? Should a person who can not teach 
penmanship be given a certificate of qualification? The record shows that more than 
half of these teachers do not claim to be able to teach penmanship. 
Consider the instruction in arithmetic, the so-called “practical” branch. The best 
instruction in arithmetic does not regard addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division as four processes graduated from the lowest to the highest, and to be learned 
successively ; it assumes that the true progress is from small numbers to large, and 
from easy processes to more difficult ones. Hence, the beginner adds, subtracts, 
multiplies, and divides all the numbers in succession. He ascertains the parts of each 
number, including its fractional parts. He then applies the number to common 
things, like time, and measurements of every kind. He learns to perform different 
arithmetical processes and explains what is within the limit of numbers he has 
ained. 
F He proceeds in this way from one number to another. Large numbers and all 
extensive notation are reserved until later, or entirely discarded. ‘ By thus knowing 
simple and manageable numbers, and by infinitely varying the exercises upon them, 
he obtains a mastery of common and useful processes. He gains genuine prepara- 
tion for dealing with larger numbers if he ever needs them. He approaches prob- 
lems which are not obscured by large figures. The method is a workable and 
rational one. 
The papers of all children under 10 were rejected in making the summary, and the 
result of the test shows what children of 12 have learned in the public schools. In 
giving the oral questions, the children were allowed reasonable time and all reason- 
able helps. In the written work and problems they were allowed all the time they 
desired, 
It should’ be noted that these are the elementary, the very simplest processes, 
perfectly easy to children of 6 or 7,as can be readily shown. They ought to have 
been acquired in the first two years of school life.

Children whose failures are here recorded are taught to work the examples in the 
book, and to repeat the rules in the same book. There are cases where children can 
begin and repeat every rule without prompting. These rules are taught verbatim, 
and the children sedulously practiced in working examples. The real needs and 
capacities of young children are disregarded; business facility in the common opera- 
tions not thought of. Arithmetic has thus become a science of difficult trifles and 
intricate fooleries peculiar to common schools, and remarkable chiefly for sterility 
and ill-adaptedness for any useful purpose. It is pertinent to inquire, and parents 
ought to inquire, why children over 11 years of age can not correctly divide 546 by 3. 
The reason is that there has been no teaching whatever, or that the method of teaching is 
radically unsound. 
Il. Many teachers do not possess the necessary practical wisdom and professional skill. 
They do not know how to so arrange courses and to so instruct as to do the most possible of 
what is worth doing in a given time. 
An examination of our schools will seldom reyeal a teacher who is devoid of 
interest in her work. Many of them are young. Some of them are uneducated, 
while only a small per cent ever received anything like special training in the art 
of instruction. They are like lawyers who begin to practice when they begin to 
study, and like doctors who begin to give medicine when they first open their books. 
The analogy would be complete if physicians were appointed over limited districts 
and the children within these districts were obliged to take medicine and advice 
from them, or not at all. There should be no more thought of employing a public- 
school teacher who does not know how to give instruction than there is of employ- 
ing a musician whose musical education is limited to the hearing of a street band. 
Tho ends of education, therefore, demand that teachers be trained, and that if the State 
is to establish schools, it also expend some of its money in giving our teachers greater skill. 
Omitting one town, i. e., New Haven, in the county under review, it appears that 
35 of 203 teachers visited by the examiner had normal school or equivalent train- 
ing. Such training may mean much or little; the minimum would be a tolerable 
knowledge of the way to teach the common branches. 
Evidence is wanting that committees are strenuous in their efforts to secure teach- 
ers of approved character and qualifications. ‘There are many pernicious influences 
at work of which family and locality are the most conspicuous. No new blood can 
getin. The natural influx of trained teachers is prohibited, and the inefficient are 
protected. This is educational politics. The machinery and the output of this 
machinery are well known, and yet we do nothing about it but let the children 
suffer. Thus worked, the school system is not performing a great public duty, but 
perpetrating a great injustice.

  1642 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Often when an inadequate examination is passed and a certificate is secured by a 
teacher, professional equipment is regarded as complete. Of serious and systematic 
reading, of the pursuit of any branch of letters or of science for its own sake, or 
of the habit of self-instruction which alone can furnish the freshness of intellect 
needed by teachers, there is not much evidence. 
Those whose class work is observed and tested sometimes have some technical skill 
in the art of teaching, but there is absolute poverty of illustration and thought. 
This results from lack of reading and observation, by which light would be shed 
upon lessons and text-books. 
The recent development of primary education, so remarkable and widespread, 
has not touched many of these towns, and has not compelled an improvement in 
the qualifications of teachers. There are some men and women who have no con- 
ception of progress in education. They do not reject the idea; it has never been in 
their minds, ‘Their schcols are not only behind this age, but behind all ages. 
Nor is there in some towns much encouragement for teachers to secure by expend= 
iture of money and hard work substantial qualifications. The school officers have 
prescribed schemes of instructicn, founded on text-hooks, and exhibiting in minute 
detail the work to be done; no discretion either in plan or detail is left to the 
teacher. There is no’scope for her training, or knowledge, or individual experience. 
There is a limited and solidified programme; every subject and part of subject'is 
obligatory. The question for the teacher is, not what is useful, not what is best for 
this child or that, not what will do each the most good, but what is prescribed by 
the committee, school visitor, or superintendent. 
It follows that children are not expected to know anything outside of this limited 
routine, because it is not in the course of study, or has not been reached in the 
course of study; itis not in this grade; the page where it is found has not been 
turned over. That a subject is not prescribed, or has not been regularly reached, is 
an all-sufficient excuse for ignorance. For instance, in many, perhaps most, schools 
_fractions are not touched until children are 10 or 12 years old. In such schools if a 
quéstion involving a fraction is asked, it is then sufficient to say that the children 
have not had fractions. If the children should be asked to add a half and a quarter 
before they came to written addition of fractions in the book, they ought not to 
have heard of such an operation, They ought to keep silence if they have heard of it. 
An illustration is found in the fact that at least one-fourth of the children over 
114 did not work correctly the example, 546+3; they had not reached division. 
Children learn to add, and leaving school at 8 or 9 years of age, can not subtract nor 
use small fractions. 
‘The courses, of study, if any exist, are in reality constructed to conform to text- 
books, while the books themse are books of reference, sometimes good, sometimes 
bad, but not suitable to direct the method or even the order in which subjects should 
be presented. 
‘The same auherence to text-books is found where there is no course of study. The 
children will be required to give what the book contains, to perform the examples, 
say the rules, enumerate the mountains, and recite the battles in the order of the 
book. One teacher exhibited a boy as a meritorious scholar who had begun at the 
beginning of a United States history and repeated without verbal error 45 pages. 
Another boasted that his class could begin at the beginning of one of the larger 
arithmetics and give every rule and definition without prompting. Both of these 
teachers were men and adults. 
Jil. There is no adequate supervision. 
In 23 towns the schools are visited and supervisory duties performed twice in a 
term. 
There are in this county two large districts, New Haven and Waterbury, which 
employ a superintendent. 
Iti is quite impossible to characterize the ordinary visitation of schools as super- 
vision. It has no effect upon the teacher and is only intended to satisfy the visitor 
that in general the legal requirements of the school have been met. This is all he 
is obliged to testify to. It is-not essential to a legal school that any child or any 
class should have made any progress, or that a single child should have learned any- 
thing whatsoever. It is only necessary that the school should have been begun, 
continued, and ended in conformity to the statutes, which require no test of the 
quality of the education. 
This is a go-as-you-please system, which will make a good school if there happens 
to be a good teacher who is not hampered. The school system of the State does not, 
however, supply any assurance that the quality of the education will be good. On 
the contrary, we should naturally expect that it will sometimes be good and some- 
times bad, and that children will sometimes be educated and sometimes not. The 
only conditions absolutely essential are that the teacher shall be employed and the 
schoolhouse kept open. It is not even necessary that the studies preseribed by 
the State shall be taught. It is found that in many, perhaps most, schools writing,

  DISTRIOT OF COLUMBIA. 1643) 
which has been specifically prescribed, is not, in any proper sense, taught. The one 
result which is almost certain is that the children will not attend a good school 
continuously during their school lives. : 
The mischief which is here suggested has its seed in part in the law itself, which 
preseribes two visits a term as the legal requirement, and by implication expresses 
itself satisfied with that number. ‘These two visits can not amount to supervision, 
and if supervision be necessary, it ean not be had under such a law executed to the 
letter. School visitors can not be held responsible for the failure. 
The inefficiency in teaching noted above in some measure arises from the fact that 
the committees and visitors are entirely unacquainted with what should be taught 
in schools, and are not competent supervisors. Many of these teachers go astray in 
their work, because they have no one to tell them what they ought to do. Very 
frequently young persens labor hard but frnitlessly, because they have no notion of 
what they ought to accomplish. These teachers are thankful for suggestions, and 
no teacher has been found to reject recommendations or receive them otherwise 
than gratefully. Without question, the school eommittees and school visitors might 
inform themselves, and thus participate more frequently and actively in school 
work. This would be an impulse to the efforts of teachers, if it were well directed. 
IV. The high schools are dislocated from and do not lend a helpful hand to the elemen- 
tary schools. 
There is no eement by which the grammar schools are bound to the high schools. 
The high schools have dictated the studies of elementary schools to the endless harm 
of the latter. Schemes are formed, one school first grade, another second, another 
third, ete., but these names which represent a valuable reality when a school of 
lower grade gives an education useful in itself and thus fits for a higher, simply 
imply a harassing limitation upon the subjects of instruction when the higher 
school dictates the studies and directs the instruction in the lower, or when each 
school, instead of being a part of an organism, must act as an independent body. 
Possibly high schools are supplying as much education above the elementary as is 
demanded, but they are doing very little, perhaps nothing, to stimulate this demand. * 
In the larger towns the high schools furnish the instruction whieh a few wish for, 
but they do not help, or help only to a very slight extent, the main body of the 
youth in the town. 
This means that they are doing only what could be done without them. For when 
so few demand what the high schools afford, it is probable that the people who 
want this education for their children could be trusted to find it for them. These 
high schools provide at the expense of the taxpayer what a few want a little cheaper 
than private individuals could provide it. They should prove their right to exist 
by creating a demand for their special training and fitting youth for useful occu- 
pations. 
Notably is weak teaching manifest in the high schools apd in the advanced gram- 
mar grades in the elementary schools. Deficiencies in these grades are not easily 
detected. Children can be set to tasks useless or useful. Memory exercises indi- 
cating an apparent intellectual activity can be given, while the whole process of 
learning is fatal to thinking, and ultimately to independent right action. As in 
elementary schools, so in high schools the cardinal need to-day is a supply of persons 
qualified to intelligently instruct, * * *

Advantages of free text-books.—The distribution and preservation of text-books and 
supplies, though restricted to the first six grades of school, involved a large amount 
of extrawork and care, which, notwithstanding a custodian was employed, devolved 
largely on the supervising corps. This work added a large percentage to the labors 
of the supervisors, and at the same time correspondingly reduced the amount of 
work and attention that could be given to supervision and improving the teaching 
in the schools. Books and supplies to the value of $40,000 or $50,000, in use by 
40,000 children at work in a hundred schoolhouses distributed over 64 square miles 
of territory, required for their distribution, their preservation, and such constant 
knowledge of their condition as is desirable from a business as well as an ethical 
point of view not only much time as well as care, but also great labor and thought, 
demanding an expenditure of no inconsiderable nervous force. 
Free text-books and supplies, however, have been a great boon to thousands of 
children, and have secured the prompt and regular attendance at school of many
-P-A-G-E-426
  1644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
who, if they had been obliged to buy their books, could not have attended at all. 
They have also served to make the schools more eflicient_and more uniform in their 
efficiency than schools can be made whose pupils furnish their own books, because 
uniformity in the character of supplies and promptness in furnishing them are more 
easily secured when books and supplies are provided by the school authorities than 
when they are furnished by the pupils. With few exceptions, resulting from ina- 
bility of contractors to fill our orders promptly, teachers had to do but little waiting 
for materials with which to work during the year. The advantage of this is con- 
siderable, being especially appreciable in the poorer districts of the city and the 
more distant county schools. No other purely administrative item has tended so 
much to unify the teaching of our schools and to make it as good in the less-favored 
localities as it is elsewhere as this uniformity of supplies and this promptness in 
getting them into the hands of the teacher. 
Except in a few cases the books have been well preserved and the supplies care- 
fully and economically used. ‘The supervisors have exercised a judicious, intelli- 
gent, and painstaking supervision in the use and preservation of everything that 
has passed through their hands. The teachers, as a rule, have shown that interest 
and exercised that care in the preservation of books and the economical use of sup- 
plies that they would be expected to show were they providing these things them- 
selves. In many instances the teachers do more than this; they impress upon their 
pupils the moral importance in caring for property that is a loan or trust or whose 
use is in part a gift. Indeed the strongest teachers have made this an opportunity 
to impress upon the minds of the children the moral obligation that rests upon one 
who is the custodian of public property, making them feel not alone that their 
own interests in the ownership of what they use should insure a careful considera- 
tion for its welfare, but also that the fact that they are trusted agents is a much 
weightier reason why they should be careful of this property. If the coming gen- 
eration of citizens can be trained to a feeling of responsibility in the exercise of care 
in the use of public property which shall result in the cessation of vandalism, care- 
less destruction, and the hoidenish practice of writing their names and carving 
their initials in public places, thus marring the beauty of everything they touch, 
the furnishing of free text-books will yield a fruitage quite commensurate with the 
ent 
One may almost know before an examination of a school has been made the con- 
dition of the books in use and the care that is exercised in the preservation of 
perishable materials, as paper, ink, and pencils, by the condition of the fence inclos- 
ing the school lot and the fences of the adjoining lots, by the condition of the halls 
and other passageways of the school building, and he will be further strengthened 
in such judgment by the presence or absence of cuts, mars, and marks on theschool 
furniture, on entering the schoolroom. These are telltales whose reliable stories the 
wise supervisor will not fail to readin passing. It has been the constant effort of 
the supervising corps to train the children to preserve the property of the District, 
not so much for the preservation, per se, though that is strong enough reason for the 
effort, but that the training of the children may be secured to that manly conduct, to 
tbat conscientious discharge of duty in the use of property that characterizes the 
safe man. 
Moral effect of the condition of schoolhouses.—The condition of the houses and their 
surroundings at all times should be such as to influence the children to thoughtful 
care in their treatment of them. To the effects of this condition is due much that 
gives character to the conduct of the children. A scratch on the casing of door or 
window invites another scratch. A boy sees less harm in breaking a pane of glass 
adjacent to another that is broken than he does in breaking one in a sash containing 
only whole panes. It doesnot seem very wrong to jerk or twist from its post a gate 
that is hanging by only one hinge. To the mind of the child it is a small matter to 
take one or more bricks from a sidewalk already broken or partly torn up. The 
lesson to be learned from these facts by the management, if the children are to 
receive proper influence from their surroundings, is that the schoolhouses and their 
appurtenances should be kept in perfect repair all the time. The effect of a clean 
schoolroom, in good repair, on a pupil’s life and conduct is greater than any code of 
precept on order and cleanliness that may be dictated by the teacher or other person 
in authority. The one becomes a part of himself, because he lives it; the other he is 
likely not to believe, if he understands it, because it has only been said to him. 
People are what they grow to be. They grow on what they take for nourishment. 
The life of a young childis undoubtedly affected by what is said to him, but it is 
influenced far more by what he does. The atmosphere of a well-ordered, well-kept 
schoolroom is not only an inspiration, but it is moral nourishment developing his 
tender life in desirable, profitable growths. It is a crime to the State and to the 
individual child, to the State because to the individual child, to permit him to sit
-P-A-G-E-427
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 1645 
for a school term on a broken chair, at a desk whose top is scratched and marred, in 
aschoolroom that is dirty and otherwise untidy. How different must be the effect 
on a child of daily work for an entire year on a comfortable seat, at a desk that is 
in good repair, in a clean, well-ordered schoolroom, with books that are whole and 
free from dirt, from a corresponding daily work on a stool without a back, at a desk 
made hideous by the vandal’s knife or inconvenient and ugly by accident or care- 
lessness, in a dirty, untidy schoolroom, with torn and dirty books? Example is a 
contagion for which there is no antidote. 
  Night schools.—Stable character of membership.—Teachers.—The night schools, as 
they grow older and become more mature, show their usefulness and thus prove their 
right to exist and the importance of giving to them liberal support. Their history, 
which points clearly to a fluctuation of attendance and a variation in their success, 
proves the importance of giving to them a wise and careful supervision. Pupils 
present themselves for instruction in successive years at those schools that are well 
taught and skillfully managed. The system of gradation that was adopted at the 
beginning of the school seems to work well for the adjustment of the teaching force 
as well as for the educational interest of those who attend them. Much latitude is 
allowed in the interpretation of this course for the different schools. Promotions 
have taken place from year to year, so that now pupils are advanced from the divi- 
sion night schools to the night high school. This gradation of work and the conse- 
quent promotion of pupils who finish the work of a given grade seem to influence 
the pupils to a continued effort for a longer time than one or two years. At least 
334 per cent show this continuity of purpose. The increase of this element in the 
annual enrollment is an evidence of the substantial results the night schools are 
securing. A spasm of desire for improvement that lasts but a half dozen evenings 
is perhaps to be encouraged, but is not encouraging, while a purpose to learn and 
improve that shows staying qualities which last a term of years under varying cir- 
cumstances gives encouraging promise that assistance given to it will fructify in 
ood. 
The stable character of the membership is shown by the fact that in the early 
history of these schools there were few pupils in the upper or highest classes while 
the lowest were crowded, whereas now the highest classes are large while the lowest 
classes are small, It is perhaps advisable for the board of trustees to offer to such 
as finish a course at the night high school a certificate of graduation. This would 
serve as an incentive to many to attend more regularly and for a longer time, yet it 
could be done easily and at little cost. It would add dignity to the whole system 
of night schools and would have a strong tendency to insure their stability, as very 
many of those who attend them require some incentive to continued effort in well- 
doing stronger than a love for knowledge, and as the irregular attendance in these 
schools gives little opportunity for developing the spirit of the true student. 
Experience has shown that only those teachers who succeed well in day-school 
work are fitted to do even passable work in the night schools. It is a difficult mat- 
ter to secure enough competent teachers from the day-school force, as the day-school 
work is very exacting and consequently exhausting. Only the strongest (phys- 
ically) can teach both day and night school. Many persons seeking employment 
regard the night school as a place to experiment orto “try their hand” at teaching. 
Wherever such experimenting has been allowed the teaching has proved a failure. 
The pupils in every instance have been able to detect the lack of ability andstrength 
in the teacher. ‘‘As the teacher so the school” proves especially true of night 
schools. A person unaccustomed to manage others in large numbers is helpless in 
the presence of a dozen or score of boys and young men, much of whose life is spent 
on the street. It were better not to have night schools than to put them in the 
hands of such persons. 
It is especially noteworthy that those night schools are the most successful whose 
principals have remained at their heads for a number of years. Principals who 
remain at the work from year to year become interested in it, get to know thor- 
oughly the conditions of the pupils as well as their ambitions, and are thus able to 
plan for them better than strangers can. The pupils become acquainted with the 
principal, learn his ways, and if they are satisfied to stay at school at all, develop 
a pride for the one they attend. This mutual interest between principal and pupils 
is an important factor in securing good results, but being of slow growth is rarely 
found in schools whose principals are changed each year. The night-school princi- 
palship is an important position, one which can not be well filled except by a person 
of broad experience. It is a position demanding executive ability, liberal educa- 
tion, and experience in its practical application, and especially a missionary spirit. 
A person to fill this position well should feel the responsibility that attaches to it 
sufficiently to be willing to make sacrifices for his pupils whose antecedents and 
present lives he must study, A few persons have been found who have made the   
   
-P-A-G-E-428
1646 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  position what it ought tobe. The place isnot asinecure. It may be desirable to 
increase the principal’s pay, that when the right persons have been found they may 
more easily be induced to stay. 
Kindergartens.—There can be no doubt that a relatively small annual expenditure 
for kindergartens would give rich returns to the school and to the community. It 
is not difficult for the teachers of experience to select from the children entering the 
first grades thoso who have had training in the kindergarten. They learnenough more 
rapidly and enough more thoroughly to warrant the maintenance of this kind of 
school for its economic value alone, This is more evident when it is considered that 
the child who does not get training in the kindergarten before coming to the primary 
school gets, in too many instances, a training that is a hindrance to progress until 
it has been corrected. 
Much of evil found in many persons that lasts, and whose fruitage is measured in 
the police court, is implanted in early life at the kindergarten age. It weald be 
in the interest of good government and of economy to get hold of these persons and 
properly care for them before germs of evil are planted in their susceptible young 
lives, which, when strength of character develops, make criminals of them. No 
small part of the effort of the primary teachers is given to counteracting the teach- 
ing that has been done by the street the year or two preceding the fime the child 
enters the school. An earlier start at this by one year or more would be an inesti- 
mable advantage. The kindergarten offers this. 
Gradation and promotion of pupils.—The gradation and promotion of ehildten are 
two subjects requiring the utmost care and the most profound consideration of those 
who manage school systems. It is detrimental to a pupil’s interests for him to be 
improperly graded for any great length of time. The effect of having to work in 
too high a de may be as harmful as having to work in a grade that is too 1 
thongh of quite a different character. The graded school scheme may work inj 
to the child if the course of instruction is inflexibly fixed by metes and bounds of 
text-books, as indicated by page, chapter, section, or paragraph. A graded course 
of instruction so outlined or determined, in the hands of a machine teacher or an 
inexperienced teacher not under close and correct professienal guidance, will do the 
child harm from which he may never recover. Tho value of graded instruction, 
that is, teaching many pupils the same lesson at the same time, as compared with 
that of individual instruction, is receiving the attention of many earnest thinkers 
among those who are inv gating the effects of our social institutions. The evil 
to which I have alluded has been pointed out by many of these inquirers, some of 
whom have sought a remedy for it. 
Among the various plans that have been offered as remedies is that of shortening 
the period of the grade; that is, making a grade a half year or a quarter of a year 
long and allowing talented or competent pupils to pass along rapidly, but detaining 
for a longer time those who are unable to do the work—a plan of gradation and 
promotion now in vogue in some of the cities of the United States. The effect of this 
is, of course, to advance the talented pupil along the straight line of the course 
more rapidly than he would be advanced were the grades each a year in length, 
requiring him to do more waiting for the less fortunate pupil to accomplish pre- 
scribed work. The effect of the plan must be to foster and emphasize in the mind of 
the teacher that view or understanding of the graded course of work from which 
the greater portion of the poor grade teaching proceeds, namely, that the course of 
study contains, in its letter, all that any need learn, and only that which all must 
learn. This is the root of the evils of graded work, as opposed to individual work. 
The evils of the plan for prevention may become more serious than the one which 
it is intended to prevent. These evils are threefold: 
First, the tendency of rapid promotion is to prevent, in the interest of “ going up” 
more rapidly within prescribed lines, a breadth of learning for which some ehildren 
who are sent up in advance of their mates are capable, and to minimize the broaden- 
ing which allshould get before they are allowed to advanee. This broader learning 
involves (a) the assuring or confirming part of perception and conception that is 
secured by testimony, testimony of numerous examples or of authority, or both, and 
(b) the synthetic steps of menfal acts, rounding them ont, perfecting or complet- 
ing them, and applying them, as oppesed to the purely analytic steps of mental acts, 
a most necessary part of education indeed. 
Second, rapid promotion results in taking the ehild while he is yet young and 
immature, as graded courses of study are now planned, to higher work, work suited 
only to maturer minds, minds that have proved their seuse impressions and synthe- 
sized their powers and their percepts. If the advanced grades of instruction were 
simply for giving broader views and more numerous applications of principles 
learned in the grades below them, and for formulating such views and applications, 
rapid advancement along the straight line of the course would be conducive to 
healthy mind growth; it would be strength giving in its tendency, and would 
secure to the pupil that possession of confidence in himself which is a result of all 
        
     
-P-A-G-E-429
KENTUCKY. 1647 
  correct learning. Butsuch isnottheease. The child, in passing from grade to grade, 
encounters at each step anew subject or a new part of asubject thatis to him a 
new subject, which must be approached by analysis. Concepts come enly by syn- 
thesis, but the child thus rapidly moved from one thing toanother of greater difficulty 
is accumulating unrelated percepts. Because of this, he is given little opportunity 
te complete his mental acts and make totals of them, resulting to hin on the culture 
side in unorganized, unrelated bits of strength, and on the acquistion side “patch- 
work ” knowledge, whose relations he has never been: made to see fully and of whose 
uses he is: in the main ignorant. ‘Fhe pupil whe is advameed rapidly from grade to 
grade often meets with subjects that are too intricate for him: to understand, and   
    
  which he consequently learns ouly in an unprofitable, memoriter way. If didactic — 
teaching is not done and memoriter learning not allowed he may yet be hurried 
from one point to another before his mind has had testimony enough to shape or 
give character to a sense impression and n x percept of it, and exercise giving it 
strength enough to hold the percept in sciousness a8 a permanent acquisition. 
Then, too, it must be remembered sense impressions are not percepts, nor does it 
make percepts of them for the teacher to name them for the child and eanse him to 
commit the names to memory. What must be the influence of this kind of train- 
ing (?) on the mind of the boy, continued fora greater part of the time devoted to 
elementary and secondary education? It is not strange that pupils thus taught dis- 
appoint their friends and employers when tested in practical life. It is not strange, 
perhaps, though it ought to be, that a pupil thus taught can get into college, and 
whils there be one of the bright lights of his class, and graduate from it an “honor 
man.” 
Third, rapidly hurrying part of the class over a course of study does great injustice 
in many instances to those whio are left behind. The totality of the mind of one boy 
may be as great or even greater than that ef another, yet the former may appear to 
the unskilled teacher much duller and Jess talented than the latter, because he gets 
percepts less easily, whicl: power only is considered by the teacher im rating the two 
boys. But the slowness with which he gets percepts is not proof that he is less 
talented than the other. His mind may require more testimony before a percept 
becomes, and yet when it is fixed he may have natural aptness im synthesizing or 
ying percepts, or both, of whicu his apparently more fortunate mate may have 
little. The one boy is only apparently “bright” and the other is only apparently 
“dull,” and that to a teacher incompetent to judge of mind aggregations. The kind 
of teaching that rapid promotion almost inevitably induces prevents the teacher 
from striking a balance and knowing the working value of a child’s mind. Ina 
majority of cases it gives no opportunity to test the minds of the class, ay simple 
justice demands they should be tested before the scrions distinctions are made that 
are shown by the promotion of some and the detention of others. The stronger 
person, as shown by an aggregate of mental endowments, is often found at the foot 
of the class, and is therefore left behind when promotions are made.    
      
      
  KENTUCKY. 
[From the report of State Supt. Ed. Porter Lhompson for 1892-93. 
Some leading facts.—There are at present in Kentucky between 8,000 and 9,000 public schools, under the supervision of city and county superintendents. 
The teachers employed in these schools number approximately 9,400. The number 
of white teachers in the counties receiving first-class eerti for the year ended 
June 30, 1893, was approximately 43 per cent, as compared with 23 per cent for that 
ended June 30, 1891, and this notwithstanding the fact that the examinations have 
been gradually growing more difficult. 
‘The average annual State fund disbursed in cities and eounties for the two years 
ended June 30, 1891, was $1,275,181.78; contributed by local taxation for all pur- 
poses, $723,2: The average annual State fand for the two years ended June 30, 
1893, was: $1,668,308.37; contributed by local taxation for all purposes, approxi- 
mately, $834,115.33. This remarkable inerease of State fund, more than 30 per cent, 
was due in part to the fact that in 1892 the direct tax due to Kentueky by the Gen- 
eral Government, $606,641.03, was returned, and by constitutional provision was 
made part ef the school fund, and on which a semiannual interest of 6 per cent is 
paid yearly; in part to the fact that the new revenue law has materially increased 
the State’s finances. It is to be remarked as a most favorable indication that the 
increase of local aid during the two years was mere than £5 per cent. - 
Character of the system.—Apparently much, indeed most, of what the active friends 
of popular education have been contending for as to organization and State aid has 
been secured. The system is so comprehensive and symmetrical as to present the 
appearance of having that close organic connection of schools of all grades, from that 
of the ordinary district to the State college, for which the Swiss plan is so much

commended, Harmonious working,is assured, and so liberal are its provisions that 
it not only places within the reath of every child a common school education, but 
contemplates graded free schools in every county, which shall afford to all within 
their districts higher and more thorough training, and give to those in districts not 
so favored this opportunity at the smallest reasonable cost—schools supplying the 
place of what has been much insisted on, a central high school for certain prescribed 
territory. In the cities excellent organizations are established and maintained—in 
part by the State, in part by municipal tax—that give adequate instruction, gen- 
erally for ten months in the year, through all the grades from kindergarten begin- 
ning to preparation for college. 
SOME OF THE CONDITIONS UNDER THE NEW SCHOOL LAW. 
  I. Uniform term provided for.—Of the new conditions already established and in 
process of establishment may be mentioned that which insures to every district a 
five-months school. It puts away the injustice wkich has long been perpetrated 
upon thousands of children in the State—the curtailing of their school term one and 
two months because they were unfortunately residents of small districts. 
IL. Grading the schools.—Another, and one that will eventuate in benefits hardly 
to be estimated, is that mandatory provision of the act of July 6, 1893, requiring the 
grading of all the public schools. The State board of education, anticipating this, 
had formulated a systematic course of study, with suggestive daily programme of 
study and recitation, and a one-year register corresponding, to supply temporarily 
the place of the four-year grade book now required by law. With the opening of the 
schools for the year 1893-94, some thousands of teachers evinced their intelligence 
by reducing to practice the plan outlined. The schools have thus, at this writing, 
begun their transformation fromaspecies of chaos to order; from haphazard tosystem; 
from the reign of whim (that made a hobby of grammar or arithmetic or geography, 
and consigned to almost utter neglect the other branches) to methodical attention to 
every subject and consequent symmetrical training. 
IIL. County teachers’ association.—The new school law makes this association a dis- 
tinct part of the county organization, with obligations of meeting, discussions, etc. 
IV. Teachers’ libraries.—The new law also provides that each county shall have a 
teachers’ library. Under a system where it is the exception and not the rule forthe 
county schools to be supplied with trained teachers, this is especially important. 
V. Kindergarten work and manual training.—A most significant indication is the 
ever-increasing attention paid to kindergarten and manual training work. In the 
cities these features are being introduced into the public schools, equipment provided, 
and very admirable work done. It is, of course, impracticable to introduce these 
distinctive features into the common district schools where the teaching force is 
limited, as a rule, to one person; but in most city schools, and in those graded free 
schools provided for in sections 100 to 130, school law, the plan is feasible. 
Legal provisions relating to teachers.—Recent legal enactments, tending to improve 
teachers in their profession, may be noted as follows: 
1. The payment of teachers according to grade of certificate. 
2. The limiting of third-class certificates to a single issue. 
3. The requirement that all schools shall be graded. 
4. The increasing difficulty in the way of obtaining @ certificates. The law is 
exacting, and county boards are growing more and more , disposed to rule firmly and 
justly. 
5. The prohibiting of the more immature from obtaining certificates. 
6. The county library and the reading circle. 
7. The county teachers’ association. 
8. The issuing of State certificates and State diplomas—difficult to obtain, but 
good for long terms. 
9. The effort to reduce institute work to uniformity and give definiteness of aim 
to all instructors. 
10. The requirement that teachers shall so demean themselves, and interest them- 
selves in their respective districts, as to win the good will and confidence of patrons, 
and thus insure at least a reasonable attendance of pupils. 
11. Better wages. 
Training schools.—The State does have one for the whites, and it is doing a great 
work. The normal department of the State college—to and from which transporta- 
tion is free, where tuition is free, the facilities excellent, the teaching force sound 
and strong—had during 1892-93 a large number of matriculates. This is well, but 
it is not sufficient. Many of our young people, whether necessarily or not, go to 
the training schools of other States. 
The State normal school for colored persons is devoted in part to the training of 
teachers for the schools of that people, and has an attendance that, measured by 
the relative populations, exceeds that of the white training school at Lexington. 
The faculty having in charge its various departments will compare favorably with

any body of colored teachers in the Union; and this single institution, if somewhat 
enlarged and improved as to its facilities, would adequately supplement the work 
now being done by mission and other schools in supplying the State with well 
educated and trained colored teachers, 
The Louisville system comprehends a splendid training school for her own teachers, 
well manned, well appointed, and fruitful of results.

State text-books.—On June 10, 1893, the State board adopted, for the ensuing four 
years, a uniform list of school text-books, and contracts were mado with tho several 
publishing houses for furnishing the same to patrons of the public schools at advanta- 
geous prices. Later on in the year supplemental books for general reading and for 
high school grades were added to the regular list, with a view cf giving an option 
in choice to localities where great expense had been incurred in the purchase of 
books under former contracts. The general policy of the board was not to change 
books hitherto in use save in cases where exceptional advantages as to price and 
quality of books wero offered by publishers. 
High schools established:—A board of trustees appointed by the State board of 
education have crected at Opelousas a commodious and well-furnished building for 
a central high school. This school has some revenue from its own property, and 
also receives assistance from local corporations. Tho State board also has author- 
ized the school board of the parish of St. Mary to establish a high school at Franklin. 
Educational societics.—As one of the indications of awakening public sentiment in 
regard to educational matters within the past few years, it will not be amiss to refer 
to the origin and continuance of numerous societies or associations which have in 
view the dissemination of learning or the institution of scientific research, In many 
instances these societies have lecture and practical departments with their regular 
work, and their chief aim is educational. Combining in their membership all grades - 
of ability, they include the skilled and amateurs alike, These associations or unions 
are unquestionably a means of valuable instruction in technical knowledge. 
The city of New Orleans may be said to contain as many societies for the dissemi- 
nation of technical knowledge or the cultivation of esthetic tastes as perhaps any 
city in the nation. 
In an age when all professions and trades are organized into associations and 
guilds, the teachers have not been idle; the public school teachers of this State 
have now a State organization whose entire purposes are comprehended in their 
avowed objects to elevate the profession of teaching and to promote the school 
interests of the State. 
Local taxration.—The State superintendent recommends that a constitutional 
amendment be submitted to the people “ by which local corporations shall be com- 
pelled to levy the school tax mentioned in article 209 of the constitution. It is 
earnestly hoped that this needful amendment will be made, and that all restrictions 
on local taxes will be so far removed as will enable the people to levy requisite 
taxes for the support of the schools.” 
The poll tax.—The revenue received from poll tax continues to increase each year, 
but the collections are not as complete as the school officers desire. Officers in charge. 
of the collections are generally active in their endeavors to collect the tax, but the 
Jaw does not afford sufficient opportunity for compulsory taxation, If some means 
by which each adult male would surely pay his poll tax could be devised, the 
amount accruing to the school treasury would be considerable, and would bring 
about the further improvement and enlargement of the school system. Many 
citizens have advocate that the payment of this tax be made a quaiification for 
suffrage. This plan seems generally preferred and advocated, and I am heartily in 
favor of it. One of the many points urged in its favor is that its enforcement will 
tend to interest all classes in schools, thereby inducing them to patronize an insti- 
tution which they help to support. 2 
The State normal school.—In the improvement of our school system that has taken 
place during the last few years, one of the most powerful factors has been the State 
normal school at Natchitoches. The establishment of this institution by legislative 
act of 1884 was the beginning of a new era in our educational development. 
The graduates whom it sends forth annually in increasing numbers are carrying 
their ideas of improved methods of teaching into the remotest corners of the State. 
And it is a significant fact that the most rapid improvement in public schools has 
taken place in those localities in which normal graduates have been employed in 
greatest numbers. To these valuable results of the training afforded by the State 
normal school should be added the incalculable benefit that our teachers and our 
people generally have derived from the teachers’ institutes held throughout the 
ED 93——104

cipline, of inspiring them with a higher conception of the dignity of their calling, and of convincing the people that the public schools are worthy of their constant 
care and their hearty support. 
The report of the president of the State normal school shows a gratifying increaso 
in its patronage. In fact this institution has outgrownits present cramped quarters.

HIGH SCHOOLS, 
  The inerease from year to year in these means for secondary instruction indicates 
an abiding interest rather than any sudden impulse in favor of high schools, while an 
imerease of seven in a single year shows how deep rooted the interest is. With 
the exception of the city of Worcester, all the schools added to the list this year are 
in towns of rural populations, nonce of them having the number of inhabitants or the 
number of families requiring them to maintain high schools. It is not to be pre- 
sumed that all these schools have extended courses such as the first-class city high 
schools afford. They provide some of the studies of the secondary schools, and so in 
ameasure meet the desire for a more liberal culture than country grammar schools 
can furnish. 
The number of persons enrolled in the high schools was 28,582, an increase of 1,100 
over theenrol]ment of last year. ‘Though in keeping with the inerease in the number 
of schools, the increase in membership is in the numbers attending the schools as a 
whole and not due alone to the new schools established. 
The ratio of the membership of the high schools is, for the whole State, 7.2 per cent 
of the membership in all the public schools. The ratio has advanced in ten years 
from 5.8 per cent to 7.2 per cent. Ina few towns over 10 per cent of all the pupils 
are in the- high schools. A much larger per cent enters them and takes a partial 
course. In some towns as high a rate as 40 per cent enters these schools, and as the 
course of studies expands, students in larger numbers are attracted to them. 
The number of towns required to keep high schools is 164; thenumber that do keep 
them is 228. Thus secondary instruction at public expense is provided by 64 towns 
that are not required by law to furnish it. The entire population of the 228 towns 
is 2,113,286; of the entire State the population is 2,238,943. The proportion of this 
population provided with high schools in their own towns is 94.4 per cent. Towns 
like Revere, which pay the tuition of their high school pupils to ethertowns, being 
included with the above, the percentage would reach 95 per cent. If there beadded 
to the above public provision that made for secondary instruction by individual 
citizens, it may be assumed that practically this form of instruction is available for 
all the children, without the necessity of very serious sacrifice on their part or on tho 
part of their parents. That all the children included in the population do not 
receive its benefits is not on account of unwillingness to make for it ample provision. 
There is in most high schools a larger number of girls than of boys; in some 
schools it is as four to one, This fact deserves serious consideration by parents and 
school authorities. 
TEACHERS’ WAGES. 
The whole number of different teachers employed in the public schools during the 
year 1892-93 was 11,233, of which 989 were males, 10,244 females. The average wages 
of the male teachers were $140.73 per month, which is an inerease for the year of $6.51. 
The average wages of the female teachers were $48.13 per month, which is an increase 
for the year of $1.61 per month. 
The average wages paid women for teaching are not in advance of those paid in 
other less responsible occupations open to women, and when compared with the 
wages paid male teachers they are so low as to make it humiliating to report the two 
in connection. Moreover, the advance in the wages of male teachers in ten years has 
been at the rate of 36.2 per cent, while that for female teachers has been at the rate 
of 14.8 per cent. 
So long as the present low wages are paid to the mass of female teachers, the tend- 
ency will be for superior young women to seek employment in other occupations, 
especially if places can be secured in them without long preliminary training, and 
give promise of greater permanence and less strain upoa the nervous system. If it 
be said, there are always more applicants than places for teaching, the reply is, yes, 
and the more nearly the work of the teacher approaches a menial service, or receives 
amenial’s pay, the greater will be the number of applicants.
-P-A-G-E-433
    
MASSACHUSETTS. 1651 
It is somewhat encouraging to see the advance in the wages of male teachers, Not 
so encouraging is it to witness the decline, which has been pretty constant for the 
last ten years, in the number of male teachersemployed. There is some slight relief 
from the solicitude occasioned by the steady falling off of male teachers in the fact 
that it is more than compensated for in the number of male teachers transferred to 
the ranks of school superintendents. We believe it to be for the advantage of the 
youth of both sexes to be brought under the influence of male as well as of female 
teachers. The best private schools exhibit greater wisdom than the public schools 
in the greater number of male teachers they employ.

   Tho average cost per pupil for text-books and supplies since the enactment of the 
free text-book law, now nine years, has been at the rate of $1.63 a year; since the 
first two years there has been a slight annual increase ;.the cost for the present year 
is $1.75. The total sum paid is $562,228, which is an inerease, as previously stated, 
of $35,064.40 for the year. ) 
There is general satisfaction with the operation of the free text-book law, though 
the desiro has been expressed quite emphatically, and the claim has been persist- 
ently urged in somo localities, that the children should be allowed to take with, 
them, on permanently leaving school, the books they last used. This would some- 
what increase the expense for supplies, but it would have the advantage of fur- 
nishing some books which might serve for occasional reference in homes which 
otherwise would have none, and it would secure to the schools a more frequent 
fresh supply.

    The law authorizing towns to appropriate money for the conveyance of children 
to school has been upon the statute book since 1869, and yet the towns did not for 
several years avail themselves of its privileges. One direct advantage of the lawis 
the facility it gives the towns for consolidating their schools. In recent years this 
has been going on in all parts of the State, and within the past three years ata 
greatly increased rate. The sum expended during the past year was $50,590.41, an 
increase of $11,864.34, or ef 30.6 per cent as compared with the previous year. The 
plan of consolidation where conveyance is provided proves most advantageous, and 
seems in practice to be attended with no unfayorable conditions. 
  SUPERVISION BY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Since the year 1854 provision has been made by which towns can legally avail 
themselves of the service of school superintendents to supplement the supervision 
earlier provided for by town school committees. Until the law of 1888 the superin- 
tendent form of supervision was limited to the populous and wealthy towns and 
cities. The enactment of that year, with the amendments of last year, makes it pos- 
sible for every town in the State to employ a superintendent of schools. It provides 
that towns not exceeding two and one-half millions of valuation mav unite in groups 
 
-P-A-G-E-434
  1652 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
for this purpose; it limits cach group to a maximum of fifty and a minimum of 
twenty-five schools. It requires that each group of towns shall pay for the support 
of asuperintendent $750 a year. ‘To aid the towns the law provides for the payment 
to every such group the sum of $1,250 from the State treasury, $750 of which shall 
go to supplement tho sum paid the superintendent by the towns, so that his salary 
shall be at least $1,500, and the remaining $500 shall be paid for teachers’ salaries. 
Both sums are intended, cither directly or indirectly, to improve the work of 
teaching. 
No recent enactment affecting the schools has met with more general and hearty 
approval than the act of 1888. 
Out of 352 towns in the State, 221 are employing superintendents. The number 
employing them under the original law and under that of 1570, which differs from 
itin no essential particular, is 105; the number employing them under the recent 
enactment is 109. The former class of towns includes nearly every town in the State 
of considerable population and of high valuation; the latter class embraces the 
small, sparsely populated, and poorer towns of the State. 
Included in these two classes of towns, the number of schools under this form of 
supervision is 6,235, ont of a total number of public schools in the State of 7,510, or 
83 per cent of the whole number. The number of school children under super- 
intendents is 347,804, out of a total in the public schools of 391,745, which is 88.7 per 
per cent against 85.8 per cent for the previous year. 
There are still 131 towns, or 37 per cent of the whole number of towns in the 
State, not employing superintendents. The per cent of last year was 40.3 per cent. 
The greater part of these towns are small and relatively poor. Many of them have 
voted to accept the provisions of the act of 1888, but find no towns with which they 
can conveniently unite. ‘The isolated condition of many towns makes it difficult 
to combine them with others to advantage. The difficulty of effecting unions for 
this class of towns increases as the towns first to avail themselves of the provisions 
of the law become more accustomed to working together. 
There are still towns that do not exhibit an active interest in securing for their 
schools the benefits of skilled supervision. There is no known opposition to the 
principle upon which the employment of a special agent to superintend the schools 
is based; indeed, it seems to meet with universal acceptance. A large number of 
towns desirous of securing for their schools this form of supervision are unable to 
do so for reasons already stated. I advise, therefore, that authority be given the 
proper persons to make such combinations of towns as shall provide for bringing 
every school under the superintendent form of supervision. 
A provision could at least be made for aiding towns of less than two and a half 
millions of valuation to unite with towns exceeding this valuation and employing 
superintendents. There are employed under the earlier laws superintendents who 
could give part of their time to superintending the schools of one or more additional 
towns. An amendment to the law of 1888, giving proportionate aid to such towns 
as wi uld come properly under this law to enable them to obtain such superintendent 
service, would in some instances afford the needed relief. 
It is certain that so important 2 means of supervising the schools as a good super- 
intendent is admitted to be should be brought to bear upon every school and every 
child, even the humblest in the State.

Educational councils and rallies.—The superintendent of public instruction early 
realized the necessity of harmonious work with the board of examiners and county 
school commissioners. Ilo also realized the importance of acquainting himself with 
the school work in every portion of the State, and of learning the sentiment and 
peculiar conditions existing in different counties. 
With this in view the State was divided into twenty-one districts, and a convenient 
place of meeting suggested for each district. 
The “council” was in all cases called to meet Friday, and to this meeting were 
invited all the examiners and commissioners of the district, the school officers, and 
superintendents of schools... Teachers and others were welcome, and many attended. 
These councils were entirely informal. Any question could be brought up. No 
formal speeches were made. Everyone could air his views as freely as he pleased. 
To show the nature of the councils we give herewith tho list of topics suggested for 
discussion in the notices sent out from the department: 
Amendments to the school law. 
Methods of conducting examinations, marking papers, and giving results. 
Should the country schools be graded? 
Relation of district to city schools.

The use and abuse of examinations. 
District libraries, 
These ‘councils ” haye proved very helpful indeed to the State superintendent in 
making him conversant with public sentiment concerning school matters as viewed 
by all the factors that are active in the administration of school affairs. At every 
council there were representatives from school boards, patrons, teachers, examiners, 
and commissioners. 
Free tect-books,—The system of free text-books which provides for the ownership of 
the books by the district and loaning them to pupils has been tried by some of our 
cities and a few of ourrural districts forseveral years. In journeying about the State 
we have taken especial pains to inquire how satisfactory the system proves to be, 
and almost without exception it is most unanimously commended by both eity and 
country districts. The cities of the State which have adopted the system are De- 
troit, Grand Rapids, Saginaw East Side, and Bay City. Of these cities East Saginaw 
has tried the system for the past nine years. None but laudatory reports come from 
officers and teachers concerning the workings of the plan. We give herewith a 
table showing the average cost per capita for text-books during the past nine years 
in Saginaw East Side: 
| wines ool. . V iitebe bin ected for Actual Number | Cost per 
Total cost. [ae to| 34 cout: 27 laf qe abelstl aeoee ts books. 
  This should encourage other cities and villages to try the experiment. The rural 
teachers and school otiicers of the districts where the plan has been tried say that 
the books are kept better than when owned by the individuals, the cost is reduced, 
uniformity secured, and time saved, because pupils are always provided with books 
on the first day of the term instead of being obliged to “ wait until pa goes to town,” 
till he forgets to get the books onco or twice, and then buys the wrong book. The 
expense upon the whole district is insignificant, and the advantages are so apparent 
that it would seem advisable for every district to adopt the plan. ‘The districts now 
working under the system are mostly in the northern part of the State. 
Libraries.—The most important factor in a good school, next to the teacher, is a 
good school library. If my child could have but one, either a college education or 
a taste for good literature with ability to read it, I would without hesitation choose 
the latter. Fortunately we are not obliged to make this choice, A taste for good 
reading, and a generous education are both within the reach of every child in Michi- 
gan. In many of our cities by means of the philanthropic gifts of wealthy men, or 
the far-sighted acts of school authorities, fully equipped libraries are established 
and made accessible to allthe people. In nearly all our cities, and in many villages, 
there have been established what are known as working school libraries—selection 
of books adapted to the different grades of schools, and more especially designed to 
aid in the teaching of literature, history, geography, and science. These books are 
kept by the teacher of each grade, and are made very accessible to the pupils of the 
school. Further than this, courses of reading have been mapped out for the pupils, 
and the teachers have sought to lead pupils to read these books, and converse with 
the teacher on the topics read. In this way a taste for reading has been formed in 
many instances, and a better spirit of study has been the direct result of this read- 
ing. Besides this, the parents of these pupils have oftentimes become interested in 
reading, and the pupils have been encouraged to start a little library of their own. 
Who can estimate the value of such beginnings? Parents will find that the question 
of keeping the boy at home evenings is very largely solved when the same boy shall 
 
-P-A-G-E-436
1654 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93, 
become interested in the reading of good books. We are tho heirs of all the ages 
in literature as well as in the more material things of which we boast. The publica- 
tion of inexpensive editions of our classics has aided very materially in this spread 
of general intelligence and love for reading. 
School architecture—Miscellaneous suggestions.—We give herewith some miscella- 
neous suggestions which should be carefully considered by those about to build 
schoolhouses. 
1, The window-lighting surface should equal one-fifth of the floor surface. 
2. No pupil should sit farther from the window than two and one-half times the 
distance from the floor to the top of the window. 
3. The window should extend to the ceiling, only leaving enough room for the 
easing between the opening and the ceiling. 
4, The windows should be grouped. 
5. Light is better from both sides than from one side and the back. The light at 
the back, unless high, will cast the pupil’s shadow on his work. 
6. There should be no windows for pupils to face. 
7. Light from one side should be from the left, so as not to throw the shadow of 
the pupil’s hand upon his work. 
8. The windows should be provided with green shades; yellow is not as good for 
the eyes. 
9. The blackboards should not have a glossy surface. 
10. If windows are grouped as they should be, and as they are in the accompany- 
ing sketches, no blackboards come between windows to try the eyes of the pupils. 
Heating and ventilating.—1. A wood furnaee is the cheapest and best means of heat- 
ing small schoolhouses where wood is abundant. The furnace heats and ventilates 
and will burn long wood, knots, branches, ete., that can not be used in a stove. 
2, A jacketed stove is the next best heater and ventilator. A round, tall stove 
should be incased by a sheet-iron jacket, the jacket being placed 4 or 6 inches 
from the stove. The jacket should reach within 2 inches of the floor, and extend 
to top of stove. Air conductors 6 by 12 inches should lead from the wall on two 
opposite sides of the schoolhouse under the floor, and open into a register imme- 
diately under the stove. This furnishes fresh air. Dampers can be placed in these 
ducts to regulate the amount of fresh air. A good stove and jacket can be bought 
for $25 or $40. 
8. The chimneyshould extend to the ground and contain a flue 2 feet square, with 
either a brick partition dividing it into two parts or an 8-inch chimney tile for 
smoke flue. This smoke flue warms the shaft, creates a current upward, and thus 
the impure air of the room may be drawn off. 
4, Flues built into walls without provision for warming them are merely monu- 
ments to fools. 
5. Place alarge register in the room at base of chimney, and also one in the chimney 
near the ceiling. Let both be provided with valves with which to close them when 
necessary. 
6. Place a ventilator in ceiling of room near the center, opening into the attic. 
7. Hang windows with cards and weights if possible, or at least make them easy 
of movement, and supplied with easy catches at lifts of short intervals. Place a 
5-inch beard under lower sash of window, just as long as windowis wide. This will 
ereate a space between upper and lower sash, through which the air can come in 
without direct draft on pupils. 
8. Occasionally open doors and windows, and let the air change while pupils are 
marching or exercising. 
Miscellanecous.—1. Wardrobes for country schools are better made of wainscoting 
6 or8 feet high, at both sides of entrance door, in the schoolroom. Those old entries 
are great breeders of disorder. 
2. The girls and boys should haye separate wardrobes. 
3. The teacher’s desk should be in the opposite end of the room from the entrance. 
4, The end of the room opposite the entrance should have no windows. 
5, The blackboard should extend across the end of the reom back of the teacher’s 
desk and down each side to the windows. It will do no harm to run the blackboard 
the length of both sides as well as one end. 
6. Ifnecessary, stand over the builder with a club to make him put the blackboards 
low enough for the little people. The side boards should be within 2 feet of the 
floor and made 4 feet wide. The end board should be 6 feet wide. 
8. The floor should be of narrow and well-seasoned maple. Do not put in a soft 
wood floor. 
8. Provide a neat wood box if no fuel room is 
9. Provide at least one extra chair for stray visitors. 
10. There should be an average of 16 square feet of floor space to each pupil. A 
little increase in the dimensions of the building does not add materially to the 
expense, but adds much to health and comfort of pupils.

{From Report of State Supt. J. R. Preston for 1802-93.] 
FLOURISHING CONDITION OF TOWN AND VILLAG 
  SCHOOLS, 
The ayerage country school, as it has been conducted, could command the respect 
of neither pupil nor patron, and has served, in many instances, but to pension 
incompetent kindred of trustees, to blunt every educational aspiration of our youth, 
and rob them of precious days and golden opportunities. The time has come to 
stop dallying with so serious an interest of the Commonwealth. 
The towns of our State, recognizing the futility of a four months’ term, have 
organized into separate school districts, and annually raise enough money by local 
taxation to extend their term to seven months in all the smaller towns, and to eight, 
eu ten months in the larger ones—the average term being more than eight 
months. 
The new constitution diminished the revenues of many of the separate school dis- 
tricts, and occ ned a stricter economy, and in some instances a shortening of the 
term; butin ev case the towns have met the emergency, increased the local levy, 
and will maintain their schools eight or nine months. 
The people in our towns have gone to great expense besides in building and equip- 
ping schoolhouses. They recognize the value of education, and are determined that 
their children shall have every reasonable opportunity in an educational line. 
In the last two years the number of separate school districts has increased from 41 
to 58, showing that our towns and villages are forging to the front in providing school 
facilities for their children. 
Several of the smaller towns have enlarged their school districts by embracing some 
adjacent rural territory upon petition of the freeholders thereof. 
The schools of all the separate districts are reported as being in a flourishing con- 
dition and crowded with pupils to the limit of their capacity. 
As indicated in the last biennial report, these municipalities had to make, in most 
instances, aslight increase in their local schooltax; but no serious hindrance of their 
progress and efficiency has been occasioned by the change in our school revenue system. 
The increase in the number of separate school districts and their steady progress 
eines se healthy tone of public sentiment which follows great local effort in behalf 
of schoois, 
The course of study in nearly all of these schools is sufficient to prepare students 
to enter the freshman class of the university and the other State institutions. They 
are, moreover, contributing to the rural schools many well-prepared, active, and pro- 
gressive teachers. 
Numerous changes of principals and superintendents have taken place within the 
one few years, indicating that the people are seeking stronger men to conduct their 
schools. 
A system of schools seldom rises above the idea of the principal or superintendent, 
and most often is but a reflection of that ideal. 
The chief function of trustees is to put the right man in charge of the schools. 
The quality of manhood in a principal is a silent molding power that stamps its 
impress on the character and destiny of every pupil. It operates not simply in tho 
school room and on the play ground, but follows children into their homes, is with 
them during vacations, and registers itself in their conduct as future citizens of the 
Conmimen wealth. 
Most of the separate school districts have provided school libraries. 
          
        
        
  =   
DISTRICT LIBRARIES, 
  A library composed of popular and standard literature is a nec 
every public*school. \ 
The highest function of the public school is to create and cultivate the reading 
habit. Herein lies its chief power to promote culture among the masses. 
Our country homes have but few books, and these generally of a kind unattractive 
to children, Many young people are reaching the age of maturity without ever hay- 
ing read_a book. 
Our schools must set to work to collect small libraries of readable books and place 
them in the hands of the children. A little cooperative effort by the neighborhood 
will supply the means to purchase twenty or thirty volumes. Even this small num- 
ber, if well selected and wisely used by the teacher, will suffice to lead the pupils 
into communion with the great apostles of the world’s thought, to create within 
then a new source of happiness, to uplift them ultimately to a state of intellectual 
reedom. : ary adjunct to

EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
PROPRIETARY HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES, 
In addition to our separate school districts we have 233 high schools, academies, 
and colleges, The enrollment in these institutions for 1892-93 was 22,859, and all of 
them give more or less secondary instruction. 
These schools include all denominational institutions, and, except eight or ten, 
are conducted upon the coeducation plan. Most of them are effective factors in the 
education of the youth of the State. 
Nearly all of them during the public school term conduct their departments below 
the high school as public schools. 
A high degree of credit must be conceded to a majority of these institutions; but 
some of them are unworthy of the patronage they secure through artful and delu- 
sive pretenses. 
When a school claims that in one year it can teach a course of mathematics from 
algebra to calculus, or can give a classical education in two years, the wise parent 
ath ends that it is a humbug and look for another school in which to educate 
is child, 
We need to get rid of all such educational shams. ° 
A DEPARTMENT OF PEDAGOGY FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITY. 
The establishment of a department of pedagogy in the university is a step of prog- 
ress which reflects credit upon the wisdom of the trustees of this great institution 
of learning. 
The department of pedagogy will articulate the university with the public school 
system of the State and by degrees put university men at the head of most of our 
town and city public schools, which will unify and harmonize our educational work. 
Young men and women of the State who wish to become teachers will turn to the 
university for professional instruction, and the people will naturally apply there 
when they wish scholarly and well-trained teachers. 
With no normal school in the State, this department should be crowded from year 
to year by those who aim to make themselves better teachers. Tho day is not far 
distant when an applicant without professional training need not apply for a position 
inany important public schoolin Mississippi. The sooner trustees exact professional 
training as a condition precedent to election, the speedier will be the progress of their 
schools. 
Already there is happily a growing tendency in this direction. Many scholarly 
young men have been rejected within the past few years simply because they had no 
professional training. Scholarships of prime importance. No acquaintance with 
methods and devices can take its place; but it is equally essential that the scholar 
be trained to teach, if he expects to meet the demands of any position of prominence 
in our schools. 
The people are fast learning that the very worst investment they can mako is to 
emp loy a poor teacher for their children, and the day is at hand when teachers must 
invest liberally in the acquisition of professional training before they enter the pro- 
fession, and must annually spend a part of their salaries in self-improvement. 
TEACHERS’ PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIES, ‘ 
  Jnder the law allowing 20 per cent of the surplus institute fund to be invested in 
works on teaching, to be kept by the county superintendent for the use of teachers, 
more than half the counties have purchased libraries containing from 20 to 300 vol- 
umes each. At the county institutes the past summer contributions were made by 
the teachers for enlarging these libraries and for the purchase of libraries in coun- 
ties were none had been procured, so that by the end of the present scholastic year 
nearly every county will be provided with the best works on teaching. These 
libraries will be increased from year to year, and in a short while the public school 
teachers of Mississippi will have free access to the very best educational thought of 
the world. Our teachers can now pursue a course of professional reading with no 
outlay for books; reading circles and associations can be formed to master prescribed 
courses; educational theories can be studied in the light of daily experience, The 
establishment and use of these libraries will ultimately exert a potent influence in 
uplifting the teachers and bringing them to a true appreciation of the dignity of their 
profession.

[From report of State Sapt. L. E. Wolfe for 1892-93.] 
A REFORM URGED IN THE ELEMENTARY COURSE OF STUDY, 
It was once thought sufiicient to educate the few. The education of the many is 
an idea of comparatively recent origin. Our universities and colleges are aristo- 
cratic in their origin, their design, their scope, their courses of stndy, and methods. 
IT use the term aristocratic not in an edious sense. By its use I mean that these 
institutions reach the few in distinction from the many. From the very nature of 
things, they can reach but a small per cent of the people. They were originally 
designed to prepare for the learned professions, especially for the ministry and law. 
The time came when States, in the interest both of humanity and public welfare, 
decided to make the education of all a public charge. 
Thero has not been sufficient time to make the public school courses of study and 
methods as democratic as tho systems are in their scope and design. Tho design of 
our free school systems is to reach the masses; yet we cling to the courses of study 
and methods modeled after those in universities and colleges, that, from the very 
nature of things, can reach only the few. We must remember that the day of uni- 
versal education at public expense has but fairly dawned; the sun hangs low in the 
eastern horizon. ‘There has not been sufficient time to create a harmonious whole. 
These higher institutions of learning being designed to prepare for the learned pro- 
fessions, their courses of study were shaped with reference to graduation. If the 
student fell by the wayside before graduation, it was his own fault. When free 
school systems were established, their courses of study were modeled largely after 
those of the college. These courses of study, while professedly for the many, are 
really for the few. Although a large per cent of the pupils drop out of schoo} 
before reaching the fourth grade, but little work is done in the majority of schools 
below the fourth grade in oral geography, and in the applications of addition, sub- 
traction, multiplication, and division. Although three-fourths of the pupils leave 
school before reaching the eighth year of school life, not one school in twenty gives 
instruction below grade 8 in the elements of the natural sciences, in elementary 
history, civil government, political economy, and literature. 
Our courses of study seem to have been framed without a recognition of the fact 
that these pupils, without training in the natural sciences, without any knowledge 
of their country’s history, with no intimation of the world’s history, with no 
instruction with regard to the social units so near and vital—the school district, 
the township, the county—that these pupils are to become heads of families, and are 
to wield the ballots that are to shape the destiny of our country. We apply the 
spurs to the geograplical hobby through grades 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, apparently oblivi- 
ous, not only of the great events of the world’s history, but of the thrilling events 
in the history of our country. Is it because pupils below grade 8 would not take an 
interest in these events? Oh, no; it is simply that we aro slaves to custom; that we 
have been unable to overcome the inertia of the past; that we have not had suffi- 
cient time to mako our free school systems democratic in their courses of study and 
methods. Pupils of the second and third grades, if given an opportunity, would 
read with great relish fairy tales and folk stories. In grades 3, 4, and 5 they would 
read with equal relish Kingsley’s Greek Heroes, Ten Boys on the Road from Long 
Ago Till Now, Abbott’s Cyrus and John Esten Cooke’s Stories of the Old Dominion. 
In grades 5, 6, and 7 they would read with interest and profit elementary books of 
civil government and political economy. 
Again, why, when we take up United States history, should we be expected to 
memorize the thousand unimportant details of battles? Why not give some of this 
time to interesting historical or biographical sketches in the world’s history? Again, 
we are expected to grind the selections of the readers over and over, again and again, 
squandering valuable time that could be given to the reading of a number of choice 
literary wholes. It is not enough to study the examples in arithmetic growing out 
of actual life. We must ransack algebra in order to devise improbable, impractical, 
and artificial hare-and-hound problems. It is not enough to study practical arithme- 
tic; we must push the study into abstruse and impractical higher arithmetic, thus 
wasting time that should be given not only to a better understanding of practical 
arithmetic, but to obtaining an elementary knowledge of points, lines, surfaces, and 
solids. Writing and drawing must also be ground very fine, and strung out very 
Jong—made as abstruse as possible. 
This reform course of study herein offered does the best thing possible for every 
pupil, regardless of his station in life, and regardless of the number of years he is 
permitted to remain in school. If from caprice or misfortune he leaves school at the 
end of the third year, hé has the best the school can give him. The same is true if 
he leaves the school at grade 5 or 8. At whatever point he leaves school, he would   
  
   
   
-P-A-G-E-440
1658 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
havo received somo training in observation along the enfiroe line in both the domain 
‘of nature and man, and if he had learned to read, his reading would be along the 
same liberal and extended line. Such a course of study would not only give the 
pupil the best possible preparation for life, regardless of when he left school, but 
also the best preparation for subsequent studies either in the high grades of the 
common school or in secondary institutions of learning or university. This course 
of study would hasten the articulation of the common schools, secondary schools, 
and universities; would bring about a rational articulation without sacrificing tho 
interests of the common schools, secondary schools, or the universities. The passport 
toa higher grade or institution would not be an ability to disgorge a gorged memory, 
but toobserve and read intelligently, and to express the results of that observation 
and reading in good English. Inspiration and power rather than information would 
become the basis of promotion. No articulation that does not consider the interests 
of all the institutions concerned can bring the best results. The articulation that 
is based upon the best interests of the common schools is the one from which the 
secondary schools and universities will derive the most profit. 
Life is a very practical thing. By this I do not mean to unduly emphasize the 
utilitarian at the expense of the ethical and esthetic. Reader, have you gone among 
the people—the plain, common people—and looked again and again at education from 
their standpoint? Have you, in imagination, lived over your childhood? Does our 
public school system seem to have been constructed with special reference to the 
needs of the people? Does it do the most to enlarge, tostrengthen, and perfect their 
lives? Does it go to them ina spirit of helpfulness, or does it invite them to come to 
it? Is our system giving them that for which they are hungering? They are asking 
bread and fish, and we are giving them serpents and stones. They ery aloud for 
trained powers of observation, that they may have better food, clothing, shelter, 
and transportation; that they may appreciate and enjoy the beauties of nature 
attending them by night and day. In return, we gorge their memories on geography 
and the books of naturalscience. They seek companionship with the good and great 
through their books; we give them five readers composed of extracts. 
Do you say that this is not the province of school, but of life? I reply that child- 
hood and youth is preeminently the time for such training; the period when the 
senses and curiosity are most active; life will be full of other duties; the to-morrow 
of neglected opportunity will never come. An instruction that does not make the 
son and daughter more helpful to their parents, that does not lay hold upon the hands 
and feet, lacks e ency. There is something wrong about an education that does 
not enable the farmer’s son to look more carefully after the condition of the erops, 
the stock, the gates, and fences; the daughter to be more interested, ingenious, and 
helpfal in cooking, sewing, and housekeeping. 
I hear a widespread complaint that “schooling” turns boys and girls against 
work. Is it not strange that history—a recital of decds—shonld disincline pupils 
to deeds in their own sphere—in aavord, to work? Go largely among parents, end 
you will find a general belief that some strang d wonderful power inheres in the 
text-book, and especially in that knowledge tha so hidden by teehnical terms as 
to be unintelligible to the masses. The pedantry of teachers is in no small degree 
responsible for our present course of study and methods; a desire to possess terms— 
if not knowledge—not understood by the people. We teachers still act out our 
little part; puppet-like, we still dance at the behest of custom; still pay tribute to 
the effete past. Our pupils still perpetuate their wordy parades on examination and 
commencement days. Our graduates, with but little knowledge of composition, 
manage to deliver themselves of essays and orations, which, with “learned length 
and thundering sound, amaze the gazing rustics, ranged around.” It may be 
remarked, in passing, that the teacher is no less amazed than the audience. When 
will we cease this array of pedantry and tho artificial, and be perfectly sincere and 
honest withthe people? Our systems of education must get simpler and more help- 
ful though the heavens fall. I learned of an inspired preacher who draws his hun- 
dreds of thousands, and upon hearing him, find his secret to be simplicity and 
helpfulness. Eager to catch a glimpse of the world’s great paintings, I find them 
portraying the meek and the lowly one in the World, The Last Muster, Break- 
ing Family Ties. The short and simple annals of the poor will ever be the inspiration 
of literature. 
Pestalozzi indeed came preaching the gospel of sense-perception in the wilderness 
of memory culture, and we do him lip service in every convention of teachers, but 
the actual work of the average schoolroom shows that our hearts are far from him. 
For twelve long years, Horace Mann, the illustrious apostle of Pestalozzi, with the 
energy of despair, made his eloquent plea for ideas before words, throughout the 
length and breadth of Massachusetts, and we love to do him honor; and yet, in the 
average school, the gluttony of. the memory goes on. Herbart, the apostle of 
apperception, numbers his followers by the tens of thousands, and yet, in practice, 
the doctrine of the correlation and concentration of studies is a stranger in four- 
fifths of the schoolrooms,

Shall our great systems of education, with their superb machinery, drift farther 
and further from the people, or shall we hasten to learn the lessons of simplicity, 
helpfulness, and wisdom? These reforms are coming just as sure as the water seeks 
the sea. Already there are ominous mutterings among the people. It may be that 
no member of our profession is destined to lead these reforms to final and completo 
triumph. We are a conservative body. It may be that to achieve these reforms, 
“some John the Baptist, feeding on locusts and wild honey, and with a leather girdle 
about his loins, must come forth from among the people. Be it so; thus have been 
compassed tho world’s greatest reforms, 
ADDRESS OF REY. EDWARD EVERETT HALE AT THE OPENING OF THE NEW ST, LOUIS 
PUBLIC LIBRARY BUILDING, 
{The exercises connected with the formal opening of the new building for the St. 
Louis public library were held February 17, 1893. The library at that date num- 
bered 90,000 volumes, having increased threefold since the present librarian, Mr. 
Frederick M. Crunden, took chargein 1877. Rey. E. E. Hale delivered the following 
dedicatory address :] 
It is impossible, for the people of any community which has not fully tried it, tor 
foresee the joy to individuals which they are making possible. No man can foresee 
the happiness of homes which is thus made possible. No man can foresee the eleva- | 
tion and advanco of social life and public order. No man can foretell the special 
occasions in which some new Watt is to be trained to build some new steam-engine, 
in which some new Edison is to be trained for new discoveries in science, in which 
some new Walter Scott is to be educated for the happiness of millions upon millions. 
Victories, which can not be written before they are achieved, are all inthe germ when 
wo plant the acorn. Or, if you call it a mustard seed, no man shall say what birds 
shall take shelter, what travelers shall rest, under the shade of that tree of which 
you plant the germ to-day. Far less shall any man say what conquests shall be 
achieved by the travelers who from this rest and this shade go forward upon new 
duty. 
I speak, in some sort, as an expert. I have seen the public library of my own 
home begin with a little collection of public documents in asnuffy little room in the 
city hall. I have seen it grow till it takes possession of the most costly building 
in New England. From a thousand books, I think, tho gift of a retiring mayor, it 
has increased till it is now one of the largest libraries in the world. But it is not 
because I have seen this growth that I am saying what Isay. It is because I may 
see any day a cabman, on his stand, reading one of its brown paper- covered volumes. 
It is because I have seen the thoughtful mechanic come out from ono of its private 
rooms where he had been at work, “in his leisure hours, on the most careful and recon- 
dite problems of the mathematics, perhaps extending their discoveries. It is because 
I hayo seen the first artists of America meet there to study what elsewhere they 
could not find, the steps in some line of composition or invention. It is because I 
know that the rank and file of the city of Boston would more readily rise in rebel- 
lion against any city government which neglected to provide for their library than 
if they had been wounded at any other point of their social life. After thirty years’ 
experience, this has come to be the law and understanding; you may retrench on 
the right hand and on the left, you may cut down the s2 alary of’ the mayor, you may 
leave the strects narrow, you may have a bad fire department, you may go to the 
dogs in any other direction; but beware how you put a finger on the appropriation 
for the public library! T he people of that city, even those who you would say were 
of the most ignorant and thoughtless grade, have tasted the blood of life; and having 
tasted it onco, they will not forego their feast. They know what it is to have the best . 
books in the world at theircommand. They and their wives and their children know ' 
what this i is. Having once feasted at that board, they mean that the steward and 
the cook shall purvey y for them as well to-morrow as they did yesterday. £ 
As I go forward it is my hope and effort to illustrate my prophecies ‘by one or two* 
simple details which will at least throw what the artists call ‘broken lights” upon 
my picture; and I will try to make you believe that Iam not speaking extravagantly. 
In the presence of the distinguished librarian of this society—a gentleman whose 
name is known all over the English-speaking world, among the leaders in his busi- 
ness for the tact and skill which he has brought to administration—I shall certainly 
speak modestly. I claimed to be an expert, but still speak as an outsider speaks, 
and not as ore personally concerned in the administration of these great institutions. 
I beg to be understood as speaking as a child of the publie, who has fared with other 
children of the public, when we come to the festival of which I have spoken. My 
ticket is as good as theirs and no better. In what Iam to say, I am glad to be under: 
stood as pleading for all sorts and conditions of men. I shall beg you, as I go on, to 
remember where the leaders of men so often como from. I do not remember that 
you found Jenny Lind in the court circles of Sweden. I know you found Ben

  Franklin in a tallow-chandler’s shop. I think Abraham Lincoln had never been sent 
to a gilt-edged academy, and never graduated at a college of a thousand genera- 
tions. I am speaking in a nation where every soldier carrics a marshal’s baton in 
his knapsack, and it is so speaking that I am taking it for granted that this city of 
St. Louis, which has so weil forecast the future in a hundred enterprises, highly 
resolves to-night that in the future, in this business of books, the ration of the pri- 
vate who is tramping on foot’ with his musket on his shoulder shall be the same 
ration which the Secretary of War is to digest to-night, or the commander in chief 
of the great Army. It is two hundred and fifty years sinco the real people of this 
country highly resolved that every child born into it should be taught to read and 
write, and should share at the common charge in the effort for education, which 
other countries had made only for their priests and their rule It is two centuries 
and a half since such people as there were in this country highly resolved that for 
them, and with us and with our children, church and state should be ruled by the 
people of America, When they resolved this they meant that all America should 
be what we now call a school for the training of soldiers; that all America should 
be as a divinity school for the training of priests, so that every nan might be his 
own priest, and hold his own personal relation to God; that all America should bea 
school for the education of sons and daughters of the King, so that the meanest brat 
born in the meanest hovel might be able to read the Word of Life, or the law of life, 
as well as the child shaded under purple curtains in the palace of anemperor. ‘True, 
when the fathers made this high decision they did not anticipate to-day. There 
had not been so many words printed in the world when the United States was 
founded as were printed in America yesterday, either in the form of journals or of 
separate volumes. The fathers who founded universal education, therefore, did not 
in the same statutes establish universal public libraries. But, if they could have 
forecast the future of type and stereotype and power presses, the future of to-day, 
they would have founded public libraries for everybody. And we, who are in that 
future—we who know what a book is, and how many books there are—we have no 
idea of limiting any son of God or daughter of God to the 5, 10, or 50 books which 
he ean bring together in hisown home. We have learned the great lesson that books 
aro the universal property of the world, and that the light which is lighted is to be 
put upon a candlestick; it is not to be shut up under any bushel. 
We, who are not ashamed of the name of nationalists, do not expect the great 
victories of cooperation in life to be wrought in one hour, in one , or in one 
century. We observe, however, that they have been won already—in a steady 
evolution. We see with gratitude that this nation has from the beginning been 
ready to strengthen the hands of its Government whenever and wherever the Gov- 
ernment acted for each and for all in the establishment of popular education. Thus 
the fathers determined that one child should have the same chance as another child. 
Gradually, in the establishment of their armies, they determined that every man 
must bear a gun, and that not the ono military class, but the whole nation must 
serve the state. It followed, when they came to questions of suffrage, that they 
guve the suffrage to every man who had carried the firelock and had risked his life 
for his country. So when, in any city, one wanted to fulfill the Saviour’s demand, 
and give the cup of cold water to thé brother who was in need, the people of the American cities, as by instinct, saw that this water must be cold water, thatit must 
be pure water, that it must be God’s water, not defiled by human filth or iniquity. 
And, without asking under what power they did this, the great cities, as by one 
step, marched forward, so that the beggar might wash in water as pure as that 
which flowed for the baths of a palace. The American law is that, if the necessity 
is a necessity for each child of God, and is the same for each child of God, to each 
child of God it shall be given, at the public charge. 
That child may be blind; still the state will see that he is taught to read. He may 
be deaf; still the state devises the method by which he shall be taught to hear. 
Poor thing, he may be deaf and dumb and blind; still the state folds him in her 
arms, soothes him on her bosom, and you find that by some magic or miracle she has 
taught him how to speak, how to remember, how to think, and how to live. In such 
determination that the meanest and the worst shall be nursed and cherished as the 
noblest and the best, the state does not know the meaning of the word ‘‘extrava- 
gance.” 
Now, even in what I have said, you have observed, you could not but observe, that 
the very words which we use are all tangled in with our thoughts of what a free pub- 
lic library can do, and what this library is going to do for the people who will use 
it. Thus, when we speak of “light” to-day, why, we hardly know whether we 
speak of the light which comes from one of Mr. Edison’s incandescent burners, or 
whether we speak of the light which comes to a man as he reads from his New Testa- 
ment, as he commits one of Tennyson’s poems to memory, or as he follows along on 
the words of stimulus and suggestion which George Eliot has written down for him, 
or William Thackeray, or any other mistress of life, or master. It is all light, and it 
shines for all. It is interesting, indeed, to see how, in the common talk and common + 
            
    
      
    
    
-P-A-G-E-443
  MISSOURI. 1661 
thought of people, they have even come round to feel that tho use of these intellectual 
facilities presupposes moral excellence and spiritualrefinement. We carry it farther 
than we ought to carry it. When we say of one of our neighbor’s boys that he is a 
nuisance to the neighborhood, he is all the time in the street, we say of his brother, 
““Thereis a good boy ; he always has his book and is sitting by the fireside reading.” 
We really think that reading is virtue. This is because wo have found out that in 
the training of the memory there comes in the training of the moral sense, and in the 
long run we find ourselves more willing to trust the Watt, the Franklin, the Edison, 
the Lincoln, who have spent their time in diligent reading, than those who have not 
concentrated thought, attention, memory, imagination, or any of the faculties of the 
mind; those who have let them go wild, and perhaps result in nothing. 
And we are sure that where street arabs, or dreaming ladies, or men of affairs are 
lured into the crypts of our libraries we are going to have a sufirage more pure, 
administration more strong, finance more simple. We know that, as fast and as far 
as we tempt them by our devices to eat wisely and well of tho true tree of knowledge, 
they will cat of the fruit of the tree which is the good tree. The tree best named, 
the tree of life eternal! 
There are some conditions of life which we take as things of course; we see them 
always and we are not grateful for them. They do not surprise us. Here amI! I 
could stand on one of your great bridges and look hour for hour on your great river 
as it flows by St. Louis. And perhaps there is not a manin this audience who could 
stand by my side there without being bored to death. 2 
You are used to your river. To me, the miracle is wholly new. Now, just as you 
take the flow of your river, so does the average American, who knows what America 
is, take the happy, healthful flow of universal education, We take it for granted 
that amancanread. Ifhe cannot read hemay goand perish. ‘Served him right,” 
is the verdict of the coroner. ‘Look out for the engine’—thatis the warning to the 
traveler in all our wildernesses, or whatever they may be called and whatever the 
name of the engine. The warning is printed in large letters for him toread it. Vain 
for him to say, when he picks up the pieces of his carriage, when he collects one or 
two buckles of the harness, after the catastrophe which is only not fatal—vain for 
him to say that the letters above his head were unintelligible to him. ‘‘ Whose fault 
is it that he can not read?” “It is no fault of ours,” we say; ‘‘and he will know 
better another time.” 
To learn the value of your river here you need to be on the top of a waterless 
ranch in Montana, with your dumb sheep or oxen gathering around you, begging you 
with their plaintive eyes to give them a drop of cold water to cool their tongues. 
To know the value of universal education, you need to travel in some country, 
where not one man in ten knows A from Z, or whether the letters ‘‘b-o” spell ‘‘cat” 
or spell “mouse.” 
In Spain, which is like America, in that it is a country of gentlemen, I have said 
to a railway porter in his own language, ‘‘Chevalier, might I trouble you to take 
that valise across the street to the hotel,” to have the good fellow answer me as 
courteously, ‘Chevalier, I will tuke the valise with the greatest pleasure so soon 
as the chevalier yonder, who can read, will come and read to all fifteen of us the 
directions on the luggage.” 
Till we have had some such experience, you and I do not know what it is to wait 
at a ticket window for a clerk to be called who can go through that mystic process 
which shall show how much four tickets will cost when all the company knows that 
43 cents is the price of one. Our machine of life here rnns on so steadily with our 
system of univ 1 education that we do not stop to think how it would groan and 
falter if we had failed to oil the wheels. 
Shall we, however, set this great engine to running, and then give it nothing to 
do? Shall we teach every man, woman, and child in the nation to read, and then 
give them nothing but baggage tags and danger signals for their reading? Is my 
boy to be initiated into the mystery of numbers, is he to get an idea of those intri- 
cate mysteries of algebra and geometry and what grew from them, and then is he 
to be satisfied with calculating that 4 times 43 is 172? Are we to train dragoons, 
skirmishers, riflemen, and light infantry, and then shut them all up in a fortress and 
tell them that their duty is to police the parade grounds of the garrison? These are 
the questions to which America has now come. These are the questions which Mr. 
Crunden and these gentlemen who have called us here are asking you to-night. It 
is not enough that the boys and the girls, the men and the women of the nation 
should read the placards in the streets, whether they advertise tragedies or comedies, 
mustard or pepper. It is not enough that they should be satisfied with anything 
ephemeral, and even the daily newspaper, in its pride, has to acknowledge that it is 
nothing more. The time has come; nay, it came long ago, when man, woman, and 
child had a right to claim the best for reading. Theirs shall be the gate to all past 
history, unlocked and thrown open. Theirs shall be the other gate, to yesterday’s 
research and discovery, thrown wide open as well. We ought to open to them the 
path through the garden in which the poets shall sing for them, in which Shake-

Jead them through hell itself to purgatory and to heaven. Has any man found a 
philosophy which tells him how to live? Let it be theirs! Has any Columbus or

any son of God spoken words which bring the Father nearer to His children? 
These are not gifts for any upper ten thousand of the world. These are not like 
diamonds and rubies, to be locked up in caskets or store chambers for the unhappy 
people who are imprisoned in palaces. They are the infinite bounty of God for all 
sorts and conditions of men—as the rain descends upon the evil and the good; as 
the sunshine blazes for the just and for the unjust. That the dew may thus distill 
in the darkest corner and en the dryest soil, we establish and maintain our free 
public library. 
All that I have said is absolutely commonplace. For ihat reason I saidit. For I 
am now to rush in, as fools will you know, where even angels might fear to tread, 
I am to say now what only a stranger can say on an occasion like this and be 
excusable. You will please remember, then, that I am wholly a stranger to your 
councils. Since I arrived here only yesterday, I may say I have taken pains not 
to inquire about your work in the past, or your plans in the future. Buton general 
principles, I can guess that Mr. Crunden on one hand has some plans of extravagant 
audacity, and that on the other hand he has some reserves which the public and even 
his friends can not account for, and which they say belong to the superstitions of his 
profession. 
On the other hand, I can take it for granted without being told that in the board 
of trustees there are reverses and delays which the whole press of St. Louis ridi- 
cules, and yet that'there are some audacious extravagancies lying latent which strike 
Mr, Crunden aghast when they are whispered to him. Of all this I know nothing, 
but that where bodies of honorable, intelligent, and courageous men are intrusted 
with a great public enterprise it must beso. I have repeated my commonplaces 
and compelled you to hear them, that here and now, on the birthday of this library, 
I may say one thing to everybody. It is the sathe thing to some errand boy or run- 
ner who shall carry a straw’s weight of the responsibility of this library as to the gen- 
tlemen yonder who are going to draw up their wills before they sleep to-night, and 
leave to this library the legacy of their fortunes. The great truth is this: Books 
are made to read. 
I give it to you as a motto to be printed in gold On the main frieze of your largest hold. 
They are not made to be locked up in bookcases. 
The greatest credit to a library is its ability to report at the end of the year that a 
large number of its books have been worn out in clear and honest service. The 
Pharisees thought that man was made for the Sabbath, but the Savior taught them 
thatthe Sabbath wasmadefor men. So there are Pharisees who think that books were 
made to be kept on shelves, but the truth is that shelves and eases and aleoves and 
corridors and stacks and catalogues and runners and desk clerks and assistants and 
librarians and trustees all exist so that books may be put into the hands of readers. 
The sooner a book is worn out the better, so that it be carefully handled and honestly 
used. 
Ido not say that the book must be taken outside the library walls. That depends. 
You are doing a good thing for students when you train them as the British Museum 
trains them, that they must study where the books are. If one hundred men can 
consult a volume in one day, as in their almost matchless reading room, that book 
may do a hundred times as much good in a day as if it had been carried home by a 
student. Thisis mere matter of detail. ButI repeat the words, I care not how often, 
so I can fix them upon the memory of anybody whois responsible. ‘‘ Books are made 
to read! Books are made to read! Books are made to read! They have no other 
purpose or object under heaven!” 
“Of course they are!” says everybody in this audience, and half the audience add 
the thought which they are too civil to express, ‘‘ What a fool the man is, to come all 
the way from Boston to tellus that! Or what fools the trustees were to invite him!” 
I beg your pardon. I have in other times been bullying a board of trustees who 
held that Pharisee doctrine. And one of them said to me, ‘‘ Why! Mr. Hale, we 
hold this property in trust; we have reeeipted for it; we are like bankers whose stock- 
holders have paid them $1,000,000 in gold for their capital.” nd was I notdelighted 
when he gave me the simile; I hardly gave him time to finish his sentence. ‘Where 
would your bank be,” I cried, ‘if you had not lent that capital? Where would 
your stockholders be if you had tied their shekels up in napkins or, like that man 
in the other parable, if you had buried them under ground?” And then I read him 
a lesson, which I trust in God he has not forgotten, how thesoul of man is worth 
more than gold andsilver. By so much should he be more eager that these precious 
ingots which we have inherited from the mining and minting of all time should be 
freely sent and invested where their value is best known, When they return from

one errand of beneficence, at the instant, if we can, we must send them out upon 
another. With what pride, indeed! with what heavenly glow of satisfaction, might 
librarian or custodian hold up before us to-night some tattered and tear-marked volume, 
the gift to us of prophet or of sage, and say, ‘‘ This ragged book has comforted ten 
thousand mourners! I dare not tell you of the tears which it has consecrated. No 
man can speak to you of the blessings which from that volume have been set flowing 
over the desertsof the world.” It would be sacrilege to compare that glow of satis- 
faction with the vanity of the collector when he unlocks his safe and with dainty 
fingers hands to you the morocco and the paper which his particular agent, having 
carte blanche to draw from, bid in at the Apthorp sale. 
Books are made to read! They serve no other use under heaven. 
Do we indeed prize them as the marvels which they are? You and I go to a long- 
distance telephone; we listen, it may be, to a sweetheart’s whisper, if may be a 
brother’s langh; we catch the very accent. We recognize the tone, its humor, or its 
pathos. Well may we wonder; well may we thank God that we live in this day. 
She was with me in this little office; space was annihilated! Yes, and what is that 
marvel to the more familiar marvel! Mr. Crunden gives me this printed volume and 
Iam sitting with Homer on the heights of Chios, and without a sound he whispers 
to me of the rage of Achilles or the tears of Andromache. Or I lie on the bank of 
anemones in Sharon, and David tells me how the heavens declare the glory of God 
and the firmament showeth his handiwork. Let me enter Mr. Crunden’s halls, and 
for me there is no space, there is no time! 
If we highly resolve that for this generation, and the generations which follow, 
reading of the best books shall be the luxury and blessing of all sorts and conditions 
of men, the effort, the study, and the prayer which have combined to make this 
birthday of our library possible are answered and rewarded. If we know that 
books are made to read; if we highly resolve, as we love God and hope for heaven, 
that all men and women shall one day come to read them, why, the future is sure! 
The details will determine themselves. And each new invention of Mr. Crunden, 
each new victory of your trustees, will bud and blossom ina hundred more. Of 
these I dare not prophesy. In the legends of that fabled city of Sybaris, it is said 
that there were no locks on the library doors; they could always be opened; and 
the reading room was open from midnight to midnight, from New Year to New Year, 
from century to century. Mr. Crunden knows, your trustees know, whether such 
matchless success be possible in St. Louis. 
I am sure of this, because you people here are practical. I am sure no holiday 
will be too good for men to read in. In my own dear city, alas, we open the library 
for every day in the year when the people are at work, but we shut it in their faces 
on their few days of leisure. We let them read on Sunday, but not on their days 
of independence, fasting, or thanksgiving. I can not think you will imitateus. My 
parting wish for you shall be, that from the beginning you shall know that no day 
is too good a day to read of God’s Word or His works; that no festival is so sacred 
to independence but men may reap of the triumphs of the fathers; that no holiday 
of thanksgiving can be better spent than in praising God for the poets and the 
prophets. Surely it is not too much to ask of this central city, in that nation which 
is the central nation in the world, which is for our purposes the center of the uni- 
verse. So fast as the choicest treasures of that universe are collected here you will 
give the fullest opportunity for each man, woman, and child to enjoy them and to 
ess you. 
inex our child his name on his birthday. He is not only called “Library.” 
He has two names—he is called ‘‘Public Library.” Not for one is he sent on his 
road, not for four hundred, not for the upper ten. He is a messenger to the public, 
to each and to all. 
But, as I said, my mission is not one of adviee, but of congratulation. When, in 
1803, Robert Livingston, in many respects the first statesman, as he was the wisest 
prophet of his time, bought for $15,000,000 all the country between the Rocky Moun- 
tains and the Mississippi, he wrote thus to his prudent and careful master, Jefferson: 
“I know that the price paid is enormous. I have said to them that ina century 
we should not send ten thousand people across the Mississippi River.” 
Your fathers—nay, some of you—were among the first to disprove that prophecy. 
Their privilege and yours has been more than most men can boast to show what 
America is and is to be. Give her an object lesson, gentlemen and ladies, in the 
central matter, in the eentral work of education. Establish here the freest and 
best public library in the world.

    1664 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
NEW JERSEY. 
[From the report of State Supt. Addison B. Poland, for 1892-93.] 
STATE FUNDS SHOULD BE APPORTIONED ON THE BASIS OF NUMBER OF TEACHERS. 
It is clear that some steps should be taken to secure a larger percentage of increase 
in the teaching force of the State. 4 
I would suggest here that a remedy can be found in adopting a different basis for 
aeration of the State appropriation than that of school ceusus, as now pre- 
scribed. 
For instance, a district having a school population of 45 children or over draws 
from the State a sum not less than $375. One teacher only required, Now, an 
increase, say, of 45 more children in the district will largely increase the amount of 
State appropriation received. 
But no additional teacher is required; hence, the Jarger the number of children 
and the smaller the number of teachers the cheaper the cost of maintaining the 
schools of a district. 
Now I beg to recommend that the law be so amended as to make it for the interest 
of a district having 50 or more pupils attending school to employ an additional 
teacher. 
This can be easily effected by apportioning a part of the school tax on the basis of 
so much per teacher employed. ‘The State money is now appropriated wholly on 
the basis of number of children to be taught; how many are actually taught or how 
they are taught, whether by tens or by hundreds per teacher, makes no difference. 
This is essentially wrong. . The school law needs to be remedied at this vital point. 
    THE NEW JERSEY SYSTEM OF GRADING RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Under the New Jersey school law county superintendents have the power, by and 
with the approval of trustees, to prescribe a uniform course of study for their 
respective counties. For this reason, among others, a uniform State system has 
never been adopted. It has been thought best by my predecessors to leave the mat- 
ter of grading entirely in the hands of the county and city officers, and to discourage 
the adoptiou of a uniform State system, on the ground that a uniform State system 
for rural schools is no more needed than a uniform State system for city schools. 
The county superintendent stands, mutato nomine, in the same position as the city 
superintendent. A careful comparison, then, of the several county systems will 
show the following to be the essential features of them all: 
(1) A course of study consisling of five grades.—The first four covering all the work 
usually done in the primary and grammar schools of our best city systems; the last 
grade, the work of the first two years of the ordinary high school. This course is 
little more than a general outline of studies. It doesnot go into details in any sub- 
ject. In no case does it give more than the proper sequence of topics. It aims also 
to fix only approximately the time at which the work of any grade may be completed. 
This latter is important, since to fix definitely the time for the completion of a 
grade would be fatal to the system; it would not leave sufficient latitude for the 
special needs of particular schools. So also a detailed programme would tend to 
narrow and mechanize the work, as in some cities, where it is the bane of the system. 
By creating few grades it becomes possible for both rural and city schools to work 
together under the same course, since any subclassification may be made within 
three grades that the local conditions or exigencies of each district or city demand. 
While thus serving in a measure to unify the schools of a county, this system of 
grading does not reduce them to the inflexible, cast-iron classification which is so 
objectionable in many of our city systems. 
In my opinion, this happy division of the course into five grades (four below the 
high school and one high school), each representing about two years’ time for the 
average pupil, is the fundamental and saving feature of the New Jersey system. 
Eight or nine annual grades, as in the cities, would be impossible in rural schools; 
a greater number still more impossible. Such a classification would give rise to 
annual or semiannual promotions, which are entirely out of the question in rural 
schools. But five grades, on the other hand, with no stated time for completion, 
break up this system of periodic promotions. Bright pupils not infrequently cover 
the whole four grades below the high school in six or even four years’ time. So, also, 
a pupil may be at one and the same time in two or even three grades, according to 
his scholarship and capacity. It will be seen, therefore, that this grading by bien- 
nial periods interferes in nowise with the proper classification of pupils; it leaves 
the door open for all the intermediate grades or classes which local or accidental 
conditions make desirable or necessary. It is not necessary, for example, to find    
       
-P-A-G-E-447
  NEW JERSEY. 1665 
two or even three classes doing second-grade work in arithmetic or grammar; this 
will depend wholly upon the number of pupils in the school, their comparative pro- 
ficiency, and the time at the teacher’s disposal. So far from holding back bright 
pupils, the chief danger of the New Jersey system has been found to lie in its 
enabling them ‘to get on too rapidly. To counteract this tendency to complete the 
course too early, it has been found necessary in nearly every county to adopt a rule 
that no pupil shall be allowed to graduate under the age of 13 or 14 years. The 
point to be clearly apprehended is this: That the system of grading under discussion 
is not for the purpose of reducing to a minimum the number of classes, but for 
directing and especially for vitalizing the work of a school by the additional incen- 
tives that it introduces, as will be seen hereafter. In thec at least, every pupil 
is working wherever he can to the best advantage; if otherwise, it is not the result 
of the system, but of the natural and unavoidable conditions that limit the time of 
the teacher and consequently the number of recitations she is able to hear. It may 
be said, however, that the tendency of the system is to reduce somewhat the num- 
ber of daily recitations common in ungraded schools. 
(2) The second essential feature of this system is that it broadens the work of the county 
superintendent.—The success of a school depends largely upon the ability and intel- 
ligence of the teacher; the success of any system of grading, whether city or rural, 
depends also in a great measure upon the superintendent. This does not imply,    
   however, that some systems are not better than others. Some may be run with 
less friction; some produce better results than others. The graded system under     
  discussion needs just as careful supervision to make it efficient as a city system. 
Many, if not most, of the evils that attend the closely graded city system also 
appear in the ungraded rural schools, Thus, for instance, ‘‘marking time” will be 
found in its worst form not in the city, but in the ungraded country schools. 
I well remember how the district school teacher of my boyhood days always started 
the advanced class in arithmetic at common fractions. This enabled us to get on to 
percentage, say, at the end of the term. At the beginning of the next term it was 
the same old story—‘ The first class in arithmetic will begin at common fractions.” 
But in rural schools this evilof ‘‘marking time” is not due, as in the city systems, to 
annual or semiannual grading, but rather to no grading. The tendency of rural 
schools is always toward too many classes for economy in teaching; of city systems 
toward too few. There is a point where the two extremes meet. I believe it is 
found, so far as rural schools are concerned, in the system under discussion. But no 
system will make careful and intelligent supervision unnecessary. One of the chief 
advantages claimed for uniform grading is that it compels and encourages the county 
superintendent to live in the saddle, so to speak; to visit, inspect, and supervise his 
schools with indefatigable industry and untiring zeal. 
(3) Uniform county ecaminations.—It was early found in the history of the New 
rsey system that uniform examinations could be made an important and valuable 
accessory. These are held annually at or near the close of the school year. The 
questions are made out by the county superintendent. The examinations are con- 
ducted in the several schools by the principal or regular class teacher, by whom also 
the papers are all first examined and marked. The results are tabulated and sent 
to the county superintendent. In most counties, also, the papers of the three upper 
grades are submitted. to the county superintendent, who is assisted in reviewing 
them by a county board of examiners. 
By all who object to stated examinations this feature of the New Jersey system 
will be regarded as a defect. We must not, however, lose sight of the fact that 
examinations in rural schools are less frequent than in city schools, and for that 
reason are looked upon with much greater fayor by both pupils and teacher. Prop- 
erly conducted they are not only a great incentive to pupils, but are anticipated 
with pleasure. “The demoralizing effect of examinations as ordinarily conducted is 
due to the fact that a pupil’s promotion depends thereon. Remove this feature, as 
may be done under this system, and examinations are no longer a bugbear. A pupil’s 
promotion at the end of any given period will depend, under this system, upon the 
conditions that prevail when new classes come to be formed. The county examina- 
tions will be only one factor of many to determine this result. 
It is not improbable, however, that under certain conditions a system of county 
grading, just as a city system of grading, could be carried on successfully without 
examinations. Where, for instance, principal, teacher, and pupils are doing the best 
they can, the spur of an examination is not necesse But it is not true, in my 
opinion, that examinations are always and necessarily an evil. They have their 
proper place in the school system; not their use but their abuse is to be deplored; 
they can be made so comprehensive as to render cramming impossible; they may be 
so carefully and discreetly conducted as to reduce deception and fraud to the barest 
minimum, 
(4) Permanent and systematic records are indispensable to this system.—One of the 
most common defects to be noticed in ungraded schools is the lack of permanent 
records. The frequent change of teachers in rural schools makes them especially 
ED 93. 105 
                
 
-P-A-G-E-448
  1666 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
necessary and desirable. Without them a new teacher, usually a novice, is com- 
pelled to make a reclassification of the school. The result is a woeful loss of time, 
both for those who are imprudently set back in their studies and compelled for the 
second or third time to go over the same ground, and for those also who are quite as 
unfortunately pushed into water beyond their depth and left to flounder as best they 
may. <A properly graded system will make necessary two sets of records—one, the 
elass records of each school, showing its peculiar classification and the proficiency 
of each of its pupils; the other, the county records, which certify the results of the 
official inspection and examinations made by its superintendent. The former will 
enable a new teacher to organize her school with case and dispatch; the latter 
will enable her to compare her school with others of the same class in a town or 
county, and will serve also as a general guide for framing a suitable programme. 
Promotions, as a general rule, will be made upon the local class records; the official 
county records will enable pupils removing to other districts in the county to be 
more readily classified. 
(5) Certificates for each grade and a final diploma.—Pupils who complete any grade 
receive a certificate bearing the signature of the county superintendent, district 
clerk, principal, or teacher. Those who complete the four grades below the high 
school receive a diploma; the fifth or high school grade a special diploma. I need 
not say that these certificates are highly prized in rural districts. To the child who 
at the age of 7 or 8 years receives his first certificate it is the greatest experience 
of his life. Nor does the desire to gain these paper honors grow less until the age 
of 14 or 15, the last in the series to be secured. Some moralists will. doubtless decry 
the practice that supplies to the children and youth motives so base. But are we 
not all of us chasing madly after some supposed good, as useless and ephemeral 
when we get it as the paper on which the child’s certificate is written? It is the 
present or immediate and not the remote good that appeals to the child of interest. 
Time may come when these farmer boys will ‘‘Seek honor, e’en at the cannon’s 
mouth,” but now the height and breadth of their ambition is a roll of parchment. 
Who shall say which is the more laudable ambition, this or that? But, moralizing 
aside, the influence of the county certificate on the rural schools is an incentive to 
effort which can hardly be overestimated. 
(6) Recognition of diplomas by higher institutions.—All_ graduates of the county 
graded course are admitted to the State normal school and to many city high schools 
withoutareexamination. So, also, several colleges accept these county examinations 
in lieu of their own in the same subjects. This is an advantage not to be lightly 
estimated. 
Such, then, in brief, are the essential features of the New Jersey system of grading 
rural schools. A few words now as tothe general working of that system. It was 
devised to correct certain evils and to secure certain definite ends. It should be 
judged, therefore, by its specific results, 
The principal evils which it aimed to reach and correct are the following: 
(1) The short period of school attendance.—The entire school attendance of most 
children in the large cities does not exceed upen the average three to four years. In 
rural districts pupils attend through a longer period of years, but for fewer months 
in a year and with frequent» lapses of one or more terms. The cause of this short 
period of school attendance is not infrequently the actual need of the child’s labor 
at home; but quite as often it is due to an indifference on the part of the pupil him- 
self. The value of an education is not realized by him. The end is too remote, 
Some more immediate end, such as securing a county diploma, is a more powerful 
incentive. Take a single county. For instance, in Atlantic County, prior to the 
introduction of a graded system fifteen years ago, not one person pursued advanced 
studies where twenty or more are doing so now. So, also, of matriculants atthe nor- 
mal school and colleges; the number has increased at least twenty times in the same 
period. 
(2) Irregularity of attendance.—This is due to many causes, such as sickness, bad 
roads, need for pupils’ work at home, etc. Experience has abundantly proved, 
however, that the principal cause of irregular attendance is lack of interest on the 
part of pupils. When deeply interested in the school nothing but absolute neces- 
sity will keep them away. The county grading, with its system of examinations, 
certificates, and diplomas, furnishes the necessary incentive to keep pupils inschool. 
(3) Untrained and inexperienced teachers.—The small salaries paid in most rural dis- 
tricts compel the employment of untrained and inexperienced teachers. They need 
every help that can be devised. It is impossible for the county superintendent, 
owing to the extent of his district, to visit and advise with great frequency; hence, 
reliance must be had upon some general directions. These are furnished by the 
_ course of study and the regulations that govern it. 
(4) Frequent change of teachers. —The average term of service of the country district 
teacher is less than two years; just time enough to undo the work of a predecessor, 
and not enough to establish anew régime. . Hence, chaos is likely to prevail without 
the guidance and help afforded by some uniform system of grading. Grant that the 
     
     
-P-A-G-E-449
  NEW JERSEY. 1667 
most important need is the personal supervision of an intelligent, and enthusiastic 
superintendent. In lieu of such supervision the county graded system is a necessity ; 
with it, an additional help. 
(5) Large number of classes.—This must always be an obstacle in the way of improve- 
ment of ruralschools. It is the opposite extreme to the city system, where, by reason 
of a large number of pupils and the employment of a greater number of teachers, 
advantage can be taken of the economic principle of ‘‘ division of labor.” There is 
a@ compensation, however, even in a large number of classes; individual work, so 
rare in cities, is made obligatory. Pupils are necessarily thrown upon their own 
resources. Heuce, the two principal evils attendant upon the city system of grad- 
ing, to wit, mechanical routine and ‘‘marking time,” are less likely to arise. There 
is a happy mean to be found between too many classes and too few. The system of 
grading under discussion aims to-find it. 
(6) Lack of esprit de corps.—The preceding conditions that I have mentioned, tend, 
without some corrective, to reduce the esprit de corps of the rural schools to the 
lowest ebb. There is little in the ungraded school to fire the ambition or excite the 
love of the average boy or girl. True, history affords many examples of illustrious 
men and women who have flourished upon such a soil. But history fails to record 
the achievements of that far greater number whose buds of promise never opened in 
that ofttimes cheerless atmosphere. Next to the intelligent, enthusiastic, skillful 
teacher, the system of county grading, with its awards and diplomas, will be found 
the most effective stimulus to arouse and foster a love for school. 
In conclusion, it may be said that the conditions prevailing in rural districts are 
so unlike the conditions that prevail in cities that any a priori judgment, based on a 
knowledge merely of city needs, must be carefully scrutinized. The contention of 
Dr. Harris, that the greatest need of all schools, city or rural, is a frequent reclassifi- 
cation, in order that all pupils may at all times find their normal level in the school 
curriculum, is not traversed by this paper. On the contrary, this need of frequent 
readjustment of classes is admitted. 1 is claimed, however, that the New Jersey 
system of grading rural schools makes this frequent reclassificatiou possible, while 
affording certain additional advantages, such as comparative standard, proximate 
uniformity, and stimulus, so essential to intelligent organization, profitable instruc- 
tion, and eflective supervision.     
MANUAL TRAINING. 
Under an act of the legislature passed in 1881, and under another act passed in 
1885, the State may appropriate, in any one year, any sum not exceeding $5,000 to 
introduce and to maintain manual training in any school district of the Siate rais- 
ing by donation or taxation an equal amount. It might naturally be expected that 
so liberal a State subsidy would tend to increase rapidly the number of manual 
training schools. The fact that no large and immediate increase has taken place 
is due to the general belief that manual training is still to some extent a matter of 
experiment; that its adaptation to existing courses of study is not yet complete; 
that it is wiser to await the outcome of its trial where already introduced than to 
undertake its introduction and maintenance without sufficient knowledge. More- 
over, no effort has been made by the State department to hasten its introduc- 
tion. On the other hand, it has been thought wiser, safer, and more economical 
to strengthen the existing schools by exacting better and more extended work; to 
earry on the necessary labor of adaptation and coordination in a few schools only 
until the experimental stage is over than to encourage the broadcast introduction 
of a form of education the limitations and value of which have not yet been fully 
determined. 
Attention is called to the detailed reports of the several schools which have 
undertaken to carry on manual training, for an opinion of its merits and successful 
operation to date. 
To summarize briefly these reports, it may be said: 
(1) That without exception all the schools referred to report favorably. 
(2) That so far from abridging the time devoted to this species of instruction, all, 
without exception, are disposed to extend it. 
(3) That wherever taught by capable and competent iustructors the manual train- 
ing studies are very popular with girls and boys alike. 
As the result of my personal observation and experience I incline to the belief 
that all of the following results flow naturally from manual training when rightly 
taught: 
(1) A greater interest in school, especially on the part of ‘boys approaching the 
high-school age. The desire to do something with the hands, to engage in some 
form of labor such as they witness adults engaged in, to become men in the sense of 
being able to perform acts that look toward gaining a living; these and other con- 
siderations of a similar nature seem to give school life a more real and attractive 
character to boys at an age when book study is becoming irksome.

(2) Growing out of this changed attitude toward school life and its duties there 
arises, by operation of the law of transference of interest, a greater liking for the 
ordinary literary studies of the school. 
If this, indeed, were the only gain by incorporating manual training into the 
school curriculum it would be a sufficient consideration for the expenditure of time 
and money. 
(83) Lastly, the training acquired by a judicious course of manual instruction in 
a well-ordered school and under competent instructors is, per se, of great intrinsic 
value. 
Drawing, for instance, lies at the foundation of all the industrial arts. It is the 
prime study of the manual training school. Its admitted failure heretofore, in the 
elementary schools especially, to produce any wholesome and valuable results has 
been due largely to the abstract character of the instruction given. Taught in 
relation to and in connection with the industrial arts it becomes vivified, and affords 
to the pupil a sense of gratification while giving him a valuable knowledge and 
power. 
Iam disposed to believe that carving and wood joinery are most valuable forms 
of manual training in the upper grades of grammer schools, first, because especially 
enjoyable to the pupils, and, second, because the results obtained are exact as well 
as obvious. 
The knife and the saw, for instance, cut to an exact line. Precision as well as 
facility is acquired. Accuracy of eye and nicety of touch are cultivated. All these 
powers appeal to the self-satisfaction of the pupil; he can measure his own prog- 
ress; his ideal is attainable; he knows when he reaches it. 
The satisfaction of having made an original demonstration in geometry or a cor- 
rect translation in Latin is by no means so intense as that of having made a wooden 
box with accurate measurements and perfect joints. 
As a proof of this, observe the lad who on the same day has done both. Which 
does he exhibit to his instructor, fellow-pupils, or parents with the greatest show of 
delight? I grant that the demonstration in geometry exhibits a higher reach of 
trained faculty than is required to make a box of wood; it is not intended to dis- 
parage the demonstration; it is intended merely to call attention to the moral and 
spiritual elevation or, still better, exaltation that arises from the sense of honor- 
able achievement. 
Our schools are doing their best work when arousing such laudable feelings of a 
higher self-appraisement. Scholarship is one of the ends of the people’s schools, 
but not the only one; for usefulness in its highest sense, i. e., the ability to secure 
for one’s self and for others all that life is worth living for, falls not a whit below 
scholarship as an appropriate end for school instruction. The boy or girl imbued 
with the feeling of capacity for usefulness in the simple activities of life will be- 
come a better citizen than the boy or girl who is taught to look for honorable dis- 
tinction only in the attainment of encyclopedic book knowledge. The simple arts 
of sewing, cooking, and other handicraft are real elements of intellectual as well 
as of economic education. 
Indirectly upon the moral life they are no less valuable than direct formal instruc- 
tion in duty to one’s self and society. 
lt is my conviction, after much careful observation of the results obtained, that 
manual training is a legitimate and invaluable addition to the common school cur- 
riculum; and this on social, political, and economic grounds. ‘The individual is 
made happier; society is benefited; the State is made more secure; and the wealth 
of allis increased by shaping to some extent the instruction of the schools along 
industrial lines. 
The adaptation of manual training to the needs of pupils of the last year’s gram- 
mar and of the high school age is well advanced. What is best for pupils of a 
lesser age is not so well ascertained. 
It has been the policy of the department to discourage, for the time being, State 
appropriations to schools not having a high school department; and this for the 
reason that it is not clear as yet how manual training instruction of a sufficiently 
specific kind upon which to base an appropriation can be carried on in the lower 
grades. 
zt Applications for manual training appropriations from several large and important 
cities and school districts are pending. As soon as the wisdom of its introduction 
into the school curriculum becomes settled in the minds of the people at large, the 
rapidity of increase in number of manual training schools in the State will be great.

THE 
  ENTIAL ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION. 
The first duty of the State in educational matters seems to me to be to provide 
sound, useful instruction to all children within its borders; such instruction as will 
lay a firm, thorough foundation for any structure of education which time and 
opportunity may afterwards design. 
The majority of school children, about 90 per cent, can not enjoy the advantages 
of advanced education at the expense of the State, since nece: compels their 
parents to withdraw them from school about the time they have completed the 
study of the elementary branches. The elementary schools should therefore be the 
first and chief solicitude of the State until their needs are supplied and their effi- 
ciency in the remotest country district assured. They are conspicuously the schools 
of the people, the nurseries of future citizens. 
Iam compelled to dwell particularly on this subject, as it is a regretable fact that 
teachers and pupils in many instances have shown indifference toward the study of 
the fundamental branches and unreflecting eagerness to reach the higher studies 
without due preliminary steps. 
It is a serious mistake to regard elementary classes in a school as unworthy of the 
zealous care of any teacher and the unstinted encouragement of any school board. 
It is to the thousands of children whose education is necessarily limited to the ele- 
imentary classes that the State must look in the near future for the mass of its citi- 
zens; not to the comparative few who are enabled by more fortunate surroundings 
to graduate from high schools, academies, and colleges. 
To attain success in the public schools and to expend to the best advantage the 
liberal appropriations made by the State for education it appears to me that there 
is one only practical course, and that is thoroughness in every branch of instruction. 
The tendency in many schools is, unfortunately, to attempt too much, without a 
thought as to doing the most necessary part of the work well. It is chargeable to 
the misdirected ambition of parents as much, if not more, than to the teacher. 
When the programme of studies is increased so as to produce mental congestion, 
the main object of public instruction is lost. To do a few things in school, and to 
do them well, is preferable to cramming the tender mind with odds and ends of a 
multitude of subjects—the merest superficial knowledge, which can never be made 
practical. But itis unhappily the case that parents too frequently lose sight of this 
vital principle of education, and are prone to insist upon their children being pushed 
forward into higher studies before they are well grounded in the essential branches. 
They take pride in repeating the names of the various studies with which their 
children are vainly laboring, and disregard the necessity of obtaining a thorough 
knowledge of the elementary branches which must be biought into the walks of 
ordinary business life. 
          
     
   
-P-A-G-E-452
1670 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  The teachers, realizing that their efforts for the concentration of energy upon a 
few requisite subjects do not meet with proper appreciation, are tempted to abandon 
the true path of thoroughness in elementary instruction by gratifying the unreflect- 
ing vanity of parents and loading their pupils with burdens both grievous and use- 
less. The children are taught to regard elementary studies as beneath their notice, 
and with the merest smattering of the most essential branches they are rushed into 
higher readers, geometry, algebra, and other studies. Far better for them that they 
should be taught to read, spell, write, and cipher well, than to be subjected to such 
a force-pump process in higher studies without having firm ground under them for 
such education as will be of most service to them in the ordinary occupations of life. 
The result is apparent in many instances of pupils forced into the most ambitious 
studies, and yet woefully deficient in spelling, and fair, legible penmanship. Wehave 
students in grammar schools in scientific branches who can not add up a simple 
column of figures without making inexcusable blunders, and who can not write a 
simple business letter without perpetrating gross ungrammatical solecisms, In 
attempting to do too much we accomplish but little. Bread-winning knowledge is 
ignored in the attempt to grasp everything. The promise of the common schools is to 
give a sound education in the most necessary branches. 
There is not the slightest argument in favor of making them all-embracing colleges. 
The State should not, under any circumstances, hold out any encouragement to the 
multiplication of unnecessary studies by ofiering a premium or money inducement 
to forsake the safe, true course of instruction. Cramming for examinations which 
hold out such inducements is an evil to be deplored, and it can not fail in the end to 
injure materially the prospects of the common schools. 
‘The vast field of human knowledge can not be‘adequately gleaned in the few years 
in which a child can attend school. When the pupil is hurried from one topic to 
another there can not be any thorough education. The mind, like the body, requires 
time to digest its food. : 
A methodless thinker, a pupil, a parrot repeating set lessons without understand- 
ing them, a reflector of indistinct impressions, can not be considered as good a scholar 
as one who has been benefited by the liberality of the State in public instruction. 
As an eminent educator has said, ‘‘The mind must be fed, judiciously fed, not gorged.” 
Tho first object of a teacher should be to develop the mental faculties of his or her 
pupils by making them think, The mind can not be awakened er developed other- 
wise. The number of books which a boy or girl carries to school is no criterion of 
advancement. The most ignorant person, endowed with wealth, can have a large 
library, which might as well be at the bookseller’s asin his house. Fewer books and 
more knowledge of what they contain may be relied upon to produce more practical 
educational effect. 
A few clear thoughts, adaptable at any moment and fully presenting a subject, are 
preferable to a mass of mere words, even if they are supposed to represent higher 
education. To think well and intelligently on one question, by having acquired 
the habit of thoroughness in study, is of more use in practical life than to have com- 
mitted to memory the ideas of others on a score of different things and not be able 
to apply them. 
The thorough mastery of a single educational subject, no matter how humble it 
may be, is the best of introductions to all other questions. It is the best training of 
d,   
    
  
  
            the mind, for it develops the essential faculty of getting to the bottom facts in 
investigating things, ‘The superficial thinker or observer is the one who does not 
succeed in life. 
Education, so far as its effects upon the well-being of the State are concerned, 
should be practical and general. It should include the entire mass of the people, 
not solely or particularly a few favored by fortune. It should aim at the thorough 
instruction of the many, not the special aggrandizement of the few. The university 
and the college accommodate but a very small proportion of those who go to school— 
much less than 1 per cent. They are separate and apart from any general practical 
system of public instruction. Public funds intended for general educational pur- 
poses should be primarily devoted to the elementary schools. The people require ele- 
mentary education before that which is the province of what are known as the higher 
institutions. They want their children to read, write, spell, and cipher correctly 
before they seek diplomas and academic honors. They are more interested in their 
children being well prepared for the duties of life by a solid ground work of public 
instruction than in wasting their time over a multitude of studies of an advanced 
kind, which can not, in a period allotted them for school, be learned with any degree 
of proficiency. 
Potential knowledge consists in knowing a few things well, and not a large num- 
ber of subjects badly. It includes in its broad scope self-reliance, without which 
education is of little practical utility. 
Strength and vigor of mind are depreciated, if not nullified, by any system of 
public instruction which causes the pupil to rely entirely upon the arm of another. 
Such a system is that which looks only to the superstructure of public instruction, 
to the neglect of the foundation.

GRADUATION FROM THE DISTRICT SCHOOLS. 
The number of examinations under the ‘“ Boxwell” law, providing for graduation 
from the schools of the subdistricts and special districts, shows a marked increase 
over 1892, when the first examination under the law took place. 
There can be no doubt that this lawis having a great eftect for good upon the sub- 
district schools. A careful examination of the. following table will furnish abun- 
dant evidence of its rapidly increasing usefulness and popularity:

  UNIFORM EXAMINATION QUESTIONS—SOME OBJECTIONS STATED. 
The law providing for uniform questions for teachers’ examinations could not be 
executed through failure of the legislature to make any appropriation to meet the 
necessary expense for printing, ete. 
The chief reason given for the passage of this law is that in some instances the 
questions asked by county examiners are of such a narrow, technical character that 
they can not possibly determine, to any extent, the applicant’s knowledge or fitness 
for teaching, and therefore the questions should be prepared by State authority, and 
thus made uniform. 
To anyone who wil: give this subject of uniform examinations careful thought 
some serious difficulties will present themselves. It is true that in several States 
uniform questions are used with a reasonable degree of satisfaction, but it is also 
true, as a rule, that in these States the laws have been such in the past as to cause 
more uniformity in the educational system of the State than is found in Ohio; at 
least it is true that in our State there isa vast difference in the educational standards 
of the different counties. In some counties the standard of examination is so high 
that only those who have thoroughly prepared themselves for the work of teaching 
can hope to receive certificates; many of these counties are, comparatively speak- 
ing, wealthy, and can well afford to pay first-class salaries to first-class teachers for 
a term of nine or ten months each year. As a result of this condition of affairs, it is 
very necessary that the questions used by the examiners in these counties shall be of 
such a nature as to insure the maintenance of this high educational standard. 
In other counties, opposite conditions prevail; the educational standard is low; 
the tax duplicate small; and everytbing seems to favor low salaries, and as shoré 
terms of school as the law will permit. It will be readily seen that questions adapted 
to the conditions existing in the counties first mentioned will not be suitable at all 
for other counties with different existing conditions. 
Then, all who have given any study to the examination problem will admit that 
the grading of the answers to the questions is one of the most important elements 
entering into the success or failure of the examination. So far as this work is con- 
cerned, uniform questions farnish no relief. It is difficult to nnderstand how 
examiners who are charged with being too incompetent and narrow-minded to ask 
reasonable questions, can be expected to grade intelligently and broadly answers to 
questions asked by someone else. 
Although it will be readily admitted by everyone that some very incompetent per- 
sons can be found serving as county examiners, yet it is seriously doubted by many 
whether uniform questions will remedy to any extent this serious evil.

PERMANENT CERTIFICATES TO COLLEGE GRADUATES. 
The law requiring the issue of permanent certificates to college graduates brought 
to light a state of things truly astonishing. Under the corporation act of 1874 the 
county courts have been incorporating business colleges, schools of elocution, and 
other institutions of learning. 
 
-P-A-G-E-454
1672 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. ; 
Some of these schools have, upon the basis of such charters, been conferring 
degrees upon students and others of very limited attainments. A lady, for instance, 
received the degree of B. A., who had read but five books of Cesar, four books of 
Virgil, and four orations of Cicero. Arithmetic and penmanship were reported as 
part of her four collegiate years of study. A letter sent to the department by the 
head of the institution abbreviates et cetera several times by the use of ‘‘ect.” 
instead of etc., and has pedagogical spelled ‘:pedagochical,” not to mention other 
blemishes, indicative of what Ben Johnson calls ‘‘small Latin and less Greek.” 
Another institution was leased with its charter, and, although it is said to have less 
than a dozen students, and a faculty composed of the president and his wife, it has 
been conferring degrees from B. A. to LL. D. upon persons who are vain and weak 
enough to wear titles emanating from such sources. The institution even went so 
far as to confer a doctorate on its own president. Why shouid not the wife confer 
a degree upon her husband, and the husband upon his wife, when a state of things 
is threatened similar to that which was threatened in France, when a minister 
declared that he would create so many dukes that henceforth it should be no honor 
to be a duke, but a disgrace not to be a duke, At the present rate there is danger 
that literary degrees conferred in Pennsylvania shall become the laughing stock of 
the civilized world. 
Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that superintendents and institu- 
tions of high grade, whose aim is to do honest and thorough work, entered thei 
protest against the issue of permanent certificates to the graduates of such institu- 
tions, under the act of May 10, 1893. 
The act was, therefore, referred to the attorney-general for his construction and 
advice. In an official opinion, dated October 17, 1893, he says that the State super- 
intendent is ‘‘not required to grant, without examination, permanent certificates 
under the act of 1893, except to graduates of colleges ‘legally empowered’ to confer 
degrees, and that the general incorporation of a literary institution, under the act 
of 1874, does not ‘legally empower’ it with this right.” 
The only course open to the department, therefore, is to require, as conditions for 
issuing the permanent certificate, the following: 
(1) The applicant must furnish evidence of a good moral character. 
(2) The applicant must be twenty-one years of age, and must have taught at 
least three full annual terms in the public schools of the Commonwealth, after grad- 
uation. 
(3) The applicant must produce a certificate from the school board or boards, 
countersigned by the county superintendent of the same county where he or she last 
taught, showing that the said applicant has been successful as a teacher in the 
public schools during said term. 
(4) His or her course of study, leading to the degree of bachelor of arts (B. A.), 
master of arts (M. A.), bachelor of science (B. S.), master of science (M.S.), bachelor 
of philosophy (Ph. B.), must have embraced four collegiate years of study, exclu- 
sive of the preparatory work required by our respectable colleges for admission into 
the freshman class. 
(5) The college or university granting the diploma must have been invested with 
power to confer degrees by an act of the legislature.   
  
   
    
   
    GRADUATION IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
In close connection with the abuse of literary degrees, is the kindred tendency to 
graduate pupils upon the completion of all sorts of courses, and to give them diplo- 
mas in recognition thereof, A bureau has even been organized to furnish questions to 
school officers, and to bestow certificates that look like diplomas upon those who 
are willing to pay the fees and to take the examination. The temptation for teachers 
and superintendents to adopt expedients of this kind lies in the fact thata diploma 
has its chief value for the undergraduate. _Itsets up a goal upon which he may fix his 
eye, toward which he may work with unflinching perseverance, and for the attain- 
ment of which he may be willing to remain at school a year or two longer. But, after 
it ceases to exert its influence as a motive to sustained effort, it is apt to prove a 
snare and a curse. It often leads the so-called graduate and his parents to believe 
that his education is complete, and thus puts an end to all further growth and 
study. Graduating exercises in the grammar grade may cause a pupil to be satis- 
fied with that course, who might, otherwise, aspire to go through the high school 
and the college. In like manner, the high school and the college may aspire to be 
finishing schools, instead of pointing the brightest minds to: subsequent courses of 
study and reading. In fact, it may be laid down as a universal proposition, that any 
institution whose teaching fails to inspire a thirst for further educational advan- 
tages, is a dismal failure, and sadly needs a thorough reorganization, as well as the 
infusion of a different spirit.

FREE TEXT-BOOKS. 
In 1892 the number of schools in which text-books were supplied free of cost to 
the pupils was 2,481. The act of May 18, 1893, makes it obligatory upon school 
directors and controllers to purchase, out of the school fund of the district, the text- 
books and other school supplies needed, in addition to those at present in use in the 
hands of the pupils, or owned by the district. No legislation has, for years, so thor- 
oughly shaken up the entire school system. The competition between the book 
firms proved a severe test for the integrity of their agents and the directors with 
whom they were dealing. To their praise, be it said, no scandals or crooked deal- 
ings have come to the notice of the department; but, after the orders were placed, 
many of the publishers could not furnish the books rapidly enough, hence many of 
the schools were somewhat embarrassed at the opening of the current school year. , 
‘The beneficent results of the free text-book act are visible in many of the larger 
towns and cities. So far as has been ascertained, at the present writing, the 
attendance has greatly increased, especially in the upper grades. The children will 
no longer be kept from studying certain branches through a lack of the necessary 
books; nor will the boys be kept out of school as they reach the advanced grades, 
because the parents are unable to purchase the text-books. The care of the books 
will inspire respect for public property, while the danger of infection, which some 
feared from soiled books, has been largely overcome by the use of paper covers, 
which can be cast aside and replaced by a fresh cover when a book passes into new 
hands, The system has not failed, except in schools whose teachers lack discip- 
linary power. 
THE FIVE MILLIONS. 
The effect of increasing the annual appropriation to five millions is seen in an 
increase of teachers’ salaries, in the lengthening of the school term, and in the erec- 
tion of better schoolhouses. Marked progress has been made in the erection of 
school buildings, and in the purchase of libraries and apparatus. Everywhere the 
idea is gaining ground that the school should be made as pleasant and attractive as 
thehome. The methods of lighting, heating, and ventilating are studied by experts, 
and the competition between rival companies stimulates men to put their talent and 
genius into this branch of the work. American school fnrniture has been vastly 
improved, and is now the admiration of the civilized world. Nevertheless, school 
diseases, such as myopia and the overwrought condition of the nervous system, 
sometimes named ‘Americanitis,” are on the increase, and deserve careful study. 
This has led to the shortening of the school day to five hours in the graded schools 
of some cities. Nor can the increased appropriation be said to have produced the 
effects which ardent friends of the public schools had expected. _ Reference to the 
statistical tables shows that the resulting increase in the monthly salary of male 
teachers was but $1.79, and in that of female teachers only $1.63. The average 
increase in the length of the school term was but one-third of a month. The total 
increase in the cost of tuition was $701,779.83, and the decrease in the amount of 
tax levied for school purposes was $321,795.95. Add to these amounts the increase 
in the cost of building, purchasing, and renting ($777,591.73), and the increase in 
the cost of fuel, contingencies, debts, and interest paid ($1,072,277.37), and there 
remains a balance unaccounted for in the three million increase of the annual appro- 
priation amounting to $126,569.12, which must have accumulated in the treasuries 
of some of the districts instead of being expended upon the improvement of the 
schools. Unfortunately, the spirit of progress has not permeated all parts of the 
Commonwealth. In too many districts the directors have yielded to the temptation 
to reduce the tax rate to less than a mill, and to run the schools on a cheap plan, by 
hiring cheap teachers. The statistics on this point are startling, indeed. The total 
number of college graduates employed in the public schools is 284. The graduates 
of State normal schools, academies, aud seminaries, who teach in the public schools 
is 7,064. Hence, 17,991 teachers have never enjoyed the advantage of a full course 
of study beyond the public schools. Some of these, by private study and by par- 
tial courses at normal and other schools, have risen to the rank of those holding 
professional and permanent certificates; but the startling fact remains. that over 
half of the teachers of Pennsylvania (12,975) hold the provisional certificate, and 
almost a myriad of them (8,979) never had any training outside of the common 
schools. 
The provisional certificate carries on its face the evidence that the holder’s quali- 
fications are not up to the standard in all the branches to be taught, and especially 
not in the theory and practice of teaching. Nor can it be expected that poor human 
nature shall exemplify all the virtues of the educational decalogue at salaries rang- 
ing from $12 to $25 per month. Some future historian will record it as the marvel 
of the ages that, in the closing decade of the nineteenth century, many parents 
were willing, in the rich Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to intrust the education

  of their children into the hands of persons whose services were not considered worth 
the wages of a common day laborer. Indeed, one is sometimes tempted to ask: Do 
the schools exist for the benefit of the children, or do children come into being that 
there may be schools and school directors, and employment for teachers? If the 
later alternative be accepted, it may be right to appoint the daughter of a citizen 
for the reason that he is a taxpayer, or cripple becausé he hasno other means of 
earning a livelihood, or a fellow who gets periodically intoxicated because, in this 
way, his relatives can most easily help him and his to bread; but, if the school 
exists for the child, then teachers ought to be employed and retained solely upon 
the basis of merit; that is, upon the basis of fitness for, and skill in, the art of 
instracting and training the young; and all other interests should be subordi- 
nated to the interests of the children, for whose sake schools are established and 
maintained.   
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The high school course in Pennsylvania is like the letter x in algebra—an unknown 
quantity, whose value must, in each case, be found in order to be known. Some cities 
and boroughs strive, with commendable zeal, to realize the true ideal of ahigh school, 
viz: A fitting school for those who wish to enter a higher institution, and a finishing 
school for those who must begin the struggle for bread. Some high schools neglect 
preparatory studies, but aim to teach branches which are better taught in the col~ 
leges, by reason of superior equipment and endowed professorships; and at the end 
of a three or four years’ course their graduates are mortified to find that they can not 
enter a respectable college anywhere. Other high schools have courses that were 
evidently arranged by persons not familiar with all grades of school work. Occa- 
sionally, one finds a curriculum so ill fitting and illogical, that it must have been 
shaped to meet the limit qualifications of some ambitious teacher, whose friends 
needed a pretext to give him the salary of a high school principal. At no distant 
day, a conference of representatives of our best colleges and secondary schools should 
agree upon a minimum high school curriculum, leaving room, of course, for lecal 
needs and future developments. The legislature could then follow the example of 
other States in setting apart a share of the annual appropriation for the purpose of 
fostering and strengthening the high schools which come up to the proposed standard. 
  THE MASSES. 
  The great majority of the pupils never reach the secondary schools, still less the 
colleges and the universities. The education which they receive should fit them to 
make the most of the life which is before them. It should conduce to their happiness, 
as wellasto their material prosperity. The bearing of reading, writing, and ciphering 
upon business and social life is well known. The duty of the schools to increase the 
sources of happiness, by developing a taste for good literature. is not so well under- 
stood. Teach a man toread, and you widen his horizon and his aspirations. He sees 
new phases of life, and longs to realize them for himself and his family. If his reading 
fixes his eye upon luxuries which can not be purchased with his earnings, he will grow 
dissatisfied, and the discontent may ripen into strikes and mob violence. The ability 
to read, instead of producing this result, should increase the sum of human happiness 
by multiplying the possible sources of enjoyment. The application of steam to the 
printing press has brought the great dailies within the reach of everybody's purse 
and has cheapened the works of standard authors to such an extent that a choice col- 
lection of classic authors is possible in every home, He who reads may associate 
with men of wit and genius, when these are at their best, and may choose his com- 
pany from the authors of every age and clime. Here the rich man has no vantage 
ground over the tiller of the soil or the toiler with the hand. More expensive bind- 
ing the former may have; of the real essence of the book, he can enjoy no more than 
any other intelligent reader. Indeed, in one respect, the man who eats his bread in 
the sweat of his brow has the advantage over those engaged in a profession. The 
lawyer, the physician, the clergyman exhaust their mental energy in pro: 
duties; when evening comes they must seek rest and recreation in physical 
in a change of occupation. The laborer, on the other hand, can find rest and an 
agreeable change at the close of the day in literary pursuits, in the study of art or 
some branch of science. While our colleges are training a generation that grows 
wild with delight over football and other athletic sports—that too often talks and 
thinks of nothing except the heroes and the vicissitudes of the last game—the public 
schools, by their improved methods of teaching reading, are striving to educate a 
younger generation of boys and girls, whose taste for good literature and knowledge 
of good books will bring the future toilers of the land to the front in point of culture, 
and yield them sources of enjoyment more enduring than the luxuries by which the 
idle rich now seek to dispel their ennui.

[From report of State board of education, 1892-93.] 
  MANUAL TRAINING AND DRAWING. 
Two events have occurred during the year of special significance to the work of. 
education in this State—the completion of the manual training high school by the 
city of Providence, and the erection of a building for the Rhode Island School of 
Design. These two institutions stand henceforth for a decided advance in the line 
of true industrial education and development. This State has been unduly slow to 
move along these new lines of educational growth, and some of our sister Common- 
wealths have obtained quite a start in the race for honors along this line. 
But with these two institutions in Providence, another of similar character to the 
manual training school now in process of erection in the city of Newport, and 
the prospect of similar facilities in other sections of the State, there seems to be no 
reason why we should not now enter upon a new career of progress. When art and 
skill join hands under tho guidance of & definite purpose, there is nothing unattain- 
able within the limits of human effort. Let the study of drawing be taught in 
every grade of our schools, from the lowest primary up to the high school, so that 
every child shall always have at his command the two modes of expression for his 
ideas—words and pictures; let his eye and hand be thus trained to work for each 
other; and also let the ordinary curriculum of the schools be supplemented by such 
means as shall suggest to the pupil that school life is but the preparation for, the 
open door to, the real life of the world, and a new atmosphere will be created in our 
schoolrooms, and an impulse will be given to every form of industrial etiort m the 
State. Boys and girls will go out of school into the shop with detinite purposes 
already formed, with both taste and capacity for original work. 
At whatever stage in his education the child may leave school, he witl have 
acquired some skill with the hand, ideas of an entirely new nature will have been 
made familiar to him, and they must influence his whole after life, both his thoughts 
and his actions. But if he can stay on through the various grades, and finally com- 
plete his purely intellectual training in such a school as these new manual training 
schools, if he has any natural aptitude for these things, he must become thoroughly | 
alive to their every detail and grow to a thorough mastery of them. If to this 
preparation he can add the benefits conferred by the school of design he can not help 
becoming a master workman—than whom there is no one more honorable. Here is, 
indeed, a field of labor most inviting, and as yet but little occupied. Shall we not 
euter in and possess it? 
RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN. 
The annual report from the board of management of the school of design shows 
an increasing field of activity and usefulness, and commends the school more and 
more to the fostering care of the State. 
Within the year the school has been presented with a beautiful building on Water- 
man street, between North Main and Benefit streets, through the liberality of one 
of the citizens of Providence, a leading manufacturer of the State. Through the 
enlargement of its facilities the school will be able to do far better work than ever 
before, and also to accommodate much larger numbers. 
Already the funds provided for State scholarships have proved wholly inadequate 
. to meet the demand, and there is no doubt but that a much larger sum could be 
readily and wisely employed for this purpose. One hundred and twenty-three 
scholarships have been given out—20 for the day classes, 5 for the Saturday class, 
and the remainder for the evening classes, The applicants for these scholarships, 
for the most part, come directly from the factories and shops of Providence and 
vicinity, and they realize their need of just sucn training that they may be succes 
ful in their several lines of labor. There can be no doubt but that every dollar 
invested by the State in this way will pay a large interest in the added skill and 
productive power of the pupils. Some addition should certainly be made to the fund 
for scholarships unless we propose to put a decided check upon a movement among 
the younger wage earners of our community, which we have labored earnestly to 
arouse and which we believe is fraught with great Lenefits to the State if properly 
trained and developed. 
          
FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 
Forty-two libraries are now receiving State aid annually. As a whole there is not 
much change in the condition of affairs from that of last year. Slight fluctuations 
in the circulation up and down are to be noticed, but no marked change which 
demands special attention.  
-P-A-G-E-458
  1676 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Ina very few libraries, however, there have been improvements in circulation which 
call for a word. These are in the direction of a general increase in circulation, and 
especially an increase in the proportion of good literature read. In every instance 
these results have come about, not by chance, but through the wise, intelligent 
efforts of the librarian, who considered it her task not merely to hand out what wsa 
called for, but to so guide and direct that she should really determine what should 
be called for. 
There is not much use in piling up great masses of books unless it is proposed to 
place some one in charge of them who shall know how to make all of their hidden 
treasures available to the average man and woman, boy and girl. These persons are 
lost in such a place and need a pilot to steer them through its unknown waters. But 
in too many cases the librarian knows but little more than the visitor, and it becomes 
a case of the blind leading the blind. 
The permanent librarian, trained for his duties, or constantly studying to perfect 
himself therein, is the great need of the free public library. Who will champion the 
cause of the librarian as, next to the teacher, the most important servant of the 
people, and hence as worthy of his hire, so that for all of these two score we may 
soon have competent librarians in charge, and the treasures of the libraries brought 
clearly before the eager gaze of the people? We fully believe, if this arrangement 
could be made, that our public libraries would take on a new lease of life, and that 
they would soon sink their roots down so deep into the life of the State that they 
would draw as unfailing a supply of nourishment as do the public schools, 
[From report of Hon. Thomas B. Stockwell, State school commissioner.] 
GAIN IN COLLEGE-EDUCATED TEACHERS. 
In the education of the teachers there has been quite a gain in those who are 
college educated. This is partly due to the fact that more and more women with 
college education are entering into our schools. Already the supply of college- 
educated women is in excess of the available places in the high schools, and I look 
before long to see the upper rooms in our grammar schools occupied by college 
graduates. The more general diffusion of college training will inevitably lead to its 
laying hold upon a wider range of occupations and positions. The most significant 
features in the report upon the education of the teachers are the marked falling off 
in those reported as from high schools, and the more than twice as large increase in 
the number from normal schools, This shows that mere knowledge is not considered, 
so much as heretofore, a sufficient qualification for becoming a teacher, but that some 
special training for the work is required. In this connection I am glad to recognize 
the contributions made to our teaching corps the past year by normal schools outside 
of our own State, notably by the Bridgewater, Mass., school, in supplying men for 
grammar school positions. The demand for this class of persons in this State is 
so limited that practically men have been driven out of the business, so that for two 
years or more we have not had in our normal school a single man engaged in the 
work of preparation for teaching. 
METHODS OF INSTRUCTION. 
Within a few years quite a fundamental change has taken place in the methods 
of instruction in many branches. What is now known as the lo uboratory method of - 
study has quite largely supplanted the text-book method of former years. This is 
specially true of the natural sciences, but has worked its way into such studies even 
as history, literature, mathematics. The fundamental principle is that of individual 
work by the pupil with original materials. 
While there have undoubtedly been some, perhaps many, excesses in the manner 
in which this new method has been pushed, there is as truly much of good in it. 
For the stronger student it is by far the better course to pursue, and even for the- 
average pupil its advantages outweigh its weaknesses. It brings the student into 
much closer touch with the real subject of study; he sees it with his own eyes, 
instead of through those of the writer of the book; and the reality of the truth, 
whatever its nature may be, appeals to him as it can not possibly do through the 
pages of a book. 
These changed conditions in the actual work of the schoolroom call for a class of. 
teachers of a different character from those who have heretofore been selected. 
Book knowledge alone is not the main test; there must be an acquaintance to some 
extent with the sources whence the book knowledge has been derived. The teacher 
must be able to guide the pupils along the path by which they are to gain for them- 
selves and by themselves the 8 whose acquisition is thought to be desirable. 
To this end it will be necessary to modify very materially our methods of prepar- 
ing teachers for their work. For those who are to enter the profession hereafter 
the normal schools and colleges with their enlarged resources and improved equip-

ments will afford adequate facilities. But what is to be done for those already in 
the schools, who have never had these opportunities? 
’ The teachers’ institute has for many years been recognized asa most valuable 
factor in the work of improving the qualifications of the teachers, and it has wrought 
a most excellent work. The time has now come wher it must be enlarged into 
something more than a transient gathering of teachers for the illustration of some 
new method, the enforcing of some new principle, or the emphasizing of some old 
truth. The demand of the times is that it shall furnish some systematic and_con- 
nected series of instruction in certain subjects, so that teachers who now know little 
or nothing of these topics may be to some extent qualified to teach them; or in case 
ot subjects heretofore familiar may be drilled in the new and better way of present- 
ing them. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
[From report of State Supt. W. D. Mayfield, 1893.] 
    MORE MONEY NEEDED.   
The expense of operating the public schools has increased year by year with the 
increased attendance, while the increase in the amount of money devoted to public 
education has been but slight, the most of this increase coming from special taxes 
raised in towns and cities having graded school systems. 
The schools in the towns and cities, in the main, are supplying the needs of the 
people. This is true because the people have voted an additional tax for the pur- 
pose of operating them. Asa rule, such is not the case with the country schools, a 
few of them only having the benefit of an extra tax. These schools are inadequate, 
many of them inferior, some of them almost worthless, and it is impossible to 
improve them to any appreciable extent without more money. It is needless to try 
to shut our eyes to this fact. All efforts of school officers to improve them must core 
tinue to be fruitless without more money. There is, perhaps, nothing in the State 
to be more regretted than the insufficiency of the country schools. The money spent 
annually in the maintenance of these schools is proportionately small. The amount 
<loes not exceed two and a half dollars for each pupil in attendance on them, includ- 
ing the graded schools of the State. The graded schools run about nine months in 
the year, while the country schools will not average more than three. This is a 
burning shame and a cruel wrong to the boys and girls of the State who live in the 
country and are limited principally to the country schools for their education. The 
Jegislature has always been liberal in supporting State institutions for higher learn 
ing; and I trust I may be excused for calling your attention to the fact, without 
intending to injure these institutions, that there is spent annually in the support of 
the four State institutions for higher ‘learning of whites, which have not an aggre- 
gate of seven hundred pupils, an amount in the neighborhood of one-half as much 
as is spent on the education of ninety-odd thousand white children who attend the 
public schools of the State. 
The above facts should appeal to every lover of education, which each of you is 
supposed to be, with such force as to demand provision for an increase in the public 
school fund. There are now but three ways provided by law for the raising of 
money for the public schools. One is by a tax on each poll, which is limited by the 
constitution of the State to $1 percapita. The statutory law of the State now fixes 
the liability to this tax on all able-bodied male citizens between the ages of 21 and 
50 years. The only way by which an increase from this source can ‘be had is to 
extend the age to its liability, which should be done. Another is the constitutional 
tax on property, which can not be less than 2 mills on the dollar and can not be 
more except by your permission. It is advisable that you empower the county com- 
missioners to levy more than two mills on property, the question having been first 
submitted to a vote of the qualified electors of a county before the 1st day of April 
in ach year. The third is by what is known as the ‘act of 1888,” which provides 
for the levying of a special tax on property. This act contains so many require- 
ments which have to be repeated each year that it is practically inoperative. It 
should be simplified so as to render it easy of execution, and allow a tax when once 
voted to continue from year to year until the people decide by vote to discontinue 
it. This is the preferred way through which to increase the fund, provided the law 
be simplified and the work allowed to stand, when once done, until the people say 
they want it no longer.   
   
   
    PRIVATE COLLEGES. 
Information received shows that the private colleges in the State, male and female, 
have begun the new year most auspiciously. Fears existed that the financial depres- 
sion, and the losses occasioned by recent severe storms, would operate against them. 
   
-P-A-G-E-460
1678 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Their openings, however, show this not to have been the case, many of them having 
more pupils than ever before, and the prospects of all seem to be good. In fact, a 
new female college (Chicora), under the auspices of the Presbyterian denom.ination, 
has been established in the city of Greenville during the summer. The people of 
the entire State feel a just pride in these institutions, and it is gratifying to note 
that they are meeting with merited success, Considering the size and population of 
our State, there are few, if any, States in the Union which surpass us in the number 
and character of our colleges. We have for the education of white males three 
institutions supported by the State—the South Carolina College, South Carolina 
Military Academy, and Clemson Agricultural and Mechanical College; and several 
institutions supported by private means—Wofford College, Furman University, 
Patrick’s Military Institute, Erskine College, Newberry College, Charleston College, 
and Porter Academy. For the education of white females we have one State institu- 
tion—the South Carolina Industrial and Winthrop Normal College; and supported by 
private means is Converse College, Greenville Female College, Chicora Female Col- 
lege, Williamston Female College, Due West Female College, Columbia Female 
College, South Carolina College for Women, Sumter Institute, Limestone Institute, 
Charleston Female Seminary, and Union Seminary. 
SOUTH CAROLINA COLLEGE. 
Your attention is called to the special report of the president of the South Carolina 
College to this department given in this report. 
The college buildings have been thoroughly repaired and repainted. They are in 
better condition now than they have been in many years. The work done on them 
has b substantial and will last for years tocome. The grounds have been put in 
thorough order, and really the campus ‘is a thing of beauty.” 
You can judge the future prospects of this college as well asI can. The number 
of pupils in attendance on it last year was small, and this year it is smaller, if Iam 
correctly informed. The faculty strong and able, and the work done is above 
criticism. In fact there is nothing lacking to make it a first-class college except 
students. 
The State has made no provision for normal instruction for males. There is suffi- 
cient room here to accommodate such as desire to take the regular college course, 
judging from present prospects, and still leave room enough for a normai college for 
males, This is advisable if the college is to be filled. Something should be done to 
brirg it pupils to justify its continuation at so great a cost to the State. 
Spartanburg County had this year 13,479 pupils in attendance on her public schools, 
and spent on their education much less money than was spent on the education of 
the few pupils who attended this college during the year. <A normal college for 
males, with scholarships, would greatly increase the attendance. With the same 
amount now appropriated to the college a normal college could be organized and 
operated with quite a number of such scholarships.

  ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY. 
On the 5th of June, 1893, the board of trustees of the State University adopted 
the following declaration and regulations: 
“The University of Tennessee declares its intention hereafter to‘admit women of 
the full age of 17 years to all the benefits and privileges of this institution; but for 
their safety and proper protection they will be subject to the following regulations, 
viz: 
““(1) They will have no dormitory or domicile on the university grounds, except 
in the families of the faculty. 
“(2) They will not beard or lodge in any family in which male students board or 
lodge at the same time, and then only in families approved in writing by the faculty, 
or their own parents or legal guardians. 
“¢(3) The sum of $300 is hereby appropriated for repairs and improvements upon 
the Janney Building, on the university grounds, which is set apart temporarily for 
their use as reception rooms whilst awaiting their recitations. 
“(4) The faculty is charged with the utmost diligence in the observance of these 
regulations, and such others as ‘may be adopted by them, under the supervision of 
the hoard; and those who accept the benefits of this school thereby pledge them- 
selves to dutiful acquiescence in the same.” 
This action was promptly published to the people of the State, and all the exam- 
iners and accredited schools were duly notified. The result was that 48 young 
women were admitted in the regular way to the departments at Knoxville. 
   
-P-A-G-E-461
  TENNESSEE. 1679 
The young women who have entered are well prepared and are doing admirable 
work. They were admitted on the same terms precisely as men—that is, upon exami- 
nation, high-school certificates, or certificates from other reputable colleges and 
seminaries. They were all carefully examined, as the men are, with regard to their 
past school record and purposes in going to college, and only those who were thought 
to be well prepared, and were supposed to have the proper age, were admitted. 
The women take one of the regular courses hitherto provided for men. Not a 
single class was changed, nor a new one started, for their special benefit. They 
wanted the benefit of the facilities for higher education and scientific training pre- 
viously provided at the university, and we simply admitted them to what we had. 
They are required to take a full quota of work (fifteen hours a week), unless 
physically disqualified or especially exempted by the faculty, and all women want- 
ing only special classes, like literature, French, ete., were thus excluded. The 
university offers as yet no instruction in music, art (other than free-hand and indus- 
trial drawing), or any of the other so-called ‘“‘accomplishments.” Two competent 
persons were licensed to teach music at the uniy ty privately and outside of class 
hours; but the institution has nothing further to do with this instruction, and it 
has not affected the situation one way or the other. Everything was thus done to 
discourage that class of young women who merely wanted to be polished or “ fin- 
ished,” from entering the institution; but everything reasonable was done: to 
encourage women who wanted a thorough, liberal education, training in some spe- 
cialty, or education for some profession. The majority of the women are seeking a 
liberal education or training in some specialty, either literary or scientific. Some 
are preparing themselves thoroughly for the profession of the teacher. 
FREE TUITION FOR STUDENTS. 
  The board of trustees have also passed the following resolutions relating to the 
free admission of students: 
“ Be it resolved by the board of trustees of the University of Tennessee, That all students 
who shall have completed the prescribed course of study in any State secondary 
school, town or city high school, high school department, private school, academy 
or college in this State, whose course of study shall have been approved by the 
president and faculty of the university, as provided in the regulations for accredited 
schools, shall be admitted, upon a certificate or diploma from the said school, to 
the lowest class of the said college, and receive free tuition. 
“2, That it shall be the duty of the faculty of the university, during the months 
of May, June, July, or August, of each year, to hold, or cause to be held at con- 
venient points throughout the State, examinations, for the purpose of giving oppor- 
tunity to such persons as are not provided for in the foregoing paragraph to become 
students, with free tuition, in the university.”

VIRGINIA. 
RICHMOND COLLEGE, RICHMOND, VA. 
By C. H. Ryanp, D. D., Secretary. 
Richmond College belongs to that great family of American schools for higher 
education founded | by the various relig ious denominations. In common with them 
it owes its origin and existence to the “desire for a better educated ministry. The 
realm of its work is well defined by the charter which requires “that there be at or 
near the city of Richmond a seminary of learning for the instruction of youth in the 
various branches of science and literature.” 
ITS ORIGIN. 
The movement out of which the college grew originated in Richmond City on the 
8th day of June, 1830. During a meeting of the general association of the Baptist 
denomination of the State a society was formed called the ginia Baptist Educa- 
tion Society, which at once began its work by aiding young men in private schools, 
conducted by Revs. Eli Ball and Edward Baptist. Two years later the society 
bought a farm near the city and opened the Virginia Baptist Seminary under the 
presidency of Rey. Robert Ryland, a graduate of Columbian College, Washington, 
D.C. ‘he property was held by the society through trustees. The course of study 
embraced arithmetic, geography, grammar, algebra, geometry, natural and moral 
science, Latin, Greek, with theology as an optional study, The manual labor feature 
was engrafted upon the school, but was soon abandoned. In 1834 the farm was sold 
and the seminary moved to the present eligible and beautiful site of the college just 
within the western boundary of the city. Here the seminary continued its work 
until succeeded by Richmond College, which was chartered by the legislature of the 
State on the 4th day of March, 1840. The teaching force of the seminary through 
these years consisted of the president and two assistants. The course broadened as 
the years went by, and the number of students steadily increased. The first class to 
complete the course went out in 1836, and consisted of four young men, all of whom 
became prominent ministers of the gospel. The same year three of its best equipped 
undergraduates were discharged to become missionaries in China, Siam, and Africa. 
RICHMOND COLLEGE. 
  The date of the college charter and its provisions as to subjects to be taught have 
been given. The desire to advance the seminary into an incorporated institution 
arose from the wish to give greater permanence and security to the enterpr that 
had been so successfully cradled, as well as to enlarge and give greater dignity to 
its work. In due time the transfer of property and all franchises was made by the 
education society, under certain conditions, to the college authorities, and the sub- 
sequent honorable career of the growing institution began. When the seminary 
closed its work it had 8 teachers, 68 students, and valuable property. 
In organizing the college the trustees retained Dr. Ryland at its head, but in a 
short time a fuller corps of teachers were associated with him; the standards of 
admission and of graduation were raised and classes formed for the B, A. degree,

  VIRGINIA. ; 1681 
The first class was graduated in 1849, and the same year the fetters of traditional 
methods were broken, and the curriculum abandoned for a system of classification 
in studies, which more fairly recognized the ability and attainments of the student. 
The new charter had discontinued theological instruction, and no effort has been 
made to revive it. 
Marked prosperity attended the decade from 1851 to 1861. During these years a 
scheme of enlargement in every department was inaugurated. The endowment 
grew to the respectable proportions (for those days) of $80,000. Ampler buildings 
were provided. ‘The attendance of students reached an enrollment of 161. In the 
domain of instruction it was provided that Latin and Greek should be divided and 
each given its separate professor. In 1859 it was decided that “a certificate of pro- 
ficiency be given to a student who has satisfactorily completed the studies of any 
department.” The degree of A. B. was conferred for “‘ proficiency in the depart- 
ments of Latin, Greek, mathematics, natural science and moral science, with the 
privilege of substituting one modern language or Hebrew for the Calculus.” The 
degree of A. M. was conferred for ‘proficiency in the whole course except Hebrew.” 
  A DISASTROUS PERIOD. 
In 1861 came suspension. Richmond was a military camp. Inter arma silent leges. 
Silent also were the voices of science and literature. During the war period and 
extending to the close of the year 1865, there was fearful loss in every direction. 
The endowment became almost wholly worthless. The grounds and buildings were 
seriously injured, the apparatus was a wreck, and the excellent library was robbed 
of every volume. So that when the trustees assembled to confer as to what might 
be done, they found only desolated grounds, defaced buildings, and aruined treasury. 
REORGANIZATION, 
A few. brave and generous spirits threw themselves into the herculean task of reor- 
ganizing the college. Gradually the hopes of its friends were revived and it was 
determined to start afresh upon the work of rebuilding. Rey. Robert Ryland, D. D., 
who had presided over the institution from its origin, resigned, and a new faculty of 
young men of acknowledged ability was selected. The trustees, supported by the 
Baptists of the State, collected what money could be raised from an impoverished 
people, and used it in making the college home as comfortable as possible under the 
circumstances, and in providing for such equipment as was absolutely necessary. 
The first session opened in October, 1866, with the gratifying enrollment of 90 stu- 
dents, and a faculty of 5 accomplished men. 
CHANGES INTRODUCED. 
With the reorganization came conspicuous changes in the old order of things. 
Among these the following should be especially noticed: (1) The system of inde- 
pendent schools was established, with a diploma of graduation in each school; 
(2) the English language was put upon its proper plane as of equal dignity with 
Latin, Greek, French, or German; the ‘‘School of English” was established and has 
been maintained from that time, with its separate professor; (3) discipline was put 
upon the high ground of honor and personal responsibility; (4) attendance upon 
religious services was made voluntary; (5) the “‘messing system” in boarding was 
inaugurated. 
‘These changes in administration have proved to be salutary and have grown into 
the life of the college. 
The past twenty years have witnessed vigorousgrowth. In 1870 a strong and effect- 
ive movement for increased endowment was begun. In 1873 a financial secretary 
was put in charge of the work of securing funds and preserving them by judicious 
investment. About the same time the main edifice, which was begun in 1855, was 
further improved. Cottage dormitories and boarding houses were added, and a more 
complete system of committee work in the several departments was inaugurated. 
At this writing the following statement will indicate the present status of the insti- 
tution: 
The property of the corporation consists of a beautiful campus of 124 acres, well 
set in grass and trees, upon which stand an imposing main edifice, the residences of

building affords ample room for the chapel, lecture rooms, society halls, library, and 
museum. Here may be seen some of the handsomest public ooms in the South. 
Upon the campus ample grounds are provided for students’ sports. The entire prem- 
ises are thoroughly drained and amply provided with all conveniences of gas, water, 
and sewerage. The property is without incumbrance of any sort. 
The endowment has grown to $300,000 of interest-bearing funds. This belongs to 
various departments. Among these are two endowed schools, philosophy and law. 
The scholarships are separately endowed. 
The library rests upon a foundation of its own. The public lectures stand upon 
an ample fund, which is independent. The current expense account has its own 
guaranteed income. While the endowment is far short of the future requirements 
of @ growing college, its past increase and security have been matters of constant 
congratulation and attest the fidelity and liberality of the friends of education. 
The department of instruction embraces nine separate and distinct “schools,” 
Latin, Greek, English, modern languages, philosophy, mathematics, physics, chem- 
istry, law. Each school has its separate professor, who is responsible to the trustees 
alone for its efficient conduct. There are entrance examinations, elective studies, 
intermediate and final examinations, four degrees. The standard of graduation is 
very high, based upon numerical valuation in examinations and class standing. 
Eighty per centum is required before graduation is allowed. 
    SPECIAL FEATURES. 
The library, so ruthlessly destroyed atthe close of the war, has 12,000 volumes. It 
is provided for in the Jeter Memorial Hall, a spacious apartment well adapted to its 
work, and is so conducted, without charge to the student, that it provides the highest 
inducements to literary and scientific research. Liberal provision is made to secure 
to professors and students the latest and best works in every department. To the 
library a well-equipped reading room is attached. Thecollege is buildingamuseum 
of attractiveness, interest, and value. An elegant hall, named for the late James 
Thomas, jr., awaits its successful mounting. Paintings, statuary, and valuabzespeci- 
mens on lines of ethnology, paleontology, geology, and mineralogy are displayed. 
The college has for many years maintained, among other lectures, a course on Bib- 
lical themes. Thisis perhaps the first college in the South to introduce the systematic 
study of the Bible. 
LECTURES. 
To a vigorous course of lectures delivered each session by the professors of the col- 
lege along the line of university extension, and open tothe public, there is anannual 
course of public lectures provided for under a special endowment known as ‘‘ The 
James Thomas Museum Lectures.” This is a course of rare interest. The conditions 
provide that the ablest men in our own and fo: countries shall be secured and 
that the public shall have the privilege of enjoying them. The subjects embraced 
are science, art, philosophy, and literature. 
The Geographical and Historical Society was founded in 1891 for the purpose of 
research. It has a growing membership of professors and students and its issues 
are valuable. By authority of the trustees there has been established under the aus- 
pices of this society aday to be known as ‘‘ Historical Day,” devoted to excursions to 
places of historic interest. ~ 
Two literary societies, with a joint monthly magazine, are maintained. These are 
devoted to the cultivation of the art of speaking and writing. A generous rivalry 
exists, which is further stimulated by medals and public exhibitions. 
Physical culture receives due attention. Regular gymnasium training and drill 
are systematically pursued. Encouragement is given to field sports, to which honors 
are attached. These are awarded on the regular field day exhibition. 
    
THE STUDENT BODY. 
The highest attendance ever reached during a single session is 207. Of the annual 
matriculates Virginia contributes the far larger hare, larger than to any other col- 
lege in the State, but other States and other countries contribute a goodly quota. 
The average age is 19 years. The conduct of the students is marked by a high degree     
-P-A-G-E-467
WEST VIRGINIA. 1683 
of application to work, the bearing of Christian gentlemen, a distinct sense of per- 
sonal honor. The test of standing is not family or money, but personal worth and 
successful study. The day’s exercises are invariably opened with devotional exer- 
cises, conducted by one of the professors. Societies for the cultivation of religious 
life and usefulness are encouraged. The city affords many advantages for personal 
culture and social pleasures, which are cordially embraced by the students. 
THE AIM AND THE OUTLOOK. 
One high aim has ever been kept in view by the college management: Not to gain 
numbers by the sacrifice of scholarship, but to lay deep and broad the foundations 
of solid learning, and to make the diploma a veritable evidence of accurate and gen- 
erous scholarship. So thorough has been the training thatnot asingle graduate has 
failed of success in the various competitive examinations before military or naval 
boards and civil-service examiners, or before the universities to which they have 
gone for advanced work. 
These high purposes of trustees, professors, and students are interwoven with all 
the history of the institution, and will be scrupulously maintained. 
With an unsurpassed location, a beautiful, unencumbered property, a full and 
vigorous faculty, a growing endowment, an interested constituency, and fair pat- 
ronage, with a generous course of study and high standard of graduation, and 
with a Jong line of useful and honored sons interested in her welfare, the future of 
Richmond College would seem full of promise. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
EDUCATION IN WEST VIRGINIA. 
By Rev. A. D. Mayo, M. A., LL. D. 
[From advance sheets of the biennial report of the State superintendent of free schools of West Virginia for the year 1893-94.) 
  It had been my intention for more than one season during a ministry of education 
of fourteen years in the Southern States, in which I had visited every State ever 
called by that name, to give a period of several months to an educational tour 
through West Virginia. Jor various reasons, with the exception of one midsummer 
attendance on the State convention of teachers, this had not been accomplished. A 
partial arrangement to spend a portion of the winter and spring of 1883 in the State 
failed. It was only on April 1, 1894, that I was able to accept the urgent invitation 
of the State superintendent of free schools, Hon. Virgil A. Lewis, and, at Charles- 
ton, the capital city, began an educational visitation of two months which will be 
remembered as one of the most interesting of all similar experiences since the com- 
mencement of my educational work ini the South, in the early months of 1880. 
This tour was necessarily brief, being closed by the ending of the public school 
year in early June in many of the places to which I was invited. Isoon learned 
that the educational people of the Mountain State were in the condition of mind 
represented by a jolly editor in Spartanburg, S. C., who accompanied an invitation 
to visit the people of that enterprising little city with the postscript: ‘Yow ll find 
there’s nothing mean about us. You can lecture every hour in the day, if you want 
to, and we will give you the biggest hall in town and all come to hear what you 
have to say.” ‘Taking account of stock,” on reaching Washington June 1, I ascer- 
tained that, during this visitation of two months, including a dozen of the leading 
educational centers of the State, three of the six State normal schools, the State 
University, and Bethany College, with an unusual opportunity of meeting many of 
the most conspicuous educational and public men, clergymen, professional men, and 
friends of education, I had delivered a larger number of popular lectures, always 
to generous audiences, than the number of days in my tour; carefully inspected the 
schools of all the cities and districts visited; been given the most ample opportunity 
for a front, rear, and side view of all things going on in educational affairs; and, as

  far as the most confidential expression of opinion was concerned, placed in posses- 
sion of an amount of information requiring a longer time to digest and put in shape 
for quiet consideration than was spent in its acquiring. 
And a longer time than this—I trust as long as I remain in the flesh—will be 
required to disentangle myself from the mood of enthusiastic appreciation of all I 
saw and heard and felt during those memorable weeks; the magnetism of great 
crowds of school children, each a blossoming flower-garden a little lovelier than the 
last; the crowded and eager public audiences that every where welcomed my free and 
easy talks on universal education; the congregations that filled the largest churches 
on Sunday afternoons and evenings, in the most populous towns, where I was 
impressed into the service of preaching the gospel according to education; the pleas- 
ant greeting of teachers in the city, village, and rural schools to listen to addresses 
on the fundamental American profession; the earnest listening at the normal schools 
and the hearty welcome at the State University; with everywhere the offer of the 
most friendly hospitality; all woven into a ‘long sweet song” by the children, 
everywhere singing: ‘‘Oh, the West Virginia Hills.” 
But all this, instead of being an obstacle to an honest and impartial judgment of 
educational affairs in the State, was itself but an indication of a remarkable educa- 
tional interest among the people, who seemed to me prepared to ‘‘shake hands” with 
anybody who appeared, properly certified, inviting them ‘‘to come and reason 
together” on the theme that lies ai the foundations of our American civilization. 
I therefore accept with pleasure the suggestion of State Superintendent Lewis not 
only to resume my visit to West Virginia during the coming autumn and winter, but 
also to furnish an informal report of my observations during my first journeying 
through the State. Of course I understand the meaning of the distinguished metro- 
politan editor, lately returned from a three months’ tour in Europe, who said to his 
interviewer: -‘A railroad journey of three months through central Europe and Rus- 
sia hardly qualifies a man to talk at large on public affairs in Europe.” Still, after 
an experience of fourteen years journeying through all the Southern States, in the 
especial interest of common school education, everywhere afforded the most ample 
facilities for looking upon both the educational fatness and leanness of the land; 
reenforced by a long and diligent study of the industrial, religious, social, and pub- 
lic conditious of this section of the country at all periods of its development; with 
attention specially devoted to the effect of environment upon the educational depart- 
ment of these sixteen States; 1 feel that even the hasty investigation possible dur- 
ing these crowded weeks has left a deposit of fact and awakened a depth of feeling 
which may be a qualification to accept the suggestion of the State superintendent 
of free schools. 
Certainly there could be no justice or propriety in making this essay a criticism 
or commendation of school teachers and schools in the different communities visited. 
All that was of use in this directionwas fairly give to the proper authorities at the 
time. But there is nothing to forbid an impartial record of the observations of a 
stranger who has studied with the deepest interest the entire history of this State, 
and been awakened to a thorough appreciation of all he has heard and seen of its 
past and present condition. An intimate acquaintance with every one of the old- 
time slave-holding States may also add to the value of my estimate of the work 
done in West Virginia since 1863 in behalf of universal education; the trend of the 
currents of educational activity; what has been well begun; what has already been 
accomplished; on what lines there seems to be the greatest present necessity for 
vigorous action; and what should be the grand aim of the educators of the Common- 
wealth in laying deep and broad the foundations for a future that only the most 
inexcusable folly and obstinacy can hinder from its great fruition. 
Iam more encouraged to accept the invitation from the fact, not yet explained to 
myself, that, of all the more important States of the old South, West Virginia has, 
educationally, been the last to be introduced to the public attention of the great line 
of Commonwealths that stretch from the Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast. 
The explosion of patriotic congratulation, thirty years ago, when these 54 north- 
western counties of the Old Dominion broke loose from their mother State and boldly 
committed their destiny, as anew Commonwealth, to the salvation of the Union;       
        
    
    - with the few months of ‘‘short, sharp, and decisive” warfare which threw their ter- 
ritory into possession of the Union armies until the close of the war; was soon 
overwhelmed by the absorbing interest of the great campaign on the Potomac and 
James and the Mississippi. At the close of the great conflict West Virginia was 
already a fully organized State of the Union, and stepped to her place, as the child 
of the great conflict, with a vigor and confidence that left the impression that no 
special sympathy or aid was required from any quarter. The insignificance innum- 
bers of her colored population was a reason for the lack of interest in the great 
body of Christian and philanthropic organinations of the North which, after experi- 
menting for thirty years, are now learning that the most effective way to lift up the 
seven millions of American negroes is to aid in the education of the ten millions of
-P-A-G-E-469

  white folk who form the next social strata above. The estrangement of the people 
of the ex-Confederate States prevented any considerable immigration from that quar- 
ter to this new Commonwealth, although a million young men have left the Old South 
for the Northwest and the Southwest since 1865. The sparse population, in 1865 
scarcely reaching a third of a million; the poverty of the great majority of the peo- 
ple; the lack of home capital and of reliable information concerning the resources 
of the new State; allthese may in a measure account for the fact that no Common- 
wealth of anything like the importance of West Virginiais to-day so in need of the 
higher species of advertisement for a genuine understanding by the whole American 
people. ‘Therefore, it isnot somuch for any supposed advantage to the educators 
and people of West Virginia that I write out this hasty sketch of my observations. 
Rather do I 1ook to the great outward public, which needs information concerning 
the wonder and prophecy bound up in these 24,715 square miles of mountain, valley, 
mine, and forest. And especially is the educational experience of West Virginia so 
peculiar that it may be said to have woven the vital cord between the education of 
the old and the new South; her entire educational life as the ‘‘mountain pasture” 
of the Old Dominion being in itself an education especially fitting her people for 
their remarkable coming to the front in 1863 as the first Southern State that of itself 
organized universal education according to the plan of the American common school. 
It is not difficult to understand the source of the characteristic State pride of the 
superior class of the Old Dominion, when the vast extent of its great territory from 
the beginning of the seventeenth to the eighteenth century is taken into account. 
Apart from the wonderful development of public ability at the outbreak of the 
Revolution, and the powerful influence of the leading class of Virginia up to the 
beginning of the civil war, thero is a fair cause for pride in the feeling that Virginia 
has never been more notably the Mother of Presidents than the Mother of States. 
As late as 1775 the province of Virginia included tho Territory of Kentucky, the 
five original Northwestern States, and the present Virginia and West Virginia. In 
1860 Vil ia was still one of the larger States of the Union, containing 67,000 
square miles. But with its magnificent seaport, its splendid system of rivers, its 
broad realm of fertile fields, its prodigious treasures of minerals, timber, and water- 
power, and the excellent strain of its original Anglo-Saxon population, it remained 
the wonder of the nation that it had so little improved its great opportunity for 
material wealth and industrial power. Up to a period considerably later than the 
Revolution, the great drama of life in old Virginia had been wrought out in a region 
little larger than the State of Massachusetts, the narrow margin between the 
Atlantic Coast and the Alleghany Mountains; even the Shenandoah Valley and the 
wonderful reaches of Southwest Virginia haye had but small influence in public 
affairs. The original people that came to this ‘‘ God’s Country,” beyond the Blue 
Ridge, made haste to get away from it and poured through the mountain passes into 
Kentucky and the new Northwest, leaving their own superb land behind and quite 
neglecting the area of nearly 25,000 square miles at the north, now known as the 
State of West Virginia. Later the movement down the Ohio River generally gave 
this territory the cold shoulder, and pushed on to the Ohio and the more distant 
Territories, leaving behind a straggling population along the 50 miles of charming 
valley where are now situated the larger cities of the Commonwealth. The new 
Erie Canal and the opening of steam navigation on the Great Lakes still further 
diverted the stream of eastern emigration from this country, and there was little to 
attract the thronging multitudes of Europe to its wilderness of opportunity. Hence, 
at the breaking out of the war in 1861, this region remained still away in the rear 
of the proud Old Dominion, scarcely attracting attention by its secession from the 
Mother State. In 1860 the population of this area, three times the extent of the 
State of Massachusetts, was not larger than that of Boston to-day—less than 270,000; 
no town haying the requisite population to entitle it to a city organization in 
Massachusetts. 
In addition to this, we must take into consideration the singular neglect that had 
befallen this portion of the State from old Virginia. It was not so much any special 
hostility to the development of this portion of the State as the inevitable result of 
its social and industrial organization that left the people of this far-off country in a 
growing state of estrangement from their neglectful mother. As the writer of The Mountain State says, ‘‘‘The early days of West Virginia were not conducive to the 
rapid advancement of the State. In the old State that part west of the mountains 
had always been looked down upon as a wilderness, and little attention was ever 
given to it. The people complained, for years, that they were permitted by the State 
to.do nothing but pay their taxes. Their representation in the councils of the State 
was small and, by the Old Dominion, that portion of her domain west of the moun- 
tains was practically ignored.” The superior class of Virginia, until 1860, devoted 
its energics far more to the problem of the leadership of the entire South, in all 
essential ways then drifting toward a decisive conflict with the Union, every year 
more threatening, than to developing its own splendid domain and educating its

  own people to the ability to comprehend and improve such an opportunity as never before in history was offered to a population so small. 
But all this has passed away in the advent of a new generation. From the inter- 
esting data furnished and indorsed by public authority, we learn that the publica- 
tion of the great natural resources of West Virginia practically dates from the year 
of the Centennial Exposition, in Philadelphia, in 1876. During the past twenty 
years the people of the United States have first come to the knowledge of the impor- 
tance of this new Commonwealth, the child of the great war for the preservation 
of the Union. From thenumerous public documents—which read more like aromance 
of industry than a mass of substantial informatioh—we learn that while in 1863 there 
was but ono railroad in West Virginia, there are now but 11 of its 54 counties desti- 
tute of this manner of communication, and that during the year 1892 this State led 
the Union in the extent of railroad construction. Three great lines now connect 
this State with the Atlantic Coast and the Mississippi Valley, and numerous arteries 
of these great systems and supplementary routes have opened. portions of the Com- 
monwealth hitherto little known. From a meager production of coal for domestic 
use in 1863, the output of the mines in 1892 was 10,000,000 tons, from 200 mines, 
employing 15,000 workmen, representing a population one-sixth as large as the entire 
inhabitants of West Virginia in 1860. ‘Ten million acres of West Virginia soil are 
underlaid by a coal deposit 10 feet thick, a larger area than the coal district of 
Great Britain, with an estimated output of 10,000,000,000 tons. It is estimated that 
the coal of West Virginia exceeds the value of the gold and silver mines of the Pacific 
States. Only 3 of the 54 counties are destitute of the coal supply. It is asserted 
that the present population of the United States could be supplied with its usual 
consumption of coal for 1,000 years, from West Virginia alone. 
One-half the State is still ‘in the woods,” the virgin forests furnishing a larger 
amount of hard-wood timber than any other State, and the growing timber industry 
giving occupation to another army of 15,000 men. The great lumber belt is 200 by 
25 miles in extent, 7,000 square miles—nearly as extensive as the State of New Jersey. 
The timber crop at present is valued at $70,000,000; 500,000,000 feet being put on the 
market each year. An ex-governor of West Virginia declares that this State “has 
more of a surplus of hard wood than any other ten States of the Union.” The alti- 
tude of the Statice, from 500 to 5,000 feet above tide water, and the climate are favor- 
able to a vast and vigorous growth of forest life, 32 reliable varieties of hard and 
soft wood lumber being furnished for the markets of the world. 
The world’s production of iron in 1890 amounted to 26,500,000 gross tons, of which 
the United States produced 33 per cent. West Virginia shares with its neighboring 
States, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Ohio, a generous deposit of this material, the 
foundation of all manufacturing industries. In the production of coke West Vir- 
ginia stands next to Pennsylvania, in 1892 supplying 1,313,449 tons. The salt wells 
at ono time supported a leading industry in the State, and although the production 
of salt has declined by competition with other States, it still awaits a-future devel- 
opment that may become of great importance. George Washington, whose hand 
and eye seem to have been on everything of value in the new Union, in 1775 located 
an acre of Jand near Charleston, W. Va., as a natural curiosity, a “burning spring.” 
To-day the oil wells and gas plants of the State are rapidly encroaching on Pennsyl- 
vania in extent and importance; indeed, one oil district, Sistersville, is the most 
extensive in the world. It is asserted that West Virginia led Pennsylvania thirty 
years in the utilization of natural gas for manufactures and the use of coal oil. The 
traveler by night along the valley of the Ohio in this State is lighted on his way by 
these fiery signals of the amazing wealth stored in these vast reservoirs of nature. 
This industry is still in its infancy, being the result of the past twenty years experi- 
menting, and its outcome can not be predicted. An experiment in paving a city     
      street with fire brick in Charleston, W. Va., planned by Dr. John P. Hall, has given ‘ 
to several of the larger cities of the Union this admirable pavement, and this State 
can furnish the material to an extent not even yet understood. The building stones 
of the State are numerous and-of great value. The wealth of West Virginia in 
mineral waters has been long understood. Its southeastern border is crowded with 
attractive summer resorts, where the health-giving waters and beautiful scenery 
are every year more widely appreciated. 
But for the lover of nature and the primitive industry of man—the cultivation of 
the soil—West Virginia especially deserves the name given by the jolly ‘Knights of 
the Golden Horseshoe” in the early days of the Old Dominion to the entire region 
beyond the Blue Ridge, ‘‘God’s country.” Although sadly neglected, like the entire 
central mountain region of tho old South (as extensive as the German Empire, and, 
according to expert testimony, capable of an agricultural developement as great as 
Germany), during the first one hundred years of headlong immigration from the 
old East to the future Northwest and Southwest, this country bides its time and 
unless paralyzed by some impracticable political or industrial policy, in half a cen- 
tury from to-day may become one of the most attractive portions of the Republic.  
-P-A-G-E-471
    
WEST VIRGINIA. 1687 
West Virginia touches upon the northern and southern belts of production with a 
good portion of her own acres capable of successful cultivation. Her productionsare 
corn, wheat, oats, buckwheat, and vegetables. In garden stuffs she has a great 
future ahead. The fruits of the North, apples, berries, and especially the grape, 
can be grown here to great advantage. But in the possession of a vast area of the 
precious blue grass there is no American State which has such a mine of wealth. 
No traveler who has looked on the lovely spectacle of the rolling country just retired 
from the valley of the Ohio in its early summer dress, or on the cultivated farms 
reaching the summits of the grass-covered hills and mountains, can doubt that in 
the support of cattle, sheep, and all the varieties of animal industry the State has a 
remarkable opportunity ahead. No estimate of the loss by the old-time, ignorant, 
provincial habit of farming to this portion of the country can be made. But every 
_dollar now expended upon the coming generation of the youth of West Virginia to 
lift her people above the wasteful and crude habits of using the land will come back, 
before many days, in an era of prosperity. As we now look upon our great Eastern 
cities, in the midsummer swarming with an army of ‘the unemployed,” too often 
people who are being nursed into a chronic class of the improvident and indolent, 
dependent upon the crumbs that fall from the tables of wealth in old communities, 
we long for a new departure in public charity which shall put a fist with steam 
power behind it to force a multitude of these dependent families to a land like 
‘West Virginia, where, with half the toil and sacrifice endured by the pioneers of 
every American Commonwealth, they could live in peace, comfort, and with the 
gain of character, self-respect, and hope for the children which can never come to 
them in their present surroundings. 
There can be no doubt that the present resources of West Virginia are competent to 
support a larger population than is now gathered in any State of the Union. And 
it only requires a liberal home policy, an extension of common school facilities, 
with an annex of industrial education, to realize the most enthusiastic expectations 
of its best informed citizens. So far the Stato is being saved, except in a few min- 
ing districts, from an undue per cent of the lower element of recent foreign labor. 
It has the added advantage of exemption from the presence of great masses of the 
lower orders of colored people, who for many years must be both a tax and a strong 
appeal to Christian wisdom, charity, and patriotism in the majority of Southern 
States. 
It is almost incredible to a traveler, for the first time made acquainted with this 
great and beautiful mountain State, that with a steady development during thirty 
years past, there are still a smaller number of people living upon the 24,715 square 
miles than within the area of 30 miles in and around the city of Boston. It may be that 
in this attractive mountain land, at the center of the old Union, will be developed 
the class we all pray for, that will inaugurate a movement back from the dangers 
and dependencies of city life, where thousands now welter in poverty, hopeless of 
better things, to this glorious open country, to begin anew the struggle for an inde- 
pendent and valuable American citizenship. 
But in no respect has West Virginia given such evidence of vitality and progres- 
sive spirit as in the extraordinary development of public education during the past 
thirty years. It is doubtfalif any State of the Union in 1860 could present a more 
meager array of educational opportunities and a more discouraging spectacle of 
widespread illiteracy than this portion of the Old Dominion. There are no statistics 
of the relative illiteracy of different portions of the country, of decisive value, pre- 
vious to the civil war. But the testimony of all the more observing older peoplo of 
this entire region of Virginia west of the Alleghanies, including the rural districts 
of the present southwest Virginia and West Virginia, bears hardly upon both these 
States in this respect. Up to the breaking out of the civil war the present 54 coun- 
ties of West Virginia were but poorly supplied with what was the only genuine 
educational opportunity offered by old Virginia, the colleges and academies estab- 
lished for the higher and secondary education. At this period Virginia east of the 
Alleghanies was, without question, the portion of the South best supplied with these 
facilities for superior instruction. Half a dozen colleges of average reputation, 
with the University of Virginia—then and perhaps still the leader of Southern uni- 
versities of the higher grade—and ascore of academies, private and denominational, 
afforded a reasonable opportunity for the schooling of the day to all who were able 
to pay the cost. Besides this, there was still a considerable group of families who 
educated their children by home tutorship or in the superior schools of the North 
and Europe. The real disability was with the masses of the white people, unable to 
meet the expense and, perhaps, often disinclined to make the proper exertion to 
secure an education for their children. 
The educational ‘‘delusion and snare” of that time, the ‘free school,” practi- 
cally a pauper school, despised by those to whom it was offered and contemptuously 
neglected by those whose duty it was to provide an effective scheme of common 
schooling for the majority of the citizens of the State, was the common method of  
-P-A-G-E-472

dealing with the problem of universal education which had brooded like a night- 
mare over the thoughts of the great fathers of the Commonwealth and made Thomas 
Jefferson, in his old age, almost despair of the Republic. There was a law in 1860 
by which two-thirds of the voters of a county could adopt a modified system of 
common schooling. But with the limitations of the suffrage and the indisposition 
of the well-to-do people to ‘tax themselves for the education of other people’s chil- 
dren,” only a few counties of the State had put it into active operation. Of these, 
however, five leading counties in West Virginia were conspicuous, and the little 
cities of Wheeling and Charleston had laid the foundation for their present system 
of public schools. There was but one college (Bethany) founded in 1840, and a few 
secondary academies of note had been established in this portion of the State. But 
it may be that even in this deprivation was found the most favorable condition for 
the establishment of the people’s common school. The neighboring States of Vir- 
ginia, Kentucky, and North Carolina, in 1860, like the more important of the Gulf 
States, were almost clogged to repletion with this class of academical schools, 
chiefly denominational, which, although of great service to the communities in 
which they were established, often became the most obstinate opponents to the 
establishment of an effective system of free popular education. The great revival 
of nationalism that flung the majority of the people of these West Virginia counties, 
in 1861, out of the arms of their neglectful mother into close companionship with 
the adjacent Commonwealths of the North, the public attention every where directed 
to this supreme act, and the inspiration of a four years’ conflict for ‘ Liberty an 
Union,” doubtless gave a prodigious impulse to the “educational spirit. 
It was observed that the committee on education in the first constitutional con- 
vention of West Virginia, held in 1863, was composed largely of delegates from tho 
counties that had already adopted a public school system, as far as was possible 
under the laws of the Old Dominion. The clause in the fundamental law relating 
to education has a determined ring, prophetic of all that has been achieved in the 
Commonwealth. West Virginia was the first Southern State to establish the entire 
American system of common schools. Even during the distractions of the civil war, 
in 1863, this provision was placed in the constitution, and, with only a slight 
amendment in the revised constitution of 1872, it remains the foundation of the 
people’s education in West Virginia to-day. 
This clause of the constitution reads as follow: 
“The legislature shall provide, as soon as practicable, for the establishment of a 
thorough and efficient system of free schools. They shall provide for the support of 
such schools by appropriating thereto the interest of the invested school fund, the 
net proceeds of all forfeitures, confiscations, and fines accruing to this State under 
the laws thereof, and by general taxation on persons and property, or otherwise. 
They shall also provide for raising in each township, by the authority of the people 
thereof, such a proportion of the amount required for the support of free schools 
therein as shall be prescribed by general laws.” 
The story of the remarkable progress of the common school in West Virginia, 
during the thirty years from this fortunate beginning, in 1863, is so well told by 
ex-superintendent of free schools, Hon. Benjamin 8. Morgan, i in an elaborate sketch 
accompanying the State school report of 1891-92, that it is only for the information 
of readers outside the State that even a brief summary of the successive steps of this 
achievement is made in the presentessay. Suffice to say that the first legislature of 
the new Commonwealth, the last of the illustrious family of States born from the 
yast territory of the Old Dominion, distinguished its by decisive and wise action 
on the subject of public education. Responding to the suggestion of Governor 
Arthur I. Boreman, the two houses of the legislature placed on their educational 
committees a group of men already known and tried as successful teachers and res- 
olute advocates of the inalienable right of the children to schooling for American 
citizenship. After a three months’ discussion of two reports, on December 10, 1863, 
a scheme of public instruction was inaugurated and put in operation by the election 
of Rey. William R. White as State superintendent of free schools. 
The system was substantially that of the adjoining States of Ohio and Pemnsylva- 
nia. It placed West Virginia, in point of time, seven years in advance of the mother 
State, which did not move until 1870, and then came to her youngest child for her 
great executive superintendent of education, a descendant of the old Ruffner family, 
commemorated in the First Presbyterian Church of Charleston. It contemplated a 
general system of free education for all classes and both races at public expense, 
sufficiently broad and flexible to admit of a complete development through the 
advancing grades of elementary, grammar, secondary, normal, and university educa- 
tion. No institution so radical and far- reaching i in all its relations to society as the 
American common school springs at a bound to ay igorous life inany Commonwealth. 
It is not at all singular that a State in the condition of West Vir ginia, born amid the 
opening throes of a terrible civil war, could not, during the progress of the conflict, 
educationally stand erect. It is not to be wondered at that, even in 1865, the year 
        
-P-A-G-E-473
WEST VIRGINIA. : 1689 
  of the advent of peace, the new school law was in operation in only 20 counties and 
partially in 11 more, the number of schoolhouses being 133 and the number of schools 
431, the enrollment of pupils 15,972, the average length of the schools 49 days, and 
the whole amount expended for free schooling $7,772. But more favorable was the 
report for 1866, showing that the number of schools taught and the attendance of 
pupils had doubled: Schools 935, pupils 34,219, and the length of the country school 
had been extended to 69 days. 
The advent of peace was the signal for a most important forward movement in the 
educational policy of the State. In 1867 three of the present State normal schools 
were established, among them the Fairmont School, the leading seminary from the 
first and, to-day, one of the most effective schools of its kind in the Southern States. 
That the new Commonwealth of West Virginia, just getting on its new State legs 
from the wreck, discouragement, and disintegration of a four years’ civil war, 
should have done, as a matter of course, what Ohio, the fifth State in population 
and not behind the first in importance in the Union, has not yet been able to achieve 
and what Virginia waited twenty years longer to obtain—establish a system of 
State normal schools—is certainly one of the anomalies of American life. 
But the brave little Mountain State, with a population less than 800,000 and an 
assessed valuation of $190,000,000, took another forward step and at the session of 
the legislature in 1867 passed the act establishing a State agricultural college. This 
institution was founded on the national appropriation of land for agricultural and 
mechanical colleges to all the States, passed during the war period, July 2, 1862. 
West Virginia received 150,000 acres of public land which was sold for $90,000; a 
sum increased by legislative appropriation to $110,000. Asin many of the States, 
the early establishment of the college was made easy by a gift from the city of 
Morgantown, Monongalia County, of school property, including one of the most 
attractive university sites in the Union. In 1868 the first building waserected. The 
board of regents laid the foundation of the new college on broad educational lines. 
President Martin was installed in 1867, and held the position till 1875. In 1868 
124 students were gathered. In 1881, after a dozen years of gradual growth, the 
institution, under the brief presidency of William L. Wilson, now “of eminent 
reputation in statesmanship, was practically reorganized and placed on a proper 
basis of instruction, with eight distinct departments and professional schools for law 
and medicine, 
In 1870, only seven years from the establishment of the system, the birthyear of 
the common schools in Virginia, Superintendent W. illiams reported 2,113 school- 
houses, an increase of 30 per cent from the previous year and 87,330 children enrolled 
in school, a gain of 20 per cent in enrollment and 40 per cent in average attendance. 
Well might Governor Stevenson, in 1871, declare, ‘‘The public school system may 
now be regarded as a part of our fixed policy. ”’ In 1872 three additional normal 
schools were established, making six institutions supported by the State for the 
instruction of teachers. 
The summing up of this remarkable nine years’ work by State Superintendent 
Pendleton, in 1872, is a record of which no American Commonwealth, save our new 
Western States, which began their educational career with the great advantage of 
the national publi land fund, on a virgin soil and generally with a trained school 
population, can boast. West Virginia, with no part nor lot in the original distri- 
bution of school lands to the States west of the Alleghanies, largely by her own 
unaided effort, was able to say to the people of the United States, in 1872, in the 
eloquent language of her State superintendent: 
‘‘Reviewing our progress in the noble efforts of the State to provide for the free 
education of the whole people, we have reason for profound gratitude at our com- 
parative success. With a million and a quarter of capital invested in school prop- 
erty; 3,000 schools in actual operation, and three-quarters of a million annually 
contributed to run them; 90,000 children under intellectual and moral training; a 
number of graded and high schools; 4 normal schools in vigorous operation, for 
which we are annually expending out of the State treasury over $8,000; a university 
on which we bestow over $16,000, and other private and corporate institutions, 
-among them one college largely endowed, and through its 400 graduates already 
enjoying a national reputation, West Virginia may well be proud of her position in 
this highest expression of a people’s patriotism and enterprise. Within less than a 
single decade there was, outside of the city of Wheeling, scarcely a free school in 
the State. Now they rise up to greet us beside every highway, and betoken a future 
of rapid and vigorous improvement. This is a revolution that can not go back- 
ward. It creates its own momentum. It moves by a power within, which increases 
as it moves, and which strikes out the light and heat of its own vitality.” 
And here came in another incident that fitly illustrates an important characteristic 
of the American system of universal education, that it is not dependent on the great 
political divisions by which the public affairs of this country, as of all constitutional 
Governments, are carried on. Up to 1872 the State had adhered to the policy of the   
-P-A-G-E-474
  1690 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
political party which carried the nation victoriously through the war, and was respon- 
sible for the reorganization of the ex-Confederate States and the amendments to the 
Constitution of the United States. But under the lead of the successful Democratic 
party, in 1872, a new constitution was set up in West Virginia, and the State has 
since been committed to the principles and policy of this political organization. 
But in this change, which came about with the usual display of excited partisan 
feeling, there was no break in the progress of thé people’s schools, without which no 
party in the United States can live and the best party will inevitably destroy the 
Republic. It is not the name of the political organization but the quality of 
the people who compose it that decides, in the last result, what shall be the ten- 
dency and outcome of legislation in any American State. Under the new constitu- 
tion the school law of 1873 was passed, which remains substantially the present law 
of the State. We abbreviate Superintendent Morgan’s statement in the “ History 
of Education in West Virginia” concerning the provisions of this statute: 
The schools are free and supported by the income of the State school fund, a State 
tax of 10 cents on $100 of all taxable property, with provision for the local taxation 
of school districts, including the right to establish graded schools in cities, villages, 
and populous country districts. A vote of three. fifths of the people is required for 
the establishment of a free high school. In 1892 there were 145 systems of graded 
and 17 public high schools in the State. ‘Hang a good thing up for seven years and 
you will haveause forit.” Old Virginia “hung up” Thomas Jefferson’s plan for the 
education of the Old Dominion, at the time in some respects the broadest that 
had been presented to the world, for about one hundred years, to see it taken down 
from the high shelf by her own youngest child in 1863 as an indispensable article of 
furniture in the setting up of its new housekeeping. With the additions and enlarge- 
ments of one hundred years of American experience, the State, in 1892, has created 
practically a correlated system; in the words of Huxley, ‘‘ Reaching from the gutter 
to the university,” needing only the improvements later referred to in this essay as the 
most enlightened demand of its own educational public to place the Mountain State 
atthe head of its own section, well up in the first rank of educational American 
Commonwealths. 
It is unnecessary to pursue in detail this interesting record of the steady growth of 
the common school in West Virginia, through the administration of nine State super- 
intendents, to that of the present earnest and patriotic official, Hon. Virgil A. Lewis, 
now in the second year of his good work. The most original feature in this period 
is the movement for the improved grading of the country district school, inaugurated 
in 1875, under the county superintendence of Mr. A. L. Wade, in Monongalia Conny 
the seat of the State University. 
Here has been, for a century, the great stumbling block of the American system of 
public instruction—the proper organization, as respects a graded course of instruc- 
tion and its application to the peculiar needs of the country district schools, in which 
the majority of the children in the Union and nine-tenths of the youth in the sixteen 
Southern States receive their entire schooling. It is indeed only recently that the 
oldest States have deemed it necessary or possible to do anything for the relief of the 
almost insuperable defects of such a condition as still prevails through wide regions 
of the country; where therural district school goes on through its accustomed round 
from three to eight months in the year, practically managed by local trustees, often 
kept by the man or woman personally most agreeable to “the committee,” with no 
provision for compulsory attendance; the children coming to school according to the 
nearness or distance of their place of residence, the attractiveness of the school- 
house, and the popularity of the teacher; every little squad really ‘‘ going on its own 
hook,” sometimes almost insisting on individual teaching; usually the school of 20 
to 50 children in one room, chopped up into “mincemeat” by a division into little 
classes that makes the daily session a headlong race of hearing short lessons, with 
scarcely an attempt at the proper class or general work that tells on the entire school 
and promotes that most valuable discipline, the instruction together of a large 
number, by which each pupil enjoys the advantages of a roundabout view of the 
subject by all. Edmund Burke says: “Every man becomes ten men by working 
with his fellows.” There is still no department of American education which, in 
proportion to its cost, its momentous influence on the national life, and the national 
sense of its great value to the Republic, exhibits sach a melancholy waste of money 
and energy, such confusion and failure of good educational results as are apparent 
to every competent observer in the ordinary country district school. And still, since 
this department of the common school is so common, so near the mass of the people, 
so dependent on a great variety of conditions peculiar to each locality for its success, 
the efforts to reform it by public legislation, up to the period of the general revival 
of education that followed the close of the civil war, had been few and ineffectual. 
It was characteristic that the one State of the Union born amid the confusion and 
terror of civil war, should not only, as declared by County Supt. A. L. Wade, in 
1876, ‘have accomplished more in the work of building schoolhouses and setting 
    
-P-A-G-E-475

  in operation the machinery of the free school system in the last thirteen years than 
any other State of like territory and wealth ever did in a quarter of a century,” 
but also be able to claim the honor of inaugurating, in 1874, a movement for the 
improved grading and graduation of pupils in the country district school which 
attracted the attention and secured the hearty indorsement of United States Com- 
missioner of Education Hon. John Eaton, in 1878. Commissioner Eaton declares: 
“Of all plans developed, none has excited more attention than that known as the 
graduating system for country schools, devised by A. L. Wade, superintendent of 
Monongalia County, W. Va. It has been reviewed by all the educational journals 
and has excited the attention of the principal school superintendents of the country.” 
This indorsement, from the highest educational authority of the country, was 
neither premature nor exaggerated. Introduced in 1874, in a county hardly known 
by name outside the new Commonwealth of West Virginia, by the superintendent 
of a district containing some 5,000 pupils, all but 400 in rural district schools; a 
county which, in 1863, had but one country schoolhouse considered fit for oceupa- 
tion, and in which, even in 1874, not more than 59 per cent of the enumerated chil- 
dren of school age, from 6 to 21, were attending school, and few of them taking even 
the meager course of study then suggested by the State school law—this able school- 
man and most efficient administrator was able to report at the end of the year, in 
1876, that he had inaugurated a reform in all these particulars which made the rural 
school keeping of his own county a beacon light to the State, and which was influ- 
ential in setting in motion a movement which is now an accomplished fact in many 
of the States of the Union. Perhaps, in its final outcome, this new departure may 
be fraught with greater practical benefits than any forward steps in common school 
affairs since the days of Horace Mann. 
For a detailed account of this achievement the reader must be referred to the inter- 
esting volume, A Graduating System for County Schools, Boston, 1881, prepared by 
County Superintendent Wade. 
From the title of this work, it will be seen thatits author provided for a ‘ graduat- 
ing system,” but did not provide a graded course of study for the country and village 
schools. Butitwas doubtless suggestive of this, for in 1882 Hon. B.S. Morgan, after- 
wards an efiicient State superintendent of free schools, was elected county superin- 
tendent of Monongalia County, and in the autumn of that year had printed at his 
own expense a brief Course of Study for the Céuntry and Village Schools of This 
County. This was the first printed course used in the State. Ity proved most satis- 
factory, and in 1890, in compliance with a recommendation of the West Virginia 
Edueational Association, made at its meeting at Parkersburg, in August, 1890, a com- 
mittee was appointed to prepare a course of study for the country and village schools 
of the State. This committee was composed of M. Lee, superintendent of the free 
schools of Huntington; G. 8. Laidley, superintendent of the free schools of Charles- 
ton; J. W. Hinkle, ex-county superintendent of Greenbrier County and principal of 
the free schools of Hinton; A, L. Wade, ex-county superintendent of Monongalia 
County, and State Supt. B. ’g. Mor, gan. 
This work was accomplished, and, at the suggestion of Mr. Morgan, then State 
superintendent, the legislature, in 1890, passed an amendment to the school laws 
which, after naming the branches to be taught in the primary schools, declares: “It 
shall be the duty of the State superintendent to prescribe a manual and graded 
course of primary instruction to be followed in the country and village schools 
through the State, arranging the order in which the several branches shall be taken 
up and studied and the time to be devoted to them, respectively, with provisions for 
advancement from class to class, also for the examination and graduation of all 
pupils who satisfactorily complete the prescribed course.” Under this provision of 
Jaw Supt. B. S. Morgan in August, 1891, sent out the course of study which the 
committee had prepared, and the work of grading began; but the course was | 
found to be too brief, and when the edition had become exhausted Hon. Virgil A. 
Lewis, who had entered upon the duties of State superintendent of free schools in 
1893, in the autumn of that year begaa work along this line, and the result was the 
elaborate Manual and Graded Course of Study for County and Village Schools, 
which he has distributed, and according to which more than half the schools of the 
State have been graded and classified. As the result of a careful study of this most 
vital feature in the management of rural schools of the country, this manual should 
be widely known and compared with similar publications in other States. 
The following quotations from Superintendent Morgan’s History of Education in 
West Virginia and the report of County Superintendent Wade will suggest the radi- 
cal idea and general outline of this new departure. s Superintendent Morgan: 
“A movement of such importance deserves more than a passing notice. The author 
defines ‘the graduating system for country schools’ to be simply taking the pri- 
mary branches as a course of study for graduation, and making application of all the 
plans and appliances of the best academies and colleges to the common. schools of 
the country. It is the application of an old plan toa new purpose, The time in 
   
-P-A-G-E-476

which each advanced pupil ought to complete this course of study is announced. 
Public examinations of graduating classes are held annually, at points agreed upon, 
in each county, and common school diplomas are granted to those who satisfactorily 
complete the course of study. 
“An alumni association, holding annual meetings for the mutual improvement of 
those who have graduated, is organized in every magisterial district. 
“A catalogue, containing a clear statement of the work of each school, is pub- 
lished annually in each county. In this catalogue each school occupies sufficient 
space to give: 
“*(1) The name of the school. 
(2) The name of the teacher. 
“(3) The number of youths entitled to attend. 
“((4) The number of youths in actual attendance. 
“(5) The number of youths entitled to attend, but not in attendance. 
“(6) The daily averago attendance. 
“(7) The daily per centof attendance, based upon the number in attendance and 
the number entitled to attend but not in attendance. 
‘*(8) The branches taught and the number studying each branch. 
“(9) The names of the pupils who have graduated, and the dates of their gradu- 
ation. 
(10) The names of pupils who ought to complete the course of study in one, two, 
three, or four years, making clear the class to which each belongs. Pupils who can 
not complete the course of study in four years or less compose the preparatory 
department, but their names do not appear in the catalogues. 
“This catalogue contains also the annual report of the county superintendent, 
presenting the results of the work of the past year, and his recommendation for the 
future, a synopsis of the proceedings of the several alumni associations, the names 
of officers, and the time and place of the next annual meeting of each association, 
and also brief obituary notices of teachers and graduates and undergraduates who 
have died within the year. 
“This system may be introduced into the schools of a State or a county, and can 
be tested even in a township, or district, or in a single school.” 
Superintendent Wade’s report concerning the working of his system at its begin- 
ning reads as follows: : 
“The time for the examination of graduating classes began to grow near, and 
croakers were busy prophesying that the whole system would prove a failure. Such 
a thing, they said, as graduating in country schools never has been done and never 
will. I watched anxiously the effect of these predictions, and I was highly gratified 
to find that teachers and pupils were already beyond the region of nncertainty, and 
were only strengthened in their determination to make the plan a success. So far 
were they from fearing failure, that they requested me to make the examination 
thorough and public, and as far as possible oral, so that the people could see and 
hear for themselves. Unwilling to assume a responsibility of conducting those 
examinations without aid, I secured the services of Prof. H. L. Cox, principal of the 
Morgantown graded school, Prof. W. R. White, ex-State superintendent of free 
schools of West Virginia, and Professors Lyon, Purington, and Owen, of the West 
Virginia University. I gave notice through the press that oue or more of these pro- 
fessors would be present to aid me in each examination, and to deliver an appropri- 
ate address in the evening. 
“The county superintendent, each evening, after the addresses were ended, in the 
presence of the audience, delivered to each member of the class who was adjudged 
worthy of the same a common school diploma. Two hundred and sixty-one pupils 
had entered the class of 1876, and of this number 196 had completed the course and 
received diplomas. 
“Seven examinations were held in the seven country districts of the county, and 
with a single exception the largest churches of the several districts were insufficient 
to accommodate even during the day the vast numbers who came to witness the 
examinations. And these were not disinterested spectators; they were our most 
intelligent people—the cream of society, men and women who had sons or daugh- 
ters, or grandchildren, or friends in the class in whom they were deeply interested.” 
In his annual report of 1877 County Superintendent Wade says: ‘I organized in 
each district of the county an alumni association for the benefit of those who had 
graduated, and gave due notice through the press of the time and place of each 
meeting. The exercises in each of these meetings consisted of original and select 
orations, essays, and select readings. No public meetings pertaining to our free 
school work have elicited more interest or attracted larger crowds than these. In 
order to secure a permanent organization of the alumni of each district I provided 
ballots, and held an election at each meeting for a president, vice-president, and sec- 
retary. A gentleman to deliver an oration and a lady to read an essay at the district 
examination were also chosen by ballot. These were also elected by the members 
of the alumni association from its own body.    
 
-P-A-G-E-477
WEST VIRGINIA. ~ 1693 
  “From the reports of our first annual district alumni meetings it appears that 
more than eighty of the members of the class of 1876 embraced the opportunity to 
speak and read in the presence of large audiences, 
‘Our annual district examinations for the graduating class of 1877 were held at 
the end of the school term, and 110 pupils completed the course and obtained diplomas. 
It was not expected that the class in the county this year would be as large as it was 
last year, as we had last year the creanrproduced by several years’ work, Many per- 
sons at the close of the examinations in 1876 were of the opinion that in order to have 
graduates in 1877 it would be necessary to use ‘skimmed milk.’ Many of these, how- 
ever, after witnessing the examinations of the classes of 1877 agreed that the gradu- 
ates of this year are richer than last. The attendance upon these examinations both 
day and night, and the interest manifested by the masses in them, were quite equal 
to last year.” 
In reading the account of the operations of this system by its anthor, it is eviaent 
that the motive power of the entire scheme was found in the awakening of a great 
and genuine interest in the country district school among the people who depend on 
itfor the education of their own children, by whomit must be supported, and on whose 
efficient supervision its success depends. Any well-instructed school man or woman 
knows that while the ordinary country district school is the last place that would be 
often visited by any large number of people in search of entertainment or from any 
motive than astern sense of duty, there is yet no American institution which can be 
made so attractive to all sensible people and become such a notable center of the 
higher life of an entire community. Through the entire term of office of County 
Superintendent Wade this condition of affairs made Monongalia County the educa- 
tional light-house of the State. During the year 1876 this indefatigable school offi- 
cial, in his own modest language concerning the important feature of graduation, 
made this report of progress: 
“T visited every school in the county, spending usually a morning or an afternoon 
in each; noting in my journal the name of the school, the number of pupils entitled 
to attend, number on teachers’ roll, daily average attendance, branches taught, and 
the number of pupils studying each branch. I made it a point, as far as possible, to 
become acquainted personally with each pupil in the school, and to ascertain what 
branches were pursued by each. In order to bring together all interested parties, 
teachers, parents, and pupils, for the consideration of matters pertaining to the 
schools visited during the day, and for the consideration of questions relating to the 
free school interest generally, we held each evening an educational meeting. In 
these meetings I was aided by representative men, friends of free schools, professors 
in the university, teachers, ministers, physicians, farmers, and mechanics. I held 43 
of these educational mass meetings in the county, 27 in churches, 15 in school- 
houses, and 1 at a private residence. In addition to the addresses which were 
delivered, we had each evening the best music which the community could produce.” 
Of course, a scheme like this depends for its efficiency on so many conditions that 
it would almost be a miracle if it were found to work without a great deal of friction 
in the most thoroughly organized and interested school community in the Republic. 
Without a corps of instructors able to comprehend and administer the plan; able 
and earnest local trustees to encourage and aid the workers; a capable county super- 
intendent to stand as a wall of defense between every faithful progressive instructor 
and the inevitable resistance, nagging, and indifference in every school district; and, 
below all, the strong and watchful backing of the educational public of the com- 
munity, even a scheme so well wrought out as this will only be another interesting 
addition to the school literature of a community, with the usual ‘awful chasm” 
between every scripture and the actual life of mankind. Still, it was a great thing 
that such a movement should be made; especially honorable to the State of West 
Virginia, not only that one of her own citizens should have been its author, but that 
the body of superior educators and the State Jegislature should have so cordially 
cooperated with it; and that the present over-earnest, hard-working State superin- 
tendent of free schools, Hon. Virgil A. Lewis, should be wearing out his life in pro- 
claiming its merits and trying to enforce its better administration through the length 
and breadth of his splendid diocese of 24,715 square miles of ‘‘ West Virginia hills.” 
As a result of the labor and time expended on this organization of popular educa- 
tion in West Virginia during the past thirty years, we may point to the statement of 
the last report at hand, 1892, made by Supt. B. 8. Morgan. 
In 1892 the State had 4,866 subschool districts.. There were 5,004 schoolhouses, 
of which 836 were log, 4,022 frame, and 140 brick or stone; 2,497 containing improved 
desks; 1,649 with apparatus, and 5,644 volumes in school libraries. The value of 
school property was $2,135,566, an increase of nearly half a million dollars in 
one year, including furniture and supplies, making an investment by the State of 
$2,746,234 in the great business of public education. Between 6 and 16 years of age 
there were enumerated 206,222 children and youth of legal school age, only 8,529 of 
the colored race, Besides this army of the children, there were 71,076 youth between 
     
-P-A-G-E-478
  1694 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
the ages of 16 and 21, making an aggregate of 276,452 subjects of school instruction 
and discipline below the age of complete citizenship. Of these, 200,789 were enrolled 
in the public schools, 30,000 being 16 years of age and upward, with an average daily 
attendance of 128,044. It is encouraging to Jearn that of all this great army of 
nearly 300,000 wide-awakes only 14,639 underwent the time-honored discipline of a 
thrashing, and but 413 were suspended and dismissed for disorderly conduct. The 
average age of the pupils was 11.01; confirming the very serious fact that the aver- 
age American child leaves school at 12 years of age or thereabouts. 
Five thousand seven hundred and forty-seven teachers, of whom 726 had taught 
ten years or more, 1,042 five, 2,153 less than five years, presided over this crowd of 
young Americans, receiving according to their grades of certificates from $32.30 to 
$19.89 per month for an average school session of five months and ten days. For 
the training of these teachers the State has established 6 normal schools, in 1892 
containing 1,015 pupils, of whom only 72 were graduated. Fifty-six teachers’ insti- 
tutes were held, in which 5,571, nearly the entire body, were instructed during the 
summer months. Of these 5,167 schools, only 17 were high, 145 graded, and 5,005 of 
the ordinary rural or village sort. We read that, during five years, these schools 
received 25,000 visits from school officials, 25,000 more from parents, and 60,000 from 
“other persons.” 
For tho support of this great educational department of the Government, the 
State, in 1892, had a school fund of $347,617.49. It received by a railroad tax 
$54,730, and some $20,000 from other sources. The whole sum expended on the 5,000 
teachers was $1,073,764.70. The receipts for building expenses were $685,247.23. 
The sum of all receipts for public education was $1,758,011.93, and the disburse- 
ments $1,436,062.53; a per capita expenditure of $10.25 for ‘average daily attend- 
ance,” and $5.16 for “‘enumeration.” The average rate of taxation was 34.84 cents 
on $100 for the support of teachers, and 25.60 cents for building. The valuation of 
property subject to taxation in West Virginia in 1892 was $217,352,729.64. The Stato 
received from the Peabody Education Fund for the training of teachers in the Pea- 
body Normal School at Nashville, Tenn., and for normal schools and institutes at 
home, $3,500. The number of students in attendance at the State University in 1892 
was 224, of whom 31 were graduated. This institution until recently was withouta 
president. West Virginia, in comparison with the majority of Southern States, is not 
well supplied with collegiate and academic schools of the private, corporate, and 
denominational type. Bethany College, coeducational, is the chief of the denomi- 
national seats of the higher education, having matriculated 5,000 and graduated 730 
students, and is now a more valuable institution than at any period of its history. 
West Virginia College, Broadus College, the West Virginia Normal and Classical 
Academy, the West Virginia Conference Seminary, Salem College, Shelton College, 
Barboursvillo College, St. Vincent (Catholic) College (the term “college” in these 
schools representing what is commonly understood by the title in the South), with 
perhaps a dozen secondary schools, complete the list that appears in the report of 
the State superintendent for 1891-92. 
In comparison with the 16 States once known as slaveholding and still named as 
“Southern,” West Virginia, educationally, occupies a most honorable position. 
Only 6 of these—Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, and Tennessee— 
according to the report of the National Bureau of Education, expended a largersum 
for schools in 1890-91. The mother Virginia, for common school education, exceeded 
her youngest daughter by only $200,000. The ‘‘Empire State of the South,” Georgia, 
with more than $100,000,000 additional property valuation and more than twice the 
population, fell below West Virginia in that year almost an equalsum. Compared 
with the Northern States, the most intelligent comparison would seem to be found 
in the State of Maine. With a smaller population, but with $100,000,000 additional 
valuation, the ‘Pine Tree State” expended in 1890-91 almost the same amount as 
the ‘Commonwealth of the Mountains” for the children. All conditions and cir- 
cumstances taken into account, favorable and unfavorable, it may without exagger- 
tion be asserted that no American State, within the past thirty years, has so 
distinguished itself by the zealous, intelligent, and progressive spirit of its people 
in the great causo of universal education as West Virginia. Well may the citizens of 
this Commonwealth, amid all the discouragements of the present troubled years, 
take heart for themselves and call upon the American people, in the Psalmist’s 
words of encouragement and good cheer, to “lift up their eyes unto the hills from 
whence cometh strength.” : 
Such was the condition of public education in West Virginia in 1892, The two 
years intervening between the last published report of the State superintendent of 
education and my own visit were doubtless characterized by the usual degree of 
steady progress, of which I took cognizance. The request to offer suggestions in 
regard to the future development of the common schools, of a State that has hitherto 
seemed to get on very well with little ‘aid and comfort” from without, is certainly 
a compliment no man should fail to appreciate. If I comply with this proposition  
-P-A-G-E-479
WEST VIRGINIA. 1695 
  and, in the remainder of this essay, put forward a few suggestions for the further 
development of the vigorous system now on the ground, it will be rather to empha- 
size the almost unanimous opinion of the foremost practical educators of the State, 
both as expressed to myself and as set forth in numerous public appeals to the peo- 
ple. Indeed, in the last report of the State educational department, in 1891-92, 
several of these points were so fully presented and forcibly urged that it would seem 
a useless repetition to refer to them, Still, I am aware that the testimony of a 
stranger, who comes after a careful survey of education in all the States of the South, 
free from all entanglements, local and State, may be of use in calling tho attention of 
the educational public to what their own educators are writing and saying; and may 
possibly show, by comparison with the policy of other States, North and South, the 
importance of certain lines of operation that seem not yet to have awakened a wide- 
spread discussion among the people and in the legislature. Iam alsoaware that the 
chief deficiencies in the school teaching of West Virginia are paralleled even in the 
great adjacent Commonwealths of Ohio and Pennsylvania; also in the States that 
justly claim to have been the birthplace of the American common school. Itis always 
in order, on every fit occasion, to stir up the intelligent people of city or country to 
the great defects in the administration of our American system of universal educa- 
tion; especially as nothing is needed for a beneficent reformation but an instructed 
and resolute public opinion that will persist in every useful experiment, despite “the 
shrieks of locality,” or any of the familiar methods of arresting the progress of a 
national reform. 
The first and last thing that attracted my attention during my visit to West 
Virginia was, that the great success in the organization and development of public 
education of which I have spoken has been due to a widespread determination and 
enthusiastic purpose among large numbers of the people of the State rather than 
the prominent leadership of “ great educators.” I have no disposition to ignore the 
services of the able teachers of both sexes, the educational statesmen and the 
leaders of public opinion, who have been conspicuous figures in this great work 
during the past thirty years. But West Virginia has not yet given to the country 
a great educational organizer or philesopher like Mann, Barnard, Curry, Sears, 
Harris, and others of only less influence. This fact I regard as of the highest impor- 
tance in considering the advancement on the lines of the present success. Napoleon 
said, “‘When you want to move forward, let alone the leaders and go direct to the 
people.” The one condition even of keeping the American common school up to its 
present estate of efficiency, not to say of inaugurating necessary and difficult 
reforms, is that the people whose children are educated therein and who pay for 
and, through their representative, superintend its management, shall be kept well 
informed, alive and alert, resolute to demand and insist on what is found to be nec- 
essary to efficiency at any time, place, or under any peculiar condition. 
There is always a practical organization; especially of the abler educators of the 
secondary and higher departments of public, private, and parochial education; 
which is in possession of the leading press of the country and is always discussing 
with great learning and zeal every feature of the American system of schooling for 
American citizenship. This is as it should be. But no greater misfortune could 
befall any State than that the decision of such a professional body should be final, 
and the people’s schools molded and administered according to the administration 
or suggestion of any “committee of ten” or combination of great educators. Just 
as the people of the United States can not afford to leave the Government, the church, 
or any matter of unusual interest to the sole charge of the clergy, the statesmen, or 
any professional clique or guild, however eminent, so especially must that portion 
of the people known as the educational public of every State keep its eye on the 
compass and its hand on the helm if the schools are to be worked for the children, 
rather than the children used to illustrate brilliant educational theories and glorify 
the experts. 
The school system of West Virginia was, at first, forced upon the State as a result 
of the long, patient waiting of the best-informed and most practical people in the 
country for some effective method of educating the children and youth of their new 
Commonwealth. It has been brought up to its present estate by the continuance of 
this lively public interest. The educational worker, coming like myself into the 
State, at once feels the presence of a strong and sensitive public opinion in all mat- 
ters connected with this supreme interest of the people. Nowhere, in a career of 
fifteen years, which has led me through every State of the South, have I found 
myself face to face with an educational public that so challenged the uttermost of 
information, wisdom, discretion, and experience in every utterance; so responsive to 
“all progressive suggestions; so intolerant of sham and pretense, though indorsed 
by the most respectable authorities. It will be a great blessing if this high-water 
mark of public interest can be continued for a generation to come. 
West Virginia has before it a destiny in the development of its vast resources 
which can only be realized by the education of its 300,000 children and youth of the

  present up to a full appreciation of their home opportunities and obligations. No 
service to education can be so important for the next twenty years as the constant 
discussion of timely educational topics before the people by the ablest men and 
women of every profession, at home and from abroad. ‘The thoughtful teacher who 
is longing for some outlet from the monotonous path which he is compelled to tread 
will do well to go direct to the people through the press and by speech, and tell them 
“where the shoe pinches,” and what should be done for present relief. But, after 
all, the teachers of a State, however excellent, are only one of a half a dozen pro- 
fessions; probably neither better nor worse than similar professional bodies. No 
500,000 schoolmasters and schoolmistresses can assume to be the final judges and 
administrators of the training of 20,000,000 of American children and youth for the 
loftiest position on earth, American citizenship. And if the discouraged and exas- 
perated teacher has come to distrust and fear the power of the educational charlatan 
and political demagogue over the popular mind, he should remember that it is not 
by concentrating this fundamental interest of the people in the hands of a profes- 
sional ‘‘ring,” but rather by spreading far and wide the best information on this 
subject of supreme interest, that the educational public of every community may 
be lifted above the peril of falling into the power of a mischievous and ignorant 
leadership. 
Every young graduate of a college or a normal school in West Virginia; every 
young lawyer and aspirant for public office, especially every clergyman, journalist, 
man of affairs, or intelligent workman; every ambitious West Virginia girl should 
give diligent and persistent study to the subject of common school instruction in 
the State, and on all suitable occasions, in clubs, in popular gatherings, in the 
schoolhouses, in sermons, through the press, and by the most radical educational 
influence, conversation, seek to enlighten and confirm the public opinion on which 
all good things depend. 
There are States of this Union where a group of educators, among the most 
enlightened and zealous of the country, year in and year out, have gone up to the 
legislature with the most rational suggestions for reform in common school affairs, 
only to be repulsed, neglected, snubbed, and sent home to their old work of ‘‘mak- 
ing bricks without straw,” bailing out the ocean with a sieve, or sweeping out the 
tidal wave of illiteracy with ahand broom. But this condition is somewhat their 
own fault. Too often the public gatherings of the leaders of educational thought 
have been little more than an interchange of pleasant courtesies between a club of 
pedagogues; or the precious hours have been wasted in a useless wrangle over petty 
details of everyday school work, with no recognition of or appeal to the people to 
whose good will they are indebted for the very existence of this great interest they 
so belittle through their narrow professional policy. It is not because the people of 
West Virginia have been derelict, but because they stand at the head of all the 
South in an awakened and sensitive condition of opinion, that we urge them ‘not 
to be weary in welldoing,” to maintain and increase their interest in this momentous 
agency of universal education, and to keep in their own hands its future adminis— 
tration, as during the fruitful years of the past. 
Second. It is worthy of notice that the most original work yet inaugurated by the 
schoolmen of West Virginia, the movement for the grading and graduation of com- 
mon district schools, came up in the line of what has just been said. It was the 
rare popular instinct of County Superintendent Wade in awakening the interest of 
the parents and the general public to the schools that furnished a moyement-power 
behind his plan, without which it would have been only another abortive suggestion 
for the reform of a great defect. Under the kindly and wise cooperation of the 
leading educators of the State, the present course of study and graduation has been 
elaborated and made compulsory in every country and village school. 
But, having done this, the decisive question comes up, Can this excellent plan for 
the proper organization and administration of the schools in which nine-tenths of 
the children of West Virginia are educated be enforced in any but the most per- 
functory and useless way? Unless the teachers of the State, at least 4,500 of the 
5,000 of whom are at work in the country and village schoolhouse, are superior to 
the similar class in this portion of the Union, it will be an endless task to engineer 
this scheme, ending in disappointment, disgust, and a final ‘‘throwing up of the 
hands,” with a lapse back into the old shiftless and wasteful habits. Hence a pri- 
mary necessity of the present educational situation in the State would seem to be 
the concentration of the entire interest of the educational public on the better 
building up and extension of the arrangements for the training of teachers, espe- 
cially for the country schools. 
A dozen or two cities and larger villages of the Commonwealth were found not ° 
behind similar communities in other States in this respect. In several of the older 
cities there has been developed a quite remarkable group of faithful and successful 
home instructors in all grades. But we would urge the speedy establishment of a 
proper department for the training of teachers in every community of sufficient pop-

  ulation and importance to support a good high school. In every high school are 
found several young people who are looking forward to the occupation of teaching. 
It is a prodigious waste of time and energy, as is so often done, to shoot the young 
graduate into the most responsible position of primary instruction ; leaving the poor 
girl to run the fearful gauntlet that a crowd of fifty young children must be to any- 
body who is placed in authority over them, with no previous training. No superin- 
tendent can successfully train a corps of young teachers while overburdened with 
work, No superintendent can ‘‘keep school” over the head of the room teacher. 
In many of the larger schoolhouses in these towns we found the practice, almost 
universal in the South, of appointing a woman as nominal principal; holding her 
responsible for the school in a somewhat indefinite way, while giving her no time 
or opportunity in school hours to supervise or even know what is going on in her 
diocese. All this is wasteful and accounts for a great deal of the failure in the 
working of the educational system. The principal of every school, however small, 
should have the time and opportunity to overlook the work and direct with a firm 
hand the going on of the tem. This can be done by an arrangement for a 
“teacher at large” in the school; or even by the daily consolidation of certain 
classes of pupils for gencral instruction. There are plenty of ways of doing it, if 
one sets about it with a determined spirit. 
The superintendent of a graded school system often dissipates his power and de- 
prives the community of his best services by giving up altogether the work of teach- 
ing. Of course, where a city can afford to place a competent master at the head of its 
high school, it will be best. But, in many of the smaller cities and larger villages 
of a State like West Virginia, the superintendent of schools is or should be the ablest 
teacher of the entire group. And he should be known as the real head of the high- 
school department, giving a portion of every day to recitations which bring the 
entire body of students under his immediate charge. Only in this way will this class 
of high schools be rescued from the condition in which they are so often stranded, a 
sort of upper-story school club, largely composed of young girls, presided over by a 
cultivated woman, gravitating to a sentimental and inefficient habit of trifling with 
ornamentals and meandering through ‘green pastures” and lingering ‘beside still 
waters,” along “the lines of least resistance,” shunned by the more energetic boys, 
who prefer to be ‘‘ where something is going on.” Almost every village of 2,000, or 
even 1,000, substantial people in the State, could have a high school department thus 
presided over by the superintendent of schools. His supervision of the primary and 
grammar grades will be all the more valuable because he is learning, up at the top 
of the system, what has been neglected or poorly done down below. 
And the superintendent, or his most efficient assistant, should be put at the head 
of a department of instruction in every graded school, to give all who are proposing 
to teach a thorough course of study on the general subject of school keeping, with 
arrangements for observation and practice. This will, at least, do for the pupil what 
every professional school is expected to do for its students, somewhat reduce the ter- 
rible risk of letting loose a young man as doctor, lawyer, minister, upon a dependent 
community, in absolute ignorance of the to be done. 
I shali certainly not be accused of the failure to appreciate the rare and subtle 
power of a cultivated and trained womanhood in all positions of influence in public 
education. But Iam more and more compelled to believe that one of the chief defects 
of our American common school keeping to-day is in the careless and reckless habit 
of filling our schoolrooms in city and country with a crowd of young girls; often 
destitute of knowledge, mental and moral training, or experience in life; suddenly 
projected, as from a tremendous propelling machine, from a course of study that has 
shut them up for ten years to a wearisome round of learning and reciting lessons; 
often without the usual experience in taking care of children which the daughter 
who is taken out of school for home work enjoys. The way is so clear to a reform in 
this respect in all cities and large villages that it would seem to be a matter of course 
that there should be established a department of pedagogy, as an indispensable 
feature of every graded school. 
The State of West Virginia, according to its circumstances and conditions, during 
the past thirty years, has done an excellent service in the establishment 0 normal 
schools for the training at pre: of 1,000 candidates for the office of teacher. It 
is ‘now the accepted time” to take another forward step in the direction of enabling 
these schools to do the proper work for which they were intended. The chronic 
weakness of the State normal school everywhere is the fact that it is thronged with 
young people, largely girls, who come with neither academical nor any other fitness 
to receive the professional training which is the only excuse for the public support 
of this class of seminaries. It is not too much to say that, in nine-tenths of this 
class of schools in the country, the great emphasis of the instruction must be laid 
on the teaching the majority of theso youths the common branches they are expected 
to handle. Of course, if this instruction is by experts, and in accordance with the 
best methods, it is a great improvement on the ordinary routine of the private

academy or high school. But I only state the plain fact, that the State normal 
schools are now everywhere under fire, and are being ‘put upon their mettle” as: 
never before. In Massachusetts, the State that first inaugurated the system more 
than half a century ago, and already supports six normal schools and a score of city 
training schools not inferior t in the country, the legislature, at the last. ses- 
sion, resolved to set up four additional seminaries; with the stern proviso that, after 
1895, an education equivalent to a high school graduation shall be the imperative 
condition of admission to all. Whether this law can be enforced, even in a State 
that has made provision that every child in the Commonwealth shall have the opper- 
tunity of a high school education at public expense, is a question. Butit isa move 
in the right direction, and indicates the upward trend of the road along which the 
young American teacher must now travel if ambitions of succes: 
In the three normal schools visited in my late tour in West Virginia, I found a 
remarkable efficiency in the teaching force. I did not see an indifferent or inefficient 
teacher among al! those employed. But, even in the largest and most thoroughly 
developed of all, the school at Fairmont, I found a serious defect in the lack of 
good previous academical training in many of the pupils. I can well appreciate the 
dearth of home opportunities that sends so many of these young girls and boys up 
to the State normal school to learn even the ‘‘three R’s” in any way that would 
qualify them to teach in the humblest school. But all the more should the State 
labor to produce some method by which not a more earnest and faithful, but a 
better prepared body of students can be obtained. I say this, assuming that the 
scheols I visited were a fair representative of the remaining three I hope, at some 
future time, to see. Iam aware that this must everywhere be a difficult operation; 
to lift up the ground floor of all these schools. But the sense of the impertance of the 
- work is the first condition of success. It will be found a practical impossibility to 
work thesystem of grading and graduation in the country schools now proposed with- 
out such a-decided uplift of the average teaching force in the rural districts as can 
only be secured by a bold pushing to the front of all institutions of this class. 
One thing ean be accomplished, and it would greatly relieve the strain in all these 
schools. An arrangement can be made with the local public schools of every city 
and village in which a State normal is located for such a cooperative organization as 
will enable these public schools to be, in a certain degree, under the supervision of 
the normal school authorities; their teachers chosen from the best of the graduates; 
their classes.utilized for the observation and practice of the upper grades of stu- 
dents, with equaladvantage to the children and the pupil teachers. <A little “model 
school,” patched up from such an odd lot of children as can be gathered outside the 
public school, is only a farce. Every State normal school should be in vital contact 
with the entire system of public instruction in the community where it is located, 
and in all possible ways should aid and be aided by the arrangement. In this way 
the public schools of these towns, instead of being inferior, living in astate of petty 
jealousy of the normal, would become the notable centers of education in the county. 
Good families would remove there to educate their children, and the village people, 
instead of giving themselves up to a miserable ‘‘nagging” of the State institution, 
would consult its own profit in all ways by cheerful cooperation. By this arrange- 
ment every graduate from the State normal will go forth with twice the ability to 
assume the work in the country schoolrocm. 
The State University, Bethany College, and every considerable secondary school, 
public, private, or denominational, should at once establish a vigorous department 
of pedagogies for the training of its young graduates. It is high time that the 
scandal of sending forth the college boy or the seminary girl, absolutely ignorant of 
the history or meaning of the great profession they so confidently invade, in the 
language of the Apostle, ‘Not knowing whether there be a Holy Ghost,” to occupy 
the most responsible positions of instruction in the most important seminaries 
should cease. This crude, provincial, clumsy way of operation might have been 
winked at half a century ago, but the school life of to-day demands that all higher 
seminaries make the experiment of a class of pedagogy; give to this department 
every opportunity for ‘‘thorough” study; form acombination with the public school 
of the neighborhood for observation and practice, and in every way prepare the 
graduate for the work to which he may be called. 
Of the institute work, so vigorously carried on in the State, it can only be said 
that this is for the improvement of teachers already in harness. The fundamental 
and imperative duty of the State, for many years to come, shoula be the preparation 
of a better class of material and a more thorough training for the mass of teachers 
of country schools. I have great faith in a people that has done so much as in West 
Virginia, in a time so short, for the children. I believe the Commonwealth will 
respond to the awakening demand of the most reliable educators for an enlargement 
and a deepening of this, the very soul of the educational activity of the State. 
Third. The late State superintendent of free schools, Mr. B. 8S. Morgan, earnestly 
calls attention to the lack of provision for secondary education in the arrangement     
  
   
-P-A-G-E-483
  WEST VIRGINIA. 1699 
of the public school system and suggests a plan for relief in this direction. It is 
evident that hero is the weakest link in the educational chain of the Mountain 
State. If it be true that in 1892 there were but 17 free high schools for the 200,000 
children and youth of the State, only 5 of these maintaining a three years’ 
course, ‘the other 12 comprising the higher grades in graded schools, the amount 
of work being quite limited and irregular,” and that “only 11 per cent of the school 
population of the State enjoy the advantages of high school instruction, there is 
evidently 2 loud call for a movement in this direction. This deprivation is all the 
more felt by reason of the comparatively smatl number of reliable academies in 
West Virginia; which, in this respect, seems to lag behind all the States of the 
South. It is difficult for an outside observer to understand why the prosperous 
city of Wheeling, foremost in the days “before the flood” in the organization of 
public schools, should still “linger shivering on the brink and fear to launch away” 
in. the establishment of a high school that would be a model and inspiration to the 
Commonwealth. The admirable service of the superintendent and able principals 
of the several grammar schools of that-city in caring for the higher grades in these 
buildings seems to have persuaded the educational public to let them go on indefi- 
nitely trying to perform this double duty. But sooner or later, despite the most 
conscientious service of teachers in the primary and grammar grades, a school sys- 
tem bereft of its proper arrangement for the secondary education will become like 
the fabled tribe of men who go about “carrying their own heads under their arms.” 
God created the head to rise above the shoulders, and the idea of an educational 
system that has not the high school in a community able to bear its expense, is sup- 
plying one illustration more of the favorite doctrine of the small politician, knock- 
ing out the brains of things to save money, The feet donot move the head, but 
the head moves the feet, is 2 maxim as true in the common school as in physiology. 
Withont an effective head, any common school system inevitably falls under popular 
disrepute, as an inefficient arrangement that looks up to another and a radically 
different system to piece out its work. ‘The State of Massachusetts has followed out 
the irresistible logic of the common school idea by making the support of a high 
school, with a classical department of forty weeks, compulsory on all places of a 
certain population and valuation; and of an English high school in all towns of a 
certain lower standard, with the provision than any one of its 350 towns not included 
in these two classes may, by vote in town meeting, establish a school of the same 
grade. By the act of the legislature in the past season, every town in the State is 
now compelled to pay tuition for the high school instruction of all its children who 
may require and are prepared for it. 
Of course, no State of the type of West Virginia, with a people so dispersed over 
a wide area, and few towns of sufficient size and valuation to support a proper high 
school, can expect to adopt a system of this sort. ‘This deprivation of many of the 
children of the Southern States of high school opportunities is one of the chief dis- 
abilities of their educational system. We have always hoped to see in these States 
a fair trial of the support of a proper free high school by each county, in which “all 
youth of suitable acquirements could be educated. Established at the county town, 
with a department for instruction in pedagogics and arrangements for industrial 
training, it would easily become the most attractive institution in the county, and 
be a constant stimulant to the entire system of rural district instruction. Especially 
in West Virginia, where the present system of grading and graduation for country 
schools isin operation, it would be practicable, and place the State in the front rank 
of educational Commonwealths. The proper way to begin would be for some enter- 
prising county to try the experiment. One year’s success, and with proper manage- 
ment there need be no failure, would put the movement on wheels and send it 
“Pooming” up and down the State. 
Meanwhile, as already suggested, it behooves the cities and districts that attempt 
to sustain a public high school to make it so efticient that it will attract a larger 
number of pupils. One of the most serious features of the school life of the South is 
the small number of boys over 15 years of age found in the schoolroom. One reason, 
we believe, is the weariness and disgust of the average boy at a great deal of the 
“ fooling” in the lower grades, from the inexperience and weakness of the teachers. 
Long before he reaches the perilous age of 14 this youngster has a very definite idea 
that he will get out of that sort of life as soon as may be. Buta good high school, 
resided over by a competent man or an exceptional woman, will be an elevator to 
ift up large numbers of boys who need especially that superior school training 
between the years of 14 and 18 which will tell on their entire future life. The 
chronic defect of the present Eng system of public instruction, established the 
same year as the public schools in Virginia, is that it can not obtain Parliamentary 
aid above the elementary grades. As a consequence, it is regularly avoided by the 
“middle class,” and remains, with all its undeniable merits, a school for the poor. 
It is not well that a State that thirty years ago cast in its lot with the new Ameri- 
can ideal of public and private life, should linger longer in the cold shadow cast 
across the ocean by the conservatism of the mother land.

Fourth. It is not remarkable that the system of county supervision, as now prac- 
ticed or rather endured by all the Southern and the majority of the Northern States, 
should be a fit target for the criticism of every superior educator; and that the State 
Educational Association of West Virginia, two years ago, should have entered a 
vigorous protest against the farce to which it so often degenerates. I believe, in this 
respect, this State is better served than the majority of the Commonwealths of the 
section. Inmore than one of these States, the system has become a dry rot at the cen- 
ter of every county organization of public instruction, costing the State, by the fail- 
ure of educational results, a hundred fold of what is saved by the pitiable economy 
that keeps it in its present almost useless condition. But when we are told, in the 
report of the State superintendent of West Virginia, in 1892, that for the salary of 
$300 even this State demands an amount and quality of work from a county super- 
intendent for which an educational expert, worth $3,000 a year in any market, is 
needed, we can appreciate the remark of crusty old Dr. Johnson, in reply to the 
chronic domestic wail over the servant-girl question: “‘You can’t expect all the 
Christian virtues for three and sixpence a week.” In a former essay on education in 
southwest Virginia, where a similar condition of affairs exists, we suggested that a 
change to a system of district supervision by a competent educator, man or woman, 
with an ample salary and provision for traveling expenses, would be a great advan- 
tage to the schools, with a far more efficient oversight of the local officials for atten- 
tion to routine duty. With greater care, by the districts, concerning the election or, 
in States where they are not elected, the appointment of local trustees, there would 
be no special difficulty by this method in handling a large district in a way far more 
effective than at present. A strong man or woman, wholly devoted to this work of 
supervision, with the local authorities in active cooperation, can far more easily super- 
vise the educational affairs of several counties than is possible with the meager pro- 
visions of the presentlaw. We are convinced that this arrangement must eventually 
come; and when it does, the State will for the first time reap the full benefit of its 
system of common schools. 
Fifth. In‘%®ur observation of public educational affairs through the sixteen States 
usually classed as Southern, we have had frequent occasion to deplore the popular 
prejudice against the State university, which has led several of them to insist ona 
separation of the State and agricultural and mechanical colleges. Within a few 
years both the Carolinas have thus divided their resources. Texas, Virginia, Ala- 
bama, and Mis: ppi have already gone and done likewise. Only in Kentucky, 
Missouri, Tennessee, Arkansas, Maryland, Delaware, and West Virginia, and partially 
in Georgia and Florida, has the united university system been fairly tested, and even 
there without the full success it deserves. The responsibility for this separation of 
what should be married together in the higher education is about equally shared 
between a class of representatives of the higher education and the leaders of the 
rising “ People’s Party” in public affairs. It can not be denied that, in too many 
cases, the establishment of an industrial department in the State university has been 
stoutly resisted by the extreme advocates of the old-time classical college, and, 
when the arrangement has been forced upon them by the establishment of the agri- 
cultural and mechanical department, the annex has received a persistent “cold 
shoulder.” 
Of course, this has justly excited the indignation of a large number of intelligent 
people, who expected much from the national bounty in this direction; and the feel- 
ing thus awakened has in more than one case resulted in the separation of the State 
university into two rival institutions, with no connection; with an ill-concealed 
assumption of superiority by the older and regular foundation. With the exception 
of Virginia, Texas and possibly Alabama, none of these States which have yielded 
to this pressure has shown itself able to support both these institutions in a way 
sufficiently generous to place them alongside the colleges and universities of many 
other States. In some instances the original State university has been so crippled 
that its usefulness has been greatly impaired. Meanwhile the agricultural college 
has usually been, in its academical department, at best a secondary high school; the 
majority of its students a throng of youths, neither fitted for college life nor qualitied 
for such expert industrial training as they would be able to offer. The military 
arrangement seems often to have made the school a refuge for a large contingent of 
“bad boys,” whose parents are glad to throw upon the State a responsibility that 
has become a burden to themselves. 
But the tendency of all superior American university life, at present, is to include 
in its broad circle all that is really feasible in a rational scheme of college training. 
The most efficient university foundations in. the States west of the Alleghanies are 
Washington University, in St. Louis, Mo.; Leland Stanford, in California; and Tulane 
University, New Orleans, La. All these include a department of technology, with a 
system of manual training, industrial drawing, and ornamental art culture in their 
curriculum. There would be no special difficulty in adding to these a proper school 
of instruction in scientific agriculture, with such experiments as'may be profitable 
for this class of students, 
      
     
     
   
-P-A-G-E-485
  WEST VIRGINIA. 1701 
It appeared to me, in the few days I was permitted to enjoy the delightful hospi- 
tality of the university and the citizens of Morgantown, that West Virginia is now 
in a fair way of including in its State University the best results of the modern 
experiment of combining in the circle of the higher education all the applications 
of science to industrial life. With the arrangement of its academical faculties for 
all departments of culture; its superb situation; its admission of women to univer- 
sity opportunities; its interesting experimenting in a department of pedagogy; the 
rapid development of its departments.of agriculture and mechanics; and its good 
work in other directions; there wonld seem to be in its organization a safeguard 
against any popular upheaval which would separate and thusd dissipate the moderate 
resources of the State. With the gradual development of the secondary education 
and the increase of fit preparatory schools, there should be no reason for the neglect 
to secure the correlation of all public and a fr iendly relation with all superior 
private schools which will make for the greatest good of the Commonwealth. 
Sixth. Ninety of every one hundred men and women who have graduated even from 
superior schools never return to thorough study after their graduation, save in the 
direction of their own apation or profession, but depend on reading for their entire 
mental growth as far asitis derived from books. The crying need of the entire South- 
ern section of our country, as I have observed it during the past fifteen years, is 
the lack of good reading matter to supplement the instruction in the schools. It is 
almost incredible that, through entire sections of the country, outside of occasional 
private collections, this dearth of opportunity for good reading should be so marked. 
‘The inevitable result of the absence of good reading is the coming in of the deluge 
of weak, mischievous, and often abominable matter, that makes a thoughtful man 
almost deny the value of learning to read at all. Every country railroad station or 
village news stand in the South is becoming a depot for this literary ‘ fodder,” 
which finds its physical parallel only among the unfortunate creatures represented 
as washing down a meal of dirt with a swash of moonshine whisky. In our late 
visit we were encouraged to find in several of the larger towns Nett cities of West 
Virginia the hopeful beginning of a public library; with collections of valuable 
reading matter in some of the larger public schools. But the great need is in the 
open country; and one of the first movements by the State legislature should be a 
law to encourage the formation of libraries in every school district, by an offer of a 
moderate State bounty conditioned on the effort of the people to help themselves in 
this way. The great revival of the common school in 1837-1848, under the leader- 
ship of Horace Mann, Henry Barnard, and like-minded reformers, was signalized by 
the effort to establish common school libraries in the leading States of the North, 
In Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio, and other States, this plan was carried out 
with a good measure of success. The library everywhere became one of the most 
powerful auxili s to the building up of an effective system of public instruction. 
To-day, in all the foremost centers of education in the Union, the public library has 
become a practical annex to the public school; the teachers using it to awaken and 
develop a correct taste for reading in their pupils with the happiest results. One of 
the results of this habit of making district school collections of good books in the 
open cquntry will be the final establishment of good frée circulating libraries in all 
considerable villages. Nothing will so conduce to the arrest of the present alarming 
depopulation of extensive country districts, by which the best young people are 
being swept away into the vortex of city or the chances of new village life, as the 
multiplication of good schools, libraries, and the means of good inexpensive educa- 
tion amid the surroundings of unspoiled nature; where the great open volume of 
the visible world is all the time supplementing the best work of the teacher in the 
schoolroom. 
Seventh. There remains but one further topic connected with the development of 
the common school in West Virginia to be considered; but that is so important that 
it might well have been treated at first, rather than at the close of this essay; were 
it not that industrial education can not be separated from the proper training of the 
schools without degenerating to that narrow teaching of a trade which gives us 
the mechanic without the furnishing of the man. In no State visited during our 
ministry of education in the South has there been found such an imperative necessity 
for a great organization of industrial education, in all classes, asin this and the cor- 
responding region of southwestern Virginia. - But in no States, deficient as are all 
the States of the South in this respect, is there so little apparent interest in this great 
subject as here. Outside the agricultural and mechanical departments of the State 
University, now first coming into prominence, and perhaps two or three schools for 
the whites, and the State school for colored youth, we saw little indication that the 
educational public had seriously considered the question. Even the very important 
subject of drawing in the public schools appeared to be handled with little regard 
to its bearing on industrial training and with no great degree of success, 
But surely, if this State is ever to realize her “ manifest destiny” amid her sister 
Commonwealths, it must be in the development of her prodigious resources in mineral 
    
          
  
         
 
-P-A-G-E-486
  1702 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
wealth, manufactures, and askilled agriculture. Fortunately, West Virginia has not 
yet been ravaged, as all the Atlantic and Gulf States of the South have been, by that 
wasteful style of farming which George Washington predicted, a century ago, would 
change Northern Virginia to the wilderness so much of it-is to-day. I is only by 
such a training as will bring to the front a generation, native to the State; a body 
of people competent to appreciate the great opportunities in her abundance of woods, 
the cultivation of grasses, grains, fruits, and garden crops, that the agricultural capa- 
bilities of Western Virginia can be fully developed. ‘The day has passed when any 
American State can ever again hold such political relations to the Union as Virginia 
maintained for half a century. No Commonwealth in the future can have that domi- 
nating public influence that Virginia, Kentue South Carolina, Ohio, New York, 
and Massachusetts have had at different periods of American history. Rapid transit 
is the death of local and even State superiority in such directions. It is now only 
by thesuperiority in the skilled industry which concentrates all the scientific research 
and knowledge of the day upon the improvement and enlargement of our human life 
that any State can hope to excel or even intain what has already been gained. 
Every feature of the country; every material deposit in mines, ‘‘ burning springs,” 
forest, or water power, calls aloud to the Mountain State to prepare for that coming 
of the Lord which, in the gospel of American life, means the fit development of the 
resources with which the God of nature has endowed the great mountain world, of 
which West Virginia is at present the head, and of which she may be the pioneer 
of a success impossible now to predict. 
The problem of industrial education in both the Virginias, especially in West Vir- 
ginia, to-day, is a plain statement of facts and a preparation for impending condi- 
tions. Within twenty years many thousands of skilled workmen and workwomen in 
all the varied industries that must be developed in States so favored by nature will be 
called for, with such opportunities for honorable success in life as have never been 
offered to the masses of their people before. The youth of this State are not inferior 
in any of the natural gifts that make the trained worker, the inventor, the super- 
visor of industries, the leader of those great industrial combinations that have built 
up tho civilization of the foremost States of the Union. Will the Commonwealth 
of West Virginia let slip the present opportunity to give to the present generation 
of her children and youth that training of the hand and development of executive 
faculty, without which the culture of the mind and even the development of right 
living may yet leave a people unfitted to face the opening opportunities and stern 
demands of the day and hour? If twenty years hence, perhaps earlier than that, 
this call finds no large response from the native youth of the State, the inevitable 
result will be that they will be crowded out of their own heritage; pushed onward 
toward the setting sun, to fill some gap of border civilization, and repeat the hard 
life of the fathers and mothers in settling another new country; while the young 
men and women of liberal commonwealths will come in and reap the harvest. 
It is not a year too early for the people of this Commonwealth to consider this 
matter. For whatever statesmen, not to say politicians, may affirm, this simple 
enterprise of developing the industrial faculty of a generation is a hundred{fold more 
important to the future destiny of an American State than the solution of the vexed 
problems that now agitate the American Congress and divide the great political par- 
ties into hostile armies, contending for the administration of the Government. For 
there is nothing that a generation of well-schooled, industrially trained American 
young men and women can not do in the line of the development of agriculture, man- 
ufactures, and commerce, even in the face of the disabilities of natural environment, 
the hindrance to prosperity from false economic ideas, and foolish legislation against 
the eternal laws of national development. 
Every considerable city in West Virginia should at once make haste to establish 
an industrial department in connection with its public schools, in which, at least, 
all who are disposed may have the opportunity to prepare for success in life. And 
here is the opportunity for the prosperous men of all these communities, whose 
wealth has been amassed through the industrial developments of the past thirty 
years, to aid in the foundation and support of such an annex to the common schools. 
Almost every considerable city in the leading States of the Union now has a founda- 
tion of this sort, which offers to the ambitious youth of either sex the opportunity 
to prepare for what is before them. Only by this broad development of public 
industrial training shall we be able to lift our operative and mechanical classes 
out of the rut of that narrow policy, inaugurated by the labor union, which seeks 
to close up the avenues to the apprenticeship of trades, and amounts, practically, to 
shutting the American youth outside the opportunity to carn his bread by the train- 
ing of the brain as well as by the sweat of the brow. It will be wise if the intelli- 
gent farmers of the State close round the agricultural and mechanical department 
of the State University, and insist that every inducement and opportunity shall 
be given in connection with it for the training of the skilled captains of the soil, 
the commanders of manufacturing and engineering industries, and especially, that 
            
        
 
-P-A-G-E-487
  : * WEST VIRGINIA. 1703 
the cultivated young women of the State shall avail themselves of the extraordinary 
opportunities now offered there for instruction in gardening, fruit culture, and all 
that makes the country home the paradise of which we read in the poets, but which 
in reality it so rarely is. 
For a generation or more, West Virginia will hold the educational and industrial 
leadership of this great mountain land at the center of this old Republic. Here is 
to be witnessed, in the near future, a repetition of the rapid growth on the far West- 
ern border, with no danger of the fearful reaction and collapse which now threatens 
vast regions of that inhospitable country. An intelligent comprehension of the sit- 
uation and a resolute effort at making herself, not only the foremost in the school- 
ing, but a pioneer in the trained industrial educational movement of the time, will 
not only build up the Commonwealth at home, but render, perhaps, the best service 
now possible to the Republic. For, surely, nothing can more certainly make for the 
future welfare of the new Republic than this strengthening of the old East and 
the original Northwest, from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, by building up at their 
center this magnificent mountain realm, in which is now garnered up the future pros- 
perity of half a dozen States. Here, with the judicious support of the wealth of 
the great Commonwealths; the concentration of their educational, religious, social, 
and skilled industrial forces, may be wrought out among these mountains and val- 
leys a civilization that will attract anew tide of immigration from every section of 
the Union, and mightily strengthen those great conservative agencies on which we 
now rely for the salvation of the nation. Surely, the call of Providence was never 
more distinctly heard than to-day, to the people of this most interesting of the new 
States of the Union—that the splendid inauguration of the Commonwealth, a genera- * 
tion ago, shall become a prophecy of a larger and nobler life through centuries to 
come.

CHAPTER IX. 
REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA, 
  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU OF EpucaTIoN, ALASKA DIVISION, 
Washington, D. C., June 80, 1893. 
Srr: I have the honor to submit the following annual report of the general agent 
of education for Alaska for the year ending June 30, 1893: 
In the summer of 1890, in accordance with your instructions, I visited northern 
Alaska and established schools for the Arctic Eskimo at Cape Prince of Wales, Point 
Hope, and Point Barrow. Through the courtesy of the Secretary of the Treasury and. 
of Capt. L.G. Shepard, chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Depart- 
mént, I was permitted to accompany the U. S. revenue marine steamer Bear, Capt. 
M. A. Healy, commanding, on her annual cruise in Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. 
In addition to conveying me to the points designated, Captain Healy was under 
instructions from the Secretary of the Treasury to visit the coast of Siberia and 
distribute presents to the Koraks around Cape Navarin in return for shelter and food 
furnished shipwrecked American whalers. He was also under commission from 
Superintendent Porter, of the Census Office, to take a census of the native popu- 
lation along the Arctic coast of Alaska and the islands of Bering Sea, which popula- 
tion could not be reached by the usual enumerators. 
The trip to Siberia enabled me to make a cruise of 700 miles along that little- 
known coast, and study somewhat the character of the native population under 
conditions corresponding with those under which life must be maintained in Alaska. 
I found them to be a hardy, active, and well-fed people, owning tens of thousands 
of head of domestic reindeer. 
The taking of the census of Arctic Alaska furnished me even more extensive facil- 
ities for studying the condition of the Eskimo of Alaska. I found them, like their 
neighbors on the Siberian side, to be a hardy and active people, but because they 
had never been instructed to depend upon the raising of reindeer as a support, 
unlike the Siberians, they were on the verge of starv ation. The whale and walrus 
that formerly had constituted the principal ‘portion of their food have been destroyed 
or driven off by the whalers, and the wild reindeer that once abounded in their 
country have been killed off by the introduction of breech-loading firearms. 
The thorough canvass of the native population for enumeration, necessitating a 
Janding wherever even one or two tents were seen on the beach, furnished unusual 
opportunities for observing the educational needs of that people and learning the 
great difficulties under which schools will have to be carried on. 
Upon my return to Washington I had the honor on November 12 to address you a 
preliminary report of the season’s work, emphasizing the destitute condition of the 
Alaskan Eskimo. 
On the 5th of December this report was transmitted by you to the Secretary of 
the Interior for his information and on the 15th transmitted to the Senate by Hon. 
George Chandler, Acting Secretary of the Interior. On the following day it was 
referred by the Senate to the Committee on Education and Labor. 
On the 19th of December, Hon. Louis E. McComas, of Maryland, introduced into 
the House of Representatives a joint resolution (H. R. No. 258) providing that the act 
of Congress approved March 2, 1887, ‘An act to establish agricultural experiment 
stations in connection with the colleges established in the several States under the 
provisions of an act approved July 2, 1862, and of the acts supplementary thereto” 
and an act approved August 30, 1890, entitled ‘“‘An act to apply a portion of the pro- 
ceeds of the public lands to the more complete endowment and support of the colleges 
for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts, established under the provisions 
of an act of Congress approved July 2, 1862,” should be extended by the Secretary of 
the Interior over r Alaska, with the expectation that the purchase, improvement, and 
management of domestic reindeer should be made a part of the industrial education 
of the proposed college.     
    
1705
-P-A-G-E-490
1706 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  The resolution was referred to the Committee on Education, and on the 9th of Jan. 
uary, 1891, reported back to the House of Representatives for passage. (See Appen- 
dix A.) . 
It was, however, so near the close of the short term of Congress that the resolu- 
tion was not reached. 
When it became apparent that it would not be reached in the usual way, the Hon. 
Henry M. Teller, on the 26th of February, moved an amendment to the bill (H. R. 
No. 13462) making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for 
the year ending June 30, 1892, appropriating $15,000 for the introduction of domestic 
reindeer into Alaska, which was carried, The appropriation failed to receive the 
concurrence of the conference commitice of the House of Representatives, 
Upon the failure of the Fifty-first Congress to take action, and deprecating the 
delay of twelve months before another attempt could be made, with your approval, 
I made an appeal in the Mail and Express of New York City, the Boston Transcript, 
the Philadelphia Ledger, the Chicago Inter Ocean, and the Washington Star, as well 
as in a number of the leading religious newspapers of the country, for contributions 
to this object. The response was prompt and generous; $2,146 were received. 
(Appendix B.) 
As the season had arrived for the usual visit of inspection and supervision of the 
schools in Alaska, you were kind enough to direct that in addition to my regular 
work for the schools I should continue in charge of the work of transplanting domes- 
ticated reindeer from Siberia to Alaska. As the natives of Siberia, who own the 
reindeer, know nothing of the use of money, an assortment of goods for the purpose 
of barter for the reindeer was procured from the funds so generously contributed by 
benevolent people in answer to the appeal through the newspapers. 
The Honorable Secretary of the Treasury issued instructions to Captain Healy to 
furnish me every possible facility for the purchase and transportation of reindeer from 
Siberia to Alaska. The Honorable Secretary of State secured from the Russian Goy- 
ernment instructions to their officers on the Siberian coast also to render what assist- 
ance they could, and on May 25, 1892, I again took passage on the revenue-cutter 
Bear, Captain Healy in command, for the coast of Siberia. 
The proposition to introduce domesticated reindeer into Alaska had excitedwide- 
spread and general interest. In the public discussions which arose with regard to 
the scheme a sentiment was found in some circles that it was impracticable; that 
on account of the superstitions of the natives they would be unwilling to sell their 
stock alive; further, that the nature of the reindeer was such that he would not 
bear ship transportation, and also that even if they could be purchased and safely 
transported the native dogs on the Alaskan coast would destroy or the natives kill 
them for food. This feeling, which was held by many intelligent white men 
(Appendix C), was asserted so strongly and positively that it was thought best the 
first season to make haste slowly, and instead of purchasing a large number of rein- 
deer to possibly die on shipboard, or perhaps to be destroyed by the Alaskan dogs 
(thus at the very outset prejudicing the scheme), it was deemed wiser and safer to 
buy only a few. 3 
Therefore, in the time available from other educational duties during the season 
of 1891, it seemed important that I should again earefully review the ground and 
secure all possible additional information with regard to the reindeer, and, while 
delaying the actual establishment of a herd until another season, that I should 
determine the correctness of the objections that the natives would not sell and the 
deer would not bear transportation by actually purchasing and transporting them. 
‘The work was so new and untried that many things could only be found out by 
actual experience. 
First. The wild deermen of Siberia are a very superstitious people, and need to be 
approached with great wisdom and tact. 
Upon one oceasion, when Captain Healy purchased a few reindeer for food, the 
following ceremonies were observed: When getting ready to lasso the deer the own- 
er’s family seated themselves in a circle on’ the ground, where probably some rites 
connected with their superstitions were observed. Upon attempting to approach 
the circle, I was motioned away. After a short time the men went out and lassoed 
a selected animal, which was led to oneside of the herd. The man that was leading 
him stationed himself directly in front of the animal and held him firmly by the two 
horns. Another with a butcher knife stood at the side of the deer. An old man, 
probably the owner, went off to the eastward, and placing his back to the setting 
sun seemed engaged in prayer, upon the conclusion of which he turned around and 
faced the deer. This was the signal for knifing the animal. With apparently no 
effort, the knife was pushed to the heart and withdrawn. The animal seemed to 
suffer no pain, and in a few seconds sank to his knees and rolled over on his side. 
While this was taking place the old man before mentioned stood erect and_motion- 
less, with his hand over his eyes. When the deer was dead he approached, and 
taking a handful of hair and blood from the wound, impressively threw it to the   
    
   
-P-A-G-E-491
    EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1707 e 
eastward. This was repeated asecond time. Uponthe killing of the second animal, 
the wife of the owner cast the hair and blood to the eastward. 
Since then I have often observed the man who was selling a deer pluck some hair 
from the deer and put it in his pocket or throw it to the winds for good luck. 
If a man should sell us deer, and the following winter an epidemic break out in 
his herd, or some calamity befall his family, the ‘Shamans would make him believe 
that his bad luck was all due to the sale of the deer. 
Second. The Siberian deermen are a nonprogressive people. They have lived for 
ages outside of the activities and progress of the world. As the fathers did, so 
continue to do their children. 
Now, they have never before been asked to sell their deer; it isa new thing to them, 
and they do not know what to make of it. They were suspicious of our designs. 
And in reference to this state of mind I have found that being on a Government 
vessel has been of great assistance. It impresses the natives with confidence that 
they will be treated honorably and justly. This moral effect was so great that we 
secured results that otherwise could not have been obtained so easily. 
Then, Captain Healy, commander of the Bear, is well known for thousands of 
miles on both sides of the coast, and the natives have confidence in him. Witha 
stranger in command I am confident that but little would have been accomplished in 
the summer of 1891. 
Purchasing reindeer in Siberia is very different from going to Texas and buying a 
herd of cattle. In Texas such a sale could be consummated in a few minutes or 
hours. But in Siberia it takes both time and patience. 
Upon the anchoring of the ship in the vicinity of a settlement the natives flock 
aboard, bringing skins and furs to exchange for flour, cotton cloth, powder, lead, ete. 
Once aboard they expect to be fed by the captain, and bucket after bucket of hard 
bread is distributed among them, They know perfectly well that we are after rein- 
deer, but nothing is said about it. They have to he feasted first. They are never 
in a hurry and therefore de not see why we should be. 
After a little small presents are judiciously given to the wife or child of a leading 
man, and when everyone is in good humor a few of the leaders are taken into the 
pilot house and the main subject is opened. After much discussion and talking all 
around the subject, one man is ready to sell twenty and another perhaps only two. 
After all is arranged the leading men send their servants off after the deer, which 
may be in the vicinity or four or five days’ journey away. Sometimes these delays 
consume & week or more ata place, 
Another difficulty arises from the fact that they can not understand what we want 
of the reindeer. They have no knowledge of such a motive as doing good to others 
without pay. 
As arule the men with the largest herds, who can best afford to sell, are inland 
and difficult to reach. 
Then business selfishness comesin. The introduction of the reindeer on the Ameri- 
can side may to some extent injuriously affect their trade in deer skins. From time 
immemorial they have been accustomed to take their skins to Alaska and exchange 
them for oil. ‘To establish herds in Alaska will, they fear, ruin this business. 
Another difficulty experienced was the impossibility "of secur ing a competent 
interpreter. 
A few of the natives of the Siberian coast have spent one or more seasons on a * 
whaler, and thus picked up a very little English. Andupon this class we have been. | 
dependent in the past. 
It is very desirable that a native young man should be secured and trained as an 
interpreter who could be employed Yegularly, year after year. 
However, notwithstanding all these 3 diffieulties and delays, Captain Healy with the’ 
Bear coasted from 1,200 to 1,500 miles, calling at the various villages and holding 
conferences with the leading reindeer owners on the Siberian coast. Arrangements 
were made for the purchase of animals the following season. Then, to answer the 
question whether reindeer could be purchased and transported alive, sixteen were 
purchased, kept on shipboard for some three weeks, passing through a gale so severe 
that the ship had to “lie to,” and finally landed in good condition at Amaknak 
Island, in the harbor of Unalaska, having had a sea voyage of over 1,000 miles. 
Thus the results of investigations for 1891 were 
First. The cultivation of the good will ot the Siberians. 
Second. The actual purchase of sixteen head of reindeer. 
Third. That reindeer can be transported with the same facility as other domestic 
cattle; they being safely loaded, kept on shipboard for three weeks, and landed in 
good condition 1,000 miles away. 
Upon my return to Washington in the fall of 1891 the question was again urged 
upon the attention of Congress, and on the 17th of December, 1891, the Hon, H. M. 
Teller introduced a bill (Ss. 1109) appropriating $15,000, to be expended under the 
direction of the Secretary of the Interior, for the purpose of introducing and main-

e 
taining in the Territory of Alaska reindeer for domestic purposes, This bill was 
referred to the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, Hon. Algernon 8. Paddock 
chairman. The committee took favorable action and the bill was passed by the Sen- 
ate on May 23, 1892. On the following day it was reported to the House of Repre- 
sentatives and referred to the Committee on Appropriations. A similar bill (H.R. 
7764) was introduced into the House of Representatives by Hon. A, C. Durborow 
and referred to the Committee on Agriculture. 
On April 15 Hon. §. B. Alexander, of North Carolina, reported the bill to the House 
of Representatives with the approval of the Committee of Agriculture. (Appendix 
D.) The bill was placed on the Calendar. é 
On the 2d day of May, 1892, I started for my third summer’s work on the coast of 
Siberia and Arctic Alaska in the U. 8. 8. Bear, Capt. M. A. Healy commanding. 
In accordance with your instructions, all the time that could be spared from the 
schools was given to the extablishment of the experimental reindeer station. 
Upon reaching Unalaska, May 22, I was much encouraged to learn that the rein- 
deer left last fail on Amaknak and Unalaska Islands had wintered successfully and 
were in good condition, with an increase of two. 
We reached Cape Navarin, Siberia, on the 6th of June, and proceeding north called 
at various points on the coast. Our progress was greatly hindered by heavy fields 
of ice. The good ship had two anchors ground up and one of the blades of the pro- 
peller broken off by the ice. Uponseveral occasions we were so surrounded that the 
propeller was stopped and the ship moored to the ice. A less staunch vessel would 
ave been unable to stand the strain. Howeyer, during the season five trips were 
made to Siberia and 175 reindeer purchased, brought over, and landed at the head 
of Point Clarence, which being the nearest good harbor to Asia on the American 
side, and a central point for the distribution of deer, I had selected, June 29, as the 
location of the first reindeer station. 
The first installment of deer, numbering 58, was landed at the new station at 6 
- o'clock on the morning of the 4th of July. 
Mr. Miner W. Bruce, of Nebraska, was appointed superintendent of the station 
and herd, with Mr. Bruce Gibson, of California, his assistant. (Appendix H.) 
Upon the establishment of the experimental reindeer herd at Port Clarence it 
became important to gain information concerning the surrounding country. 
To secure full and reliable information with reference to pasturage in the vicinity 
of Bering Straits I had the previous season employed Mr. W. T. Lopp, teacher ati 
Cape Prince of Wales, to make two trips northward along the coast in midwinter 
(1891-92), when the moss might be expected to be covered with ice and snow (see 
Appendix E), and in the fall of 1892 sent Mr. Bruce Gibson, assistant superintendent 
of the reindeer station, with a party of natives, to the northward of Port Clarence 
(see Appendix F), and a few weeks later Mr. Miner W. Bruce, superintendent of the 
station. (See Appendix G.) 
These several reconnaissances proved both the abundance of moss and its accessi- 
bility for winter pasturage to the new station. 
A comfortable house, 20 by 60 feet, was erected as a residence for the superintend- 
ent and his assistant, and also for the storing of the annual supply of provisions and 
barter goods, 
Close to the main house two comfortable dugouts were built for the use of the 
herders. Four Siberians, well acquainted with the management of reindeer, were 
brought over and placed in charge of the herd. With the Siberians were placed a 
few young men from the Alaskan Eskimo, who are expected to learn the manage- 
ment and care of the herd. The present expectation is to increase the number of 
Alaskan boys, who shall become apprentices to the herders, and when they have 
sufficiently learned the business and proved their capability to take care of reindeer, 
a small herd will be given each one as his start in life. As from year to year the 
number of such young men is increased and a number of the natives become herders, 
the herds will naturally become more and more distributed thronghout the country 
until eventually the whole northern region shall be covered with them, as the simi- 
lar regions of Siberia and Lapland are now covered. (Appendix J.) 
With the accomplishment of this result several important objects will be attained.    
       
PERMANENT FOOD SUPPLY. 
In the first place, the population, which is now upon the verge of starvation, will 
be furnished with a permanent, regular, and abundant supply of food. As has 
already been stated the native supply of food in that region has been destroyed by 
the industries of the white men. (Appendix K.) The whale and walrus that once 
teemed in their waters and furnished over half their food supply, have been killed 
or driven off by the persistent hunting of the whalers. The wild reindeer (caribou) 
and fur-bearing animals of the land, which also furnished them food and clothing, 
are largely being destroyed by the deadly breech-loading firearm. It will be impos-  
-P-A-G-E-493
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1709 
sible to restock their waters with whale and walrus in the same way that we restock 
rivers with a fresh supply of fish, But what we can not do in the way of giving 
them their former food, we can, through the introduction of the domestic reindeer, 
provide a new food supply. 
Upon our return southward from the Arctic Ocean in the fall of 1891, Captain 
Healy providentially called at the village on King Island, where we found the popu- 
lation starving. The appeal for food was so pressing that the captain detailed a lieu- 
tenant to make a thorough examination of the village, and invited me to accompany 
him. Ina few houses we found that the families in their great distress had killed 
their sled-dogs to keep themselves from starving. In the larger number of families 
they were making a broth of seaweed, their only food supply. In all human proba- 
bility, if the ship had not learned their condition, the following summer not a man, 
woman, or child would have been left alive to tell the story. A few years ago the 
same thing happened to three large villages on the Island of St. Lawrence, and 
when, the following season, the revenue cutter called at the village, the putrefying 
corpses of the population were found everywhere—on the bed platforms, on the 
floors, in the doorways, and along the paths, wherever death overtook them. 
At King Island, having ascertained the condition of things, a purse was made up 
from the officers and a few others on board the ship, and the captain steamed some 
_ 200 miles to the nearest trading post, and purchased all the provisions that could be 
obtained, which were taken back to the starving village. This supply sustained the 
population alive until seal and walrus came some months later around the village. 
The movement of the seal and walrus, since their numbers have become greatly 
diminished, is so uncertain that, while a village may have plenty to eat one season 
they will be on the verge of starvation another. 
Siberian deermen brought to Alaska with the first herd. 
[From a photo. by Dr. 8. J. Call. Published by permission of the Californian.] 
  In the winter of 1890-91 there was a sufficiency of food at Point Hope. In the 
winter of 1891-92 the same population had to leave their village and make their 
way, in some instances hundreds of miles, to other villages to keep from starving. 
In 1891 one of the teachers on the Kuskokwim River wrote me that the inhabitants 
of that valley had had but little opportunity during the summer of 1890 to provide 
a sufficient food supply of fish, that consequently starvation faced them all winter, 
and that it was with great difficulty that they survived until the fish returned the 
following season. A teacher on the Yukon River reported this past summer that 
some of the natives to the north of him had starved to death. This same scarcity of 
food exists across the entire northern portion of North America, so that now, under 
the auspices of the Church of England, subscriptions have been opened in London 
for a famine fund out of which to send relief to the starving Eskimo of Arctic British 
America. This condition of things will go on, increasing in severity from year 
to year, until the food supply of the seas and of the land is entirely gone, and 
then there is nothing left but the extermination of the native population. The 
general introduction of the domestic reindeer alone will change this entire condi- 
tion of things, and furnish as reliable supply of food to that people as the herds 
of cattle in Texas and Wyoming do to their owners, or the herds of sheep in New 
Mexico and Arizona. The reindeer is the animal which God’s providence seems to 
have provided for those northern regions, being food, clothing, house, furniture, imple- 
ments, and transportation to the people. Its milk and flesh furnish food, Its mar-
-P-A-G-E-494
1710 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
row, tongue, and hams are considered choice delicacies. Its blood, mixed with the 
contents of its stomach, forms a favorite native dish. Its intestines are cleaned, 
filled with tallow, and eaten as sausage. Its skin is made into clothes, bedding, 
tent covers, reindeer harness, ropes, cords, and fish lines. The hard skin of the fore 
legs makes an excellent covering for snowshoes. Its sinews are made into a strong 
and lasting thread. Its bones are soaked in seal oil and burned for fuel. Its horns 
are made into various kinds of household implements, into weapons for hunting, 
fishing, or war, and in the manufacture of sleds. Then the living animal is trained 
for riding and dragging of sleds. The general introduction of such an animal into 
that region will arrest the present starvation and restock that vast country with a 
permanent food supply. It will revive hope in the hearts of a sturdy race that is 
now rapidly passing away. Surely, the country that sends shiploads of grain to 
starving Russians, that has never turned a deaf ear to the call of distress in any 
section of the globe, will not begrudge a few thousand dollars for the purchase and 
intreduction of this Siberian reindeer, and the rescue of thousands of people from 
starvation. 
5 REPEOPLING THE COUNTRY. 
In the second place, the introduction of domestic reindeer into Alaska will not 
only thus arrest the present starvation, but will assist in increasing the population. 
With a more generous food supply this population will commence to increase in 
numbers. Occupying a region whose climatic conditions are so rigorous that but few 
white men will ever be willing to make their permanent home in it, it is important, 
if we would save it from being an unpeopled waste and howling wilderness, that 
we build up the people who through generations have become acclimated and who 
are as fervently attached to their bleak and storm-swept plains as the people of tem- 
perate and torrid zones to their lands of comfort and abundance. 
They are a race worth saving. I find that public opinion, gained perhaps by a 
more familiar knowledge of the Eskimo of Greenland and Labrador, conceives of 
the Alaska Eskimos as of the same small type. But this is not true. 
In the extreme north, at Point Barrow, and along the coast of Bering Sea they are 
of medium size. At Point Barrow the average height of the males is 5 feet 3 inches 
and average weight 153 pounds; of the women, 4 feet 11 inches and weight 135. 
On the Nushagak River the average weight of the men is from 150 to 167 pounds. 
From Capé Prince of Wales to Icey Cape and on the great inland rivers emptying 
into the Arctic Ocean, they are a large race, many of them being 6 feet and over in 
height. At Kotzebue Sound I have met a number of men and women 6 feet tall. 
Physically they are very strong, with great powers of endurance. When on a jour- 
ney, if food is scarce, they will travel 30 to 40 miles without breaking their fast. 
Lieutenant Cantwell, in his explorations of the Kowak River, makes record that 
upon one occasion when he wanted a heavy stone for an anchor a woman went out 
and alone loaded into her birch-bark canoe and brought him a stone that would 
weigh 800 pounds. It took two strong men to lift it out of the canoe. 
Another explorer speaks of a woman carrying off on her shoulder a box of lead 
weighing 280 pounds. This summer, in erecting the school buildings in the Arctic, 
there being no drays or horses in that country, all the timbers, lumber, hardware, 
etc., had to be carried from the beach to the site of the house on the shoulders of the 
people. They pride themselves on their ability to outjump or outrun any of our 
race who have competed with them. They can lift a heavier weight, throw a heavy 
weight farther, and endure more than we. They are a strong, vigorous race, fitted 
for peopling and subduing the frozen regions of their home. 
Azetic and subarctic Alaska cover an empire in extent equal to England, Scotland, 
France, and Germany. With the covering of those vast plains with herds of domes- 
ticated reindeer it will be possible to support in comparative comfort a population of 
100,000 people where now 20,000 people have a precarious support. To bring this 
about is worthy the fostering care of the General Government. 
  CIVILIZATION OF THE ESKIMOS. 
f domestic reindeer is the commencement of the eleva- 
tion of this race from bar’ m to civilization. A change from the condition of 
hunters to that of herders is along step upward. in the scale of civilization, teach- 
ing them to provide for the future by new methods. 
Probably no greater returns can be found in this country from the expenditure 
of the same amount of money than in lifting up this native race out of barbarism 
by the introduction of reindeer and education. Thirdly, the introduction. 
        ARCTIC TRANSPORTATION, 
Fourthly, the introduction of the domestic reindeer will solve the question of 
aretic transportation. (Appendix L.) The present transportation of that region is 
by dog sleds. One load of supplies for the trader or traveler requires a second load 
 
-P-A-G-E-495
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 17E 
of food for the two teams of dogs, and they make but short distances per day, This 
difficulty of transportation has been one great drawback to the development of the 
country. It has interfered with the plans of the fur trader; it has interfered with 
Government exploration. Only three years ago, when the United States Coast and 
Geodetic Survey sent two parties to determine the internatio: boundary between 
Alaska and British America, the small steamer that was conveying the supplies up 
the Yukon River was wrecked, and it was with the utmost difficulty that the sur- 
veying parties were kept from starvation, because of the difficulty of sending suffi- 
cient food 2,000 miles along that great valley by dog sleds. If reindeer had been 
introduced into the country there would have been no such difficulty in furnishing 
food. Bills have been before Congress for several years proposing to establish a 
military post in the Yukon Valley. If such a post is established it is not at all 
improbable that a combination of circumstances may arise some winter by which 
the forees that shall be stationed there will be reduced to starvation, unless reindeer 
transportation shall have become so systematized that food can readily be sent in 
from other regions. The same is true with reference to the Government officials 
whom it may be found necessary to station in that region. 
The same is true of the forty or more missionaries and their families that are now 
scattered through that vast region; also, of the teachers and their families whom the 
Government has sent into that country. 
‘These are now separated from all communication with the outside world, receiving 
their mail butonce a year. With reindeer transportation they could have a monthly 
mail. 
During the past three years the whalers have been extending their voyages east of 
Point Barrow to the mouth of the Mackenzie River, and wintering at Herschel Island. 
To the owners of this property it would be worth tens of thousands of dollars if 
they could hear from their vessels in the winter, before new supplies and additional 
vessels are sent out in thespring. But thiscan not now be done. Last winter letters 
were sent out from the field, overland, by Indian runners that ascended the Macken- 
zie, crossed over to the Porcupine, and descended the Porcupine and Yukon rivers 
down to St. Michael, on the coast. It was ten months before those letters reached 
their destination. It was a great satisfaction to the owners to hear of the welfare 
of their ships and crews, but the news was too late for business purposes. Millions 
of dollars’ worth of property and thousands of lives are involved in the whaling 
business. With the introduction of domestic reindeer into that region itewill be 
both feasible and perfectly practicable to establish a reindeer express during the 
winter from the Arctic coast down to the North Pacific coast of Alaska. 
The southern coast of Alaska on the Pacific Ocean never freezes, and is accessible 
all the year round to vessels from San Francisco or Puget Sound. 
A reindeer express across Alaska, from the Arctic to the Pacific Ocean, would have 
a corresponding commercial value to that section as the telegraph between New York 
and London to theirs. It would enable the owners of the whaling fleet to avail 
themselves of the latest commercial news and keep a more perfect control over their 
business, 
COMMERCIAL VALUE. 
In the sixth place, the introduction of domesticated reindeer will add a new 
industry to that country, which will go to swell the aggregate of national wealth. 
Lapland sends to market about 22,000 head of réindeer a year, the surplus of her 
herds, 
Through Norway and Sweden smoked reindeer meat and smoked reindeer tongues 
are everywhere found for sale in their markets, the hams being worth 10 cents a 
pound and the tongues 10 cents apiece. There are wealthy merchants in Steckholm 
whose specialty and entire trade isin these Lapland products. The reindeer skins 
are marketed all over Europe, being worth in their raw condition from $1.50. to $1.75 
apiece. The tanned skins (soft, with a beautiful yellow color) find a ready sale in 
Sweden, at from $2 to $2.75each. Reindeer skins are used for gloves, military riding 
trousers, and the binding of books. Reindeer hair is in great demand for the 
filling of life-saving apparatuses, buoys, ete., and from the reindeer horns is made 
the best existing glue. One great article, smoked reindeer tongues, and tanned skins 
are among the principal products of the great annual fair at Nizhnee Novgorod, 
Russia. In Lapland there are about 400,000 head of reindeer, sustaining in comfort 
some 26,000 people. There is no reason, considering the greater area of the country 
and the abundance of reindeer moss, why arctic and subarctic Alaska should not 
sustain a population of 100,000 people with 2,000,060 head of reindeer. In Lapland 
the reindeer return a tax of $1 a head to the Government, so that they yield an annual 
revenue to the Government of $400,000. 
With the destruction of the buffalo the material for cheap carriage and sleigh 
robes for common use is gone. Bear and wolf skins are too expensive; but with the 
introduction of the reindeer their skins would to a certain extent take the place of 
the extinct buffalo. 
   
-P-A-G-E-496
1712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. ? 
The commercial importance of introducing domesticated reindeer in Alaska was.so 
manifest that shrewd business men on the Pacific Coast at onceappreciated the great 
possibilities involved, and hastened, through their chambers of commerce and boards 
of trade, to take action, urging their several delegations in Congress to do what they 
could to secure an appropriation of money for these purposes. (Appendix N.) 
Under favorable circumstances a swift reindeer can traverse 150 miles in a day. 
A speed of 100 miles per day is easily made. As a beast of burden it can draw a 
load of 300 pounds. 
The progress of exploration, settlement, development, government, civilization, 
education, humanity, and religion are all largely dependent in that region on rein- 
deer transportation. = 
If there is any measure of public policy better established than another, or more 
frequently acted upon, it has been the earnest and unceasing efforts of Congress to 
encourage and aid in every way the improvement of stock, and the markets of the 
world have been searched for improved breeds. The same wise and liberal policy 
will make ample provision for the introduction of the reindeer, which, of all animals, 
is the most serviceable and indispensible to man in high northern latitudes. 
If sound public policy to sink artesian wells or create large water reservoirs 
for reclaiming large areas of valuable land otherwise worthless; if it is the part of 
national wisdom to introduce large, permanent, and wealth-producing industries 
where none previously existed, then it is the part of national wisdom to cover that 
vast empire with herds of domestic reindeer—the only industry that can live and 
thrive in that region—and take a barbarian people, on the verge of starvation, lift 
them up to a comfortable support and civilization, and turn them from consumers 
into producers of national wealth. 
Tt will be noticed that the sum asked from Congress is only $15,000. I hope that 
this will not be misunderstood and taken as a measure of the importance of the 
movement, for if the proposed results could not be obtained with any less sum an 
appropriation of hundreds of thousands of dollars would be both wise and econom- 
ical. 
Bui so small a sum is accepted on the ground of proceeding with extreme caution. 
It is the commencement of a great movement that will, if successful, extend its 
beneficial influences as long as the world stands. Therefore we move slowly and 
carefully at first, in order to secure that success. Commencing in a small way, the 
first outlay of money is not large. 
In 1891 the 16 reindeer purchased averaged $10.25 each. This last season the gen- 
eral average was brought down to $5 each. 
So far the purchase of the reindeer has been defrayed from the money contributed 
by benevolent individuals. 
REVENUE-MARINE SERVICE. 
These gratifying results, however, could not have been attained without the 
hearty and active cooperation of the Revenue-Marine Service. 
If this office had been required to charter a vessel for the transporting of the rein- 
deer nothing could have been done with the small sum at our disposal. 
But the Secretary of the Treasury directed that the revenue cutter Bear, in addi- 
tion to her regular duties of patrolling the Seal Islands and the coasts of Bering 
Sea and the Arctic Ocean, following the whaling fleet, and inspecting the refuge 
station at Point Barrow, should also give what time was possible to transporting 
the reindeer. 
To the captain, officers, and crew of the Bear is due much praise for the hard work 
done by them. 
Special thanks are due Capt. M. A. Healy for his earnestness and efficiency in doing 
his part of the work; also to Lieut. D. H. Jarvis, Surg. 8. J. Call, and Assistant 
Engineer Falkenstein, who were in charge of much of the shore work of loading 
and unloading the deer, 
APPENDIX A, 
  [House Report No. 3414, Fifty-first Congress, second session.] 
Mr. McComas, from the Committee on Education, submitted the following report 
(to accompany H. Res. 258): 
The Committee on Education reports favorably House joint resolution 258, with 
sundry amendments recommended by the committee. 
Congress has passed several acts encouraging the establishment of agricvltural 
schools and experiment stations in the different States and Territories.
-P-A-G-E-497
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1713 
These several acts require the assent of the legislatures of the several States and 
Territories before their provisions become available; but as Alaska has no legislature, 
it is the only Territory which is unable to avail itself of the benefits and provisions 
of these acts. - 
This bill proposes to extend to Alaska the benefits and provisions of the agricul- 
tural acts through the Secretary of the Interior, in like manner to the other Terri- 
tories. The acts are recited in the preamble to the joint resolution. 
There has been very wide divergence of views with regard to the agricultural and 
horticultural capabilities of Alaska, or whether it has any agricultural capabilities 
at all, 
This bill would secure the establishinent of an experimental station in southern 
Alaska, which has a temperate climate, and test the question of what can and what 
can not be raised to advantage. 
This would be of very great service, both to the natives, who, through the Goy- 
ernment schools, are coming into our civilization, and to the white settlers who may 
locate in that vast region, which embraces about 580,000 square miles. 
‘There are hundreds of thousands of square miles of area within the Arctic regions 
of Alaska that, there is no question, can never be adapted to ordinary agricultural 
pursuits, nor utilized for purposes of raising cattle, horses, or sheep; but this large 
s especially adapted for the support of reindeer. 
This bill will enable the Secretary of, the Interior, through the Government indus- 
trial schools, to make the stock-raising of reindeer the great industrial feature of 
that region. 
This will utilize hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory, will build up 
a large and profitable industry, and, above all, will provide a comfortable support 
for the native population of that region. 
This is the more important at the present time because the American whalers have 
practically destroyed and driven out the whale and the walrus from the waters adja- 
cent to the coast of Alaska. 
The destruction of the whale and walrus has taken away three-fourths of the ordi- 
nary food supply of the Eskimo population, and that population to-day on the Arctic 
coast of Alaska is on the verge of starvation. The large canneries will soon take 
away the fish supply. 7 
The introduction of tame reindeer from Siberia into Alaska thus has a twofold 
importance: 
(1) As the establishment of a profitable industry. 
(2) As a relief of astarving people—a relief that will become more and more valua- 
ble as the years roll round; a relief that once established perpetuates itself. 
This project is wiser than to pauperize the people of Alaska. 
The revenue from that country warrants this. attempt to make these people self- 
sustaining. 
The lease of the Seal Islands by the United States Treasury Department to the 
North American Commercial Company, on the basis of 100,000 skins, ought to yield 
a revenue of about $1,000,000 annually. Under the old lease the revenue was 
$317,500 annually. 
'The extending to Alaska of the benefits of the agricuftural bill approved August 
30, 1890, would give for the year ending June— 
1890 .. - $15, 000 
1891 - 16,000 
1892 .. 
From the act establishing agricultural experiment stations approved July 2, 1862, 
-the sum of $15,000. 
The joint resolution would therefore carry for the year ending June 30, 1892, 
$93,000, and for the following year, $33,000. 
The committee report, therefore, this joint resolution, with the following amend- 
ments and recommend that it pass: 
In line 4, page 2, after the word ‘‘to,” insert “give any assent required by either 
of said acts, and to.” 
In line 45 page 2, after the word “ benefits,” insert ‘“‘and provisions.” 
In line 6, page 2, after ‘‘ Territory,” insert ‘‘of Alaska.” 
In line 7, page 2, after the word “acts,” add ‘‘in like manner as for any other 
Territory.”

Among the many superstitions of the Wandering Koraks and Chookchees one of 
the most noticeable is their reluctance to part with a living reindeer. You may pur- 
chase as many dead deer as you choose, up to 500, for about 70 cents apiece; but a 
living deer they will not give to you for love nor money. You may offer them what 
they ‘Consider a fortunein ‘tobacco, copper kettles, beads, and scarlet cloth for a single 
live reindeer, but they will persistently refuse to sell him. Yet, if you will allow 
them to kill ‘the v ery same animal you can have his carcass for one small string of 
common glass beads. It is useless to argue with them about this absurd superstition, 
You can get no reason for it or explanation of it, except that to sell alive reindeer 
would be ‘‘atkin” (bad). As it was very necessary in the construction of our pro- 
posed telegraph line to have trained reindeer of our own we offered every conceivable 
inducement to the Koraks to part with one single deer; but all our efforts were in 
vain. They could sell us 100 dead deer for 100 pounds of tobacco, but 500 pounds 
would not tempt them to part with a single animal as long as the breath of life was 
in his body. During the two years and a half which we spent in Siberia no one of 
our parties, so far as I know, ever succeeded in buying from the Koraks or Chook- 
chees a single living reindeer. 
    APPENDIX D.—DoMESTICATED REINDEER IN ALASKA. 
[House Report No. 1093, Fifty-second Congress, first session.] 
Mr. Alexander, from the Committee on Agriculture, submitted the following 
report: 
The Committee on Agriculture, to whom was referred the bill (H. R. 7764) to secure 
the introduction of domesticated reindeer into Alaska, report the same with a favor- 
able recommendation. This bill does not properly come within the jurisdiction of 
the Committée on Agriculture, but should have been considered by the Committee 
on Appropriations. At the suggestion of the chairman of the Committee on Appro- 
priations the Committee on Agriculture, having heard the testimony of the mission- 
aries from Alaska, the Commissioner of Education, and others in regard to the merits 
of the bill, have considered it and recommend its passage. 
The testimony showed that there are no reindeer in Alaska; that Alaska could sup- 
port many times enough reindeer to furnish the inhabitants with food and clothing,
-P-A-G-E-500
1716 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
and that the reindeer skins are indispensable for clothing; that the whale and wal- 
rus, the principal supply of food, have been destroyed to such an extent as to cause 
much suffering for food; that dogs are used for transportation, and in many places 
the supply of food is becoming so scarce that the natives are compelled to eat their 
dogs, thus depriving them of the means of hauling their supplies; that for the 
development of the country the domesticated reindeer is absolutely indispensable; 
that the domesticated reindeer can make a speed of 19 miles an hour, and that a 
fair average rate of speed is 12 miles per hour; and this means of transportation is 
necessary to develop the gold fields of the interior, which can only be worked from 
two to two and one-half months a year; that the reindeer would be distributed at 
the Government schools, the native youths taught to herd and raise them, the in- 
crease to be given to worthy students and native teachers for servicesrendered; that 
this will induce the natives to become herders, be self-supporting, and not a charge 
upon the Government; that the natives have no vessels that can transport the live 
reindeer from Siberia to Alaska; that the vessels from San Francisco to Alaska leave 
the 1st of May to the 1st of June, none later than the last date mentioned, and that 
if anything be done this year, it is absolutely necessary to get the appropriation in 
time to send the goods for the purchase of the reindeer by the revenue cutter that 
leayes San Francisco the 1st of June. 
The description given by the missionaries and others of the country, the habits ot 
the natives, etc., was interesting. The distress caused by the continued failure of 
the food supply shows plainly that the natives will not be able to sustain themselves 
and will become a charge upon the Government. For these and other reasons the 
Committee on Agriculture urge the passage of this bill. 
AppENDIx E.—Mr. W. T. Lopp’s RECONNOISSANCE ALONG THE Coast NoRTH OF 
BERING STRAITS. 
CaprE PRINCE OF WALES, ALASKA, 
January 20, 1892. 
Drar Sir: According to your instructions, I have made two expeditions up the 
coast north of here, and submit you the following report: 
In November employed Eskimo, dogs, and sled and explored west shore of Louge 
Inlet or Lake, just north of Cape Prince of Wales, up to its head, where Grouse 
River empties into it. The mountains (see chart inclosed) were sloping and roiling, 
not sharp and rocky, and covered with moss. Portions of these hills were covered 
with 3 to 5 inches of snow, but all the exposed portions were free from any snow. 
This inlet is about 30 miles long and has two outlets to the sea. Along the banks 
of Grouse River are acres of bushes (3 to 6 feet), hundreds of ptarmigan, and nice 
sized fish in the river. 
On December 27 started with boy, dogs, and sled for Ke-gik-tok. Had fine weather— 
short days—visited about 300 people. Somesettlements had plenty of oil, seal meat, 
and fish, and others had little or none. All were very anxious to have deer intro- 
duced. Most of them seem to doubt that ownership would ever pass into their 
hands. They complain that they have to pay exorbitant prices to Cape Prince of 
Wales chiefs for deerskins. They reported moss very plentiful. At that time there 
was so little snow that it would be unnecessary to graze deer on the mountain side. 
I could see that the smooth expanse of country from coast to mountain was covered 
with only 3 or 4 inches of soft snow, no crusts or ice. (Unlike last winter, there 
haye been no thaws this winter, consequently no ice crust on snow.) These coast 
people live on seal meat, oil, fish, ptarmigan, and squirrel. They are not a tradin 
people, have had little or no intercourse with ships; are honest, industrious, ae 
healthy. 
Found a very prosperous settlement at Ke-gik-tok of 80 people. Asked me to 
bring the school up there, ete. 
I think several hundred deer could be grazed along the hills from Cape Prince of 
Wales to Ke-gik-tok. Iam satisfied from what I have seen and heard that there 
are hundreds of acres of good grazing land extending from the coast back to rivers 
flowing into lakes back of Port Clarence and those flowing into Kotzebue Sound. 
Settlements are so distributed along the coast from Cape Prince of Wales to Kotze- 
bue Sound that deer men along the mountains could easily be supplied with seal oil 
and meat. And if inclosures are ever necessary there are plenty of bushes in small 
rivers to make them. I think these coast people are better situated and adapted 
for herding than any other Alaskan people. 
They are all superstitious and are great cowards after dark. Perhaps it will be 
necessary to have them stand watch at night in pairs until they become accustomed 
   
-P-A-G-E-501
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1717 
to the darkness. (One Eskimo never goes any place after dark if he can help it. 
He sees ghosts; but is all right with a companion.) 
Hoping and trusting that we may sometime have occasion to make use of knowl- 
edge obtained on these two little expeditions, J am, 
Very truly yours, 
W. T. Lope.

APPENDIX F,—RECONNOISSANCE NortH OF PorT CLARENCE BY BRUCE GIBSON. 
  REINDEER STATION, PorT CLARENCE, ALASKA, 
August 2, 1892. 
Sir: I respectfully submit herewith report of expedition made by Mr. Gibson into 
interior, north of station, for the purpose of ascertaining probable condition of 
grazing for reindeer during winter months—copied from his notes as follows: 
“T started on expedition July 27, leaving station at 12 o’clock noon; taking with 
me as guide Charley, as expert on pasturage Chief Herder Pungen, and five natives 
to pack tent and supplies. Traveled in a northwesterly direction, and for about 4 
miles found good feed and several small lakes. I then changed my course to north 
for about three-quarters of a mile and found scarcely any feed, it being very rocky and 
barren; I then went west again for 7 miles and camped at a river about 30 feet wide. 
The first quarter of a mile of this last course was very rocky, bowlders from 4 to 6 
feet through being plentiful, the remainder of the distance being good feeding 
grounds. 
“The next day started north and traveled in that direction for about 9 miles and 
found good pasturage on east side most of the way, and wild flowers and berries 
grew in places; the west side of river is barren and very perpendicular in several 
places. I then traveled to west, and for ashoré distance on a small river found some 
feed, but after traveling for 1 mile I retraced my steps and went to northeast for 
about 3 miles, when men began to complain of being tired and I ordered a halt for 
the night on a small stream running toward the east. To northeast I saw good indi- 
cations of feed. 
“The next morning I got an early start, taking with me the guide and herder and 
leaving the others behind to try and find a place to camp that night, having to go 
without fire the previous night and this morning. I crossed the small river and 
traveled north. Yor the first 2 miles there was but a small quantity of feed, having 
passed over some very rocky ground. The next 3} miles there is good pasturage, 
being plenty of grass and considerable moss. I crossed two small streams in this 
course. Traveled east to get around some large hills; at about one-half mile came 
to a large mound of slaty rock—mound about 30 feet high and 150 feet across. For 1 
mile east found good pasture; crossed a small stream running southeast; changed to 
north and for 1 mile found good grazing ground; halted ata large cluster of rock for 
lunch and shelter from rain; found a white surface on one of the rocks, and I made 
the following inscription : 
“«¢B, Gibson, July 29, 1892, 12 m., from Reindeer station.’ Resumed march to north 
and for 2 miles found good pasturage; crossed a small stream running to south. 
About 1 mile southisa lake. Changed course to east for 3 miles; crossed one stream 
and found good feed in abundance. The land was of a rocky nature. Started to 
return to camp and traveled southwest for 7 miles to where I gave orders for camp 
to be located, but found they had gone farther east. I crossed over good feeding 
ground of a boggy nature, similar to that surrounding station. The herder said 
it was the best seen since starting on expedition; it was mostly lowland and some 
low rock hills. I found the camp 2 miles east of where I expected it to be. 
“The fourth day I started east and traveled for 4 miles over low hills, the surface 
being of a broken nature and containing abundance of feed; coming to high hills, 
changed course to southeast for 24 miles, finding fair pasturage and ground slightly 
rocky. Sent packers on to river to find suitable camping grounds for night. I trav- 
eled 5 miles to northeast, finding good pasturage of a boggy nature; crossed one 
smallstream. Changed to southeast 1 mile and south 1 mile, finding good pasturage 
on low hills; changed to southwest over low, hilly, and rocky land, in some places 
slightly boggy; the feed on this last course was abundant and of a good quality. 
“Fifth day.—It stormed hard last night and blew the tent down about 3 o’clock. 
I broke camp about 7 o’clock and started for the station, taking a southwest course. 
Aiter traveling for about 5 miles I crossed a small stream running very rapidly 
toward the northeast. The land was low hills and furnished abundance of feed. I 
traveled 2 miles farther in the same direction and crossed a large stream with 
swift current and running northeast; the feed and land the same as passed earlier, 
 
-P-A-G-E-502

  in the day. Continuing in same direction, but a little more to west for 4 miles, I 
traveled over low hills; good pasturage and plenty of moss. I crossed large hill to 
north of station ; found if barren and very high and rocky. Jt is about 1 mile from 
bottom of hill to open land, and from there on to station is good grazing land. I 
arrived at station at 4.15 in the afternoon. It had stormed hard from the time [ left 
until my return, raining and blowing hard. 
“Tn closing, I will say the herder “told me the ground passed over was very good 
and equaled and in places excelled the pasturage in Siberia. He further stated that 
the pasturage surrounding station was sufficient for a year, providing that in the 
winter there was not over : 1 foot of snow nor over 14 inches of icy crust on top. If 
the ice comes first and the snow later, it is impossible for the deer to dig out the 
feed. 
“T noticed in my travels that the feed was on low hills and lowlands, the high hills 
being barren. 
“The guide, Charley, said that for a long distance into the interior the lowlands 
were the same as passed over, thus showing that, should it be necessary to go to the 
interior this winter, there will surely be plenty of feed for the reindeer.”

APPENDIX G.—RECONNOISSANCE East or Port CLARENCE, BY MINER W. BRUCE. 
REINDEER STATION, PoRT CLARENCE, ALASKA, 
- August 19, 1892, 
Sir: In your letter of instructions for the government of this station, ete July 4, 
ultimo, you suggest, among other things, that two expeditions be sent out for the 
purpose of ascertaining the prospects for winter grazing for the reindeer should the 
country in this immediate vic ‘inity becomo covered with ice or deep snow, thus pre- 
venting the deer from pawing through it for food. 
One route designated by you was to the north for the station, in the direction of 
Kotzebue Sound; and in accordance with* your instructions Mr. Gibson, on the 27th 
ultimo, made a trip in that direction, lasting four days and a half, the result of which 
I communicated to you officially on tho 24 day of the present month, 
On the 3d instant I started on a trip to the northeast with an oomeak a 
natives, expecting, if my health permitted, to be gone ten days or two w 
Our route lay ‘through Grantley Harbor into Imnrock Lake, and havi cae a fair 
wind we made a splendid day’s sail, taking us about halfway through the lake, and 
camping the first night on the w est side. 
Iwish especially to call your attention to the route from Grantley Harbor into 
Immrock Lake, as it affords, in the event of severe storms, unusual shelter for the 
deer. 
A narrow passage, probably 6 miles in length, connects these two beautiful bodies 
of water, and as it winds its zigzag course along the live of bluffs on each side, 
which commence immediately on leaving Grantley Harbor, is unbroken until Imn- 
rock Lake is reached. The passage seems to be of nearly an uniform width, and 
will not exceed, at its widest part, one-quarter of a mile. The bluffs on both sides 
are about 200 feet high, and there appears to be water sufficient to float an ocean 
vessel. 
At several places along the route I left the oomeak, and with the Siberian herder 
went to the top of the bluff and found the country to the north a gently undulating 
table-land, and with my glasses I could see that for several miles this character of 
country dia not seem to change. 
- On the south side the same aspect of country appeared, but 4 or 5 miles to the 
south the country became more broken, and took in what appeared to be low moun- 
tains, 
The whole surface of the country on both sides was covered with a luxuriant 
growth of low bushes, occasional patches of grass, having the appearance of blue *   
a seven. 
        
  _joint, and what was certainly red-top grass and mosses. 
Even on this table-land the surface of the country was very uneven, being in places 
hummocky, and the little spots between seemed to be marshy and often filled with 
water. 
The Siberian herder seemed inuch pleased with the character of the feed, and fre- 
quently pointed out the different kinds of grasses cr shrubbery that the deer were 
fond of, and always designated the moss as choice winter grazing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-503
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1719 
  From the natives in my party I learned that the snow in this passage does not 
reach a depth of over 1 foot, and usually less; also, that when one side of ‘the passage 
is covered with snow, the other is lightly covered. If this be true, it would appear 
that the deer, if it becomes necessary to move them from the station, can find good 
grazing either one side or the other of the passage; and in severe storms a refuge 
may be had behind the high walls of the binfis. 
On the morning following our first day’s sail I took the herder to the top of the 
hill just back of our camp. It is probably 400 or 500 feet high and runs out toa 
point into: Imuruk Lake, From its top a splendid view of the country in every 
direction is had. The general contour, as far as I could see, was the same as that 
observed from the blufts along the narrow passage. My position commanded a view 
to the northwest, north, and northeast, and for a distance of 25 miles at least the 
same character of country prevailed. As far as the eye could reach not a mountain 
was visible and not a speck of snow was seen. 
To the west there were several miles of what appeared to be a marsh, or a very 
low land, covered with little patches of water back from the lake. These gradually 
disappeared in the north, where the land became higher and of the same general 
character I found farther to the south. 
From my position I could see the faint outline of the north end of the lake, prob- 
ably 12 or 15 miles away, and I thought I could discern the winding course of a river 
Onn through the table-lands to the north, and if so, it was probably the Agee-ee- 
uk River. 
£ On the sides and top of the hill from which I was making my observations there 
was a thick growth of the same kind of grasses and shrubbery found the day before. 
I was surprised to find along the route to the top of the hill patches of low willow 
and elder bushes, from the branches of which twittered and flitted small birds, and 
every few paces we advanced aroused ptarmigan in large numbers. 
There was nothing in the appearance of the country, so far as I could see, that 
would suggest anything like what one would expect to find bordering on the Arctic 
circle. On the contrary, the vegetation, much of it, was such as is found in temper- 
ate climates, and the birds and insects of the same variety that abound in country 
where the mercury never ranges lower than zero. 
From my position on the top of the hill I could see what appeared to be a break in 
the range of mountains on the south side of the lake, and as the wind was blowing 
from the north, thus preventing farther advance in the present state of the weather, 
I concluded to sail to the other side and investigate the country in that direction. 
The distance across was about 4 miles, but the wind died ont when about halfway 
across, and we were compelled to paddle the rest of the way, a very slow process of. 
travel in an oomeak. 
On reaching shore we went into camp, and after dinner I started with the natives 
for the mountains. My purpose was to simply get an idea of the country. between 
the shore of the lake and the foot of the mountains that day, and take all of the next 
for determining the extent of the pass. 
All the afternoon we traversed the lowlands toward the mountains and found the 
same general growth of vegetation as that found before. It could not well be of 
thicker growth or to all appearances more nutritious. If anything there was more 
moss, ani perhaps the low bushes hung fuller with blueberries than any found before. 
There were several small mountain streams leading across to the lake, and if they 
were supplied from melting snow it was far up or hidden between narrow gorges, as 
none were seen from where we traveled. 
It was after 6 o’clock when we returned to camp, and before retiring the natives 
understood that on the morrow we were going to try to find a passage into the 
interior. 
Accordingly by 7 o’clock we were ready to begin our tramp. We took with us an 
ax, spade, field glass, and two hard-tack apiece. Our course lay across the lowlands 
toward what appeared to be a break in the mountains, and it was at least 7 miles 
from camp across to the entrance. Part of the distance lay over comparatively 
smooth land, and a considerable portion over hummocky ground. There did not 
appear to be any difference in the thickness of the vegetation or the variety in these 
two different surfaces, but the rough ground was the most tedious I have ever 
attempted to travel over. The little ridges or hummocks are too wide to step over 
and too shaky to stand upon, so that our trip over this section was a series of ups 
and downs, mostly the latter. 
At our stops for rest I had holes dug with the spade and was surprised to find a 
black, sandy soil, from 1 foot to 3 feet deep, in nearly every instance. Sometimes we 
could not dig more than a few inches on account of encountering stone or slabs of 
rock, but this was not the rule. I thought I discovered the secret of such a heavy 
and luxuriant vegetation here from the rich class of the soil and the abundance of 
water. 
    
-P-A-G-E-504
1720 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  In our way toward the break we passed through two groves of elder and willow 
trees that were dense, of from 2 to 4 inches in diameter near the butt and from 10 to 
15 feet high. It was evident that a little grubbing and thinning out would have 
improved the size of these trees materially. 
Our journey up the side of the mountain near what appeared to be a pass was a 
tedious one, for the nature of the ground was more or less hummocky. I find 
that this class of land is as liable to occur on high or table land as upon low and 
marshy ground. 
It became apparent as we ascended the mountain that the break or pass which 
appeared to extend through the range was a false one, and when near the top it ap- 
peared to be a sort of blow-out, which came to an abrupt perpendicular at the end 
of a sudden break ahead. From the top of the mountain we had ascended, although 
not the highest by considerable, we could see that the country to the south was a 
succession of mountains of perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 feet high, and that there was no 
pass into the interior unless following the course of some river. 
Accordingly, we commenced our descent about 2 o’clock, and varied our course 
somewhat. It took us farther to the east along the base of the mountains and then 
straight to camp. 
On our way back we passed over a section of country that was a complete bed of 
moss. We could rake it up in armfulls, and in a few minutes, during a spell of rest, 
we gathered sufficient to feed, as our Siberian herder declared, our whole herd of 
about 150 head of deer for one day. 
If his estimate was correct, I feel assured that in this particular section a half- 
dozen men with hand rakes and pitchforks could, in one week, gather enough to feed 
our herd the coming winter. 
At different times during the day, as had occurred during the day before, the 
Siberian herder gave me to ‘understand that a trip in search of winter grazing was a 
useless expenditure of time; that what might appear to be good feeding ground 
now when winter set in might be covered with a thick crust of ice or deep snow; 
that nothing could be told from the lay of the land whether feed could be gotten at 
by the deer or not; that a locality which was all that could be desired this winter 
would be totally inaccessible next; that it was the practice on the Siberian side to 
select what appeared to be a good ‘section for winter grazing, and if it became coy- 
Bee pet thick ice or deep snow, to move the deer to some locality where feed could 
e hat 
This was the same information Mr. Gibson had gathered from our chief Siberian 
herder, whom he had with him, and I partly resolved, if the wind was not favorable 
formoying north the following morning, to retrace my steps and return to the station. 
I had left rather against my judgment, for my work of late had told on me and I 
needed rest. Onmy return to camp that evening I was completely worn out, and 
during the night experienced a slight chill. 
The morning broke rainy, and I was feeling miserably. The judgment of the Sibe-* 
rian that it was a useless trip was a strong argument in my present condition, and 
when, an hour later, a strong north wind settled the matter of progress toward the 
north against us, at least for that day, but was a fair wind for the station, I ordered 
everything packed, and, after about fourteen hours’ sail, reached the station. 
As we must in a considerable measure depend upon the judgment of the four Sibe- 
rian herders, who have spent all their lives in the rearing and care of reindeer, it 
seems to me that in the present state of affairs at the station, with so mach todo and 
so little time before cold weather will set in, when the presence of myself and Mr. 
Gibson is required, further exploration in search of winter feed ought to be aban- 
doned, or at least postponed until later in the fall. 
From this view of the matter, I would respectfully ask a modification of your 
instructions upon this point. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, a

Sir: During the months of August and September, 1891, I purchased in Siberia 
and landed (September 21) at Unalaska 16 domestic reindeer. Having no herder to 
take charge of them, I turned them loose on the small island of Amatignak, where 
they successfully wintered.  
-P-A-G-E-505
  EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. | 1721 
  The landing this morning at this station from the U. 8. Revenue Marine steamer 
Bear (Capt. Michael A. Healy, commander) of a band of 53 domesticated reindeer 
from South Head, Siberia, together with four herders, marks the establishment of 
the first herd of the kind in Alaska. 
This is an event of far more than ordinary importance. If successful, it will create 
throughout northern and central Alaska a new food supply in place of the whale, 
the walrus, and the fur-bearing animals that are yearly becoming scarcer and more 
difficult to obtain. 
Furnished a better and surer food supply, the native population, now decreasing 
in numbers, may reasonably be expected to increase. 
Changing them from mere hunters to herdsmen, it will be the first upward step in 
their civilization. 
With the increase in civilization of the natives and the general introduction of 
domestic reindeer, the vast, bleak, frigid, and now comparatively useless plains 
of Arctic Alaska will be reclaimed and become a source of wealth and prosperity to 
the land. 
The realization of this desirable condition of things is largely in your hands. 
The friends of the movement and the National Government, which has been asked to 
extend it, will be encouraged to go forward or led to withdraw from further effort 
as the herd now intrusted to your care prospers or comes to naught. 
With so much at stake, you will make the care and welfare of the herd your first 
and most constant care. Everything else is of secondary importance. 
Winter grazing.—The most trying season will be next winter, when the food that 
now abounds everywhere will be largely covered up with snow andice. In Siberia 
Iam informed that the winter grazing is sometimes from 100 to 150 miles away from 
the summer grounds, the herd being driven back and forth spring and fall. 
It is essential, then, that you take early steps to find a good location for winter. 
To this end I would advise that as soon as your house is inclosed you take Charley 
and the most experienced of the Siberian herders and make a thorough exploration 
of the surrounding country. I would make one trip through Grantly Harbor, Yoks- 
hook River, Imtruk Lake, to the head waters of Agee-ee-puk and Cov-vee-arak rivers ; 
also, on the trail from Grantly Harbor toward Unala Kleet and St. Michael. I 
would also advise a trip into and through the mountains north of the station. 
Charley will bea good guide, and perhaps tho Siberian will know by the lay and 
general appearance of the land the most suitable place to winter. 
I feel great solicitude with regard to this. A mistake may result in the loss of our 
herd by starvation. The natives around Port Clarence affirm that, while there is not 
much snow on the plains between the hills and the sea, yet it is covered with a hard, 
icy crust which-the deer can not break through for food. They further say that, 
years ago, when the wild reindeer frequented the coast, they were only found in 
summer—that in winter they migrated toward Norton Sound. 
It may prove that the winter grazing grounds that shall be selected may he too 
far away; that it will become necessary to close up for the winter the present house 
and establish temporary headquarters in the vicinity of the deer. If this necessity 
arises, I would suggest that you build a log house (if in a timber country) or a dug- 
out for winter use. 
Protection from dogs.—Another danger to the herd arises from the attacks of strange 
dogs. You will therefore require one of the herders on watch to be armed, and 
instruct him to shoot down any dog attacking the herd and report the same to you 
for settlement. When a dog is thus killed you will send for the owner, explain to 
him the necessity for the step, express your regret at his loss, and then make suitable 
payment for the dog. 
When any visiting natives come into your neighborhood have them notified at 
once that they must keep their dogs tied up. Deal firmly, justly, kindly, and 
patiently with the natives, and thus secure their good will. 
Once a month you will count the herd, and if any are missing or have been killed 
note it down, with cause (if known), and report same with all the circumstances to 
the Bureau of Education. 
If any exigency arises by which it becomes necessary to kill a deer for food, you 
will first use any surplus among the geldings, and after that from among the bulls. 
None are to be killed, however, except in cases of extreme necessity. 
Herders.—The herders consist of two classes: 
1. Experienced men from Siberia. 
2. Native Alaskans who may wish to learn the management and care of reindeer. 
The Siberians, being away from their friends and among a strange, selfish, and at 
times jealous and suspicious people, need your special care and protection, Take 
pains to make them feel that you have a fatherly interest in them. I hope their 
treatment will be such that they will choose to remain with us permanently. 
The second class should be picked young men (one or two from asettlement), who are 
expected to take a two-years training in the care of the herd, and thus become fitted    
     
-P-A-G-E-506
  1722 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
to take charge of future herds in the neighborhood of theirown homes. At theclose 
of their two-years course, if they have been faithful to their duties and mastered 
the business, it is proposed to give’them the deer as their start in life. This class 
will need constant watching. Anyone persistently refusing to obey necessary rules, 
shirking his duties on watch, or otherwise showing a want of interest in this work, 
or anyone that proves too dull to learn, is to be dismissed from the service and sent 
away from the station. 
The second class are to be subdivided into classes corresponding with the number 
in the first class. 
For instance, if you should have twelve in the second class, and, as now, four in 
the first class, you will place three of the second class under the tuition and over- 
sight of each of the four of the first class; and whenever he goes on watch they 
shallaccompany him and be subject to his direction. It will then, as a general rule, 
be necessary for only one of the Siberians to be with the herd at atime. In case of 
sickness of one of the Siberians his pupils will be assigned duty with the others 
until the sick one recovers and returns to duty. 
After conference with the Siberians you will be able to systematize the hours of 
watch. In this I would defer largely to the method pursued in Sibe: 
When the seasons of watch are determined upon you will see tha 
promptly relieves the preceding one at the proper time. 
The herders of both classes are to be housed, clothed, fed, and cared for at the 
expense of the station. 
Shelter.—At the home station, when off duty, have the herders construct comforta 
ble dugouts for their own use. If you can spare the large dugout already cum~- 
menced, that can be turned over to the herders. 
If it becomes necessary to have the herd a great distance off, buy some walrus 
hides for a covering, and let the herders make a small tent that can be moved from 
place to place, 
You will make an inspection of the dugouts every Saturday, and require them to 
be kept as cleanly as possible. Allow no slops or offal to be thrown upon the ground 
near the door, 
Supplies.—You will furnish them with the necessary iron teakettles and pots for 
cooking. They are expected to procure driftwood for fuel. You will also furnish 
them a sufficiency of reindeer skins for bedding. These supplies are Government 
property, and are to be carried upon the inventory list. 
Clothing.—You will supply them with comfortable native fur clothing, according 
to the season. 
If the supplies I leave with you for this year are not sufficient, you will employ 
some of the native women to make more. As the reindeer clothing can be purchased 
ready made in Siberia cheaper than made in Alaska, you will make out at each sea- 
son a list of garments needed and respectfully request the commanding officer of the 
revenue cutter to have them purchased for you. For this you will furnish him suffi- 
cient barter from the reindeer trade goods. 
Once a month you willinventory all bedding, clothing, cooking utensils, and otber 
Government property used by the herders, 
Twice a month, if the weather is suitable, all bedding should be hung out to air 
and sun upon a line erected for the purpose. 
Herders of the second class need special watching that they do not give or sell 
their clothes, bedding, or other Govérnment property to their friends. 
Food.—F lour, corn meal, pilot bread, beans, and tea will be sent from San Fran- 
cisco. It is best, however, as far as possible, to preserve their native diet. You will 
therefore purchase supplies of oil, dried and fresh fish, ete. 
As soon as you can determine it fix upon a regular ration, which you can issue 
daily or at regular intervals as experience shall show to be best. 
Outsiders or friends are not to be allowed to gather in and eat with the herders. 
Nor shall the herders be allowed to give them food. If any food is to be given away it 
must be done by the superintendent or his assistant, and an account kept of the same, 
giving date, approximate amount, and number of recipients. You will encourage 
the herders when off duty to trap for rabbits and foxes both for fur and food. 
When any garment, bedding, skin, or other property (except food) is issued to a 
herder or his wife, charge it against him in a book kept for the purpose. This will 
be a check against wastefulness, prevent anyone receiving more or less than his 
share, and enable us to keep an account of the expense of training each individual. 
Wives.—If any of the herders shall be married and have their wives with them, you. 
can issue a ration and clothing also to the wife, requiring from her in return some 
sewing or cooking for the herders. If there are several women you can apportion 
the work among them. 
School.—If circumstances will permit, you will gather the herders that are off duty, 
and such others as may wish to attend, into the schoolroom for two or three hours 
daily (except Saturday and Sunday) and drill them in elementary reading, arith-    } each Watch

metic, and writi Special emphasis will be given, both in and out of school, to 
the uso of the English language. 
Fuel.—As far as possible you will procure and use driftwood for fuel at the station. 
The coal is to be reserved for keeping a fire through the night and for seasons when 
you may be unable to secure driftwood. 
Morais.—It is scarcely necessary to write that you will allow no liquor, gambling, 
profanity, or immorality at the station or among the herders. 
You will allow no barter or unnecessary work at the station on Sunday. 
You or your assistant must always be at the station. Both of you must not be 
absent at the same time. If thestation is temporarily removed to the winter graz- 
ing grounds then that for the time being becomes headquarters. 
Reports.—1. You will keep a log book or brief daily journal of events at the station, 
extending from July 1 of each year to the following June 30. This book is to be 
mailed to the Bureau of Education. 
2. You will keep in a book furnished you an itemized statement of all the barter 
for supplies for the station, giving date of transaction, name and quantity of article 
purchased, and articles and quantities of each given in exchange, A copy of this 
statement will be annually forwarded to the United States Bureau of Education. 
8. On the last day of March, June, September, and December of each year you 
will make out an inventory of all stores and public property in your possession, 
including bedding and cooking utensils in use by the herders. This does not include 
the clothing issued to and in use by the herders. 
A copy of these reports will be forwarded by the annual mail to the United States 
Bureau of Education. 
4, On the last day of June each year you will make out and mail to the United 
States Bureau of Education an annual report of operations at the station. In this 
report you will embody any recommendations that your experience may suggest for 
the benefit of the station. 
5. On the Ist of August cach year you will make a requisition for supplies for the 
following year. 
As the work is new and untried, much must necessarily be left to your discretion 
and good judgment. 
Wishing you great success, I remain

APPENDIX J.—DOMESTIC REINDEER IN LAPLAND. 
  [From Du Chaillu’s Land of the Midnight Sun, vol. 2, pp. 167 and 168.] 
The Fjeld Lapp’s time is engaged in adding to his herd, to which he and his family 
devote all their energies, for their welfare depends on the growth of the animals. 
It is difficult to ascertain exactly the increase or decrease of reindeer according to 
the districts, for the people often change, and there has been of late years in the 
north a large’immigration of Norwegian Lapps to the territory of Sweden, especially 
to Kéresuando, but, taken as a whole, the population and the reindeer are increasing. 
There is a greater number in Norway than in Sweden, owing to the number of 
stationary binder (farmer) and sea Lapps, which far outnumber the nomads, 
According to the late census there are in Sweden (1870) 6,702 Laplanders, with 
220,800 reindeer; in Norway (1865), 17,178 Laplanders, with 101,768 reindeer; in Fin- 
land (1865), 615 Laplanders, with 40,200 reindeer; in Russia (1859), 2,207 Laplanders, 
with 4,200 reindeer. 
With those that belong to farmers and others I think we may safely say that the 
reindeer number about 400,000, The Samoides have the largest and finest breeds 
which are not numbered among those of the Lapps. In Kautokeino there are Lapps 
who own 2,000 reindeer; in Sorsele, in Sweden, one is said to own 5,000, and others 
1,000 and 2,000. Some of the forest Lapps have 1,000. In Lulea Lappmark there 
are herds of over 2,000; in Finmarken, of 5,000; and some Lapps have owned as 
many as 10,000. A herd of 2,000 to 2,500 is said to give about 200 to 250 calves 
yearly. - 
cs Every owner has his own mark branded upon the ears of all his reindeers, and no 
other person has a right to have the same, as this is the lawful proof of ownership; 
otherwise, when several herds are mingled on the mountains, the separation would be 
impossible. According to custom no one can make a new mark but must buy that 
of an extinct herd; if these are scarce the price paid to the families that own them 
is often high; the name of the purchaser and each mark have to be recorded in court, 
like those of any other owner and property. The tax paid is according to the pasture 
land oceupied. :

  U. 8S. REVENUE STEAMER Brar, 
San Francisco, Cal., December 6, 1890. 
Dear Sir: Under orders from the Secretary of the Treasury, J have been ten years 
on the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean station of the U. 8S. Revenue-Marine Service. 
My duties have brought me very closely in contact with and greatly interested me 
in the native population. 
On account of this interest, I have watched with pleasure the coming among them 
oF pe missionaries of the several churches and the teachers of the Government 
schools. 
I neve also seen with apprehension the gradual exhaustion of the native food 
supply. 
From time immemorial they have lived principally on the whale, seal, walrus, sal- 
mon, and wild reindeer. But in the persistent hunt of white men for the whale and 
walrus, the latter has largely disappeared, and the former been driven beyond the 
reach of the natives, ‘The white men are also erecting canneries on their best fish- 
ing stream, and the usual supply of fish is being cut off; and with the advent of improved firearms the wild reindeer are migrating farther and farther away. 
With the disappearance of the whale, walrus, salmon, and reindeer, a very large 
portion of their food supply is taken away, and starvation and gradual extinction 
appear in the near future. 
On my recent cruise I was accompanied by Dr. Sheldon Jackson, United States 
General Agent of Education, and together we have made the question of a future 
food supply the subject of special thought and investigation. 
We have consulted with a few of the leading teachers, missionaries, traders, and 
whaling captains whom we have met, and they, without a single exception, agree 
with us that the most practical relief is the introduction of domesticated reindeer 
into that portion of northern and arctic Alaska adapted to them. 
In Lapland there are 400,000 domesticated reindeer, sustaining a population of 
27,000. In Siberia, but a few miles from Alaska, with climate and country of similar 
conditions, are tens of thousands of tame reindeer supporting thousands of people, 
and it will be a very easy and comparatively cheap matter to introduce the tame 
reindeer of Siberia into Alaska, and teach the natives the care and management of 
them. 
This it is proposed to do in connection with the industrial schools established 
among the natives by the Bureau of Education. As in connection with the indus- 
trial schools in Dakota, Indian Territory, and elsewhere, the Indian boy is taught 
the raising of stock, so in the industrial schools of Alaska it is proposed to teach the 
Eskimo young men the raising of tame reindeer. 
A few thousand dollars expended now in the establishment of this new industry 
will save hundreds of thousands hereafter. For if the time comes when the Govern- 
ment will be compelled to feed these Eskimo it will cost over $1,000,000. 
In northern Alaska there are about 400,000 square miles that are adapted to the 
reindeer and are unfit for anything else. 
This region has a present population of about 20,000, all of whom will be ulti- 
mately benefited by the new industry. 
With an assured support, such as will come from herds of tame reindeer, there is 
no reason why the present population shall not be increased in numbers and advanced 
to the position of civilized, wealth-producing American citizens. 
Asking for your favorable consideration and earnest advocacy of this matter, 
I remain, very respectfully, 
‘ M. A. Heaty, 
Captain, U.S. Revenue Marine.

U.S. Commissioner of Education, Washington, D. C. 
DESTITUTION AMONG THE ALASKA ESKIMO. 
[An interview with Capt. M. A. Healy, U.S. Revenue-Marine Service, in San Francisco Chronicle December 12, 1890.] 
For several seasons past the Eskimo of northwestern Alaska have experienced 
great hardships in obtaining a supply of deer meat for their winter stores. It is to 
be feared that when the Bear makes her annual visit to the Arctic next summer many 
of the villages will be found to have lost their residents from starvation. The latest 
advices from the Arctic report a failure not only in the autumn deer hunt, butin the 
entire catch of whales, walrus, and seals.  
-P-A-G-E-509
EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1725 
  Naturally of a timid disposition the deer have learned that the natives with breech- 
loading arms are far more formidable foes than when bows, arrows, and spears were 
employed in the chase. Again, the Eskimo spare neither young nor old when a herd 
is found, and little suckling fawns, as well as does carrying young, fall victims to 
their guns. 
Formerly on the lower Yukon around St. Michael, on Norton Sound, and in the 
country known as the Kotzebue Sound district, numbers of deer made yearly visits. 
“Now it is rare to find that the natives living at these points have seen or tasted deer 
meat, 
The Alaskan deer of the arctic and subarctic regions have been. confounded with 
the reindeer of other localities, but while certainly belonging to the rangifer family, 
they are the true barren-ground caribou, differing from the upland caribou and 
domesticated reindeer of Lapland and Siberia in being smaller in body and horns. 
From July to September the instincts of the deer induce them to come from the inte- 
rior to the seacoast to obtain rest and freedom from the tortures inflicted by the 
hordes of mosquitoes that infest the inland swamps, and also to get saline matter 
from the herbage and moss growing in proximity to the ocean. In September they 
commence their inland migration, and from July until the middle of October they 
are ruthlessly pursued by the natives. Some rest is afforded to the animals during 
the dark days that prevail in the Arctic zone from November until January, but as 
soon after the early part of February as the weather permits the food seekers again 
take the field, The does have their young during April, and by a provision of nature 
the horns of the female only attain size during ane time she is suckling the fawn and 
until it reaches such an age that it can feed—about two months. 
When it is considered that a deer weighing on an average 125 pounds is consumed 
ata single sitting by five or six natives it may be readily perceived that the average 
returns of a successful hunting party must be large to feed a village. 
During the past season in the Arctic the attention of Captain Healy, of the United 
States revenue steamer Bear, has been directed in a very pointed manner to the 
- attainment of some method whereby the supply of deer for food and clothing pur- 
poses may be increased in northwestern Alaska, This year, taking advantage of 
the presence on the Bear of Dr. Sheldon Jackson, United States Commissioner of 
Education for Alaska, the captain, in conjunction with Commissioner Jackson, 
intends to present to the Secretary of the Interior data upon the subject. 
Within a radius of 100 miles inland from the shores of the ocean on the Siberian 
coast, from Cape Navarin to Plover Bay, there are a people known as deer men. 
They belong to the Chukchee tribe of Siberians, and are essentially a nomadic race, 
wandering from East Cape,on the northern coast, to Cape Navarin, southward. 
Aceompanied by their herds of tame reindeer, aggregating in many instances thou- 
sands, they roam in s h of food. ‘These reindeer, while resembling the Alaskan 
species in the main, differ in the texture of theirskins, the pelts being spotted brown 
and white, with a smooth surface. These deer men subsist mainly on the products 
of their herds, bartering the skins with the coast natives for tobacco, seal oil, walrus 
hides for their boot soles, and other minor commodities, such as powder, shot, lead, 
and flour. At Cape Navarin and East Cape, Siberia, they sometimes meet the whal- 
ing ships and sell them deer meat and skins for tobacco, etc. 
Captain Healy’s ideas are to propose to the Government that he be empowered to 
purchase a number of these deer of both sexes and transport them on the Bear to 
some point on the Alaskan coast where moss and feed are plentiful. These deer are to 
form the nucleus of a herd, and from the yearly increase they can be distributed over 
other portions of the Northwest Territory. As the Alaskan Eskimo are not skilled 
in herding the deer, Captain Healy intends, if permission be granted by the Govern- 
ment, to endeavor to enlist the services of some experienced ‘Siberian natives to 
instruct them. 
Unless some measures be adopted, as suggested by Captain Healy, it is sure that a 
decade will witness the extermination of the people of our arctic province on its 
northwestshores. The results of the active and unscrupulous chase of their pelagic 
food supplies by the whalemen have already become evident; walrus are almost 
invisible on the ice floes within reach of the native hunters, while the flurried and 
galled whale makes its passage to the unknown regions of the Arctic Ocean at aspeed 
which defies the natives to capture it. 
The proposition of Captain Healy will be communicated to the Washington 
authorities at an early date. 
    
      
     
DESTRUCTION OF THE WHALES. 
[From Bancroft’s History of Alaska, pp. 668 and 669.] 
Of whaling enterprise in the neighborhood of the Alaskan coast mention has 
already been made; but a few statements that will serve to explain the enormous 
decrease that has occurred in the catch within the last three decades may not be 
out of place,   
 
-P-A-G-E-510
| 1726 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
Of the 600 or 700 American whalers that were fitted cut for the season of 1857, 
at least one-half, including most of the larger vessels, were engaged in the North 
Pacific. The presence of so vast a flect tended of course to exhaust the w: haling 
grounds or to drive the fish into other waters, for there are no permanent whaling 
grounds on any portions of the globe except those encircled by ice for about ten 
months in the year. In the seas of Greenland, not many years ago, whales were 
rarely to be seen; in 1870 they were fairly plentiful. The Sea of Okhotsk and the 
waters in the neighborhood of the Aleutian Islands were a few decades ago favorite 
hunting grounds, but are now almost depleted, while in 1870 the coast of New Siberia 
was swarming with whales. Schools of sperm whale are occasionally seen between 
the Alaska Peninsula and Prince William Sound, and the humpback sometimes makes 
its appearance as far north as Baranof Island. Between Bristol Bay and Bering 
Strait a fair catch is sometimes taken, but most of the vessels forming what is termed 
the North Pacific whaling fleet now pass into the Arctic Ocean in quest of their prey. 
Probably not more than 8 or 10 of them are employed on the whaling grounds of the 
Alaskan coast. 
In 1881 the whaling fleet of the North Pacific mustered only 30 and in the follow- 
ing year 40 craft, of which 4 were steamers. Tho catch for 1881 was one of the most 
profitable that has occurred since the date of the transfer, being valued at $1,139,000, 
or an average of about $57,000 for each vessel, some o: them returning with cargoes 
worth $75,000, and few w: ith e2 argoes worth less than $30,000. In 1883 the eatch was 
inconsiderable, several of the whalers returning “clean” and few making a profit 
for their owners. 
The threatened destruction of these fisheries is a matter that seems to deserve 
some attention. In 1850, as will be remembered, it was estimated that 300 whaling 
vessels visited Alaskan waters and the Okhotsk and Bering seas. Two years later 
the value of tho catch of the North Pacific fleet was more than $14,000, 000. 
After 1852 it gradually decreased until in 1862 it was less than $800, 0003 for 1867 
the amount was about $3,200,000; in 1881 it had again fallen to $1,139,000, and for the 
season of 1883 there was a still further reduction. 
  San Francisco, December 18, 1890. 
Dear Sir: Referring to your desire to obtain information relative to the intro- 
duction of reindeer into the northwest portion of the Territory of Alaska, I would 
say that in my opinion the project is entirely feasible. My experience in Alaska 
permits me to state on authority that the next decade will witness the extinction of 
the American reindeer, or rather caribou. In 1881, when I first visited the district 
of Norton and Kotzebue sounds and the lower Yukon, deer were plentiful. This 
past winter (1889) not a single animal had been seen within a radius of 200 miles, 
Similar conditions are coexisting from Port Clarence to Point Barrow, and where in 
former years the hunters had to travel but 50 miles to reach the deer haunts, to-day 
they traverse twice that distance. These contingencies arise from three causes: 
1. The indiscriminate slaughter of young and ‘old animals. 
2. The use at the present “day of improved weapons of the chase in lieu of the 
primitive bows, arrows, and spears, 
3. The conditions of wind prevailing at the seasons when the deer go to and from 
the coast. It must distinctly be understood that upon a supply of these animals 
our Alaskan Eskimo depend for clothing as well as their stores of meat should their 
pelagic sources of provender fail. 
The proposition to introduce deer from the Siberian herds can be effected at a cost 
of but a few thousand dollars. 
The location for the first experimental station should be on Choris Peninsula or 
the vicinity of Kotzebue Sound. This location has climatic similarities with Siberia. 
The food (moss) supply is abundant and herding easy. 
As the results of this initial experiment become manifest, additional locations for 
herds can be established. Within two seasons the Chukchee herdsmen will be able 
to instruct the Es o in the style of herding. 
Ihave made inquiries upon thesubject, andnow giveyou theresult, Ten yearsago 
the Russian steamer Alexander went to the Kamchatka Peninsula, and officers of ihe 
Alaska Commercial Company bought seven male and seven female deer, transporting 
them to Bering Island (one of the islands leased by the company from Russia). Cap- 
tains Blair and Greenberg and Superintendent Lubegoil inform me that the herd 
now numbers 180, From this you can judge the rate of propagation. 
The revenue steamer Bear can be utilized for transportation, and I know no man 
more capable of conducting the experiment than Captain Healy. 
I hope that the sinall sum required will be voted by Congress, as unless something 
is done for these people their annihilation is only a question of a brief period.

WILD REINDEER IN ALASKA. 
[Charles H. Townsend in the report of the cruise of the U.S. Revenue Marine Steamer Corwin, 1885, Capt. M. A. Healy, commanding, pp. 87 and 88.] 
Reindeer are found more or less regularly throughout Alaska. ® They were found 
by Mr. McLenegan on the Noiitak, as well as by our party on the Kowak. Traders 
in the service of the Alaska Commercial Company told me of their common distribu- 
tion over the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Aleutian divisions of the country. They haye 
even been shot on Unimak Island, at the end of the peninsula; but reindeer are 
restiess animals, irregular in their migrations and habits. Sometimes they desert 
whole sections of the country for months together, and they appear to have with- 
drawn from many regions where firearms have been introduced. Notwithstanding 
the fact that large herds of reindeer are kept in a state of domestication by the 
Chukchees at East Cape and other well-known places on the Asiatic side of Bering 
Straits, with whom the natives of the Alaskan side communicate regularly, there 
appears to be no domestication of the species whatever in Alaska, nor indeed in any 
part of North America. 
In time, when the general use of firearms by the natives of upper Alaska shall have 
reduced the numbers of this wary animal, the introduction of the tame variety, 
which is a substantial support to the people just across the straits, among our own 
thriftless, aleohol-bewitched Eskimos, would bea philanthropic movement, contrib- 
uting more toward their amelioration than any system of schools or kindred charities. 
The native boats could never accomplish the importation, which would, however, 
present no difficulty to ordinary seagoing vessels. The taming of the American rein- 
deer is impracticable, for domestication with this animal at least is the result of 
subjection through many generations. Something tending to render a wild people 
pastoral or agricultural ought to be the first step toward their advancement. In 
our management of these people, ‘‘ purchased from the Russians,” we have an oppor- 
tunity to atone, ina measure, for a century of dishonorable treatment of the Indian. 
REINDEER. 
  [From Eneyclopedia Britannica, vol. 7, pp. 24 and 25.] 
The reindeer (Tarandus rangifer), the only domesticated species of deer, has a range 
somewhat similar to the elk, extending over the entire boreal region of both hemis- 
pheres, from Greenland and Spitzbergen inthe northto New Brunswick in the south. 
Thero are several well-marked varieties, differing greatly in size and in form of the 
antlers, the largest forms occurring farthest north, while by many writers the 
American reindeer, which has never been domesticated, is regarded as a distinct 
species. The antlers, which are long and branching, and considerably palmated, 
are present in both sexes, although in the female they are slender and less branched 
than the males. In the latter they appear at a much earlier age than in any other 
species of deer, and Darwin conjectures that in this circumstance a key to their ex- 
ceptional appearance in the female may be found. The reindeer has long been 
domesticated in Scandinavia, and is of indispensable importance to the Lapland 
race, to whom it serves at once as a substitute for the horse, cow, sheep, and goat, 
As a beast of burden it is capable of drawing a weight of 300 pounds, while its fleet- 
ness and endurance are still more remarkable. Harnessed to a sledge, it will travel 
without difficulty 100 miles a day over the frozen snow, its broad and deeply cleft 
hoofs being admirably adapted for traveling over such a surface. 
During summer the Lapland reindeer feeds chiefly on the young shoots of the 
willow and birch; andas at this season migration to the coast seems necessary to the 
well-being of the species, the Laplander, with his family and herds, sojourns for sev- 
eralmonths in the neighborhood of the sea, In winter its food consists chiefly of the 
reindeer moss and other lichens, which it makes use of its hoofs in seeking for beneath 
the snow. The wild reindeer grows to a much greater size than the tame breed, but

in Northern Europe the former are being gradually reduced through the natives 
entrapping and domesticating them. The tame breed found in Northern Asia is much 
larger than the Lapland form and is there used to ride on. There are two distinct 
varieties of the American reindeer, the barren-ground caribou and the woodland 
caribou. The former, which is larger and more widely distributed of the two, fre- 
quents in summer the shores of the Arctic Sea, retiring to the woods in autumn to 
feed on the tree and other lichens. The latter occupies a very limited tract of wood- 
jand country, and, unlike the barren-ground form, migrates southward in spring. 
The American reindeer travel in great herds, and, being both unsuspicious and curi- 
ous, they fall ready victims to the bow and arrow or the cunning snare of the Indian, 
to whom their carcasses form the chief source of food, clothing, tents, and tools. 
‘. APPENDIX L, 
Capt. M. A. Healy, in January, 1892, writing to Senator Charles N. Felton, says: 
“The three great problems of existence of both natives and whites in the Terri- 
tory of Alaska are food, clothing, and transportation. They are to be solved in a 
rigorous climate and rough and almost impenetrable country, and one in which noth- 
ing as yet is produced from the ground. The food supply must either be found in 
the flesh of the wild animals and birds of the country or brought from without. 
With the white population the food might be said to be brought wholly from with- 
out, The enormous expense this entails has kept this population down to the nar- 
rowest limit of employees of firms or companies capable of maintaining stations 
there and confined these stations to a few scattered well-known points along the 
immense stretch of seacoast or on some of the principal rivers, as the Yukon. 
“Tood supply.—The native population of thenorthwest part of the country depend 
for food upon whale, walrus, seal, fish, and what few wild animals, such as deer and 
caribou, they can kill. The whale and walrus have been so persistently pursued by 
white men that they have rapidly diminished and are now so scarce and shy that 
their capture by the natives is attended with great difficulty and uncertainty. This 
scarcity of their principal supply of food is greatly felt by the natives along the 
whole northwest coast and to such an extent that in the short space of winter whole 
villages have been wiped out. 
“Thave seen almost the entire population of St. Lawrence Island lying strewn 
about their huts dead from starvation. And this winter of 1891-92 the same fate 
may be that of Kings Island. Upon my visit there in September last, the seal and 
walrus catch having failed them, the natives were reduced to the direst extremities. 
Their larders were exhausted and their only means of subsistence their dogs and 
the kelp and carrion cast up by the tide. What supplies could be spared from the 
vessel and what bought at St. Michaels station were given the people with the hope 
that it would tide them over until more successful hunting. But this hope is not 
without misgiving that upon my return in the spring I shall find many of them whom 
I count as friends cold in death. The interior natives are dependent wholly upon 
earibou and deer and what fish come into their streams during the short summer. 
Caribou and deer are rapidly diminishing there, as they have in other countries, and 
the fishing streams are being taken up by white men, so that the lines of existence 
are on all sides being drawn tighter and tighter about these poor native Alaskans, 
“Reindeer-skin clothing.—Clothing of reindeer skin has been found the best and 
only kind to withstand the intense and continued cold of the country. These skins 
are now bartered at a high price from the natives of the Siberian coast, and are 
passed along the Siberian side from village to village, increasing in value the farther 
they go from the Bering Straits. The experience of white men and natives has been 
the same, and even in our summer visits to the country we on the vessel use rein- 
deer clothing to keep from suffering. 
“The methods of transportation now in use in Alaska are by dog trains and boats. 
By boat it is impossible to travel nine months in the year, and during the three 
months of summer when the streams are open they can be used only down stream. 
By dog trains transportation is limited, slow, and uncertain, and the greater part of 
the load is taken up with food for the animals. These dogs have been so closely bred. 
that they are now degenerated in size, strength and sagacity. I have for years been 
requested by natives to bring them a larger breed to improve their dogs, and the 
Hudson Bay Company has imported the English mastiff for use in trains where the 
native dog is too slight. 
“Among the whites the greatest difficulty experienced by miners, missionaries, 
explorers, and residents has been the want of a rapid and assured means of trans- 
portation. The history of every expedition that has penetrated into the country 
any distance from the coast has been one of suffering and oftentimes hunger from 
the difficulty of travel and packing. Horses, cattle, asses, and other beasts of

burden, excepting tame reindeer, are out of the question, because they can not live 
in the country, and it is impossible to provide food for them when snow covers the 
ground the larger part of the year. On account of this difficulty the country, 
except along the seacoast and a few of the navigable rivers, is as little known to-day 
as when it was first bought. And those great mineral deposits which Alaska is said 
to contain remain as yet undiscovered. 
“What the reindeer might do.—TYo my mind the only satisfactory solution of all 
three of these problems, important as they are, is the introduction of tame reindeer 
into the country. In proper numbers they will transform the native population 
from a fishing to a pastoral people, and prove to them a never-failing supply of food. 
The hides of the animals already furnish almost the only clothing used, but at a 
greatly exaggerated cost. And to the white explorers, miners, missionaries, and 
settlers the reindeer will prove a means of transportation and packing that will 
enable them to learn and develop the resources of a vast country. 
“The natives of Siberia have for centuries herded and reared the tame reindeer, 
and thus been safe against periodical periods of starvation when the whale and 
wairus fail them. They are a strong, swift, and hardy animal, tractable and easily 
broken to harness and packing, and especially adapted, or, in fact, made for the 
country and climate. In travel they are self-sustaining. The supply of moss upon 
which they feed covers the whole of uorthern Alaska, and instinct leads them to 
secure it in winter as well as summer by burrowing through the deepest snows. It 
is not necessary for us to speak of the value of such pack animals to the prospector. 
To the explorer they are equally valuable, and when supplies fail are equally valu- 
able as food. 
“Tf I may revert back to the days of the Western Union Telegraph expedition to 
that part of the country where reindeer could be procured for drafting as well as 
for food, the thousand and one obstacles that at first seemed insurmountable were, 
through the medium of these animals, easily overcome. 
“The natives of Alaska quite see the advantage of such an animal in their midst, 
have expressed to me their eager wishes for them, and along the Yukon, the most 
thickly settled part of the country, the white people are enthusiastic over their 
introduction, for in them they see a solution of many of the difficulties of existence 
there. 
“The Siberians will sell.—Some writers and others have claimed that the Siberian 
natives will not sell reindeer to white men, but Dr. Jackson and I have disproved 
this by buying during the past summer, at different points on the Siberian coast, six- 
teen of the animals, and securing promises to sell us as many as we could take care 
of the coming summer, should they be wanted. The sixteen we purchased, the first 
ones to be introduced into the Territory, we placed at Unalaska for propagation. 
“T believe this is the most important question that bears upon the Territory of 
Alaska to-day, and a small sum donated by Congress for the purpose will in the end 
develop the country, its character and resources, and prove a great benefit to the 
commerce and wealth of the United States in general and the Pacific Coast in 
particular. 
“T am not referring to the Alaska of the tourist—that narrow strip of island from 
the southernmost boundary to Sitka—but to that immense territory of 500,000 square 
miles of the north and west, of which the world has no knowledge and no conception, 
and to which the Alaska of the tourist bears as much relation as the State of Florida 
does to the whole United States.” 
  APPLICATION FOR A TEAM OF REINDEER. 
  Fortry-MILe Creek, August 13, 1892. 
Dear Srr: Captain Peterson informs me that you would bring some reindeer, 
bought by the Government, to distribute in Alaska. If you did get any, and send me 
a pair, or better, two cows and one bull, I will surely reward your trouble, Iam 
doing freighting here in the winter with dogs, and reindeer would be far ahead of 
them. You could leave them in somebody’s care in St. Michael for the winter and 
have them sent up here in the spring. I will pay for all the expenses. If you did 
not get any this year for the Government, and you have a chance to buy some for 
me, I wish you would do it, and I will pay for them, whatever it is.

Philadelphia, Pa., April 16, 1892. 
Dr. SHELpoN Jackson, 
Bureau of Education, Washington: 
I received your favor of the 14th and a pamphlet, which I have read with great 
interest. If reindeer can be imported in Alaska from Siberia and if there exists 
abundance of reindeer moss in Alaska, the facilities for realizing the plan are rather 
reat. 
. Besides the advantages mentioned in the pamphlet, there exists one to which I 
want to call your attention—the great commercial importance. 
To Sweden and Norway it is not only the Laplanders who live on reindeer; 
smoked reindeer meat and smoked tongues are sold ev: eryw here in the said countries 
and the hides are in great demand, tanned to a soft skin (used for gloves, military 
riding trousers, etc.). 
There are merchants in Stockholm the only trade of whoi is in Lapland products, 
and the skins, dried with the hairs on, are exported by the thousands to Germany 
and England. I sold myself, 1878, about 5,000 such skins to a firm in Leipzig, Ger- 
many. “The Norwegian Preserving Company use large quantities of reindeer meat 
for canning, and fresh itis considered a delicacy. “Rassia exports fresh reindeer 
meat, frozen, in carloads to Germany. 
The price of smoked hams is in Sweden about 10 to 9 cents a pound; of smoked 
tongues, 8 to 10 cents apiece (or a pair, I can not exactly remember which); of dried 
hides, with hair on, $1.25 to $1.75 apiece, and more if they are not worm-bitten. 
The Swedish reindeer have mostly a kind of insect which lays its eggs in their skins; 
this causes holes, which are seen in the skin when tanned and diminish their value. 
The hairs are in great demand for the filling of life-saving apparatus (buoys, ete.), 
while they possess buoyancy in a wondrous degree. The best existin g glue is made 
of reindeer horns. If I were sure of getting a 1 trado in these articles and had the 
money J would not consider it a moment, but go to Alaska at the first opportunity 
and make a fortune in ten years. 
The number of reindeer killed for the trade (besides what the Laplanders use for 
themselves) is yearly 12,000 to 15,000 in Norway, probably 6,000 to 7,000; besides, 
Sweden imports large quantities of meat and skins from Finland. 
In 1881 I visited the fair in Nizhnee-Novgorod, Russia, and became there acquainted 
with a merchant from Nuhangel, who had brought to the fair 5,000 pair smoked 
tongues and 6,000 tanned skins (the tanned skins have a value of $2 to $3 apiece). 
A Swedish dragoon regiment wear trousers exclusively made of tanned reindeer 
skins (no other material permitted). 
Ithink these facts might be of some interest. Captain Healy says in his letter; 
“Tf the Government will be compelled to feed the Eskimo it will cost over $1,000,000.” 
If the Government realize the plan of demesticating reindeer, it would probably 
bring a good yearly income to the United States, 
Yours, respectfully, N. Wiprs, 
       
I should be very much pleased to learn later on how far the project succeeds and 
what steps the Government will take. If I move to Puget Sound next fall I shail 
probably make a trip to Alaska, 
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., December 31, 1892. 
Dear Srr: Your favor of the 29th received, and in answer mee tosay, that I wrote 
to a friend im Norway about a book or pamphlet, as desired ; = think, however, it 
would be easier to get such book from England, as probably some English tourist or 
other has written about the Laplanders, who always have been an object of great 
interest to tourists traveling in Norway. 
The acclimatization of reindeer-in Alaska woald most certainly considerably 
increase the revenues from this province. soon as some thousand deer could be 
yearly slaughtered and the hides and meat brought into the market. I believe I 
have written to you hereabout on a previous occasion; the tanned skins (soft and 
with a beautiful yellow color) would no doubt find a ready sale; in Sweden they are 
paid with seven to ten kr. ($2 to $2.75) and used for military pantaloons, gloves, bed- 
pillows, etc., and the hair, owing to its great buoyant quality, is much used for 
life-saving material. Russia sends frozen reindeer meat by carloads to Germany.

If Thad capital, and if the climate in Alaska were not too severe, I would like 
very much to start such trade, in which I have some experience. 
There is also another animal which would suit admirably for Alaska—the so-called 
“Thibetian ox,” yak,” also “grunting ox” (probably while grunting as a hog). 
The animal has fect asa goat, Well fitted for climbing rocks and stones; the cow 
gives an excellent milk, which gives an excellent butter (the reindeer has not this 
it); is used in Thibet also very much for transporting purposes. This ox, which 
is to the natives in Thibet what the reindeer is to Laplanders, is admirably qualified 
to sustain cold, seems even to love the cold, and to thrive best in cold and rough 
weather; it loves to throw itself in frozen lakes and rivers, to lie in snow and sh: udy 
places, is always lying in the open air, has to seek its food for itself, only the herders 
have to take care to bring it down in the winter in the lower regions where the snow 
melis and the food is accessible. 
In Thibet these animals are completely left to themselves; if taken some care of_ 
they might multiply quicker and be much improved. They are seen in the zoolog-— 
ical gardens in Europe, probably also in this country; might be shipped from Bom- 
bay or Calcutta, I presume. This animal might become by and by as abundant in_ 
Alaska as formerly were the buffalo on the’ Western prairies, and make Alaska a 
visiting place for sportsmen. 
With | my compliments for the New Year, I remain, dear sir, yours, respectfully, 
N. Wivts.

pany, a Swedish colonel and engineer in 1890 planted a grand park and garden, 
where all kinds of vegetables are growing, even rhubarb, asparagus, cauliflower,

THE TRIBES, MISSIONS, AND SCHOOLS OF ALASKA, 
So many inquiries have been made for general information with regard to Alaska, 
that it seems ‘expedient to make a report which contains a general survey of the 
tribes, villages, missions and schools of this unique region. 
Scattered over this vast North- Jand, in clusters of small settlements, is a popula- 
tion composed approximately of 15, 000 Innuit, or Eskimo, 2,145 Aleuts, 1,756 Creoles, 
5,100 'Linneh, 3,000 Thlingets, 788 Hydah, and! 2,000 whites, making a total of 33,623. 
THE INNUIT. 
‘ne Innuit occupy the entire coast line of Alaska, with the outlying islands along 
the Arctic coast to Bering Strait; thence southward to the Alaska Peninsnla, over the 
peninsula and eastward and northward along the Pacific Coast to Mount St. Elias, 
with the exception of a small territory on Cook’s Inlet and at the mouth of Copper 
River, where the Tinneh from the interior have forced their way to the coast. Oceu- 
pying the coast line, they aro bold navigators and skilled fishermen and sea hunters. 
The term “Innuit” is the native word for “people,” and is the name used by them- 
selves, signifying ‘‘our people.” The term “Eskimo” is one of reproach given them 
by their neighbors, meaning ‘‘raw-fish eaters.” ‘The Innuit of Alaska are a much 
finer race physically than their brethren of Greenland and Labrador. They are tall 
and muscular, many of them being 6 feet and over in height. They have small black

complexion S instances the men have full beards and mustaches. In some 
sections the n alabret under each corner of the mouth, in a hole cut through

they are a good-natured people, always smiling when spoken to. They are fond 
ing, running, jumping, and all athletic spo While they speak a common 
go from the Arctic to the Pacific, each locality has its own dialect. 
The native dress is the parkas, made ‘of the skins of animals and sometimes of the 
breasts of birds and skins of fishes. However, where they have access to the stores 
of traders the more progressive buy ready-made clothing. 
Their residences have the outward appearance of a circular mound of earth covered 
with grass, with a small opening at the top for the escape of smoke. The entrance 
is a small and narrow hallway to the main room, which is from 12 to 20 feet in diame- 
ter, and is without light or ventilation. Those of the Kadiak district have one or 
two small bedrooms opening into the main room. 
The diet consists of the meat of the moose, reindeer, bear, and smaller fur-bearing 
animals; also of fish, the white whale, the w: alrus, seal, and various waterfowl. In 
the northern section they have a great aversion to salt, While they will eat with 
great relish decayed fish or putrid oil, they will spit out with a wry face a mouthful 
of choice corned beef. 
Men, women, and children are inveterate smokers. 
While they travel continually in the summer, they have permanent winter homes. 
Their religious belief is quite indefinite. Ina general way they believe in a power 
that rewards the good and punishes the bad, by sending them to different places 
after death. They are bar ans, and, with the exception of those in southern 
Alaska, have not had civilizing, edue: ational, or religious advantages, 
From the boundary line to Bering Strait, along the bleak Arctic coast, villages are 
placed here and there, wherever there is a sheltered harbor with good hunting or 
fishing; the population of these aggregates 3,000. 
At Point Barrow, the most northern por tion of land on the continent, there is a 
village’ (Nuwuk) of 31 families and 150 people. They inhabit houses or tupecs that 
are built partly under ground for warmth. The upper portion is roofed over with 
dirt, supported by rafters of whale jaws and ribs. Eight or 10 miles south of 
Nuwuk is Oot-ke-ah-ve, with a population of 300 to 400. 
This is one of the villages selected by the United States Bureau of Education for 
the establishment of a school, the contr act for which was given to the Board of 
Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church for the Woman’s Executive Committee 
of Home Missions. The money necessary for its establishment was generously con- 
tributed by Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, of New York. The first teacher was Prof. L. M. 
Stevenson, of Versailles, Ohio, who reached the place on July 30, 1890. 
In 1892’Mr. Stevenson was ‘appointed by the Government keeper of the Refuge 
Station. This station is, next to Upernavik, Greenland, the northernmost mission in 
the world. Mr. Stevenson reports it very interesting to see their black eyes flash 
and their dusky countenances brighten as they learn a new word or a new combina- 
tion of figures. They seem to pride themselves on knowing English, but manifest 
little desire to speak it, as that would be breaking off from their traditions, and 
their im-ut-koots (doctors) would let the evil one take full possession of them for 
thus abandoning the style of former days. 
The attendance for the most part was very irregular, owing to the trips that had 
to be made out to the caches where the deer meat was stored, and which they brought 
in for food, as required, and for the catching of: seals for both food and fuel. 
After the age of 4 is reached, no parent is able to tell the age of his children, and 
they are not ‘positiv ely certain beyond 3 years, so that the classification by ages in 
school is mere guesswork. Knowledge of the past is summed up in the single’ word 
je pean ee,” which may be yesterday. or ten thousand years ago, or any indefinite 
eriod. 
c Five seems to be the basis and almost the extent of their mathematical compre- 
hension, and beyond the limit of 15 the best of them become confused, and eut off 
further count by a single word, ‘‘am-a-lok-tuk,” which may be anything, from 1 
upward. It seems to mean plenty. If there is enough for the present meal it is 
“am-a-lok-tuk.” 
The coldest weather reported was 424° below zero. The long, dark (for the night 
extends from November 19 to January 23) Arctic winter wore away until April 14, 
when the’report of ‘whales seen in the lead” set everyone wild with excitement, 
nearly breaking up the school. All the pupils large enough left immediately to hunt 
whales, and a few weeks later the remaining boys and | girls left to drive the dog 
teams that were transporting the whalebone and meat to the village from the edge 
of the ice, from 12 to 20 miles out to sea. 
At this village is also located the Government refuge station for shipwrecked 
whalers. Within the past ten years some 2,000 sailors have been wrecked on this

  Arctic coast. So far they have been fortunate in finding vessels within reach to 
carry them south to civilization, but the occasion is liable to come any season when 
they will be compelled to winter here. To a large body of men this means slow star- 
vation and death. They could not subsist on the country, and there is no adequate 
provision within 1,500 to 2,000 miles; and when the long Arctic winter sets in no 
power on earth could reach them with help. To provide against any such horrible 
tragedy Capt. M. A. Healy, U. S. R. M., saw the need of having an ample supply of 
provisions stored at some central place in the Arctic region, The plan grew and took 
shape in his own mind, He enlisted his friends and the men interested in the whal- 
ing industry, particularly in New Bedford and San Francisco, and finally, after many 
vexatious delays that would have discouraged a less persistent man, Congress voted 
the money for erecting the buildings and procuring the provisions. 
In 1889 Captain Healy brought up the materials and erected the main building, 
which is a low one-story structure, 30 by 48 feet in size. The walls, roof, and floor 
are made double, as a protection against the intense cold of this high northern lati- 
tude in winter. It will accommodate 50 men comfortably; it can shelter 100 if 
necessary, The house has provisions for 100 men twelve months, and is admirably 
adapted for its purpose. 
Three hundred and ten miles south of Point Barrow, on the Arctic coast, is Point 
Hope, with a population of 300. At this village is a successful mission and school, 
conducted by Mr. John B. Driggs, M. D., under the auspices of the Protestant Epis- 
copal Missionary Society.. During the winter of 1890-91 the attendance at the school 
numbered 68. 
The school was opened on the Ist of October, 1890. The day brought with it a 
blizzard and snowstorm that lasted for nine days. During the morning the teacher 
occupied the schoolroom alone, but as time wore on and no pupils came he put on 
his furs and started for the village to hunt up the children, Upon going outside the 
house he found a boy walking on the beach. ‘Taking him into the schoolroom, he 
commenced school. At the close of the afternoon he presented his pupil with a 
couple of pancakes left from his own breakfast. The effect was equal to any reward 
of merit. That boy proved one of the most regular in attendance during the entire 
winter season. The next morning 4 presented themselves, and from that the school 
grew to 68. A mixture of flour, molasses, and water made into a sort of cake, a little 
of which was given to the pupils each evening, proved a very cheap and efficient 
method of securing regular attendance, and promoting discipline, as they had to be 
both present and perfect in their deportment and recitations to be entitled to cake. 
The scholars usually arrived from 6 to 7 in the morning and remained all day. The 
sun disappeared on the 10th of December and returned on the 3d of January, giv- 
ing them a night of twenty-four days. Lamps were required in the schoolroom 
from November 12 to February 9. The thermometer varied in the coldest weather 
from 27° to 31° below zero, the average of the winter being probably about 15° « 
below zero. During February and a portion of March a series of blizzards set in 
that were beyond description. The ice was solid across the ocean to Cape Prince of 
Wales, 200 miles distant. The effect of the gales was such that at times it seemed as 
if the schoolhouse must be blown away. Snow flew in perfect sheets. The school- 
house was located 2 miles from the village, and yet, notwithstanding the storms 
and distance, the attendance was good. For a few days the teacher hired men to 
see the little ones safely home through the storm (the 2 miles distance), but soon 
found that the precaution was unnecessary; that they were accustomed to take care 
of themselves, 
Two hundred and twenty miles south of Point Hope is situated the village of Cape 
Prince of Wales, on the American side of Bering Straits. It contains a population 
of 539 Eskimos. In 1880 the American Missionary Association (Congregational) 
established a station at this place, with Messrs. W. T. Lopp and H. R. Thornton 
teachers. School was opened on the 18th of August, 1890, with only about one-fourth 
of the population returned to the village from their summer’s hunt. 
The school being established among a wild people, who had known no restraints 
and who could not comprehend the purposes or language of the teachers in coming 
to them, at first, through misapprehension, there was a good deal of trouble. On the 
19th of September Elignak, one of the wealthiest men of the village, and one of his 
wives, both in a state of beastly intoxication, tried to force their way into the house. 
On the 23d of September some of the students became so boisterous and unruly in 
the schoolroom that they also had to be excluded from the house. And again, in 
November, drunken parties tried to break in and make a disturbance, so that for 
two months the teachers taught, ate, worked, and slept with loaded arms at hand, 
not knowing at what moment they might have to defend the property committed to 
them, and their lives. They were constantly harrassed with questions as to when 
resistance should begin and how far it would be justifiable, debating in their own 
minds whether it would be better to allow themselves to be robbed or murdered 
without resistance, or through resistance make the savages respect their manhood,

  The danger to the station was greatly increased by an epidemic of the grip, which 
carried away 26 people in two months. This was by the superstitions of the people 
attributed to the presence of the white men among them. However, through tact 
and good management and the providence of God, hostilities were prevented, and 
by January the strained situation was greatly relieved. Mutual confidence sprang 
up between the natives and the teachers. Having heard, before going to the place, 
of the bad reputation of the people (which, however, it was found they did not 
- deserve), and feeling that a people who knew nothing of schools would not endure 
for any length of time the restraints of a schoolroom, and the cost of building being 
very great (all lumber and material being sent from San Francisco, 3,000 miles), the 
schoolhouse was built-to hold about 50 pupils, and it was thought that if 50 pupils 
could be obtained among such a people, under such circumstances, it would be a very 
great success. But, to the astonishment of the teachers themselves and to the aston 
ishment of the friends of education interested in these Arctic schools, it was found 
that the total enrollment for the first year was 304 pupils, out of a population of 539 
people. The average daily attendance for the last seven months of the school was 
146, and the average daily attendance for the whole session of nine months was 105. 
As the schoolroom would hold only about 50 at a time, the teachers were compelled 
to divide the pupils into three classes and hold morning, afternoon, and evening 
sessions of school. And then, to prevent the children who belonged to the afternoon 
or evening school from smuggling themselves into the morning session, or the morn- 
ing children from remaining to the afternoon or evening session, it was found neces- 
sary to build two parallel snow walls some distance from the schoolroom door, and 
when the bell stopped ringing for school the teachers ranged themselves on either 
side, in order to sift the children that were trying to get into the schoolroom. It 
was with great difficulty that the pupils were made to understand that it was not 
proper to talk and laugh and jump over the benches in the schoolroom during school 
as much as they pleased; nor could they understand why 30 or 40 visitors could not 
lounge about the room which was needed for those who desired to study; so that 
upon several occasions it became necessary to exclude certain parties from the school- 
room; but exclusion for a few days was all that was necessary. It was considered 
a great punishment not to be able to come to school. During the epidemic a number 
of slates that the children had been allowed to take home at night were returned 
by order of the medicine men, who ascribed much of the sickness to the slates and 
the pictures which the children made upon them—they were ‘bad medicine.” 
The teachers began their school work by learning the Eskimo names of the most 
important objects in daily use and training their pupils in the English equivalents. 
From words they proceeded to phrases, and from phrases to sentences, teaching them 
to translate the Eskimo into English and vice versa. They gradually added English 
letters and numbers, together with some elementary geography and arithmetic. 
Although they had had a combined experience of thirteen years in the schoolroom 
in the States, the teachers declare that they never had more quick-witted, intelli- 
gent pupils than these wild Eskimo children. At the beginning of the school year 
only a few could count ten,in a blundering fashion, and nine-tenths of the pupils 
knew practically no English whatever. At the close of the first school year they 
had a good working yoeabulary, knew something of geography and map drawing, 
understood thoroughly the decimal basis of our numbers, could count up to one thou- 
sand, work examples in simple addition, write and read simple English words, and 
carry ona conversation in English on everyday practical matters. ‘The pupils showed - 
a remarkable desire to learn for learning’s sake. During 1891-92 the average daily 
attendance was 106, and during 1892-93, 160. 
In the summer of’ 1893 Mr. W. T. Lopp was appointed puperendent of the rein- 
deer station at Port Clarence, and, with his wife, removed to that place, leaving Mr. 
and Mrs. H. R. Thornton in charge of the mission. On the 19th of August, 1893, 
Mr. 'Thornton was assassinated by two young men whom he had expelled from school 
for disorderly conduct. The community at once showed their horror at the act by 
summarily killing both the murderers. 
After the death of her husband Mrs. Thornton returned to her parents in Maine, 
and the mission was closed for the season of 1893-94, 
This mission is an important point from which to carry Christian civilization 
across to the tribes of Siberia, 46 miles distant. 
In the narrow strait separating Asia from America is a small group of islands 
called the Diomede. On these islands are three hundred Innuit. 
The largest of the Diomede Islands belongs to Russia and the smaller one to the 
United States. They are both inhabited, and at this point the inhabitants of Russia 
and the United States are only separated by a channel 2 miles wide. 
The Eskimo of the Diomedes, with those at Cape Prince of Wales, are the great 
smugglers of the north. Launching their walrus-skin boats (umniak), they boldly 
cross to and from Siberia, trading the deerskins, sinew, and wooden ware of Alaska 
for the walrus, ivory, skins of tame reindeer and whale blubber of beria, firearms, 
and whisky. :

Nearly midway between Cape Prince of Wales and Point Hope is Kotzebue Sound, 
around which are a number of villages of the Arctic Eskimo. Some of the hills sur- 
rounding this sound rise to the height of a thousand Jeet, and are covered with a 
species of wild cotton that in its season gives the appearance of snow. 
The Noatak and Kowak rivers, both large streams, and also the Salawick, empty 
into the sound. This is one of the places where the people come in July from all 
sections of the country for thé purposes of trade and barter. The Innuit of the coast 
bring their oil, w alrus hides, and seal skins; the Tinneh their furs from the interior, 
and the Chuekchees their reindeer skins, firearms, and whisky from Asia, 
On King’s Island, south of Cape Prince of W: ales, is a village of cave dwellers, 
numbering 200. This is one of the most remarkable settlements in America. The 
island is a great mass of basalt rock, about a milein length, rising from the sea with 
perpendicular sides from 700 to 1,000 feet above the water. On the.south side the 
wall is broken down by a ravine rising g at an angle of 45°, which is filled with loose 
rock. A great permanent snow bank “fills the ravine from the bottom to the top of 
tho mountain. On the west side of the snow is the village of Ouk-ivak, which con- 
sists of some 40 dwellings or underground houses, partly excavated in the side of 
the hill, and built up with stone walls. Across the top of these walls are large peles 
made from the driftwood that is caught floating around the island, Upon these are 
placed hides and grass, which are in turn covered with dirt. A low tunnel or dirt- 
covered hallway, 10 to 15 feet long, leads directly under the center of the dwelling. 
This is so low that it is necessary to stoop and often creep in entering. At the end 
of the hall, directly overhead, is a hole about 18 inches in diameter. This is the 
entrance to the dwelling above. 
Frequently in summer these caves become too damp to live in. The people then 
erect a summer house upon the top of the winter one. The summer house consists 
of walrus hides stretched over a wooden frame, making a room from 10 to 15 feet 
square. Thesc summer houses are guyed to rocks with rawhide ropes, to prevent 
them from being blown off into the sea. The entrance is an oval hole in the walrus 
hide, about 2 feet above the floor, Outside of the door is a narrow platform about 
2 fect wide, leading back to the side of the hill. Some of these platforms are from 
15 to 20 feet above the roofs of the huts below them. Across the ravine from the 
village, at the base of the perpendicular sides of the island, is a cave, into the mouth 
of which the surf dashes and roars, Atthe back of the cave is a large bank of per- 
petual snow. This cave is the storehouse of the whole village. Walrus and seal 
meat is stored away in rooms excavated in the snow. As the temperature in the 
cave never rises above the freezing point, meat so stored soon freezes solid and 
keeps indefinitely. 
South of King’s Island is that of St. Lawrence, the largest island in Bering Sea. 
On the extreme northwest corner is the village of Chib-u-Chak, with 21 houses, con- 
taining 2 population of 270, of whom 125 are under 21 years of age. The houses are 
from 20 to 50 feet in size. For a distance of 5 or 6 feet above the ground the walls 
are built of driftwood, whalebone, or timbers and planks from shipwrecked vessels. 
These are placed on end, side by side, forming an inclosure in a cireular or oblong 
form. The cracks between these planks are stuffed with moss. Therafters are cov- 
ered with walrus and seal skins, forming the roof. Some roofs are in the shape of a 
cone and others of adome. Tho interior is partitioned off around the sides with 
deerskin curtains, forming sleeping apartments. All around, inside and outside, 
are filth, dirt, sleds, spears, snow: shoes, and household utensils. The houses and. 
tents are located with no reference to order or street lines. ‘The sleds are shod with 
bone. Of a few small ones the whole runner was made of a walrus tusk, 
If the building is a very large one there is a row of supporting poles on each side, 
midway between the center and sides. Over the rafter poles are stretched walrus 
hides. These are held in position by rawhide ropes, attached towhich and hanging 
down the sides of the building are the vertebrw of whales, large stones, and old 
iron from shipwrecked vessels. This anchorage both stretches the skins and pre- 
vents them from being blown off. These skins, being translucent, let in a great deal 
of light. There are no windows in the house, and but a small opening, about 24 feet 
above the ground, fora door. Fire, when they have any, is made on the dirt floor in 
the center of the room. Each building is oecupied by several families. Near the 
house is.a scaffold made of posts of the jawbones of the whale. These are 7 to 10 
feet high and 10 feet wide. On these are placed the skin boats, harness of the 
dogs, meat, etc., so as to be out of the reach of dogs. Upon one of these, attached 
to the whalebone cross-beam, was a child’s swing, made of walrus rope. 
I saw several excavations where underground houses had once been, and one such 
house still standing with tho roof partially fallen in. The sides were composed of 
walrus skulls laid up like a stone wall. In this house were some corpses, together 
with spear, arrowheads, and personal belongings of the dead. 
Passing from house to house, I was followe ed by a crowd of dirty but bright-looking 
children, From the eldest to the child which was just able to talk they asked for

  tobacco, which is used by both sexes and all ages down to the nursing child. Five 
little girls, from 4 to 10 years of age, gave a native dance. They commenced with a 
swinging motion of the “body from side to side, throwing their weight alternately 
upon Yeach foot. ‘This was accompanied by an explosive grunt or squeak, as if the air 
was being violently expelled from the lungs. As they warmed up they whirled 
around, writhed and twisted their bodies, and distorted their faces into all manner 
of shapes and expressions, until they would fall down ‘With dizziness. 
In 1891 I erected a good schoolhouse and teacher's residence at the village, but up 
to the winter of 1893-94 no suitable teacher and his wife have been found for the 
place. This building, through the liberality of two ladies, is the property of the 
Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, and there is a fair prospect that a teacher 
will be sent this season. 
In 1878 the island was the scene of a great tragedy. Starvation and pestilence 
carried away over 400 of the people. When the revenue cutter visited the island in 
1880, in four villages not a man, woman, or child was left to tell the tale; the corpses of 
the population alone were found. All the villages on the island, with the single 
exception of Chib-u Chak, had been swept out uf existence. 
In 1884 Captain Healy reports, ‘“‘At the villages along the north shore no sign of 
living beings could be found, but the still decaying bodies of tue unfortunate Eskimo 
were lying in and about the falling houses.” 
From Bering Strait around the shores of Norton Sound are a number of villages, 
aggregating a | population of 633. 
On the northern side of Norton Sound i 
Swedish Evangelical Mission Union erect 
the summer of 1893, Eighty-five mil of Golovin Bay, on the east coast of 
Norton Sound, is the village of Unalakl. ‘A mission station was established at 
Unalaklik in 1886 by the Swedish Evangelical Mission Union, with Rev. Axel E. 
Karlson in charge. 
In 1893 he was assisted by the Rev. August Anderson, the Rey. David Johnson, 
‘N. U. Hultburg, Miss Malvena Johnson, and Miss Hannah Swenson. During the 
past winter a number of Eskimo were baptized and admitted into the church. They 
have a home school with 47 pupils. 
Some of the pupils came from distant villages, one family coming 300 miles across 
country from the Arctic region. During the long winter evenings the children are 
taught various kinds of industrial work, and a number of the boys as well as the 
girls take lessons in sewing. Invitations have been received by the teachers for the 
establishment of branch schools in distant villages. 
Forty miles south of Unalaklik is St. Michael, a trading post orignally founded 
by the Russians in 1835. The place consists of a few log houses, inclosed by a 
stockade, the property of the Alaska Commercial Company, and a chapel of the Russo- 
Greek Church, with an occasional service by a priest from Ikogmute. This is the 
point where the ocean-going steamers transfer freight with the small steamers that 
ply on the Yukon River. Tothis point the furs collected at the trading posts of the 
interior, some of them 2,000 miles distant, are brought for reshipment to San Francisco. 
This is also the dividing line between the Innuit of the Arctic and the Pacific. Half 
a mile from the trading post is a native village of 30 houses and one dance house or 
town hall, 
On July, 1886, an agreement was entered into between the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion and'tlie Mission ry Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church for the estab- 
lishment of a school in the great Yukon Valley. Owing to the impossibility of 
getting the supplies into that inaccessible region, the school was maintained for 
1886-87 at St. Michael, on the coast, by the Rey. and Mrs. Octavius Parker. In the 
summer of 1887 the Rey. John H. Chapman was added to the mission, and the station 
‘was removed to Anvik. 
In the summer of 1889 the Rey. Mr. Parker retired from the mission on account of 
the health of his family. In 1890 Mr. Mareus O. Cherry was commissioned to Anvik, 
remaining two years. 
In the summer of 1891 the Rev. Jules L. Prevost was sent out to take charge of 
St. James Mission, near the junction of the Yukon and Tanana rivers, which had 
been previously established by the Rey. and Mrs. T. H. Canham, of the Church of 
England. 
Around the head waters of the Yukon’River the Church Missionary Society of 
London has established three missions on the borders of Alaska, one at Rampart 
House, on the Porcupine River; another at Buxton, near the mouth of “Forty Mile 
Creek,” and the third at Harper’s Trading Station. The latter is oceupied by Rev. 
and Mrs. T. H. Canham. Mrs. Canham was the first white woman to cross the Rocky 
Mountains on snowshoes north of the Arctic circle in midwinter. 
Buxton is the headquarters of Bishop Bompas, the mission school being taught by 
Miss Susan Mellett. 
Rampart Honse was the field of the Rev. G. C. Wallis, who in 1893 returned to 
England on account of his wife’s health.

  In 1886-87 the Roman Catholics entered the Yukon Valley and established missions 
and schools at Nulato, Kosorifisky, and Cape Vancouver. 
At Kosorifisky they have 7: 3 pupils inthe homeschool. Their missions are in charge 
of four or five priests and nine sisters of the order of St. Ann. 
In 1892 they opened a mission in the valley of the Kuskokwim. 
South of the Yukon River and running parallel with it are the valleys of the 
Kuskokwim and Nushegak rivers, occ upied by the Moravian missionaries. 
In thespring of 1885 the Rey. and Mrs. W. H. Weinland and the Rey. and Mrs. J. H. 
Kailbuek and Mr. Hans Torgerson were sent to the Kuskokwim River as the first mis- 
sionaries to the Eskimo of Alaska. 
That fall Mr. Torgerson, the carpenter, was accidentally drow a and Messrs. 
Weinland and Kilbuck were left alone to erect the mission buildings as best they 
could before the Arctic winter set in. 
In the winter of 1886-87 Mr. Weinland’s health so far failed that he with his family 
left the station and in the summer of 1887 returned to California, where he has been 
doing valuable service among the Mission Indians. 
During the winter of 1887- “88 the Rev. and Mrs. Kilbuck alone brav: ely held the 
fort. In spite of the 30° below zero and perils of storm and hostile shamans, Mr. 
Kilbuck would walk 25 miles on snowshoes to preach at a neighboring village. It 
was a long, dark winter, but the dawn was at hand, On Good Friday preaching on 
the crucifixion and explaining that Christ died on the cross to take away the guilt 
of sin, Some of the older men exclaimed: ‘‘Kou-ja-nah! [thanks]. We, too, desire to 
have our badness taken away by that blood.” 
Mrs. Kilbuck’s health becoming impaired under the great hardships which she 
was heroically enduring, in the summer of 1889 Mrs. Bachman, wife of Bishop Henry 
T. Bachman, volunteered to give a year at Bethel. She was accompanied by Miss 
Carrie Detterer, who went out as a permanent laborer. In 1890 the mission force 
was again increased by the arrival of Miss Lydia Lebeus, and in 1892 by Miss Mary 
Mack, } and in 1893 by Mr. and Mrs. B. Helmich and Miss P. C. King. 
In 1893, in addition to the six American missionaries, there were two native helpers 
and 26 native communicants. 
At the native villages of Kikichtagamute and Akaigamute, the Christians, owing 
to the persecutions of the shamans, are preparing to leave their homes and eétabliah 
a Christian village. 
At Onga vigamute, the uppermost station on the Kuskokwim River, a log mifasion 
house, 18 by 30 feet, has been erected. This station is being cared for by “the Rev. 
and Mrs. Weber. Another station has been established at Quinehaha, at the mouth 
of the Kuskokwim. 
In the summer of 1886 the Moravians located and erected a mission station at the 
mouth of the Nushagak River. The mission was formally opened in the summer of 
1887 with the arrival of the Rev. and Mrs. Wolff and Miss Mary Huber. 
In 1889 the new station at Carmel was strengthened by the arrival of the Rey. John 
Herman Schechert, and in 1890 by Miss Emma Huber. 
At Carmel is an industrial home, with 18 pupils, and a church with 17 communi- 
cants. 
In 1893 a sawmill was erected near Bethel. 
A short portage across the Alaska Peninsula brings us to the settlements of the 
civilized Innuit and Creoles, 
In 1784 Gregory Shelikoff formed a settlement on Kadiak Island and commenced 
the subjugation and civilization of the people. Soon after he organized a school, 
which was the firstin Alaska. The first church building in Alaska was also erected 
on this island. For a long time it was the Russian capital, the chief seat of their 
powerand operations. A tombstone in the Russian cemetery bears date of 1791. The 
present village of Kadiak (St.Paul) numbers 323 people. They have a few cattle, 
and cultivate small gardens. They have a large church and a resident priest; also 
stores of the Alaska Commercial Company, a Pdeputy collector of customs, and a 
register of the tides. Kadiak is the headquarters of the Alaska Commercial Com- 
pany for the district comprising Cooks Inlet and Prince Williams Sound. 
The Russian school has been extinct for more than a quarter of a century, and for 
years the people have been anxiously looking for another. 
It was therefore with peculiar pleasure that on the 22d of September, 1886, an 
experienced teacher was landed with the necessary school books, ete. 
Prof. W. E. Roscoe, with his wife and baby, received a warm welcome from the 
people. He was not in the village twelve hours before a delegation of the citizens 
waited upon him to know if a night school could not be established for the married 
people to learn English. A trader 100 miles away, reading in a San Francisco paper 
that the Government would open a school at Kadiak, sent his wife and two half- 
grown daughters to attend the school. In their eagerness not to lose a day, they 
reached Kadiak six months in advance of the teacher. 
Opposite Kadiak is Wood Island, with 125 people, of whom 50 are children. In 
1893 a large, substantial building was erected on Wood Island by the American Bap-

  tist’s Woman’s Home Mission Society, as a mission for orphans, waifs, and other 
children of that region. 
Professor Roscoe, of Kadiak, writes, under date of September 29, 1890: “In every 
settlement through this part of the country may be found poor, defenseless children, 
clothed only in rags, with no one to provide suitable food or clothing, and living 
entirely on such charity as may be found among a heathen people. ‘There are many 
destitute children, made so by the drunkenness and the vagabond character of their 
parents. In addition toa kind of beer which the natives themselves make from 
sugar and graham flour, they succeed in buying large quantities of whisky from 
sailors and the more reckless class of traders. ‘The salmon canneries are, generally 
speaking, a curse to the natives. The Chinese employees bring, or rather smuggle, 
immense quantities of ‘samshu’ into the country, and peddle it out to the natives. 
In the Aleut settlement of Afognak, the natives have sold the bedding from their 
huts to obtain the vile stuff. The winter is upon them, and until recently they have 
been so demoralized with liquor that they had not laid in the usual winter’s supply 
of dried fish, their main subsistence. Without money and provisions and clothing, 
what misery and want will there be in that village this winter, all because of intoxi- 
eating liquors. 
“White hunters, recently arrived from the westward, tell me it is the same out 
there. The natives are demoralized by drink. Now, the futuré of this race is that, 
practically, they will perish from off the face of the globe unless they are Christian- 
ized, and that soon, It isa fact that the children do not generally show this terrible 
craving for strong drink. The pupils of my school are ashamed of their parents’ 
drinking, and we never see them drink any. It seems, therefore, to be rather an 
acquired habit than an inherited appetite. It is only right and just that our Goy- 
ernment take orphan children and inebriates’ children and put them ina good indus- 
trial school under religious teachers, who, in addition to moral and intellectual 
training, will teach them the cultivation of soil, the rearing of cattle, sheep, hogs, 
and poultry, the elements of some of the mechanical arts; and the girls the art of 
sewing and cooking.” 
Just north of Wood Island is Spruce Island, where a Russian monk kept a small 
school for thirty consecutive years, giving instruction in the rudimental arts and 
agricultural industries. The monk is dead and the school discontinued. 
Near by are the two villages of Afognak, with a population of 321, of whom 146 
are children. These cultivate 100 acres in potatoes and turnips. They have a large 
Greek church. 
September 25, 1886, I landed school desks and supplies for a school through the 
breakers. 
In 1890 a comfortable school building and teacher's residence were erected by the 
Government. In 1891 the teacher reported that while the people were quiet and 
inoffensive, yet a hundred years of misrule has broken their spirit and left them 
without hope or courage to better their condition; intemperance is very rife among 
them, and many of the pupils of the school, during the winter, were on the verge of 
starvation because their parents had wasted nearly all their living on intoxicating 
liquors. On visiting his pupils at their homes, he often found both parents dead 
drunk and the hungry children shivering with cold. Until some efficient means can 
be employed to prevent the introduction of liquors among them, the school work 
will be carried on under very great disadvantages. 
At Karluk-a comfortable teacher's residence and school building have been erected. 
The chief industry is canning salmon, which gives employment to children as well 
as adults, so that during the run of the salmon in summer school is suspended. It 
is an important center for a school, and it is hoped that much can be accomplished 
in the future. 
    ALEUTS AND CREOLES. 
From the Innuit we pass to the consideration of the Aleuts. The origin of the 
word “Aleut” is not known. They designate themselves by the term ‘“‘ Unung-un,” 
the native word for “our people.” 
They occupy the Aleutian chain of islands and portions of the Alaska Peninsula, 
from the Shumagin Islands, 1,650 miles westward to Attu. 
The average height of the men is about 5 feet 6 inches. They have coarse black 
hair, small eyes, high cheek bones, flat noses, thick lips, large mouths, broad faces, 
and light yellowish-brown complexions, with a strong resemblance to the Japanese. 
The marriage relation is respected, and as arule each family has its own house, 
with two to three rooms. They use in their houses a small cast-iron cook stove or 
neat wrought-iron cooking range, granite-ware kettles, white crockery-ware dishes, 
pewter or silver-plated ware, and feather beds covered with colored spreads. Their 
walls are adorned with colored pictures, and their houses lighted with kerosene in 
glass lamps. Many homes possess an accordion, a hand organ, or music box, some

of the latter costing as high as $200. They dress in American garments, and their 
women study with great interest the fashion plates and some try to imitate the latest 
styles. z 
The village of Unalaska has a population of 60 white men and 5 white women and 
251 Aleuts and Creoles, of whom 132 are children. ‘They have a church, priest's res- 
idence, the stores, residences, warehouses, and wharves of the Alaska Commercial 
Company, 18 frame residences, and 50 barrabaras. It is the most important settle- 
ment in western Alaska and the commercial center of all trade now in that region 
or that shall develop in the future. It is the natural outfitting station for vessels 
passing between the Pacific and Arctic oceans. In the mountains back of the vil- 
eee is a volcano in eruption. 
In September, 1889, Mr. John A. Tuck reached the village and opened a day school. 
The following season a few girls were taken into his family and a mission home 
opened under tho auspices of the Methodist Woman’s Home Mission Society. The - 
Home family has increased until, in 1893, 26 girls enjoyed its advantages. 
Two hundred and twenty-two miles north of Unalaska are the celebrated Pribilof, 
or, as they are more popularly called, Sea Islands. 
The village of St. Paul, on an island of theosame name, is laid out in regular streets 
like an American village, and has 64 houses and « priest’s residence. The popula- 
tion is 18 white men, 4 white women, and 222 Aleuts. 
‘Twenty-seven miles to the southeast is the companion island of St. George, with 8 
white men and 85 Aleuts. They havea church and school. These islands areleased 
by the United States Government to the North American Commercial Company. 
The revenue of these islands since 1870 has returned to the Government the entire 
sum paid to Russia for the whole country. 
From these two islands come nearly all the seal skins of commerce. There is a 
small school on each island supported at the expense of the company, with 98 per 
cent of the children in attendance. 
In the immediate vicinity of the Unalaska, on the island of Spirkin, is Borka. 
This village is noted for its cleanliness, With their white-scrubbed and neatly 
sanded floors, their clear, clean windows, neat bedding, tidy rooms, and abundance 
of wild-flower bouquets on tables and window sills, they may properly be called the 
Hollanders of Alaska. 
To the eastward, near the southern end of the Alaska Peninsula, is Belkoffski, with 
a population of 185. In addition to the buildings of the great trading firms, the 
village has 30 frame houses and 27 barrabaras. 
In 1880 they raised among themselves $7,000 for the erection of a church. One- 
half of them ean read and write in the Aleutian language, and they support a small 
school. West of the village is the magnificent volcano Shilhaldin in active erup- 
tion, and to the north Pavloff volcano is throwing out smoke like the smokestack of 
an ocean steamer. 
At Unga, with its 74 children, I established a school October 20, 1886, Prof. John 
H. Carr (the teacher) and his wife belonging to the Methodist Church. 
The Methodist Woman’s Home Mission Society have erected a teacher’s residence 
and named it “The Martha Ellen Stevens’ Cottage,” in memory of Mrs. Carr, who 
died there. 
For the southern coast of Alaska between Sitka and Unalaska there is a monthly 
mail during the seven summer months of the year. To the north of the Aleutian 
Islands there is only one mail a year. - 
In the Aleutian district are 1,890 Aleuts and 479 Creoles.    
TL 
  NNEH. 
“Tinneh” is the native word for “people.” The Tinneh of Alaska are tall, well 
formed, strong, and courageous, with great powers of endurance. They are great 
hunters and fishers. Polygamy prevails among them, the men frequently having 
more than one but seldom more than three wives, Wives are taken and discarded 
at pleasure. Among some of them female infanticide is occasionally practiced. The 
bodies of the dead are buried in boxes above ground, Shamanism and witchcraft, 
with all their attendant barbarities, prevail. They also believe in a multitude of 
spirits, good and bad. 
On the lower course of the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers, and in the great range 
of country north and south bordering on the Innuit of the coast, are the western 
Tinneh, the Ingalik of the Russians, numbering i in three bands about 1,800. 
From the junction of the Yukon and Tanana rivers, westward to the ’British line, 
from the Innuit on the Arctic shore almost to the Lynn Canal on the south, is the 
home of the Kutchin families. They number, with the Ah-tena, on Copper River, 
about 3,300. Some of these people have been taught to read by the missionaries of 
the Church Missionary Society of England.

  1740 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
For years the Ohaxch Missionary Society of England has had stations at Fort 
McPherson and La Pierre House, bordering on northeastern Alaska, and their 
missionaries ee occasional trips on the Upper Yukon and its tributaries. 
THLINGET. 
The Thlinget, composed of 10 clans, occupy the islands of the Alexander Archi- 
pelago and coasts adjacent. They number 5,834. 
Immediately associated with these are 788 Hydah, occupying the southern end of 
Prince of Wales Island. 
The Thlinget are a hardy, self-reliant, industrious, self-supporting, well-to-do, 
warlike, superstitious race, whose very name is a terror to the civilized Aleuts to 
the west as well as the savage Tinnah to the north of them. 
At the base of Mount St. Elias is Yakutat. This is a station of the Swedish Evyan- 
gelical Union, with Rey. and Mrs, Albin Johnson, Rev. K. J. Hendrickson, and Miss 
Selma Peterson, teachers. Mrs. Johnson (Agnes Wallin) was from Jankaping, 
Sweden, and made a journey of 9,000 miles to. join Rev. Mr. Johnson, to whom she 
was married upon her arrival at the m ion, on the 18th of May, 1891. A large, sub- 
stantial boarding house, 35 by 14 feet in size, and two and a half stories high, 
erected in 1891, was burned in the winter of 1892-93, A new building was at once 
commenced, 
      CHILKAT, 
Occupying the extreme northern section of Lynn Canal and the valleys of the 
Chilkat and Chilkoot rivers is the Chilkat tribe, numbering 988. They are great 
traders, being the ‘‘middle men” of their region, carrying the goods of commerce to 
the interior and exchanging them for furs, which are brought to the coast, and in 
turn exchanged for more merchandise. Their country is on the highway of the gold 
seekers to the interior. 
In the summer of 1880, a trading post having been established among them, I 
arranged for a school to be taught by the wife of the trader, Mrs, Sarah Dickinson, 
native. 
The mission proper, however, commenced July 18, 1881, with the arrival of Rev. 
Eugene 8. Willard and family. 
In 1882 Miss Bessie M. Mathews, of Monmouth, Ili., was sent out to take charge 
of a boarding department, which was opened in 1883. The station is called Haines. 
Thirty miles up the Chilkat River, for a time, a school was taught by Louis and Tillie 
Paul, both natives. 
During 1885-86 Mr. Willard and family returned East to regain their health, injured 
by exposure and hardships, and the mission was closed. I]t was reopened again 
in 1887 by Mr. and Mrs, F. F. White, who remained two years. In 1891 Rey. W. W. 
Warne and wife were sent to Haines and the work resumed. In 1893 the converts 
asked to be organized into a church, 
  HOONAH, 
One hundred miles southwest are the Hoonahs, occupying both sides of Cross Sound, 
and numbering 908. In 1881 I erected a schoolhouse and teachers’ residence at their 
principal village, on Chichagoff Island, and placed Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. Styles, 
of New York City, in charge. In 1884 Rey. and Mrs. John W. McFarland were sent 
from Wrangell to Hoonah, and are now in charge of’ the school. 
One of the peculiarities’ and discouragements Sof this and several other stations in 
Alaska is that in summer the people all leave their houses in search of work and pro- 
visions. Dr. and Mrs. McFarland partially overcame this difficulty by taking a canoe 
and following their people to their hunting and fishing camp. 
‘There as elsewhere faithful work bears fruit, and in 1893 Mr. McFarland reported 
a church of 161 native communicants redeemed from heathenism, 
AUKE. 
A few miles to the eastward, on Admiralty Island, are the Aukes, numbering 640. 
In that region valuable gold mines have been opened and an American mining vil- 
lage established in Juneau. A summer school was taught by Mrs. W. H. R. Corlies 
during 1882 and 1883. 
In the spring of 1886 the Board of Home Missions of the Presbyterian Church 
commissioned Rev. Joseph P. White missionary to the whites at Juneau, and Rey. 
E. S. Willard to the natives. 
During that season Mr. Willard took down the mission premises at Tstk-nfik- 
Siiuk’-y, removed them to Juneau, and from the materials erected a neat church for 
the natives. 
A small house (which has since been replaced by a commodious building) was 
erected adjacent to the church for a mission home for native children. Assisted by

Mrs. Willard, Mrs. Elizabeth Matthews, and Miss Margaret Dunbar, Mr. Willard has 
built up a church of 52 native communicants (1893) and a flourishing mission home, 
from which a number have been sent to the training school at Sitka. 
TAKU. 
A few miles to the south, on the mainland, is the Taku tribe, numbering 269. A 
summer school was held among them in 1880 by Rey. and Mrs. W. H. R. Corlies, of 
Philadelphia. In 1882, pressed by the importunities of the leading men of the tribe, 
he took up his abode among them, and erected school and residence buildings at 
Tstk-nik-Siuk’-y. 
In 1884 circumstances required their return to Philadelphia, the people in the 
meantime having removed to Juneau. In 1886 the mission buildings were taken 
there by Mr, Willard. 
HOOCHINOO. 
On the southwestern side of Admiralty Island are the Hoochinoo, numbering 666. 
The main village is at Killisnoo, where the Northwest Trading © ompany has estab- 
lished a large fish-oil manufactory. In the neighborhood are extensive coal fields 
and valuable gold mines, I establisheda public: school in this place in January, 1886. 
In 1892 Rev. L. F. Jones and wife were placed in charge of the school, and in 1894 
there was a call for a church organization.    
  KAKE, 
To the south, on Kuiu and Kupreanoff Islands, are the Kake, numbering 568. In 
the winter of 1892-93 a school was opened for the Kakes, with Charles H. Edwards 
in charge. A few months afterwards, Mr. Edwards being shot by whisky smugglers, 
the school was closed and has not yet been resumed. 
STIKINE, 
Eastward, around the mouth and lower course of the Stikine River, are the 
Stikine. They number 317. Their principal village is at Fort Wrangell, on an 
island of the same name. 
In the fall of 1877 1 opened for the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions a mission 
school, with Mrs. A. R. McFarland in charge. In 1878 Rev. S. Hale Young, of West 
Virginia, was sent out. The same season a boarding department for girls was estab- 
lished by Mrs. A. R. McFarland. In 1879 Miss Maggie A. Dunbar, of Steubenville, 
Ohio, was added to the teaching force. The same year the erection of a suitable 
building was commenced, which was finished and occupied the following year; also 
the same year Rey. W..H. R. Corlies and family arrived from Philadelphia. Mrs. 
Corlies opened a school on the beach for visiting natives, and her husband a night 
school for adults. He also served as missionary physician to the place until his 
removal to the Taku. 
In 1882 Rey. John W. McFarland and Miss Kate A. Rankin were added to the mis- 
sionary force, In the fall of 1884 the Girls’ Home was removed to Sitka, together 
with Mrs, A. R. McFarland and Miss Rankin. Mr. J. W. McFarland and his wife 
(née Dunbar) were given charge of the mission at Hoonah. 
In 1888 the Rey. 8S. Hale Young was succeeded by Rey. Allan McKay, and in 1892 
he in turn was followed by Rey. Clarence Thwing. Under the labors of Rey. and 
Mrs. Thwing the old church is regaining its former prosperity. 
METLAKAHTLA, 
In the spring of 1887 the Tesimpeans, who kad been civilized and Christianized by 
Mr. William Duncan at Metlakahtla, British Columbia, becoming alarmed at the 
encroachments of the Colonial Government and the arbitrary measures of the Church 
of England, gave up their comfortable homes, abandoned their improvements and 
property that they could not carry with them, and empty-handed went out into the 
unbroken wilderness for conscience sake, Crossing the international boundary line 
into Alaska, they settled upon Annette Island, 60 miles north of their former home. 
On the 7thof August Mr. William Dunean arrived, and amid general rejoicing and 
the firing of guns the “Stars and Stripes” were floated over this people, that thus 
publicly transferred their allegiance from Canada to the United States. 
During the first season the heavy forest was felled and over a hundred log houses 
were erected for a temporary shelter of the inhabitants. 
Through the pecuniary assistance of friends in New York, Boston, Portland, and 
elsewhere, a sawmill, salmon cannery, and other industries have been established, 
a church, ’schoolhouses, and other public buildings erected, and the old log dwell: 
ings are rapidly being replaced by comfortable painted frame dwellings. 
The census of 1890 gives this model village a population of 828.

TONGASS. 
Two hundred miles south of Fort Wrangell are the Tongass, numbering 273. Some 
of these cross over to British Columbia, and find school privileges at Port Simpson, 
n station of the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Canada. In 1884 a school was estab- 
lished among them, with Louis and Tillie Paul as teachers. 
In December, 1886, Prof. S. A. Saxman was placed in charge of the public school. 
My. Saxman and Mr. Paul being drowned a few months after, the school and mission 
were discontinued. 
HYDAH. 
West of the Tongass, on the southern half of the Prince of Wales Island, are the 
Hydah, numbering 788. They are a large, well-formed, and handsome race, with 
light complexion, and have long been noted for their bravery and ferocity in war. 
Terrorizing all the neighboring tribes, they were,known as the ‘ Bulldogs” of the 
North Pacific. Years ago they did not hesitate to attack and plunder English and 
American vessels. In 1854 they held the captain and crew of an American vessel in 
eaptivity until ransomed by the Hudson Bay Fur Company. Their villages are 
remarkable for the number of totem sticks. These are carved logs from 1 to % feet 
in diameter and from 20 to 60 feet high. Some of them contain hollow cavities, in 
which are placed the ashes of cremated dead chiefs; others are heraldic, and repre- 
sent the family totem or orders. In some casesa large oval opening through one of 
these sticks forms the entrance to the house; in others the pole is at one side of the 
entrance. The house is a large, low, plank building, from 40 to 50 feet square, with 
a fireplace in the center of the floor, and a large opening in the roof for the escape 
of thesmoke. Some have inserted windows and doors in their buildings, and pro- 
cured bedsteads, tables, stoves, dishes, and other appliances of civilized lif 
Their food consists largely of fish, dried or fresh, according to the season. Wild 
berries and deer are plentiful. The berries are preserved in fish oil for winter use. 
Their coast also abounds with good clams. They raise large quantities of potatoes. 
The Hydah are noted for their skill in carving wood, bone, gold, silver, and stone. 
The finest of the great cedar canoes of the Northwest Coast are manufactured by them. 
They practice polygamy and hold slaves. The husband buys his wife, frequently 
while a mere girl, from her parents, If she does not suit, she can be returned and tho 
price refunded. They are inveterate gamblers. 
On the 22d of August, 1881, a mission was established among them, in connection 
with the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions, at the village of Howkan, with Mr. 
James E. Chapman in charge as ateacher. The station was called Jackson by the 
missionaries. In the spring of 1882 Rev. J. Loomis Gould and family, of West Vir- 
ginia, were sent to the Hydah. The same year some ladies in Brooklyn, N. Y., pro- 
vided a sawmill for the station; and in the fall of that year Miss Clara A. Gould 
was added to the teaching force. 
In September, 1885, the mission day school was changed into a public school, Miss 
Gould continuing the teacher. In 1886 Mrs. A. R. Me¥arland removed from Sitka 
and established a home for girls, with Miss C. Baker as assistant. Mr. Gould has 
gathered around him a native church of 54 communicants, 
HANEGAH,   In the northern portion of Prince of Wales Island are the Hanegah, numbering 
587. Their winter village-is Tuxikan. In summer they congregate at the salmon 
cannery and sawmill at Klawack, 
In November, 1889, I left at Tuxikan Rev. L. W. Currie, of Texas, to establish a 
public school. Mr. Currie was a minister of the Southern Presbyterian Church, 
with a large experience among the Indians of the Indian Territory and of Texas. 
As no white man had ever lived in their village, there was no comfortable house to 
be had, and the mission family were compelled to go into a native house. 
It was a large building, 80 by 37 feet in size, with plank sides and a rotten bark 
roof. On the inside of the building a raised platform about 8 feet wide extended 
around the four sides of the rcom. Inclosed by this platform and 3 feet below it 
was the main floor, forming a pit 21 by 22 feet in size. In the center of the pita 
space 8 feet square was left unfloored and covered with gravel. This was the fire- 
place, The smoke, circling around the room, passed out of a hole 6 feet square, which 
was left in the roof for that purpose. The hole that permitted the escape of the 
smoke allowed the free descent of the rain. The south side of the house extended 
on piles over the tide. Into this building, which an eastern farmer would consider 
unfit for his cattle, a choice Christian family moved without a murmur. A partition 
of sheeting was erected along the edge of the platform, forming a partition between 
them and the pit. The pit was set apart for the school and church rooms, and the 
platforms on two sides divided into rooms for the teachev’s family. On the other two 
plattorms lived the native who owned the house. He had a family of six.

  EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1743 
In 1887 Mr. Currie removed to Klawack, and erected a school and residence build- 
ing. Dying in 1887, his wife returned to Texas. 
For a couple of years the mission was continued by Mr. HW. C. Wilson, a layman, 
but in 1893 is unsupplied, 
SITKAS. 
To the north, on the western coast of Baranof, are the Sitkas, numbering 721. 
Their chief village is at Sitka, the old capital of the Russian possessions in America, 
It was their political, commercial, religious, and educational center. As early as 
1805 a school was opened at Sitka. It held a very precarious existence, however, 
until 1820, when it came under the charge of a naval officer, who kept a good school 
for thirteen years. In 1833 this school came under the direction of Etolin, who still 
further increased its efficiency. Etclin was a Creole, who by force of ability and 
merit raised himself to the highest position in the country, that of chief director 
of the fur company and governor of the colony. He was a Lutheran, the patron of 
schools and churches. While governor, he erected a Protestant church at Sitka, and 
presented it with a small pipe organ, which is still in use. 
In 1840, besides the colonial school at Sitka, was one for orphan boys and sons of 
workmen and subaltern employees of the fur company, in which were taught read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, grammar, mechanical trades, and religion. 
In 1839 a girls’ school of a similar character was established, and the number of 
boarders limited to forty. 
In 1841 a theological school was established at Sitka, which in 1849 was advanced 
to the grade of a seminary. 
This made five schools at Sitka—two for the children of the lower class, two for 
the higher class, and one seminary. 
About the time of the transfer of the country the teaehers were recalled to Russia 
and the schools suspended. 
But with the change of government came a new people. The majority of the 
Russians left the country, and their places were taken by Americans. Many came in 
from California, and on the 8th of November, 1867, less than a month from the time 
that the country. passed under the United States flag, the citizens called a mecting 
and formed a temporary local government, and on the 18th of December, 1867, a peti- 
tion formed by forty-nine persons, two of whom ‘‘made their mark,” was presented to 
the common council, asking that a citizens’ meeting might be called to empower the 
council to establish a school. On the 20th of March, 1868, the council adopted some 
school regulations and appointed three trustees, who exercised a joint control with 
a committee of officers from the military post at Sitka. During the winter of 1868-69 
aschool building was purchased. The annual reports of the trustees have disap- 
peared, and there is nothing to show the time when teaching commenced. In Octo- 
ber, 1869, the council voted that the salary of the teacher should be $75 per month 
in coin, and on March 1, 1871, it was ordered to be $25 per month, which evidently 
means that.at the latter period the post commander withdrew the $50 per month 
which had been paid from the army funds. On the 12th of August, 1871, permission 
was given the bishop of the Greek Church to teach the Russian language one hour 
each day in the public school. During 1873 the school seems to have died out. 
In 1879 and 1880 an attempt was made to establish a school for Russian children, 
which was taught by Mr. Alonzo E. Austin and Miss Etta Austin. 
In the winter of 1877 and 1878 Rey. John G. Brady was appointed to Sitka, and in 
April, 1878, a school was opened by Mr. Brady and Miss Fanny E. Kellogg. In 
December, through a combination of circumstances, it was discontinued. In the 
spring of 1880 Miss Olinda Austin was sent out from New York City and commenced 
school April 5 in one of the guardhouses with 103 children present. This number 
increased to 130. Then some of the parents applied for admission, but could not be 
received, as the room would not accommodate any more. 
In November some of the boys applied to the teacher for permission to live in the 
schoolhouse. At home, they alleged, there was so much drinking, talking, and 
carousing that they could not study. The teacher replied that she had no accommo- 
dations, bedding, or food for them. But they were so much in earnest that they said 
they would provide for themselves. Upon receiving permission, seven native boys, 
13 and 14 years of age, bringing a blanket each, voluntarily left their homes and 
took up their abode in .a vacant room of one of the Government buildings. Thus 
commenced the boarding department of the Sitka school. Soon other boys joined 
them. Capt. Henry Glass, who succeeded Captain Beardslee in the command of the 
U.S. S. Jamestown, from the first, with his officers, especially Lieut. F. M. Symonds, 
U.S.N., took a deep interestin the school. As he had opportunity, he secured boys 
from distant tribes and placed them in the institution, until there were 27 boys in 
the boarding department. 
In the winter of 1882 the schoolhouse was burned, and the boys took refuge in an 
abandoned Government stable, which was fitted up for them. In the fall of 1882,

1744 EDUCATION REPORT, 1892-93. 
  after consultation with the collector of customs, the commander of the United States 
man-of-war, and the leading citizens, I selected a new location for the school, out- 
side of village limits, and erected a two-and-a-half-story building, 100 by 50 feet in 
81ze. 
; cue location was donated to the Board of Home Missions by the Rev. John G. 
Brady. 
In the spring of 1884 the faithful labors of Rev. Alonzo E. Austin and teachers 
bore fruit. The Holy Spirit was poured out and nearly all the adult pupils were 
brought to Christ. The work extended to the native village, and many of the par- 
ents accepted Jesus as a personal Savior. 
On the 12th of August, 1884, I took charge of the mission and school, and, in con- 
nection with Mr. ‘Austin, on the 7th of September organized a church of 44 native 
and 5 white communicants. The church attendance has since grown to over 341 
members. 
On September 14 to 16 the Presbytery of Alaska drganized at Sitka and held its 
first meeting. During the same month Mrs, A. R. McFarland and her Home for 
Girls were removed from Fort Wrangell to Sitka, and the united schocls made a 
Government contract industrial and training school. 
To meet the growth of the school a second large building, 130 by 50 feet in size 
and two and one-half stories high, was erected, and so far finished that it was occu- 
pied January 1, 1885. 
In the spring of 1885, on my being appointed United States general agent of edu- 
cation in Alaska, Prof. A. J. Davis, of Pennsylvania, was appointed superintendent 
of the school. Family matters requiring his return east, he was succeeded by Mr. 
William A. Kelly, of Pennsylvania. 
As the school grew, the steam laundry, boys’ and girls’ hospital wards, two indus- 
trial buildings, church, library, and museum, eight model cottages, and other build- 
ings were erected. 
In 1890 Professor Kelly reported concerning the 164 pupils in the school: 
“Our school is distinctively coeducational. The boys and girls recite in the same 
classes, dine together in the same dining room, and, under wholesome restraint, have 
oppor tunities for social intercourse. 
“A few years of sedulous training have developed in some of our oldest pupils a 
spirit of emulation, a sense of personal responsibility, self-respect, self-reliance, and 
self-helpfulness, which command respect. Most of our large boys, advanced far 
enough to read intelligently in the second reader, are learning a trade (all being in 
school half of each day and at work half a day), and the diligence with which they 
pursue their studies, the zest with which they enter upon industrial work day after 
day, is most praiseworthy of them and encouraging to their instructors. 
“All of the shoes for the pupils of our school are handmade in our shop, under 
the direction of a competent foreman. Considerable custom work is also done. 
“Our supply of barrels and half barrels far exceeds the demand, yet we consider 
coopering an excellent trade for our young men. Owing to high freight, barrels are 
usually made at the fishing station, where needed, and coopers are in demand at 
those places, 
“We are always pressed with work in carpentry. The variety and scope of work 
have proved a most valuable source of instruction to the boys, most of whom are 
aptly adapted to mechanical industry. The boys have made commendable progress. 
Young men who can do carpenter work fairly well can find ppnoruntioy to ply their 
trade in a any of the villages of Alaska. 
“We haye eight model cottages, six of which are occupied by young married 
couples from the school. ‘These’ young folks have been thrown entirely upon their 
own responsibility and resources, and they are doing well in earning a livelihood, 
while their houses are kept clean, neat, and homelike. The environments of family 
life among the young folk, in contradistinction to that in vogue among the natives, 
tend to create new conditions and inspire new impulses among their own people. 
“The girls are trained in every department of household industry , kitchen, dinin, 
room, teachers’ room, etc. The matron and her assistants give each girl individual 
care in the details of housekeeping, thus gradually inculeating and developing a 
sense of personal responsibility. 
“Our boys do the bread baking for the school, while the girls in turn are taught 
how to bake and cook for a family. They are also trained to wait upon the table, 
and they serve the teachers and guests with grace and manners. Our young boys

that outrivals many of the public schools.

EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS IN ALASKA. 1745 
“Lessons in patriotism are constantly inculcated. The Alaskans are a loyai, 
patriotic people. Rey. A. E. Austin, the veteran missionary of the school, has 
charge of the religious and devotional exercises.” 
In 1891 Mr. Kelly resigning in order to secure needed rest, he was succeeded by 
Mr. Alfred Docking, and he a few months later by Rey. A. E. Austin, who, in his long 
service at Sitka, has built up a native church of 341 communicants. 
The mission force in 1893 consisted of Rev. A. E. Austin, Mr. R, A. Clark, Mrs. A. 
E. Austin, Mrs. M. C. Wade, Miss A. R. Kelsey, Mrs. M. D. Clark, Miss F. H. Willard 
(native), Mrs. A. T. Simpson, Mrs. T, K. Paul (native), Mr. J. A. Shields, Mr. A. T. 
“Simpson, Mr. J. E. Gamble, and Mr. W. Wells (native). 
In addition to the training school, the Greek and Papal churches each have a 
school, and the Government two schools, at Sitka. 
But of all the schools at Sitka, the Presbyterian Training School is the “City of 
Refuge” for those fleeing from death—the ‘ House of Hope” to those sitting in the © 
habitations of cruelty—the ‘House of Help” to the starving, homeless, friendless 
waif—an asylum to the escaped slave—the protector of helpless girlhood. 
A few years ago a little girl was accused of witchcraft. The tribe bound her with 
arope, <A stalwart chief, holding one end of the rope, walked in advance dragging 
the child after him, while another came behind holding the other end of the rope. 
These men were the admiration of the tribe for their bravery in holding between 
them a puny, starved girl of 10, She was rescued by Professor Austin, who was in 
charge of the school, and given a home. 
A girl of 14, when about to be sold into a life of sin, for the benefit of a distant 
relative, escaped from her grandmother, who was guarding her, and found a refuge 
in the school. 
Another, a girl of about 17, was being sold for similar purposes by her stepmother 
and aunt. The two women, quarreling over the division of the money, came to settle 
the dispute before the clerk of the court, who took the girl from her unnatural pro- 
tectors and placed her in the school. 
Another was the slave of a prominent chief. After his death his two widows 
treated her so cruelly that she ran away, and was found hidden under a house. She 
was taken into the school and furnished protection and a home. A man that married 
one of the widows claimed her as his property, and tried to get possession of her, 
but in vain. The school was her protector. 
Another, to prevent being married to her stepfather and becoming a plural wife 
with her own mother, ran away and came to the school, For a long time she did not 
dare visit her mother, and when at length she ventured to visit home they locked 
her up in a rcom to keep her. After some days she again escaped and returned to the 
school for shelter. 3 
Another girl of 15, and her sister, 10 years of age, were picked up on the beach at 
a mining camp. They were without friends or home, almost without clothing, and 
in a starving condition. Through neglect and cruel treatment the younger one was 
almost blind. These orphan sisters were taken into the school, fed, clothed, and 
kindly cared for. Medical attendance was provided, and the blind one restored to 
sight. a 
Among the boys, one had been sold as a slave twice before he was brought to the 
school. Another had been shot as a slave and a bullet sent crushing through his 
shoulder. Another had been tied up as a witch and kept four days without food, 
when he was rescued. Another, when born, was about to be killed by his parents 
to save the trouble of taking care of him. A neighboring woman took pity on the 
baby and removed him to her own house. When the school commenced he was placed 
init. Many others have come under the protection of the school through trials and 
dangers. A 
And all along the coast, if a child is to be sold into slavery, or is in danger of 
being tortured to death as a witch, or forced into a life of sin, they know that if 
they can escape and reach the Presbyterian Mission School at Sitka they are safe, 
‘ pene, at points hundreds of miles apart, a few central stations have been estab- 
ished. 
While communication is made with the outside world by means of steamer twice 
a month at some of the more important stations in southeastern Alaska, the stations 
in arctic and central Alaska are cut off almost entirely from tho great, busy, outside 
world. Once a year the curtain lifts, and they receive their supplies of provisions, 
clothes, letters, papers, etc., and then it shuts down and they are closed in for 
another twelve months. 
Inasmuch as Dr. Jackson is required to make a voyage each year to northwestern 
Alaska while the reindeer experiment is in progress, and for that reason can not 
perform his duties in southeast Alaska, I resolved to place the schools of the Sitka 
district under the immediate charge of tr. William Hamilton, the assistant agent, 
who had hitherto been stationed continuously at the bureau of education. In 
November Mr. Hamilton proceeded to southeast Alaska and spent a month in that

  region, making himself fully acquainted with the school situation, consulting with 
Mr. W. A. Kelly, the local superintendent, and with the local committees, and inspect- 
ing the schools at Sitka, Juneau, Douglas, Killisnoo, and Wrangell, the only places 
that could be reached at that season of the year. - 
Section 14 of ‘An act to repeal timber-culture laws and for other purposes,” 
approved March 3, 1891, reserves from sale ‘‘any lands belonging to the United 
States which shall be occupied by the United States for public purposes, or which 
shall be reserved for such purposes.” 
During the past year a number of incorporated companies, engaged in trading, 
fishing, and lumbering in Alaska, have availed themselves of the provisions of the 
same act, whereby they can make application for a survey and patent to 160 acres 
of land upon which their improvements are situated. : 
As some of these applications cover the site of existing villages where the Govern- 
ment has school buildings, it is important that the land necessary for these school 
buildings and playgrounds should be marked and reserved at once. Therefore, I 
would respectfully suggest that the Hon. James Sheakley, governor, the Hon. War- 
ren Truitt, judge of the United States district court, and Hon. William A. Kelly, 
United States commissioner at Wrangell, be appointed a special commission to visit 
the more important settlements of southern Alaska, select and mark sites for publie 
school buildings, and report the same to the Secretary of the Interior, that they may 
be reserved for such purposes by executive order. 
I can not urge too strongly the need of an increased appropriation for education 
in Alaska. Yor threo years in succession the amount granted by Congress for this 
purpose was $50,000. For the fiscal year 1892-93 this amount was reduced to $46,000. 
It was only by strict economy that the expenses of the school system had been kept 
within the limits of the appropriation of $50,000, and the consequence of this reduc- 
tion was the suspension of three Government schools (Klawack, Kake, and Karluk), 
the reduction of the salaries of some of the teachers and of the amounts paid to the 
contract or mission schools. The appropriation for the fiscal year 1893-94 is only 
$30,000. With this amount it will of course be impossible to reopen the suspended 
schools, and many very urgently needed repairs to the school buildings must be post- 
poned. It will also be necessary to make sweeping reductions in the amounts 
granted to the contract or mission schools, which for the past three years have been 
doing excellent work in civilizing the natives of western and arctic Alaska. 
New schools are urgently needed in at least six places (Kotzebue Sound, Nukluk- 
ayet, St. Lawrence Island, Kenai, Nutchek, and Tongas), having more than 600 
children with no school privileges. Z 
For the present year [ had submitted an estimate of $50,000. Without sufficient 
means it will be impossible to keep the present schools in efficient operation, much 
less to promote a gradual and healthy growth of the educational system, so essential 
to the utilization of that vast portion of our country.

Oahu College, Honolulu, till 1860, when, his father dying, he entered Williams 
College, and graduated 1862, under President Mark Hopkins. His observation 
and experience in Hawaii taught him in the conditions of the elevation of a 
degraded race and gave him special advantage in his labors for the negro 
and the Indian. On graduation he entered the Union Army as captain in the 
One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Infantry, was captured at Harpers 
Ferry and held three months. He became interested inthe negro, and was com- 
missioned colonel of a colored regiment and brigadier by brevet, and entered 
the service of the Freedmen’s Bureau, having charge of ten counties in south- 
east Virginia, headquarters at Hampton, before he was mustered out. In this 
service his ideas of educating the ex-slaves began to take shape, and his efforts 
to center on the development of the work of education at Ilampton with the aid 
of the American Missionary Association and the Freedmen’s Bureau, into the 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute. This came to absorb all his energies 
and to be his great life work, and by overtaxing his energies, was the cause of 
shortening his useful life. He secured the share of the income which would go 
to the colored people of Virginia from the national grant to agricultural colleges, 
amounting annually to $10,000, and by constant speaking and writing, and 
bringing-of his pupils before the public, he secured the further aid needed from 
benevolent persons. This annnally amounted to $60,000 or more for successive 
years. The wisdom of his efforts gathered around him the best assistance. The 
work commanded the widest sympathy. Reasonable people in the South were

won toit by degrees. He was early urged by the United States Commissioner 
of Education to secure productive endowment funds for his great plans, but he 
seemed more disposed to devote his efforts to current work, and at his death the 
annual yield from endowments was only about $10,000; but the buildings, well 
adapted to their purpose, number 60, and these, together with the grounds, were 
valued at $400,000, and the attandence reached 650 boarding students, of whom * 
136 were Indians. Of the number enrolled from the beginning, 720 had grad- 
uated. Ho took great pains to keep the school in touch with those who had 
been once in attandance, and thus continued its influence upon their lives ina 
special degree. When the Indian murderers imprisoned at St. Augustine, Fla., 
under Capt. R. H. Pratt, then lieutenant, were about to be returned to their 
people, and a portion of them asked to be allowed to stay longer and to go to 
school and to learn to be more like white men—what school would receive 
them? Hampton alone answered, and afterwards the instruction of Indians at 
the expense of the United States Government became a successful feature of the 
general’s work. In all General Armstrong’s labors the moral and spiritual were 
kept uppermost; the chief aim was the formation of character, and in the selec- 
tion of methods, the actual condition of people was most carefully consulted.

  Patrerson, JAMES WiLus, LL. D.—Continued. 
in 1852 he was chosen tutor at Dartmouth; was professor of mathematics, 1854- 
1859; professor of astronomy and meteorology, 1859 to 1865; meantime, was com- 
missioner of schools for his county and secretary of the Stateboard. In 1862 was 
member of the State house of representatives, and made a notable speech on Fed- 
eral relations; was elected to Congressin 1863 and the following term, and in 1867 
tothe United States Senate. He had unusnaladvantages ashe entered upon pub- 
lic life. Of large and well proportioned physique, good health, and industrious 
habits, he was capable of constant hard work, and had the voice and form which 
gave him effectiveness as a speaker; his mind was strong, receptive, on the 
alert, and well trained in accurate methods and endurance; he had read widely 
and reflected deeply; was pure in character and conscientious in conduct; his 
opinions on the current issues of the period which so tried men’s souls were 
carefully matured and patriotic. He was placed on committees in both Houses, 3 
such as that of the Committee on the District of Columbia, and Education, and 2 
Foreign Affairs, and special committees, such as that on the death of Lincoln, 
and reform, for whose duties lie was specially fitted. He, with Messrs. Garfield 
and Boutwell, secured the passage through the House of the bill establishing 
the Department, afterwards the Bureau of Education, and later, when $1,000 
had been taken from its salary and its clerks reduced to two of the lowest 
grade, and there was a disposition, even among its friends, to omit its allowance 
from the appropriation, which would have terminated its work, Mr. Patterson 
never wavered in the support of the office, and was one to whom President Grant 
gave his opinion that as the slaves had been freed and education must perform 
so important a part in the new conditions, the Bureau should be further tried. 
He was efficient in cooperating with Hon. J. Ormand Wilson, superintendent of 
schools, in promoting legislation for the education of both blacks and whites in 
the District of Columbia,and in securing improved organization and administra- 
tion, and better schoolhouses and teachers. Indeed, ho was efficient in promoting 
all those measures of his day which led to new Washington as the pride of the 
country. He was active and wise in aiding the institutions for the deaf at Ken- 
dal Green, and represented Congress in the Smithsenian directory. He did well 
his part as worker and speaker in the passage of the constitutional amendments, 
in the improvement of the Civil Service, the elevation of the Consular Service, 
in the establishment of the Freedmen’s Bureau. in the reorganizatien of the 
judicial service, and securing other departmental changesrequired. Hisspeeches 
and reports evidence his patriotism, industry, and learning, and his power as a 
writer and speaker. When he was about to retire from the Senate he was made 
the subject of a most singular and cruel piece of injustice. In 1872 it was found 
that various Members of Congress held stock in the Credit Mobilier, a company 
organized under the laws of one of the States for the construction of the Union 
Pacific Railroad. Great excitement followed, and a committee of investigation 
was ordered in each House. The Senate committee, in the last overcrowded 
hours of the Senate, when Mr. Patterson’s service was to terminate, offered a 
resolution to expel him, when there was no opportunity for examination or reply. 
The resolution was never either considered or adopted. In the whole affair, it 
was found afterwards by those who gave it the most minute and thorough inves- 
tigation, there was no ground for the proposed action, which appeared, in the 
light of all the facts, as an effort to make Mr. Patterson a scapegoat, his entire 
connection with the affair being fully explained by_his own statement, in accord- 
ance with the facts, thus showing the resolution to be one of the most cruel 
things ever attempted, as it has since been uniformly characterized by publie 
men best informed and of most critical judgment. He visited England twice 
and traveled on the Continent of Europe once. He was much called for as a 
political speaker, and as orator on great historical or memorial occasions, and 
was again clected by his townsmen as member of the State legislature, and in 
1885 was appointed superintendent of the schools of New Hampshire, and so 
remained until a few months before his death, when he was elected to a special 
professorship in Dartmouth College. Noman ever made a greater impression 
on the schools of the State. As he went about lecturing and visiting schools he 
was called a traveling university. As a teacher, he was a great favorite with his 
students, and was one of the early teachers to whose awakening power Dr. W. 
T. Harris was fond of acknowledging his indebtedness. He died suddenly, sit- 
ting in his chair, in the weekly prayer meeting. 
PaTTEN, Prof. Ors, died at Albuquerque, N. Mex., in his seventy-third year; begin-

  Preface 
In the early winter of 1896 ‘the committee mak- 
ing the following report was appointed by the 
American Historical Association to consider the 
subject of history in the secondary schools and 
to draw up a scheme of college entrance require- 
ments in history. Since that time we have held 
five meetings, each lasting several days; at each 
of these meetings all the members of the com- 
mittee have been present, except that Professor 
Salmon was absent in Europe during the last two. 
Every question involving doubt has been carefully, 
thoroughly, and systematically discussed, and in 
the conclusions here presented all the members 
concur. 
Of the seven persons composing the commit- 
tee only one is a teacher in a secondary school; 
three others, however, have been secondary-school 
teachers, while others have been actively interested 
for years in the general problems under considera-

tion. Although we felt that we had at the beginning 
some knowledge of the situation, and knew of the 
difficulties and limitations as well as of the accom- 
plishments of the schools, it seemed necessary to 
make a careful study of the whole question and to 
gather information concerning the conditions and 
the tendencies of historical instruction. We have 
endeavored, in the light of the actual facts, to pre- 
pare a report that may be useful and suggestive 
to teachers of history and that may furnish to 4 
superintendents and principals some assistance in 
the task of framing programmes and in determin- 
ing methods of work. We have sought to be 
helpful rather than merely critical or depreciatory, 
and have tried to consider the whole field in a 
broad and general way, remembering that we were 
making suggestions and recommendations, not for 
the schools of one section or of one kind, but for 
the schools of the nation.

Preliminary Work of the 
Committee 
History as a secondary study now demands seri- 
ous attention. The report of the National Com- 
missioner of Education for 1896-97 shows that 
there were at that time 186,581 pupils in the sec- 
ondary schools studying history (other than United 
States history}. No statistics have been collected 
to show the number studying the history and gov- 
ernment of the United States; but there is good 
ground for saying that, if such students were taken 
into account, the number of history pupils would 
be found to exceed two hundred thousand, and 
would perhaps equal if not exceed in number 
those engaged in the study of any other subject 
save algebra. According to the statistics of the 
Bureau of Education, the number of pupils study- 
ing history (other than United States history) has 
increased one hundred and fifty-two per cent in the 
last ten years,.a rate of increase below that of only 
one subject in the curriculum. These simple facts 
B I
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 Preliminary Work 
seem to make it plain that college entrance re 
quirements, that are properly based upon the work 
and tendencies of the secondary schools, should 
include a liberal amount of history among the 
prescribed and optional studies. 
An investigation of the subject of history, as it 
is studied and taught in the secondary schools, 
presents many difficulties. Even before the com- 
mittee began seriously to consider what work was 
to be done, it became apparent that only a thorough 
study would be profitable, that general conclusions 
or recommendations, even on such a question as 
that of college entrance requirements, could not 
be made without an examination of the whole field 
and a consideration of many fundamental princi- 
ples, or without ascertaining what was now doing 
in the high schools and academies of the country. 
Before this work was undertaken, there had not 
been any systematic attempt of this kind; nor had 
there been any prolonged effort by any national 
association to present the claims of history, or to 
set before the schoolmen a statement of what might 
be considered the value of historical study and 
the place which it should occupy in the school 
programme. We do not leave out of consideration 
the work of the Committee of Ten, nor do we 
underestimate the value or the effect of the able 
and highly interesting report of the Madison Con-  
-P-A-G-E-13
Previous Discussions 3 
ference on History, Civil Government, and Eco- 
nomics ;! and we do not lose sight of the fact that 
historical instruction in the secondary schools had 
often been discussed in pedagogical conferences 
and teachers’ associations. Before we began our 
work, it was plain that there was an awakening 
interest in this whole subject, and the time seemed 
to be at hand when a systematic effort would meet 
with response and produce results. But in spite 
of all that had been done, and in spite of this 
awakened interest, there was no recognized con- 
sensus of opinion in the country at large, not one 
generally accepted judgment, not even one well- 
known point of agreement, which would serve as 
a beginning for a consideration of the place of 
history in the high-school curriculum. Such a 
statement cannot be made concerning any other 
subject commonly taught in the secondary schools. 
The task of the committee was, therefore, to 
discover the actual situation, to see what was doing 
and what was the prevailing sentiment, to localize 
and establish a modicum of practices and prin- 
ciples, however small and limited it might be; and, 
having apprehended what was best and most help-

Bureau of Education in 1893, and reprinted by the American Book 
Company, New York, 1894.

ful in spirit and tendency among teachers of the 
country, to seek to give that spirit expression in a 
report that would be helpful and suggestive, and 
that would be of service in widening the field of 
agreement and in laying the foundations for a 
common understanding. 
In all of our work we have endeavored not only 
to discover any agreement or common understand- 
ing that may exist among American teachers, but 
to keep in mind the fact that local conditions and 
environments vary exceedingly,— that what may 
be expected of a large and well-equipped school 
need not be expected of a small one, and that 
large preparatory schools and academies, some of 
them intentionally fitting boys for one or two uni- 
versities, are in a situation quite unlike that in 
which the great majority of high schools are com- 
pelled to work. We have sought chiefly to 
discuss, in an argumentative way, the general sub- 
ject submitted for consideration, to offer sugges- 
tions as to methods of historical teaching and ‘as 
to the place of history on the school programme, 
being fully aware that, when all is said and done, 
only so much will be adopted as appeals to the 
sense and judgment of the secondary teachers and 
superintendents; and that any rigid list of require- 
ments, or any body of peremptory demands, how- 
ever judiciously framed, not only would, but should, 
 
-P-A-G-E-15
  Present Conditions 5 
be disregarded in schools whose local conditions 
make it unwise to accept them. 
The committee determined that every reason- 
able means should be used to ascertain the present 
condition of historical study. Several hundred 
circulars asking for information were sent out to 
schools in all parts of the United States, selected 
not because they were supposed to be exception- 
ally good or exceptionally bad, or unusually strong 
in historical work, but because they were recom- 
mended to the committee by competent authority 
as typical schools. Circulars were sent to different 
kinds of schools, to those in small towns as well as 
to those in large cities, and to private academies 
as well as to public high schools. About two hun- 
dred and fifty replies have been received, and the 
information thus gathered is presented and dis- 
cussed in Appendix I. to this report. 
But to seek information through printed inter- 
rogatories is always somewhat unsatisfactory; and 
the committee therefore used other means also. 
Steps were taken to secure full discussions in the 
different educational associations of the country, 
in order that many teachers might become inter- 
ested in the work of the committee and give need- 
ful information, and in order that there might be a 
free interchange of opinion on some of the more 
important problems that called for solution. Dis- 
   
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 Preliminary Work 
cussions on some portions of our report have been 
held by the New England History Teachers’ As- 
sociation, the Association of Colleges and Prepara- 
tory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, 
the Michigan Schoolmasters’ Club, the Round 
Table in History of the National Educational As- 
sociation, and by other educational bodies, as well 
as at two meetings of the American Historical 
Association. Moreover, at various times in the 
course of the past two years, different members of 
the committee have personally consulted teachers 
and talked the subject over with them. These 
efforts seem to demonstrate that we have not 
reached conclusions hastily, and that our report is 
not merely the expression of the theoretical aspira- 
tions of college professors who are unacquainted 
with the conditions of the secondary schools. It 
is in a very proper sense the result of careful ex- 
amination and systematic inquiry concerning the 
secondary conditions of the country. 
It is not necessary to review here in detail the 
conclusions reached from a study of the circulars 
received from the schools. It will be seen by an 
examination of these conclusions, as presented in 
the Appendix, that in regard to many matters on 
which we sought information there is little or no 
agreement. Concerning the amount of history 
offered, the fields of history studied, the order
-P-A-G-E-17
Information from Teachers a 
in which the different fields are taken up, and the 
years in which the subject is taught, there is much 
diversity of practice; but, on the other hand, we 
find marked approach to uniformity in one par- 
ticular; namely, that good schools in all parts of 
the United States have adopted substantially simi- 
lar methods~of-instruction:? It is perfectly plain 
that the old rote system is going by the board. 
Practically every school now reports the use of ma- 
terial outside the text-book, and recognizes that a 
library is necessary for efficient work; and nearly 
all teachers assign topics for investigation by the 
pupil, or give written recitations, or adopt like 
means of arousing the pupil’s interest and of lead- 
ing him to think and work in some measure inde- 
pendently, in order that he may acquire power as 
well as information.1 Of course these methods 
are more extensively developed in some schools 
than in others; but the facts point to a common 
understanding, or at least to the approach toward 
a common understanding, of what history teaching 
should be, and to a growing appreciation of what 
historical study can do. We venture to say that 
if a school has well-trained teachers, who know 
why they teach and how to teach, the order of 
1 Undoubtedly the report of the Madison Conference had a very 
beneficial influence in this direction, by calling the attention of the 
teachers of the country to what ideals of historical instruction are. 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  8 Preliminary Work 
historical studies, or the exact method of handling 
a field of historical inquiry, is comparatively unim- 
portant; and it is this evidence of a realization 
that history has a value as a pedagogical subject, 
indicating as it does a new interest on the part of 
teachers and directors of schools, and bringing 
surely in its train a demand for skilful teachers, 
which should give courage and hope to those who 
are interested in the successful use of history as a 
means of discipline and culture. 
In matters of detail, the conclusions that could 
be drawn from the replies to the circulars were 
somewhat meagre, but they were helpful in ena- 
bling the committee to judge of tendencies and to 
form a general opinion as to existing conditions. 
But, as we have already said, we have not con- 
tented ourselves with this method of ascertaining 
the situation. By the more personal means adopted 
we have gained information which cannot readily 
be tabulated, but which enables us to have some 
assurance concerning the tendencies of the time, 
and to feel that in many respects present condi- 
tions are not satisfactory to the active, progressive 
teachers of the country. It is often more valu- 
able to find out how one highly successful teacher 
attains his end than how twenty unsuccessful 
teachers do not; and to discover what practical, 
experienced teachers, who have given thought to
-P-A-G-E-19
    
Results from Circulars 9 
the subject, think can be done and should be done, 
than to know the static condition of twenty others 
who are content with the semi-success or the fail- 
ure of the present. 
In the summer of 1897 three members of the com- 
mittee were studying educational problems in Eu- 
rope. Miss Salmon spent the summer in Germany 
and German Switzerland, studying the methods 
of historical instruction in the secondary schools. 
The results of her investigations were given in a 
paper read before the American Historical Asso- 
ciation in December, 1897. Mr. Haskins has at 
different times studied the educational system of 
France; after a further examination of secondary 
conditions in 1897, he prepared a report on the 
subject of history teaching in that country. Mr. 
Fox has a thorough acquaintance with the English 
public schools, and has prepared a report on the 
teaching of history in the secondary schools of 
England. These articles on the conditions of 
historical instruction in European countries are 
given as Appendices to this report. They are not 
offered as furnishing us models to which we ought 
to conform, but as investigations in the study of 
comparative education; they may, however, give 
to teachers of this country suggestions on the 
subject of general pedagogical values, methods — 
of historical instruction, and the arrangement of
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 Preliminary Work 
studies. The committee has not supposed that it 
is possible to import a foreign-made régime to which 
the American schools can be asked to adapt them- 
selves. 
It will be seen that of foreign countries Germany 
is the one that offers to America the most lessons, 
of which probably the most important is that sug- 
gested by the great advantage resulting from hav- 
ing the subject of history, as well as other subjects, 
in the hands of thoroughly equipped teachers, who 
have received instruction in method, and are versed 
in the art of imparting information with due regard 
to the pupil’s age and degree of mental advance- 
ment. In the German gymmnasia the course of 
history, from Homeric times to the present day, 
is covered with great thoroughness and system. 
To this part of the report on the German schools 
we wish to call special attention; for while we do 
not think that it is profitable for us, even in this 
particular, to follow the German curriculum exactly, 
we believe that there should be an effort on the 
part of those who are organizing programmes to 
reach toward this ideal, by extending the course 
of history over a number of years, and by devel- 
oping it in accordance with the psychological 
principles which have been adhered to in the prep- 
aration of the German course of study. It should 
be noticed too that in German schools, history is
-P-A-G-E-21
  German Experience Il 
correlated with other subjects: the teacher of his- 
tory, where opportunity offers, makes use of the 
foreign language which the pupils are studying, 
and the language teacher refers to historical facts ; 
one subject in the curriculum thus helps to re- 
enforce another. The methods of the German 
teacher also deserve careful consideration : inter- 
est is aroused by skilful oral teaching, in which 
the teacher adapts his story to the minds and 
capacities of his hearers, and so holds their atten- 
tion that concentration of mind and ability to grasp 
the subject are developed. It must be confessed 
that Miss Salmon’s description of how a teacher 
in Bale, in the middle of a hot summer day, held 
the breathless attention of a class of boys for 
fifty minutes, while he told the story of the dra- 
matic struggle between Henry IV. and Gregory 
VII., suggests not only phenomenal methods, but 
unusual boys; but withal we must attribute the 
teacher’s success to his skill, and to the previous 
training which the boys had received in the lower 
grades, where inattention or heedlessness was not 
tolerated. 
Doubtless teachers of history in this country can- 
not follow the example of German teachers in all 
respects. The German believes that, until the boy 
reaches the university, he has no judgment to be 
appealed to, and no great reasoning faculty to be  
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 Preliminary Work 
developed ; that it is his business, until eighteen or 
nineteen years of age, to absorb, not to argue or 
discuss. He is not expected to ask questions; he 
is expected to do what he is told. Such, however, 
is not the system for making American citizens, 
and such is not the atmosphere in which the Amer- 
ican boy or girl should live. Nor can it be said 
that under our present conditions the teacher of 
history should attempt to give instruction to sec- 
ondary pupils without the help of a text. 
The system and methods of instruction in the 
schools of France are interesting, but somewhat 
less suggestive than those of the German schools. 
There, as in Germany, history is in the hands of 
trained teachers, who have a capacity for holding 
the pupil’s attention, arousing interest, and devel- 
oping a love for historical study, as well as for giv- 
ing a vast amount of historical information. The 
course of study is long, thorough, and systemati- 
cally organized. The conditions of German Switz- 
erland are essentially similar to those of Germany 
itself. 
The situation in England does not offer many 
valuable lessons to American teachers. The most 
noticeable features are a lack of historicalinstruc- 
tion, a common failure to recognize the value of 
history, and a certain incoherence and general con- 
fusion. We cannot here discuss the reasons for
-P-A-G-E-23
  France and England 13 
these conditions. It is enough to say that the /ais- 
sez faire idea has been carried farther and is more 
marked in England than in America; for, on the 
whole, we have an educational system, and each 
passing year shows an increase in the common 
stock of principles. And yet one who examines 
the condition of historical instruction in this coun: 
try, and compares it with that of France and 
Germany, feels that Englishmen and Americans 
are of one blood: the individualistic spirit of the 
race has found unusual expression in educational 
practices, and has made against codperation and 
harmony, while instinctive aversion to theoretical 
arrangement has hindered the development of gen- 
eral principles. A comparison of English con- 
ditions with those of the continent will be likely 
to show the value of system and order, and the 
advantage resulting from the sway of good peda- 
gogical doctrines. We must endeavor in America 
to reach a system of our own, and to recognize the 
force of sound principles, without losing sight of 
the fact that our local conditions are many, and 
that we must rely on individual initiative and en- 
thusiasm, if not on impulse. Nevertheless, in spite 
of local diversity, and in spite of the fact that a 
rigid 7égime seems on the whole impossible if not 
undesirable, in this country, there are sound gen- 
eral principles that may be termed absolute rather
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 Preliminary Work 
than relative; there is a proper method of unfold. 
ing the subject, and there are improper methods ; 
or, to speak more justly, method and system, 
which recognize the true character of the study 
and the principles by which it may be adapted to 
pupils of different ages, are certainly wiser and 
better than any haphazard method and lack of 
system can be. 
While it is impossible to transplant any foreign 
course of study to our schools, and unwise to imi- 
tate blindly European methods of instruction, there 
are at least two lessons that may be learned from 
foreign schools; namely, the wisdom of demanding 
thoroughly trained teachers of history, and that of 
giving a large place to historical instruction in all 
courses. In both France and Germany, history is 
taught by special teachers, whose historical training 
has been carried to a point well beyond our Ameri- 
can bachelor’s degree, and whose pedagogical abil- 
ity has been specially tested. In France an hour 
and a half each week is given to history throughout 
the ten years of the elementary school and Jycée; 
in Germany, history is pursued two or three hours 
weekly in every year of the nine years of the gym- 
nasium ; and even in Russia the time given to his- 
tory is much longer than in the average American 
school. Not merely on these grounds, however, 
do we ask larger recognition for history; we hope 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  Lessons from Abroad 15 
to present, in the course of this report, substantial 
reasons for such recognition drawn from the nature 
of the subject and from its relations to the devel- 
opment of the American boys and girls; but we 
call attention to what is now done in other coun- 
tries as evidence that our recommendations are not 
fanciful or revolutionary. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  Value of Historical Study 
Ir may seem to be unnecessary to consider the 
value of historical study in itself, or to show how 
history may be related to other subjects in the 
school curriculum. Asa matter of fact, however, 
the educational value of every other subject has 
received more attention than that of history; in- 
deed, only within the last few years has there 
been anything like a thoughtful discussion, by 
practical teachers, of the worth of history as a dis- 
ciplinary study. When so much has been said of 
the necessity of studying the natural sciences, in 
order that one may come to some realization of the 
physical and vital world about him, and may know 
himself better as he knows his surroundings more 
thoroughly, and in order that his powers of obser- 
vation may be quickened and strengthened, it 
seems strange indeed that the same method of 
argument has not been used in behalf of historical 
work. If it is desirable that the high-school pupil 
should know the physical world, that he should 
know the habits of ants and bees, the laws of floral 
16

growth, the simple reactions in the chemical retort, 
it is certainly even more desirable t 
2 be led to see the steps in the development_of the 
man race, and should have some dim perception _ 
“of his own n place, and of his country’s 
_great movements of men. One does not need to 
say in these latter days that secondary education 
ought to fit boys and girls to become, not scholas- 
tics, but men and women who know their surround- 
ings and have come to a sympathetic knowledge 
of their environment; and it does not seem neces- 
sary now to argue that the most essential result 
of secondary education is acquaintance with politi- 
cal and social environment, some appreciation of 
the nature of the state and society, some sense of 
the duties and responsibilities of citizenship, some 
capacity in dealing with political and governmental 
questions, something of the broad and tolerant 
spirit which is bred by the study of past times and 
conditions. 
It is a law well recognized by psychologists, a 
law of which the teacher in school or college sees 
daily application and illustration, that one obtains 
knowledge by adding to the ideas which one 
already has new ideas organically related to the 
old. Recent psychological pedagogy looks upon 
the child as a reacting organism, and declares that 
he should be trained in those reactions which he

will most need as an adult. The chief object of. 
ep oeseienceel. teacher is to get pupils: to think. properly after the method adopted in his particular 
Tine of work; not an accumulation of information, 
but the habit of correct thinking, is the supreme re- 
sult of good teaching in every branch of instruction. 
“AIthis simaply means that the suadsnt WHo is fought to consider political subjects in school, who is led

We do not think that this preparation is satis- 
factorily acquired merely through the study of 
civil government, which, strictly construed, has to 
do only with existing institutions. The pupil 
should see the growth of the institutions which 
surround him; he should see the work of men; he 
should study the living concrete facts of the past; 
he should know of nations that have risen and 
fallen; he should see tyranny, vulgarity, greed, 
benevolence, patriotism, self-sacrifice, brought out 
in the lives and works of men. So strongly

themselves with a description of the government

as it is, but describe at considerable length the 
origin and development of the institutions of which 
they speak. While we have no desire to under- 
estimate the value of civil government as a sec- f 
ondary study, especially if it is written and taught s 
from the historical point of view, we desire to 
emphasize the thought that appreciation and sym-_ 
athy for the present is 
the past; and while we believe that it is the imper-_ 
ative duty of every hi academy to 
_te “teach boys and girls the elementary knowledge of 
the political machinery which they will be called_ 
upon to manage as citizens of a free state, we 
insist_also_that_they should have the broader 
knowledge, the more intelligent spirit, that at_comes _ 
from a study of other men and of other times. _ 
see that society is in move- 
ment, that what one sees about him is not the 
—eternal bit the transient, and that in the processes 
“of change virtue must be militant Wit is to be triumph 
While it is doubtless true that too much may be 
made of the idea that history furnishes us with 
rules, precepts, and maxims which may be used as 
immutable principles, as unerring guides for the 
conduct of the statesman and the practical poli- 
tician, or as means of foretelling the future, it is 
equally true that progress comes by making addi-  
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 Value of History 
tions to the past or by its silent modification. 
All our institutions, our habits of thought and 
modes of action, are inheritances from preceding 
ages: no conscious advance, no worthy reform, 
can be secured without both a knowledge of the 
present and an appreciation of how forces have 
worked in the social and political organization of 
former times. If this be so, need we seriously 
argue that the boys and girls in the schoolroom 
should be introduced to the past, which has created 
the present,—that historical-mindedness should 
be in some slight measure bred within them, and 
that they should be given the habit, or the begin- 
nings of a habit, of considering what has been, 
when they discuss what is or what should be? 
Believing, then, that one of the chief objects of 
study is to bring boys and girls to some knowledge 
of their environment and to fit them to become 
intelligent citizens, we need hardly say that, if the 
study of history helps to accomplish this object, the 
public schools of the country are under the heavi- 
est obligations to foster the study, and not to treat 
it as an intruder entitled only to a berth in a cold 
corner, after language, mathematics, science, music, 
drawing, and gymnastics have been comfortably 
provided for. “It is clear,’ as Thomas Arnold 
has said, “that in whatever it is our duty to act, 
those matters also it is our duty to study.” It is
-P-A-G-E-31
  
  Training in Citizenship 21 
true that any subject which aids the pupil to think 
correctly, to be accurate and painstaking, which 
awakens his interest in books and gives him 
resources within himself, in reality fits him for 
good and useful citizenship ; but what other sub- 
jects do in this direction more or less indirectly, 
history does directly; and moreover, if properly 
taught, it is not inferior to other subjects as a dis- 
ciplinary and educational study. Fortunately, an 
examination of school programmes, educational 
periodicals, and like material will now convince 
any one that educators’ are coming to the conclu- 
sion that history must receive more attention, and 
must be taught wisely and well. 
Histor i he judgment by leading the 
pupil to see the relati cause and effect, 
as cause and effect appear in human affairs. We 
do not mean by this that his attention should be 
directed solely to great moving causes, or that he 
should study what is sornetimes called the “ phi- 
losophy of history,”—far from it; nor do we 
mean that time should be consumed in discussing 
the meaning of facts when the facts themselves 
are not known. But history has to do with the 
becoming of past events, —not simply with what 
was, but with what came to be, —and in studying 
the simplest forms of historical narrative even the 
average pupil comes to see that one thing leads to 
   
-P-A-G-E-32
    22 Value of History | 
another; he begins quite unconsciously to see that 
events do not simply succeed each other in time, 
but that one grows out of another, or rather out of 
a combination of many others. Thus, before the 
end of the secondary course, the well-trained pupil 
has acquired some power in seeing relationships 
and detecting analogies. While it is perfectly true 
that the generalizing faculty is developed late, and 
that the secondary pupil will often learn unrelated 
data with ease, if not with avidity, it is equally true 
that history in the hands of the competent teacher 
is a great instrument for developing in the pupil 
capacity for seeing underlying reasons and for 
comprehending motives. In the ordinary class- 
room work, both in science and in mathematics, 
there is little opportunity for discussion, for differ- 
ences of opinion, for balancing of probabilities ; 
and yet in everyday life we do not deal with math- 
ematical demonstrations, or concern ourselves with 
scientific observations ; we reach conclusions by a 
judicious consideration of circumstances and con- 
ditions, some of them in apparent conflict with one 
another, and none of them susceptible of exact 
feasurement and determination. 
The study of history gives training not only in 
acquiring facts, but in arranging and systematiz- 
ing them and in putting forth individual product. — 
Power of gathering information is important, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-33

this power the study of history cultivates; but the 
power of using information is of greater importance, 
_and this power t too is devel oped by historical A 
“We do not ask that pupils should be required to 
do so-called “laboratory work,” —we abjure the 
phrase, — and create histories out of absolutely un- 
hewn and unframed material; we simply say that, 
if a pupil is taught to get ideas and facts from vari- 
ous books, and to put those facts together into a 
new form, his ability to make use of knowledge is 
increased and strengthened. By assigning well- 
chosen topics that are adapted to the capacity of 
the pupil, and by requiring him to gather his in- 
formation in various places, the teacher may train 
the pupil to collect historical material, to arrange 
it, and to put it forth. This practice, we repeat, 
develops capacity for effective work, not capacity 
for absorption alone.?

‘History is also helpful in developing what is -— 
sometimes called the scientific habit of mind and 
thought. In one sense, this may mean th 
of thorough investigation for one’s self of all 
sources of information, before one reaches con- _ a

the learned specialist can thus test more than the

most ordinary and commonplace truths or princi- 
ples in any field of work. The scientific habit of 
mind in a broader sense means a recognition of 
the fact that sound conclusions do rest on some- 
body’s patient investigations; that, although we 
must accept the work of others, everybody is re- 
quired to study and think and examine before he 
positively asserts; that every question should be 
approached without prejudice; that open-minded- 
ness, candor, honesty, are requisites for the attain- 
ment of scientific knowledge. The thoughtful 
teacher of experience will probably say that, even 
in the earlier years of the secondary course, these 
prime requisites of wholesome education may in 
some measure be cultivated; and that, when op- 
portunity for comparative work is given in the 
later years, historical-mindedness may be so de- 
veloped as materially to influence the character 
and habits of the pupil. : 
While we believe that power and not informa- 
tion must be the chief end of all school work, we 
must not underestimate the value of a store of 
historical material. By the study of history the 
pupil acquires a knowledge of facts that is to him 
a source of pleasure and gratification in his after 
life. If there be any truth in the saying that 
» culture consists of an acquaintance with the best 
which the past has produced, —a very insufficient  
-P-A-G-E-35
  Training in Character 25 
definition, to be sure, — we need not argue about 
the value of historical information. But we may 
emphasize that brighter and broader culture which 
springs from a sympathy: with the onward move- 
ments of the past, and an intelligent compre- 
hension of the duties of the present. Many a 
teacher has found that, in dealing with the great 
and noble acts and struggles of bygone men, he 
has succeeded in reaching the inner nature of the 
real boys and girls of his classes, and has given 
them impulses and honorable prejudices that are 
the surest sources of permanent and worthy refine- 
ment. We may venture to suggest that character 
is of ever greater value than culture. 
A no less import result_of historical study 4 
is the training which pupils receive in the handling 
of books. History, more than any other subject 
in the secondary curriculum, demands for effec-_ 
tive work a library and the ability to use it. Skill 
or in thumbing indexes and fingering tables of con- 
tents, is of great value to any one who is called 
upon to use books. The inability to discover what 
a book contains or where information is to be 
found is one of the common failings of the un- 
schooled and the untrained man. Through the 
study of history this facility in handling material 
may be cultivated, and at the same time the pupil
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 Value of History 
may be introduced to good literature and inspired 
with a love for reading which will prove a priceless 
treasure to him. In this latter respect the study 
of history is second to that of English literature 
alone. 
With these results of historical study two others 
of decided value may in conclusion be briefly men- 
tioned :_by the reading of good book books, and by con-_ 
stant efforts to re-create the real _past_and make 
it live | again, the pupil’s imagination is at once _ 
quickened, strengthened, and disciplined ; and b 2. 
means of the ordinary oral recitation, if prope rly 
“conducted, he may be taught to express h himself in 
_well-chosen_} words. | In the study of foreign lan-— 
guage, he learns words and sees distinctions in 
their meanings; in the study of science, he learns 
to speak with technical exactness and care ; in the 
study of history, while he must speak truthfully 
and accurately, he must seek to find apt words of 
his own with which to describe past conditions and 
to clothe his ideas, in a broad field of work which 
has no technical method of expression and no 
peculiar phraseology.

Continuity of Historical Study 
and the Relation of History to 
other Subjects 
WE have no intention of framing a secondary- 
school course, in which each study shall be care- 
fully related in time and space with every other; 
such a process is, for the present at least, a task 
for each superintendent or principal in the conduct 
of his own work. Certain suggestions, however, 
are pertinent, and may be helpful. 
e_believe that, whenever possible, history _ 
should be a continuous study. In some schools it 
is How given in three successive years; in others 
it is offered in each of the four years of at least 
one course. Some practical teachers, impressed 
with this need of continuity, and feeling unable to 
give more time to the work, have thought it wise 
to give the subject in periods of only two recita- 
tions per week for one year or more; and such a 
plan may prove desirable for the purpose of con- 
necting two years in which the work is given four 
or five times per week, or for the purpose of 
27;
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 Relations of History 
extending the course. Probably two periods a 
week, however, will seem altogether impracticable 
to the great majority of teachers, and we do not 
recommend that this step be taken when the cir- 
cumstances allow more substantial work. A prac- 
tical working programme in one of the very best 
western schools presents the following course :— 
7th grade, American History . . . . . 4 periods. 
8th grade, American History . . 2 periods. 
gth grade (1st year of high school), Gees 
and Roman History . . . . . . 3 periods. 
toth grade, English History. . . . . . 3 periods. 
11th grade, Institutional History . . . . 2 periods. 
12th grade, American History . . . . . 2 periods. 
Another school of high grade, where effective 
work is done, gives history in three periods per 
week for two years, and in five periods per week 
for two more years, viz. : — 
Ist year of high school, Oriental, Greek, 
and Roman History . . . 3 times.

Continuity 20 
quired. These courses are given here simply to 
show how a long, continuous course may be 
arranged, where the circumstances make it inad- 
visable to give work four or five times per week 
for four years. We do not recommend courses in 
which the study comes twice a week, but only say 
that in some instances they may prove advisable 
as a means of keeping the parts of the course in 
connection. We cannot see our way clear to pro- 
posing the acceptance of a two-hour course in his- 
tory for entrance to college, if units are counted 
or definite requirements are laid down. 
A secondary-school course in which there are 
many distinct subjects may furnish to the pupil 
only bits of information, and not give the discipline 
resulting from a prolonged and continuous appli- 
cation to one subject, which is gradually unfolded 
as the pupil’s mind and powers are developed. A 
course without unity may be distracting, and not 
educating in the original and best sense of the 
word. At least in some courses of the high school 
or academy, history is the best subject to give 
unity, continuity, and strength. Where a foreign 
language is pursued for four consecutive years, it 
serves this purpose; but in other cases it is doubt- 
ful whether anything can do the work so well as 
history. Even science has so many branches and 
distinct divisions, — at all events, as it is customarily 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 Relations of History 
taught, —that it does not seem to be a continuous 
subject. Doubtless there are relationships between 
physiology, chemistry, physics, botany, and physi- 
cal geography, and of course the methods of work 
in all of them are similar; but to treat science as 
one subject, so that it may give opportunity for 
continuous development of the pupil, and for a 
gradual unfolding of the problems of a single field 
of human study, seems to us to present many al- 
most insurmountable difficulties. A committee of 
historical students may be pardoned therefore for 
thinking that history furnishes a better instrument 
than science for such purposes. The history of the 
human race is one subject; and a course of four 
years can be so arranged as to make the study a 
continually developing and enlarging one, as the 
needs and capacities of the pupil are developed 
and enlarged. 
History should not be set at one side, as if it 
had no relation with other subjects in the sec- 
ondary course. Ideal conditions will prevail when 
the teachers in one field of work are able to take 
wise advantage of what their pupils are doing in 
another; when the teacher of Latin or Greek will 
call the attention of his pupils, as they read Czesar 
or Xenophon, to the facts which they have learned 
in their history classes; when the teachers of 
French and German and English will do the same;
-P-A-G-E-41
  
  Unity 31 
when the teacher of physical geography will re- 
member that the earth is man’s dwelling-place, 
or more properly his growing-place, and will be 
able to relate the mountains, seas, and tides of 
which he speaks with the growth and progress 
of men; when he will remember that Marco Polo 
and Henry the Navigator and Meriwether Lewis 
were unfolding geography and making history, and 
that Cape Verde not only juts out into the Atlantic, 
but stands forth as a promontory in human his- 
tory. Is the time far distant when the march of 
the Ten Thousand will be looked upon not merely 
as a procession of optative moods and conditional 
clauses, but as an account of the great victory won 
by Greek skill, discipline, and intelligence over 
the helplessness of Oriental confusion? And will 
Cesar long be taught only as a compound of 
ablative absolutes and indirect discourses, rather 
than as a story, told by one of history’s greatest 
men, of how our Teutonic forefathers were brought 
face to face with Roman power, and how the peo- 
ples of Gaul were subjected to the art and the 
arms of Rome, and made to pass under the yoke 
of bondage to southern civilization and southern 
law? The teacher of history, if he knows the 
foreign languages which his pupils are studying, 
may connect the words they have learned with 
concrete things; and he may, above all, help to
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 Relations of History 
give the young people who are trying to master a 
foreign tongue, some appreciation of the tone, 
temper, and spirit of the people, without which a 
language seems void and characterless. 
History has a central position among the sub- 
jects of the curriculum. Like literature, it deals 
with man, and appeals to the sympathy, the imag- 
ination, and the emotional nature of the pupils. 
Like natural science, it employs methods of care- 
ful and unprejudiced investigation. It belongs to 
the humanities, for its essential purpose is to dis- 
close human life; but it also searches for data, 
groups them, and builds generalizations from them. 
Though it may not be a science itself, its methods 
are similar to scientific methods, and are valuable 
in inculcating in the pupil a regard for accuracy 
and a reverence for truth. It corrects the formal- 
istic bias of language, by bringing the pupil into 
sympathetic contact with actualities and with the 
mind of man as it has reacted on his environment. 
It gives breadth, outlook, and human interest, 
which are not easily developed by the study of 
natural phenomena. Thus, as a theoretical propo- 
sition, at least, the assertion that the story of life 
and the onward movement of men, not their lan- 
guage or their physical environment, should form 
the centre of a liberal course, would seem to leave 
little ground for argument.
-P-A-G-E-43
A Central Subject 34 
We may add to all these considerations the fact 
that even in the natural sciences, as well as in other 
subjects, the historical method is not seldom used 
by advanced scholars and thinkers. The scholarly 
scientific investigator knows from careful study the 
development of his subject; he sees the successes 
and the failures of the past, and recognizes the 
lasting contributions that have from time to time 
been made in his field of investigation; he often 
studies the civilization that gave birth to bygone 
and obsolete theories, and comes thus to a knowl- 
edge of his department of work as a growing and 
developing department. So, too, the advanced lin- 
guistic scholar is frequently engaged, not so much 
in the study of language, as in the examination of 
successive intellectual movements which have found 
expression in literature. This practice of linking 
the present with the past, of watching progress and 
studying change, has become one of the marked 
characteristics of modern learning; and it indi- 
cates that history, in the broad field of human 
affairs, is a subject which is contributory to others, 
is indeed a part of them, and occupies a central 
position among them.

Four Years’ Course, consisting of 
Four Blocks or Periods 
As a thorough and systematic course of study, 
we recommend four years of work, beginning with 
ancient history and ending with American history. 
For these four years we propose the division of 
the general field into four blocks or periods, and 
recommend that they be studied in the order in 
which they are here set down, which in large 
measure accords with the natural order of events, 
and shows the sequence of historical facts : — 
(1) Ancient History, with special reference to 
Greek and Roman history, but including also a 
short introductory study of the more ancient na- 
tions. This period should also embrace the early 
Middle Ages, and should close with the establish- 
ment of the Holy Roman Empire (800), or with 
the death of Charlemagne (814), or with the treaty 
of Verdun (843). 
(2) Medizeval and Modern European History, 
from the close of the first period to the present 
time. 
34
-P-A-G-E-45
  The Four Fields 35 
(3) English History. 
(4) American History and Civil Government. 
No one of these fields can be omitted without 
leaving serious /acune in the pupil’s knowledge of 
history. Each department has its special value 
and teaches its special lesson ; above all, the study 
of the whole field gives a meaning to each portion 
that it cannot have by itself. Greek and Roman 
civilization contributed so much to the world,— 
the work which these nations accomplished, the 
thoughts which they brought forth, the ideas 
which they embodied, form so large a part of the 
past, —that in any systematic course their history 
must be studied. The student of modern politics 
cannot afford to be ignorant of the problems, the 
strivings, the failures, of the republics and democ- 
racies of the ancient world. We speak of these 
nations as belonging to antiquity, but we have much 
of them with us to-day. The law of Rome has not 
gone; the highest thought of Greece is eternal. 
We might justly insist that medizeval history is 
worthy of a place in the school programme for its 
own sake, recounting as it does the development 
of the papacy and the Church, the establishment 
of feudalism, the foundation of modern states, the 
Renaissance, and the beginning of the Reforma- 
tion. But, if for no other reason, the history of 
the Middle Ages deserves study because without
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 Four Years’ Course 
it Greece and Rome are isolated and seem to dwell 
in a world apart. On the other hand, the char- 
acter of the forces of modern times cannot be 
understood by one who examines them without 
reference to their medizeval origins. 
Nor will any one seriously maintain in these 
latter days, when men are studying world move- 
ments, — when, as we are told, America has become 
a world power, —that the intelligent citizen has no 
concern with the chief events and leading tenden- 
cies of the last four centuries of European history 
Indeed, it is especially desirable that American 
pupils should learn something of European history, 
since, by seeing the history of their own country 
in its proper perspective, they may appreciate its 
meaning, and may be relieved of a temptation to 
a narrow intolerance, which resembles patriotism 
only as bigotry resembles faith. 
Furthermore, English history until 1776 is our 
history ; Edward I. and Pym, Hampden and Will- 
iam Pitt, belong to our past and helped to make us 
what we are. Any argument in favor of Ameri- 
can history, therefore, holds almost equally true 
for the study of English history. A realization 
of present duties, a comprehension of present re- 
sponsibilities, an appreciation of present oppor- 
tunities, cannot better be inculcated than by a 
study of the centuries in which Englishmen were
-P-A-G-E-47
Chronological Sequence 37 
struggling for representation, free speech, and due 
process of law. 
The orderly chronological course which we here 
advocate has its marked advantages, but it should 
be so arranged that the pupil will do more than 
follow the main facts as he traces them from the 
earliest times to the present. The work must be 
so developed and widened, as time goes on, that 
in the later years the pupil will be dealing with 
broader and deeper problems than in the early 
years, and will be making use of the skill and 
scholarly sense that have been awakened and 
called into action by previous training. By a 
course of this sort, pupils will obtain a conspectus 
of history which is fairly complete and satisfac- 
tory, will follow the forward march of events, and 
will come to see the present as a product of the 
past; while the teacher, at the same time, will 
have opportunity to unfold the problems and diffi- 
culties of historical study. 
The desirability of arranging historical fields of 
work in their natural chronological order will prob- 
ably appeal to every one, and need not be dwelt 
upon. Some persons, however, may object to the 
arrangement as unwise, in the light of other con- 
siderations. It may be contended that pupils 
should pass “from the known to the unknown,” 
from the familiar to the unfamiliar and strange.   
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  38 Four Years’ Course 
This precept we do not care formally to accept or 
to reject; but it will be remembered, that in all 
primary and grammar schools some historical work 
is given, and that we can take for granted, proba- 
bly, that all pupils know something of Ameri- 
can history, and perhaps of other history in ad- 
dition. Asa matter of fact, therefore, we are not 
running counter to the doctrine above referred to, 
or violating the law of apperception. 
A like objection may be met with a similar 
answer. American history, some will say, should 
come the first year in the high school, because 
many pupils leave school before the later years. 
But this objection proves too much, for a large 
percentage of boys and girls do not enter the high 
school at all. American history should therefore 
be given in the grammar school. In fact, it is 
given in the eighth and lower grades in probably 
the vast majority of schools; to repeat the course 
therefore in the first year of the secondary course 
is almost a waste of time, inasmuch as any marked 
development in the method of treatment is im- 
possible. On the other hand, by putting the study 
late in the course, the pupil can work along new 
lines and attack new problems; the development 
of American institutions can be studied; new and 
more difficult books can be read, and more ad- 
vanced methods used.
-P-A-G-E-49
  Order of Fields 39 
Some teachers, believing that American history 
is essential in every course, will object to the cur- 
riculum here suggested, on the ground that the 
last year is already overcrowded, and that we are 
asking the impossible when we suggest that the 
study be placed in that year. In any argument 
on such a question, history is at a disadvantage, 
because other subjects have from time immemorial 
been considered first, while history has been treated 
as a poor and needy relative: other subjects have 
their places, and claim at once nine full points in 
law. If it is more important that pupils should 
have knowledge of chemistry, solid geometry, 
physics, Greek, English literature, Latin, and what 
not, than a knowledge of the essentials of the po- 
litical and social life about them, of the nature and 
origin of the federal Constitution, of their duties 
and rights as citizens, and of the fundamental 
ideas for which their country stands, then of 
course American history need not enter into the 
contest at all. In making these recommendations, 
however, we are not acting upon merely theoret- 
ical grounds: an investigation of existing condi- 
tions leads us to believe that there is a strong 
tendency to place American history in the last 
year of the course. 
It will be argued, again, that Greek and Roman 
history is too difficult for the first year. To this 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  40 Four Years’ Course 
we may answer, (1) that a number of excellent and 
successful teachers give the subject in the first 
year, and (2) that it is not necessary to fathom all 
the mysteries of the Athenian Constitution, or to 
penetrate the innermost secrets of Roman imperi- 
alism. It is not impossible to know the main out- 
lines of Greek and Roman history and to see the 
main features of Greek and Roman life. If Cesar, 
a great source of Roman history, can be studied in 
the original in the tenth grade, with all the sup- 
plementary information on military and historical 
matters which recent editors present, cannot sec- 
ondary material in the vernacular be studied in the 
ninth? While we do not think that Greek and 
Roman history should be treated as a handmaiden 
of the Latin and Greek languages (to treat the 
subjects thus is to invert the natural relationship), 
we suggest that a course in ancient history in the 
first year will serve to give life and meaning to all 
the work in the classic tongues: the idea may 
come home to the pupil that Ceesar and Cicero were 
real living, thinking, acting men, and not imagi- 
nary creatures begotten by the brains of modern 
grammar-mongers to vex the soul of the schoolboy. 
If this basis of fact is in the pupil’s mind, the clas-

a medium for bringing his pupils into contact with 
the thoughts and moving sentiments of antiquity. 
Some one may object that medizeval and modern 
European history is too difficult for the tenth 
grade, and that other subjects should come at that 
time. The answer to such objection is, of course, 
that any other subject is too difficult if taught 
in its height and depth and breadth, but that the 
cardinal facts of European history can be under- 
stood, interesting and intelligible books can be read, 
the significant lessons can be learned. How many 
boys, when they are sixteen years old, cannot 
understand “ The Scottish Chiefs,” “The Three 
Musketeers,” “Twenty Years After,” “Ivanhoe,” 
“The Talisman,” “With Fire and Sword”? And 
is the simple, truthful historic tale of border con- 
flict, the life and purposes of Richelieu, the death 
of Charles I., the career of Richard the Lion- 
hearted, the character of Saladin, the horrible 
barbarism of Tartar hordes, harder to be under- 
stood than the plot of an elaborate historical novel 
dealing with the same facts? Is truth necessarily 
more difficult, as well as stranger, than fiction? 
But the conclusive answer to this objection is the 
fact that European history in its most difficult 
form, “general history,” is now taught in the 
second year in the greater part of the schools 
which offer the subject.
-P-A-G-E-52
    42 Four Years’ Course 
The committee may be criticised for outlining a 
four years’ course at all, on the ground that no 
schools can devote so much time to history. This 
criticism is so important that the reasons which 
influenced us to take this action should be given 
seriatim. (1) Some schools do offer history in 
every year of the high school, either as a required 
or as an optional study; and the delineation of 
what seems to us a thorough and systematic régime 
may be of service to these schools, and to all 
others that desire to devote considerable time and 
energy to the subject. (2) If some schools can- 
not give all that is here proposed, that fact pre- 
sents no reason why an adequate course should 
not be outlined. We are not seeking to induce 
schools to give history a great amount of attention 
at the expense of other subjects; but a course 
altogether complete and adequate needs to be out- 
lined before one can rightly discuss the availability 
of anything else. (3) An approach to an ideal 
course, in order of subjects, method, treatment, 
and time, is better than one that is constructed 
without any reference to the best and most sym- 
metrical system. (4) As a general rule, definite 
parts of the plan which we here outline may be 
taken as a working scheme. It is not necessary 
to draw up, on an entirely new theory, a briefer 
curriculum for schools that cannot take the whole
-P-A-G-E-53
  
Question of Time 43 
of what we here recommend: the simplest and 
wisest plan under such circumstances is to omit 
one or more of the blocks or periods into which 
we have divided the general field. 
If only three years can be devoted to historical 
work, three of the periods outlined above may be 
chosen, and one omitted; such omission seems to 
us to be better than any condensation of the whole. 
But if any teacher desires to compress two of the 
periods into a single year’s work, one of the fol- 
lowing plans may be wisely adopted. (1) Combine 
English and American history in such a manner 
that the more important principles wrought out in 
English history, and the main facts of English 
expansion, will be taught in connection with 
American colonial and later political history. 
(2) Treat English history in such a way as to 
include the most important elements of medizeval 
and modern European history.
-P-A-G-E-54
  Why no Short Course in General 
History is Recommended 
From the foregoing remarks, it will be seen 
that the committee believes that history should be 
given in four consecutive years in the secondary 
school, and that the study should be developed in 
an orderly fashion, with reasonable regard for 
chronological sequence ; in other words, that four 
years should be devoted to the study of the world’s 
history, giving the pupil some knowledge of the 
progress of the race, enabling him to survey a 
broad field and to see the main acts in the histor- 
ical drama. While, of course, three years for such 
study are better than two, as two are better than 
one, a careful consideration of the problem in all 
its aspects has led us to the conclusion that we 
cannot strongly recommend, as altogether ade- 
quate, courses covering the whole field in less than 
four years. 
We do not recommend a short course in general 
history, because such a course necessitates one of 
two modes of treatment, neither of which is sound 
4 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  No Short Course 45 
and reasonable. By one method, energy is devoted 
to the dreary, and perhaps profitless, task of mem- 
orizing facts, dates, names of kings and queens, 
and the rise and fall of dynasties; there is no 
opportunity to see how facts arose or what they 
effected, or to study the material properly, or to see 
the events in simple form as one followed upon 
another, or to become acquainted with the histori- 
cal method of handling definite concrete facts 
and drawing inferences from them. The pupil is 
not introduced to the first principles of historical 
thinking; he is not brought into sympathy with 
men and ideas, or led to see the play of human 
forces, or given such a real knowledge of past times 
and conditions that he can realize that history has 
to do with life, with the thoughts, aspirations, 
and struggles of men. By the second method, 
pupils are led to deal with large and general 
ideas which are often quite beyond their com- 
prehension, ideas which are general inferences 
drawn by the learned historian from a well- 
stored treasure-house of definite data; they are 
taught to accept unquestioningly broad general- 
izations, the foundations of which they cannot 
possibly examine,—as they must do if they are to 
know how the historical student builds his infer- 
ences, or how one gains knowledge of the general 
truths of history. The first method is apt to heap
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 General History 
meaningless data together: facts crowd one upon 
another ; there is no moving drama, but at the 
very best, perhaps, a series of kaleidoscopic pic- 
tures, in which the figures are arranged with seem- 
ing arbitrariness. If the second alternative be 
followed, all is order and system; the pawns of 
the great game are folks and nations; the more 
effective chessmen are world-moving ideas. The 
experienced college teacher knows full well. that 
students entering upon historical work will learn - 
facts without seeing relationships; that ‘tend- 
ency” is a word of unknown dimensions; and that 
his first task is to lead his pupils to see how 
definite facts may be grouped into general facts, 
and how one condition of things led to another, 
until they come to a realizing sense of the fact 
that history deals with dynamics, not statics, and 
that drifts, tendencies, and movements are to be 
searched for by the proper interpretation of definite 
data, and the proper correlation of definite deeds 
and acts, with special reference to chronological 
sequence. If college students must thus be led to 
the comprehension of historical forces and general 
ideas, what hope is there that a general history, 
dealing only with tendencies, will be adapted to 
high-school needs ? 
But while we do not think that a secondary- 
school pupil can be brought to handle large gen-
-P-A-G-E-57
  Practical Basis 47 
eralizations, we do believe that, if the time devoted 
to a period of history be sufficiently long to enable 
him to deal with the acts of individual men and to 
see their work, he can be taught to group his facts; 
and that a power of analysis and construction, a 
capacity for seeing relationships and causes, an 
ability to grasp a general situation and to under- 
stand how it came to be, can be developed in him; 
and that he can be brought to see that for the 
historian nothing is, but everything is becoming. 
In all such work, however, the teacher must begin 
with ideas and facts that are not altogether unfa- 
miliar, — with the activities, the impulses, the con- 
crete conduct of men. We do not mean by this 
that constitutional and social questions cannot be 
studied, that political movements cannot be inter- 
preted, or that the biographical system suitable for 
the lower grades should be continued through the 
secondary course. On the contrary, the pupil 
should be led to general facts just as soon as pos- 
sible, and should be induced to see inferences and 
the meanings of acts at the earliest possible mo- 
ment.1_ He must not only have a well-articulated 
1 Let it be remembered that the course in history in the high 
school should have for its purpose the gradual awakening and 
developing of power. Pupils are often precipitated into general 
history, and asked to tax their powers of imagination and to grasp 
movements, when they are entirely without experience or training.  
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 General History 
skeleton of facts, but he must see movement, life, 
human energy. And yet the average pupil will 
follow the course of Julius Czsar or Augustus, 
when he cannot understand just why the Roman 
Republic was overthrown; he can know much of 
the work of Constantine, when he cannot appreciate 
the influence of Christianity on the destinies of 
Rome and the world; he can see what Charlemagne 
did, when he cannot comprehend the nature or char- 
acter of the Holy Roman Empire; he is interested 
in Danton and Mirabeau, when he cannot real- 
ize the causes, characteristics, and effects of the 
French Revolution. It is impossible for one who 
knows only of mayors, constables, and county 
clerks, to reach out at once into a comprehension 
of the great motive forces in the world’s history. 
We ask, then, for a course in history of such 
length that the pupil may get a broad and some- 
what comprehensive view of the general field, 
without having, on the one hand, to cram his mem- 
ory with unrelated, meaningless facts, or, on the 
other hand, to struggle with generalizations and 
philosophical ideas beyond his ken. We think 
that a course covering the whole field of history 
is desirable, because it gives something like a 
proper perspective and proportion; because the 
history of man’s activities is one subject, and the 
present is the product of all the past; because 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  What may be done 49 
such a study broadens the mental horizon and 
gives breadth and culture; because it is desirable 
that pupils should come to as full a realization as 
possible of their present surroundings, by seeing 
the long course of the race behind them; because 
they ought to have a general conspectus of his- 
tory, in order that more particular studies of 
nations or of periods may be seen in something 
like actual relation with others. We think, how- 
ever, that quite as important as perspective or 
proportion are method and training, and a compre- 
hension of the essential character of the study. 
In exact accord with the principles here advo- 
cated all work in natural science is now conducted: 
a pupil is taught to understand how the simple 
laws of physics or chemistry are drawn up; he 
is induced to think carefully and logically about 
what he sees, and about the meaning of the rules 
and fundamental truths which he is studying, in 
order that he may learn the science by thinking in 
it rather than by getting a bird’s-eye view of the 
field. We do not argue that secondary pupils can 
be made constructive historians, that a power can 
be bred in them to seize for themselves essential 
data and weave a new fabric, that the mysteries 
of the historian’s art can be disclosed to them, or 
that they can be taught to play upon a nation’s 
stops with an assured and cunning hand. But 
Rr 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  
50 General History 
every study has its methods, its characteristic 
thinking, its own essential purpose; and the pupil 
must be brought into some sympathy with the sub- 
ject. He must know history as history, just as he 
knows science as science. 
Any comparison between history and science is 
apt to be misleading. The method of the one 
study, for purposes of instruction at least, is not 
the method of the other: we do not suppose that 
Richelieu or William the Silent can be treated 
with any sort of moral reagent, or examined as a 
specimen under any high-power lens. And yet 
in some respects we may learn lessons from 
methods of scientific instruction. The modern 
teacher of botany does not endeavor to have his 
pupils learn a long list of classified shrubs, to 
know all the families and species by heart, or to 
make a telling synopsis of even any considerable 
section of the world’s flora; he examines a more 
limited field with care, and asks the students to 
see how seeds germinate and how plants grow, 
and to study with a microscope a piece of wood- 
fibre or the cross-section of a seed. This he 
does in order that the pupils may see the real 
subject, may know Jdotany and acquire the habit 
of thinking as men of science think; not, let 
it be understood, that he may discover new 
laws of floral growth or develop for himself a
-P-A-G-E-61
  Compared with Science 51 
single principle, rule, or system of classification. 
And so in history: while we do not urge that 
pupils be asked to extort their knowledge from 
the raw material, or to search through the docu- 
ments to find the data which learned scholars have 
already found for them, we do ask that the old 
system of classification, and the old idea that one 
must see the whole field before he studies a part 
of it, be altogether given up, if an effort to know 
the outlines of the whole means that the pupil has 
not sufficient opportunity to study history as his- 
tory, to see how men moved and acted, to know 
that history deals with the sequence of events in 
time. To insist upon a general comprehension of 
the world’s history before examining a part with 
care, would be quite as reasonable as to ask a 
pupil to study the circle of the sciences before he 
analyzes a flower or works an air-pump. 
While we believe that pupils can advantageously 
use the sources, chiefly as illustrative matter, we 
are not now arguing for the “source system” or 
insisting that they should be trained to handle 
original material. Skill in finding facts in docu- 
ments or contemporary narratives, however desira- 
ble that may be, is not the sole end of historical 
instruction anywhere, and above all in the second- 
ary schools. Even the historian is doing but a 
small part of his work when he is mousing through
-P-A-G-E-62
  52 General History 
his material, and gathering this fact and another 
from forgotten corners. One of his most impor- 
tant and most difficult tasks is to detect the real 
meaning of events, and so to put his well-tested 
data together that their proper import and their 
actual inter-relations are brought to view. His- 
tory, we say again, has to do with the sequence 
of events in time; and what we contend for is such 
a course in history as will enable one to see sequence 
and movement, — the words are not synonymous; 
this simple essential of historical work, an essential, 
however, often lost sight of completely, must not 
be neglected. We believe that the pupil should 
study history, and not something else under the 
name of history,— neither philosophy on the one 
hand, nor the art of historical investigation on 
the other. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  How the Different Blocks or 
Periods may be Treated 
WE may now briefly consider each one of the 
main divisions of the general field, and discuss the 
method in which it may best be handled. This 
portion of our report might be greatly extended, 
but we wish to confine ourselves to a consideration 
of general propositions, which are deemed impor- 
tant because they have to do with the essential 
character and purpose of the study. 
I. Ancient History 
Greek and Roman history is taught in a large 
number of the secondary schools, and in some 
schools no other branch of history is offered. This 
preference is explained by the evolution of the 
curriculum in which the Greek and Latin languages 
were long the dominant subjects, Greek and Ro- 
man history being thrust in at a later time as 
ancillary to the study of the ancient languages. In 
some schools the history remains a subordinate sub- 
53
-P-A-G-E-64
  54 Treatment 
ject, coming once or twice a week, and, even then, it 
is often in the hands of a classical instructor who is 
more interested in linguistics than in history and 
has had no training in historical method. The 
course is apt to be confined to the histories of 
Greece and Rome; the Orient is not infrequently 
omitted ; the medizeval relations of Rome are usually 
ignored. The perspective and emphasis within 
the field covered have been determined by literary 
and linguistic, rather than by historical, considera- 
tions, with the result that the chief attention is 
devoted to the periods when great writers lived 
and wrote. Too much time, for example, is com- 
monly given to the Peloponnesian war, while the 
Hellenistic period is neglected. The history of 
the early Roman Republic is dwelt upon at the 
expense of the Empire, although very little is 
known of the early times. It sometimes seems 
as if the ghost of Livy were with us yet. 
The committee thinks that the time has come 
when ancient history may be studied independently 
as an interesting, instructive, and valuable part of 
the history of the human race. Classical pupils 
need such a study, not to support their classical 
work, but to give them a wider and deeper know- 
ledge of the life, thought, and character of the an- 
cient world; and non-classical pupils need the work 
still more than the classical, for in this study they
-P-A-G-E-65
  
Ancient History 55 
are likely to find their only opportunity of coming 
into contact with ancient ideas. We ask, then, 
that ancient history be taught as history, for the 
same purpose that any other branch of history is 
taught, —in order that pupils may learn the story 
of human achievement and be trained in historical 
thinking. 
To bring out the value of ancient history, it is 
especially important that Greek and Roman history 
should not be isolated, but that there should be 
some reference to the life and influence of other 
nations, and some comprehension of the wide field, 
which has a certain unity of its own. There should 
be a short introductory survey of Oriental history, 
as an indispensable background for a study of the 
classical peoples. This survey must be brief, and 
in the.opinion of the committee should not exceed 
one-eighth of the entire time devoted to ancient 
history. It should aim to give (a) an idea of the 
remoteness of these Oriental beginnings, of the 
length and reach of recorded history ; (4) a definite 
knowledge of the names, location, and chronological 
succession of the early Oriental nations ; (c) the dis- 
tinguishing features of their civilizations, as con- 
cretely as possible; (d) the recognizable lines of 
their influence on later times. The essential factors 
in this period may perhaps best be seen by con- 
centrating attention first on the kingdoms of the
-P-A-G-E-66
  56 Treatment 
two great valleys, —that of the Nile and that of 
the Tigris and Euphrates, —and by bringing in 
the lesser peoples of the connecting regions as the 
great empires spread northward and meet. Persia 
may be taken up afterward, and its conquests may 
serve as a review of the others. 
Although, of course, Greek history should in- 
clude a short study of early times, and should dis- 
close the growth of Athens and Sparta and the 
characteristic life of the great classical period, it 
should not, on the other hand, omit an account of 
the chief events of the Hellenistic age, but should 
give some idea of the conquests of Alexander, of 
the kingdoms that arose out of them, and of the 
spread of Greek civilization over the East, so im- 
portant in relation to the influence of Greece upon 
later times. It should also give the main events 
in the later history of Greece, and should show 
the connection between Greek and Roman his- 
tory. Time for this survey may well be saved 
by omitting the details of the Peloponnesian war, 
which crowd so many text-books. This period 
should rather be used largely as connective tissue, 
to hold Greek and Roman history together; it 
should be approached first from the Greek side, 
and be reviewed afterward in connection with the 
Roman conquest of the East. Care should be 
taken to show the overlapping of Greek and Ro-
-P-A-G-E-67
Ancient History 57 
man history chronologically, and to avoid the not 
uncommon impression among pupils that Rome 
was founded after the destruction of Corinth. 
The treatment of Roman history should be suf- 
ficiently full to correspond to its importance. Too 
much time, as it seems to the committee, is often 
spent upon the period of the Republic, especially 
on the early years, and too little upon that of the 
Empire. Adequate attention is not always paid to 
the development of Roman power and the expan- 
sion of Roman dominion. Some idea should be 
given of the organization of the world-state and of 
the extension of Roman civilization. Recognizing 
fully the difficulty of this period, and not seeking 
to force upon the pupils general ideas that confuse 
them, the teacher should endeavor to make them 
acquainted, not simply with emperors and preeto- 
rian guards, but with the wide sway of Rome; 
and not so much with the “falling” of Rome, as 
with the impression left upon western Christen- 
dom by the spirit and character of the eternal city. 
This, we think, can be done by the careful use of 
concrete facts and illustrations, not by the use 
of philosophical generalizations. Probably most 
of us remember that our impressions from early 
study were that Rome really gave up the ghost 
with the accession of Augustus, —‘is that idea due 
to that good republican Livy again? And if we
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 Treatment 
studied the Empire at all, we wondered why it took 
four hundred years and more for her to tread all 
the slippery way to Avernus, when once she had 
entered upon the road. To get such an impres- 
sion is to lose the truth of Rome. 
The continuation of ancient history into the 
early Middle Ages has a manifest convenience in 
a programme of two years’ work in European his- 
tory. It secures an equitable adjustment of time, 
and a reasonable distribution of emphasis between 
the earlier and later periods. If the pupil stops his 
historical work at the end of the first year, it is 
desirable that he should not look upon classical 
history as a thing apart, but that he should be 
brought to see something of what followed the so- 
called “Fall” of the western Empire. Moreover, 
it is difficult to find a logical stopping-place at an 
earlier date: one cannot end with the introduction 
of Christianity, or with the Germanic invasions, 
or with the rise of Mohammedanism; and to 
break off with the year 476 is to leave the pupil 
in a world of confusion,—the invasions only be- 
gun, the church not fully organized, the Empire 
not wholly “fallen.” Hence, from motives of 
clearness alone, there is a gain in carrying the 
pupil on to an age of comparative order and sim- 
plicity, such as one finds in the time of Charle- 
magne. Further study of the Middle Ages then
-P-A-G-E-69
  Medizval and Modern 59 
begins with the dissolution of the Frankish Em- 
pire and the formation of new states. 
II. Medieval and Modern European History 
This field covers a period of a thousand years, 
and the history of at least four or five important 
nations ; it is necessarily, therefore, a matter of con- 
siderable difficulty to determine the best method 
by which the subject may be handled. Whether 
the whole field be covered superficially, or only 
the main lines be treated, it is highly desira- 
ble that some unity should be discovered if pos- 
sible, or that there should be some central line 
with which events or movements can be corre- 
lated. To find an assured principle of unity is 
exceedingly difficult, perhaps impossible; and it is 
very likely that writers will continue to disagree 
as to the best method of traversing this vast area. 
One way to get unity and continuity is to study 
general movements alone, without endeavoring to 
1 Such a survey of the beginnings of the Middle Ages must 
needs be quite brief, and should be confined to the primary fea- 
tures of the period, —to the Barbarian invasions, the rise of the 
Christian church and of Mohammedan civilization, the persistence 
of the empire in the East, and the growth of Frankish power to 
its culmination under Charlemagne. This practice of combining 
ancient and medizval history has been followed in a number of 
schools, and the results have been satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-70
  60 Treatment 
follow the life of any one nation; but while this 
method is possible for college classes, it may not 
be found feasible for secondary schools, where 
pupils have greater difficulty in comprehending 
general tendencies. Still, we think that certain 
essential characteristics of at least the mediaeval 
period may perhaps be studied. The period 
extending from Charlemagne to the Revival of 
Learning has a “strongly marked character, 
almost a personality of its own”; and by a selec- 
tion of proper facts some of the main character- 
istics may be brought home to the knowledge of 
the high-school pupils. The teacher or text-writer 
who attempts this method must naturally proceed 
with great caution, getting general ideas before 
the students by a judicious use of concrete facts 
and illustrations, and not failing to give some of 
the more important events and dates that mark the 
period. He will probably find that the most char- 
acteristic feature of the age is the unbroken dom- 
inance of the Roman church, and should there- 
fore bring out clearly the essential features of its 
organization, and explain the methods by which 
it exercised control in all departments of mediz- 
val life. If this is done, as it can and should be 
done, with care and impartiality, the pupil will 
receive a valuable lesson in historical truthfulness 
and objectivity, at the same time that he comes
-P-A-G-E-71
Medizval 61 
to appreciate one of the great moving forces of 
European history. 
This method of treating continental history can 
be carried throughout the Reformation period by 
remembering that while that period marks the 
end of the Middle Ages it also forms the basis 
for modern European history. This epoch must 
therefore be taught with both points of view in 
mind. The main aspects of the time must be 
brought broadly before the pupil, and he must 
be led to see that the sixteenth century is a 
century of transition; that the old order has been 
swept away; that religious, political, material, 
intellectual, and social life has been profoundly 
affected, not only by the teachings of Luther and 
Calvin, but by the development of the printing- 
press, the use of gunpowder, the voyages of Ma- 
gellan and Drake, and the change in economic 
values. The wars of religion mark the last efforts 
to reéstablish united Christendom; and, although 
the treaty of Westphalia (1648) seems well within 
the sphere of modern history, it may not improp- 
erly be selected as the end of this era of transition. 
From the close of this period, it will be found 
very difficult to treat only of movements of a gen- 
eral character affecting the life of Europe. There 
is now no great institution, like the church, which 
forms the centre of Christendom; the different
-P-A-G-E-72
  62 Treatment 
nations no longer belong to a system, but act as 
independent sovereigns ; the development of dis- 
tinct national life is now of primary concern to the 
historical student. But even in modern history, 
the method of treating epochs of international 
importance can be used to some extent. In order 
that this may be done, it will be necessary, proba- 
bly, so to connect movements or epochal charac- 
teristics with the history of particular nations that 
the separate development of the European states 
may be discerned. For example, the period from 
1648 to 1715 can be treated as the age of Louis 
XIV. ; while the history of the seventeenth-century 
monarchy, illustrated by the attitude and the admin- 
istration of Louis, is brought to light, the history of 
western Europe may be studied in its relations with 
France. The period from 1715 to 1763 is the age 
of colonial expansion, of rivalry between France 
and England; and it can be studied from either 
England or France as a point of view. The age 
of Frederick the Great (1740-1786) brings before 
us not only the rise of Prussia and the significance 
of that great fact, but the theory of enlightened 
despotism, of which Frederick was an exponent, 
and which was exemplified by the work of Cath- 
erine of Russia, Joseph II., and other enlightened 
monarchs and ministers. For the period of the 
French Revolution and the Empire (1789-1815),
-P-A-G-E-73
Modern 63 
France again may be taken as the centre from 
which to consider the international relations of 
European states, the development of the new prin- 
ciples of nationality, the sovereignty of the peo- 
ple, and the liberty of the individual. From 1815 
to 1848 Metternich may be regarded as the cen- 
tral figure; the reactionary characteristics of this 
time will naturally be dwelt upon, but the growth 
of new principles may also be illustrated, as seen 
in the establishment of independence in Greece 
and Belgium, and in the liberal monarchy of Louis 
Philippe. The system of Metternich broke down 
in 1848, and from that time to 1871 study is natu- 
rally directed to the work of Cavour and Bis- 
marck, to the unification of Italy and Germany, 
and to topics that may be easily considered in con- 
nection with these events. In attempting to give 
the pupil some idea of modern European politics 
since the establishment of the German Empire, it 
may be found advisable to treat Bismarck as the 
central figure down to 1890, and the Emperor 
William II. as the successor of Bismarck. In 
this connection, the extra-European ambitions and 
achievements of Germany, since 1871, will serve 
to bring out the fact that the history of the great 
European nations is now not only the history of 
Europe, but the history of Asia and Africa as well. 
In some such manner as this it may be possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
  64 Treatment 
to study the broad field of European history with 
special reference to movements or epochs. The 
outline is not given here as a proposal for a hard 
and fast system, but rather to illustrate the main 
principle for which we are contending; namely, 
that some principle of unity should be discovered 
which will allow definite concrete treatment, avoid- 
ing, on the one hand, philosophical generalization, 
and, on the other, tangled accounts of detailed 
events which are made meaningless by the absence 
of proper connotation. 
Another method of securing unity and contin- 
uity is to select the history of one nation, prefera- 
bly that of France, as a central thread, and study 
the development of its life. It may be that an 
understanding of the chief transitions in the his- 
tory of one nation for a thousand years is all that 
the second-year pupil should be asked to acquire. 
But probably it will be quite possible for him 
to acquire more; the Germanic migrations, the 
growth of the church, the invasions of the Sara- 
cens, the establishment of the Holy Roman Em- 
pire, feudalism, the crusades, the Renaissance, the 
rise of national monarchies, the religious wars, 
the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars, 
the unification of Germany and Italy, the demo- 
cratic movements of the present century, — these 
and other important topics have immediate rela.
-P-A-G-E-75
Episodic or Central 65 
tion to French history, and may well be studied 
in connection with it. 
This method of treatment has been followed 
satisfactorily in some schools. Many teachers 
have used English history for the purpose with 
some success, and have thus given to their pupils 
no small knowledge of what went on upon the 
continent. England however does not serve this 
purpose so well as France; we speak of this use of 
English history simply to show the practicability 
of the plan. Of course if any one nation is chosen, 
the student is apt to get an exalted idea of the part 
which that particular nation has played; and there 
is danger, too, of a lack of proportion. But con- 
sistency, simplicity, and unity are more essential 
than general comprehension; or, it might more 
truly be said, general comprehension and appre- 
ciation of proportions are almost impossible for 
boys and girls, and, if simplicity and compactness 
are wanting, there is apt to be no grasp of funda- 
mentals at all. If France be taken as a centre, 
events can be studied in sequence, the primary 
historical way of looking at things can be culti- 
vated, and the concrete acts of men can be exam- 
ined and discussed. 
If neither of the methods here suggested appeals 
to the teacher, he must seemingly do one of two 
things: he must endeavor to get a very general

view of the field, give all the main facts and dates, 
and follow the histories of the nations in parallel 
lines; or he must omit large portions of the his- 
torical field altogether, and content himself with 
the study of a few important epochs. By either 
of these modes of treatment, any effort to unify is 
in large measure given up. The first way is not 
uncommonly followed, but it often results, as the 
committee thinks, in cramming the memory with 
indigestible facts and in mental confusion; though 
an occasional effort to bind the parallel lines to- 
gether by horizontal lines will help to give unity 
and wholeness to the structure, or, to change the 
figure, an occasional view of a cross-section will 
have a like effect. The second method is adopted 
by some teachers, and they could with difficulty be 
convinced that it is not the best: they believe that 
by the intensive study of two or three epochs the 
best educational results are obtained. The Refor- 
mation, the age of Louis XIV.,.the French Revo- 
lution, and the nineteenth century might be selected 
as characteristic periods. We do not, however, 
urge this method upon the schools, or insist that 
it is the proper one. We know that it has been 
successfully used, and believe that under advan- 
tageous circumstances it will be likely to prove 
satisfactory; although the failure to give a general 
view of European history is to be regretted.

III. English History 
English history, coming in the third year of 
the school course, and completing the survey of 
European development, is exceedingly important. 
Significant as is the history of the English nation in 
itself, the study may be made doubly useful if the 
work is so conducted that it serves in some measure 
as a review of continental history and as a prepa- 
ration for American history. The pupils in our 
schools, as we have already suggested, can ill 
afford to lose such an introduction to the study of 
the history and institutions of the United States ; 
for, without a knowledge of how the English peo- 
ple developed and English principles matured, 
they can have slight appreciation of what Amer- 
ica means. Even the Revolution, for example, if 
studied as an isolated phenomenon, is bereft of 
half its meaning, to say the least, because the 
movement that ended in the separation of the colo- 
nies from the mother country and in the adoption 
of the Fedetal Constitution, began long before 
the colonies were founded, and because the 
Declaration of Independence was the formal 
announcement of democratic ideas that had their 
tap-root in English soil. 
We believe that considerable, if not the chief, 
attention should be paid to the gradual develop.
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 Treatment 
ment of English political institutions. These 
words may sound forbidding, but it is to be hoped 
that the reader of this report will not imagine that 
we think of plunging the pupil into Stubbs or Hal- 
lam. We mean simply that the main features, the 
fundamental principles and practices of constitu- 
tional government should be studied, and that the 
steps in its development should be marked. It is 
not impossible to know the leading features of the 
work of William I. and its results, the principal 
reforms of Henry II., the chief developments of 
the thirteenth century, the actual meanings of 
Tudor supremacy, the underlying causes, pur- 
poses, and results of the Puritan Revolution, the 
work of Pym and Eliot, of Robert Walpole or of 
Earl Grey. One might almost as well object to 
mathematics in the high school because quaterni- 
ons or the integral calculus are hard and abstruse, 
as to complain of the difficulty of the constitu- 
tional history of England because, when studied 
profoundly, it is, like every other subject, full of 
perplexities. The treatment must be simple, 
direct, and forcible, and its supreme object must 
be to show the long struggle for political and civil 
privileges, and the gradual growth of the cardinal 
forms and salient ideas of the English state. One 
cannot forget, even in a high-school course, that 
England is the mother of modern constitutional 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  
  English History 69 
government; that by the force of example she has 
become the law-giver of the nations. 
The pupil should be led to see how the state 
grew in power, how the government developed, 
and how it became more and more responsive to 
the popular will and watchful of individual inter- 
ests. But he ought to see more than merely 
political progress: he can be made to see, at least 
to some small extent, how the life of men broad- 
ened as the years went by, and can note some 
of the many changes in habits of living and in in- 
dustry. Such a reign as that of Elizabeth would 
yield but little of its meaning if the student should 
content himself with the hackneyed phrase of 
“Tudor absolutism” (but half true at the best), 
and did not see the social and industrial move- 
ments, the great human uprising, “the general 
awakening of national life, the increase of wealth, 
of refinement and leisure,” in that age when the 
“sphere of human interest was widened as it had 
never been widened before . . . . by the revelation of 
a new heaven and a new earth.”” The wise teacher 
will not neglect the collateral study of literature, 
but will endeavor to show that it partook of the char- 
acter of its time, as the best literature is always 
the best exponent of the age which brings it forth. 
In the study of English institutions, it is not 
wise to dwell at length upon conditions prior to the  
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 Treatment 
Norman period, and indeed even the ordinary 
political events before the time of Egbert should 
be passed over rapidly. To the secondary pupil 
the details of what Milton called the “battles of 
the kites and crows” are dreary and unprofit- 
able: apocryphal martyrdoms, legends of doubt- 
ful authenticity, and scores of unpronounceable 
names are useless burdens to the healthful memory 
of a boy of sixteen, whose mind promptly refuses 
assimilation. But the origins of later institutions, 
so far as they appear in Anglo-Saxon times, are 
not uninteresting and may well be noticed. 
When institutions familiar to us in modern life 
are fairly established the pupil’s interest is nat- 
urally awakened, and time is rightly devoted 
to their study. The jury, the offices of sheriff 
and coroner, and like matters, deserve attention; 
and something may be done even with the devel- 
opment of the common law in early England. 
But, in all the work, effort should be made to 
understand institutions that have lived rather than 
those that haygh perished ; such study cannot fail 
to bring home a sense of our indebtedness to the 
past. It is unnecessary, however, to indicate 
here in detail how the successive steps in the 
development of English institutions and of English 
liberties may be brought out ; such a presentation 
would involve a longer treatment than can be given 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  English Institutions 71 
here; but it is not out of place to say that stress 
should be laid chiefly upon the important constitu- 
tional movements and the establishment of princi- 
ples which mark a stage of progress, and are 
preparations for institutions, principles, and ideas 
that are to follow. 
In teaching English constitutional history, it is 
the institutions of south Britain that demand chief 
attention; but in teaching the history of the 
nation, as apart from that of the state, it is essen- 
tial that the common practice of neglecting Welsh, 
Scottish, and Irish history be abandoned in Amer- 
ican schools; otherwise no idea is gained of the 
composite nature of the nation which has built up 
the British Empire, and spread abroad the knowl- 
edge of English institutions and the use of the 
English language. Even in studying the early 
history, care should be taken to bring out the fact 
that there were such people as the Welsh, Scots, 
and Irish; and, although it is not advisable to 
consider in any detail the history of these nations 
in later times, yet some of the more important 
events should be dwelt upon; the relationships 
with south Britain should be kept in mind; and 
such knowledge of their development should be 
given that the final welding of all into a single 
British kingdom becomes intelligible. 
It is very desirable that the expansion and the
-P-A-G-E-82
  72 Treatment 
imperial development of Britain should receive 
adequate notice. School-books rarely lay suffi- 
cient emphasis upon this phase of the subject: 
the real meaning of the American Revolution 
is usually not disclosed; Dettingen, Fontenoy, 
and Minden sometimes obscure Louisburg, Que- 
bec, and Plassey. Without Drake, Raleigh, Clive, 
and Gordon, English history of the last three 
centuries is not English history at all. The 
colonial system also, and the general colonial 
policy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, 
demand attention in American schools; and the 
foundation of British dominion in India cannot 
rightly be made subordinate to party struggles in 
parliament or to ministerial successions. Finally, 
to trace the growth of the British Empire in the 
nineteenth century; to see how the colonists of 
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South 
Africa have obtained and used the right of self- 
government, and how the East India Company’s 
settlements have developed into an imperial 
dependency under the British crown, — these 
topics are more important than any study of 
ordinary party politics within the old sea-girt 
realm of England. 
By paying attention to the continental relations 
of England it will be possible to review the more 
important movements of European history, and to
-P-A-G-E-83
Relation to European 73 
give the pupil new views of their meanings. 
If these side-views of continental conditions are 
offered too frequently, the class may become 
confused, and lose sight even of the well-worn 
paths of English constitutional progress; judicious 
reference and comparison, however, will not be 
distracting, but will assist the pupils in appre- 
ciating the meaning of what was going on within 
the four seas. A study of English feudalism 
will give an opportunity to review what has been 
learned of the continental characteristics of that 
institution. The crusades cannot be studied as if 
Richard I. were the only king who took the cross. 
Who can understand the quarrel between Henry I. 
and Anselm, if he has no knowledge of the contest 
between Gregory and Henry of Germany? Can 
even the Norman conquest be known without 
some sense of who the Northmen were and what 
they had been doing? Does one get the force of 
the great liberal movements of the seventeenth 
century without some slight comparison between 
the Charleses of England and the Louises of 
France? Although this comparative method may 
be overdone, we believe that careful and judicious 
comparisons and illustrations will prove illuminat- 
ing, suggestive, and in all ways helpful.

It is not desirable that much time should be de- 
voted to the colonial history. The period is espe- 
cially interesting if viewed as a chapter in the 
expansion of England, a chapter in the story of the 
struggle between the nations of western Europe 
for colonies, commerce, and dominion. It must be 
viewed, too, as a time when the spirit of self-suffi- 
ciency and self-determination was growing, — a 
spirit which accounts for the Revol and for 
the dominating vigor of the later democracy. At- 
tention may be paid to the establishment of indus- 
trial conditions and of habits of industrial activity 
as explaining political differences in subsequent 
times, especially as explaining the divergence of 
North and South after constitutional union had

been formed. Slight notice should be taken of 
military campaigns in any portion of the study, 
though the importance of intercolonial wars can 
easily be underestimated, and the main facts of 
other wars, especially, of course, the Revolutionary 
and the Civil war, cannot be neglected. 
__In the study of American history it is especially. 
desirable that the development of the political or-_ ganizations be clearly brought forth. Nothing 
“should be allowed to obscure the leading features 
of our constitutional system. The pupil must see 
the characteristics of American political life and 
know the forms and methods, as well as the prin- 
ciples, of political activity. _He must_have know- 
ledge of the ideals of American life, and must study _ 
the principles of American society as they have 
themselves in civicforms. ~~” 
Much has been said about the necessity of study- 
ing the social and industrial history of the United 
States, and some practical teachers have declared 
that chiefi,stress should be laid upon social and 
economic features! of the past life of the people. 
Such a study is certainly very desirable; the stu- 
dent_should come to a realization of the nature of 
the problems of the industri him,

tory and studying economic features or conditions.

_and should see the gradual changes that have 
“been wroughtas the years have gone by. History 
should be made real to him through the study of the _ 
daily ordinary life of man, and he should be led to feel 
that only a very small portion of man’s activities or 
strivings is expresse i es, congresses, 
or ‘cabinets; that, especially under_a_ government 
such as ours, the industrial conditions, the bodily 
eople, determine ultimately, if not immediately,

ernment itself. We do not think, however, that 
economic or social facts should be emphasized at 
the expense of governmental or political facts. 
At seems_wise to say that the greatest aim of 
education is to impress upon the learner _a sense 
of duty and responsibility, and an acquaintance 
with his human obligations; and that a manifest 
function of the historical instruction in the school 
is to give to the pupil a sense of duty as a respon- 
sible member of that_organize iety_of whi 
he is a part, and some appreciation of its principles 
and its fundamental character. In other words,

and to record the gradual upbuilding of institu- _

tions, the slow establishment of political ideals _ 
and practices. 
Fortunately, as we have already suggested, 
many of the most important events in our social 
and industrial history are so intimately connected 
with the course of our political history that the 
two subjects seem not two but one. Changes in 
modes of industry or in social conditions, improve- 
ments in methods of labor, intellectual and moral 
movements, have manifested themselves in po- 
litical action, have influenced party creeds, or in 
some other way affected the forms or the conduct 
of the body politic. In a democratic country, 
any important change in the life of the people 
is of importance in political history, because the 
people are the state. Many of the economic and 
social changes, therefore, can best be studied as 
they show themselves in organized effort or are 
embodied in political institutions. If one looks at 
political activities or endeavors to understand con- 
stitutions, without knowledge of the lives and 
hopes of the people, the strivings of trade and 
commerce, the influence of inventions and dis- 
coveries, the effects of immigration, he knows but 
little of the whence or the how, and deals with 
symbols, not with things. 
__ While we believe, then, that the chief aim should 
be to give the pupil knowledge of the progress of 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
78 Treatment 
olitical institutions, ideas, and tendencies, we 
believe also that he should know the economic repaadee 
“phases of life; that whenever possible, attention “should be directed not merely to economic and “Should _be_ 
“social conditions, but to economic and social devel- alee ree 
  Social modifications should receive chief which have permanently altered social organiza-

“ideas, or governmental forms. We should in our study endeavor to see the full importance, because 
we see the results, of the fact that Virginia grew 
tobacco and South Carolina rice, and that the 
New Englanders were fishermen and went down 
to the sea in ships ; we should try to recognize the 
meanings of slavery and white servitude, of cotton 
and the sugar trade, of the steamboat, the rail- 
road, the telegraph, the rotary press, the sewing 
machine. We should see, if we can, how such 
things influenced human progress and had effect 
on the nature, organization, and destinies of the 
American people. 
Now a careful study like this is not possible for 
students in their early years. In the grades be- 
low the secondary school, use may well be made 
of mere descriptions of past times, of houses and 
apparel, of the snuff-boxes, wigs,and silken hose 
of our great-grandfathers ; for such pictures help   
  
    
-P-A-G-E-89
  
Economic History 79 
to awaken the imagination, to furnish it with food, 
to bring home the idea that men and their sur- 
roundings have changed, and to prepare the mind 
for the later growth of historical power and capa- 
cities.1 But though the pupil must know bygone 
conditions and must seek to get a vivid picture 
of the past, the ultimate ultimate aim of histor _is to dis- 
close not what was, hat was, but what became. Totally 
unrelated facts are of antiquarian rather than of 
historical interest. In the secondary school, then,

tion must be paid to_ movements, and_an_ effort _ 
“must be made to cultivate the faculty for drawin; 
truthful generalizations, for seeing and compre- 
hending tendencies. 
"We hope that from this statement no one will 
get the idea that we are waging war on economic 
history, or the study of what the Germans have 
happily called “ culturgeschichte.’ But we con-   
1 We recognize fully the historical value of many things that 
seem at first sight unimportant. When, for example, we are told 
that the old Federalists wore wigs and the Republicans did not, 
we recognize a fact that marks a change and symbolizes political 
creeds and party differences. Taine says that about the twentieth 
year of Elizabeth’s reign the nobles gave up the shield and two- 
handed sword for the rapier, — “ a little, almost imperceptible fact,” 
he remarks, “yet vast, for it is like the change which sixty years 
ago made us give up the sword at court, to leave our arms swinging 
about in our black coats.”

tend that, since there is so much to be done in a 
single year, there is no time for the study of such 
past industrial and social conditions— though they 
may be indeed interesting phenomena —as stand 
unrelated, isolated, and hence meaningless, and 
are perhaps without real historical value. _ Time 
must rather be given to the 2 important, to condi- 
  “Changes, and impulses in industrial as_ well as in 
_ Political ‘society. No study of economic forms or 
social phases should hide from view the political 
and social ideas for which our country stands, and 
which have been the developments of our history. 
We have entered upon this subject at some 
length in connection with a consideration of 
American history, because many of the state- 
ments seem important, and because much that is 
said, while peculiarly applicable to American his- 
tory, is likewise true of other fields. Especially 
in the study of English history should effort be 
made to connect economic and intellectual condi- 
tions with the progress of England, to look for 
changes in the succeeding centuries, and to see 
how political organization and social needs reacted 
one upon the other. And yet how often has Wat 
Tyler’s insurrection been studied as a mere upris- 
ing of politica] malcontents endangering the safety 
or the bodily ease of young Richard II.!_ How

often has the devastation of the North been studied 
as if it had a bearing only on the fortunes of the 
Norman dynasty! How often have inventions and 
discoveries been stated as merely isolated phenom- 
ena, — such changes, for example, as that marked 
by the use of pit-coal in the making of iron, as if 
they were of only scientific interest! 
V. Civil Government 
Much time will be saved and better results ob- 
tained if history and civil government be studied 
in large measure together, as one subject rather 
than as two distinct subjects. We are sure that, 
in the light of what has been said in the earlier 
portions of this report about the desirability of 
school pupils knowing their political surroundings 
and duties, no one will suppose that in what we 
here recommend we underestimate the value of 
civil government or wish to lessen the effective- 
ness of the study. What we desire to emphasize 
is the fact that the two subjects are in some re- 
spects one, and that there is a distinct loss of 
energy in studying a small book on American his- 
tory and afterward a small book on civil govern- 
ment, or vice versa, when by combining the two a 
substantial course may be given. 
In any complete and thorough secondary course 
G
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 Treatment 
in these subjects there must be, probably, a sepa- 
rate study of civil government, in which may be 
discussed such topics as municipal government, 
state institutions, the nature and origin of civil 
society, some fundamental notions of law and 
justice, and like matters; and it may even be 
necessary, if the teacher desires to give a complete 
course and can command the time, to supplement 
work in American history with a formal study of 
the Constitution and the workings of the national 
government. But we repeat that a great deal of 
what is commonly called civil government can 
best be studied as a part of history. To know the —————— 
present form of our institutions well, one should 
‘see whence they came and how they developed; 
but to show origins, developments, changes, is the 
TaSE-OF SITY —and Th the proper study of his. "Tory_oue secs jist These movements and knows Y_oné sees just these movements and knows _ 
their results. 
It would of course be foolish to say that the 
secondary pupil can trace the steps in the develop- 
ment of all our institutions, laws, political theories, 
and practices; but some of them he can trace, 
and he should be enabled to do so in his course in 
American history. How it came about that we 
have a federal system of government rather than 
a centralized state; what were the colonial begin- 
nings of our systems of local government; how 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  Government and History 83 
the Union itself grew into being; why the Con- 
stitution provided against general warrants; why 
the first ten amendments were adopted; why the 
American people objected to bills of attainder and 
declared against them in their fundamental law, — 
these, and a score of other questions, naturally 
arise in the study of history, and an answer to 
them gives meaning to our Constitution. Moreover, 
the most fundamental ideas in th itic: - 
ture of the United States may best be seen in_ a study of the problems of _hi: e nature 
of the Constitution as an instrument of govern- 
ment, the relation of the central authority to the 
states, the theory of state sovereignty or that of 
national unity, the rise of parties and the growth 
of party machinery,— these subjects are best 
understood when seen in their historical settings. 
But in addition to this, many, if not all, of the 
provisions of the Constitution may be seen in the 
study of history, not as mere descriptions written 
on a piece of parchment, but as they are em- 
bodied in working institutions. The best way to 
understand institutions is to see them in action; 
the best way to understand forms is to see them 
used. By studying civil government in connection 
with history, the pupil studies the concrete and the 
actual. The process of impeachment, the appoint- 
ing power of the president, the make-up of the
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 Treatment 
cabinet, the power of the speaker, the organization 
of the territories, the adoption and purpose of. the 
amendments, the methods of annexing territory, 
the distribution of the powers of government and 
their working relations, indeed all the important 
parts of the Constitution that have been translated 
into existing, acting institutions, may be studied as 
they have acted. If one does not pay attention to 
such subjects as these in the study of history, 
what is left but wars and rumors of wars, partisan 
contentions and meaningless details ? 
We do not advise that text-books on civil govern- 
ment be discarded, even when there is no oppor- 
tunity to give a separate course in the subject. 
On the contrary, such a book should always be 
ready for use, in order that the teacher may prop- 
erly illustrate the past by reference to the present. 
If the pupils can make use of good books on the 
Constitution and laws, so much the better. What 
we desire to recommend is simply this, that in any 
school where there is no time for sound, substantial 
courses in both civil government and history, the 
history be taught in such a way that the pupil will 
system which is the product of that history; and_ 
be taught, not as isolated, but as interrelated an 
interdependent subjects. Bishop Stubbs in a 
“ae
-P-A-G-E-95
ee rn Te en eT een ee 
Teaching of Government 85 
memorable sentence has said, ‘The roots of the 
present lie deep in the past, and nothing in the 
past is dead to the man who would learn how 
the present comes to be what it is.” Though we 
must not distort the past in an effort to give mean- 
ing to the present, yet we can fully understand 
the present only by a study of the past; and the 
past, on the other hand, is appreciated only by 
those who know the present.

  Methods of Instruction 
In the early part of this report, attention is 
called to the fact that there seems to be some 
agreement among teachers of history concerning 
the methods of teaching; and we have attributed 
this agreement in some measure to the recom- 
mendation of the Madison Conference, whose re- 
port has been widely read and used throughout the 
country. Doubtless there are many other reasons 
for the improvement of the last ten years, chief 
among which is the increased supply of well-trained 
teachers. There has been also a new recognition 
of the purpose of history teaching, a growing reali- 
zation on the part of teachers of why they teach 
the subject and of what they hope to accomplish. 
If one has distinctly in his mind the end that he 
seeks to gain, he will be likely to discover suitable 
means and methods of teaching. More impor- 
tant, th than method, is object: means are 
yaiuctess_to_one-whohas_no end to-be-attained. “The teacher who is seeking means and methods 
should first inquire whether he is sure that he 
knows what he wishes to accomplish.

Interest in Methods 87 
It is unnecessary for us to go into this subject 
at very great length. If teachers have been stimu- 
lated by the report of the Madison Conference, and 
have learned to obtain from it what is adapted to 
their wants, and to disregard what seems to them to 
be unsuited to their needs, they can continue to fol- 
low it. In spite of the six years of experience that 
have elapsed since that report was publisned, this 
committee will perhaps be no wiser in its recom- 
mendations and suggestions; and if there is now a 
manifest drift toward what we may be suffered to 
call “ advanced ”’ methods, the best plan may be to 
leave well enough alone, with the firm assurance 
that the best methods will be widely used only 
when there is a full realization of the purposes 
and the nature of the study. 
While discussing the value of historical work, 
we have necessarily considered the aims and ob- 
jects of instruction. .The chief _purpose is not to 
fill the _boy’s head with a mass of material, which 
he may perchance put forth again when a college 
examiner demands its production. Without under- 
estimating the value of historical knowledge, and 
deprecating nothing more than a readiness to _ 
argue and contend about the meaning of facts that _ ee ee eee ee meant 
have not been established,! we contend that the _

subject to be studied for its own sake and not merely for discipli-

accumulation of facts is not the sole, or per-_ 
“haps not thee ng, purpose of studying istory. 
No other subject in the high-school curriculum 
is stigmatized as an information study simply, 
rather than an educational study. Not even 
arithmetic — beyond decimals and percentage — 
is looked upon as valuable for the stubble that it 
stores away in the head, where the brain has not 
been called into activity or taught to use the ma- 
. terial which it is asked to retain. But for some 
unaccountable reason, it has been held that boys 
and girls must not think about historical material, 
or be taught to reason or be led to approach events 
with the historical spirit. The scientific spirit can 
be awakened and methods of scientific thinking 
cultivated; power in handling language and an 
ability for grasping grammatical distinctions can be 
developed; even the literary sense can be fostered 
and promoted; but the historical sense, the begin- 
nings of historical thinking, it is sometimes gravely 
nary purposes. The information obtained by the study is a con-\ 
tinuous source of pleasure and profit. Moreover, no subject can \ 
have the best pedagogical results if its acknowledged purpose is 
not to acquire knowledge but to get training. The mind naturally 
seizes and uses information which is at once interesting and useful; 
above all, it grasps that which is interesting because it is useful. 
By what is said in the text, we wish to emphasize the disciplinary 
value of the study, but not to belittle its value for information and 
culture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
Training 89 
said, cannot be expected ; all that one can do is to 
give information, in the hope that in some distant 
day pleasant and helpful reactions will take place 
within the brain. Fortunately, the number of per- 
sons who argue in this way has decreased and is 
decreasing, and we may well leave those that re- 
main to the intelligent teachers of history through- 
out the land, who are awake to the possibilities of 
their subject, and who see the boys and girls grow- 
ing in power and efficiency under their hands.1 
Pupils who can study physics and geometry, or 
read Cicero’s orations, must be presumed to have 
powers of logic and capacity to follow argument. 
Teachers of English put into their pupils’ hands 
such masterpieces as Burke’s “ Speech on Concili- 
ation with America” and Webster’s “Reply to 
Hayne.” It is certainly unwise to use such mate- 
rial for English work if it is impossible for boys 
and girls of sixteen to understand what these 
statesmen were talking about, or to see the force 
1 We may justly contend that an effort to store facts in pupils’ 
heads often defeats its own ends. College professors who have 
looked over entrance examination papers for many years, as most 
members of this committee have done, are struck by the marvellous 
accumulation of misinformation which has been acquired and held 
with calm belief and placid assurance. We may seriously inquire 
whether instruction in method of looking at facts and training in 
thinking about them would not leave a greater residuum of actual 
information. 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  go Methods 
of their arguments; for, if language is conceded 
to be a vehicle of ideas, it cannot be studied as a 
thing apart, without reference to its content. And 
if Burke and Cicero and Patrick Henry and Daniel 
Webster can be understood in language work, it 
seems reasonable to hold that they can be under- 
stood in history work, and hence that pupils may 
fairly be asked to think of what they see and read. 
It is not our purpose to give minute and particu- 
lar directions concerning methods of historical in- 
struction. A short list of books from which teachers 
may obtain helpful suggestions for classroom work 
will be found in Appendix VII. to this report. In 
drafting the recommendations which follow here, we 
have had in mind only certain general methods 
which we think specially useful for bringing out 
th¢-educational value of the study. 
We believe that_in most_cases the teacher __ 
should use a text-book. If the book is prepared by 
a practical teacher and a scholar, it is probably the 
product of much toil, which has been devoted to 
a consideration of proportion and order as well as 
to accuracy, and it is therefore likely to unfold the 
subject more systematically than a teacher can pos- 
sibly do unless he has wide training, long experi- 
ence, and, in addition, daily opportunity carefully to 
examine the field and to search out the nature of 
the problems that he is called upon to discuss, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  
Text-Books 91 
Without the use of a text it is difficult to hold the _ 
pupils to a definite line of work: there is danger 
we strongly advise the use of material outside of 
the text, we feel that the use of the topical method 
alone will in the great majority of instances result 
in the pupils’ having unconnected information. 
They will lose sight of the main current; and it 
is the current and not the eddies which they 
should watch. 
In some classes, especially in the more advanced 
grades, it may be possible to _use_m n_one 
“text-book. “By preparing in different books, or, 
by using more than one book on a lesson, pupils 
will acquire the habit of comparison, and the no 
less important habit of doubting whether any one 
book covers the ground.”! In an attempt to dis- 
cover the truth they may be led to study more 
widely for themselves, and will surely find that 
there are sources of information outside of the 
printed page. The use of more than one text will, 
however, often present many practical difficulties 
to the teacher; and this will surely be the case 
unless he has the time and opportunity to master 
all the texts himself and to examine outside material 
with care. In most schools there is a decided ad- 
vantage in having one line along which the class

may move. Often it may prove helpful to use 
supplementary texts, in order to amplify and 
modify the regular class-book; this may be done 
by the teacher when comparison by the class might 
proue distracting.t 
Material outside of the text-book should be 
used in all branches of in all branches of historical study and in every _ 
_year “Year of the secondary secondary course. Life and interest 
may in this way be given to the work; pupils may be 
introduced to good literature and be taught to han- 
dle books. This collateral material may be used in salted 
various ways, and of course much more should be 
expected of the later classes than of the earlier; 
indeed, there should be a consistent purpose to 
develop gradually and systematically this power of 
using books. Often, especially in the earlier years, 
the teacher will read to the class passages from en- 
tertaining histories. Younger pupils without previ- 
ous training should not be expected to find the books 
1 After this portion of the report, dealing with methods, was read, 
at the meeting of the American Historical Association, in 1898, 
one teacher expressed the opinion that the report did not suffi- 
ciently emphasize the oral recitations ; another, that we did not 
sufficiently emphasize written work; another, that we did not 
sufficiently emphasize the value of more than one text-book. We 
do not wish to underestimate any means which any teacher finds 
suited to his needs and productive of good results. Teachers must 
of course use their own discretion as to how far various methods 
may be followed ; but we think that all of the ideas and plans here 
suggested will prove helpful.
-P-A-G-E-103
Reading 93 
that treat of certain topics, or to know how to find 
the portions desired. Let the pupil learn how to 
understand and use pages before he uses books ; 
and let him learn how to use one or two books 
before he is set to rummaging in a library. For 
example, a class in the first year of the secondary 
school may be asked to tell what is said of Mara- 
thon in Botsford’s “History of Greece,” p. 121. 
A twelfth-grade class, properly trained, may be 
asked to compare Lecky’s account of the Stamp 
Act with Bancroft’s, or to find out what they can 
in the books of the library concerning the defects 
of Articles of Confederation. 
/Something in the way of written work 
should be done in every year of the secondary 
school. It is unnecessary to caution teachers 
against requiring the sort of work in the early 
years that may reasonably be expected in the 
later part of the course. Younger pupils, who 
have had little or no training in doing written work 
of this character, might be required simply to con- 
dense and put into their own language a few pages 
of Grote or Mommsen, or to write out in simple 
form some abstract of Thucydides’s account of the 
fate of the Sicilian expedition, or of Herodotus’s 
description of the battle of Thermopyle, or to do 
similar tasks. In the later years more difficult 
tasks may be assigned, demanding the use of sev-
-P-A-G-E-104
  94 Methods 
eral books and the weaving together of various 
narratives or opinions. It may be said by some 
persons that such work as this is for the English 
teacher, not for the history teacher; but it can 
hardly be asserted that skill in the use of historical 
books, practice in acquiring historical information, 
and the ability to put forth in one’s own language 
what has been read, are not objects of historical 
traiping. 
It may at times prove helpful to have _ 
written recitations or tests. Teachers have often 
found that this method secures accuracy and defi- 
niteness of statement. Some pupils who have 
difficulty in organizing and arranging the informa- 
tion which they possess, and who consequently are 
not so successful as others’ in oral recitations, 
often succeed admirably in written exercises, and 
by their success are stimulated and encouraged to 
dgghoughtful and systematic work. 
Many teachers have been aided in their work _ 
by requiring the class to keep note-books ; and the 
committee favors the adoption of this system, 
‘which has proved so_serviceable in the study of 
the sciences. These books may contain analyses 
“of the text, notes on outside matter presented in 
class, a list of books with which the pupil has 
himself become acquainted, and perhaps also some 
condensations of his reading. An analytical ar-
-P-A-G-E-105
    Written Work 95 
rangement of the more important topics that are 
discussed in the course of the study may also be 
placed in the note-book; this plan will help the 
student to see the different lines of development 
and change. For example, under the head of 
“Slavery” short statements may be inserted of 
the facts that have been learned from the text; by 
so doing the pupil will have at the end of his 
work a condensed narrative of the introduction, 
growth, and effect of slavery, and will be led to 
see the continuity of the slavery question as he 
would probably be unable to see it by any other 
megus. 
aw) Fortunately it is unnecessary in these latter 
days to call the teacher’s attention to the_use of 
maps, and to the idea that geography and history — 
are inextricably interwoven. Most text-books now 
have a number of maps, all of which however are 
by no means faultless. Good wall-maps may be 
obtained at reasonable prices; and every school 
should have at least one good historical atlas. The 
class should use physical maps, as well as those 
showing political and national divisions, for often 
the simplest and most evident facts with which 
the pupil is well acquainted need to be forced 
sharply upon his attention in connection with 
history. The Nile, the Euphrates, the Tiber, the 
Rhine, the Thames, the Mississippi, the Alps, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 Methods 
Pyrenees, the Alleghanies, —their very names call 
up to the mind of the historical scholar troops of 
facts and forces affecting the progress of the race 
and moulding the destinies of nations. The pupils 
should not lose sight of the physical causes that 
have acted in history any more than they should 
ignore the human causes; and they must remember 
that, although history deals with the succession of 
events, there is always a place relation as well as a 
time relation. As new meaning is given to geog- 
raphy when physical conditions are seen in relation 
with human life, so reality is added to historical 
occurrences and new interest is awakened in his- 
torical facts by the study of the theatre within 
which men acted and notable events took place. 
“Groupings of historical figures and scenes around 
geographical centres make these centres instinct 
with life and motion, while the centres themselves, 
binding the figures and scenes together, give them 
a new permanence and solidity.”1 The careful 
study of. physical geography and of historical 
geography is of value, therefore, not only in 
bringing out the nature or the true import of facts, 
but in helping the pupils to retain information be- 
cause they see natural causes and relations, and 
because events are thus made to appear definite 
and actual.

Geography 97 
If these methods are to be followed,— as they 
must be if history is to be a study of high educa- 
tional value, — books for reference and reading are 
as necessary as is apparatus for efficient work in 
physics or chemistry. Not many years ago all 
subjects except “natural philosophy ” were taught 
without the help of any material save a text-book 
for each pupil, and perhaps a few dusty cyclope- 
dias often deftly concealed in a closet behind the 
teacher’s desk. Great changes have been made; 
nearly all schools now have some books, but even 
at the present time it is easier to get five thousand 
dollars for physical and chemical laboratories than 
five hundred dollars for reference books; and even 
when libraries have been provided, their material 
is sometimes not wisely chosen, and they are often 
allowed to fall behind by a failure to purchase new 
and useful literature as it comes out. 
The library should be the centre and soul of all 
study in history and literature; no vital work can 
be carried on without books to which pupils may 
have ready and constant access. Without these op- 
portunities historical work is likely to be arid, if not 
unprofitable ; there cannot be collateral reading, 
or written work of the most valuable sort, or study 
of the sources, or knowledge of illustrative ma- 
terial. Even a small expenditure of money may 
change the dull routine of historical study into 
H 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 Methods 
a voyage of pleasurable discovery, awakening the 
interest, the enthusiasm, and the whole mental 
power of the pupils. No school is so poor that 
something cannot be done in the way of collecting 
material. 
The first necessity of a school library is that 
it be accessible. It should be in the school build- 
ing, open during the whole of school hours and as 
much longer as possible; it should be furnished 
with working tables and provided with good light, 
and so arranged that it serves, not as something 
helpful outside the school, but as the source and 
centre of inspiration, to which the classroom work 
is contributory. The books should be freely used, 
for a library is no longer considered a place for 
the preservation and concealment of books, but a 
centre from which they may be put into circula- 
tion, and where the best facilities are offered for 
acquiring information. The question as to whether 
the books should be left in open shelves or handed 
out by an attendant must be decided of course by 
the school authorities, in light of all the circum- 
stances; but it must be remembered that the 
opportunity to touch and handle the volumes, to 
glance at their pages, to discover the subjects of 
which they treat, to look, as it were, into their 
faces, is of great value, and that more can be 
learned by a few minutes of familiar intercourse 
\
-P-A-G-E-109
  
Libraries 99 
with a book in the hand than by many inquiries of 
an attendant or by anxious searchings in a cata- 
logue. The fewer the barriers and obstacies in 
the way the better will be the results; and the 
more will the pupil be tempted to refer to the 
authorities or to read the great masters in history 
and literature, an acquaintance with whose words, 
thoughts, and sentiments constitutes in itself no 
small part of education. 
In employing the library for historical purposes, 
care should be taken to teach the pupils how to use 
intelligently tables of contents and indexes, and 
also how to turn to their account the library cata- 
logues and the indexes to general and periodical 
literature. The teacher will remember that the 
habit of referring to authorities to settle doubtful 
points or to discover additional evidence is a most 
important part, not only of historical training, but 
of the outfit of an educated person, and that wide 
reading should bring breadth of view and also a 
broadening and deepening of the judgment. 
The well-equipped library should contain (1) 
good historical atlases and atlases of modern 
geography; (2) one or two historical handbooks, 
or dictionaries of dates; (3) an ample supply of 
secondary histories, such as those of Holm, 
Mommser, Lecky, Parkman; with these may be 
classed, as especially useful, good, interesting bi-
-P-A-G-E-110
100 Methods 
ographies, such as Dodge’s “ Alexander the Great,” 
Stanhope’s “ Pitt”; (4) there should certainly be 
some collections of sources, many of which are 
now accessible ; and some of the recent leaflets and 
collections of extracts of primary and secondary 
material will be found of service; (5) a good ency- 
clopzedia and one or two annual compendiums, 
such as the various political almanacs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  Sources 
TuE use of sources in secondary work is now a 
matter of so much importance, that it seems to 
demand special and distinct treatment. We believe 
in the proper use of sources for proper pupils, with 
proper guarantees that there shall also be secured 
a clear outline view of the whole subject studied ; 
but we find ourselves unable to approve a method 
of teaching, sometimes called the ‘‘ source method,” 
in which pupils have in their hands little more than 
aseries of extracts, for the most part brief, and 
not very closely related. The difficulty with this 
system is, that while it suggests the basis of 
original record upon which all history rests, on the 
other hand it expects valuable generalizations from 
insufficient bases. Within the covers of one book 
it is impossible to bring together one hundredth part 
of the material which any careful historical writer 
would examine for himself before coming to a con- 
clusion ; and it is not to be expected that inexperi- 
enced and immature minds can form correct notions 
without some systematic survey of the field. In- 
deed the attempts to teach history wholly from the 
101  
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 Sources 
sources ignore the fact that the actual knowledge of 
the facts of history in the minds of the most highly 
trained teachers of history, comes largely from sec- 
ondary books; it is only in limited fields, where a 
large mass of material can be examined and sifted, 
that historians and teachers can safely rely for their 
information entirely on sources, and even there they 
find it useful to refer to the secondary work of other 
writers for new points of view. 
Bie peorntia then, for any practical use of 
sources by pupils, is that their work shall be 
done in connection with a good text-book, in which 
the sequence and relation of events can be made_ 
clear. The aim of historical study in the second- 
ary school, let it be repeated, is the training of 
pupils, not so much in the art of historical investi- 
“gation as in that of thinking historically. Pupils 
should be led to grasp facts and to see them in 
relations, for one who has been taught to establish 
certain facts with unerring accuracy may still be 
unable to understand the historical significance of 
those facts. 
In the@cond)place, we disclaim_any confidence — 
in “investigation” by pupils, if by investigation 
is meant a mental process of the same order as that 
of the practised_historian_and the special student 
“terial for his | Classes. _ In our judgment, sources 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
  Use of Text-Book 103 
are not intended to be either the sole or the princi ..pal materials for school st study. | There is, indeed, a 
close analogy between the proposed processes of 
historical study and those of the study of natural 
science. In physics, for example, it has been 
thought expedient to require a well-ordered text- 
book in connection with a series of experiments ; 
yet physics cannot be efficiently taught unless the 
pupil has some contact with materials, not because 
they form the only foundation of his knowledge, 
but because he learns to look for himself, and to 
understand that the knowledge which he receives 
at second-hand must be based upon patient investi- 
gation by somebody else. 
By the study of properly selected materials, the 
pupil realizes that historical characters were living 
persons, and he learns to distinguish between them 
and the x and y of algebra or the formulas of 
physics. When one reads the loving letter written 
from before Antioch by Count Stephen of Blois 
some eight hundred years ago,1in which he charges 
his wife to do right and to remember her duty to her 
children and her vassals, one realizes that the Cru- 
saders were real men, imbued with many of the 
purposes, hopes, and sentiments with which men 
of the present day are moved and influenced.

vania Translations and Reprints), 1-4.  
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 Sources 
The use of sources which we advocate is, there- 
fore, a limited contact with a limited body of mate- 
rials, an examination of which may show the child 
the nature of the historical process, and at the same 
time may make the people and events of bygone 
times more real to him. We believe that some 
acquaintance with sources vitalizes the subject, 
and thus makes it easier for the teacher and more 
stimulating for the pupil. But all sources are not 
of equal value for this purpose; some of those 
which are very important for more mature students 
are too dry and unattractive to be useful for 
younger persons. John Adams’s “ Discourses of 
Davila” is a source, though thought exceedingly 
dull even in his generation. Abigail Adams’s 
letters to her husband, complaining of the fall of 
continental currency, are equally valuable as 
sources, and much more interesting. 
Since discrimination in the selection of sources 
is of so much importance, the first criterion is, that 
authorities be chosen whose authenticity is beyond 
dispute. It is not worth while to introduce chil- 
dren to the controversies over the voyages of John 
and Sebastian Cabot ; or to the arguments for and 
against the truthfulness of John Smith’s account of 
his rescue by Pocahontas; or to the authorship of 
the letters found in the saddle-bags of Charles I. 
There is no difficulty in obtaining an abundance
-P-A-G-E-115
  
Limitations 105 
of suggestive sources, about the value of which 
historians will agree and around which no inter. 
minable controversy is waging. Pains should also 
be taken to recommend the sources that may 
reasonably be brought within the knowledge of 
pupils; it is of no use to refer to rarities or to 
texts long out of print. 
In the next place, few documents, in the usual 
significance of that term, are very useful in the 
schoolroom. A capitulary of Charlemagne, Magna 
Charta, a colonial charter, or the Constitution of 
the United States may with careful explanation 
be made clear; but it is difficult to make them 
attractive. The growth of a nation, the enlarge- 
ment of its political ideas, may be measurable by 
young intellects, but not the registration of that 
growth in great political documents. And yet 
even documents may be occasionally used. There 
seems to be no good reason for merely reading 
about the Declaration of Independence without 
seeing the printed instrument itself, or talking 
about the Ordinance of 1787 or the Proclamation 
of Emancipation without knowledge of the texts. 
There is, however, a large body of material of 
another kind which is as trustworthy as constitu- 
tional documents and is much more attractive. 
Such are books of travels, which from Herodotus 
down to James Bryce have been one of the most 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  106 Sources 
entertaining and suggestive sources on the social 
and intellectual phenomena of history. Of equal 
interest, and perhaps of greater value, are the 
actual journals and letters of persons contemporary 
with the events which they describe. Such are 
Cicero’s “Epistles,” Luther’s “ Letters,” Pepys’ 
“Diary,” Bradford’s “History,” and the more 
intimate writings of statesmen like Henry VIII. 
of England and Henry IV. of France, Frederick 
the Great, Franklin, Washington, and Gladstone. 
These are unfailing sources of historical informa- 
tion, and they give in addition a personal and 
human interest to the subjects which they illus- 
trate. 
In dealing with young minds which are rapidly 
opening, it is of special importance to choose 
books or extracts which have a literary value. 
The annals of the race are founded on first-hand 
accounts of historical events, many of which are 
written in such a fashion as to be worth reading 
aside from their historical value. Such are, for 
example, Einhard’s “ Life of Charlemagne”; the 
naive accounts of the foundation of the Swiss Re- 
public in 1292; the journals of the early voyagers 
to the Western world; the table-talk of Bismarck ; 
the farewell letters of John Brown; and the mem- 
oranda of Lincoln’s few brief speeches. Such 
material used in schools gives part of the training

Topical Work 107 
and enjoyment to be had from good literature, 
and at the same time furnishes illustrations that 
make the text-book of history sparkle with human 
life. 
_In connection with topical work, the pupils may _ 
with special advantage make use of the sources. 
“To the child such work is as fresh as though it 
had never been undertaken by any other mind. 
In comparing the statements of various sources 
and arriving at a conclusion from taking them to- 
gether, the pupil gets a valuable training of judg- 
ment. He must not suppose that he is making a 
history, or that his results are comparable with 
those of the trained historian; but he may have 
an intellectual enjoyment of the same kind as 
that of the historical writer. The committee is 
fully aware of the difficulty of carrying on such 
methods as are here suggested ; they require advan- 
tageous circumstances and material which is easily 
handled and with which the teacher has decided 
familiarity. As has been pointed out above, 
written work must not be the only or even 
the principal employment of the pupil, but in 
the preparation of written topics much may be 
gained by dealing with sources, if a sufficient 
variety is available. Wherever written work is 
required, therefore, it is desirable to have some 
sources, to be used not merely for help in writing
-P-A-G-E-118
  
108 Sources 
but for reference. In this way the pupil may 
get an idea of the difficulties of ascertaining his- 
torical truth, and of the necessity for impartiality 
and accuracy. 
Besides the sources which have come down to 
us in written form and are reproduced upon the 
printed page, there is another important class of his- 
torical materials which is of great assistance in giv- 
ing reality to the past, — namely, actual, concrete 
remains, such as exist in the form of old buildings, 
monuments, and the contents of museums. Many 
schools have direct access to interesting survivals 
of this sort, while the various processes of pictorial 
reproduction have placed abundant stores of such 
material within reach of every teacher. The ex- 
cellent illustrations of many recent text-books may 
be supplemented by special albums, such as are 
used in French and German schools, and by the 
school’s own. collections of engravings and photo- 
graphs cut from magazines or procured from 
dealers.1_ Some schools have also provided sets 
1 Selections from the Perry prints, and the cheap series of pho- 
tographic reproductions issued by various American houses, are

vigues of Parmentier (Paris, Hachette). MHolzel in Vienna pub- 
lishes Langl’s Bilder zur Geschichie, a set of sixty-two wall pictures

of lantern slides. Of course in order to entitle 
such illustrations to serious use and to the rank of 
historical sources they must be vea/ pictures, — 
actual reproductions of buildings, statues, contem- 
porary portraits, views of places, etc.,—and not 
inventions of modern artists. It is easy to make 
too much of illustrations and thus reduce history 
to a series of dissolving views; but many excellent 
teachers have found the judicious use of pictures 
helpful in the extreme, not merely in arousing 
interest in the picturesque aspects of the subject, 
but in cultivating the historical imagination and in 
giving definiteness and vividness to the pupil’s 
general ideas of the past. An appeal to the eye 
is of great assistance in bringing out the charac- 
teristic differences between past and present, and 
thus in checking that tendency to project the 
present into the past which is one of the most 
serious obstacles to sound views of history. The 
chief danger in the use of pictorial material lies in 
giving too much of it instead of dwelling at length 
on a few carefully chosen examples. 
To sum up this part of the subject, the com- 
mittee looks upon sources as adjuncts to good text- 
book work, as something which may be used for a 
part of the collateral reading and may also form 
the basis of some of the written work. Such use 
of material, with proper discrimination in choosing 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  IIo Sources 
the sources, will add to the pleasure of the pupil, 
and will by sharpness of outline fix in his mind 
events and personalities that will. slip away if he 
uses the text-books alone.

  Intensive Study 
TuaT we have not dwelt at any length upon the 
desirability of devoting time to what is termed by 
the Madison Conference “intensive study,” is 
because we do not see how in many schools suf- 
ficient time can be given to such work, and not 
because we advise against the adoption of that 
plan of work if there is time and opportunity in 
the school course. Indeed, we believe that the 
careful examination of a very limited period is 
highly beneficial. By intensive study we do not 
mean original work in the sense in which the word 
“original” is used in advanced college classes ; 
we mean simply the careful and somewhat pro- 
longed study of a short period. The shorter the 
period and the longer the time devoted to it, 
the more intensive the study will be. Perhaps in 
the courses in English and American history, time 
may be found to study one or two periods with 
special care and attention, so that the pupil may 
have exceptional opportunities to read the best 
secondary authorities, and even to examine pri- 
Ill

  112 Intensive Study 
mary material. For example, in English history 
it may prove possible to give two or three weeks, 
instead of two or three days, to a study of the im- 
portant events and meanings of the Common- 
wealth, or to the ideas and progress of the whole 
Puritan movement. In American history it may 
be wise to study for a considerable time such sub- 
jects as the causes of the Revolution, or the Con- 
federation and the formation of the Constitution, 
or the chief events of the decade from 1850 to 
1860. When this plan of selecting a period or 
a topic for intensive examination is possible, the 
pupils can gain great advantage by the oppor- 
tunity of delving deeper into the subject than is 
possible when all parts of the work are studied 
with equal thoroughness or superficiality: they 
can read more in the secondary material, can get 
a peep at the sources, and thus come to a fuller 
appreciation of what history is and how it is writ- 
ten. Only when good working facilities are at 
hand, however, and the teacher, knowing the ma- 
terial, has time to guide his pupils and give them 
constant aid and attention, will this plan prove 
very helpful.
-P-A-G-E-123
The Need of Trained Teachers 
Ir history is to take and hold its proper place in 
the school curriculum, it must be in the hands of 
teachers who are thoroughly equipped for the task 
of bringing out its educational value. It is still 
not very unusual to find that history is taught, if 
such a word is appropriate, by those who have 
made no preparation, and that classes are some- 
times managed — we hesitate to say instructed — 
by persons who do not profess either to be pre- 
pared or to take interest in the subject. In one 
good school, for example, history a short time ago 
was turned over to the professor of athletics, not 
because he knew history, but apparently in order 
to fill up his time. In another school a teacher 
was seen at work who evidently did not have 
the first qualifications for the task; when the ex- 
aminer inquired why this teacher was asked to 
teach history when she knew no history, the an- 
swer was that she did not know anything else. 
As long as other subjects in the course are given 
to specialists, while history is distributed here and 
I 113
-P-A-G-E-124
14 Trained Teachers 
there to fill up interstices, there can be no great 
hope for its advancement. Fortunately, however, 
this condition of things is disappearing as history 
gradually finds its way to a place beside such sub- 
jects as Latin and mathematics, which claim a pre- 
scriptive right to first consideration. 
» Doubtless to teach history properly is a difficult 
task. It requires not only wide information and 
accurate knowledge, but a capacity to awaken 
enthusiasm and to bring out the inner meanings 
of a great subject. Accuracy and definiteness 
must be inculcated in the pupil, and he must be 
led to think carefully and soberly; but he must 
also be tempted to range beyond the limits of the 
text and to give rein to his imagination. Pupils 
often complain that, while in other studies a lesson 
can be thoroughly mastered, in history every topic 
seems exhaustless. Teachers are constantly con- 
fronted with the same difficulties. So many 
problems arise and demand attention; so diffi- 
cult is it to hold the pupil to definite facts, and 
yet help him to see that he is studying a scene in 
the great drama of human life which has its per- 
petual exits and entrances; so hard a task is it to 
stimulate the imagination while one is seeking to 
cultivate the reason and the judgment. that the 
highest teaching power is necessary to complete 
success.
-P-A-G-E-125
  
Knowledge 115 
The first requisite for good teaching is know- 
ledge. The teacher’s duty is not simply to see that 
the pupils have learned a given amount, or that 
they understand the lesson, as one uses the word 
“understand” when speaking of a demonstration 
in geometry or an experiment in physics. His 
task is to bring out the real meaning and import 
of what is learned by adding illustrations, showing 
causes and suggesting results, to select the impor- 
tant and to pass over the unimportant, to empha- 
size essentials, and to enlarge upon significant facts 
and ideas. A person with a meagre information 
cannot have a wide outlook; he cannot see the 
relative importance of things unless he actually 
knows them in their relations. 
But knowledge of facts alone is notenough. In 
historical work pupils and teacher are constantly 
engaged in using books. These books the teacher 
must know; he must know the periods which they 
cover, their methods of treatment, their trustworth- 
iness, their attractiveness, their general utility for 
the purposes of young students. He must have 
skill in handling books and in gleaning from them 
the information which he is seeking, because it is 
just this skill which he is trying to give to his 
pupils. No one would seriously think of putting 
in charge of a class in manual training a person 
who had himself never shoved a plane or measured
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 Trained Teachers 
aboard. To turn over a class in history to be in- 
structed by a person, who is not acquainted with 
the tools of the trade and has had no practice in 
manipulating them, is an equal absurdity. 
A successful teacher must have more than mere 
accurate information and professional knowledge. 
He needs to have a living sympathy with the tale 
which he tells. He must know how to bring 
out the dramatic aspects of his story. He must 
know how to awaken the interest and atten- 
tion of his pupils, who will always be alert and 
eager if they feel that they are learning of the actual 
struggles and conflicts of men who had like pas- 
sions with ourselves. Though stores of dates and 
names must be at the teacher’s command, these are 
not enough. He must have had his own imagina- 
tion fired and his enthusiasm kindled; he must 
know the sources of historical knowledge and the 
springs of historical inspiration ; he must know the 
literature of history and be able to direct his pupils 
to stirring passages in the great historical masters; 
he must know how to illumine and brighten the 
page by readings from literature and by illustra- 
tions from art. 
“It were far better,” says Professor Dicey, “as 
things now stand, to be charged with heresy, or 
even to be found guilty of petty larceny, than to fall 
under the suspicion of lacking historical-minded-
-P-A-G-E-127
  Point of View 117 
ness, or of questioning the universal validity of the 
historical method.” To cultivate historical-minded- 
ness, to teach pupils to think historically and to 
approach facts with the historical spirit, —this is 
the chief object of instruction in any field of his- 
tory. But unless the teacher has had practice in 
dealing with facts, unless he has acquired per- 
spective, unless he has become historical-minded 
and knows himself what the historical method is, 
he cannot instruct his pupils. These character- 
istics cannot be absorbed from a text-book in an 
hour or two before the recitation; they are the 
products of time and toil. 
Possibly the day is far distant when all teachers 
in this country will be prepared for their duties by 
a long course of training such as is required of a 
teacher in European schools; but there are a few 
evidences that this time is slowly approaching. 
Beyond all question, some of the best teachers in 
our secondary schools are almost wholly self- 
trained ; some of them are not college graduates. 
But these exceptions do not prove that advanced 
collegiate training and instruction are undesirable. 
In teaching a vital subject like history, much de- 
pends upon the personality of the teacher, upon his 
force, insight, tact, sympathy, upon qualities that 
cannot be imparted by the university courses or 
by prolonged research. Though all this be true, 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 Trained Teachers 
every teacher should have had some instruction in 
methods of teaching, and should have learned from 
precept what are the essentials of historical study 
and historical thinking; and—what is of much 
greater importance — he should have so worked 
that he knows himself what historical facts are 
and how they are to be interpreted and arranged. 
The highly successful teacher in any field of work 
needs to be a student as well as a teacher, to be in 
touch with the subject as a growing, developing, 
and enlarging field of human knowledge.

College Entrance Requirements! 
Any consideration of college entrance require- 
ments presents many difficulties; but probably no 
field of work offers greater problems than does that 
of history, because the schools have no common 
understanding as to the amount of history that 
should be offered in the curriculum, and because the 
universities differ materially in their requirements. 
The first fundamental fact to be remembered is 
that a very large percentage of secondary pupils 
do not go to college, and that in a very great 
majority of schools the courses must be adapted 
primarily for the pupils who finish their study with 
1In 1896, the National Educational Association appointed a 
committee to consider the subject of college entrance requirements, 
and to report a scheme of uniform requirements. At the request 
of that committee, the American Historical Association appointed 
the Committee of Seven to draft a scheme of college entrance re- 
quirements in history. The portion of our report that here follows 
was prepared with that purpose in mind ; and substantially similar 
recommendations have already been made to Superintendent Night- 
ingale, as chairman of the committee of the National Educational 
Association,

the secondary school. It is often asserted that the 
course which fits pupils for college is equally well 
adapted to the uses of those who do not go to 
college. We do not care to argue this question, 
although we doubt very much if it be true that the 
requirements laid down for entrance to college, 
requirements which still bear the mark of the old 
régime, are likely to furnish the best equipment for 
the work and play of everyday life. Whether 
this be true or not, it is certainly wrong to shape 
secondary courses primarily with a view to college 
needs. In the great majority of schools the cur- 
riculum must be prepared with the purpose of 
developing boys and girls into young men and 
women, not with the purpose of fitting them to 
meet entrance examinations or of filling them with 
information which some faculty thinks desirable as 
a forerunner of college work. Many of the acade- 
mies and some of the high schools can without 
much trouble meet the artificial requirements of 
the colleges; but a great majority of the high 
schools and some of the academies have great dif- 
ficulty ; and it is an almost impossible task so to 
arrange the programme that pupils can be fitted 
for more than one institution.1 
1 For example, in a catalogue of a good high school, —a school 
rather large than small, and well-equipped with teachers, — we 
find these typical statements: that a pupil may prepare in that school
-P-A-G-E-131
  
Fitting Schools 121 
For this reason we welcome the efforts of the 
committee of the National Educational Associa- 
tion to simplify and unify college entrance re- 
quirements. We believe, however, that the first 
requisite of a successful accomplishment of this 
task is a recognition of the fact that the great 
majority of schools are not fitting-schools for 
college; and it seems to us that any rigid and 
inelastic 7ég?me, which does not take into consid- 
eration the fact that schools are working in many 
different environments and are subject to different 
limitations and conditions, cannot be very widely 
accepted or prove useful for any length of time. 
We venture to suggest, therefore, that in any 
effort to simplify the situation by relieving the 
schools from the burden of trying to meet college 
requirements, two things are essential; one is, that 
the fundamental scope and purpose of the major 
part of the secondary schools be regarded; the 
other, that such elasticity be allowed that schools 
may: fit pupils for college and yet adapt them- 
selves to some extent to local environment and 
local needs.! 
for one of several universities, but that at the beginning of the 
second year he should know what he intends to do; and that a 
failure to choose accurately in any one semester involves the loss 
of a year. 
1 Jt does not seem wise, even if it be possible, to outline the 
same rigid entrance requirements for the University of California,
-P-A-G-E-132
  122 Entrance Requirements 
We feel justified, therefore, as students and 
teachers, in marking out what we think is the 
best etteituin in history, in discussing the edu- 
cational value of the study, in emphasizing the 
thought that history is peculiarly appropriate in 
a secondary course, which is fashioned with the 
thought of preparing boys and girls for the duties 
of daily life and intelligent citizenship, and in 
dwelling upon methods for bringing out the peda- 
gogical effect of historical work. It seems to us 
that, in consideration of the value and importance 
of historical work, and in light of the fact that 
so many thousands of pupils are now engaged in 
historical study, the colleges should be ready to 
admit to their list of requirements a liberal amount 
of history ; but we do not feel that we should seek 
to lay down hard-and-fast entrance requirements in 
history and ask the colleges or the committee of 
the National Educational Association to declare in 
favor of an inflexible régime. 
For convenience of statement we have adopted, 
in the recommendations which follow, the term 
“unit”; by one unit we mean either one year of 
historical work wherein the study is given five   
University of Kansas, University of North Carolina, Yale, Har- 
vard, Tulane, and a hundred others. This policy would mean that 
secondary schools everywhere throughout the country must dis- 
regard local conditions and yield to an outside force,
-P-A-G-E-133
  Recommendations 123 
times per week, or two years of historical work 
wherein the study is given three times per week. 
We have thought it best to take into consideration 
the fact that different colleges have now not only 
different requirements, but also entirely different 
methods of framing and proposing requirements. 
It has not seemed wise, therefore, to outline his- 
torical courses on the supposition that all colleges 
would at once conform to a uniform arrange- 
ment. 
1. If a college or a scientific school has a sys- 
tem of complete options in college entrance re- 
quirements, that is, if it accepts a given number of 
years’ work, or units, without prescribing specific 
subjects of study (as at Leland Stanford Univer- 
sity), we recommend that four units in history be 
accepted as an equivalent for a like amount of 
work in other subjects. Likewise, that one, two, 
or three units in history be accepted. 
2. If a college or a scientific school requires a 
list of certain prescribed studies, and also demands 
additional subjects, to be chosen out of an optional 
list (as at Harvard University), we recommend 
that one unit of history be placed on the list of 
definitely prescribed studies, and that one, two, or 
three units of history be placed among the optional 
studies. 
3. If a college or a scientific school has rigid
-P-A-G-E-134
  124 Entrance Requirements 
requirements without options (as at Yale College 
and the Sheffield Scientific School), we recommend 
that at least one unit of history be required for 
entrance. 
These recommendations do not seem to us un- 
reasonable, and we do not believe that their adop- 
tion would impose any burden upon college or 
preparatory schools. If the traditional requirements 
in other subjects need to be diminished in order to 
allow one unit of history in any régime of rigid 
requirements, we do not think that such diminution 
is unwise in light of the fact that history is now 
generally studied, and that the training obtained 
from historical work is an essential of good sec- 
ondary education. It will be seen from the state- 
ment which follows (under 4), that we do not 
recommend any particular field or period of his- 
tory as preferable to all others for the purpose 
of such requirements; to constitute this unit any 
one of the periods or blocks of history previously 
mentioned may be selected. 
4. Where a college has several distinct courses 
leading to different degrees, and has different 
groups of preparatory studies, each group pre- 
paring for one of the college courses (as at the 
University of Michigan), the use to be made of 
history requires more detailed exposition. In one 
of these preparatory courses the ancient languages
-P-A-G-E-135
  Units 125 
receive chief attention; in a second, a modern 
language is substituted for one of the ancient lan. 
guages; in a third, the chief energy is devoted to 
natural sciences; in a fourth, main stress is laid 
upon history and English language and literature. 
The general recommendations given above will aid 
somewhat in outlining preparatory courses in his- 
tory when such definite routes for admission to 
college are marked out : — 
A. We believe that in each preparatory course 
there should be at least one unit of history. This 
recommendation means that classical students 
should have at least one full year of historical 
work. A course which purports to deal with 
the “humanities” cannot afford to be without 
one year’s work in a study whose sole theme is 
humanity. When four years are given to Latin, 
two or more to Greek, two or three to mathe- 
matics, one, or perchance two, to science, some 
room should be found for history, even if the time 
given to other studies be diminished. If we take 
for granted the fact that the great majority of sec- 
ondary pupils do not go to college, can we declare 
that they should go out into life with no knowledge 
of, the humanities save that acquired by the study 
of the Greek and Latin tongues ? 
| ‘o decide what field of history should be chosen 
is a matter of considerable difficulty. We believe
-P-A-G-E-136
126 Entrance Requirements 
it desirable that pupils should know the life and 
thought of Greece and Rome and the development 
of their civilization; that they should study the 
great facts of European history after the downfall 
of the Roman Empire; that they should have 
some knowledge of how England grew to be a 
great empire and English liberty developed; and 
that they should come to know their own political 
surroundings by studying American history and 
government. We hesitate, therefore, to recom- 
mend that any one particular field be chosen to the 
exclusion of the rest; and yet we think that far 
better educational results can be secured by de- 
voting a year to a limited period than by attempt- 
ing to cover the history of the world in that length 
of time. We believe that it is more important 
that pupils should acquire knowledge of what his- 
tory is and how it should be studied than that they 
should cover any particular field. 
Perhaps it is not impossible, in connection with 
the study of Greek and Latin, to pay such atten- 
tion to the growth of Greece and Rome that the 
pupils may be led to an appreciation of the char- 
acter and essential nature of ancient civilization. 
This is one of the great ends of historical work ; 
and if the humanities can thus be humanized, 
there will be less need of prescribing Greek or 
Roman history as a distinct subject for classical
-P-A-G-E-137
  
Various Courses 127 
students,! and some other historical field may 
then be chosen. We cannot be sure, however, 
that such methods of teaching the classics will 
prevail; and we must content ourselves with 
recommending one of the four blocks or periods 
which are marked out in the earlier portions of 
this paper, without designating any particular 
one. 
B. The secondary course, sometimes called the 
Latin course, in which a modern language takes 
the place of Greek, presents nearly the same 
problems as the classical course. It does not 
afford much time for the study of history; we 
therefore recommend that some one of the four 
blocks mentioned above be selected. 
C. In the scientific secondary course more op- 
portunity for historical study is often allowed, and 
here two units of history may be given. At 
least one of them will naturally be a modern field, 
and yet it may be said that it is highly desir- 
able that scientific pupils should by the study of 
ancient history obtain something of the culture 
which is not wrongly supposed to come from the 
study of classical civilization. 
1 That the desirability of such a method is recognized by many 
classical teachers is shown, for example, by the paper by Professor 
Clifford Moore on How to Enrich the Classical Course, published 
in the School Review, September, 1898. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 Entrance Requirements 
D. The fourth secondary course, commonly 
called the English course, should have history for 
its backbone, inasmuch as it is a study peculiarly 
capable of being continued throughout the four 
years, and of offering that opportunity for con- 
tinuous development which the classical pupil 
obtains from the prolonged study of Latin. We 
strongly advise that sustained effort be devoted to 
history in order that this course may have a certain 
consistency and unity. There are already schools 
that offer history for four years, and give four full 
units consisting substantially of the four blocks 
we have outlined. If the four full units can- 
not be given, it may be well to offer history only 
three times a week in one of the four years. If 
only three years can be devoted to the study, one of 
the four blocks must, as we have already said, be 
omitted, or two fields must be compressed in some 
such manner as that suggested in the earlier 
portion of this report. 
The general recommendations under this head 
may then be summed up as follows: (@) for the 
classical course, one unit of history, to consist 
of one of the four blocks previously mentioned ; 
(4) for the Latin course, the same; (c) for the sci- 
entific course, two units consisting of any two of 
the blocks ; (¢) for the English course, three units 
1 See above, p. 43.  
-P-A-G-E-139
  Minimum 129 
consisting of any three of the blocks, or consisting 
of two blocks and a combination of two others. 
We strongly recommend that four years of history 
be given in this course, in order to make history 
one of the central subjects. 
It should be said in conclusion that, in demand- 
ing but one unit of history as the minimum require- 
ment for entrance to a college or a scientific school, 
the committee does not wish to be understood as 
expressing its approval of this amount as an ade- 
quate course in history for secondary schools. In 
this portion of the report we have been obliged to 
work within the limits of the systems of entrance 
requirements that now prevail, and to frame 
recommendations that may be adapted to existing 
conditions; but we do not believe that a single 
unit of history constitutes a sufficient course, 
viewed with reference either to the relative impor- 
tance of the subject, or to the possibility of realiz- 
ing the aims of historical instruction within the 
time that would thus be at the teacher’s disposal. 
The arguments for the necessity of a comprehen- 
sive and substantial course in history have been 
presented at length in the earlier sections of this 
report; and though it may not at present be feasi- 
ble for every college to require more than one unit 
of history, the committee believes that two units 
should constitute the minimum amount offered in 
K  
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 Entrance Requirements 
any school, and it maintains that a still more 
extended course in history has claims quite equal 
to those that may be urged on behalf of any other 
study in the secondary curriculum. 
Entrance Examinations 
One subject connected with college entrance 
requirements has peculiar importance in connec- 
tion with the study of history, namely, that of 
entrance examinations. Higher institutions that 
admit students on the basis of certificates need 
have no administrative difficulty in giving large 
recognition to history as a preparatory subject; 
but in colleges and universities that can be entered 
only after passing examinations, the problem is 
somewhat different. As has been emphasized else- 
where in this report, the utility of historical study 
lies not only in the acquisition of certain important 
facts, but in great measure in its indirect results in 
training the powers of discrimination and judg- 
ment; it will often happen that pupils who have 
profited largely from their study of history will, 
especially after two or three years have elapsed, 
show surprising /acune in their stores of historical 
information. While a course in history should be 
progressive and build steadily upon what has gone 
before, one stage does not depend so immediately
-P-A-G-E-141
  Examinations 131 
upon the preceding, and involve so persistent a 
review of earlier work, as is the case in language 
and mathematics; and besides, growth in power 
of historical thinking is much harder to measure 
than progress in mathematical knowledge or in 
linguistic facility. These difficulties are present in 
some degree, even when the candidate is examined 
on work done in history in the last year of the 
secondary school; but they become exceedingly 
serious when the subject has been studied some 
years before, or when the course in history covers 
two, three, or four years of the period of secondary 
instruction. 
The remedy, in our opinion, lies, not in the ex- 
clusion or unnatural restriction of history as a sub- 
ject for entrance, but in the reform of methods of 
examination in history; if the present system of 
entrance examination does not—and it generally 
does not — properly test the qualifications of can- 
didates in history, it is time to consider how it may 
be changed. Certainly nothing has done more to 
discredit history as a subject for college entrance 
than the setting of papers which demand no more 
preparation than a few weeks’ cram. The sug- 
gestions which follow are offered in the hope, not 
that they will afford a final solution of the problem, 
but that they may prove helpful in bringing about 
amore just and adequate system of examinations
-P-A-G-E-142
  132 Entrance Requirements 
in history. The complete adoption ot them will 
naturally involve a larger allotment of time to his- 
tory than is now given in examination schedules, 
and will impose a heavier burden upon those to 
whose lot the reading of papers in history falls ; 
but it is not likely that the demands on time and 
energy will prove greater than in other well-recog- 
nized admission subjects, and it is not unreason- 
able to expect college authorities to make suitable 
provision in these regards. 
The main element in entrance examinations in 
history must probably continue to be the writ- 
ten paper, but this should be set with the idea 
of testing to some extent the candidate’s ability 
to use historical material, as well as his know- 
ledge of important facts. The information ques- 
tions should not demand the simple reproduction 
of the statement of the text, but should in large 
measure be so framed as to require the grouping of 
facts in a different form from that followed in the 
books recommended for preparation. There should 
also be questions involving some power of discrimi- 
nation and some use of legitimate coriparison on 
the part of the candidate. It is not to be expected 
that skill in utilizing historical material will be pres- 
ent in a high degree in the candidate for admission 
to college, but the student who has learned how to 
handle books and to extract information from them 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
Proper Tests 133 
in the course of his secondary studies has the right, 
and the ability, to make this knowledge count for 
something toward college entrance. As suitable 
tests we may suggest comment on carefully chosen 
brief extracts from simple sources or modern works, 
analysis or discussion of more extended passages, 
supplemented perhaps by outline maps or concrete 
illustrations, — anything, in short, that will show 
the student’s capacity of taking up a fresh ques- 
tion in a way that indicates some development of 
the historical sense. Naturally, attainments in this 
direction will be expected chiefly of those who pre- 
sent history as an additional option. 
Doubtless to many these tests will appear suffi- 
cient; but it must always be borne in mind that a 
written paper, even when the questions have been 
prepared with great care, cannot yield such deci- 
sive results in history as it can, for example, in a 
subject like English composition. The examiner 
should always have an opportunity —and_ par- 
ticularly in doubtful cases — of supplementing by 
other means the information gained from the paper. 
One cxcellent adjunct is the submission by the can- 
didate of written work done in connection with his 
study of history in school. This may include note- 
books, abstracts of reading, and prepared papers, 
none of which, however, should be accepted with- 
out proper guarantees of authenticity and indepen-
-P-A-G-E-144
    134 Entrance Requirements 
dent preparation. Another supplementary test, 
which is largely used in European examinations 
and has commended itself to the experience of 
many American examiners, consists of a brief oral 
conference with the candidate. This should be 
quite informal in character, and should aim to dis- 
cover, if possible, something concerning the person- 
ality of the candidate and the nature of his historical 
training, rather than to elicit brief answers to a few 
arbitrarily chosen questions.

  Appendix I 
The Present Condition of History 
in American Secondary Schools 
ArT the very outset of its work, the committee, 
believing that recommendations must proceed from 
a knowledge of the conditions and results in the 
schools, undertook to learn, so far as possible, what 
was actually being done by the secondary schools 
in the country in the subject of history. A circu- 
lar was accordingly prepared in elaborate form in 
the hope that the answers to the questions thus 
proposed would give the committee a basis of fact. 
These circulars were not sent broadcast: in each 
state, so far as passible, some person acquainted 
with the educational work of that state sent us a 
short list of typical schools, large, middle-sized, and 
small, public and private; and we thus made up a 
list of about three hundred schools which would 
reflect the conditions of the whole country. From 
most of the schools thus approached answers were 
137
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 American Schools 
received, perhaps two hundred and sixty in all. Of 
these, two hundred and ten were sufficiently full on 
most points to admit of some sort of tabulation 
from which general tendencies might be perceived. 
In going over the returns difficulties were en- 
countered. Notwithstanding the combined efforts 
of the committee, some of the questions were not 
so framed as to bring out precisely what was 
wanted. Accordingly, toward the end of the in- 
vestigation, a considerable number of the schools 
which had replied to the first circular were asked 
to send answers to a second much briefer and sim- 
pler set of questions, intended principally to make 
clear the practice and opinion of educators on 
the points that had proved the most difficult for 
the committee. A copy of this circular will be 
found at the end of this Appendix. 
As is usual in inquiries by correspondence, the 
returns. show more certainly what schools do not 
do than what they do; the negative evidence is 
convincing that the schools have a great variety of 
programmes and methods: but it is hard to be sure 
that any considerable number have the same sys- 
tem, or attach the same meaning to such terms as 
“collateral reading,” “topics,” “use of maps,” 
“note-books,” etc. The general inferences from the 
circulars, however, agree with the results of many 
personal conferences with teachers, by showing that
-P-A-G-E-149
  Inquiries 139 
a large number of schools set themselves earnestly 
to the task of teaching history ; that a large number 
make a sufficient time allowance to deserve good 
results; and that the general notions as to methods 
are on the same lines throughout the country. 
Such generalizations as the committee thinks it- 
self justified in making on question of details, 
from the returns to the two circulars, supplemented 
by its private information, may be briefly stated as 
follows : — 
Choice of Subjects 
The subjects in the order of their frequency are: 
(1) English and American history, taught in more 
than half the schools ; (2) “ General history,” taught 
in almost exactly half the schools; (3) Greek and 
Roman history, taught in about half the schools; 
(4) European history, taught in about one-third of 
the schools, the three forms — medizval, modern, 
and French history — being about equally common. 
In a very few schools the history of the state in 
which they are situated is a subject. The favorite 
topics are, therefore, English and American history, 
usually both taught in the same school; Greek and 
Roman history, usually both taught in the same 
school ; and some form of what is commonly called 
“ general history.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 American Schools 
On the subject of general history there appears 
to be wide divergence of practice as well as of 
opinion. In the Middle states, most of the schools 
reporting have a one-year course, as have also a 
considerable number in the West; in New Eng- 
land, preponderance of sentiment is against such 
acourse. In some cases the course takes the form 
of medizval history alone, in some cases that of 
French history as a groundwork, — the system rec- 
ommended by the Madison Conference; in most 
instances the course is apparently a general survey 
based on one peatagd. with little or no collateral 
reading or illustrative work. 
' Order of Subjects 
The committee has taken pains to ascertain the 
more common preferences as to the succession of 
historical subjects, and finds that in general four dif- 
ferent systems have been followed : (About “one: 
third of the schools follow the chronological method, 
taking up in succession ancient history, general his- 
tory, and modern history in some form, usually Eng- 
lish or American or both; that is, they use general 
history as a bridge between ancient times and our 
modern nations. ‘A much smaller number of 
schools, perha of the whole, pr e 
order — general, ancient, and modern ; that is, first
-P-A-G-E-151
Subjects 141 
of all a survey of the whole field, and then more de- 
tailed study, first of the ancient period, then of the 
modern. This method is apparently Jess common 
in New England than in the West. The third 
method begins with American, or sometimes with 
English history, and then takes general history, 
“bringing in ancient history last. About one-fifth | 
ae aco repartee cote vy eto, which is 
least common in the Middle states, and which would 
seem to be devised to bring ancient history into a 
place convenient for college examinations. A 
fourth method, which prevails in more thanwa_ 
Guarterof the schools, is that of beginning with 
American, following with ancient history, and end- 
ing with a general course; that is, they proceed 
from the particular to the general. 
To make the generalization in broader form: 
the returns from a body of schools most interested 
in the subject of history show that one-half prefer 
to begin high-school work with the history nearest 
to the pupils in experience, and then to take up 
wider choices, while one-third have the chrono- 
logical system, and the remainder begin with the 
general survey of the whole field. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
142 American Schools 
Separate College Course 
The report of the Committee of Ten bore very 
strongly against establishing courses in any one sub- 
ject for the benefit of only those pupils who expect 
to go to college; and that recommendation exactly 
coincides with the actual experience of the schools 
so far as the study of history is concerned. Three- 
fourths of them advocate, and probably practice, the 
system of having the same teaching for both classes 
of pupils. This generalization applies also to New 
England, although in that section there is a large 
number of special preparatory schools. 
Time Given to History 
One of the arguments frequently urged against 
insisting on a good secondary course in history is 
that there is no time for it. The committee, there- 
fore, has taken some trouble to ascertain the time 
allowance now made in various schools, asking in 
the second circular the specific question: ‘“‘ What is 
the maximum number of exercises in history in your 
whole curriculum (allowing forty weeks as a school 
year), open to a pupil who chooses that course which 
has most history in it?’? There seems no reason to 
doubt the sincerity and accuracy of the replies to 
this question, although the results are surprising. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  
Courses and Time 143 
Only one-seventh of the schools offer less than 
two hundred exercises in one or another of their 
curricula. Probably there are courses, as the clas- 
sical or the scientific, in which this maximum num- 
ber of exercises is not attainable by any one pupil, 
even although the facilities of the school permit 
the offering of detached parts of a good course. 
Three-fourths of the seventy schools scattered 
throughout the country which report on this ques- 
tion offer more than four hundred exercises, that is 
the equivalent of five exercises a week during two 
years. The Middle and Western states are rather 
more alive than New England to the importance 
of history; and some schools, both in the East and 
West allow as much as eight hundred exercises : it 
is therefore safe to assume that good secondary 
schools can so arrange their schedules as to make 
a proper time allowance for history. 
Text-Books 
Knowledge as to the actual methods pursued in 
schools is difficult to gain from written circulars be- 
cause so much depends upon the understanding and 
use of terms; but the experience of the members of 
the committee gained by association with second- 
ary teachers, and in many cases by actual personal 
knowledge of their work, supplements and corrects 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
    
144 American Schools 
such generalizations as may be made from the 
returns to our circulars. The text-books used are 
legion, and without mentioning titles it is the judg- 
ment of the committee that, although the old-fash- 
ioned and discarded books are now disappearing, 
the favorite text-books seem still to be the briefer 
ones. Few schools appear to select a book with a 
good round amount of reading matter; hence, un- 
less supplemented by other work, the text-books 
used are likely to furnish an insufficient mental 
pabulum. Some specific information has been ob- 
tained about the opinion of selected teachers as to 
the wisdom of using more than one kind of text- 
book in the same class. Opinion seems about 
evenly divided, with a preponderance against the 
practice. 
Collateral Reading 
On the question of supplementing text-books with 
additional reading of some sort there seems little dif- 
ference of opinion: only one principal known to the 
committee advocates the extensive use of the text- 
book with little or no additional work ; about one- 
half the selected principals favor a large amount 
of collateral reading; the other half prefer more 
searching text-book work and less reading. In 
view of this very distinct preference, it is surpris- 
ing to find how few of the schools really seem fitted.
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  Books; Written Work 145 
out with good collections of standard secondary 
writers, suitable either for reading or for written 
work. Even schools with considerable libraries 
appear unable to keep up with the new general 
books, which would be so useful to pupils. 
Perhaps this lack of material accounts for the 
facts that very few schools (most of them in the 
Middle states) actually require as many as three 
hundred pages of collateral reading in connection 
with a course of five hours per week for a year, and 
that three-fourths of the schools have no specified 
requirements. Apparently pupils are invited to 
browse, but there is no system of enforcing the 
reading. Perhaps some of these schools may, with- 
out specifying a fixed number of pages, require 
results which may be gained from any one of sev- 
eral books; but it seems a fair inference from the 
replies, that as yet the schools have not fully intro- 
duced the system of collateral reading, and that 
many of them have not the necessary library. 
Written Work 
From the replies received, written work seems to 
be reasonably well established ; very few schools re- 
port that they require none. In most cases this work 
makes up less than one-third of the time spent by the 
pupils in acourse. A great variety of written exer- 
L
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 American Schools 
cises are in use, and the schools seem eager to further 
the method ; but in many schools it appears not to be 
a very exacting part of the historical work. Many 
teachers are struck with the effect of written work 
in training the memory and the powers of selection 
and in developing a capacity for individual thought. 
They see also that accuracy of arrangement and 
the power of analysis are induced, as well as an 
acquaintance with the material, and an ability to 
learn facts and to state them cogently. The criti- 
cisms most often passed upon such work are three: 
that it runs to routine and copying; that it con- 
sumes too much time; and that “it kills off good 
teachers.” It appears, however, that these disad- 
vantages have not been sufficient to cause the giv- 
ing up of the system, which in a considerable body 
of schools is now fairly established. 
Use of Sources 
The reports of more than sixty principals on the 
subject of using historical sources either as collat- 
eral reading or as material for written work, show 
that this system has little hold in the Middle states, 
much in New England, and some in the West. 
Nearly half the principals do not favor it, and some 
who like it have not sufficient books. The objec- 
tions appear to be: first, that it is a time-consuming
-P-A-G-E-157
    Sources; Teachers 147 
method ; second, that it throws upon the pupils an 
undue responsibility beyond their years and under- 
standing; and third, that it is “an attempt to foist 
upon the preparatory student the work of the uni- 
versity specialist.” The arguments used in favor of 
the method are, that it teaches the habit of getting 
at the bottom of a question ; that it induces methods 
of correct note-taking and record; that it trains 
individual judgment; and that it “vitalizes” his- 
tory and leads to greater interest and zeal. From 
the replies it seems doubtful whether all the teach- 
ers know what is meant by “sources,” or under- 
stand where to stop in using them in connection 
with busy school work. 
Teachers 
One question asked of the selected principals 
was: “ Are your teachers of history especially pre- 
pared for that work, as your teachers of languages 
or science are expected to be prepared?” To this 
question one-fourth frankly answered that they had 
no teachers of history who had been especially pre- 
pared. About another fourth put part of their his- 
tory work into the hands of untrained teachers. 
Something more than half give no work except to 
those who have special preparation. The Middle 
and Western states have in this respect a great
-P-A-G-E-158
148 American Schools 
advantage over New England, where the idea that 
none but persons who know history can teach his- 
tory seems slow of infiltration. 
College Requirements 
It is not the function of this committee to make 
up a college entrance system, but rather to sug- 
gest a plan of study for the schools; and the 
committee has abstained from recommending any 
distinct system or method. As a means of col- 
lecting information it asked for the opinions of 
teachers as to a plan which has become known 
through the country. One of the specific ques- 
tions asked was therefore as to the state of mind 
toward “the recommendation of the New York 
Conference of 1896,” which was substantially as 
follows :— 
(2) Minimum time, two years, three exercises 
per week (or one year, five exercises per 
week). 
(4) A good text-book. 
(c) Collateral reading. 
(d) Written work (a note-book, to be certified 
by the teacher). 
(e) Presumably two subjects, as Greek and 
Roman, or English and American.  
-P-A-G-E-159
  
College Requirements 149 
This recommendation has the qualified, or slightly 
qualified, approval of a little more than half the 
principals replying; and seems to meet with little 
objection in New England, where various colleges 
have indeed adopted it. The criticisms are most 
numerous from the West, but about half the ob- 
jectors take exception only to the time require- 
ment; they urge that the colleges ought to require 
more subjects, or at least that the minimum time 
ought to be enlarged. Four persons object to the 
collateral reading — none from New England. To 
written work there is little or no specific objection. 
The most frequent criticism is as to the note-book 
requirement; on that point one-ninth of the answers 
protest. A small number object to the choice of 
subjects stated by the Conference. To sum up 
the returns on this question, the serious objections 
raised are not against a wider allowance of history, 
but against details, of which the note-book sugges- 
tion is the point most criticized. 
Summary 
In this attempt to state in a few words the 
practices and preferences of the three thousand 
secondary schools in the country, the committee 
has availed itself, first, of the experience of its 
gwn members, four of whom have been teachers
-P-A-G-E-160
  
  150 American Schools 
in secondary schools and all of whom have gained 
some familiarity with instruction in these subjects, 
whether as examiners, inspectors, or members of 
school boards; second, of the acquaintance of the 
members of the committee with teachers, schools, 
and conditions in the various parts of the country ; 
third, of answers to the circulars sent to schools, 
stated by educational authorities to be representa- 
tive, some of which are very large and strong, some 
smaller, and some weak. In the 260 schools re- 
plying out of this category, an attempt has been 
made to discover the practice in teaching history ; 
and a second inquiry has been sent out to a body 
of schools which from their answers to the first 
circulars seemed in a position to furnish repre- 
sentative information. If the committee has mis- 
judged what the schools are doing and may be 
expected to do, it has not been from lack of effort, 
or from preconceptions as to what the schools ought 
to do, but from the impossibility of generalizing 
where the practices of the schools are so varied. 
Circular 
It has not seemed necessary to reprint the first 
circular of inquiry ; but we add a copy of the second 
circular, since it was directed to the questions which 
in the course of the investigation seemed vital.

Summary 151 
My Dear Sir: Some time ago you were good 
enough, at the request of this Committee, to fill out 
a circular of inquiry as to the teaching of history 
in your school. We beg to thank you for your 
courtesy, and to express our sense of the helpful- 
ness of your answers. 
In attempting to collect the answers from vari- 
ous sources, and to arrive at a just estimate of 
what the schools are doing and can do, we need 
definite statements on a few points, in a form for 
comparison; and we therefore ask you to add to 
the obligation under which you have placed the 
Committee and all those interested in the proper 
teaching of history, by briefly stating your practice 
and your preferences with regard to the subjects 
mentioned below. 
The Committee will feel very grateful for sug- 
gestions of any difficulties which you foresee in 
the new methods which have recently been brought 
forward. We want to know both sides, so that 
we may make no recommendations which will not 
commend themselves to intelligent teachers. 
In order to be available, your answer should reach 
the Secretary of the Committee by December 17. 
Please answer on this sheet or otherwise, number- 
ing the answers in sequence. Your answer is not 
to be made public; and even the briefest replies 
will be much appreciated, if time presses.

Examples of Extended Courses 
On the next four pages are examples of courses 
of study actually carried out, which justify the con- 
fidence of the committee in long and continuous 
courses in history. The first (pp. 154-155) is the 
course of an Eastern high school; the second 
(pp. 156-157), of a Western high school. They 
are offered here as exhibits, showing how practical 
teachers in the secondary schools have arranged 
their programmes so as to give time for the sub- 
ject.

  Appendix II 
Study of History Below the 
Secondary School’ 
BY LUCY M. SALMON 
THE question of instruction in history in the 
grades below the high school is one that concerns 
the present condition of such instruction and also 
one of an ideal condition toward which it may be 
possible to work. An inquiry? in regard to history 
1 This report has been prepared by the writer while in Paris, 
and it has not received the benefit of criticism from the other mem- 
bers of the committee. The writer therefore desires to assume the 
personal responsibility of the recommendations included in it. 
2 The inquiry was addressed to the superintendents of public 
instruction, and the result was as follows : — 
States having a uniform course in history . = e Eee 
States having such a course in preparation . . sicegae 
States having no uniform course. ° . a - 10

-P-A-G-E-169
  Present Condition 159 
in the public schools of the different states leads 
to the conclusion that the instruction at present 
given in this subject leaves much to be desired. 
A superficial examination of the replies received 
shows that only one-half of the states have a 
uniform course in history and that even in those 
states having such a course adherence to it is 
sometimes optional with the schools. It is not 
possible to discuss here the advantages of uniform 
curricula within limited areas, but it may be noted 
that progress in education has invariably followed 
the adoption of such a uniform course, and that 
those nations that have uniformity to-day have, 
as a rule, the best systems of education. With 
two exceptions, the ten states of the Union that 
have no uniform course of instruction are among 
the most backward in America in all matters of 
public education. 
The second noteworthy fact is the absence in 
nearly all of the states of a clear and definite 
understanding of the place of history in the cur- 
riculum. History is generally taught “ because 
every one ought to know something of the history 
of his own country,” yet no explanation is given 
1 “No school in the commonwealth (Massachusetts) is required 
to pursue this course of study. Ido not know of any school that 
adheres to it in all its details.’ —F. A. HILL, Secretary of the State 
Board of Education.
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 “oe Schools 
for this assertion, and there is often no appreciation 
of the educational value of historical study. Any 
course of instruction leaves something to be 
desired if it does not show obvious reasons for its 
existence. 
The corresponding noteworthy fact is that, if 
a definite reason for the study of history is 
presented, it is the factitious one of patriotism.! 
The idea that the chief object in teaching history 
is to teach patriotism is so thoroughly ingrained, 
not only in America but in other countries,? that 
it is extremely difficult to combat it. Yet it must 
be evident that the patriotism thus advocated is 
more or less a spurious one, a patriotism that 
would seek to present distorted ideas of the past 
1“Kindle the fires of patriotism and feed them constantly.” 
— Nevada. 
‘Develop patriotism.” — Colorado. 
The object ‘tis to make our boys and girls true patriots.” — 
North Carolina. 
2In France the question was asked of the candidates for the 
modern baccalaureate, July, 1897, “ What purpose does the teach- 
ing of history serve ?” and eighty per cent answered, “to promote 
patriotism.” — Langlois and Seignobos, /ntroduction aux Etudes 
Historiques, 288, 289. 
The theories of the emperor of Germany are well known, and it 
is perhaps inevitable, in view of the long struggle of Germany for 
nationality, that the teaching of history in Germany should be more 
or less colored by a desire to emphasize the progress the empire 
has made in this direction. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
Patriotism 161 
with the idea of glorifying one country at the pos. 
sible expense of truth. If the facts of the Franco- 
Prussian war should be used both in France and 
in Germany to inculcate this kind of patriotism, 
diametrically opposite results would be reached ; 
if the American Revolution is to teach this patriot- 
ism both in England and in America, one nation 
or the other must be illogical; if the Northern 
and the Southern states of America should use the 
facts of the Civil War to promote either a national 
or a sectional patriotism of this character, those 
facts would have to be perverted. That the ulti- 
mate object of history, as of all sciences, is the 
search for truth, and that that search entails the 
responsibility of abiding by the results when 
found, is yet to be learned by many of our 
teachers of history. 
The present condition of instruction in history 
in the schools is open to criticism for another rea- 
son. The curriculum has in many cases not been 
the result of educational experience or a product 
of educational theory. This fact explains in large 
measure the prevailing desire to use history as a 
vehicle for teaching patriotism. It probably does 
not admit of question that the curriculum of the 
public schools must and should be enacted by the 
state legislatures, but it is equally true that behind 
these legislatures should be organized bodies of 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
162 Lower Schools 
competent advisers to whose decisions on educa- 
tional matters the state legislatures should give 
the weight of their authority rather than them- 
selves assume the initiative. 
Another result of the condition just mentioned 
is the tendency to attempt only the teaching of 
United States history. The makers of our pro- 
grammes have encouraged the public to believe 
that the history of the United States is the only 
history worth studying, in that it is as a rule the 
only history prescribed ; it is studied in the seventh 
grade from 1492 to 1789, and in the eighth grade 
from 1789 to the present; in at least eleven of the 
states the history of the state is also prescribed, 
and in only five does the curriculum contain any 
suggestion as to teaching the history of other 
countries. Their argument, in which much truth 
lies, is the double one of sentiment and of utility, 
—of sentiment because we should keep an un- 
broken connection with our past, of utility because 
citizenship should be based on an intelligent under- 
standing of past as well as of present political con- 
ditions. Yet there are grave objections to this 
exclusive study of the history of the United States. 
Such study must be first of all insufficient. It 
gives but a warped, narrow, circumscribed view of 
history, —it is history detached from its natural 
foundation — European history, it is history sus-
-P-A-G-E-173
United States History 163 
pended in mid-air, it is history that has no natural 
beginning apart from its connection with European 
history. It is indeed difficult to decide where the 
history of America should begin, —if with the 
period of discovery and exploration, then it is in 
reality European history; if with the period of 
colonization, then it is rather English history; if 
with the adoption of the Constitution, then it is the 
history of a youth after he has attained his major- 
ity but whose past is in oblivion. If it is true that 
the history of England is the only history studied 
in the elementary and the higher grade board 
schools of England, it is also true that the history 
of England is so intimately connected with that 
of the Continent that some knowledge of general 
European history must of necessity be acquired 
through this study of a limited field. Yet it is also 
true that the teaching of history in England is far 
inferior to that in Germany and in France, and no 
small element in this inferiority is the limitation of 
the course to the history of England. If the in- 
struction in history in France and in Germany is 
confessedly superior to that given in other coun- 
tries, it is in no small part due to the breadth of 
view gained through the careful study of the his- 
tory of other nations. The social unit, the political 
unit, the ecclesiastical unit, is constantly enlarg- 
ing, and the educational curriculum must widen its
-P-A-G-E-174
: | 
164 Lower Schools 
boundaries if it is to keep pace with the evolution 
in other directions. 
But difficult as it is to find substantial reasons 
for the exclusive study of United States history as 
a whole, it is still more difficult to find them for 
the study of the history of the individual states. 
This history, prescribed by at least eleven of the 
state legislatures, is an evidence of misdirected 
patriotism and also probably a result of the peda- 
gogical cry that swept the country a few years ago, 
“from the known to the unknown.” But the de- 
mand for state history rests on no substantial basis 
either historical or pedagogical. Every state in 
the Union has artificial boundary lines determined 
by provincial grants or by legislative acts accord- 
ing to parallels of latitude and longitude, and to 
attempt to endow these artificially created states 
with the attributes of organic states is to distort 
historicaltruth. It is equally true that the demand 
that a study should proceed “from the known to 
the unknown” may involve a fallacy, that what lies 
nearest may sometimes be most obscure, and what 
is remote in time or place be most easily under- 
stood. 
It must be understood that this criticism is not 
one of the study of American history, but of its 
exclusive study and of the reasons so often as- 
signed for this study. Any study of American
-P-A-G-E-175
  State History 165 
history must be worse than barren that demands 
the memorizing of a text-book, but that leaves a 
boy in ignorance as to what are the fundamental 
facts in American history; that insists upon de- 
tailed information in regard to the campaigns of 
the Revolutionary War, but that has implanted no 
notion of personal responsibility to the government 
established through that war. In many states 
where the foreign element is large, there is abso- 
lute ignorance of the nature of republican institu- 
tions. In others, where the native-born element 
predominates, there is often no appreciation either 
of the duties or of the privileges or of the oppor- 
tunities of citizenship. History as taught in either 
of these classes of states is open to the same criti- 
cism as is historical instruction in the European 
schools where the history of the past is taught 
without reference to the conditions of the present. 
These grave faults must be avoided in American 
schools by the insistence at all times upon the fact 
that “good citizenship must be the religion of the 
common schools.” + 
1 Much of this work of inculcating right ideas of personal re- 
sponsibility may be done incidentally in connection with other parts 
of the programme. Washington’s birthday, Lincoln’s birthday, 
Decoration Day, election day, general exercises, debating clubs, 
work in English, and a score of other occasions, present constant 
opportunity for giving incidental and yet serious information in 
regard to American affairs, and for awakening an interest in them.
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 Lower Schools 
Other defects in the study of history in the 
grades are apparent. The history of the United 
States is studied during the last two years of the 
grammar grade, when the boy or girl is from twelve 
to fourteen years old. This means that valuable 
time has been lost, that long before this age the 
interest of the child should have been awakened 
and held by the pictures of the past. Again there 
is little evidence to show that history is united 
either with geography or literature. In several of 
the states history is not begun until geography is 
finished, and in others history is absolutely divorced 
from the instruction in English. Text-books are 
used without collateral reading, and sometimes the 
subject is divided by administrations, sometimes by 
pages! In one state the work in history is given 
during the first three years in the form of stories, 
and the instructions published for the ensuing four 
years are, to repeat the previous stories. In an- 
other state civics alternates with physiology. In 
apparently but four of the states has there been 
any consultation whatever with competent advisers 
in historical instruction regarding the course in 
history to be prescribed for the grades. 
Examination therefore seems to show that the 
1In one state the text-book used during the eighth year is 
divided into ten parts of about thirty pages each, and one part is 
assigned for each month.
-P-A-G-E-177
Inferior Methods 167 
present condition of instruction in history in the 
grades below the high school is defective in that 
uniformity is so seldom found, that there is no 
definite, well-defined object in teaching history, 
that when an object is presented it is generally 
the factitious one of patriotism, that as a rule the 
course is not prescribed by experts either in history 
or in education, that only United States history 
and state history are taught, that history is not 
studied in connection with other subjects in the 
curriculum, that a slavish use is too often made of 
the text-book,! that a mechanical division of the 
subject matter by pages or by administrations is 
often adopted, and that all instruction in this sub- 
ject is deferred until so late in the course. 
No criticism of existing institutions is justified 
unless it carries with it a recommendation of 
changes that will possibly bring improvement. In 
addition to the study that has been made of what 
is actually done in some of the best American 
schools, a careful study has been made of the 
programmes of the work in history in the schools 
of England, France, and Germany, and many of 
1 In 1893, 82 schools in New Haven County, Connecticut, were 
asked, “Is the memoriter method used?” 37 schools answered 
“Yes,” 39, “No,” and 6, “In part.’ One teacher in another 
county was “not particular about the words of the text if the pupils 
gave words as good.”  
-P-A-G-E-178

these schools have been personally visited. It is 
believed that the following scheme of work in his- 
tory can not only be justified by appeal to educa- 
tional theory, but that it can also be defended as 
_practical inasmuch as it is already carried out 
either wholly or in part in many schools. 
Grade III. Stories from the “TIliad,” the 
“ Odyssey,” the “Aneid,” the Sagas, the “ Nibe- 
lungen Lied ;” the stories of King Arthur, Roland, 
Hiawatha.

nent in history : Greece, — Lycurgus, Solon, Darius,

These names are suggested, not as a final selec- 
tion to be rigorously adopted, but as indicating one 
way of arousing interest and of conveying histor- 
ical information at the age when ideas of time and 
place relations are only imperfectly developed, but 
when interest in individuals is keen and active. 
The list may be changed 7x Zoo, but the principle 
still be retained. 
The plan for these two years (Grade III. and 
Grade IV.) implies that the object is to arouse 
interest, that the method used is to be wholly the 
oral one, that the stories are to be united with 
lessons given in language and in geography, that 
the selection of myths and stories should aim to 
give universal rather than particular notions, and 
that the teacher should have a sufficient acquaint- 
ance with history and literature to be able to de- 
cide wisely concerning the selection to be made.

Grade VII. English History. 
Grade VIII. American History. 
The reasons for recommending the order of sub- 
jects to be taken up from Grade V. through Grade 
VIII., are the same as those given by the Chair- 
man of the Committee in the body of the Report, 
and need not be repeated here. 
The reasons for recommending the preliminary 
survey of European history before taking up the 
same period in the high school are that the under- 
lying principle is similar to one that is in success- 
ful operation in Germany, — educational principles 
discovered by one group of instructors and success- 
fully put into practice by them can be adapted to 
meet the needs of other groups of instructors with- 
out the necessity of rediscovery; that it gives a 
good basis for high-school work, since it follows the 
law “that one obtains knowledge by adding to the 
ideas which one already has, new ideas organically 
related to the old;”! that the substitution of a 
brief course in European history for a portion of 
the American history now taught will conduce to 
a better appreciation of the important facts in 
1 Above, p. 17.
-P-A-G-E-181
  
European History 171 
American history, and that as a result the pupil 
will have a better understanding of the history of 
America after one year of special study given to it 
than he now has after two years’ study without 
this preliminary acquaintance with European his- 
tory; that it gives an outlook into the world of 
history and of literature to those who cannot com- 
plete a high-school course, and thus gives them 
resources within themselves that must be of value 
in their future lives; that it would do something 
to make fruitful what is now too often a barren 
waste,—the curriculum of the primary and the 
grammar grades; that its adoption would do some- 
thing to raise the educational and professional 
qualifications of teachers, since the knowledge re- 
quired to carry it out would be more extensive 
than that demanded by the present curriculum ; 
that through it something would be done to unify 
the subjects in the curriculum, which is now too 
often vague and formless; that since many schools 
in America now have a course similar to the one 
here advocated, it is a practical one. 
The plan of work in history here presented is 
suggested, not as being absolutely ideal in itself, 
but as one that more nearly approximates that 
ideal than the one often found in the public schools ; 
it is suggested with full realization of the fact that 
it probably cannot be at once adopted iz extenso
-P-A-G-E-182
  172 Lower Schools 
by a single school; it is recommended because of 
the belief that it is better to have an ideal toward 
which to work than to remain content with unsat- 
isfactory conditions. 
1 Lack of space prevents the elaboration of the principles sug- 
gested in this report. A more detailed presentation of them may 
be found in articles on History in Elementary Schools and Unity

History in the German Gymnasia’ 
BY LUCY M. SALMON 
Tue paper is largely based on a personal visit 
extending over three months’ time and including 
32 gymnasia in 18 different places; in 23 of these 
gymnasia 70 classes in history were heard, having 
an aggregate attendance of about 1500 boys. It 
was the plan to select places differing widely in 
conditions, from small provincial towns to large 
commercial and educational centres, and also those 
representing quite diverse political and religious 
interests. In some cases all the gymnasia in the 
city were visited; in some the work in every class 
in history was seen; in others the same class was 
seen in several successive lessons in history; the 
work of one class was visited in history and in

other subjects, and also all of the classes in his- 
tory taught by one instructor; the same instructor 
was heard in other subjects as well, and different 
sections of the same class taught by different 
instructors — every possible combination was made 
as regards town, school, instructor, and class. This 
has been supplemented by a careful study of the 
school laws and programmes of the twenty-six 
states making up the German Empire, including 
those of the twelve provinces that form the King- 
dom of Prussia. Except for incurring the charge 
of generalizing from one particular, a visit to one 
school and the study of one programme would have 
sufficed. There are indeed variations in detail, but 
the fundamental principles in the arrangement of 
the work in history are the same—a uniformity 
that is especially noteworthy in view of the contrast 
it presents to our own system, or lack of system. 
The result of this study gives a composite photo- 
graph of the work in history in the schools for 
boys, which bears a striking likeness to each of the 
individual parts making up the photograph. 
The reign of Louis Philippe began without glory 
and ended without honor ; but for one thing it is 
entitled to the grateful remembrance, not alone of 
France, but of America as well. In 1831 M. 
Cousin, holding a government commission, visited 
the schools of Prussia, Saxony, and Frankfort,
-P-A-G-E-185
The Gymnasium 175 
and, on his return, published those celebrated re. 
ports which for the first time made the German 
system of education familiar in France and subse- 
quently in this country. From that time to the 
present our interest in German education has been 
a growing one. 
It has, however, been naturally the German 
universities whose organization Americans have 
studied — the German schools have less often been 
visited, and their place in the educational system is 
less clearly seen. Just what this part is, however, 
must be briefly recalled in order to understand the 
place in the curriculum occupied by history. 
The German gymnasium — whether the gymna- 
sium proper with its course based on the classics 
and mathematics, the vealgymnasium which omits 
Greek from its curriculum, or the oderrealschule 
which omits both Latin and Greek — the German 
school, whatever its variety, takes the boy when 
nine years old, and at eighteen sends him to the 
university, the higher technical schools, or into 
business life with a well-rounded symmetrical 
education. 
This symmetrical education is made possible 
through the careful construction of the school cur- 
riculum. The curriculum is a sacred thing, not 
lightly formed or to be tampered with when made, 
for into it goes the best trained and most expert
-P-A-G-E-186

educational service that the state can command. 
The curriculum in every state is the same in the 
same class of schools, and the uniformity among 
the twenty-six different state systems is far greater 
than among the forty-five states of America. It 
may or it may not be due to the conscious influence 
of Herbart, —in many places there is a positive 
disclaimer of all such influence,— but, whatever 
the cause, the result is everywhere a curriculum 
that gives a compact, articulated, organic system, in 
strong contrast to our own. The result may be in 
part attributed, in spite of disclaimers, to the influ- 
ence of Herbart, and in part to the fact that the 
Germans as individuals are less prone than the 
Americans to fly off on tangents of their own, and 
consequently have a capacity for working together 
that shows itself as strongly in educational as in 
municipal affairs. The curriculum is a unit ; it is 
complete in itself, but it represents, at the same 
time, one stage in the development of the educa- 
tional system. This fact must never be lost sight 
of, or the corresponding fact that the American 
programme of studies presents an absolute con- 
trast to the German Lehkrplan. The American pro- 
gramme is often regarded as a convenient vehicle 
for conveying the instruction desired by interested 
parties. Does a state legislature believe that the 
schools exist for the purpose of implanting pa-
-P-A-G-E-187
  Curriculum 177 
triotism, they are forthwith commanded to teach 
American history; if a group of business men 
believe that the schools should have a bread-and- 
butter aim, stenography and typewriting are made 
compulsory; if one branch of the Church con- 
siders that the schools exist for the purpose of 
teaching religion, the study of the catechism is 
demanded; if an association deems that it is the 
first duty of the schools to inculcate the principles 
advocated by that association, it asks for the study. 
of physiology with special reference to the inju- 
rious effects of alcoholic drinks. The American 
programme represents the idiosyncrasies of in- 
dividuals, not the wisdom of the many. It must 
therefore be seen that the place occupied by his- 
tory in the German gymuasia, unlike its place 
in the American schools, is given it because the 
most eminent educators of Germany have agreed 
upon the place it ought to have in the educational 
system. 
What, then, are the characteristic features of 
history instruction in Germany, especially those 
that differ from instruction in history in America? 
Dr. Holmes was wont to say that it was neces- 
sary to begin a boy’s education with the education 
of his grandfather. In a similar way, any dis- 
cussion of history in the German schools must 
begin with the German boy,—a boy much like 
N
-P-A-G-E-188
    
178 German Schools 
other boys, but living in a military atmosphere, 
where obedience is the first law of men, as order 
is heaven’s first law elsewhere, —a boy who, from 
his earliest recollections, is taught that every one 
obeys some one else, — “Children obey their par- 
ents, the wife obeys her husband, the husband 
obeys the king, the king obeys God,” —a boy who 
is taught respect for authority, but a boy who is 
also taught that self-control and self-knowledge 
are as much a part and an object of education 
as is the training of the mind. Until the boy is 
ready for the university, that is, until he is eigh- 
teen or nineteen years old, he is a minor; he is so 
regarded by his instructors and he so regards him- 
self. He is under a constant supervision that, to 
an American boy, would be intolerable; he is in 
the gymnasium to be taught, and it is not expected 
that, before leaving the gymnasium, he should ex- 
press his personal opinion on any subject under 
consideration.1_ Instruction thus seems to be freed 
from some of the questions of discipline that ac- 
company instruction here, and the instructor is 
1 The director of one gymnasium said, “Our boys are not en- 
couraged to speculate about what historians themselves do not 
know.” Another remarked, “It is inconceivable that boys in the 
gymnasium should discuss political questions about which mature 
men disagree.” I did not hear a boy asked his opinion on any 
subject in the classroom, or a single boy ask a question ; everything 
was apparently given and accepted on authority.
-P-A-G-E-189
  
Discipline 179 
unhampered by the apparent necessity of sacri- 
ficing legitimate drill to the immediate object of 
maintaining a specious interest. 
The German instructor thus finds at hand a 
military system that is of help in the method of 
instruction, and he also finds a programme of 
studies arranged by expert educators and un- 
affected by political or religious considerations ; a 
programme the key-note of which is concentration 
— concentration of work, concentration of thought, 
concentration of time. 
The part, then, that history plays in the curricu- 
lum is not an independent one, but one correlated 
with other subjects. Yet the place that each 
subject has in this articulated system is clearly 
understood and defined. In historical instruction, 
according to the educational laws of Saxony, a 
knowledge of the epoch-making events in the 
history of the world, and of their mutual relation, 
origin, and development is to be specially sought. 
The Prussian programme of 1882 states the object 
to be “to arouse in the pupils respect for the moral 
greatness of men and nations, to make them con- 
scious of their own imperfect insight, and to 
give them the ability to read understandingly the 
greatest historical classics.” This position Prussia 
has modified by the programme of 1892 into one 
involving special emphasis on the development of 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 German Schools 
Prussia’s greatness and the centring of the new 
national life about her; but her former position is 
the one rather held by the other German states. 
History is thus to be an organic part of the 
school curriculum, but it is also to have a distinct 
definite aim of its own. That aim is to be the 
placing of high ideals before the boy, the develop- 
ment of his moral character through the study of 
these ideals; it is to be a part of “liberal culture 
and is to serve as a means of intellectual train- 
ing.” 
The work in history, in the gymnasium itself, 
must be considered under the two heads — subject- 
matter and method. 
As regards subject-matter, the nine years may 
be divided into three groups, the first group com- 
prising the first two years, the second the follow- 
ing four years, and the third the last three years. 
During the first two years, the boy, then nine or 
ten years old, is given the legends from classical 
and German mythology. The next four years form 
a second group. The boy, during this period, is 
from eleven to fourteen years old, and he begins a 
systematic study of Greek and Roman history, fol- 
lowed by a study of mediaeval and modern history, 
often with special reference to the history of Ger- 
many. The last three, when the boy is from fifteen 
to eighteen years old, form the third group; and,
-P-A-G-E-191
  
Subjects 181 
in this group, he has a second course in classical, 
medizval, and modern history. 
This, then, gives us the three concentric circles 
of historical instruction of Germany. During the 
first circle of two years no attempt is made to give 
formal instruction in chronological sequence; the 
work is introductory to that of the subsequent 
course, and it is intended by it to bring before the 
imagination of the boy in a series of vivid pictures 
the deeds of great heroes, to fill his thoughts with 
them, and thus to lay the foundation for the later 
more connected historical instruction.? 
This systematic instruction begins with the third 
year in the gymnasium, and during the remainder 
of his course, the work in history and geography 
forms the two regular concentric circles. The 
object in the first of these is to give a connected 
account of the origin and development of the great 
events in the world’s history, and especially of the 
relation of Germany to these events.2,- The work 
of the four years, therefore, begins at the begin- 
ning, and comprises a study for one year of Greek 
and Roman history, with the addition of the little 
necessarily pertaining to it from the history of the 
Oriental peoples. The next two years—that is,

-P-A-G-E-192
  182 German Schools 
the boy’s fourth and fifth years in school—are 
given to medieval and early modern history, but 
medizval history is treated as predominantly Ger- 
man, and the theory that the history of the Middle 
Ages is, in reality, a history of Germany, is com- 
monly accepted. With the close of the Middle 
Ages the point of view is changed somewhat, since 
modern history cannot be treated from the distinc- 
tively German standpoint, as can the previous 
period. But if modern history cannot be treated 
as world history, it is, at least, always regarded 
and treated from the European standpoint! Es- 
pecially during the last of the four years is the 
material handled from the general European, not 
from the special German or Prussian, point of 
view.2, During the second circle of systematic 
study, or the third circle if the introductory work 
is considered, the boy, at the age of fifteen, begins 
“the second wandering through the broad field of 
history,” but, with the object of laying the foun- 
dations deeper, of giving a broader outlook, of 
understanding present conditions through their 
development in the past, of building upon the love 
of the fatherland, that has been awakened in the 
earliest years, a sense of personal responsibility to 
it, of inspiring high ideals and creating ethical

standards.!_ Professor Jager has well pointed out? 
that every age has its special favorite ideas and 
prevailing interests, and that these necessarily 
affect the historical instruction in the higher 
schools.? To-day such interest is social and eco- 
nomic, and it is, therefore, to be expected that 
social and economic questions shall be treated with 
a certain partiality, and this is especially seen dur- 
ing the second review of historical events. 
What is the difference in the point of view in 
the three surveys of history? It may perhaps be 
said that, in the first circle, heroes, in the second, 
states — particularly the German state, in the third 
circle, the world, form the objective points. High 
ideals of action are the end sought in the first circle, 
aconnected account of the great events in the wor!d’s 
history that of the second, a knowledge of the civil- 
izing influences that have prevailed in the world’s 
history that of the third. If the centre of each

3 This is illustrated by the interest taken during the sixteenth 
and seventeenth centuries in dogmatic religious questions ; at the 
close of the eighteenth century, in literary and zesthetic subjects ; 
during the early part of the present century, the time of the pre- 
dominance of the Hegelian philosophy, in the philosophy of history. 
The history of each period shows more or less clearly the prevailing 
interests of the age when it was written.

circle is sometimes Germany, and if it is a part 
of the imperial theory that the radii of the circle 
should begin at the circumference and verge toward 
the centre, it is more often found in practice that 
the centre forms only a starting-point for the con- 
struction of the radii diverging to the circumfer- 
ence. Especially in German Switzerland is an 
appreciation found of the fact that it is unwise to 
distort history in order to magnify Switzerland or 
to foster an exaggerated patriotism. In Germany 
itself, while there is acquiescence in the imperial 
theory that the cultivation of the national spirit 
should be a special aim of historical instruction, 
there is also a recognition of the fact, as Professor 
Russell has pointed out, that the theory is peda- 
gogically shortsighted, “that patriotism should be 
more than mere enthusiasm, more enduring than 
the frothy exuberance of spirits that arises from 
the contemplation of great deeds; that love of 
country and of king depends upon a firm and 
unchangeable character.” 1 If Sedan Day is 
observed as an event marking a victory over a 
rival power, rather than as a day that means the 
unification of Germany, it is because that event is, 
as yet, necessarily regarded at short range; if the 
day is universally celebrated throughout the Ger- 
1 History and Geography in the Higher Schools of Germany, 
in The School Review, May, 1897.
-P-A-G-E-195
  Effect of the Circles 185 
man schools, it is because the consciousness is yet 
strong that it was the Prussian schoolmaster that 
won Alsace and Lorraine. That exalted patriotism 
that calls the whole world akin does not immedi- 
ately follow a triumphant national victory, but 
Germany will soon look at those events of German 
history that concern her immediate present in their 
true perspective. 
What has the boy gained as a result of this 
threefold division of subject-matter into concentric 
circles ? 
Compulsory education keeps him in school until 
he is fourteen years old, that is, until he has com- 
pleted the introductory work and the first circle of 
systematic study of history. If circumstances then 
compel him to leave the gymnasium, as forty per 
cent of German boys are obliged to do,! he has in 
hand such an outline of the great events in the 
world’s history as ought to save him from prema- 
ture or hasty judgments. But, if he completes the 
gymnasial course, he has gained not only this, but 
he has learned something of the deeper meaning 
of history. He has a knowledge of the art and 
literature of Greece that has rounded out his par- 
tial knowledge of these subjects gained through 
the Greek classics he has read; he understands 
the organization of the government of the Romans 
1 The School Review, October, 1897.
-P-A-G-E-196
    186 German Schools 
and what has been contributed to the civilization 
of the world by that eminentl, practical people; 
the Middle Ages are not, to him, dark ages, for he 
understands the place in that period occupied by 
the Holy Roman Empire; modern history means 
to him, not the unrelated history of Germany alone, 
but it means the study of new conditions made pos- 
sible through the discovery of America, and the 
industrial development of the fifteenth and six- 
teenth centuries; he compares the centralization 
of power under Louis XIV. with the low inorganic 
form of political life in Germany during the corre- 
sponding period, and learns the odds against which 
Germany has struggled in reaching her present po- 
sition. He has, from the time he was nine years 
old, had constantly put before him for nine years 
these developments, and has been made to realize 
“that mankind is an ethical whole.” The method 
has been called one of concentric circles, but is, 
rather, one of an ever-ascending spiral from the 
apex of which an outlook over the past is obtained. 
To change the figure, the three surveys are the 
three readings through which any legislative 
measure must pass before it becomes an act 
accomplished. As the three readings have given 
ample time for discussion, for sifting essentials 
from non-essentials, for presenting all possible 
arguments for and against a proposed measure,
-P-A-G-E-197
  Correlation 187 
so the three surveys must leave in the boy’s mind 
a residuum of all that is best in the world’s history, 
and this residuum becomes his abiding possession. 
The question naturally arises as to how far, in 
the selection of the subject-matter, the psycho- 
logical condition of the boy is considered, and how 
far both matter and treatment are adapted to this 
condition. It must have been inferred, from what 
has already been said, that this psychological con- 
dition has not only never been lost sight of, but 
that it has been made the basis of arrangement at 
every step of the way. “ The primary condition of 
historical perception is the readiness to think or to 
feel the past as present,” says Professor Jager.? 
This ability to feel the past, the development of 
the historical imagination, is the object of the 
instruction in the first part of the course. During 
the second division of the course, “the instruction 
as a whole,” says Professor Jager, “must give the 
boy forceful suggestions, strong impulses; must 
work from different sides for the one end of giving 
a check and a counterpoise to the distracting, self- 
willed, and disintegrating tendencies that beset this 
time of life.”? With the broadening out of the 
boy’s sympathies and interests he is brought, during 
the latter part of his course, face to face with those 
complex questions of present interest for the con- 
1 Geschichte, 9. 2 Tbid., 28.

  188 German Schools 
sideration of which there is needed a mind stored 
with knowledge, and the boy learns “a respect for 
knowledge for the knowledge’s own sake.” 1 
The importance that is attached to historical 
instruction is evident not only from the eare with 
which the course of study is planned, but from the 
time allotted to it. This is an average of three 
hours per week, including the time given geogra- 
phy, during the entire nine years’ course, a total of 
twenty-seven hours during the course, or one-ninth 
of the entire time throughout the’ course is given to 
these subjects.?

Time Allowance 189 
But it must not be inferred that the historical 
instruction the boy receives is confined to the 
three hours per week of formal instruction in this 
line. Extreme specialization has no place in a 
German gymnasium. Instead of each person im- 
agining that he has preémpted a portion, large or 
small, of the field of knowledge, and keeping jeal- 
ous watch lest some one else trespass on his pre- 
serves, each instructor seeks to bind his subject 
with every other. In the hours allotted to religion 
the boys read from the Greek New Testament; and 
Oriental history, as well as church history, is taught, 
though these are in the history classes proper. 
Herodotus and Livy are not regarded as mere 
vehicles for teaching Greek and Latin construction, 
but are taught as Greek and Roman history, and 
much of English and French history is taught 
through these languages. 
But even this correlation of history with every 
other subject is not all. One may study the pro- 
grammes and visit classes, and yet not understand 
or see clearly all of the influences at work that

It is thus seen that while the general average is 27 hours, 11 
gymnasia have 27 or more hours, while only 9 have less,
-P-A-G-E-200
  
190 German Schools 
make for history. Maps, charts, collections of 
pictures freely used; busts of all the authors read 
in the school; quotations from great men inscribed 
on the walls of classrooms; the memorizing of 
historical poems and passages from historical 
dramas; the observance of national and historic 
holidays; most of all, frequent excursions to points 
of historical interest, — all this is history, all these 
are influences that make history unconsciously 
grow into the boy and become a part of his very 
self. History is developed in him, he is developed 
through it. 
The subject of method of instruction must not 
be omitted, although it will demand but a brief 
consideration. 
The method is, in essence, the same throughout 
the course. In the first part it is story-telling, pure 
and simple; in the second part it is pure narra- 
tion ; in the third part it becomes more formal and 
resembles, somewhat, a college lecture. During 
the first of the hour the class is questioned on 
what has been narrated during the previous lesson ; 
then comes the narration of fresh material, and, 
with the younger boys, the hour is closed with 
questions on what has just been narrated. The 
theory is that the boy learns best from the living 
voice, that thus his interest is aroused and main- 
tained, and that history, in this way, becomes to
-P-A-G-E-201
  Methods IgI 
him a living, life-giving presence. The work of 
the teacher is supplemented by the use of a text: 
book (Leitfaden), but this contains only the barest 
outline of the events and is in no sense a text-book 
in the American usage of the term. The instruc- 
tor cannot expect that the boy will spend more 
than fifteen or twenty minutes in preparation of 
his history work, and, therefore, he is practically 
restricted to the use of the narrative method. It 
is the German theory that an excessive amount of 
outside study should not be demanded or given; 
that it is best for the boys to get as much edu- 
cation from each other as possible ; that, since one 
plans to become a lawyer, another a physician, 
a third a business man, and a fourth a teacher, 
each should talk over with the other his plans for 
the future, and thus become educated in ways not 
reached by the school. 
The narrative method does not lend itself easily, 
especially in the higher grades, to securing some of 
the best results that are secured in the best Ameri- 
can schools. It must seem to Americans to fail in 
developing the power of independent judgment, 
and to afford no opportunity for the exercise of 
that faculty known in the child as curiosity, and in 
the man as research. The boy absorbs and assimi- 
lates, but the creative faculty lies dormant. That 
this should be so, however, is a part of the German
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 German Schools 
theory of education. But the German method 
does secure certain admirable ends. On the posi- 
tive side it results in concentration of attention, 
alertness of mind, quickness of apprehension, and 
an enviable ability to grasp the salient features of 
a subject considered as a whole. The double and 
triple course gives constant opportunity for com- 
parison, especially during the last survey, and this 
basis for comparison and the constant advantage 
taken of it are one of the most valuable parts of 
the method. On its negative side the German 
method has the advantage that it leaves little room 
for crudity of opinion or for generalizations from 
insufficient data. 
The study of history in the German gymnasia 
thus shows seven distinctive features: first, the 
entire field of history is covered in three distinct 
surveys; second, the work in history is correlated 
with every other subject in the curriculum, and, in 
a sense, becomes its unifying force; third, ample 
time is given for its consideration, and it receives 
the same serious treatment as do other subjects in 
the course ; fourth, the division of material and the 
method of treatment are based on the boy’s psy- 
chological development; fifth, the narrative method 
of instruction gives the boy a vivid impression of 
reality of the past; sixth, the course is complete 
in itself, and, at the same time, it forms an ideal
-P-A-G-E-203
Advantages 193 
preparation for university work; seventh, every 
teacher of history is an absolute master of the sub- 
ject taught. 
What are the lessons to be learned by Ameri- 
cans from this examination of historical instruction 
in the German gymmnasia? 
The first great lesson we should all do well to 
heed is this: That the course in history serves the 
double purpose of being complete in itself and of 
being an ideal preparation for university work. 
The course is complete in itself; because, if the 
boy does not go beyond the gymnasium, or, if he 
leaves at the end of the sixth year in school, he 
has gained a wide outlook into the future because 
of this thorough study of the past; he has gained 
a proper historical perspective and he has learned 
that “hinter dem Gebirge sind auch Leute.” He 
has resources within himself that must contribute 
not only to the upbuilding of his own character, 
but that must redound to the advantage of the 
community in which his lot is cast. How great an 
advantage this broad outlook is can be seen by 
comparing the course in history in the gymnasia 
with that of the normal schools, where only Ger- 
man history is taught. One can but feel that the 
young men who are to be the teachers in the 
volksschule are losing much, that the volksschule 
are losing much through them, when the historical

horizon is bounded by Germany. Such minds 
must, in middle life, be stunted and dwarfed be- 
cause, in early years, they have lacked that mental 
and spiritual inspiration that the study of the 
largest life must give. Equally stunted and 
dwarfed must be the minds of our own American 
boys and girls when they leave school at the end 
of the grammar grade with a knowledge, insuf- 
ficient at best, of only American history. It must 
indeed be said that he who knows only American 
history does not at all know that history. “The 
profounder our study of ourselves,” says Professor 
Sloane, “the stronger will grow our conviction of 
the organic relation between our own history and 
that of the world.”#® American history is in the 
air, —a balloon sailing in mid heaven, — unless it 
is anchored fast to European history. It is no 
more true to say that American history begins in 
1492 than it is true to say that a man’s life begins 
when he goes into business for himself. English 
history does not begin with the reign of William 
III., or French history with the Third Republic, 
or German history with the establishment of the 
present Empire. A new stage of development in 
each country is marked by these events, and the 
development of Europe, on the New World soil, 
is but a corresponding one. America, like Europe,

is the heir of all the ages, and the American boy 
has the right to enter into his inheritance. The 
great demand in industrial life to-day is for such a 
change in methods of work as will have regard to 
the effects of work on the laborer rather than the 
results on the product. To the attainment of this 
end the work of William Morris and of John Rus- 
kin has been directed, and to the attainment of 
a similar end must the work of educators tend. 
How disastrous this restricted view of the past 
may be on our political, industrial, and educational 
growth is easily imagined when it is recalled that it 
was estimated, in 1886, that eighty per cent of the 
pupils in the public schools never reach the high 
school! Of those who pass through the high 
school, but a small proportion enter college. But 
it is not only possible, it is more than proba- 
ble, that even this small percentage who go 
through the high school, or through college, will 
complete their school or college life knowing noth- 
ing of historical conditions or developments. A 
man with this lack of preparation may enter Con- 
gress and legislate on financial matters in absolute 
ignorance of the history of finance; he legislates 
on labor questions with no knowledge of the agra- 
rian difficulties of Rome, the peasants’ rebellions

of the Middle Ages, or the national workshops of 
Louis Blanc. He legislates gold-standard educa- 
tors out of office at the West, and silver advocates 
out of office in the East, not knowing that, for 
four hundred years, Luther and the Wartburg 
have stood for independence of judgment and the 
search for truth. Not only is he lacking in the 
actual knowledge that history affords, but he lacks 
still more that mental training that history gives 
in analysis, comparison, classification; in holding 
the judgment in suspense until all sides of a ques- 
tion have been presented. The German boy is 
given both a body of facts and a mental training 
that ought to keep him from superficial judgments 
or hasty conclusions. 
But the special object of the German gymuasial 
course is to prepare for the university.1_ And here, 
in the case of the boy who enters the university, as 
in the case of the boy who does not, the German 
arrangement of historical work seems superior to 
our own. The university knows precisely what 
work in history has been done, and, therefore, it 
can assume this admirable preparation and shape 
its advanced courses accordingly. But the Ameri- 
can university or college makes its entrance require-

ment in history in deference to the antiquated idea 
that preparation in history should be the one that 
will most assist the study of Latin and Greek, and 
that every boy should know something of the his- 
tory of his own country. The boy, therefore, 
studies American history in the grammar grades, 
and Greek and Roman history in the high school, 
an arrangement of studies radically wrong, because 
false chronologically and false in principle. On 
such a basis it is impossible to build up a sys- 
tematic course of history in the college or the 
university without doing, in the college, a part of 
the work that should have been done before en- 
trance. “The larger universities,” says Professor 
Sloane, in speaking of American institutions, 
“have an imposing array of historical chairs, but 
they do not demand, as a condition of entrance to 
their lecture rooms, a thorough knowledge of gen- 
eral history.”! College students everywhere must 
feel the irrelevancy as well as the inadequacy of 
their work in history before entering college, when 
considered as a preparation for that college work. 
This conclusion must follow: The work in his- 
tory in American schools will never be on a rational 
basis until, as in Germany, it recognizes the double 
purpose that history in these schools is to serve ; 
until it is so organized as to give the boy or girl

who does not go to college a well-rounded concep- 
tion of the epoch-making events in the world’s 
history ; until it plans its college entrance require- 
ments in history with reference to the college work 
in history ; until it makes the course of history in 
the schools identical for those who do, and for 
those who do not, go to college; until it correlates 
the work done in history with the work of every 
other subject in the school curriculum.

Appendix IV 
History in French Lycées’ 
BY CHARLES H. HASKINS 
In France, as elsewhere, history is a compara- 
tively recent addition to the subjects of the sec- 
1 The following report does not profess to represent the results 
of a detailed examination of a considerable number of schools. 
The information upon which it is based has been gathered in the 
course of two visits to France, partly from official programmes and 
other printed sources, partly from observation of classes in lycées 
and courses for the training of teachers, and partly from conversa- 
tion with French professors who possess special familiarity with 
the conditions in secondary schools. I regret that the number of 
classes visited was not larger; but there is great uniformity of 
system and administration in French education, and I am informed 
by competent authority that wider observation would not have ma- 
terially modified the account here given. 
The official programmes and instructions are published by Dela- 
lain at Paris. The brief appendix on “The Secondary Teaching of 
History in France” in the Jntroduction to the Study of History 
of Langlois and Seignobos is excellent, and many of the suggestions 
will be found valuable outside of France as well. Altamira’s dis- 
cussion of history in secondary schools in his Ensefanza de la 
Historia (chapters 8 and 9) has much to say of France.

ondary curriculum. Long taught simply as an 
unimportant adjunct of the ancient languages, it 
is only in the course of the present century, and 
largely for the purpose of stimulating patriotism, 
that it has gained the right to an independent 
place in secondary schools. The desire to develop 
patriotic emotion by familiarity with the nation’s 
past still occupies in France, as in Germany, an 
important place in the minds of secondary teach- 
ers; but a broader conception of the aims of his- 
torical study has spread in recent years and found 
expression in the official instructions issued in 
connection with the course of study. History, 
they declare, contributes to the education of the 
mind by exercising the memory, developing the 
imagination, and training the judgment; it con- 
tributes to moral education by cultivating the love 
of truth and preparing youth for their civic duties. 
“To give the pupil an exact idea of the successive 
civilizations of the world and definite knowledge 
of the formation and growth of France; to show 
him the action of the world on our country and of 
our country on the world; to teach him to render 
to all peoples their just dues, to widen the horizon 
of his mind, and finally to leave him in possession, 
not only of an understanding of the present con- 
dition of his country and of the world, but also 
of a clear notion of his duties as a Frenchman

The School System 201 
and as a man—such is the function of history in 
education.” + 
The French system of public secondary instruc. 
tion comprises two types of schools: the lycées, 
schools maintained and directed by the cen- 
tral government, of which there are now about 
one hundred distributed throughout France; and 
the colleges, local high schools, which receive 
some assistance from the general treasury, and are 
usually less completely equipped than the lycées. 
For the purposes of the present report, however, 
the two institutions may be classed together, as 
the programme of studies isthe same in both. The 
regular course of the lycée covers ten years, but 
as the studies of the first three years are identical 
with those of the elementary schools, the pupil 
does not enter the Zycée proper until he arrives at 
the class of the szxzéme, where he begins Latin, if 
a classical student, or German, if he be a “mod- 
ern.” This stage is ordinarily reached at the age 
of eleven, so that the boy who spends seven years 
in the Zycée will complete the course and present 
himself for his bachelor’s examination at eighteen.

portion of these instructions which relates to history was prepared 
by Lavisse, and may be found, somewhat abridged, in his 4 yropos 
de nos écoles, 77-107. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
    202 French Lycées 
To state the matter in American terms, the French 
boy spends in the /ycée the period that the Amer- 
ican boy spends in the high school, plus the last 
year or two years of the grammar grade and the 
first year or two of college, but he reaches the close 
of his Jycée course about two years earlier than the 
American youth comes to the corresponding point 
in his education. + 
Throughout the whole course of the lycée, as 
well as in the three preliminary years, an hour and 
a half a week is devoted to history and an hour to 
the related subject of geography, except in the 
last year, where from two to four hours are given 
to history. The total number of hours varies from 
fifteen to twenty-two, according to year and course, 
decreasing in the later years of the classical course, 
but remaining undiminished in the modern, so that 
the proportion of time devoted to history, which is 
1 In what is said above, and in this account generally, the insti- 
tutions for boys are taken as the type. The secondary schools for 
girls have a course of five years, divided into two “ periods,” and 
history has an allotment of two hours a week throughout. In the 
first period, for pupils between twelve and fifteen, the programme 
covers the history of France, with “summary notions of general 
history.” In the second period a survey of the history of civilization 
is given. While in general the same methods of instruction prevail 
in both classes of schools, their application to girls’ schools is 
necessarily conditioned by the more general character of the 
course in history and the absence of classical studies from the 
curriculum.
-P-A-G-E-213
The Programme 203 
but seven and one-half per cent in the lower years, 
rises to twenty or even more in the last year. The 
total number of hours of history for the entire ten 
years is sixteen and one-half for classical and 
literary, and thirteen and one-half for scientific, 
students. In the elementary classes the historical 
instruction is necessarily of an informal character, 
and consists of biographical narration in the first 
year, followed by a two years’ survey of the history 
of France studied biographically. Then with the 
grammar division of the /ycée begins the systematic 
and continuous study of the world’s history. Three 
years are devoted to the history of the Orient, 
Greece, and Rome, and the remaining four years 
are occupied with the history of mediaeval and 
modern Europe, studied with special reference to 
France and divided into the following yearly blocks : 
375 to 1270, 1270 to 1610, 1610 to 1789, and 1789 
to the present. This is the programme for classical 
students. For the “modern” course, which is one 
year shorter, Oriental and Greek history are com- 
bined in one year, and in the last year additional 
instruction is offered in the general history of art 
and civilization, and in the elements of civil govern- 
ment and political economy. 
The most important feature of this programme 
is that it affords a comprehensive survey of the 
world’s history in its chronological development,
-P-A-G-E-214
  204 French Lycées 
from the earliest period down to the present. In 
contrast to the two “concentric circles” of the 
German gymnasium, the pupil is taken over the 
field but once, so that a fuller treatment is possible 
in any one year; but the thorough review of the 
German system is lost, much to the detriment of 
the subjects studied early in the course. In other 
respects the general distribution of time is much 
the same asin the Prussian programme, except that 
in the one case it is France, in the other Germany 
and Prussia, that forms the centre of study in 
medizval and modern times. The existing ar- 
rangement seems on the whole to be popular in 
France, though some prefer the German “circles,” 
and others demand for history, at some stage in the 
course, the preponderant place that rhetoric and 
philosophy now have in the last two years, urging 
that in no other way can the disciplinary value of 
history be realized, as a counterpoise to the formal 
studies of language and mathematics, and the only 
study which, by dealing with concrete social facts, 
brings the pupil into proper relations with his 
civic environment. 
Besides prescribing the general character of the 
course in history, the official programme contains 
an outline of the topics to be studied in each class, 
accompanied by brief suggestions as to the mode 
of treatment. The plan of each year’s work is
-P-A-G-E-215
  Methods 205 
drawn up with considerable care, but it is designed 
to serve as a guide to the teacher rather than nar 
rowly to control him. 
While there has been a noticeable improvement 
in the course of study in history since the middle 
of the century, the methods of instruction are still 
largely tinged with the spirit of formalism and rou- 
tine inherited from the Second Empire. The lycée 
is still a semi-military institution, which has much 
of the appearance of barracks, and calls its pupils 
to class by the beating of a drum; and while pro- 
fessors are now free to dress and wear their beards 
as they choose, they have not all grasped the full 
consequences of the idea that the pupil is to be 
trained as a citizen and not as a subject. Indeed, 
pedagogical problems in general have received com- 
paratively slight attention in France, and questions 
of what to teach and how to teach in history have 
been very little considered. A common practice is 
to dictate a brief summary of the hour’s work, ex- 
pand this into a lecture while the pupils take notes, 
and question them at the beginning of the next 
hour on the lecture and some pages of the text- 
book. The professor speaks from a raised plat- 
form, and the small blackboard is reserved for his 
personal use only. The scholars usually show in- 
terest, and they may be even required to prepare 
supplementary papers, but their attitude is largely
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 French Lycées 
passive, and the system lacks the advantages of 
the steady German drill on hard facts, or the freer 
use of material characteristic of good American 
teaching. These conditions are, however, begin- 
ning to pass away as the professors who have 
grown old under the dictation system give place 
to younger men. It is coming to be realized that 
the pupil should get his fundamental facts from 
a text rather than from the instructor’s lecture, 
and that the time spent in the classroom need not 
be wholly given up to the alternate repetition of 
statements by teacher and pupil. In addition to 
the text-book, classes may now have at their dis- 
posal excellent illustrative matter, such as is con- 
tained in the Albums historigues of the Middle 
Ages, edited by Parmentier, and the Lectures his- 
toriques 1 designed for supplementary reading. In 
one way and another fresh life is being infused 
into the study of history, and in some schools re- 
markable results have already been attained in 
1 These are published by Hachette. The three volumes for the 
ancient period consist of an interesting series of sketches of Egyp- 
tian and Assyrian life from the competent hand of Maspero, and 
excellent accounts of the public and private life of the Greeks and 
Romans by Guiraud. The later volumes are made up of well- 
chosen selections from modern historians, grouped according to 
the programme. The extracts from sources contained in the earlier 
editions have now been omitted, as they did not seem adapted to 
this stage of the pupil’s development.
-P-A-G-E-217
  Preparation of Teachers 207 
securing the pupils’ active participation in the 
work,! 
The professors of history and geography in 
lycées —the subjects are usually combined — are 
appointed on the basis of a competitive examina- 
tion. After having taken his baccalaureate degree 
the candidate must continue his work for two 
years, studying Latin, Greek, and French, as well 
as his specialty, until he receives the /icence. Then 
comes a further year spent largely in the writing 
of a thesis, followed by a year’s strenuous prepa- 
ration for the final test, the agrégation, for which 
the competition is very keen. As the examination 
bears upon the candidate’s ability to present a sub- 
ject before classes, as well as upon his knowledge 
of history and geography, the preliminary courses 
include, not only lectures and seminaries, but 
numerous practical exercises in teaching, under 
the supervision and criticism of professors and 
fellow-students. The necessary preparation of a 
teacher of history accordingly consists of a sub- 
stantial classical education as a foundation, and a 
period of special study of at least four years spent 
at one of the universities or at the Ecole Normale

Supérieure, the whole tested by a rigid examina- 
tion. 
Such, in brief outline, are the general features 
of historical instruction in the secondary schools 
of France. The French have realized the impor- 
tance of history as an essential element in the sec- 
ondary curriculum, they have made provision for 
its systematic and continuous study throughout 
the whole of the school course, and they have 
established a system which assures the selection of 
well-trained teachers. In these respects we can 
profit by their example; but at present we have 
little to learn from their methods of instruction, 
beyond the suggestions that may be derived from 
their clear and well-ordered text-books,! and from 
the arrangement of topics in the programme, which 
Matthew Arnold declared no educated man could 
read “without profit— without being reminded 
of gaps in his knowledge and stimulated to fill

has gone out of use, and the famous school histories of Duruy are 
passing. A scholarly series is appearing under the editorship of 
Monod ; the volume by Bémont and Monod on the Middle Ages 
is excellent, though somewhat beyond the grasp of the boys of four- 
teen for whom it was written. The text books of Seignobos on the 
Orient, Greece, and Rome, published by Colin, are very suggestive, 
and deserve to be better known in America ; see particularly the 
Suppléiments & l’usage des professeurs issued in connection with the 
volumes on the Orient and Greece.

them.” ! We must, however, remember that it is 
only in recent years that historical studies, even in 
the universities, have been placed upon a sub- 
stantial basis in France, so that it is too soon to 
expect the best results in secondary teaching. 
Already there are indications that as the possibili- 
ties of historical instruction become more gen- 
erally recognized, and the improvements in higher 
education make themselves more widely felt in the 
schools, it may be well worth the while of Ameri- 
can teachers to watch the progress of historical 
teaching in France; for in spite of all the differ- 
ences in conditions in the two countries, the 
fundamental problem of the secondary teacher of 
history is the same in France as in America, 
namely, how to make the study of history tell most 
effectively for the general culture and the civic 
training of the future citizens of a great democ- 
racy. In solving this problem we shall need all 
the experience of both sides of the Atlantic.

    Appendix V 
History in English Secondary 
Schools 
BY GEORGE L. FOX 
THE well-known chaotic character of the English 
system of education makes it difficult to give a 
satisfactory account of the scope and methods of 
teaching history in English secondary schools. 
There is great lack of system and uniformity of 
method. In France and Germany, order and 
symmetry prevail in the educational system, as it 
is controlled and determined by the state. A rea- 
sonable uniformity therefore results, and whatever 
assertions can be safely made about a few repre- 
sentative schools are likely to be true of most of 
the schools. In England, on the contrary, the 
secondary schools are almost entirely under pri- 
vate control, and are generally free from state 
supervision. Indeed, the secondary school sup- 
ported wholly or partly by public taxation, and 
210
-P-A-G-E-221

under the control of the state and local govern. 
ments, like the high school in the United States, 
or the /ycée in France or the gymnasium in Ger- 
many, does not exist in Great Britain, although 
some secondary school subjects are taught in the 
higher grade board school, and the evening con- 
tinuation schools. 
When English secondary schools are discussed 
in this report, the expression is to be understood as 
referring chiefly to the so-called public schools of 
England, of which Winchester, Eton, Harrow, and 
Rugby, are the familiar type. These institutions 
are, in most cases, endowed schools, controlled by 
a board of governors, in which the course of study 
and the methods of teaching are determined by the 
head-master. The pupils, when they enter these 
schools, are usually between twelve and sixteen 
years of age, and they have received their previous 
education either from private tutors, in local gram- 
mar schools or, more commonly, in small boarding 
schools, scattered over England, called prepara- 
tory schools, which are private venture-schools, that 
is, are owned by private individuals. In these 
schools they have usually studied elementary Eng- 
lish history, and to some degree, Greek and Roman 
history as well. 
There is another reason also, why it is not easy 
to give an exact account of the teaching of history
-P-A-G-E-222
  212 English Schools 
in the English secondary schools, namely, because 
of the difficulty which the visitor has in seeing the 
teacher actually at work in his classroom. The 
visitor to French or German schools, if he has 
the proper authorization from the state authority, 
finds at once ready entrance to every classroom. 
But no such “ open sesame” makes easy the path- 
way of the visitor to the English secondary schools. 
There seems to be an unwritten law that an Eng- 
lish master’s form-room is his castle, and it is not 
an easy thing to see the actual work of teaching. 
The writer of this report saw less than a dozen 
recitations in history in English schools, and the 
statements which are made are based on such 
limited inspection, the perusal of courses of study 
and examination papers, and on conversation with 
different teachers of history. 
While the course of study and the methods are 
largely determined by the head-master, he is limited 
in his decisions by the requirements of the higher 
educational institutions, for which most of the 
pupils are preparing. 
The English public school is commonly divided 
into two departments: the classical side and the 
modern side, which correspond, roughly, to the 
classical and scientific courses in our schools. 
The ultimate aim of the boy on the classical side 
is entrance to the universities of Oxford or Cam-
-P-A-G-E-223
  University Influence 213 
bridge. The goal of the boy on the modern side 
cannot be so definitely stated ; but it is either busi- 
ness life, the engineering and scientific professions, 
or the army colleges. This last class, who intend 
to be officers in the army, are a considerable pro- 
portion of the boys on the modern side, and their 
needs are especially recognized by a subdivision in 
the later years of this course, called “The army 
class.” The limitations, which are likely to gov- 
ern the course of study of the army class, are the 
requirements imposed by the government for ad- 
mission to the military colleges of Woolwich and 
Sandhurst, one of which educates officers for the 
artillery and engineering, the other for the infan- 
try and cavalry branches of the service. Among 
these requirements, English history finds a place 
only as an optional subject, for which the maxi- 
mum allowance is two thousand marks in a total of 
fourteen thousand. 
While in the secondary schools of England the 
State has no direct influence in determining the 
course of study, the influence of the universities 
in this respect is most important and effective. 
This influence is most directly exerted through 
what is known as the Oxford and Cambridge 
Schools Examination Board, which is made up of 
representatives of both universities. 
This board conducts examinations at the close
-P-A-G-E-224
214 English Schools 
of the school year at most of the leading schools in 
England, and issues certificates of proficiency to 
those who have successfully passed the examina- 
tions. These higher certificates give exemption, 
under certain conditions, from the earlier examina- 
tions in the university course, known as “ Smalls” 
at Oxford, and “The Little Go” at Cambridge. 
The subjects of the examination are classified in 
four groups: (1) a language group, including four 
subjects, Greek, Latin, French, German; (2) a 
mathematics group divided into two subjects; 
(3) an English group divided into scripture know- 
ledge, English, and history, and (4) a science group 
divided into six subjects. 
Candidates are usually required to pass in four 
subjects in not less than three groups. If they offer 
history, they may choose between Greek, Roman, 
and English history. The whole field of each 
country’s history is not necessarily included. Often 
a period covering less than three centuries is pre- 
scribed, together with a special knowledge of a 
smaller period included within it. 
In 1897 the general period in Greek history ex- 
tended to 323 B.c., while the special period extended 
from 403 B.c. to 362 B.c. In Roman history the 
general period was from 72 B.c. to 180 A.D., while 
special knowledge was required of the period from 
14 A.D. to 96.4.D. In English history the exami-
-P-A-G-E-225
  University Examinations 215 
nation covered from 1485 to 1660, with a special 
knowledge of the period from 1555 to 1603. 
These specific instructions as to periods to be 
studied are changed every two or three years, but 
seldom is a period of English history prescribed 
later than 1815. The two points to be noted in 
these requirements are, first, that the shorter period 
for study is included in the longer period, and 
second, that in each subject the examination covers 
only a portion of the nation’s history. 
The colleges, at both the universities of Oxford 
and Cambridge, also endeavor to strengthen the 
instruction of history at the schools by establishing 
history scholarships, which yield from $250 to 
$400 a year to the successful candidates. These 
scholarships are offered either by single colleges 
or by two or three colleges combined. As is well 
known, this is a method characteristic of the Eng- 
lish universities for promoting interest in any 
branch of learning, and serves to introduce into 
the schools a tendency to have a promising pupil 
in the upper classes specialize upon some subject 
for which he has a strong bent. The two most 
prominent of the Oxford colleges in awarding his- 
tory scholarships are Balliol and New College, who 
hold the same examination for this purpose. 
The examinations for this purpose held on Nov. 
16, 1897, consisted of (1) an essay written in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
    
216 English Schools 
examination on some historical subject, (2) two 
language papers showing candidate’s knowledge 
of Latin, Greek, French, or German, (3) a general 
paper, (4) two papers either in ancient history or 
in medieval history (including English history), 
or in the history of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and 
eighteenth centuries (including English history), 
at the option of the candidate. The regulations 
prescribed that the knowledge required for the 
general paper could be obtained from such books 
as the following: Guizot’s “Civilization in Europe,” 
Hallam’s “Middle Ages” (Chapter IX.), Bagehot’s 
“English Constitution,” Maine’s “Ancient Law,” 
Macaulay’s “ Essays,” and Walker’s “ Political 
Economy.” These books, naturally, a successful 
candidate would be expected to have read thor- 
oughly, although one of the Balliol examiners told 
me that it was not wholly acquaintance with books, 
but signs of promise shown by the candidate, that 
determined the award. Most stress is laid upon 
the essay and general papers which test natural 
ability. The scholarships that are offered at Ox- 
ford are open to all candidates who have not been 
in residence at the university more than eight 
terms, or two years; so that a candidate fresh from 
a public school may have to compete for a scholar. 
ship with students who have been for more than a 
year at the university. But still a few boys in the
-P-A-G-E-227

highest forms of the best schools will usually be 
found in training for these scholarships. They 
will receive especial attention in history work from 
one of the masters, will be excused from some 
other subjects in order to give time to collateral 
reading, in which they are tested from time to time 
by the special master. 
The certificate examination and the scholarship 
examination illustrate the two classes of pupils 
whose wants are considered in the colleges and 
schools of England, viz. the average pupil and the 
pupil of unusual ability in any direction. Because 
of this distinction there exist, side by side, at the 
universities, the pass and the honor examinations. 
Of course the needs of the latter class are not con- 
sidered except in the higher forms of the school, 
but there they are very distinctly considered. 
Small classes of able pupils receive special instruc- 
tion to fit them for the scholarship contests in 
different subjects. The eagerness to win these 
scholarships and thus to gain distinction forms a 
powerful incentive to earnest and wide reading in 
history, although, in the opinion of some critics, 
the scholarship system is one of the baneful fea- 
tures of English education. These two classes of 
pupils must be borne in mind, in considering the 
teaching of history in English schools. 
With regard to the field of history that is covered
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 English Schools 
in the schools, the course of study in most schools 
includes, on the classical side at least, Greek history, 
Roman history, and English history. In most 
cases the pupils will give at least one hour a week 
to history throughout the course, from the age of 
twelve to nineteen. A boy who has passed through 
all the forms of the secondary school, will very 
likely have taken up these subjects twice; first in 
an elementary way with a brief text-book, such as 
Gardiner’s “Outline of English History,” or Ran- 
some’s smaller book. Then at a later stage of the 
course comes a more thorough treatment of the 
subject with a more extensive text-book, and pos- 
sibly collateral reading. 
Of course the chief object of the elementary 
course should be not only the learning of the main 
facts of history, but also an awakening of interest 
in the subject, which creates a thirst for individual 
study. Whether these ends are realized depends 
very much upon the character of the teaching and 
the enthusiasm of the teacher. 
Haileybury College in Hertfordshire, one of the 
youngest and less known public schools, has won 
especial distinction in this respect through two of 
the masters who are keenly interested in teaching 
the world’s life of the past. The lecture-room is 
fitted with all necessary appliances for using the 
stereopticon in the daytime. Thousands of slides
-P-A-G-E-229
Programmes 219 
have been made by these masters, from photo- 
graphs of places, costumes, relics, armor, weapons, 
etc., and authentic illustrations in books, such as 
those in Gardiner’s “ History of England,” or the 
illustrated edition of Green. Thus the imagina- 
tion of the boys is stimulated, and the past is made 
- to live before their eyes. 
Two dangers of this method they seem to have 
avoided at Haileybury. One is the disposition of 
a live boy “to take advantage of the darkness 
necessitated by the use of the lantern to riot or to 
sleep.” The other is to look upon the exercise 
as a pleasant diversion for the hour only, leav- 
ing no permanent absorption of knowledge in the 
pupil’s mind. At Haileybury the pupils are re- 
quired to hand in reports of the lectures, and their 
knowledge is tested by vzva voce questioning. The 
same method is utilized with the higher forms, 
where the history of the French Revolution is illus- 
trated with contemporary portraits and caricatures, 
thrown upon the screen. I doubt if in any school 
in the world so extensive and efficient use of the 
stereopticon in history teaching is made as at the 
old college of the East India Company, now a 
public school, where Malthus was a teacher, and 
John Lawrence fought many a battle with his fists. 
I have spoken of the limited fields of history 
prescribed by the Oxford and Cambridge certifi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 English Schools 
cate examinations, but the schools naturally do 
not limit their courses of study by these require- 
ments. In a number of them a prescribed cycle 
of history is laid down. This system is cham- 
pioned by some masters and condemned by others. 
As a specimen of such a cycle I will quote from 
the calendar for 1896, of Winchester College, the 
oldest public school in England, founded in 1387. 
The fall term at Winchester is known as the Short 
Half; the winter term as Common Time; and the 
term following Easter to August 1, as Cloister 
Time. Common Time and Cloister Time together 
form the Long Half. 
The highest class is known as the Sixth Book, 
for which there was this history cycle covering four 
years. 
Long Half. Hallam’s Middle Ages. 
Short Half. Greek History to 435 B.c. 
Long Half. The Reign of Henry VIII. 
Short Half. Roman History 133-31 B.c. 
Long Half. The Reign of Charles I. 
Short Half. Roman History 31 B.C.-305 A.D. 
Long Half. English History 1215-1327. 
Short Half. Bryce’s Holy Roman Empire. 
It is hard to make out much orderly sequence 
or deliberate teaching purpose in such an arrange- 
ment, and it would seem that a pupil following
-P-A-G-E-231
European History 221 
such an order would get a confused impression of 
the course of the world’s history. But probably, 
like many other things in the English school cur- 
riculum, it is a traditional growth and not founded 
on any distinct pedagogical purpose. 
Much easier to understand is the cycle for the 
other classes in the school as follows :— 
1896. 
Short Half. Greek History after 432 B.c. 
1897. 
Common Time. Roman History to 200 B.c. 
Cloister Time. Roman History after 200 B.c. 
Short Half. Student’s Gibbon to Justinian. 
1898. 
Common Time. Student's Gibbon from Mahomet. 
Cloister Time. English History, Tudor Period. 
Short Half. English History, Stuart Period. 
1899. 
Common Time. Greek History to 432 B.c. 
It has been said that the fields of history usually 
covered in the English public schools are Greek, 
Roman, and English history. It should be added 
that in many schools there is considerable teach- 
ing of Biblical history under the head of scripture 
knowledge, as well as the outline history of the 
English Church. 
European history, except where it is in close 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  
222 English Schools 
contact with English history, is not formally and 
generally recognized in the school curriculum. 
Occasionally a school will be found where the 
enthusiastic interest of a master has secured for 
his form some recognition of a particular period of 
European history apart from English history. To 
what extent this casual and incidental teaching of 
history goes on depends upon the enthusiastic zeal 
of the master and the disposition of the head-mas- 
ter to encourage or discourage it. In the year 
1893-94 the upper bench of the Sixth at Rugby 
took Seebohm’s “ Era of the Protestant Reforma- 
tion,’ and part of Oman’s “The Dark Ages.” 
Indeed, in this somewhat irregular way, the pupils 
learn considerable history outside of the stated and 
formal curriculum. The form masters in the higher 
forms on the classical side often lay stress upon 
the writings of Livy, Cicero, Tacitus, and Thu- 
cydides, as history as well as literature or philol- 
ogy. At Harrow, under Mr. Bowen, the master 
of the modern side, the books read are often 
distinctly of a historical character. Books like 
“Lazare Hoche,’ ‘Campagne de _ Russie,” 
“Charles XII.,” and Beresford-Webb’s “German 
Historical Reading Book,” are cases in point. 
They are studied not only from a language point 
of view, but also with regard to the study of 
history.
-P-A-G-E-233
English History 223 
This incidental teaching of history in some 
schools takes the place of practice in writing Greek 
or Latin verse, and is known as verse equivalent. 
In 1897, at Rugby, the boys of some of the forms 
who were excused from verse-making, were com- 
pelled to take as verse equivalent the three fol- 
lowing books: in the Lent term, Seeley’s “The 
Expansion of England”; in the summer term as 
appropriate to the Diamond Jubilee, McCarthy’s 
“Short History of Our Own Times,” and during 
the winter term, Bosworth-Smith’s “Rome and 
Carthage.” There is one exercise a week when 
the class is tested on its knowledge of about thirty 
pages of the text-book, with comment by the 
teacher, and at the end of the term an examination 
is held on the work which has been covered. At 
Eton, a similar system prevails under the name of 
“extras,” which, according to the syllabus, provides 
an interesting study of some historical and _politi- 
cal questions. 
With regard to English history, I found that 
comparatively little attention was paid to the his- 
tory of Great Britain during the present century, 
or to speak more accurately, since the passing of 
the Reform Bill in 1832. This is unfortunate and 
is hardly in accord with the Jubilee spirit in 1897, 
which gloried in the Victorian era. 
Verily, the social and constitutional progress of 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  224 English Schools 
England during the present century, makes it one 
of its most interesting and important epochs, espe- 
cially with regard to colonial expansion and social 
betterment. Yet the pupil at the English second- 
ary school does not receive much instruction in 
this important era of the nation. None of the Ox- 
ford and Cambridge examination papers, that I 
have examined since 1890, specify any period of 
English history later than 1815. The same is true 
of the examination papers of a number of schools, 
in which little was found touching upon the Victo- 
rian era, save in the case of Malvern and Clifton, 
two of the new schools. When I asked for an 
explanation of this fact, one reply given was that a 
careful study of the period would rake up burning 
questions, on which family and inherited prejudices 
were very strong. For this reason it was thought 
best to avoid anything that would lead to wran- 
gling disputation. 
Possibly it may be due to the same insufficient 
reason that the study of what is called in this 
country, civil government, is almost entirely neg- 
lected in English secondary schools. It is not 
mentioned in their courses of study, and the only 
school, in which I found it pursued as an indepen- 
dent study, was Haileybury, where a small class 
was taught by one of the teachers of history 
already mentioned, who was using with his form
-P-A-G-E-235
     Civil Government 225 
Miss Buckland’s little primer, “Our National In- 
stitutions.” This seems to be a very serious defect 
of the secondary school course in England, as com- 
pared with Germany, France, or the United States. 
In support of this statement I would quote from a 
striking address on!“ The Teaching of Civic Duty,” 
by an Englishman, for whom citizens of the United 
States have a high regard, the Hon. James Bryce. 
“Boys leave our so-called secondary schools at 
sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen, leave even some 
of the greatest and most costly schools in the 
country, having received no regular instruction in 
the principles and working of the British consti- 
tution, much less in their own system of local 
government, wherein many of them as local mag- 
nates are soon called upon to take part.” Professor 
Bryce’s noble plea was delivered to an audience of 
elementary schoolmasters, but it is a trumpet call 
to public schoolmasters as well as to the audience 
before which it was spoken. The admirable sylla- 
bus on “The Life and Duties of the Citizen,” 
which is prescribed by the National Educational 
Department in the Evening Continuation School 
Code, might well be followed in the great public 
schools.

  226 English Schools 
history in most English schools, shows less con: 
sideration for the subject than in France or Ger- 
many. In few schools are more than two hours 
per week given to classroom work in history; but 
at least one hour a week is given to history in each 
year of the school course, which in the case of 
most public schools covers five or six years. The 
order of teaching the different periods of history 
varies very much, and as in the cycles from Win- 
chester, already quoted, seems not to have been 
arranged on any distinct pedagogical plan. 
The subordinate position of history in the school 
courses is indicated not only by the small time 
allotment, but also by the fact that not until re- 
cently was this subject taught by specialists, viz. 
by men that had been specially trained in the 
subject of history, and had devoted themselves 
very largely to teaching that subject. The spirit 
of the English secondary school is against special- 
ization in teaching, except in the case of science, 
modern languages, and mathematics. The form- 
master usually teaches Latin, Greek, Scripture, 
English, and history, while in the latter subject he 
may have had no special training. A welcome 
reform in this respect has already begun, which it 
is to be hoped will probably gain ground and im- 
prove the history teaching in the schools. Several 
of the larger schools have now on their staff his-
-P-A-G-E-237
  Methods 227 
tory masters who have won distinction in the honor 
schools of history at Oxford or Cambridge, and 
bring to the teaching of this important subject the 
enthusiasm and skill, which are likely to win a 
larger recognition for this subject in the school 
curriculum in the future. It is also to be hoped 
that it may win individual recognition and place 
on the printed course of study, and not, as is often 
the case at present, be classed under English 
with English literature. Then the searcher after 
knowledge will be able to tell more easily what is 
the average time allotment for history, and this 
worthy subject will gain something in estimation 
by being classed by itself, separate from other 
English branches. 
As to methods of teaching history, the system 
in the lower form generally consists of the thor- 
ough study of a reliable, but not elaborate, text- 
book. The work of the pupil is more often tested 
by written work than by oral questioning. The 
custom of “fluent” recitations on an assigned 
topic, which I have seen admirably carried on in 
German gymnasia, is not at all common in English 
schools. Certainly one of the valuable benefits of 
studying history ought to be the development of 
the power of oral expression, which such methods 
promote. Equally valuable also is the mental 
discipline and acuteness to be derived from rapid
-P-A-G-E-238
  228 English Schools 
and incisive questioning, and prompt answers, a 
system of cross-examination, which is commonly 
known in this country under the phrase “ quiz.” 
The absence of this system of fluent recitation of 
historical facts is probably due to the prejudice so 
common in England against fluency of speech as 
a possible indication of superficiality or lack of 
scholarship. 
The system of teaching known in the United 
States as the “library method,” or the “laboratory 
method,” viz. the use of several books in the study 
of a list of topics, is seldom found except in the 
highest forms where pupils are making special 
preparation for the history scholarship examina- 
tions at the universities. At this stage of the 
course the text-book work is supplemented by lec- 
tures by the teacher, so that the pupils attain facil- 
ity in taking notes, and by collateral reading so 
that they learn how to consult with permanent 
profit the books in a library. In this way, to use 
Dr. Arnold’s phrase, “they learn how to read.” 
They thus become acquainted with the methods 
which will be of great service to them when they 
go in for honors in the School of History at Ox- 
ford, or the Historical Tripos at Cambridge. This 
power of going to the heart of a book and secur- 
ing a deposit of its contents in their minds is a 
characteristic of the best boys in the Sixth at a
-P-A-G-E-239
Effectiveness 220 
great public school. For hard and thorough read- 
ing is the essential condition of success in winning 
a school exhibition or an entrance college scholar- 
ship, which are the intellectual honors crowning 
an able boy’s career at school. Such reading, 
however, is generally confined to secondary histo- 
ries. The earnest use of the sources with second- 
ary school pupils is very rare in England, and such 
methods are not much used with the average stu- 
dent at the universities. Essay writing on his- 
torical subjects is very commonly followed in the 
higher forms with success and profit, not only for 
its own sake, as a means of culture, but also as a 
means of preparatory training for this work in the 
university, inasmuch as in the Honor School of 
History at Oxford one of the most important and 
valuable means of training is the essay work with 
the tutor. 
In conclusion, it would hardly be proper for a 
visitor with so limited an experience of the actual 
teaching of history in English schools, to give a 
general judgment as to the quality of the teaching 
of this important subject in the great public schools. 
He may be permitted to quote, instead, the public 
testimony on this point of three Englishmen, who 
are competent judges. The first is Professor Bryce, 
who, in the article already referred to, says, “ His- 
tory is of all subjects which schools attempt to
-P-A-G-E-240
  230 English Schools 
handle perhaps the worst taught.” The second is 
an eminent teacher and writer of history and an 
old public school boy. He says, “The teaching of 
history in the English public schools is not nearly 
so efficient as teaching in other branches of know- 
ledge.” The third is the editor of the London 
Journal of Education, and master of the modern 
side in Merchant Taylor’s School, London. His 
words in the issue of February, 1899, are, “It is 
generally admitted that the teaching of history is 
exceedingly bad in our schools —with, of course, 
marked exceptions.” 
Secondary education is at present the burning 
question among educators in England, and a great 
change in the relation of the schools to the govern- 
ment is at hand. Doubtless the next few years 
will see a general improvement in history teaching, 
especially if the classicists will be willing to surren- 
der to the historians a little of the time allotment 
which they now demand for the ancient languages. 
Yet with all the deficiencies of the present situa- 
tion, the writer, in his admiration for the work of 
the English public school, feels it but just to say 
that the history teaching reflects the general char- 
acteristics of the whole school system, thorough- 
ness and virility.

Appendix VI 
History in Canadian Secondary 
Schools’ 
BY GEORGE M. WRONG 
In Canada there has been no really great crisis 
like that of the Revolution or of the Civil War 
in the United States to intensify historical in- 
terest. Many a citizen of Canada is not sure 
whether the old land of his ancestors or the new 
one of his birth or adoption is his real country. 
He still belongs to both, and his patriotic interest 
is widely diffused. Perhaps, as a result, he is more 
cosmopolitan, but he is usually wanting in that 
almost fierce love for his country’s past which in 
the United States is so keen a stimulus to histori- 
cal study. A natural situation in Canada inimical 
1 This short article on “ History in the Canadian Schools” was 
written, at the request of the committee, by Professor Wrong, pro- 
fessor of history in the University of Toronto. No study of Cana- 
dian schools has been made by the committee. 
231
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 Canadian Schools 
to history has not been improved by enlightened 
policy. The Canadian universities, like the Scotch, 
have, until recently, quite neglected history. The 
subject had only a minor place in the curriculum, 
and no adequate training in historical method was 
furnished. Happily a marked change has taken 
place. In the two largest Canadian universities 
(the University of Toronto and McGill University) 
history now occupies a respectable place, though 
it still receives far less attention than universities 
of similar importance give it in the United States. 
There is no uniform educational system in Can- 
ada; the government of each Province is charged 
with education as is that of each State in the United 
States. The Federal Government in Canada has 
not even the shadowy oversight of education that 
is implied in the United States by the existence of 
a federal commissioner of education. Nearly five 
of the six millions of people in Canada are in the 
provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In Quebec the 
schools are chiefly French, and are largely under 
the control of the Roman Catholic Church. Ob- 
viously the province of Ontario must be the 
principal field of our inquiries. This province, 
containing nearly half of the population of Can- 
ada, owes the first organization of its government 
to the American Revolution. Thousands of 
Loyalists, who refused to consent to the sever-
-P-A-G-E-243
  Organization 233 
ance of the American colonies from Great Britain, 
found a refuge in what is now Ontario. Many of 
them belonged to the educated classes, and had a 
zeal for education similar to that of the New Eng- 
land pioneers. The early governors too were on 
the whole enlightened men, who for many years 
wielded a power almost despotic. Extensive lands 
were set apart for educational purposes. For a 
long time the Anglican Church struggled to con- 
trol state-aided education. She failed in the end. 
Roman Catholics still have separate schools sup- 
ported by the rates levied on the taxpayers adher- 
ing to that Church, but the remainder of the state 
system is now completely secularized. 
The secondary schools are numerous, and are 
sometimes found in villages of less than one 
thousand inhabitants. The state university for a 
long time charged an annual fee of only ten 
dollars. Now it is but forty dollars, so that a 
college course is within the reach of a large num- 
ber. It is becoming not uncommon for a farmer’s 
son to take a degree in the university before set- 
tling down upon the farm. 
Until within the last ten years classics and mathe- 
matics claimed chief attention. Now, modern lan- 
guages are on about the same footing with them, 
the relative standard in mathematics being prob- 
ably the highest of all the subjects. History has 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
234 Canadian Schools 
a fairly good place in the lower forms, but an un- 
important one in the work for the college entrance 
examination, being worth only one-third of the 
value of Greek or Latin, and one-sixth of that of 
mathematics. 
The curriculum in the secondary schools of On- 
tario is limited to the history of ancient Greece 
and Rome, of England, and of Canada. In some 
of the smaller provinces an outline of general 
history is included. History is compulsory in 
every year of the course, which usually extends 
over about four years. In some schools five hours 
a week are given to history; the average would 
be about three hours. The larger schools with 
five or more teachers have usually a specialist de- 
voted to history alone. In some of the smaller 
schools any member of the staff may have a class 
in history thrust upon him. 
Let me summarize briefly my criticisms and 
suggestions :— 
1. The adequate training of the teacher was for 
a long time neglected. There has been a twofold 
reason for this. On the one hand the real diffi- 
culties both of teaching and of learning history 
have been underestimated. Roederer, the minister 
of the first Napoleon, banished the teaching of 
history from the French schools on the ground 
that the subject could easily be learned without
-P-A-G-E-245
  Teachers 235 
being taught. This view is still widespread. In 
Canada it has hardly yet been realized that the 
truths of history are subtle, and may easily be 
missed, and that, to teach it, there must be added 
to a thoughtful study of the facts a vigorous and 
disciplined imagination, and the power of arrang- 
ing complex material effectively. Because the 
teaching was usually bad, pupils came to regard 
history as a dreary and painful study. The other 
cause of the insufficient training of teachers of 
history has been the defective work of the univer- 
sities, already referred to. The education depart- 
ment for Ontario has been quick to utilize for the 
schools the better work which the colleges are now 
doing in history. There is a system of specialist 
certificates for teachers. To teach classics, mathe- 
matics, etc., a high specialistic qualification had 
long been required. For a long time any one was 
allowed to teach history, but now a specialist in 
history must pass examinations hardly less diffi- 
cult than those for an honor degree in modern 
history at Oxford. The improvement of the teach- 
ing of history, as a result of this policy, will prob- 
ably soon be very marked. Of course it will still 
happen in the smaller schools that history will be 
taught by masters with no special qualifications, 
for these schools cannot have a master devoted 
exclusively to history. The point gained, however,
-P-A-G-E-246
  236 Canadian Schools 
is that history is now on the same footing as other 
departments with regard to specialist training. 
2. The curriculum is defective. The history 
of Greece and Rome to the Augustan age, and 
that of England and Canada, do not form a well- 
balanced course of historical study. It leaves 
untouched, almost, the great epochs of continental 
Europe, and makes it possible for a student to 
go up to the university, having scarcely heard of 
St. Bernard, Charles V., Frederick the Great, or 
Mirabeau. In Canada, a part of the British Em- 
pire, pupils know nothing of other portions of the 
same Empire — India or Australia; and, as far as 
I can learn, the history of the United States is not 
taught in any Canadian school. The curriculum 
suggested by the Committee of Seven is hardly 
suitable for Canada, but that portion of it which 
relates to the history of continental Europe might 
well be adopted in the Canadian schools. 
3. The time given to history is usually, though 
not always, inadequate. New subjects are making 
claims, sometimes extravagant, upon the time of the 
schools. In a large secondary school in Toronto, 
the time available weekly was divided into thirty-five 
periods. Of these the physical sciences claimed at 
first twenty-two, much to the amusement of the 
other departments. History with no technical 
language, appears to be easier than chemistry,
-P-A-G-E-247
Subjects and Methods 237 
and it may plausibly be urged that it should take 
a minor place upon the time-table. Friends of 
history ought to insist that an extension of the 
curriculum should go hand in hand with an exten- 
sion of the time for instruction. It should be laid 
down as a general rule that the teaching must 
cover the whole ground of the curriculum. The 
pupils usually remember what they read in the 
text-book only when they hear it talked about in 
the class. 
4. The text-books are inferior in quality. The 
Education Department requires the same text-book 
to be used in all the schools. For English history 
the highest classes use Green’s “Short History of 
the English People” — by far the best book on the 
list, but in my opinion not a good text-book. The 
other books are, on the whole, colorless compila- 
tions, “ confused in arrangement,” as one teacher 
writes to me, “bad in diction, and with no sense 
of proportion.” These defects are not peculiar to 
the books used in Canada. To pick out the salient 
features of a nation’s history and to describe them 
with both scientific precision and literary charm 
are tasks requiring rare gifts. Until our best 
minds turn to the unattractive but useful task of 
writing history text-books, we shall not have what 
we need. 
One may say in closing that though history has 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  238 Canadian Schools 
not as yet really flourished in the Canadian schools, 
its status is steadily improving. The key of the 
situation is really with the colleges. These train 
the teacher, and an able teacher properly trained 
will give dignity to and win a place for the subject. 
With such teachers the dreary history lesson has 
been transformed in some places in Canada into 
an animated lecture. Nearly every school has a 
library — often very incomplete, of course. A good 
teacher with a good library accessible to him, 
to which the pupils may also be referred — these 
will be the two best agents for improving the 
status of history. It is still true that the subject 
is often neglected, and I see no hope that a uni- 
form standard can be adopted in all the secondary 
schools. Those with a small staff sometimes try 
to cover as many subjects as do the larger schools, 
and the teaching of some branches must be slighted. 
One effective way of increasing the attention to 
history in the work for college entrance would be 
to establish competitive scholarships at matricula- 
tion for excellence in history. Such scholarships 
have done much for Greek, Latin, and Modern 
Languages. They have not yet been offered in 
connection with history, and naturally the best 
pupils bend their energies to the subjects that 
have the prospect of reward.

  Appendix VII 
Some Books and Articles on the 
Teaching of History 
Tue following titles have been selected from the 
vast number of books and articles relating to his- 
tory and its teaching, in the hope that they may 
prove helpful to teachers who may not already be 
acquainted with them. Longer lists will be found 
in Channing and Hart’s Guzde to the Study of 
American History, § 15, and at the beginning of 
the various chapters of Hinsdale’s How to Study 
and Teach History ; for discussions that have ap- 
peared since the publication of these works, see 
particularly the Educational Review, the School 
Review, and the Proceedings of the National Edu- 
cational Association, the Association of Colleges 
and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and 
the similar Association in New England, and 
the New England History Teachers’ Association.

Books with which every Teacher of History 
should be acquainted 
Cartes Kenpatt Apams, 4 Manual of Historical Lit- 
erature. Third edition. New York, Harpers, 1889. 
$2.50. 
Contains an introduction on the study of history, “ brief 
descriptions of the most important histories in English, 
French, and German,” and suggestions as to courses of 
reading on particular countries or periods. The work 
needs revision. SONNENSCHEIN’s Bibliography of History 
(reprinted from his Best Books and Reader's Guide, Lon- 
don, 1897, 4s. 6d.) is more recent, and, in some respects, 
more helpful. 
The American Historical Review. New York, Macmil- 
lan, quarterly since 1895. $3.00 a year (free to 
members of the American Historical Association). 
Every progressive teacher of history should keep abreast 
of current publications on historical topics. The most 
convenient method is by means of the book reviews and 
notes in the American Historical Review.

“No effort is made to tell the teacher yust what he 
shall teach, or just how he shall teach it. The aim is 
rather to state the uses of history, to define in a general 
way its field, to present and to illustrate criteria for the 
choice of facts, to emphasize the organization of facts with 
reference to the three principles of association, to indi- 
cate sources of information, to describe the qualifications 
of the teacher, and finally to illustrate causation and the 
grouping of facts by drawing the outlines of some impor- 
tant chapters of American history.” Written particularly 
for teachers in elementary and secondary schools.

Appendix VIII 
Maps and Atlases 
INTELLIGENT and effective teaching of history 
demands at every stage a well-chosen supply of 
maps and atlases. Besides a set of political and 
physical maps of the continents, such as are now 
found in almost every school, there are needed 
maps in greater detail, both political and physical, 
of the principal countries whose history is studied 
in the school, as well as sets of historical wall maps, 
indexed historical atlases, and a good modern ref- 
erence atlas of the world!’ Small outline maps in 
the possession of each pupil may also be used to 
advantage? This committee does not feel itself 
1 Maps on lantern slides are much cheaper than wall maps, and 
may easily be prepared or modified to illustrate any desired subject. 
A collection of map-slides sufficient for all the needs of secondary 
instruction in history may be got for $15.00 or $20.00, or even less. 
2Such are the Outline Maps and Progressive Outline Maps 
published by D. C. Heath & Co., Boston; the suggestive Relief 
Practice Maps of William Beverly Harrison, New York; the Out- 
line Maps of Rand, McNally, & Co., Chicago; and the detailed 
sheets issued by the United States Geological Survey.

  Ancient History 249 
called upon to give a complete annotated catalogue 
of the maps and atlases available for use in sec- 
ondary schools; but it has seemed within the 
province of the committee to suggest what may be 
regarded as the minimum geographical equipment 
for treating the various periods of history which 
have been outlined in the body of the report. 
The prices are quoted from publishers’ price-lists ; 
in case of foreign works they do not include the 
duty, when imported by an individual. 
1. Ancient History 
The best wall maps for the study of ancient 
geography are the Wandkarten zur alten Geschichte, 
prepared under the direction of Heinrich Kiepert 
and published in Berlin by D. Reimer. The Amer- 
ican agents are Rand, McNally, & Co., Chicago. 
The American prices for individual maps, mounted 
on common rollers, run from $6.00 to $8.00; the 
full set in a case, with spring rollers, costs $88.00. 
In Germany single maps vary in price from 15 to 
22 marks, according to map and mounting, and 
the cost of a set, without a case, is correspond- 
ingly less. The full set is desirable; the maps of 
Greece, Italy, and the Roman Empire are indis- 
pensable. The school should also possess good 
physical wall maps of Greece, Italy, and the Medi- 
terranean lands as a whole. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  250 Maps and Atlases 
The best desk atlas of ancient history is also: — 
Kiepert, Adas Antiquus. Twelve Maps of the Ancient 
World. American edition, Boston, B. H. Sanborn & 
Co., 1892. $2.00. 
Others are: — 
Ginn and Company's Classical Atlas. Boards, $1.40 ; 
cloth, $2.30. 
Longman's Classical Atlas. $2.00. 
At least one such atlas should always be at hand, 
and it may often be possible to require pupils to 
procure copies for themselves. 
A more elaborate work is : — 
SpPRUNER-SIEGLIN, Alas Antiguus. Gotha, Perthes. In 
parts, 20 marks; separate maps, 80 pfennigs each. 
For maps illustrating the early Middle Ages, 
see the following section. Some of the collections 
there mentioned also cover ancient history; the 
first part of MacCoun’s Historical Geography Charts 
of Europe is entitled “ Ancient and Classical,” and 
is sold separately (Boston, Silver, Burdett, & Co., 
$15.00). 
2. Medieval and Modern History 
The first essential for the teaching of medizeval 
and modern history is a large map of Europe; 
ordinary maps are apt to be too small to render
-P-A-G-E-261
Medieval and Modern 251 
much service in historical instruction. If the school 
can have but one large map it should be physical, 
since the detail of the modern political map obscures 
the fundamental geographical features and confuses 
the pupil with modern boundary lines.1_ This should 
be supplemented by a series of historical wall maps, 
of which the most scholarly is the Historischer 
Wandatlas of Spruner-Bretschneider, a set of ten 
maps, 62 by 52 inches, covering the period from 
A.D. 350 to 1815. (Gotha, Perthes, 1894; in loose 
sheets, 56 marks; mounted, in a portfolio, 90 
marks.) The medizeval and modern section of the 
Historical Geography Charts of Europe, prepared by 
Townsend MacCoun (Boston, Silver, Burdett, & 
Co., $15.00), consists of nineteen loose maps on 
manila paper, covering the period from a.p. 526 to 
1894. Modern maps of individual European coun- 
tries are also helpful, and, for the recent period, 
maps of the other continents are necessary. For 
special subjects and battle-fields, single sheets of 
the various government surveys will be found 
1 Physical features are conveniently brought out, in exaggerated 
form, by the relief maps prepared by Giuseppe Roggero, and pub- 
lished by G. B. Paravia & Co., Turin, Rome, and Florence. The 
set includes maps of Italy, Spain, France, Scandinavia, Germany, 
the British Isles, and the Balkan Peninsula, varying in size from 
8x10 to 10x12 inches; the price of each map is 2 lire, or 
including packing and postage (but not the duty, when imported 
by an individual), about 50 cents.
-P-A-G-E-262
252 Maps and Atlases 
useful, and can be had through any foreign book- 
seller. 
The best small atlas of European history is : — 
F. W. Purzcer, Historischer Schul-Atlas sur alten, 
mitileren und neuen Geschichte. Twenty-second 
edition, Bielefeld and Leipzig, Velhagen and Klas- 
ing, 1897. 2 marks; bound, 2 marks 70 pfennigs. 
It contains sixty-seven large and seventy-one 
small maps, but has no index of places. Other 
small atlases are the following : — 
C. Coxsecx, Zhe Public Schools Historical Atlas. 
Fourth edition. London and New York, Long- 
mans, 1894. $1.50. 
One hundred and one maps and plans, and an index 
of places. Begins with the fourth century a.p.; as the 
maps are for the most part reproduced from the Zgochs 
of Modern History, they are not very well distributed 
over the period. 
Kiepert and Wotr, Historischer Schul-Atlas zur alten, 
mitileren und neueren Geschichte. Seventh edition. 
Berlin, D. Reimer, 1896. Bound, 3 marks 60 
pfennigs. ‘Thirty-six maps. 
Ropert HENLOPEN LaBBERTON, Historical Atlas, 3800 
B.C. to 1886 A.D. Boston, Silver, Burdett, & Co., 
1886. $1.25. Sixty-four pages of maps. 
   
-P-A-G-E-263
  Medizval and Modern 253 
The school library should also possess one of 
the following excellent historical atlases, each 
of which covers ancient as well as medizval and 
modern history : — 
Gusrav Droysen, Allgemeiner historischer Handailas. 
Bielefeld and Leipzig, Velhagen and Klasing, 1886. 
20 marks ; bound, 25 marks. 
Eighty-eight pages of maps, with descriptive text. 
Franz SCHRADER, Atlas de Géographie Historique. Paris, 
Hachette, 1896. Bound, 35 francs. 
Fifty-five double-page plates and a large number of 
sketch-maps, with descriptive text and an index of places. 
Unfortunately, the only English atlas of the 
type of Schrader and Droysen, the Hzstorical Atlas 
of Modern Europe now appearing at the Clarendon 
Press under the editorship of Reginald Lane Poole 
(to be completed in thirty parts at 3s. 6d. each), is 
much more expensive and covers only the medizeval 
and modern periods. Freeman’s Historical Geog- 
vaphy of Europe (one volume of text and one of 
maps, London and New York, Longmans, 1881) 
is now out of print. 
Still greater detail will be found in — 
SPRUNER-MENKE, Hlandatlas zur Geschichte des Mittel- 
alters und der neuern Zeit. Gotha, Perthes, 1880. 
In parts, 85 marks 60 pfennigs. Any map may be 
had separately at 1 mark 20 pfennigs, 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  254 Maps and Atlases 
3- English History 
The study of English history requires in the 
first place large wall maps, political and physical, 
of the British Isles, and also — 
SAMUEL Rawson GarpINER, School Atlas of English His- 
tory. London and New York, Longmans, 1891, 
$1.50. 
For the proper comprehension of the conti- 
nental and imperial aspects of English history 
there is also needed much of the equipment neces- 
sary for the study of general medizval and modern 
history. This is the case particularly as regards 
wall maps; smaller maps of Europe and the 
colonies are largely represented in Gardiner’s 
admirable Ad/as. 
4. American History 
Information concerning the most serviceable 
maps for use in connection with classes in Ameri- 
can history will be found in Channing and Hart’s 
Guide to American History, § 21, and in the List 
of the Publications of the United States Geological 
Survey, which will be furnished on application to 
the Director of that Survey, Washington, D.C. 
Schools should always possess a good general
-P-A-G-E-265
English and American 255 
map of North America, and a large map of the 
United States, such as that published by the 
United States Land Office (price, unmounted, 
$1.25). Also useful is Albert Bushnell Hart’s 
Epoch Maps Illustrating American History (New 
York, Longmans, 1891. 50cents. Reprinted from 
the Lpochs of American History). The United 
States Geological Survey publishes for its own use 
a three-sheet, and a reduced one-sheet, physical 
map of the United States, giving only rivers, lakes, 
and contours, without political boundaries or names. 
This map may sometimes be obtained by special 
arrangement with the Survey, and it is almost 
indispensable, since the modern map with its state 
boundaries gives a wrong historical impression. 
These maps may best be supplemented by the 
various physiographic maps issued by the United 
States Geological Survey, and especially by the 
detailed topographic maps of small areas sold in 
sheets at 5 cents each (and in any combination 
of one hundred sheets at $2.00 per hundred; a 
list may be obtained on application), and by sets 
of historical maps which the teacher may prepare 
on outlines, such as those mentioned in the note on 
page 248. Townsend MacCoun also has a series 
of Historical Charts of the United States (Boston, 
Silver, Burdett, & Co., $15.00).

  “Decidedly the best one-voiume American History yet 
published.’’ — American Historical Review. 
STUDENTS’ HISTORY OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
By EDWARD CHANNING, 
Professor of History in Harvard University, 
With Suggestions to Teachers 
By ANNA BOYNTON THOMPSON, Thayer Academy, Soutn 
Braintree, Mass. 
8vo. Half Leather. Price, $1.40 
  
{PORTANT FEATURES. — Reproductions of Original Documents, Colored Maps; Excellent Iilustrations; Accurate Copies of Well-known Portraits; Lists of Standard Works for Small Library, Good Library, Very Good Library; Suggestions to Teachers; a Perspective of United States History; List of Books for Consultation at the Beginning of Each Chapter; Suggestive Questions and Topics at the Close of Each Chapter; Table of Important Dates; Marginal Notes throughout. 
Professor A. A. Freeman, reviewing this work in The American 
Historical Review, says: ‘‘ Decidedly the best one-volume American his- 
tory yet published. . .... In the preface the author has explained that his purpose in the publication of this work is to provide a text-book suited to the 
needs of the senior class in high schools and academies. He believes that 
‘the serious study of American History more fitly follows than precedes other countries and belongs to the maturer years of school life.’ The author 
assumes a considerable knowledge of American history on the part of pupils from the use of more elementary text-books in the lower grades. He accord- ingly omits all the stock stories and anecdotes which form so large a part of our elementary text-books. ... It is full of suggestions for both teachers and pupils. Miss Anna Boynton Thompson, of Thayer Academy, has written a chapter entitled ‘Suggestions to Teachers,’ in which she has 
described her own method of teaching. These suggestions will be very helpful to the teacher if he accepts them as ‘ suggestions’ and not as rules. . «+. They should prove of peculiar value in preparing pupils for the new requirements for entrance to college. Especially valuable are the marginal 
references on every page to standard works which contain a fuller account 
of each topic. Each chapter is headed by a list of books, special accounts, sources and bibliography, maps and illustrative material. In the last are found the names of titles of books of American literature. Everything is 
done to stimulate and aid a more thorough investigation by the student. 
The introduction is a study of the land and its resources and shows the 
influence of geographicai conditions in the development of the country. . . « The author displays a judicial and impartial spirit in relation to all contro- verted questions. ‘This is especially noticeable in the consideration of such topics as the administration of Andros in Massachusetts, the persecution of the Quakers at Boston, the effect of the English navigation laws, the char- acter and treatment of the Loyalists, and the execution of André. . There 
is a gratifying absence of cheap illustrations. ‘The volume contains many excellent portraits. The period since 1789 is treated by topics. The old arbitrary division by administrations is properly abandoned and is replaced by the following divisions: Federalist Supremacy, 1789-1800; Jeffersonian Republicans, 1801-1812; War and Peace, 1812-1829; The National Democ- racy, 1829-1844; Slavery in the Territories, 1844~x859; Secession, 1860- x86r: The Civil War, 1861-1865; National Development, 1865-1897.”

COMMENTS. 
j.™M. Gresnneood, Supt. of Schools, Kansas City, Mo.: ‘1 nave jum 
finished reading Channing’s Students’ History, and I closed it with the conviction that it is the best single-volume history of the Country that has yet been printed.” 
Frederic A. Vogt, Princifal Central High School, Buffalo, N.Y.: “Tt is a relief to see a history in which the military achievements give some space to the victories of peace and the growth of constitutional liberty, Mere incidents haye been weeded out, and the essential whole has been 
preserved in a continuous story. There is a breadth of view and loftiness of exposition which is scientific and much more profitable than a mere string of dates and events. The schemes for study, the outlines for reading, and the suggestions to teachers ought to make the book very helpful.” 
R. H. Bowles, Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, N.H.: “ After examining the book carefully, I feel convinced that it is the best work of 
the kind that has ever been done, or perhaps it would be fairer to 
Bits Channing to say that it is the only Ha of the kind that has been 
lone.” 
Miss Mabel Hill, State Normal School, Lowell, Mass.: “In the 
Bablestoe of Professor Edward Channing’s Students’ History of the United 
tates we have received a text-book of the first importance. Its spirited purpose, together with its philosophical point of view, sets it apart as Pociliadtyieepel Sori Htigh School work, alchowgh' its seupic, strong style gives it a place in the school-rooms of the grammar grades as a reference reading book.” 
Wallace E. Mason, Principal of High School, Leominster, Mass. ¢ “In regard to the History by Channing, I want to say that it is the finest in plan and execution that I have ever seen.” 
Arthur N. Burke, Principal of Monson Academy, Monson, Mass.: 
“ Channing’s Students’ History of the United States is certainly the best 
thing of its kind I have ever seen.” 
A. C. Yeaton, Westbrook Seminary, Deering, Me.: ‘1am delighted with it, for it is just such a book as I have been searching for.” 
Charles H. Keyes, Principal of High School, Holyoke, Mass.: “We have at last a text suited for High School use, and one that will help put the 
subject into the important place it ought to occupy in the curriculum of the 
secondary school. It is manifestly the work of one who is both an 
historian and a teacher, and it ought to meet with unprecedented success.” 
Miss Susan Osgood, High School, Binghampton, N.Y.:. “1 have 
examined it with care, and let me assure you, with ever increasing delight. It seems to me by far the strongest and in every way the best work of its kind that has yet appeared, and is exactly suited to our needs.” 
Thomas M. Cann, School of the Lackawanna, Scranton, Pa.: “1 am much pleased with the arrangement of the history. It is well adapted to the use of students in the higher classes.”” 
Reuben Post Halleck, Princifal Male High School, Louisville, Ky.: “The statements are clear, definite, and interesting. The list of books 
for consultation is very wisely selected.” 
John F, Haines, Supt. of Schools, Noblesville, Ind.: ‘1 can say most 
enthusiastically that for clearness of statement and orderly arrangement I 
have never seen its equal.” 
Albert A. Sanford, State Normal School, Stevens Point, Wis.: “The 
Suggestive Questions and Topics are the best I have ever seen introduced into a text. “Ihe maps showing movement of population are very useful.”

THE UNITED STATES. 
An Outline of Political History, 1492-1871- 
By GOLDWIN SMITH, D.C.L. 
Third Edition. With Map. Crown 8vo. $2.00. 
“ His survey of events is luminous, his estimate of character is singu- larly keen and just, and his style is at once i dignified, and scholarly: ++ Noone who takes up Mr. Goldwin Smith’s volume will readily lay it down before he has finished it; no one will lay it down without acknowledg- ing the rare gifts of the writer.” — The Times. 
        
“Is a literary masterpiece, as readable as a novel, remarkable for its 
compression without dryness, and its brilliancy without any rhetorical effort 
or display. What American could, with so broad a grasp and so perfect a style, have rehearsed our political history from Columbus to Grant in three 
hundred duodecimo pages of open type, or would have manifested greater candor in his judgment of men and events in a period of four centuries? It is enough to say that no one before Mr. Smith has attempted the feat, and 
that he has the field to himself.” — The Nation. 
“Tt is a marvel of condensation and lucidity. In no other book is the 
same field covered so succinctly and so well. Of the five chapters, the first 
deals with the Colonial epoch, the second with the Revolutionary period, the third and fourth review the history of the Federal Government to the 
outbreak of the Civil War, and the fifth depicts the era of rupture and recon- 
struction. We have marked certain passages for extract; but the truth is 
that almost every page is enriched with striking comments that cause the 
reader to carefully reconsider, if not to change, his views of historical 
persons and events.” — New Fork Sun. 
  “To say that nothing comparable with this most instructive and enchant- ing volume has hitherto come from Professor Smith’s pen, would, perhaps, be only anticipating the judgment of its readers.” — Toronto Mail. - 
“As a whole, has a comprehensiveness of view and a ready grasp of leading tendencies that should make it particularly useful to the busy man who desires a rapid survey of American political history. | By deliberately neglecting details, Professor Smith has been able to fasten the attention upon salient points, and to concentrate interest around the career of the great leaders in our political development.” — Boston Beacon. 
“No pen has ever been more eloquent than his in setting forth the merits 
of Washington, and Hamilton, and Webster, and Lincoln, and others of 
America’s great citizens. The chapters on ‘Democracy and Slavery’ and 
"Rupture and Reconstruction’ deserve thoughtful perusal by every Ameri- can, North and South.” — Puddic Opinion,

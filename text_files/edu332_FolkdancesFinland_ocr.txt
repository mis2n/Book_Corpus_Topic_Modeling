4 EXPLANATION OF TERMS USED IN THE DESCRIPTIONS 
OF THE 
The Numbers in Parentheses which appear in 
the descriptions, refer to the measures of the music 
which are numbered correspondingly. 
Position refers to the position taken by the 
dancers at the beginning of the dance (not at the 
beginning of a separate figure in a dance). 
Inside Hand is the one nearest to one’s own 
partner; the other is called the outside hand. 
The same explanation applies to the inside and 
outside foot. 
Ordinary Dance Grasp. The boy’s right arm is 
around the girl’s waist, the girl’s left hand is on the 
boy’s shoulder, and her right hand is in his left. 
Single Hand Grasp. The boy stands on the left 
of his partner and holds her left hand in his right, 
their elbows slightly bent. Outside hands on hips, 
with fingers turned backward. 
Double Hand Grasp. Partners stand facing each 
other, the boy holding the girl’s left hand in his 
right and her right in his left. 
Cross Hand Grasp. The boy stands on the left 
of the girl and takes her right hand in his right hand 
and her left in his left. 
High Hand Grasp. The boy and girl stand 
opposite each other and join right (left) hands, 
with elbows bent, fingers extended, and with the 
side of the little finger against the inside of the 
other’s thumb. 
Wormso Hand Grasp (in couples). Boy and 
girl stand facing each other. The boy holds the 
girl around the waist with his right arm, and places 
his left hand on her right shoulder. The girl holds 
the boy in the same manner. 
Wormso Hand Grasp (in a ring). Boys stand to 
the right of their partners and all with the left hand 
grasp the right hand of the one standing to the left, 
with the left hand on top. 
‘Ring Grasp. The dancers stand with hands 
joined in a ring. 
Double Ring Hand Grasp. Boys and girls form

separate ring hand in hand. The dancers of the 
25615 DANCES 
outside ring bring their hands over the heads of the 
others and down in front of them. 
Single Arm Grasp. The boy stands on the left 
of the girl, and with his right hand grasps her arm 
above the elbow. The girl takes hold in the same 
manner with her left hand. The outside hands are 
not placed on hips. 
Double Arm Grasp. Boy and girl stand opposite 
each other and grasp each other’s arms above the 
elbow. 
Arm Hook. Partners hook right (or left) arms 
with each other with elbows bent. 
Dance Around in Couples. Boy and girl stand 
facing each other, take double hand grasp and swing 
each other with or against the sun. 
Dance Around Each for Himself. An individual 
dancer makes one complete turn around against the 
sun, during which he takes five short steps with the 
left foot; after each step he brings the right foot 
up to the left until the fifth step with the right foot, 
which is made with a stamp in front of the left.

Chain. The dancers stand in a ring. Partners 
face each other and take right hand grasp, the girls 
go around the circle with the sun, and the boys go 
against the sun, taking left and right hand grasp 
alternately with the approaching dancers until they 
reach their own places again. 
Folding. Couples stand in a ring. With four 
(or six) steps the ring folds together parallel with 
the front. With the same number of steps it 
spreads to aring. With four (or six) steps the ring 
folds at right angles with the front and again spreads 
to a ring.

unless otherwise specified, and the free hand of each 
is held on the hip with the knuckles resting on the 
hip bone.

3 stand facing each other, while couples 2 and 4 
stand on the other two sides of the square, couple 2 
to the left and couple 4 to the right as seen from 
couple 1’s position. 
Head Couples are couples 1 and 3. 
Side Couples are couples 2 and 4. 
STEPS 
Walking, Running, Polka and Waltz Steps need 
no description. 
Hop Step. The left tase foot is put down in 
place, or a step forward, and then a hop is made on 
the same foot. 
Follow Step (or Change Step). The left (right) 
foot is moved forward, the right (left) toe is brought 
up behind the left (right) heel, and the left (right) 
foot is moved forward again. This last foot placing 
takes the same length of time as the first two to- 
gether. 
In “ Parikkalabon ” two follow steps (one with 
each foot) are taken during each measure. 
Polka Step. The left foot takes a step forward, 
the right foot is placed behind the left, the left foot 
again takes a step forward and then the right foot 
is brought forward. The same is danced beginning 
with the right foot. 
Schottische Step. The left foot is moved for- 
ward, the right toe is brought up behind the left 
heel. The left foot is again moved forward and a 
hop is made on it. 
with the right foot. 
Galop Step. One foot is moved straight to the 
side and the other is brought up beside it; this is 
done with a springy movement and so quickly that 
two such steps are taken during a 3 measure. The 
step can also be taken forward, in which case the 
same foot leads all the time. 
Side Step. This differs from the galop step only 
in that it is done much more slowly. 
Mazurka Step. One ordinary step, two quicker 
steps, and so on. The same is danced beginning 
25615 Polka-Mazurka Step. This is described in con- 
nection with “ Sjalaskuttan.” 
Jig Step. The right foot is placed around behind 
the left foot and a hop forward is made on the right 
foot, while at the same time the left foot is lifted, 
and brought around behind the right foot. Then 
the left foot is put down behind the right foot and a 
hop forward is made on the left foot, and so on. 
Three-step Waltz. The left foot takes one step 
diagonally forward and at the same time both knees 
are bent slightly; the right foot is brought up to the 
left foot, the left foot again takes one step forward, 
and at the same time thé knees are straightened. 
The same step is danced beginning with the right 
foot. 
Treading Step (danced only by men). The 
dancer takes a step to the side with the left foot, at 
the same time turning against the sun, then steps 
past the left foot with his right foot, again turning 
against the sun. 
Fall Out Step. The dancer ie a very long 
step forward or to the side with the left (right) foot 
— bending that knee, but keeping the right (left) 
leg firmly extended — and inclines the body over 
the bent leg. 
Stride Step. With a hop the dancer separates 
his feet, placing them about two feet apart, then 
with a hop brings them together again. 
Heel Step. When a dancer places one foot for- 
ward with the toe turned up so that only the heel 
touches the ground, this is called “ heel step.” 
Foot Changing with Heel Step. The left (right) 
foot is placed forward with the heel on the ground,
-P-A-G-E-7
  the right (left) foot takes a step in place, and then 
the left (right) foot is placed beside the right (left). 
Foot Changing with Hop. The dancer with a 
hop places the left (right) foot forward and the 
right (left) foot backward at the same time. Some- 
times this is done with the toe of the forward foot 
turned up (Heel Step). 
Fist Hop. With a hop the dancer puts down 
25615 both feet (with the left foot forward), at the same 
time twisting the body to the right, and raising the 
left arm with elbow bent and fist clenched; the 
right hand is held on the hip. The same is re- 
peated with the right foot forward and the body 
twisted to the left. 
Harvest Step and Rocking Step. These are de- 
scribed in connection with the “ Harvest Dance.”

other and drag the inside feet on the ground. Then 
begin with the inside feet, and on the third step 
turn with backs toward each other and drag the

“go forward four rocking steps, inclining the body in 
the opposite direction on each step and handling 
the scythes as if mowing. When the left foot be- 
gins the step the scythe is swung from right to left, 
and the reverse.

Steps. Polka-mazurka, and galop steps. 
The Polka-Mazurka Step is danced in the follow- 
ing manner: One foot takes a step forward, the 
other is brought up close behind it, whereupon the 
front leg is lifted from the ground and swung for- 
ward; then it is swung backward (though not past 
  the other leg), and at the same time a hop forward 
is made on the back leg. 
In this dance the step is always begun with the 
outside foot. 
Position. The dancers stand hand in hand in 
couples behind each other.

Position. One boy, “ Daniel,” stands in the 
centre, and four girls in a square surrounding him 
about four steps distant from him. All stand fac- 
ing in the same direction, with hands on hips (see 
Diagram). 
(1-8) All dance stride steps once to each meas- ure. At the end of every other measure all face 
to the left. This is done four times.

right. 
(1-16) Now “ Daniel” becomes restless and be- 
gins hopping twice as fast, thus making four hops 
to each measure; but the others follow his ex- 
ample, and thus “ Daniel” never succeeds in see- 
ing the girls’ faces, as they continually turn away 
from him. 
(1-16) Then this is repeated again, beginning 
in the original slow time. “ Daniel” now seems 
worn out and hops with tottering knees.

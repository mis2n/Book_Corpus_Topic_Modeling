CLaus, CHRISTMAS FarRIEs, as many as 
practical.

Mrs. S. (enters R., goes to table and pours water

into glass, while talking). I do wonder where 
Santa is? I have looked through all the work- 
rooms and over the whole house, but he is not to 
be found. (Zurns around as she puts glass to 
lips, sees SANTA, puts down glass, and runs to 
Santa.) Asleep! It can’t be possible. Santa! 
(Takes him by shoulder and shakes him gently.) 
What in the world is the matter with you to be 
sound asleep, at this time of all times, Santa? 
(Shakes him again.) This is the strangest thing 
that I ever heard of. J do hope no one will come 
in until he awakes. If it should once be known 
that he is asleep, I fear the work would stop in- 
stantly. I believe I’d better lock the door. 
(Goes to R. entrance, talks while returning to 0.) 
Now we cannot be disturbed and I must waken 
him. Santa! (Shakes him again.) Santa! (A 
little louder.) Santa! (Still louder.) Santa! 
(Moves away a few steps and looks athim.) He is 
as stillas a statue. Oh, horrors, what if he is dead ? 
(Wrings her hands and weeps.) But there, how 
foolish of me! He cannot die; he is immortal. 
Oh! I know, he has swooned. I must call for 
help. (Runs to RK. entrance again.) No, no, that 
will never do. No one must see him in this condi- 
tion. (Comes down and, as she passes table.) Oh, 
T have it. I have heard that water is good for peo- 
ple in a faint, so why shouldn’t it be good for 
him? T’ll try it. (Zakes up glass, hurries to 
Santa and throws it in his face.)
-P-A-G-E-7
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 9 
Santa (waking, rubs face). What's that ? 
Ugh, water all over me. Am I ina duck pond, 
or where am I? (Sees Mrs. 8.) Did you throw 
that water on me? (Angrily.) What do you 
mean by such conduct? Bring me a towel. 
(Knocking at door.) Come in, whoever you are ; 
give me a towel, I say. (Anocking continues.) 
Why don’t you come in, and why don’t you give 
me a towel, wife ? 
Mrs. 8. (running about in confusion). They 
can’t come in, the towel is locked, or, I mean, I 
can’t get you a towel until they come in. (Anock- 
ing increases.) No,no, I mean they can’t come in 
till I unlock the towel. Oh, dear, that isn’t what 
I mean, but the doors are all up-stairs and so they 
can’t get a towel until I come in. Oh, dear, dear, 
dear, whatever do I want tosay,anyway ? (Puts 
hands to head and runs about aimlessly.) 
Santa (taking handkerchief from his pocket 
and wiping his face and hands). You may well 
ask what you want to say, but I should judge, 
from your somewhat mixed phraseology, that you 
wish me to understand the towels are all up-stairs, 
and you cannot go after one without admitting 
the knocker. Is that it ? 
Mrs. S. Oh, yes, dear Santa, how clever you 
are. 
Santa. Well, now, compose yourself, and the 
first thing you do unlock that door. What made 
you lock it, anyway? Were you afraid I’d be
-P-A-G-E-8

kidnapped? (Knocking ceases.) Well, they’re 
gone at last, I hope. 
Mrs. S. (goes to R. entrance). Yes, they’re 
gone; there is no one here. I am so glad. 
(Comes down.) But, dear Santa, when I came in 
here, and found you sound asleep in your chair I 
was so frightened. I knew it would never do for 
any one else to find you in that condition at this 
time of year. What a talk it would have made! 
I tremble to think of it. So I locked the door to 
keep every one out until I succeeded in awaking you. 
Santa. And then you proceeded to drown me. 
Oh, it’s lucky I am good-natured. 
Mrs. S. So it is, Santa dear, and I know you 
are just the best old fellow that ever lived. For- 
give me; but I was frightened almost to death 
when you just wouldn’t wake up. How could 
you go to sleep at such a time as this? I went 
through the workrooms and there aren’t presents 
enough to go half-way around. Come, now, get 
up, and look after things a little. 
SanvA (settling back more comfortably in his 
chair). Nothing needs looking after, my dear. 
Everything is going on according to my orders. 
Mrs. 8. According to your orders! Well, 
then you must intend to slight a great many peo- 
ple this year. (Sits in chair near by.) 
Santa. What a very shrewd woman you are, 
Mrs. Santa; you have guessed right the very first 
time.
-P-A-G-E-9
  ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 11 
Mrs. 8. Oh, Santa, my own dear Santa, how 
ean you think of doing a thing like that? What 
will ever become of the poor mortals ? 
Santa. They will be a thousand times better 
off. But, even if they weren’t, I should follow 
out my present plan. Have you any idea what a 
burden my duties have become ? 
Mrs. S. Oh, yes, dear Santa, I am sure I re- 
alize it. 
Santa. They have not only shut me out of 
their chimneys entirely, forcing me to climb in 
cellar windows and up porch pillars, and go 
stringing their horrible wires around the houses, 
so that my reindeer get their silver shod feet all 
tangled up at the risk of breaking both their 
necks and mine, but they require me to bring 
presents for all the grown-ups. Now, you know, 
as well as I, that I started on my mission of pres- 
ent giving to please the children and only them. 
So, I have turned over a new leaf, and this year 
no one gets a present from me except the children, 
the poor and the sick. 
Mrs. 8S. Oh, Santa, what will the mortals do ? 
Santa. [Tm sure I don’t care. Maybe they’ll- 
hunt up a new saint. I really wish they would. 
I am beginning to want a rest anyway. 
Mrs. 8. It is hard for you, and it will be hard 
enough even when you give only to the children, 
for some of them want so many things. 
Santa. So they do. There was little Jack
-P-A-G-E-10
12 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
Screamer ; last year ke had about fifty presents. 
And then he cried and kicked the floor, and 
pounded his nurse-maid because I hadn’t brought 
him an automobile that he could ride in. I tell 
you, wife, tke rising generation of mortals is 
growing so selfish that something must be done, 
so I am the one to do it. 
Mrs. 8. That is true, Santa, you always were 
so clever. 
Santa. So, this year I-am giving but one 
present, but one, mind you, to each child; then, 
beside that, I shall place a package marked thus, 
“To be given to some children less fortunate than 
yourself,” and as I know all the children so well 
I have put into these packages nice presents for 
the poorer children. So, you see, this year every 
child will know the blessed sweetness of making 
some one else happy. 
Mrs. S. (rising and going to him). Dear 
Santa, I am so sorry that I wakened you. 
(Smoothing his brow.) Now, close your eyes and 
I will call in the Christmas fairies to sing you to 
sleep. 
“(Sanra closes eyes. Mrs. S. slaps hands quickly. 
Enter CHRISTMAS FarrRtins, R., i single file. 
They come to 0. and sing.)

_ THE CHRISTMAS PEACEMAKER 
(A Dialogue for Three Girls) 
CHARACTERS.—STELLA, Luciz, ALICE (this 
character has few lines to repeat). Ordinary 
home costumes. 
ScENE.—Handsome interior. Small table and 
two chairs near F. ©. 
(STELLA 7s discovered ut rise, busy with embroi- 
dery, seated near table.) 
Luoctn (enters R., carrying book with finger 
marking place; comes down). Dear me, I was 
never so horribly dull in my whole life, and here 
you sit bending over that unceasing embroidery. 
STELLA (without looking up). How can you 
be dull with a new book to read ? 
Luctz. Book! (lings it on the table angrily, 
and sits in chair.) It is even more stupid than I 
am. Do put away that work, Stella, and let us 
have a game of some sort. 
STELLA. Well, what shall it be? Select your 
game and I am ready. 
Lucrr. You look like it. Not for one mo- 
ment lifting your eyes from your work. 
STELLA. Why should I, until you have chosen 
the game ? 
Lucire (settling back in her chair with a 
14 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 15 
fling). Oh, I don’t care what game we play ; one 
is just as stupid as another. You choose. 
SteLtia. If you leave the choice to me, I 
would suggest work instead of play. If you 
would get something to do, Lucie, you would be 
surprised to see how the time would fly. To see 
a piece of work grow under your hands gives a 
zest —— 
LuctE (interrupting). There now, don’t 
preach ; that’s the last straw. 
SteLtLa. Really, Lucie, I don’t know what to 
advise. You seem so thoroughly out of tune 
with everything. That is a most unfortunate 
state of mind for the Christmas tide. Didn’t you 
enjoy your book ? : 
Luotz. No; it was like everything else disap- 
pointing. The heroine was having a horribly 
dull time wita chree maiden aunts, living in a 
‘round of sweeping, dusting and dish-washing, 
dreaming all the while of the great things which 
she meant to do some day. 
STELLA (laughing). Just as you do? 
LuotE. Well, yes, I suppose so, only there was 
this difference ; something came into her life that 
gave her a chance to do a great deed. A little 
child fell into a well and she rescued her. 
STELLA. And what then? 
Lucie. Oh. I was so out of patience, tnat I 
quit reading and came in here to you. I don’t 
see why people who write stories don’t show us
-P-A-G-E-14
    16 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
how to be happy doing little things. They are 
the only kind that come in the way of most of us. 
Now, if I were a story-book girl in this deadly- 
dull town the house would catch fire, or some 
one’s horses run away, and give me a chance to 
do some great, heroic deed that would color my 
whole life thereafter. (Sighs.) 
STELLA. Perhaps if you'll look around you 
carefully, youll find something to do to help 
some one. 
Lucire. Oh, yes. I know all about “doing the 
next thing,” and fulfilling small duties, etc., etc. 
I suppose I might go up-stairs and comb grand- 
ma’s hair; that’s the next thing. 
STELLA. No, I did that long ago. Yow'll 
have to think of something else. 
Lucir. Well, then, I might go over to Mrs. 
Brown’s and tidy up her dirty house, while she 
holds her sick baby, but I hate untidy houses, 
and sick babies as well. Besides, ] want some- 
thing to do that is pretty and bright and Christ- 
masy and all that. Surely I have a right to ex- 
pect something that is at least interesting since 
nothing grand and magnificent falls to my lot. 
SreLLa. Well, I can tell you of something 
that is at least interesting and what you call 
“Christmasy ” too. 
Luctr. Do tell me at once; are you sure it is 
within the range of my possibilities ? 
STELLA. Oh, quite so. Yet, don’t be disap-
-P-A-G-E-15
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 17 
pointed, for it’s nothing very showy. You 
remember we are to practice that Christmas 
tableau to-morrow afternoon, but we haven’t 
enough little girls. We ought to have at least 
six more. 
LuctxE (rising quickly). Oh, I see, and you 
want me to find the little girls. Well, that will 
be fun. 
Srerya. Fun to you, but it would be an 
awful bore to some people. 
Lucrz.: Perhaps; but I like children and 1 
love to go about seeing people. I think I can 
find all that you need without going far. I will 
see those that I know in this block first, and I am 
sure they can send me to others. (Bell rings.) 
STELLA. Oh, dear, I hope that is no one 
for us. I do want to finish this centerpiece 
within the next hour. 
Luctn. I wonder if it can possibly be Alice ? 
STELLA (dropping her work). Alice! 
Lucre. Yes, Alice. You say it as though she 
were some dreadful person. 
STELLA. Is it possible you don’t know, Lucie ? 
Luctr. Know what? Oh, Stella, you know 
T always hated riddles. 
SreLia. She and I quarreled when I was here 
on my last summer’s vacation, and we haven’t 
spoken since. 
Luctr. Well, I am surprised. She didn’t tell 
me a word about it, and as I wasn’t here last
-P-A-G-E-16

summer with you, I had no way of knowing it. 
But you needn’t see her. She is coming to show 
me that new crochet stitch. I’ll take her into the 
parlor. What did you quarrel about ? 
STELLA. A trifle, of course. I dare say that 
I was the more to blame. 
Lucre (aside). If she’ll admit that, the peace 
is half made. (Zo SteLua.) There, the maid is 
showing her into the parlor. Better come too. 
SreLLa. Not for the world, unless she asks 
for me. 
Lucire (aside). Well, a few words from me 
will send her in to you. (Zo Sreixia.) But you 
have your embroidery, so you'll not miss me. 
“To see a piece of work grow under your hands,” 
you know, “gives a zest ——” 
(Exit Lucty, R.) 
. STELLA (rises and throws down work). Oh, 
dear, oh, dear, what is work to me, when Alice is 
so near me, and yet I cannot see her or hear her 
speak ? She has been my dearest friend ever since 
we were babies. (Buries her face in her hands 
and sobs.) I am almost tempted to go into the 
parlor and beg her to forget that we ever 
quarreled. To think, only two days before 
Christmas, and yet we, who have spent so many 
happy Christmas times together, are enemies. 
Oh, it is dreadful. (Sobs. Votces heard behind 
scenes.) Is it possible Lucie is bringing her in
-P-A-G-E-17
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 19 
here? Oh, that cannot be; she is too proud. 
She would never come to me. 
LuctE (entering R.). Stella, I am_ bringing 
Alice to you. I told her what you said, that it 
was all your fault, but she said no, it was her 
fault entirely, so now you can settle that matter 
between you. 
(ALICE enters R. STELLA turns about and 
starts forward.) 
STELLA. Alice. 
ALICE. Stella. (Zhey run to each other and 
embrace.) 
Lucie. Well, this is Christmasy enough for 
almost any one. 
Sretia. Oh, Lucie, how can I thank you 
enough ? 
Luciz. Never mind me. I’m going out after 
those little girls. Dear me, what a delightful 
world this is! 
(Heit Lucte, RB.) 
SteLtta. We ought to have told her, “ Blessed 
are the peacemakers.” But now, come up-stairs 
with me and I'll show you the Christmas presents 
that I have made. Oh, how lonesome I have 
been without you. (Puts arm about her waist.) 
ALICE (imitating her action). And I without 
you. ;

; A SUITABLE SUCCESSOR 
(A Christmas Dialogue) 
CHARACTERS.—MotTHEeR Goosk, FATHER GaAN- 
DER, as many of the Mother Goose characters 
as possible. The following are the only ones 
gwen speaking parts: Boy Buun, Miss Mur- 
FETT, Tom, THE PIPER’s Son, SIMPLE SIMON, 
BACHELOR, QUEEN OF Hearts, OLD WomAN 
IN THE SHOE, TAFFY. 
CostuMES.—FaTHER GANDER and MoTHER 
Goosx, old-fashioned home costumes. The 
Mother Goose characters’ costumes can be copied 
Srom the illustrations in any good Mother Goose 
book. The characters whose rhymes refer to 
eatables must carry representations of the desig- 
nated articles. Thus the QUEEN carries a glass 
ja marked “honey” and a loaf of bread. 
Santa CLAvs wears the usual costume. 
ScENE.—Ordinary interior ; large apne at O., 
chairs R. and i. 
(Enter MorHerR Goose and FatHER GANDER, 
R., MOTHER GOOSE leading.) 
MorHer Goosx. It is the most absurd thing 
that I ever heard of. It cannot be done, I tell 
you. (Sits at R. of table.)

FatHer GANDER. It may seem absurd to you 
but it certainly does not to me. 
Moruer Goosr. But it is impossible. 
FarHer GANDER. You have no means of 
knowing that a thing is impossible until you try 
it. 
Morurer Goosr. That is false reasoning, 
Father Gander. According to that, you might 
say I don’t know whether or not I can jump over 
the house until I try it. 
FarHEerR GANDER (crossly). Well, you don’t, 
you don’t. 
Morurr Goosr. Oh, yes, Ido. My imagina- 
tion helps me out on things like that. I can just 
imagine myself jumping over the house, and I can 
see with my mental vision that it is a feat quite 
beyond me. 
FatHErR GANDER (scornfully). And pray how 
does your imagination help you out in this case ? 
Moruer Goose. Just the same. I can imag- 
ine myself trying to perform the duties of Santa 
Claus and failing miserably. 
FaruEer GanpeEr. Yes, of course, if you tried 
to go through with them alone; but remember, 
my dear, you will have my help. (Struts about.) 
MotuEr Goosr. Even with that powerful ad- 
dition, it would be quite impossible. But what in 
the world put this foolish idea into your head ? 
FarHer GANDER. Haven’t you heard the 
rumors that are afloat all through Fancy-land ? 
   
-P-A-G-E-20
  22 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
MoTHER GoosE. No, indeed, not a rumor. 
FarHEeR GANDER. Well, it is reported that 
Santa Claus is very tired of his Christmas labors 
and would gladly resign if he could find a suitable 
successor. 
MoruEr Goosr. Oh, yes, there’s the rub ex- 
actly ; a suitable successor ; but that is something 
that will never be found. 
FaTHER GANDER. My dear, don’t be so 
modest. Since you have done more for chil- 
dren than even Santa Claus himself, I am sure 
you would be a suitable successor. Santa Claus 
serves them but once a year while your dream 
children delight them always. 
MorueER Goosr. Don’t talk about it any more. 
It is impossible, but hark! That sounds like Boy 
Blue’s horn. (Horn is blown behind scenes, sounds 
of crying, bleating of sheep, lowing of cows, cack- 
ling of hens, etc.) Well, really, it sounds as if my 
children are all coming home together. 
FatHER GANDER. Aren’t you glad ? 
MotuHeEr Goosr. Of course; a mother is al- 
ways glad to see her children, but at the same 
time she has to think what she will give them to 
eat. 
FatHER GANDER. Oh, they'll get along; 
they'll bring their blackbird pie, the Queen will 
bring her bread and honey, the Bachelor his bread 
and cheese, and perhaps the Jack of Hearts will 
give us some of his stolen tarts.
-P-A-G-E-21
  ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 23 
MoruER Goosr. We don’t want the stolen 
tarts. I wouldn’t eat one of them for the world. 
Don’t you know if we should we could be ar- 
rested for concealing stolen property ? 
FaTHER GANDER. So we could. Oh, it’s a 
great head you have on you, Mother Goose. 
MorHeEr Goosr. We should be what the law- 
yers call “accessory after the fact.” 
FatHER GANDER (to audience). Listen to 
that! What learning! And yet she thinks she 
is not competent to be a successor to Santa 
Claus. But dear me! there come the children. 
(Mother Goose characters enter R. in great con- 
fusion. They run to table and place whatever 
they are carrying upon it. MoTHER Goose 
and FatTHER GANDER stand beside table and 
greet cach character with bows and smiles as he 
or she comes up. MotHER Goosn’s neat speech 
is not made until all are gathered around table.) 
MortuHErR Goosr. I am so glad to see you, but 
I hardly dared hope you could be here. You are 
always so busy at this time of year. 
Boy BuuxE (coming down). True, Mother, but 
we felt we must come since Father Gander de- 
manded it. It is so seldom that he asks anything 
of us. 
MotHER GoosE (in great surprise). Father 
Gander! So this is your doing? (Zo him.)
-P-A-G-E-22

Faruer GanpEr. Yes, my dear, just a little 
surprise for you as a Christmas present. 
Morurer Goosx. But it is too much for the 
dear children at this time of year. Just think 
how the poor mortal children will miss them. 
Miss Murrett (coming down). Oh, they will 
not know we are gone. We will not stay long, 
and when we put on our cyclone boots, which we 
left standing just outside your door, we will be 
back to Earthland before the peep of day. 
MotTHuER GoosE. Oh, dear, but those cyclone 
boots are likely to harm the poor mortals as you 
go stalking through the air above them. 
Tom THE PrpER’s Son (coming down). No, we 
mean to be very careful this time, and not get 
near enough to Earthland to do any harm. 
Morner Goose. But in spite of your care 
you know you often do a great deal of mischief. 
Srupie Stmon. That’s when they try to see a 
pieman, they get down so close to earth then, you 
know. Piemen are so mean, too; they’re not 
worth looking at. 
BAcuHELOR (coming down). The maid in the 
garden is the worst one; she always was an in- 
quisitive creature. Some of these times she’ll lose 
her whole head, instead of her nose. 
MorHER GoossE (looking around). But I don’t 
see her anywhere. 
QUEEN or Hearts. No, you remember how 
much trouble she has had with her nose ever since

the Blackbird nipped it off. Dr. Bumblebee 
fastened it on pretty well with beeswax, but at 
this time of the year when she sits around the

it would be safer for her to stay at home. 
FatHer GANDER. Oh, well, let her stay 
there if she wants to. But now I want to give 
you my reason for calling you together. 
ALL. Reason, reason, we don’t like reason. 
FarHer Ganper. I know it, and your mother 
has very foolishly allowed you to grow up that 
way. But things will change when I’m at the 
helm. And so, to begin at once, I want to know 
if you have heard that Santa Claus wants to re- 
sign his job? (AZ groan and then cry, “ No, no, 
no.”) It is true; he declares the work has be- 
come too much for him. (Cries of “ He can’t,” 
“ He shavt!”) Now don’t interrupt me; he de- 
clares he will resign just as soon as ———  (@roans 
are repeated.) Now wait and hear me through. 
Where was I? Oh, yes, he will resign as soon as 
he finds a suitable successor. (Great laughter, 
well prolonged.) You seem to think that is very 
funny. It doesn’t strike me that way at all. Do 
you think a successor is impossible to find ? 
(Cries, “So it is, a suitable one.”) But it can be 
done, my children, it really can be done. (Cries 
of “ Where is he, where is he?”) Of course it 
must be some one who understands mortals and 
who has done, much for their children.

MorHEerR Goose. Yes, but that isn’t the 
fashion in Earthland nowadays, and you would 
soon be turned out of office if you kept up your 
favorite pastime. No. I think just as my chil- 
dren do, that it is impossible to find a suitable 
successor to dear Santa Claus, and so he will 
have to remain at his post for a few centuries 
longer. 
FaruEer GanprEr. Your mother is altogether 
todo modest and unassuming. I have been trying 
to convince her that she is just the person to suc- 
ceed Santa Claus, with my help, of course. And 
I invited you all here, thinking you might agree 
with me, and therefore could persuade her to send 
word to Santa Claus that she is ready to do the 
work.

the work, with my help.

goes quietly, you must remember. But I am just 
the one to help you, Father Gander and Mother

SimpLe Srwon. Why can’t I help? Old 
Santa doesn’t go down the chimney any longer,

Santa CLaus. Stuff and nonsense! That was

Kriss Kringle, and we are pretty good to him 
over there, too. We don’t expect him to scram- 
ble down a dark, smoky chimney. We put 
our wooden shoes out-of-doors where he can get 
at them easily. I’ll tell you a secret. (Puts

visitor known as the Habersock. A man or boy 
puts on a long cloak and a mask; then he carries 
an immense forked bough between the prongs of

along the way. To receive these gifts we place 
our shoes outside the doors and windows. We

Christmas Eve in even the poorest families a 
dozen candles are lighted, then the father tells 
stories of the glad Christmas time, until the can- 
dles burn out. On Christmas day the men call 
around among their friends and neighbors. They 
make no Christmas presents in Armenia except to 
the poor people and the children. So you see 
they have the best of it over there.

(Emity, Louisa, Mapen, Juia, Lucre dis-

busy with fancy-work.) 
Emity. Well, I must confess I shall be glad 
when Christmas is over. I have worked over 
these collar holders until I see them even when I 
close my eyes at night. 
Louise. No wonder if they are all as elaborate 
as that one. 
Emrty. Well, what would people think if I 
were to give them shabby little gifts ? 
Mase. Yes, that’s the way with all of us. 
“What will people think” enters so largely into 
all our Christmas giving. 
Jutta. Oh, Mabel, you are not making that 
pretty hair-receiver because of what people will 
think. 
\werr That is just what she is doing it for. 
Her aunt always sends her a pretty gift, and she

doesn’t want her to think that she is stingy and 
forgetful, so she will send her that dainty hair- 
receiver. 
Emi1ty (sighing deeply). Well, I hope your 
aunt will not be so unlucky as I was last Christmas. 
I received ten hairpin-holders of as many different 
shades of blue. - My room is blue, you know. 
Jutta. Oh, Emily, that’s hard to believe, ten 
different shades of blue! : 
Eminy. It’s the truth. I didn’t suppose that 
there were so many different shades of that color. 
But the pretty trifles, for they are pretty, are 
there to speak for themselves. I put them into a 
box to give away this Christmas. (Addl exclaim.) 
Well, what can Ido? I can’t hang them all up, 
for we haven’t ten blue rooms at our house. 
Luctzr. We are glad that she told us about it, 
girls. She cannot work them off on us. 
Maseru. But, seriously, girls, I for one am 
tired of the present custom of Christmas giving. 
Lovisr. Oh, now, Mabel, don’t mount the 
pulpit. I notice you were just as pleased to be 
remembered as any of us last year. 
Maset. Indeed I was, but a five cent card 
gave me as much pleasure as Emily received from 
her ten hairpin-holders. 
Jura. Judging from Emily’s remarks how 
delighted you must have been over that card! 
(Laughter.) 
Emity. Oh! of course you all laugh, but the

matter is becoming very serious. Last year I 
spent exactly ten dollars on Christmas presents, 
yet I didn’t send one person a gift costing over 
ten cents: outside of my labor, and I received in 
return a lot of dust catchers that I didn’t need, 
and often didn’t know what to do with. 
Lucir. Such as hairpin-holders! (Lavghter.) 
Maset. And if you had taken that ten 
dollars -—— 
Louise (interrupting with mock air of superi- 
ority). And given it to some worthy family. 
Maset. Now don’t make fun, Louise. I do 
wish we could do some really practical work for 
Christmas. 
Louisr. Well, it’s too late this year. I’ve 
spent all of my shekels for embroidery silk, lace, 
ribbons and other fripperies. 
Lucre. You speak of ribbons; I hope you are 
not about to enter upon the hairpin-holder industry. 
LouisE. No, indeed, but some people will open 
their eyes wide, when they discover the really 
beautiful things that I can make. 
GRACE (enters R.; comes to others). Well, well, 
how busy we all are. I went to your house, 
Emily, and your mother said you were at Julia’s, 
but I didn’t expect to find the rest of youhere. I 
am so fortunate—(drops into a chair) and tired.

Jutta. Why, that’s treason, not to have any 
work at Christmas time. 
Luor. And yet you complained a moment 
ago of being tired. 
MILY. What have you been about the last 
day or two? Every time that I called at your 
house, your mother always said “ out ” and didn’t 
vouchsafe an explanation as to where you were. 
Gracr. That’s just what I want to talk to you 
about, and I am so glad you girls are all here. 
You know the little shoemaker who has that box 
of a shop on Main Street ? 
Lovisx. Yes, some people call him the 
“tipsy shoemaker.” 
Grace. He never was that way until his wife 
and little boy died, two years ago, within a week 
of each other. 
Jutta. Yes, I believe I’ve heard that before. 
I remember the Christmas after his wife and child 
died; he began acting badly soon after and— 
and —— 
Grace. Yes, and so every one has just left 
him alone in his misery. 
Louis. And are you trying to reform him ? 
GRACE (rising excitedly). No; but, girls, it 
seems he has a sister who is a widow with one 
little boy, and he and the sister have been trying 
for a year to save money enough to bring her here 
so that she can make a home for him, and keep

him comfortable and—straight, you know. So 
the business men have made up a purse and sent 
it to her ; she is to arrive the day before Christmas 
and I thought it would be nice |for some of us 
girls to take our Christmas money, hire a woman 
to clean up the house, and 
Louisr. Dear me! Id just love to do it, 
but I’ve spent every cent of my money. 
Maseu. I’m glad I have a little left. Id like 
nothing better than to help fix his house all up, 
buy some new curtains and so on. 
Gracr. That’s what I thought. The grown 
people are to provide the Christmas dinner and it 
does seem as if we girls might help in some way. 
Lovisx. There! Mabel, how soon your wish 
is realized ; here is some practical Christmas work. 
Emity (rising and stuffing her work into bag). 
Yes, and I’m done making foolish trinkets ; my 
purse and time are yours, Grace. (Strikes an 
attitude. Laughter.) 
Louise (repeating Eminy’s business). My 
purse is empty. but my time is yours. But, 
wait; Pll ask the folks to give me the money 
that they were to spend on my Christmas gifts. 
Why, think of it! there will be enough to buy the 
little shoemaker a rocking-chair. 
Grace. Which is something he doesn’t possess 
now. You never saw so forlorn a place. One 
can scarcely wonder that he goes to the saloon for 
comfort. (All rise hurriedly und put away work.)

Grace. Oh, did you? How did you know 
where to send it ? 
Eminy. I didn’t know for sure, but I put on 
the envelope in my very best writing, “To Dear

it to our postman; fe knows where everybody 
lives.

one Santa Claus. 
Grack (shaking her head and rocking fast). 
No, no, there are two of them. 
Emity. I never heard of such a thing. Who 
told you that ? 
GRACE (slowly). Well, no one told me just 
exactly that, but you know the other day you 
said he would bring me just what I wanted if ’d 
write him a letter. 
Emtty. So he will; he has everything in his 
house that anybody can want, and he’s awfully 
rich—the richest person in the world, I guess. 
Grace. I know that’s what you told me 
before, but when I said to my papa, “Santa 
Claus is awfully rich, Emily ‘said so,” he laughed. 
Then he said, “ Well, maybe hers is, but ours is 
poor enough, I ’sure you ;” so don’t you see there 
must be two of ’em ? 
Emity. Maybe that’s so. I never thought of 
that before. 
Grace. And wouldn’t it be just awful if your 
letter should go to the poor Santa Claus ? 
Eminy. Oh, my! wouldn’t it? TI believe I'll 
write another one and put “To the rich Santa 
Claus ” on the envelope. i 
Grace. You can’t; it’s too late now. He’s 
all hitched up and started by this time. 
Emiry. That’s so. (Sighs.) Well, just hope

reason our washerwoman’s little girl never gets 
much for Christmas ? 
GrRacr. Doesn’t she? 
Emity. No. She told me this morning that 
Santa didn’t bring her a thing last Christmas but 
a stick of candy. 
Grace. Maybe she isn’t a good little girl ? 
Emity. Oh, but she is; she’s better’n I am. 
When I told mamma about it she said, “ P’rhaps 
Santa’s presents ran out before he got to her 
house, and we’d have to try to make it up to her 
this year.” 
Grace. So that shows there must be two 
Santas, ’cause the rich one’s presents couldn’t ever 
run out. 
Emiry. That’sso. Oh, dear! I amso worried 
for fear that my letter has gone to the wrong one. 
Did you write a letter, Grace ? 
Gracre. No, I thought there was no use, be- 
cause papa said our Santa Claus was poor.

yours. ‘

thing.

Curistmas Sprrit. No, dear. I am some- 
thing better than Santa Claus. I am the Christ- 
mas Spirit. I was born with the dear Christ Child 
in the lowly manger. On the anniversary of his 
birth I go forth to strengthen and purify the 
hearts of all people who will receive me. I bring 
good will to men, making those who welcome me 
kind, loving and patient with all the world, and 
grateful to the good Father above for all his 
benefits. 
Eminy. Can every one see you when you 
come ? 
CuristTMas Sprrit. Yes, unless their eyes are 
covered with the thick veils of pride, envy and 
selfishness; to such I am ever invisible. But 
to you, dear little girls, I come with my blessing, 
and now since you have seen me you cannot be

Forgotten are we all, when our bright bloom

MISTRESS OF GARDEN (coming forward). 
Not so, your memory lives within my “ heart

I seem to see you stand in beautiful array ; 
Oh, gentle spirits, linger! Ever near me stay. 
(Enter SNow SPRITE, R.; music ceases, and 
Sprrits or Flowers huddle together at c.) 
Snow Spritz. Oh, spirits so beautiful, you 
cling together in fear. But wherefore? I could 
not harm you if I would, since you are but spirits, 
and I would not if I could. You should not feel 
unkindly toward me. You have had your day. 
Can you not let me have mine ? 
MistRESS OF GARDEN. But you cannot give 
to me what these gentle flowers have given. 
There is neither beauty nor sweetness in your 
touch. 
Snow Sprite. My friend, you make a sad 
mistake ; each snowdrop that I send is a thing of 
wondrous beauty, as you will discover if you will 
examine it closely. Besides, I will cover these 
unsightly bushes and walks with a mantle of 
beauty, which, while it may possess no fragrance, 
is purer than any other earthly thing. 
Mistress oF GARDEN. That may be true, but 
you are cold, so cold. (Shivers.)

Cold, cold, oh, so cold, poor snow, 
Nought beneath your touch can grow. 
(They shiver and draw more closely together.) 
Snow Sprite. But there is one thing which 
you all seem to have forgotten. I bring with me 
the greatest earthly gift, the Christ Child. 
Au. True, true. 
Snow Spritz. Though there may be in some 
places some flowers blooming on Christmas Day, 
yet it is not when they are in the height of their 
glory and beauty that we keep his natal day. No, 
but when the winter reigns, when the nights are 
long, and when I am the ruler of the sky and do 
the best I can in every zone, than do we celebrate 
the coming of the Lord. 
MISTRESS OF GARDEN. But my heart is sad 
in thinking of that day. When all others are 
merry, I alone am sad. I am _ not sad in the 
summer time with my flowers about me ; they help 
me to forget my lonely heart and all my crosses. 
Snow Sprite. Surely the blessed Christ Child 
should help you to do this also. Were it not for 
his coming would even the flowers in their loveli- 
ness be able to cheer your heart? Does not all 
that we have and are centre about the blessed 
Child in the manger ? 
MisTREss OF GARDEN. Ah! dear Snow Sprite, 
you are right.

in garments of dazzling whiteness; every brown 
branch shall glisten with a million diamonds in 
honor of the coming of the Child of Bethlehem, 
and you, dear spirits of the flowers, shall still 
linger near the spots where buried deep in the 
earth your roots await the hastening spring.

We'll never be lonely, we’ll never be sad, 
But singing “ good will,” we’ll rejoice and be glad. 
Yes, Christmas is coming, the Snow Sprite will

The garden so brown a white mantle shall wear ; 
Then rejoice, oh, rejoice, “ good will’s ” in the air. 
‘Weep not for the flowers, they’ll come in the

you must bear other people’s burdens in this way.

THE RAIL-SPLITTER 
(A Lincoln Day Dialogue for Four Boys) 
CHARACTERS.—SNIP, the tailor, short and slight 
o figure; JOHN and Tom, two country boys,— 
Tom much the smaller of the two; ABn, the 
rail-splitter, very tall and long-limbed, rugged 
features resembling as much as possible the young 
Lincoln. 
CostuMES.—SnIP, the tailor, cheap suit, no coat. 
JouN and Tom, working outfit of farmer boys, 
overalls, etc. ABE, the rail-splitter, cheap suit 
of “store clothes,” much outgrown, short as to 
arms and legs. 
ScenE.—IJnterior of small tailor shop, pictures of 
men’s costumes on wall, one or two completed 
suits disposed conspicuously on large table at 
rear, rolls of cloth on same table. Smaller table 
at centre on which tailor sits cross-legged, a 
“goose” and other appurtenances of his trade 
beside him. Be careful to have everything in 
the scene in keeping with the time and place. 
(Snip is discovered industriously sewing on vest.) 
Snip. I declare this new country is a hard 
place for a man like me. I suppose I ought never 
to have come, but I will have a fine farm when it 
is once improved. It is a hard problem though to

do it, when so few people want new clothes, and 
those who do want them and get them make me 
wait so long for my pay. But what else can I do 
but make clothes ? These arms (pushes up sleeve 
and looks at arm) will never fence that farm, 
and if I don’t get it fenced there is small 
use of planting crops. Heigho! it is surely:a dis- 
couraging situation. 
(Enter JOHN, R., noisily.) 
Joun. Hello, Mr. Snip; have you seen my 
friend Tom about town ? 
Snip (without looking up). No, how should I 
see him? I have no business with him, nor he 
with me. 
JOHN (sarcastically). I thought he might come 
in for a suit of clothes, you know. (Snip shrugs 
shoulders contemptuously.) Oh, I say, yonder’s a 
pretty good-looking suit. (Goes up to table, picks 
up coat and examines it.) Now, how much would 
you charge me for a suit like that ? 
Snip (drops his work and looks up). Do you 
really want a new suit of clothes ? 
JOHN (still handling suit). IndeedIdo. That 
one you made me over a year ago is getting too 
small for me; makes me look as if I am wearing 
my little brother’s clothes. Dad says he can’t af- 
ford another, but I know better. 
Syip (aside). Vve a good notion to tell him 
that his father hasn’t yet paid for the one he has,

(Zlesitates.) No. I have a better plan than that. 
(Zo Joun.) Tl tell you, young fellow, if you 
really need a new suit, and I am sure you do, if 
you’ve had that other one so long, I can make 
an arrangement with you so that it will not cost 
your father a cent. 
JOHN (drops swit on table, and comes down). 
You don’t mean to say you'll make me a present 
of one? 
Snip (aside). Listen to the cheek of that; not 
satisfied with beating me out of one suit he ex- 
pects me to give him another. (Zo Joun.) No, 
indeed, I don’t intend to give you a suit, but I 
very much want some rails split with which to 
fence my farm that I’ve bought just outside the 
town, and if you

too. good a joke. Expect me to split rails to pay 
for my own suit. (ZLaughs.) Why, what’s the 
use of having a dad, if you have to do things like 
that ? 
Syrp. But you work on your father’s farm, 
don’t you? 
Joun. Well, yes, a little; drag, now and then, 
plant corn and potatoes when I can’t get out of it, 
and light work like that, but I never split a rail in 
my life; father hired every one of his split. 
Syrp. He did, eh? Well, you ought to be 
ashamed to tell of it. You certainly look strong 
enough to split every rail your father needs,  
-P-A-G-E-77

JoHN (angrily). I do,eh? Well, I just tell 
you now, little Billy Snip, you needn’t think be- 
cause you’re not more than half a man yourself 
that every one who has a few more inches than 
you intends to kill himself over the work that his 
father can afford to hire done ? 
Snip (scornfully). Well, if your father has so 
much money to use, why doesn’t he buy you the 
suit of clothes that you need so much ? 
JOHN (loftily). I presume he will when I ask 
him for it. 
Syrp. Oh, indeed! Well, then, while you’re in 
the asking humor, suppose you ask him just to 
pay me for the suit you already have and which 
you say you have outgrown. Outgrown before it 
is paid for! Just think of that, will you? (An- 
grily.) 
JoHN (coming close to Snip, shaking his fists). 
Ihave a good notion to knock youdown. T’d ——

Joun (angrily). Are you coming, Tom ? 
Tom. No, not until I find out what’s the row. 
Syrp. Oh! there’s no row, but I proposed to 
your stalwart friend, John, that, as he says he is in 
need of a new suit of clothes, he split rails enough 
for me to pay for a suit, and he was so mad at 
the things I said that he was just about to spin 
me off my shelf when you came in and saved the 
day. (Reswmes work.) 
Tom. Why, John, I’m surprised at you. Mr. 
Snip has always been a peaceable sort. Anyway, 
why don’t you take his offer? Julius Cesar! 
don’t I wish I was big enough and strong enough ? 
Id take that chance in a minute. 
Joun. If you don’t come right away, Tom, I’ll 
go without you. (Aszde.) If I leave him here 
without me it would be just like that mean little 
Snip to tell him all about the debt. (Zo Tom.) 
Come on, I say. 
Tom (going). Well, good-day, Mr. Snip. Maybe 
yowll not get your farm all fenced before I get 
big enough to accept your offer. (As Tom reaches 
R. entrance ABE enters. They all exchange pleas- 
ant good-mornings. Tom, aside to John, look- 
ing after ABE as he comes down.) Now, there’s 
a fellow that can split the rails. My! if I only had 
his inches and his muscle. 
JOHN (aside to Tom). Yes, and there can be no 
question of his needing the clothes. Maybe you’d 
like the outfit, too ?

These are good-looking clothes ; just the kind I’d 
like, but they are too small for me, you perceive. 
(Stretching trousers as men do when measur- 
ang.) 
Snip (throwing down work and speaking 
eagerly). Let me ask you, Mr. Lincoln, did you 
ever split rails ? 
ABE (drawlingly). Wal, I guess so. 
Snip. I tell you what I'll do. Tl make asuit 
of clothes better than that, out of the best cloth 
on the table over there, fine enough for the presi- 
dent himself, if you will split rails enough to pay 
for the suit. 
ABE (thoughtfully). Fine enough for the presi- 
dent himself. (Chuckles.) That wouldn’t be bad. I 
can imagine I am the president then, I suppose. 
(Stands silent a moment.) How many rails do you 
want for the clothes, Mr. Snip ? 
Snip. Well, you know you're a pretty big 
fellow. 
ABE (laughing). Can’t deny it. 
Syrp. So I’ve thought that for every yard of 
cloth put into the clothes, you must split me one 
hundred rails. 
ABE. That covers the cost of everything ?
-P-A-G-E-80

Snip. Yes, sir, and they’ll be made according 
to the very latest New York styles. 
Ase. All right, Mr. Snip ; in less than an hour 
I will be at the rails. Good-morning. 
(Zvit, R. Enter JOHN, R.) 
Joun. By the way, Mr. Snip, I’ve been asking 
my father about that debt. He says he’ll pay it 
after potato harvest, and I’ve about made up my 
mind that I’ll tackle that little job of rail splitting. 
Snip. Too late, my boy, too late. I have just 
engaged Mr. Lincoln to do the work. I think he 
will furnish all the rails that I shall need. 
Joun. Well, I must say you wound the thing 
up in a hurry. 
Snrp. Yes, Abe is that kind of a fellow. He’s 
the right sort, he is. He’s bound to get to the 
top, I tell you. Maybe he’ll land in the “ White 
House.” Who knows? 
Joun. Oh, go off. Abe Lincoln in the White 
House! Pretty figure he’d cut. 
Snrp. Never you mind, he’ll fit it all right, 
and then you, and thousands like you, will come 
coaxing around for a nice soft job for old times’ 
sake.

made him a suit of clothes once, and made it well.

  SOME FAMOUS DATES 
(A Lincoln Day exercise for fourteen) 
CHARAOTERS.—UNCLE Sam, CoLuMBIA, 
TWELVE Dates, represented by either boys or 
girls. 
CostumEs.—UNCLE Sam, typical national cos- 
tue, too well known to need description. Co- 
LumBIA, long white dress, American flag 
draped across same. Boys, plain black suits, 
small flags in buttonhole. GIRLS, white dresses, 
red, white and blue ribbons. 
GenERAL Drrections.—A large chair on a 
draped dais is placed at each end of stage. At 
left rear of stage stands a wooden arch with 
Lincoln’s picture in the centre. The arch is 
decorated with evergreens and upon its front, 
at regular intervals, are placed twelve nails. 
Each child carries a square of pasteboard on 
which a date is plainly printed. As he, or she, 
recites the prescribed lines, the card is hung on 
the proper nail, the speaker then takes a place on 
aline with the arch, following in regular order 
as the speeches are given.

Cotumpra. Now, you must admit, Sammie, 
83
-P-A-G-E-82
  84 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
my dear, that you never were very good in dates 
and so —— 
Uncite Sam (énterrupting, angrily). Never 
was good in dates? Don’t I know this continent 
was discovered in 1492 and that we set up house- 
keeping in 1776? What else does a man need 
to know? Just answer me that, will you ? 
CoLumsia. Do you mean that nothing of 
much consequence has happened since those two 
important dates ? 
UNcLE Sam (putting his hands under his coat- 
tails and strutting about). That’s about the size 
of it, Columby. 
CoLumpia. Oh, Sammy, Sammy, what an ar- 
rogant, narrow-minded old party you are. But 
just to show you how little you know about the 
matter after all, I have prepared some special 
dates for you to study. They will be in here 
presently and I want you to give them your —— 
UncLte Sam (interrupting impatiently). Oh, 
bother the dates, Columby ; you’d better let them 
alone; they’ll surely upset your digestion. By the 
way, didn’t I give you a little job of your own, 
long ago? Don’t you remember how you came 
to me with a pitiful story because they sing about 
you with the song that belongs to Great Britain ? 
Didn’t you say that you wanted a brand new song 
all your own, and that it gave you a pain in your 
hea t when they took out the word “ Britannia,” 
and put in the word “Columbia,” and, without
-P-A-G-E-83

another single change, called the song an “ Amer- 
ican, national air”? And didn’t you vow, too, 
that you’d have a song of your own by hook or by 
crook? Where is it, Columby ? Let’s hear it ; 
trot it out, trot it out. 
CotumBia. Yes, I did say all that and more 
too, I presume, but the reason I haven’t found my 
national song about which I have dreamed and 
dreamed, is just this. The eyes of the people are so 
fixed on that great pile of sand called “ money- 
getting,” that they cannot see the gredt and glo- 
rious thing that our country really is. These dates 
that I am bringing to you, Sammy dear, are 
coming for this very purpose, to inspire the hearts 
of our youth with the greatness of the men that 
have made our country. By and by if we present 
these pictures often enough, long enough and 
strong enough, the true love for our beautiful land 
will strike somewhere deep enough to bring forth 
from its roots the great national hymn for which 
Iam watching. So now, Sammy dear, up into the 
chair, and watch and study the dates as they 
come. Who knows, perhaps even in your world- 
locked old heart a throb of true patriotism may 
yet spring into life ? Come, now, into your chair 
with you; the procession is about due now. (As 
UnoLe Sam seats himself, aside to audience.) 
What would ever become of him, do you suppose, 
if it were not for me? Uncle Sam may be all

then, from Madam Columbia herself to keep him 
on the level. 
(Patriotic music. E1igHTrEN HuNDRED AND 
NINE enters 8. COLUMBIA sits in her chair.) 
1809. Eighteen hundred and nine am I and 
proud indeed am I to say to you that under my 
date on February 12th Abraham Lincoln was born 
in Hardin County, Kentucky. His father was an 
early settler and the struggle for existence was 
hard. Thus Lincoln’s early life knew only the most 
abject poverty. There was, indeed, nothing in 
the surroundings of the barefoot boy to foretell 
the place which he now occupies in the heart of 
the nation. 
1816. Eighteen hundred and sixteen am I, and 
during my days the Lincoln family embarked on 
a raft on Salt River, sailed down to the Ohio 
River and thence to Indiana, where they landed 
and settled in Spencer County which was then a 
wilderness. Here he was taught by his mother, 
whose maiden name was Nancy Hanks, to read 
and write. She died when he was ten years old, 
and two years later his father married a widow, 
Mrs. Johnson, who encouraged young Lincoln in 
his desire for an education. 
1828. I am eighteen hundred and twenty 
eight, and I saw young Lincoln, then a tall lad 
of nineteen, sail down the Mississippi River as a 
flat boatman with the son of theaman who owned
-P-A-G-E-85
  
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 87 
the boat. It bore a valuable cargo, and, on one 
occasion, they were attacked by a band of robbers 
and were forced to fight for the safety of the 
property entrusted to them. Lincoln made two 
voyages to New Orleans on the flatboat during 
my days. 
1830. Eighteen hundred and thirty, I mark the 
second removal of the Lincoln family, this time to 
Decatur, Illinois. Here young Lincoln helped 
split the rails to fence his father’s farm. It is also 
said of him that here he split rails to pay for a 
suit of clothes, one hundred rails for every yard of 
cloth. It was this incident that won for him the 
soubriquet, “ The Rail-splitter.” 
1832. I am 1832. In my time broke out the 
conflict known as the “Black Hawk War,” so 
named from the chief of the Sac and Fox tribes 
who conducted it. It was caused by the efforts of 
the United States government to drive across the 
Mississippi the Indian tribes lingering in Illinois 
and Wisconsin. Lincoln was captain of a com- 
pany of volunteers, but although he went to the 
seat of war he saw no fighting, as hostilities ceased 
soon after his enlistment. On his return from the 
war, he opened a store, was appointed postmaster 
and studied hard. He became a good surveyor 
and for two years made surveying his chief busi- 
ness. 
1834, I am 1834 and while I lasted Lincoln 
was elected to the Illinois state legislature. He
-P-A-G-E-86
  88 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
had run before, but although polling a heavy vote 
was defeated. When he returned from the legis- 
lature he took up the study of law. He was ad- 
mitted to the bar when twenty-eight years of age, 
and soon won a lucrative practice and a reputa- 
tion as aready and witty speaker. He served a 
second term in the legislature, ranking as a Whig 
of the Henry Clay school. 
1846. In my days, 1846, Mr. Lincoln was sent 
to Congress from his adopted state, and was its 
only Whig representative. His career in Con- 
gress was marked by soundness of judgment and 
attachment to the principles of justice and right 
He was a decided but conservative anti-slavery man. 
1858. It was during my times, 1858, that Mr. 
Lincoln first won a more than local reputation. 
He was the Republican candidate for the United 
States Senate in opposition to Stephen A. Doug- 
las, the Democratic candidate, who had won a 
national reputation as an orator. The candidacy 
of these two men brought about a series of de- 
bates remarkable for the thoroughness with which 
the agitating questions of the time were discussed. 
Lincoln was defeated by Douglas, but was placed 
in line for nomination for President by the Re- 
publican party. 
1860. I am the year 1860 that saw Abraham 
Lincoln elected to the presidency of the United 
States, over three competitors, Douglas, Breckin- 
ridge and Bell. Quickly following Lincoln’s elec-
-P-A-G-E-87
  ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 89 
tion, on December 20th of this year, South Caro- 
lina seceded from the Union. Other states fol- 
lowed her example and when Lincoln took the 
oath of office in the ensuing spring, he found him- 
self President of a divided nation with a disastrous 
war threatening them. 
1863. A great event happened in my days, 
1863. On January 1st of this year Abraham Lin- 
coln issued what is known as the Emancipation 
Proclamation. It announced that after January 1, 
1863, all slaves were declared free in states which 
had not returned to the Union. As none of the 
seceding states returned to their allegiance by that 
time, slavery was thus practically abolished. 
1864. My days, 1864, saw Lincoln reélected 
President of the United States. It also saw some 
attempts toward peace negotiations, but these 
came to nothing. Lincoln’s policy was con- 
demned by many leading Republicans and at one 
time his renomination seemed very doubtful. 
After his death a memorandum in his writing was 
found among his papers which ran thus, “This 
morning (August 23d), as for some time past, it 
seems exceedingly probable that this administra- 
tion will not be reélected.. Then it will be my 
duty to so codperate with the President-elect as 
to save the Union between the election and in- 
auguration, as he will have secured his election on 
such grounds that he cannot possibly save it af 
terward.”
-P-A-G-E-88

1865. My date, 1865, surely needs to be draped 
in mourning, since it saw the assassination on 
April 14th of one of the noblest patriots our coun- 
try has ever known, as the words just quoted 
show. To save the Union at any cost to himself 
was the predominating passion of his life. 
AL. “ With malice toward none, with charity 
for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us 
to see the right, let us strive to finish the work 
we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds, to 
care for him who shall have borne the battle and 
for his widow and orphan, to do all which may 
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace 
among ourselves and with all nations.”

ist SPEAKER. We here celebrate the birth- 
day of one who has been called the second great 
American leader, as Jackson was the first. Lincoln 
was, like Jackson, fully representative of the 
American people, because he was raised by the 
American ranks, from the ranks, above the ranks, 
to represent their spirit and impulses. In no way 
then can we more fitly honor this great Ameri- 
can than by reciting for you a few of his most 
celebrated utterances.

to some extent, but human nature cannot be 
changed.”

upon this continent a new nation conceived in 
liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all

It will become all one thing or all the other.” 
ivtH SPEAKER. “With malice toward none, 
with charity for all, with firmness in the right as 
God gives us to see the right, let us do all which

noble man’s utterances, but read his words for

CostumEs.—Kine VALENTINE, long white 
robe edged with ermine. The latter may be 
cheaply imitated by strips of Canton flannel 
splashed with large spots of ink. Upon this robe

red paper. A pasteboard crown covered with

ATTENDANTS. Elaborate gowns and suits. 
ScrenE.—Handsome interior. 
Sucexrstions.—The roll carried by 1st Page 
must be about eighteen inches wide and thick 
enough to make it an inconvenient burden. It 
must be covered with writing, and must be 
Frequently dropped with an impetus that causes 
at to roll several feet away, the further the bet- 
ter. In the proper hands these rolls of paper 
give an opportunity for some very funny “ busi- 
ness.” ° 
(ist PaGE enters R., carrying immense roll of 
paper as described above. 2D PaGk enters L. 
As they meet at c., the bundle of paper drops 
and rolls off across the stage.) 
2p Paar. What in the world is that ? 
ist PaGE (while rescuing roll). That is the
-P-A-G-E-93
  ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 95 
list of names that we are to look up. Hadn’t you 
heard about it? (2p PaaE shakes head.) Well, 
the Lord High Chamberlain told me to give part 
of it to the first page that I ran across, so that 
means you. (Zears off about one-third, rolls up 
smaller portion and tucks it under his arm while 
talking. Presents larger piece at close of speech.) 
These people are all to be looked up just as 
rapidly as we can do it, and I just tell you we 
haven’t any time to waste. Here, take your 
share. 
2p Pager. No, thank you, I don’t want that 
big piece. 
isr Pace. But you must take it. Don’t you 
remember that’s the law at the court of King 
Valentine—to do whatever you are told, and ac- 
cept everything that is handed to you? (Drops. 
larger paper ; it rolls toward 2D PAg@e.) 
2p Paes. Yes, that is true; I had forgotten. 
But don’t you think you are taking an unfair ad- 
vantage of that law when you give me so many 
names and keep so few yourself ? 
ist Pager. Well, I declare, how funny you 
are. Who ever heard of a boy complaining be- 
cause he is getting the larger share of anything ? 
2p Paar. Oh, come now, you know that de- 
pends. 
ist Pace. No use of talking; you'll just have 
to take it. But you want to work off the bigger 
piece on the next page you meet.
-P-A-G-E-94
  96 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
2p PaGE (kicking at paper on floor). But 
what's all this for, anyway ? 
1st Pacer. Well, Sir Cupid has become se 
intolerably particular he has decided not to have 
any missives sent out this St. Valentine’s Day 
except to people who have more money than they 
can spend, and we pages have been given the task 
of looking up all the names on the list to see who 
shall be honored and who shall not. (Zaking up 
paper and rolling it up.) 
2p Paer. That is a queer move. Does King 
Valentine know about it ?» 
1st Pacr. I don’t know; but as I received 
my orders from the Lord High Chamberlain him- 
self, one would suppose that Sir Cupid had brought 
the King over to his way of thinking. 
2p Pace. Well, I should think the King might 
have a little mind of his own. 
ist Pacer. That’s just what he has, a little 
mind of his own, and a very little one it is too, so 
little that there are times when it can hardly be 
found. But I hear some one coming; another 
page, maybe. Now’s your chance. . 
(Throws larger roll at him and exit .., running ; 
paper runs across stage. Enter LADY CHEER- 
FUL, R.; comes down.)

Cheerful (profound bow), I thought it was one 
of the pages. 
Lapy CHEERFUL (amgrily). What do you 
mean? Do you realize to whom you are 
speaking ? 
2p Pace (bowing low). Indeed I do; it is 
Lady Cheerful, the favorite maid of honor to her 
Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, but her footsteps 
were so light that I thought it was one of the 
little pages who run about in their kid slippers. 
(Rescues paper and rolls it up.) 
Lapy CHEERFUL (smiling). Oh, it’s of no 
consequence ; we are all liable to make mistakes ; 
but what in the world are you doing with that 
great roll of paper? _ 
2p Pacr. This, my lady,,is the list of people 
that we pages are to investigate. 
Lapy Currrrut. Let -me see it. (Pace 
hands it.) Investigate for what ? 
2p Paar. To discover to whom missives shall 
be sent from the court of King Valentine. 
Lapy CHEERFUL. Investigate? Who ever 
heard of such a thing? What are you to in- 
vestigate, I should like to know ? : 
2p Paar. We are to discover the people who 
have more money than they can spend. 
Lapy CuHrEerruL. What rank nonsense! By 
whose orders is this being done ? 
2p Page. By the order of Sir Cupid himself.  
-P-A-G-E-96

Lapy CHrErrrut. I always said he had ne 
common sense, and this proves it. But nothing of 
the kind shall be done. (Tears list.) 
2p PaGwT (aside). Well, I slipped out of that 
job easily. (Zo Lapy CHEERFUL.) But aren’t 
you just a little afraid that you are making trouble 
for yourself ? 
Lapy CHEERFUL (with dignity). In what way, 
I should like to know ? 
2p Pace. Sir Cupid is pretty powerful here, 
you know, and if he has the consent of the King 
Valentine and the Queen of Hearts, they might 
be angry at your—your—well, your interference. 
Lapy CHrErrruL. That might be if they are 
a party to this nonsense, but I feel sure the whole 
thing is done without their knowledge. (Lively 
music behind scenes.) There! they are coming 
now, and we will soon get at the truth of the 
matter. Better gather up your papers. 
(2p Pace picks up papers and makes them into 
one roll, which he tucks under his arm, goes to 
L.F. Enter, R., KING VALENTINE, QUEEN OF 
Huarts and train of attendants. Kine and 
QUEEN stand at ©., attendants group carelessly.) 
Kine (sees Pace). See here, youngster, this 
ought to be your busy day. Be off, now. (PaGE 
starts to run, drops roll with usual result.) What’s 
that ?

speaks. PAGE continues “ businecs” of rescuing 
papers, rolling up and dropping them until the 
close of the third speech of the QUEEN OF 
Hearts; he then tucks the roll under his arm.) 
Lapy CHEERFUL. May I ask a question of 
your Majesties ? 
Kine. Yes, indeed. 
QuerEN. Half a dozen if you like. 
Lapy CHEERFUL. To whom are the missives 
to be sent this year? 
QurEN. Have you so soon forgotten the law 
of the land ? 
Kine. They go to every human being over 
four years and under a hundred who holds at 
least one being supremely dear. Their names, 
you remember, are all down in the big court 
books. 
Lapy CHEERFUL. But does the list never need 
revising ? 
QuEEN. Oh, yes, but the Lord High Chamber- 
lain sees to that. 
' Kine. Now, boy, since you have rolled your 
papers up, suppose you tell us what is on them. 
2p Paes. If you please, your Majesty, this is 
a list of names that we are to investigate. 
Kina. Investigate? For what?

more money than they can spend.

Lapy Curerrut. This is one of Sir Cupid’s 
innovations. (Aside to Paan.) I told you they 
knew nothing about it. 
QUEEN (to attendants). Bring in Sir Cupid. 
But put a cloak about him, for the air is chilly to- 
day, and he is always so cross when he is cold: 
(Exeunt two attendants, R.) 
Kine. That is a good thought to send for 
him ; it will not only give him a chance to explain 
his strange action, but give us a chance to reprove 
him for breaking a time-honored law of this court. 
More money than they can spend, indeed! Asif 
that had anything to do with our plans. (A song 
may be sung here by any one of the company who 
as called on by the QUEEN. At close of song enter 
rR. Str Cuprp between two attendants. Kine, 
severely.) What is this that I hear about you, 
Sir Cupid? Breaking the laws of the court in 
sending out messengers to investigate the financial 
standing of mortals before you will allow them to 
receive one of our missives? Is this true? 
Srr Cupip (saueily). Yes, it is true, but what 
are you going to do about it ? 
QuEEN. In other words, you young rascal, you 
mean to say that we cannot help ourselves ? 
Sir Cupip (bowing profoundly). You are al- 
ways right, your Majesty. 
QurEen. But you will find out, sir, thas you 
are not so powerful as you think. What could

you do, for instance, if robbed of your bow and 
arrows ? 
Str Cupip (bowing). You forget, your Majesty, 
that if you take these away I have the power to 
make others. 
Krye. But why not explain to us the reason 
for this strange action? for I am quite sure you 
have a reason. 
Str Cuprp. Indeed I have, your Majesty, and 
I can give it in one sentence. I am tired of flying 
out of the window. 
Kine 
QUEEN. Out of the window ? 
Lapy CHEERFUL. 
Sir Currp. Yes; don’t you remember how the 
proverb runs? “When poverty comes in at the 
door, love flies out of the window,” and I tell you 
Lam getting tired of it, no matter what the state 
of the weather, freezing cold, or boiling hot, out 
of the window I must fly, when Poverty shows her 
hideous face at the door. 
Kina (moving restlessly about). Very true, 
very true; it is rather hard on Cupid. 
QueEN. You silly boy, why do you fly out of 
the window? No one is to blame for that but 
yourself ; you do not have to go. 
Str Curr. But the proverb says so. 
QuEEN. Fiddlesticks! Who cares for an old 
saw? That isn’t alaw. Did you think it was ? 
(Str Cuprp nods.) Well, it isn’t, you see, so the

next time Poverty comes stalking in, just stand 
your ground like a man. 
Srr Cuprp (whimpering). But she is so ugly. 
Ugh ! how I hate her. (Shivers.) 
Krye. Tl tell you what to do, Sir Cupid ; hit 
her with one of your own arrows; that will make 
her beautiful in a twinkling. 
QuEEN. What a piece of folly is this! Our 
all powerful Cupid, who conquers everybody, is 
himself subdued by the ugly Poverty. (Music 
behind scenes.) Think about it, sweet boy, and 
assert yourself. (Zhey move off L.) 
Kine (looking back). At least we must have no 
more nonsense about financial investigations. 
(EZeeunt 1., all but StR Cuprp who stands at c., 
lost in thought. Lord HieH CHAMBERLAIN

CHAMBERLAIN. Why so pensive, Sir Cupid ? 
Srr Currp. Iam forbidden to send out the in 
vestigators. 
CHAMBERLAIN. Forbidden! By whom? 
Srr Currp. By their Majesties themselves. 
CHAMBERLAIN. And for what reasons ? 
Str Cuprp. They say it is contrary to the 
laws of this court. 
CHAMBERLAIN. Then let them make new 
laws. 
Str Curip. That is not to be thought of.
-P-A-G-E-101
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 103 
CHAMBERLAIN. Did you tell them how much 
you have suffered ? 
Str Cupip. Yes, but they only derided me, 
and bade me to cease being cowardly, and face 
Poverty boldly. King Valentine even suggested 
that I hit her with one of my arrows. 
CHAMBERLAIN (laughing). That would indeed 
be a new way to meet an old situation, but who 
knows ?—it might work. (Laughs.) 
(Enter 1st PAGE, L. ; comes down.) 
1st Page. Sir Cupid, I have discovered that 
the people on this list who meet your requirements 
do not meet the laws of this royal court, or, in 
other words, the only ones to whom you wish the 
court missives sent are the only ones to whom 
they cannot be sent. 
Sir Currp. That sounds like one of those 
foolish things called conundrums. © Is it one ? 
ist Paar. No, indeed; I only wish it were 
But you see, the people who have more money 
than they can spend are the very people who hold 
no one person supremely in their hearts, for they 
love their money better than all else. 
Sir Curr. Ah, yes! I see, I see. 
ist Paax. Have the others returned ? 
Str Cuprp. No one went but yourself. The 
investigation was forbidden by their Majesties. 
Give me your roll. (Gives it, and goes up.) 
CHAMBERLAIN. Sir Cupid, the more I think 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  104 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
of the advice given you in regard to Poverty, the 
more I am pleased with it and I trust you will 
follow it. 
Sir Cupp (crossing over). Oh, I fear I can 
never do it; the very sound of her voice puts me 
in a panic. 
CHAMBERLAIN. Nonsense! You must not be 
so chicken-hearted. (Whimpering ery heard be- 
hind scenes.) But hark, there she comes now. 
(Str Cuprp starts to run tL.) No one can mistake 
her cry. But come, you must not be a baby; 
come back, I say. (Str Cuprp slowly comes to o. 
Enter PovERTY, R. ; comes down without looking at 
Sir Cupp, who drops on one knee and takes wim 
with bow and arrow at Poverty. She turns 
about, sees his arrow and drops unconscious. 
Lively music. Enter B., with a rush, Kine, 
QUEEN, and attendants all exclaiming, “ What is 
it? What is going on?” Music ceases.) Don’t 
you see? Love has killed Poverty by simply 
pointing his weapon at her. 
Str Curr (rising, and putting away his arrow). 
Saved my arrow, too, for another purpose, and 
now I am ready to send the missives from the

CostumES.—Ordinary street suits. All carry

Scrnn.—The dressing-room of a girls’ school. 
Hats and wraps hung on hooks at rear. Small

MILDRED (enters R.). Dear me! how glad lam 
that no one is here. I found this letter at the 
post-office for me (takes at out of book) and I didn’t 
dare open it there, or on the street, because I just 
know it’s a comic valentine. (Laughter behind 
scenes ; secretes letter in book.) What fun they are 
having. Well, they’ll not have any over me. I 
don’t believe they are coming in here, after all. 
(Takes out letter.) Typewritten address. (Lays 
books she is carrying on table.) That’s a pretty 
sure sign that it’s a comic valentine. Oh, I know 
it is, because none of the girls seem to like me. 
I wonder why? I’m sure I’m the best dressed 
girl in school. I used to think before papa made 
all that money that if I wore fine clothes I would 
have loads of friends, but it doesn’t seem to make 
any difference. (Sighs.) Well, I may as well 
open this thing, although I just dread to. (Zears

there was a girl in the whole world who liked me 
well enough to send me anything sc pretty. 
(Reads.) 
As modest as the violet, 
As gentle as the breeze, 
These, little maid, the qualities 
That never fail to please. 
Well, well, well, I know I’m not as modest as the 
violet. I’m afraid that I love to brag the best of 
anything. I’m going right into the schoolroom to 
show my valentine. (Hangs up hat and wrap.) 
I wonder if they will be as much surprised as I 
was. “As modest as a violet,” just think of it. 
(Runs oft. Lucy enters R.) 
Lucy. That envelope looks like the one that I 
sent to Mildred. ((oes to table and takes tt up.) 
So it is. Id know that typewriting anywhere. 
T did it in such a hurry, because I expected papa’s 
stenographer in every moment. Yes, and there’s 
where I struck the e instead of the r in Mildred, 
and had to mark it over with the pen. Well, she 
has the valentine evidently, and will know now 
something of the way she looks to other people. 
I wonder where she is, and why she left the 
envelope lying here? Well, I feel quite relieved
-P-A-G-E-105
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 107 
to know that it reached her safely, because when 
I met Helen and gave her the letter to mail, after 
foolishly telling her what was in it, she preached 
me such a sermon against sending comic valentines 
that I was afraid she’d not mail it. I’d have 
taken it back then, but she ran off with it, and I 
couldn’t catch her.

valentine therein.) 
Lucy. But surely you didn’t get that valentine 
in that envelope ? 
MILDRED (mocking her). Surely I did get that 
valentine in that envelope. Why shouldn’t I? 
What’s the matter with the envelope ? 
HELEN (coming down). Mildred, didn’t Miss

ill manners to repeat people’s words and tones in 
that way ? 
Miuprep. Yes, Helen, but I always forget

I do wish I could have sweet and gentle manners 
like you. But I don’t believe I ever can; it

I intend to take these lines on my valentine for 
my motto: 
As modest as the violet, 
As gentle as the breeze. 
Don’t you think they will help me? 
Hern. Indeed they will, Mildred. 
Mitprep. I do wish I knew who sent me that 
valentine. I’d love to thank the girl that did it;

myself up to them some day.

Lucy (angrily). .1 believe I’ll run after her and 
tell her that you sent her that valentine. 
Heten. How do you know that I did? 
Lucy. How can I help knowing it? But I’d 
like to have you let my letters alone after this. 
How did you dare open it ? 
HELEN. Lucy, don’t be angry ; in your hurry 
you had forgotten to seal the envelope, so I simply 
slipped the comic valentine out and slipped the 
other one in. 
Lucy. But she deserves the other one, you 
know she does ; it described her exactly, with all 
her brag and bluster. Such a glorious opportunity 
to “hold the mirror up to nature.”

Heten. But don’t you think my method of 
showing her what she is not, and giving her a 
beautiful model to live up to will be quite as ef- 
fective? You heard what she said ? 
Lucy. Oh, yes, but that’s all talk; she will 
soon forget her good resolutions. 
Heten. But surely the impression will be as 
lasting as the one your comic valentine would 
have made? 
Lucy. Well, perhaps you are right. I believe 
Pll tell her all about it. 
Heten. Why should you? Why grieve her 
by telling the unkind thing you meant to do? 
Better let her be happy as she is. ‘ 
Lucy. There is one thing I will do. I will 
promise you never again to send a comic valen- 
tine, but will choose your better way of teaching 
a needed lesson. (Bell rings.)

Mr. Harcuer (enters R., comes down, struts 
about while talking). These people who rave 
over George Washington never seem to reflect 
how much of his fame he owes tome. He cut 
down the cherry-tree and then told the truth 
about it. But if it hadn’t been for me he wouldn’t 
have had anything handy with which to commit 
that awful deed. If he hadn’t committed that 
awful deed he wouldn’t even have thought of

telling the truth, so he would have gone on telling 
falsehoods to the end of his days, and so, of course, » 
could not have become the great and glorious 
Father of his Country. 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE (enters L., comes down). See 
here, Mr. Hatchet, I have heard your boasting,

Mr. Hatouet (haughtily). And pray who may 
you be?

Mr. CHERRY-TREE. Will you deny that you 
were talking when I came in? 
Mr. Hatcuer. Certainly not; but the great 
George Washington and my greater self were the 
only names mentioned in my discourse. 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE (sarcastically). Your 
greater self !

versed in the history of your country that you do 
not know what it owes to me?

Mr. CHERRY-TREE. Oh, yes. Oh—let me see 
—what was it that you did ? 
Mr. Hatcuer. Was there ever such ignorance 
known before? Z cut down the cherry-tree, and 
thus gave George Washington something to tell 
the truth about, and so immortalize his name. 
—Mr. CuEerRy-TREE. Then you think he would 
never have been heard of if it had not been for 
you, Mr. Hatchet ? 
Mr. Hatcuer. Certainly I do. It was my 
deed that gave him his first opportunity to distin- 
guish himself by telling the truth, and thus pave 
\the way for his future glory.

Hatchet, there is one thing that you seem to have 
forgotten; if there had been no cheery-tree, you 
could not have been used ; then, how about your 
wonderful deed? So wouldn’t it be wise for you 
to boast less? For J, let me tell you ore pro- 
foundly), am Mr. Cherry-tree. 
Mr. Hatcurt. Your impudence amazes me! 
Boast less, indeed, just because you were in the 
way and chanced to be cut down? Could not I 
have felled an oak sapling just as well ? 
Mr. CuHERRY-TREE. Perhaps so, but you for- 
get, Mr. Hatchet, that Mr. Washington, the father 
of poor little George, would scarcely have been 
angry over the destruction of an oak sapling, ef 
which~he, no~ doubt, had-too many. But his 
favorite cherry-tree! It was this which brought

the temptation to falsehood, and therefore, Mr. 
Hatchet, I again declare that the greater honor 
belongs to me, for 
Mr. Harcourt (interrupting angrily). Oh, 
come, come, this is too much. Why, sir 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE (interrupting). For, as I 
was saying, had any other tree than the cherry- 
tree been growing there, according —— 
Mr. Harouxt (goes up). I will not listen to 
you, sir. This is profanation, sir, outright prof- 
anation. 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE (calmly). According to 
your own very skilful reasoning (pauses; MR. 
Harcuer turns about and listens), Mr. Hatchet, if 
the cherry-tree had not been there 
Mr. Hatrouer (interrupting angrily). Drop 
that now, drop it, I say. 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE (quickly). This great and 
glorious country would never have known exist- 
ence, for there would have been no remarkable 
truth-telling George, and without him there could 
not have been founded “ the land of the free, and 
the home of the brave.” 
Mr. Harcner. Yes, not without the hatchet. 
Mr. CHERRY-TREE. You mean not without 
the cherry-tree. 
Mr. Hatounr (comes down shaking fist). I

song while doing so. At the close of first verse she

Tell me why we all rejoice, 
Merrily, with heart and voice, 
When the shining Spring is here, 
Best and dearest time of year.

*Tis just because the robin sings 
While he rests his tired wings, 
Telling us in language sweet 
All about his home complete. 
All about the small brown nest, 
Holding those he loves the best.

No, it is because the grass 
Shows itself where’er we pass. 
Green and smooth, each slender spear 
Seems to whisper, “ Spring is here.”

*Tis the dandelion’s gold 
Shining on the earth’s brown mold, 
Making all the world so bright 
That we wonder at the sight.

*Tis because the winter grim 
Bids us say “ good-bye ” to him. 
All his icy reign is o’er, 
He can nip with cold no more.

“ Welcome, welcome, merry Spring.”

Were it not the winter grim 
Held us long enslaved to him ? 
Were it Spring time all the year,

°Tis because the far-off sky, 
Looking at us from on high, 
Shows so warm and clear its blue 
Just like heaven shining through. 
Making angels seem so near, 
That is why the Spring’s so dear. 
{rH SPEAKER. 
No. I think the reason why 
Is that Easter Day is nigh. 
Jesus rose for you and me, 
This is why the Spring should be 
Dearer than all joyous times. 
Bells should ring in sacred chimes, 
Birds and sky and flowers be glad, 
Nothing gloomy, nothing sad, 
Everything should smile and say, 
“Welcome, welcome, Easter Day.”

You should choose me, then, for your glad

Nay, I should be the chosen flower 
To usher Easter in. 
“ Behold the lilies,” Jesus said, 
“They toil not, neither spin.” 
Thus did he bless my stately name, 
And crown me with undying fame. 
Now, who will dare dispute my claim ? 
(All the others.) 
More kindly words should mark the flower 
Who seeks to grace this holy hour. 
MAIDEN (carrying the violets behind her back 
now comes forward). I have been sitting con- 
cealed in yonder valley, and have listened as you 
proudly set forth your claims to be chosen as the 
Easter flower. You are all beautiful and you are 
all dear to mortal hearts. The Crocus because 
she comes forth even under the snow, and gives 
us the first hint of the glorious summer coming. 
The Daffodil for the same reason. She fears 
neither frost nor snow, nor the wild March winds, 
and you, too, Wake-Robin, you wave your white 
petals in the air and we say, Lo, the Spring is 
here. The Tulip stands with stately grace, adorn- 
ing every spot she touches, and nothing can be 
more beautiful than the Lily’s lofty grace, but, 
dear flowers, while I listened to your boastful 
words, a sweet fragrance stole over my senses. 
I heard no voice exclaiming, “ Take me, I am fair 
and lovely.” No, there was nothing but the

ALL. The violet, the violet. 
MAIDEN (showing flowers). Yes, and I brought

desses placed about. Characters are discovered

Fausta. How glad I am that you are with 
me this beautiful spring day, Julia, and how glad 
I am also of its coming at last ; are not you? 
Jutia. Yes; I have always loved the spring 
time more than all other seasons, but this year 
it has a charm that it never knew before. 
Fausta. Oh, indeed! That can mean but one 
thing, my Julia. I had not thought it of you; 
you are always so quiet and demure. Come, now, 
no blushing. ; 
Juma. I am not blushing. Why should I, 
indeed? Is it cause for blushing that I love the 
spring time? If so, then should my dear Fausta 
142
-P-A-G-E-141

also blush, for I think she said but a moment ago 
that she was glad of the spring time. 
Fausta. So am I; and oh, Julia, our spring 
feasts this year to the gods and goddesses are to 
outshine anything before attempted. We will go 
to the temple together. Come, it is time now for 
our departure. (Rises and looks of.) Yes, the 
dial nears the hour. 
_ Jutta. I also am to attend a festival, but not 
at the temple with you, dear Fausta. 
Fausta. Oh! Said I not you had cause for 
blushing? Are you to go with Lucius and his 
mother ? 
Juuta. No, dear Fausta, you are wrong again. 
I have seen neither Lucius nor his mother for 
many days. 
Fausta. Then, with whom will you go to the 
temple if with neither Lucius nor myself ? 
Jutia. 1 go not to that temple at all, dear 
Fausta. 
Fausta (comes to Jutta and places hand upon 
her shoulder). How mysterious you are, Julia. 
If not there, then where will you go to celebrate 
the incoming of the spring ? 
Jutta. Mayhap you have heard of the Chris- 
tians ? 
Fausta. Christian? Oh, yes; that is but 
another name for atheist. : 
JULIA (rising). How can you say that, 
Fausta ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
144 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
Fausta. Because they do not believe in any 
god. 
Junta. Oh! I perceive you have been listen- 
ing to the scandalous stories concerning them. 
Fausta. Were you ever in one of their 
houses ? 
Juuia. Certainly; for now, under the pro- 
tection of the good Emperor Constantine, one 
may go freely among these Christians. 
Fausta. But did you ever see statues of the 
gods with them such as we always have about us ? 
Juuia. Certainly not, Fausta. 
Fausta. Then does not that prove that they 
believe not in the gods, since they make no statues 
of them to aid in their worship ? 
Jutta. But Fausta, dear, you understand not 
their belief. They believe in one god, not in 
many ; a spiritual and invisible being whom no 
man can represent in statuary, because no man 
hath seen him with the bodily eye. 
Faustra. But how can they worship him ? 
Juxt1a. In spirit. Come with me to their 
temple to-day. You know the one they have 
just completed so near the magnificent Temple of 
the Sun. 
Fausta. Yes, yes, we all know it well, and 
wonder at Constantine’s infatuation in allowing 
it to be built. But what goes on there to-day, 
my Julia? This is our day, our feast to the 
vernal gods and goddesses.
-P-A-G-E-143

Jutta. Come with me and see. It is true 
their feast day is kept this year on your festal 
day, but in what a different spirit. 
‘ausTA. Tell me of their celebration. 
Jutta. I cannot, for I have not yet seen 
it myself, but I have heard—perhaps you would 
not wish to hear about it, Fausta ? 
Fausta. Go on, go on, I beg of you. 
Jutta. They celebrate with hymns and 
prayers the resurrection from the dead of their 
founder, Jesus Christ. 
Fausta. Oh, yes, I have heard of him. He 
was a Jew, was he not, and was crucified by 
them ? 
Jutta. Yes, and on the third day he rose 
again, and now these Christians celebrate the 
wondrous event. 
Fausta. But why have they chosen our festal 
day ? 
Jutra. It was just a coincidence this year. 
Their day is regulated by the full paschal moon, 
because he, the Holy One, was crucified at the 
time of the Jewish Passover. So, you see, it must 
come in the spring about the time of your Roman 
festivities; this year it chances to come on the 
very same day. 
Fausta. Then it will not be possible for us to 
visit both temples ? 
Jutia. No, dear Fausta, we must give up one 
or the other. 
 
-P-A-G-E-144

Fausta. And have you become one of these 
Christians ? 
Juura. Yes, dear Fausta, and that is why 
this spring is more beautiful than any other, be- 
cause for the first time I go to celebrate the resur- 
rection of my Lord. (She twines her arm about 
Fausta, who returns the caress.) 
Fausta. Dear Julia, forgive me for attribut- 
ing your joy to a more earthly cause. But would 
that I knew something about this wonderful new 
religion that gives you so much happiness. Tell 
me of it, Julia. (They walk slowly toward R.) 
Jura. Oh, Fausta, it is very little indeed 
that I can tell you. Iam just a beginner myself, 
but come with me and we will both learn more 
of it. But even I have learned enough to make 
me supremely happy. 
Fausta.”\So you have, dear Julia. I can read 
it in your face. I will go with you that I too 
may hear about the Christ.

apart for those children so dear to my heart— 
trees. Wise and beneficent indeed was that mortal 
—let me see, I think they called him Governor 
Smith—who first set apart a day to be called 
Arbor Day. It is now * years since the day 
first honored in a place called Nebraska, and who 
can compute the number of trees that have found 
a permanent home in old Mother Earth since that 
time? I wonder how many and what sort of 
trees will be planted to-day. There was a time 
when mortals thought that the only trees worth 
planting were those that bore fruit, but they have 
grown wiser, and they now love all trees for their 
beauty and for their beneficial influence on the 
earth’s atmosphere, even though they furnish no 
direct sustenance to mortals. Buthark! (Musie.)

the corn and beans wait a little, I never slight 
Arbor Day. 
Dame N. A wise man, indeed, are you, dear 
Farmer. But what trees shall you plant to-day ? 
Farmer. That I have not yet decided. They 
are all so beautiful and so helpful too, that I find 
it very hard to take one kind and leave another. 
Damir N. Well, here are several kinds ; now 
make your choice among them. 
(All the trees.) 
Yes, dear Farmer, choose with care, 
Though we all your love would share. 
Farmer. Now, Mr. (or Miss) Pine, you are 
first; can you give any good reasons why you 
should be chosen ? 
PINE. 
I am the ever cheerful pine ; 
To me at once all hearts incline. 
When other trees their bare boughs spread, 
Or flaunt their brown leaves stiff and dead, 
I wave my “ needles ” green on high 
To cheer the lonely passer-by. 
And, as on me they turn their gaze, 
Forgotten winter’s icy ways, 
I give glad smiles when others frown, 
And odors sweet, and cones of brown. 
Then, plant me, Farmer, near your door, 
And hear my music evermore.

You may sing your song, 
Through the whole day long, 
Oh, you trees, so green and fair, 
But look at the fruit I bear.

Robin will tell you which is best. 
Always with me he builds his nest. 
My blossoms carpet his dwelling o’er, 
My fruit hangs close beside his door. 
Yes, Robin, dear Robin, he knows best, 
Since he comes to me to build his nest. 
If you his music would daily hear, 
Then plant the apple tree, Farmer, dear. 
Farmer. That is true, Mother Nature. A 
pair of robins have had their home in an old 
apple tree near my house for many years. Oh, 
how the little fellow used to sing all day long. 
His merry tune filled our hearts with joy, summer 
after summer. But one day last year a dreadful 
thing happened! (Soft, sad music.) 
DamEN. Tell me about it, Farmer, dear. 
Farmer. It makes my heart stand still to 
think of it all, even now. One day a man, mind 
you, not a thoughtless boy, but a full-grown man 
who had little ones of his own, became curious to 
see how large the young robins had grown, so he
-P-A-G-E-150

climbed the tree to look into the nest. I begged 
him to keep away, for I knew it would distress 
the old birds, they had never been disturbed in 
their chosen spot, but laughing at my anxiety, 
and saying, “Oh, never fear, V’ll not touch the 
precious things,” up the tree he went. But the 
nest was high, the limb, in the forks of which it 
rested, was long and flexible, and as the despoiler 
caught at the adjoining limb, the old birds flew 
around uttering their piercing cries, and, dear 
Mother Nature, you know there is nothing more 
pitiful in all your realm than the cries of a parent 
bird. I knew their instincts were true, and that’ 
something dreadful was about to happen! Just 
at this point my young daughter, hearing the 
commotion, ran out of the house to the old apple 
tree. As she came under it calling to the man 
to “come down,” out went the two frightened 
young birds. They had not yet learned that they 
owned a pair of wings, and down they came from 
their great height, but my little daughter, with 
the quickness which we all admire in her, threw 
out her dainty white apron, and the poor fledg- 
lings landed safely upon it. The man came down 
after them and replaced them in the nest, but I 
shuddered at what might have happened had it 
not been for the lucky arrival of the white apron. 
There would have been a tragedy, for we all 
know that the old birds would have forsaken the 
nest had their little ones suffered death.
-P-A-G-E-151

Dame N. It would indeed have been a 
tragedy! Home, love and joy changed in a 
minute to sorrow, sacrificed to idle curiosity. 
Farmer. Why are people so slow to learn 
not to destroy what they cannot replace? Not 
to tear down what they cannot rebuild ? 
Dame N. Why are they, indeed? That is 
one of the questions no one can answer. But 
instead of thinking of what “might have hap- 
pened” let us rejoice over the recovery of the 
birds, and the continuance of the robin’s sweet 
song. The blunders of meddlesome people do 
not often end so fortunately, but yonder is the

I'll meet them all, and smiling still 
Will bravely do my part. 
Yes, choose the oak so stanch and true, 
And in your age ’twill shelter you. 
Dame N. That is good advice, Farmer. 
Farmer. So it is. Would you, then, choosc 
the oak above all others, Mother Nature ? 
Dame N. (rising quickly). That is not for me 
to say. You must make your own selection. It 
is my part to make the trees grow, but I cannot 
interfere with your choice. 
Farmer. Well, this is a bad box to be in. 
Dame N. Howso? Do I not hear you many 
times a day railing at me because I have left you 
no choice in certain matters? And yet now 
that a choice is within your power, you are still 
not satisfied. I wonder if there was ever any- 
thing else created so inconsistent as a human 
being ? 
Farmer. But don’t you see? If I plant a 
row of oaks I shall no sooner be done than I 
shall wish I had planted something else, and it 
will be just the same if I go the other way 
round. Ah, I have it. (Rises, trundles wheel-

Dame N. Well, human beings are wonderful 
things after all. How quickly they extricate 
themselves from any difficulties. But now I 
have a busy day before me; trees are being 
planted everywhere. I must see that the east 
wind does not blow too roughly, that the sun 
hides his face behind the clouds most of the day, 
and that, toward night, a warm and gentle rain 
comes down. Oh, but I do believe I am the 
busiest woman that ever lived. (A local hit

THE UNEXPECTED MAY QUEEN 
(A May Day Dialogue for Six Girls) 
OHARACTERS.—ELENOR, Lucy, JULIA, STELLA, 
Myrrin, Teacner. The teacher should be 
taken by w girl taller than the others, but not 
necessarily older. 
CostumEs.—ELENOR. At rise, faded, but clean, 
calico dress, coarse shoes, faded sunbonnet, or old 
straw hat, carries covered basket, hair in one 
long braid, tied with faded ribbon. On second 
entrance, white dress, black slippers, red sash, 
hair flowing. Other characters, white dresses, 
three of them with blue sashes and two with red 
ones. 
SornE.—Ordinary stage, the floor covered with 
green burlaps to represent lawn. Low stump at 
R. F. May-pole in centre, with six long ribbons 
fastened to the top; three are of red, and three are 
of blue. They may be cheaply made of paper 
cambric. The May-pole should be. fastened 
securely to floor of stage. Any lively march 
music may be played for the march around 
the May-pole. When the music begins at close of 
dialogue the girls skip to the pole, those with red 
ribbons taking the red ribbons in hand and the 
blue taking the blue, using right hands. They

march out forming large circle and bow to 
audience, then to each other, then all march back, 
close to pole. 
All march around pole to the right, placing left 
hand on hip and holding ribbons high, then change 
ribbons to left hand and placing right hand on hip 
march around to left. Repeat these two move- 
ments. 
The three girls in blue make outer circle, keep- 
ing step with music, but not changing position, 
“marking time,” while the girls in red march 
around the circle inside the larger circle, then 
halt, facing blues, and all curtsey. 
All join hands, with ribbons in right hands, 
and march around pole in wide circle. The three 
girls in blue now march around in inside circle, 
while girls in red make larger circle and “ mark 
time,” halt and all curtsey as before. All join 
hands again as before and march in wide circle. 
Repeat, taking ribbons in left hands. 
Lively tune; blues run to pole, march in quick 
time several measures (eight or ten); reds run to 
pole, quick time ; march, the same. Blues march 
around in circletoL. Reds march around in circle 
to R. Reverse and repeat. All march around 
plaiting the ribbons, reverse and unplait. All face 
pole, join hands and march to pole, right about 
face, and march away from pole ; repeat ; second 
time, drop ribbons and march away from pole,

obtained to train the girls for this May-pole exer- 
cise. Other changes may be introduced. ‘ 
ELENOR (discovered at rise, walking around the 
May-pole, looking at it curiously). 'That must be 
for one of those May-pole parties that I have heard 
grandmother tell about so often. Oh, if I could 
only stay and see it. JI wonder how long before 
they will be here? But I mustn’t stay. Grand- 
mother told me not to stop anywhere for anything, 
but to deliver these eggs at once to Mrs. Miller, so 
I must go. 
(Goes around May-pole and coming down moves 
Off R., keeping eyes on pole. Enter L., TEACHER 
and others. ELENOR moves off more slowly, look- 
ing at them over her shoulder.) 
TEACHER. Oh, good-morning, little girl 
What makes you go? 
ExLenor. I must. 
SretLa. Do you live near here ? 
ELenor. Yes. 
SreLia. Well, then, run home quickly and 
put on your white dress, and a red sash, and come 
back and march with us around the May-pole. 
(ELENOR stands transfixed while the others are 
talking.) 
Lucy. One of the girls is ill, and we didn’t 
know it until we stopped for her just now, so you 
can come in her place. We must have six, you 
know, to make the march go right. ;

Aut. Yes, yes, hurry, hurry. 
Sretta. Why don’t you go? But remember 
you must wear a red sash. 
Etrenor. A red sash! Oh, oh! (Bursts into 
tears und ewits R., hastily and sobbing.) 
SreLia. Well, now, what did I say to make 
her feel like that ? 
TEACHER. She probably has no red sash o 
no money to buy one. 
AuL. Who is she? 
TreacHEer. Howshould I know? I neversaw 
her before. 
Lucy. Oh, well, who cares, anyway ? 
STELLA. I do, because if she had pretty clothes 
on she might join us, and we gous have our May- 
pole march after all. 
Jutra. I never heard of any one so incon- 
siderate as Dorothy, to get sick this morning of 
all times. 
Myrrie. I think you are the inconsiderate 
one, Julia. Do you suppose Dorothy wanted to be 
ill? Most any girl would rather be out here 
_ playing than be shut up in the house with a sore 
throat. 
Luey. Yes,indeed. For my part I’m sorry for 
Dorothy. But why do we stay here? We might 
just as well go back home. 
TracHer. You forget, Lucy, that the lunch 
baskets are to be here about noon. 
Luoy. Well, what of it? If the man comes

with the stuff and doesn’t find any one here he can 
simply turn around and go home again. It will 
be nothing to him, for of course he’ll have his 
pay just the same. 
TracHER. Then there are the musicians 
(motions) whom we paid to come. 
Lucy. They can go home too. We'll pay 
their car fare, and they’ll be nothing out. 
STELLA. Lucy, you are talking nonsense. We 
came out here to spend the day, and I for one 
mean to stay. 
(Cries from others, “So do I.) 
TxacHEr. We surely can amuse ourselves in 
some way, and maybe the little girl will come 
back ; then we'll ask her to join us, and we'll 
have our May-pole dance just the same. 
Srecia. What! in that shabby gown, and 
those coarse shoes ? 
Jutta. She would spoil the picture. 
Myrrire. Who cares for the picture as long 
as she can keep step with the rest of us, and is 
sweet and well behaved ? 
TracHER. She was certainly very sweet-look- 
ing and I have no doubt she can imitate the rest 
of us. i 
Jutta. But suppose she doesn’t come back ? 
She didn’t act as if she intended to. 
Lucy. But what in the world can we do while 
waiting ?

TreacuER. No, no, let us not bother the birds. 
I tell you, Stella and Lucy, we have the music 
here and you can-each sing for us, one of your 
pretty songs, and Myrtle can give us a recitation. 
Myrrix. But what will you and Julia do? 
Jut1a. Oh, we'll be the audience and clap 
our hands as loudly as ever we can.

already known by her. Lucy does the same.

my basket, when Mrs. Miller came out and began 
to talk to me. Pretty soon I told her about the 
May party, and the pole with its ribbons, and 
how fine you all looked. She asked me one or 
two questions and I told her you had asked me to 
come and take the place of some other little girl. 
Then she said, “ Well, Pll get your money right 
away, so you can hurry home and change your 
dress,” and I said, “ No, no, I can’t change my 
dress (sobs) because this is the only one that I 
have, and when grandmother washes and irons 
this ne, she puts an old one of my mother’s on 
me, and pins it up.” (Sobs.) .Then she said, “ You 
are just about Dorothy’s size. She is in bed, be- 
cause she disobeyed me yesterday and brought on 
asore throat. Do you ever disobey your grand- 
mother?” I said, “ No, because that would make 
her sad and I love her, and don’t like to see her 
sad.” Then she took me by the hand, and said, 
“Come with me,” and we went up-stairs into the 
loveliest room, and she put all these beautiful 
things on me, and unbraided my hair and brushed 
it. Then she said, so sweet and kind, “ Now, dear 
child, go to the May-pole party, and I’ll send the 
coachman home with your basket and things and 
write a note to your grandmother telling her 
where you are, and these things you are to keep, 
every one.” So here I am. 
STELLA. Oh, how perfectly lovely !. And now 
let us make her our May Queen.

Lucy. Where is the wreath? Didn’t some 
one bring it ? 
TrAcHER. Yes, it is here. 
(One of the musicians hands it to the TEACHER, who 
places it on ELENOR’S head.) 
ELENor. Oh, what must I say ? 
TracueEr. , Nothing, dear, except that you love 
us and will be our queen. 
ExLenor. Oh, I thank you all so much, and 
I love you, and I will be your queen. 
Myrrie. But a queen must have a throne. 
Here, sit on this stump. Now we will all come 
and kneel before you and kiss your hand. (Leads 
her to stump R. ¥. She sits. Music. They all 
fall into line with the TEACHER at the head, and 
march to the queen, each dropping on one knee, 
kissing her right hand and passing back of stump.

CHARACTERS.—Lucy, JuLiA, ImoGEen, EFFTE, 
schoolgirls. TwacHER. She must be some- 
what taller than the other girls. IMOGEN should 
be a decided brunette, the others as fair as pos- 
sible. 
CostumES.—Ordinary costumes. Girls carry 
books in straps, but wear no hats or wraps. 
ScenE.—A schoolroom. Desks and chairs on the 
stage, wall maps and a blackboard, also a globe 
and any other conwenient accessories. Two cur- 
tains must be used for this exercise, an outer 
and an inner one. 
(As the first curtain rises, Lucy and JULIA enter 
R., Lucy talking ; come down together.) 
Luoy. It will be the event of the season, for 
Helen never does things by halves. (@oes to desk, 
sits and wnstraps books.) My! but these are 
heavy! T’ll be glad when I’m a senior. There'll 
not be so many books to carry around. 
Jutta. Oh, that’s a trifle compared to the 
fact that we’ll be nearly done with school. But 
what are books and school when compared to 
Helen’s party? What shall you wear? (Goce 
up and pauses beside Lucy’s desk.) 
164
-P-A-G-E-163

Lucy. The great question again! Well, I 
must not wear any of my old things, that’s sure. 
I have a new pink silk nearly done, and P’ll get 
mamma to hurry the dressmaker up on it. 
(IMoGEN enters R.) 
Jui (lays books on desk and meets IMOGEN ; they 
come down while talking). Oh, Imogen, of course 
you have been invited to Helen’s party. Isn’t it 
perfectly grand ? 
ImoGEN (surprised). I have been invited, but 
surely you are not going ? 
Tue oTHERS. Not going ? 
Juxi1A. Why, Imogen, whatever can you mean ? 
I know you like Helen and she will have a per- 
fectly lovely party. 
ImoGEN (goes to desk and begins unstrapping 
books). But would you go to a party on Decora- 
tion Day ? 
JULIA. ' Oh, ha! ha! why, how funny! Ha! 
Luoy. ha! 
Imocen. Do you think that’s funny? (Zhe 
others nod and continue to laugh.) Then I must 
say that shows the wonderful difference between 
the blue and the gray. 
ee \ What do you mean? 
Imogen. In my Southern home we do not 
make Decoration Day a gala time. (EFF1E enters 
R.; comes down.) We keep it sacred and put
-P-A-G-E-164

flowers on the graves of our loved ones, especially 
on those of the dear boys in gray. 
Lucy. But you cannot reach the graves of 
your boys in gray now. 
Imogren. That is true; but they tell me you 
also put flowers on your soldiers’ graves, so I will 
put some on the graves of the boys in blue, and 
perhaps some Northern girl in my Southern home 
will do as much for the graves down there. 
Jutia. Perhaps, since there is no longer any 
difference in the colors that our soldier boys wear. 
Imocren. Yes,and I am gladof it. I love you 
Northern people, but I cannot believe in merry- 
making on Decoration Day. 
Erriz. Well, girls, I think Imogen isright. I 
suppose you are talking over Helen’s party. 
(TEACHER enters R. ; comes down. EFFIE goes to 
desk.) 
ImogEn. Oh, teacher, the girls think I am 
fussy and notional because I don’t like parties on 
Decoration Day. Am I? 
TracHEeR. Indeed you are not, Imogen, and 
here is a little handbill that was given me as I 
came along (shows any handbill), a notice of a 
great ball game on Decoration Day. So it goes. 
Thanksgiving Day and Christmas are made merry- 
making days, and now they have taken even the 
solemn Memorial Day for the same purpose. 
Juuia. Imogen says she shall put flowers on 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
    
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 167 
the graves of our soldier boys because she cannot 
reach the graves of the Southern soldier boys. 
ImoeEen. The girls have reminded me that 
there are no longer boys in gray, but that they all 
wear the blue alike. So, as I could not go toa 
party in my Southern home out of respect to the 
dear graves there, surely I cannot do it here, now 
could I? 
TracuER. You are right, dear. I wish that 
we Northerners had more of your spirit. 
Erriz. So do I. 
Lucy. But surely you wouldn’t have us refuse 
to attend the party ? 
Errie. Why not? 
Jutta. Oh, that would never do. Helen 
would never forgive us. 
Lucy. Besides, I am afraid we all want to go. 
Erriz. Oh, girls, I‘ can cut the Gordian knot. 
Helen is in the dressing-room, and she told me just 
now that she had not sent out her invitations yet ; 
had only invited a few intimate friends, verbally, 
so far. Let’s go to her and see if we cannot in- 
duce her to change the day. 
ALL. Yes, come on, come on.

taught some of us a needed lesson.

(Exxeunt x. Second curtain rises for tableau.) 
TABLEAU.—Two soldiers in full uniform, one 
blue, the other gray, stand in centre of stage with 
clasped hands. Above them is an arch, bearing 
the word “ Peace.” If this word could be repre- 
sented with electric lights, it would be very effect- 
ive. If an electric arrangement is impossible 
make the lettering of evergreens on white muslin, 
twining the arch also with evergreens. Under 
the arch place American flags in any effective ar- 
rangement. On the right of the two soldiers are 
the dead embers of a camp-fire ; let this be very 
evident. On the left a number of guns should be 
stacked. During the continuance of the tableau 
the “Star Spangled Banner” is played by the 
orchestra or piano. At the fall of the curtain on 
the tableau the following song is sung by the school. 
Sone 
(Tune: ‘‘ Let the Lower’ Lights be Burning.’’) 
The camp-fires of war are darkened, 
Its hot embers glow no more. 
Hushed is the blare of the trumpet 
And silenced the cannon’s roar. 
Cxrorus.—We are brothers, we are brothers, 
See the flag above us wave, 
Steadfastly clinging together, 
Fighting its honor to save.

Stacked are the guns of contention, 
Folded the war-tents away. 
Sweet peace reigns o’er us and welcomes 
With smiles the new dawning day. 
Loving the North and the Southland, 
Vowing to both to be true, | 
We'll stand with shoulder to shoulder 
Wearing the dear, sacred blue. 
Turning our backs on the old days, 
Looking with hope to the new, 
Loving the North and the Southland, 
And proudly wearing the blue. 
(It will be very effective to let the two soldiers come 
forward at the fall of the curtain, and sing the 
Sour stanzas, the school singing the chorus only.)

CHARACTERS.—SPAIN, ENGLAND, FRANCE,

CostuMES, ETO.—Ordinary suits may be worn, 
but drape the body in the flags represented. 
Carry same on poles, conspicuously. Spanish 
flag: broad centre stripe of orange, horizontal, 
with narrower stripes of red above and below. 
In orange strip near pole is an emblem, a gilt 
crown above circle containing horses rampant 
and turret, side by side. English flag: plain 
red, with crown in lower right hand corner. 
Do not use the “ Union Jack,” as the verses 
refer to red flag.” Hrance: three broad belts 
of blue, white and red, the blue nearest the staff. 
The stripes are of same width and are parallel 
with the pole. United States needs no descrip- 
tion. 
(The boys enter from R., come to centre of plat- 
form and recite their lines, then step to rear.

back to that time when you chased us back across

their parents in disposition.

best, so it must go above yours. (Maises the 
English flag as high as he can reach.) 
Unirep Starrs. It is the oldest, ’ll admit, 
but have you ever thought aboutit ? Your Union 
Jack shows the same colors as our flag. You 
sing “three cheers for the red, white and blue,” 
and so do we. We sing our beloved song, 
“ America,” to the same tune that you sing “ God 
save the King.” Do not all these things mean 
that we should be good friends? Come now, 
bring your flag down on a level with the stars 
and stripes. As brothers we can defy the world 
together. We can hold the peace of the world 
in our hands. Apart—the things that might 
happen are too terrible even to think of.

keep off my premises? (A%tchs tub over; water

back). You getee no clackers for your bigee day. 
What you do then? No clackers, no noisee. 
(Zeit R.) ; 
UNcLE Sam (picking up tub). Well, that’s a 
serious proposition. What would we do, indeed, 
if the heathen Chinee should really say, “No 
more firecrackers ” ? 
FourtH or JuLy (enters L.; comes down). 
What’s that you are saying, Uncle Sam? No 
more firecrackers? Why, what are you thinking 
of? Do you intend that the boys of this land 
shall learn to forget me and all I stand for ? 
Uncie Sam. Is that all you mean to them, 
just a lot of noisy combustibles? If so, then, the 
sooner they forget you the better. 
. FourrH oF Juty. I may mean only that to 
them while they are young, but when they are 
older they will see that the noise —— 
UNCLE SAM (interrupting). Was just noise and 
nothing else. 
Fourtu or Juty. Quite the contrary ; they 
will see that the noise in which they so delighted 
stood for their great joy in being Americans. 
Uncite Sam. I am beginning to have my 
doubts about that. 
FourtH or JuLy. Oh, come, Uncle Sam, you

are joking. Beginning to doubt that Americans 
love their country and are proud of her? Oh, 
well, now, that is really quite a joke for you, 
Uncle Sam. (Laughs.) 
Uncie Sam. Indeed it’s no joke. Wish it 
were, but it is only too serious. How can men 
love a country that they are trying to wreck ? 
Fourts or Jury. Oh, but Uncle Sam, you 
must admit they are not all bad. We have 
some men to be proud of, you surely cannot deny 
that. 
Unote Sam. Yes,afew. But to tell you the 
truth, dear Fourth of July, sometimes I am so 
angry at my tricky children that I think it might 
be a good thing to abolish you altogether, and of 
course with you would go the Firecracker (FIRE- 
CRACKER enters R.; comes down), the Torpedo 
(enter TORPEDO, R. ; comes down), the Sky-rocket 
(SKY-ROCKET enters R. ; comes down), and the rest 
of the noisy lot, for lam beginning to fear that our 
patriotism is becoming just a lot of talk and 
bluster. 
FrrecRACKER. Oh, come now, Uncle Sam, 
you are out of sorts to-day. Isn’t this the greatest 
country in the world ? 
Uncie Sam (crossing over). Of course it is. 
Who dares say it isn’t ? 
FIRECRACKER. Then why not let us say so? 
That’s what every bang of every cracker ——

Fourtu or Juty. Youspeak slightingly, dear 
Uncle Sam, of all our noise because some of your 
children fail to turn out such noble and as upright 
citizens as you would like to have them. But 
have you ever thought how much less they would 
have loved their country had it not been for my 
noisy day ?

and the fires of patriotism might go forever un- 
kindled in his bosom. 
SKy-ROOKET. From time immemorial the sky- 
rocket has been emblematic of joy and glorious 
aspiration. 
Unc ie Sam. Well, I do believe you are too 
much for me. But what if the Chinaman refuse 
to sell us explosives wherewith to celebrate our 
great day ? 
FourtH or Jury. Then we will make them 
ourselves. But he will not do that. See, there 
he’s now, watching us. Come in, John. (Enter

stars. These may be cut from gilt paper and 
pasted or glued upon the gown. Hair flowing, 
a liberty cap on the head made of red and white

found in many of the illustrated papers. 
ScrenE.— Ordinary stage. 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
This exercise must be given ona stage furnished 
with an outer and an inner curtain. CoLUMBIA 
is discovered at rise of the outside curtain. When 
she calls UncLE Sam’s attention to the picture, 
the inside curtain rises on the tableau indicated»by 
number in the dialogue. At the proper time this 
curtain falls, rising again on the next tableau, and 
so on to the close. Netting may be drawn across

the stage where the tableaux are shown, or a large 
frame may be so arranged that the characters of 
the tableaux stand within it, making them a suc- 
cession of “ living pictures.” 
DESCRIPTION OF TABLEAUX 
No. 1. Small child, ragged, barefoot, dirty and 
generally unkempt. 
No. 2. Handsome woman, elegantly arrayed 
in the height of fashion, with a profusion of

Treasury.” At R., a table; on this table small 
bags carefully tied, and marked “Coin.” Be- 
tween the table and box, well-dressed man, one 
hand holding a bag of coin as if to place on table, 
the other hand out of sight in the box. 
No. 4. Handsome, smiling, well-dressed man, 
young woman leaning on his arm; behind them 
three women, the one at the rear old, faded, 
shabbily dressed, on her breast a card plainly 
marked No. 1, the next somewhat younger and less 
shabby marked No. 2, and the next still more pre- 
possessing marked No. 3. The one on his arm 
must be young, and richly dressed. 
No. 5. A barrel and bottles on a table. 
Around the table a motley crowd of ragged, 
dirty children.

No. 7. A man tightly bound with a rope 
wound around him from head to foot. On the 
rope a large placard with the one word, “ Trusts,” 
in capital letters. 
(ConumBria discovered walking up and down 
stage. 
CotumsBia. The great and glorious Fourth! 
Well, it is certainly great, but as to its being 
glorious, that is a matter of opinion. (UNCLE 
Sam enters R.) Well, Sammie, another birthday 
for you. What a very old fellow youare. But I 
declare you don’t change at all. In fact you look 
exactly as you did the first day that I saw you. 
Uncoie Sam (coming down). Do I? Well, I 
suppose you mean that for a compliment, but Iam 
not so sure about it. How can I improve if I 
don’t change, Columby ? 
CotumBiA. That is true, Sammie, and to be 
perfectly frank with you, which you knowis a 
sister’s privilege, there is certainly room for im- 
provement. 
Uncie Sam (angrily). What do you mean? 
Don’t you know I am the most wonderful creature 
on this planet? That this is the most glorious 
country ever seen? That the star spangled banner 
waves over a land unparalleled in its prosperity ? 
Cotumpsta.. Alas! and alas! Sammie, that is 
the old familiar boast. Look on this picture. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 183 
(Tableau No.1.) And now (after pause) on this. 
(Tableau No. 2.) 
Unc ie Sam. Well, what of it? Who is to 
blame ? 
CotumBiA. You are,Sammie. There is some- 
thing wrong in a land where these two dreadful 
extremes are seen, when the rich grow richer, 
day by day, and the poor, heaven help them, 
poorer. 
Uncie Sam. Oh, well, suggest a remedy if 
you can. 
CotumBiA. Thatis not my business, but yours, 
and a country which does as much bragging as 
this one should be able to solve the problem. 
(UncLE Sam turns away and moves toward R. 
exit.) But wait a minute, Sammie dear. I have 
some more pretty pictures to show you. (Zableaw 
No. 3.) 
UnciE Sam. Oh, come now, Columby, I don’t 
make people’s characters. Can I help it because 
rogues get into office ? 
CoLtumpBrA. You can make laws that. will 
drive rogues out of office. You can create a 
public sentiment that will make roguery and 
trickery of all kinds unpopular, that will make 
the rogues shunned and ostracized by society and 
not as now, fawned upon and flattered. 
UnotEe Sam. Oh, dear, dear Columby, you 
always were hard on me. 
CotumBia. No, I am not hard on you; but
-P-A-G-E-182
  184 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
I see your faults and point them out to you. 
That is what women are for, you know, to correct 
the men’s faults, and that reminds me, here is 
another picture for you to behold on this great 
and glorious Fourth of July. (Zableaw No. 4.) 
UncLE Sam. Well, that is a pretty bad state 
of things, I must confess, but really I don’t see 
how I can help it, Columby, if men will get sick 
of their wives and marry again. 
CotumBiA. I have no patience with you, Sam, 
to be always telling that you can’t help things. 
If you can’t help letting things go wrong, then 
no one can. 
UncieE Sam (angrily). But what would you 
have me do ? 
CoLumBIA. ‘Oh, come now, Sammie, don’t fly 
in a rage. You are not so foolish or so ignorant 
that you cannot find your way out of a difficulty 
if you once determine that you will do so. You 
always have got yourself out of a bad box when 
you have really put on your thinking cap. 
Uncie Sam. But don’t you think, Columby, 
you are giving me a queer sort of a birthday, 
showing me so many unpleasant pictures ? 
Cotumsia. No matter, Sammie; it will be 
the making of you. Better be studying my 
pictures than shooting off firecrackers. And that 
reminds me it is about time to give you another. 
(Tableau No. 5.) 
UnoLE Sam. But this is becoming absurd, 
   
-P-A-G-E-183
ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 185 
Columby. Can I help it because some men spend 
in evil ways the money that ought to go on their 
children’s backs ? 
Cotumsia. You can make a law that will 
punish men who squander their substance in 
this way, and you can decrease the number of 
the places that tempt them. Oh, you can find a 
way to solve all these problems if you try, 
Sammie, I know. 
UncLe Sam. You are the most unreasonable 
creature that I ever came across, Columby. Why, 
you expect nothing short of the millennium. 
CotumBta. No, I don’t ; I only expect you to 
make this country come up to your bragging 
point, the best and freest land for children to 
grow up in. You are not doing your level best, 
and you know it. Now, come, be honest, Sammie. 
Are you ? 
UNcLE Sam (moves off L., angrily). Oh, I'm 
tired to death of your preaching. 
CotumBia. Are you? Well, then, Ill stop 
preaching and show you another picture. (Zad- 
leau Wo. 6.) 
Uncire Sam. Now, I'd like to know what 
that means, Columby. I didn’t kill that fellow, 
did I? 
CoLuMBIA (severely). Yes, and thousands 
like him. You have become so regardless of 
human life that railroad accidents, automobile 
accidents and recklessness in every other form
-P-A-G-E-184
186 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
are of almost hourly occurrence. I venture te 
say that there is no other country in the world 
where human life is held so cheap, and for this 
you are to blame. 
UnotE Sam. Well, all I have to say is that 
I am glad I don’t have a birthday every day, 
since its only object seems to be to give me a 
blowing up and show me disagreeable things. 
CotumBiA. But, Sammie, own up now, like 
the good old fellow that you really are. Have 
I shown you anything that is not absolutely 
true, or said a word that you can honestly con- 
tradict ? 
UNCLE Sam (crossing over rapidly). Oh, go 
long, Columby, go ’long; you do ask the most 
pointed questions. 
Cotumpia. So you don’t like my questions 
any better than my preaching? Very well then; 
here is another picture for you. What do you 
think of that ? (Tableau No. 7.) 
UNCLE Sam (tears hair and crosses over quickly). 
Oh, this is too much, too much. The next thing 
you'll be blaming me for the early frosts, for the 
rust on wheat, for the seventeen year locusts and 
the local droughts. 
CotumBIA. Oh, no, Sammie, not quite so bad 
as that. But you cannot deny that you are re- 
sponsible in a greater or less degree for every evil 
that I have mentioned. 
Uncie Sam (angrily). Yes, 1 can, yes, I can.
-P-A-G-E-185
  ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 187 
I can explain away all your pictures and all your 
arguments. 
CotumBIA (laughing). Oh, I don’t doubt that 
at all; but I’m very sure you cannot explain 
away the stern, hard facts. Nothing can do that, 
Sammie, nothing but their removal. 
Unc iE Sam. Well, you are a meddlesome old 
busybody, that’s what you are. 
CotumBIA. Of course I am, and I intend to 
keep right on meddling until all these things 
are straightened out, until every wrong is righted. 
Uncie Sam. You do, eh? Well, you'll have 
your hands full, I tell you. (Crosses over angrily.) 
CotuMBIA (following him and taking him by 
the arm). But come, old boy, let’s not quarrel. 
You and I have always been good friends, and we 
both love this country, don’t we ? 
Unoxie Sam. Yes. I am sure of that. 
CotumBia. And so, Sammie, dear, suppose 
you celebrate this’ birthday by resolving that 
you will remedy these evils. I tell you, my 
dear old fellow, if you don’t you’ll not have a 
country long. 
UnoiE Sam. Perhaps you are right. 
CoLtumBra. Your sober judgment must 
assure you that I am right. The storm is com- 
ing, and unless you do something to avert it, 
we are all going down together. Promise me 
1Give number of birthday by figuring from 1776 to current 
year, 
   
-P-A-G-E-186
  188 ENTERTAINMENTS FOR ALL THE YEAR 
now, Sammie, that you'll begin at once to make 
things better. 
Uncie Sam. Yes, I will. Does that satisfy 
you? 
Cotumsta. It certainly does, Sammie, for I 
know that you are a man of your word. And 
now we'll go light a bunch of firecrackers. 
Uncie Sam. One bunch? Twenty of them. 
CotumBia. As many as you like, for this is 
indeed a notable birthday. 
(They march out arm-in-arm to the tune of “ The 
Star Spangled Banner.” As the curtain falls 
on the empty stage, firecrackers go of behind 
scenes.)

A LABOR DAY ORATOR 
(A Dialogue for Labor Day) 
CHARACTERS.— Zhe ORaTOR. His WIFE. CAR- 
RIE, the child. Macaix, the maid of all work, 
the trades, represented by boys, as many as can be 
secured. 
CostumMES.—ORATOR. An ordinary business 
man’s swit. CARRIE. Meat home dress. WIFE. 
Neat calico dress. Maaetr. The same, with 
the addition of a gingham apron, sleeves rolled 
up, carries dish towel. The trades. Work- 
men’s blouses and overalls. Carry implements 
of the trades represented ; thus, the carpenter car- 
ries hammer, plane and saw, painter wears big 
apron, and carries an assortment of brushes, the 
farmer carries a hoe, or a shovel, etc. They are 
all bareheaded, hats, of course, supposed to have 
‘been left in hallway. 
GENERAL DirEcTIONS.—CARRIE should be taken 
by a child as small as can be found to assume 
the character acceptably. The Wi¥8 should bea 
girl considerably larger and heavier than the 
Orator. The boys who personate the trades 
should be well-grown. lads between the ages of 
fourteen and sixteen. Let them be as nearly as 
possible of the same size.

ORATOR (discovered seated at table, manuscript 
outspread before him, reads). “Work is the 
apotheosis of humanity.” (Looks up.) I wonder 
what he means by that? This is what I call a 
fake, paying a fellow five dollars to write you a 
ripping good speech and then getting a thing that 
you can’t understand. » Well, there’s one comfort 
—if I don’t understand it, neither will the rest of 
them, and if they don’t understand it they'll think 
it’s clever, of course, so here goes again. (/eads.) 
“Work is the apotheosis of humanity.” (Enter 
CaRRI®, R.) Wish I had that man here, I’d make 
him hunt up that word in the dictionary. Oh, I 
know what I’lldo. Carrie, run to mamma and tell 
her to look up this word in the dictionary— 
“apotheosis.” (CARRIE starts toward L.) Letme 
hear you say it ; careful, now. 
Carriz. Oh, I can say it fast enough—pap 
sees sis. (Hzit L., running.) 
Orator (laughing). Well, well, now she has 
made a mess of it. But no matter. I'll let the 
word go. What difference does it make, any- 
way? It’s a good, high-sounding word. (Reads.) 
“Work is the apotheosis of humanity. The man 
or woman without work to do is a ship without an 
anchor, a lighthouse without aluminary.” Good- 
ness, why couldn’t he have said lamp? “A

single moment ; here I am with this speech to give 
to-night and expecting the boys any moment for 
rehearsal. I do believe they are coming now. I 
told them to walk right in without ringing. (Zhe 
trades enter R. ORATOR rises, greets each one 
familiarly and shakes hands down theline. They 
drop into the chairs placed about stage. ORATOR 
returns to table, takes up manuscript and with 
back to R., remains standing.) Well, boys, glad 
indeed to see so many of the unions represented. 
Of course you will all be on hand to-night, arrayed 
just as you are this morning. I have my speech 
all written out here, although it is not quite com- 
mitted to memory. It has a good opening. 
Listen to this, and see if you don’t agree with me. 
(Reads from manuscript.) “Work is the great 
apotheosis of humanity. The man or woman 
without work to do is a ship without an anchor, a 
lighthouse without a luminary, a panegyrist with- 
out a subject, a potentate without a realm, a 
surveyor without a circumferentor (business of 
stumbling over word ), a quadrant without a vernier, 
a cheval-de-frise without a spike.” (Looks up, then 
aside.) They all look as if they understood every 
word of it. Well, maybe they do. I’ve often 
heard it said that the American working man is the

most intelligent being on earth. (Zo them.) 
Now, boys, that will do for the opening. _T’ll not 
give you any more of that part now. What do 
you think of it? (Ald exclaim, “ Good, fine, ex- 
cellent.”) But as it is very important that you 
should have what the actors call the cue (begins to 
shuffle papers), we will pass on to the last sentence. 
WIFE (enters L., running; catches him by 
coat collar). Oh, you will, will you? I guess 
not. You'll pass right out to the wood-shed and 
split that kindling. (Jerks him around and pushes 
him off stage L. Manuscript is scattered over floor ; 
one of men starts to pick it up.) No, let it be. 
Maybe it won’t hurt the floor any, and I’m sure 
no one will try to steal it. 
CaRPENTER (politely). Will he soon return, 
madam ? 
Wire. Well, I think not. It’s my intention 
to keep him busy for the next hour or two. 
Painter. But excuse me, madam, he invited 
us here for some sort of a rehearsal. 
Buacksmitu. We were to hear his speech in 
order to know just when to appear on the stage 
to-night, to get our cue, you know. 
WIFE (gathering up manuscript). Well, if the 
cue is all you want, I can give you that. I have 
heard him tell it over often enough. You are to 
come on the stage when he speaks the last word. 
Guess you don’t need any rehearsal for that. 
Yowll be glad enough when you hear it. He
-P-A-G-E-192

just invited you here so that he might practice 
that everlasting old speech on you. I know him. 
Farmer. But, madam, perhaps you wouldn’t 
mind telling us what the last word or the last 
phrase of the speech is, so that we will be ready 
when we hear it. 
Wire. The last phrase ought to be “ stuff and 
nonsense,” but I don’t suppose it is. (Looks at 
manuscript.) No, here is the whole of the last 
sentence. “ And so, my friends, I close as I began, 
‘Work is the apotheosis of humanity.’” Umph, 
much he knows about it. Anyway, if he thinks 
it’s such a fine thing I should think he’d do a 
little more of it. Ten chances to one he’s leaning 
on his ax now saying over and over that ridiculous 
speech. He hasn’t known anything else for a 
week. (Slams manuscript upon table and exit L.) 
CaRPENTER. Well, now that she is gone I 
suppose it will do no harm to rehearse our lines 
and actions. We are not likely to be together 
again before this evening. 
(They come to 0., and standing in careless attitudes 
each one makes motions appropriate to his trade, 
either with or without the tools, as most con- 
venient, at the same time repeating in concert 
these lines.)

Each will bravely do his part, 
Strong of arm, and light of heart. 
Other hands may whiter be, 
From all stain of labor free, 
But no other hands so strong 
Push the car of wealth along. 
Statesmen wise the land may need, 
Men whose counsel all will heed. 
But no cunning words can pour 
From the earth its hidden store. 
Brawny arms and hands must give 
All by which we mortals live.

On the men in overalls.

  THE PUMPKINS 
(A Song and Drill for Thanksgiving Day) 
CHARACTERS.—TWELVE PuMPKINS, twelve girls 
Srom ten to fourteen years of age. 
CostumEs.—Each girl carries in left hand a 
large pumpkin leaf and stem, made of stiff green 
paper. They should be made by the same person 
in order to secure uniformity. The stem of each 
leaf should be at least two feet long. The dresses 
must be of yellow cheese-cloth, loose, and very 
full. Each one is trimmed around the bottom with 
a wide band of green ; the sleeves are of the same 
green, fitting the arms closely. For the head 
covering use a large, square piece of yellow crépe 
paper matching the dress in shade. Cut holes for 
the eyes and nose. Envelop the head loosely in 
this paper, tie it around the neck with narrow 
green ribbon, leaving long ends that will fly about 
when the characters move. Pull the paper out 
around the head, giving the effect of rotundity. 
Much will depend upon the skill with which this 
head covering is arranged. All should wear tan 
shoes and stockings; the hosiery should be as 
nearly as possible of the same shade. As pump- 
kins vary but little in color, be careful that all the 
dresses and also all the head covering and sleeves

effect. 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS 
The Pumpkins march upon the stage in time to 
lively music, standing in line across the stage while 
singing the following song, observing the motions 
as here indicated. These motions should be prac- 
ticed repeatedly until they can be given in perfect 
unison. 
(a) All bow very low. 
(6) Smack lips noisily. 
(c) Lean first to right side, then to the left. 
(d) Point to the audience, first straight ahead, 
then to right, then to left. 
(e) Throw arms about. 
(f) Reach both arms first to right, then to 
left. 
(g) Stretch out each arm. 
(A) Bring hands and arms together in front as 
closely as possible. 
Be careful that the girls are arranged accord- 
ing to height.

(Tune: ‘‘ Learn a Little Every Day,’ page 13, 
“Merry Melodies.” ) 
Pumpkins are a handsome color, 
This must be our only pride. 
Watch us now as here we greet you (a) 
Standing closely side by side.

Dear Thanksgiving Day is coming, 
Wea willing tribute fall. 
In rich pies you’ll next behold us, 
Pumpkin pies, (>) the best of all. 
*Twas for this through all the summer 
(ce) Patiently we grew and grew, 
Just to make a toothsome dainty 
(zd) For you, and you, and for you. 
Now, pray, watch us in our movements, 
Little grace have we to show, 
But we’re working, always working, 
Everything must work to grow. 
(e) And so we throw our vines about 
(f) Reaching here, and reaching there, 
Untii you say, “those pumpkin vines 
Are encroaching everywhere.” 
So while beneath the summer sun, 
(g) We go spreading all around,

All the brown unlovely ground. 
When the song is finished march music is 
played, the characters “right about face,” march 
off to right. When the head girl comes to centre 
of stage she stops and marks time; the others 
wind about her, each marking time as she reaches 
the centre; when all are thus formed in a group, 
the last one marches off and they unwind, form- 
ing into a large circle spreading around the stage ; 
they mark time in this way through three meas- 
ures of music. They then march around by each

TEN LITTLE CRANBERRIES 
(Motion Song and Drill for Thanksgiving Day) 
This little exercise may be given by eighteen 
girls or ten boys. The costumes must be made of 
dark red paper cambric, with the shiny side out. 
For the girls, short, full dresses, “ Mother Hub- 
bard,” with tight-fitting sleeves; for the boys, 
blouses and short, full “knickers.” Both wear 
red shoes and stockings, also round caps made of 
stiff red paper. Each child carries in right hand 
a large iron spoon. The children are discovered 
at rise, standing in a line as near the front as is 
necessary to make room for the next movement. 
A large screen stands at centre behind the row of 
children. At each point indicated in the song by 
a letter, a child disappears behind the screen, 
the first one going from the right, the second 
from the left, and so on, in alternation. They 
take their places behind the screen in a line, run- 
ning to rear of the stage, at a right angle to the 
line first formed. When the children are all be- 
hind the screen, it is withdrawn by the teacher, and 
the last two lines of the song are sung. Care 
must be taken that the “ one little cranberry ” left 
alone on the stage is the one best fitted for the 
solo part. At the close of the song march music

But you must know it is even worse than that.

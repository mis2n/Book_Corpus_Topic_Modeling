  PREFACE 
Tue criteria and methods by which textbooks should be selected 
are of paramount importance in the success of public education. 
Professional educators, publishers, textbook commissions, legis- 
lators, and laymen are paying more attention to this subject than 
ever before. This pamphlet is presented with the hope of (1) facili- 
tating and improving the selection of textbooks and (2) of motivat- 
ing some further study to the problems suggested here. 
How Tuis Pamputet May Be Usep 
It may be of interest for those working in education to know 
' that the Form for Reviewing Textbooks which is presented in 
Chapter III has been used successfully (1) as a means of intro- 
ducing the criteria for selecting textbooks in teacher training and 
administration courses, the students reviewing different books and 
presenting their recorded judgments in the classroom; (2) as a 
basis for faculty meetings in both elementary and high schools, 
different teachers having reviewed various books used in the schools 
before the meetings; (3) for comparing books proposed as school 
texts before state, county, and local textbook commissions, and 
(4) as a means of reviewing books for publishing companies.

  CHAPTER I 
Tue DEVELOPMENT OF CRITERIA AND DEVICES FOR EVALUATING 
TEXTBOOKS 
Durine the last few years there has been a growing realization 
among educators that more objective data are needed for the 
accurate evaluation and scientific selection of school texts. This 
feeling is evidenced by such works as ‘‘The Textbook” by Hall- 
Quest, published in 1918; ‘The Selection of Textbooks” by 
Maxwell, presented in 1921; the work of Franzen and Knight 
entitled ‘Textbook Selection,’’ published in 1922, and the study 
by Bamberger entitled ‘“‘The Effect of the Physical Make-Up 
of a Book upon Children’s Selection,’ which also appeared in 
1922. While each of these writers has recognized certain basic 
criteria that should be considered in selecting texts, none of them 
has suggested a very definite procedure to be followed in applying 
these criteria to all books. A brief résumé of these studies follows. 
Professor Hall-Quest, in Chapter IV of his book, presents what he 
calls ‘Some General Standards for Textbook Adoption.”” Follow- 
ing these are offered some specific standards for judging texts in 
arithmetic, general mathematics, reading, spelling, language, 
history, and Latin. Chapter VI, entitled “The Textbook as a 
Guide,” and Chapter VII, called ‘‘The Textbook as a Source of 
Knowledge,” furnish additional material which just as properly 
could have been included under ‘‘Some General Standards for 
Textbook Adoption” in Chapter IV. ‘‘The’Textbook as a Means 
of Interpreting Truth” is the name given to Chapter VIII, and 
here again Dr. Hall-Quest has presented some criteria that should 
be applied to any proposed school text. The suggestion of analyz- 
ing the contents of textbooks as to the proportional distribution 
of subject matter is very good indeed. The amount of space 
c
-P-A-G-E-8
devoted to the different phases of a particular subject,should be 
one of the most potent determinants in the selection of textbooks, 
and Professor Hall-Quest has provided a form for use in this 
connection. 
Although Professor Hall-Quest has treated the standards for 
textbooks in an exhaustive and thorough fashion, with the excep- 
tion of a rather limited score card for judging arithmetics, no device 
is offered for the observation of these suggested standards in the 
practical problem of evaluating and choosing proposed school texts. 
Professor Maxwell, in “The Selection of Textbooks,” lays the 
burden of emphasis on a method for applying textbook standards ; 
making a much less exhaustive treatment of what these standards 
are than did Dr. Hall-Quest. ‘ Outline Aids for Judging All Texts ug 
is the scheme that Professor Maxwell suggests as a means of judg- 
ing all texts. This outline provides for the judging of a book on 
the bases of : 
1. Publication. 
2. Mechanical construction. 
3. Content. 
4. Use. 
Each of these elements is divided into several subdivisions and the 
form (a portion of which is shown here) provides for the rating of 
each item as Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor.

  Following the “‘ Outline Aids for Judging All Texts” there is a 
series of “Special Outlines in Evaluating Texts in Different Sub- 
jects.” In this series the author has presented forms for evaluat- 
ing texts in each of the following subjects: Reading, arithmetic, 
language, spelling, geography, history, civics, drawing, music, pen- 
manship, algebra, geometry, science, and foreign language. While 
there is variation among these different outlines as to the wording, 
all of the elements in each separate form could be classified under 
the following headings : 
1. Content (subject matter). 
2. Style, organization and form of presentation. 
3. Adaptability. 
As in the “Outline for Judging All Texts,” the items in the special 
outlines are to be classified as Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor. 
The work of Dr. Maxwell is worthy of the highest praise. While 
Dr. Maxwell has not resorted to a statistical treatment of the 
study, he has recognized that there are certain criteria that should 
be applied to all books proposed as school texts. He, as did Dr. 
Hall-Quest, has also shown that there is a good deal of variance 
between different texts in relation to the general standards. Dr. 
Maxwell has opened the way for the development of a general score 
card for reviewing and evaluating all school textbooks. 
Dr. Franzen and Professor Knight have accepted the principles 
that have just been discussed. They state that “the major 
criteria for the selection of textbooks are five,’ and each element 
is weighted so that a perfect textbook in respect to these elements 
would be assigned a value of tooo. These five criteria with 
their weightings are : 
(a) Interest — 200 
(b) Comprehension — 250 
(c) Permanent value of subject matter — 250 
(d) Value of method — 200 
(e) Mechanical elements — 100 
Each of these elements is subdivided and a “Tentative Score 
3
-P-A-G-E-10
  
  Card for Judging Value of Biology” is offered. Educators are - 
urged to give preference in the selection of school texts to ‘‘objec- 
tive evidence” over “subjective opinion.” In reality, however, 
Dr. Franzen and Professor Knight, as did Professor Hall-Quest 
and Professor Maxwell, suggest a technique of marshaling sub- 
jective opinion in such a way that it becomes objective data. 
In Chapter IT the criterion of ‘‘interest”” is applied to high school 
English literature texts, and in Chapter III the criterion of ‘‘com- 
prehension”’ is applied to geography texts for elementary schools. 
The methods employed in these two studies are as strikingly unique 
as they are scientific. As the authors suggest, there is great need 
for additional studies of such a nature. Despite its value it is 
unfortunate that such a work should fail to provide a bibliography 
and an index. Also when the mechanical make-up of a book 
plays such a potent part in its success 100 points seem a low value 
to assign to that element. 
Eventually many, if not all administrative practices relating 
to the control of schools will be justified on the basis of such scien- 
tific technique as that used in ‘‘Textbook Selection.’’ Such 
studies should be made as frequently as possible by those who are 
professionally trained for such work. At present, however, be- 
cause of lack of trained staffs and inadequate laboratory facilities, 
the statistical procedure utilized by Dr. Franzen and Dr. Knight 
is utterly unfeasible for immediate use by the rank and file of those 
who select and use textbooks. 
Dr. Bamberger’s study entitled ‘“The Effect of the Physical 
Make-Up of a Book upon Children’s Selection” presents dif- 
ferent experiments which were conducted in order to determine : 
First, does the physical make-up of a book, its general outward 
appearance, have any influence at all in causing children to desire 
it? Second, what are the factors in the general make-up of a book 
that are potent in pleasing children in the first three grades of the 
primary school ? 
Such factors as the size of the book, the number and character 
of illustrations, the amount of stories contained in a given volume 
4
-P-A-G-E-11
  ‘were considered. In addition to these, an attempt was made to 
discover if a very good textbook in reading was as apt to be 
chosen voluntarily by children as an interesting book not in text- 
book form. 
The general conclusions which were drawn from her study will 
be found in Chapter II.
-P-A-G-E-12
CHAPTER II 
Present NEEps In EvatuatTinG TEXTBOOKS 
Ir was pointed out in Chapter I that there is an ever increas- 
ing realization of the necessity for definite and objective criteria 
for textbook selection. It was also noted that at present the 
majority of the bases and methods by which textbooks are meas- 
ured are individual judgments of the extent to which a book 
meets the essential requisites for a good text. The value of a 
textbook when measured by any of the existing score cards like- 
wise depends on individual judgments in respect to the different 
elements of the score card or outline. Ifa score card is to be of 
adequate service it must furnish a means of recording data upon 
which the scorer can base the values that are assigned to the 
different elements of the score card. The value of such a provi- 
sion is proved by the first three pages of the Strayer-Engelhardt 
“Score Card for City School Buildings.”* None of the available 
score cards or outlines for judging textbooks provides any device 
for the collection and compilation of data necessary in the evalua- 
tion of a book. As a consequence, it is possible for some very 
essential data to be neglected in assigning quantitative values to 
the different factors considered in existing score cards for the 
measurement of textbooks. 
It is obvious that some form must be provided for recording 
and compiling individual judgments as to the worth of different 
proposed school texts. Great and many are the needs of such a 
form. Educational experts are being asked to evaluate the courses

of study and textbooks in school surveys as well as the many other 
elements of educational systems that have already been studied. 
Administrators, teachers, and students of education all feel the need 
of a device that may be used for collecting and recording opinions 
in order that a textbook may be judged with equity, This need 
was expressed by George A. Bassford, principal of the high school 
in Ashland, Wisconsin, in the November issue of the ‘‘ American 
School Board Journal.’”’ Instructors in education in both normal 
schools and universities are ever decrying the lack of a convenient 
and objective means for reviewing textbooks that they may use in 
such courses as Methods of Instruction and The Technique of 
Teaching. Prospective teachers are at a loss for a means of 
judging texts while they are students in teacher training courses. 
As most school systems have been organized, individual class- 
room teachers have had little or no direct control in the selection 
of school textbooks. However, with the increasing degree of 
teacher participation in school administration, classroom teachers 
in elementary as well as high schools are becoming the choosers 
of school texts. Consequently they more than any other group of 
professional educators need some convenient device for recording 
their opinion when asked by their principal or superintendent to 
review some book and pass upon the advisability of using it in some 
particular grade or school. 
Publishers of textbooks, as well as textbook commissions, are 
far from being in agreement as to the essential requirements 
school texts should fulfill, As was pointed out by all of the 
authors mentioned in Chapter I, too often a salesman’s speech, 
the number of cents each book costs, or a good dinner followed by a 
pleasing theater party are given too much weight in the selection 
of school textbooks. 
The form presented in Chapter III is the initial step in the 
compilation and standardization of ‘‘A Score Card with Standards 
for Evaluating Textbooks.” As has been observed no standards 
have been presented here. For these criteria the following should 
receive the reader’s most careful consideration :

* Dr. Bamberger’s major conclusions are of sufficient value to merit quoting ; 
ten of the eleven being as follows: 
1. The physical make-up of a book does exert influence upon children’s 
selections. 
2. Size appears to be a factor in book selection. The small, diminutive 
volume does not appeal as strongly as a larger book. The size most acceptable 
to the children in the primary grades appears to be about seven and one-half 
inches long by five inches wide and one inch thick. There needs to be further 
experimenting, however, to decide if a larger book would be more acceptable 
than this. These experiments had no book larger than the above. 
3. The cover appears to be a factor in determining children’s selection. 
The color of the cover exerts an influence. Brightness is a pleasing factor for 
children. Blue, red, and yellow are the favorite colors for covers. 
4. Titles are an additional factor influencing book selection. 
5. The internal arrangement of books also influences choices. (a) Nu- 
merous illustrations make a book acceptable to children. 25% of the book 
space seems the minimum amount of space to be devoted to pictures to make a 
book acceptable for little children. Large, full-page pictures are preferred to 
smaller ones inserted irregularly in the text. (6) Colors preferred by the 
younger children are rather crude and elementary, having a high degree of 
8
-P-A-G-E-15
  saturation and a great deal of brightness. Older children gradually grow into 
a preference for softer tints and tones. (c) Humor and action in pictures make 
an appeal to primary children. (d) Pictures that have story-telling qualities 
have a high attraction. (e) A fair number of stories in a familiar field attract 
children to a book. 
6. The short interest span of primary children seems to be a psychological 
explanation for their preference for not many lines on any one page. For the 
same reason a wide margin appears to be attractive; an average width of at 
least one inch should be used. 
7. There were very few sex differences observable. Girls show a slightly 
greater appreciation of more artistic illustrations than do boys. Small books 
are better liked by girls than by boys. In examining the subjective reasons 
given by the children, very slight sex differences can be noted. The name of 
the heroine of a story appealed to the girls more than to the boys. This 
seems to bear out the conclusion that the feminine sex is more interested in 
people than in things. The name of an implement, the Stone Arrow, appealed 
more strongly to the boys than to the girls. 
8. There are some slight grade differences. The first grades differ from 
the older children rather considerably in lack of artistic appreciation of pic- 
tures; in greater fondness for diminutive volumes; in greater fondness for 
crude, primary colors. The second and third grades exhibit very similar 
tastes with regard to books. . 
g. Adults appear to estimate children’s book preferences most inaccurately. 
Men’s judgments concerning what children like in the way of books are slightly 
better than are the women’s judgments. 
1o. Titles appear to exert an influence with all the children. The word 
“reader”’ in a title appears to exert a negative influence upon the older primary 
children. More pleasing and suggestive titles on textbooks might make them 
more acceptable to the patrons for whom they are designed.

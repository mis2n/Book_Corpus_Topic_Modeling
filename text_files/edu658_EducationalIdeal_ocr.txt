  PREFACE. 
———_+Oo——— 
Tue following outline of a special phase of development 
in the history of education is not only incomplete, but also, 
in a measure, fragmentary. Inadequate as it is, however, 
the author issues it in the belief that it enters a territory 
in educational literature not yet fully explored. It seems 
to him that this territory must be thoroughly known before 
the present questions in education can be wholly understood, 
and he hopes that his sketch may lead to an abler study 
and treatment of this field of human growth. 
He begs to acknowledge the valuable assistance and 
advice given by President Walker of the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, by Dr. Dickinson, late Secretary of 
the Massachusetts State Board of Education, and especially 
by Professor Hinsdale of the University of Michigan, who 
has reviewed and criticised the manuscript and proof of 
the entire book.

THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL. 
CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION. 
“HUMAN LIMITATIONS; A ‘‘NATURAL’’ EDUCATION; GROWTH OF THE 
EDUCATIONAL IDEAL; ITS OBSCURITY ; ITS ‘‘HEROES’’; ITS ENE- 
MIES: MEDIZVALISM ; CLASSICISM ; FEUDALISM; ECCLESIASTICISM ; 
MATERIALISM, 
In few things are human limitations more evident than 
in our judgments of human progress. Our every step is 
accepted as one in a new direction; our every idea is 
advanced as one of a new growth. With us, we incline to 
think, all real reform has begun. Especially is this true, 
‘to-day, of educational questions, to whose solving we be- 
lieve ourselves peculiarly anointed. We feel that to us, for 
the first time in history, true.pedagogic inspiration has come, 
and that from our hands, after centuries of neglect and 
misunderstanding, the child is, at last, to receive right 
education. 
It is to remind ourselves of the falseness and narrowness 
of this attitude that I have ventured to sketch the growth 
of the educational ideal, and to trace the steps through 
which it expanded from the narrow pedantry of the School- 
men into an ever broader understanding of the true function 
1

of teaching. In so doing, I hope to show that the perma- 
nent influences upon the growth of this educational ideal 
have been those alone which paid some heed to the natural 
development of man, that gave some study to the normal 
growth of the child, that tended, in short, towards what I 
must call, for want of a better term, a “natural” education. 
A natural education is not one, as is too often supposed, 
in which the child is left to grow up as he may, subject to 
the chances of his environment, a prey to his own inclina- 
tions. It is not one in which he is kept aloof from man, in 
a forced communion with non-human things. Neither is it 
one unwisely trusted to the instincts of a natural, but un- 
trained affection. Still less is it one in which the old ped- 
agogic drill in formal studies is thrown aside to give place 
to a pseudo-scientific playing, a vague and formless potter- 
ing with objective phenomena. The real “natural” educa- 
tion is that aimed at in the best endeavor of to-day, in 
which the child, from the moment of his birth, is steadily, 
rationally, and intelligently developed, by trained and sym- 
pathetic minds, towards the best manhood possible to him. 
Such an education is not simply mental; it is physical; 
above all, it is moral. In it, the child’s individuality is 
preserved, but is pruned and guided; he himself furnishes 
the impulse towards his own development, but the channels 
in which this force acts, the ends towards which it directs 
itself, are determined for him. A natural education is one 
in which the subject taught is secondary to the manner of 
teaching; in which the task done is subsidiary to the effect 
of doing it; in which the question to be asked at the com- 
pletion of an educational step is not, What has the child 
learned? but, What has the child become? 
Far from presuming to outline, in so short a space, the 
history of modern education, I do not aim at a full analysis 
of even this one phase of it. Indeed, the history of educa-

tion, as of all social forces, is not to be grasped by any one 
man or group of men. It has been a balancing of hidden 
tendencies rather than a chronicle of observed attainments. 
The educational standard is at once a motive and a measure 
of social change. While the evolution of matter’is marked 
by milestones of transitional types, in the evolution of mind 
there are no fixed records of progress. A fossil bone may 
unfold the life-history of a large body of mammalia, but not 
all the memoirs and letters of the eighteenth century, not 
all its state papers and secret archives, can show us when 
and how its bad standards of civilization began to grow into 
the still imperfect, but better, standards of to-day. While 
it is true that mankind, not men, make history, it is no less 
true that the only beacons in the onward sweep of the 
human flood are men. Without the “hero,” as Carlyle calls 
him, to mark history, we should be swirled on in the torrent 
of events, ignorant of the vaguest outlines of a channel, 
powerless even to conjecture whence we came or whither we 
are going. 
But “heroes” are more than historical landmarks. 
They are important agents in the universal plan.’ As con- 
1‘¢Tn all epochs of the world’s history, we shall find the Great 
Man to have been the indispensable saviour of his epoch ; — the light- 
ning, without which the fuel never would have burnt. The History 
of the World, I said already, was the Biography of Great Men.’’? — 
Car.tyLz, Heroes and Hero-Worship (Chicago, 1891), Lect. I. 21. 
‘¢ Historians are very right in attending solely to great men; they 
should only be careful not to represent them as anything that they are 
not; they should represent them, not as the masters, but as the repre- 
sentatives of those who do not appear. ... Under this reservation it 
is certain, that as every people resolves itself into its great men of all 
kinds, the history of a people ought to consist, as it does consist, in 
the history of its great men.’ — Victor Cousin, Introduction to the 
History of Philosophy (Linberg’s translation ; Boston, 1832), Lect. 
X. 302.
-P-A-G-E-12
4 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL. 
ceived by our limited faculties, all sciences —or history in. 
its broadest sense — are but fragments of a universal science. 
to which man may or may not ultimately attain. Research 
and speculation, the farther they go, tend to strengthen more 
fully the belief that man’s feeble mind, able now to examine 
life only in detail, disconnectedly, may gain, in future ages, 
the power of looking at the world as a whole, of taking 
such a bird’s-eye view, so to speak, of creation, that its plan 
shall be comprehensible. Only then can there be devised a 
perfect method of education, in conformity with nature. To 
bring forward this condition, to assemble the results of the 
patient toil of specialists, master minds are sent into the 
world. Without them to generalize and to show us to what 
point man has come, progress in knowledge would be well- 
nigh impossible. Each scholar, having explored his little 
patch, having mapped its topography, would then rest con- 
tent, oblivious to its relations to other patches explored by 
other men. The master mind, however, is gifted with the 
power to extract the essentials of other men’s labor, and, 
grouping them together, to show, in one broad, luminous 
plan, so large an area, so perfect a section, that the rotun- 
dity of the sphere of knowledge is at once made plain. 
Then it is that men begin to dream of a sight of the eternal 
. cosmos, and, with new light and strength, to work for its: 
attainment. 
Treating, then, for the sake of concreteness, the progress” 
of “natural” education as a series of revolutions led by 
men, rather than as a noiseless expansion of mankind, we 
‘taay say that the first revolt of education, in modern days, 
was against medievalism. This, in its broader aspect, was 
that social change which we call the Renaissance. From 
the many great leaders crowding this period, Rabelais stands 
out as the champion of the new education, not because he 
laid greater stress upon education than did many others, not

because.his educational ideas were more formal or more orig- 
inal; but because his vision was broader, his weapons were 
keener, his warfare was more effective. Not content with 
attacking local abuses and temporary wrongs, he levelled 
his satire at the sins which had begotten them. He battled, 
not with the imps of darkness and the brood of hell, but: 
with darkness and hell themselves. In his warfare against 
medizevalism, the time-spirit was with him; but in his 
visions of reconstruction, he looked far beyond his age. 
Upon the ruins that he and his had made, there was built: 
up a new educational temple, a classic one; but it was dedi-. 
cated to gods as false as those of the. Middle Ages, though: 
infinitely less. cruel than they. The classicism of the Re- 
naissance, upon which the schooling of that period rested, 
was as foreign to the real science and art of education as 
was scholasticism, 
In turn, the monopoly over education which, through the 
Renaissance, the classicists secured, was shattered, —in 
England by Bacon, in France by Descartes. As the elder 
—and as the better — leader in this second revolt, I have 
chosen Bacon.’ 
1 Descartes was, without doubt, the greater thinker, and from him, 
more than from Bacon, came that impulse towards pure and ordered 
thought which was to be so beneficial to civilization. But. Bacon, it 
seems to me, exerted a wider influence upon social progress, for the 
very reason that he was not altogether ahead of his time. He was 
tinged with current superstition, his experimentation was desultory 
and often puerile, his genius was diffusive and, therefore, not always 
effective. Nevertheless, as, similarly, in the case of Franklin, — 
whose scientific attainments were far inferior to those of many of his 
contemporaries, and whose philosophy was certainly not of a high 
order, — the union in him of homeliness and genius made just that 
bridge which was needed between the rank superstition of the Eliza- 
bethan age and the truly scientific spirit, misdirected as it often was,. 
of the materialistic generations which followed. 
The obvious objection to Descartes which might be made in this
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL. 
Medizvalism and classicism weakened, there remained 
feudalism to be cleared away before the light could reach 
mankind. This work, begun by Luther, was taken up, on 
the educational side, by Comenius, the founder of real pub- 
lic education. His theories, adorned and refined by Mon- 
taigne, co-ordinated and made scientific by Locke, spread 
slowly, through these men, from Germany and Scandinavia, 
where Comenius had planted them, into France and England. 
Beaten in the open, medizvalism and classicisin took 
refuge in the Church, and, in a bad alliance, were re- 
enthroned by the Jesuits. From this new power, Jansenism 
deposed them, never again to reign. 
These successive shocks to the old order of things had 
practically destroyed the educational city, leaving its inhabi- 
tants, the children, naked upon a desert of materialism. 
To this point, the process had been chiefly one of destruc- 
tion. From this point, it was to be one mainly of construc- 
tion. The first architect of the new city which is rising 
upon the dust of the old, was Rousseau. He laid the foun- 
connection, that he was a founder of idealism, not of realism, would 
not bea valid one. Whatever the ultimate effect of his teachings, their 
immediate influence was not greatly different from that of Bacon's. 
Both these leaders of thought freed men from tradition by making 
them self-active ; in so doing they accomplished all that, at this stage 
of progress, was necessary. 
It is interesting to observe that most, if not all, of the French 
biographers of Descartes are special pleaders. Premising the un- 
doubted superiority of Descartes as an investigator and organizer of 
scientific thought, they try to prove his superiority to Bacon in every- 
thing. His latest biographer, M. Alfred Fouillée, would even persuade 
us that Descartes anticipated the distinctive researches, among lesser 
men, of Newton, of Kant, and of Darwin. 
See, in this connection, the very vivid, though somewhat forced, 
characterization of Bacon, Descartes, and Leibnitz in De Gérando’s 
Histoire comparée des systémes de philosophie (Paris, 1804), T. I. 284.

dations and shaped the plan upon which later builders 
wrought. His errors were rectified by Pestalozzi, by Froe- 
bel, by the philosophers and psychologists, by the legion of 
schoolmasters, and, not least, by the myriad women who, 
after Rousseau, took their part in educational work, —a 
part essential to sound and rapid progress.’ 
Dealing, therefore, with these successive educational 
“heroes,” I shall consider, as types and leaders in edu- 
cational progress, Rabelais, Francis Bacon, Comenius, 
Montaigne, Locke, the Jansenists, Fénelon, Rousseau, Pes- 
talozzi, Froebel, and, collectively, women. 
10f these forces I must, to my regret, wholly neglect one. The 
influence upon education of the philosophers and psychologists of our 
century is too wide and too abstruse a problem to be considered here.

ACCOMPLISHED ; HIS STYLE. 
To understand fully the growth from ancient to modern 
ideals, one ought to be able to elucidate the Middle Ages; 
for in them, as well as in the elder civilizations, lie the roots 
of modern knowledge. Were these, the so-called Dark Ages, 
a necessary stage in human progress, a sort of interregnum 
pending the birth of new forces? Was it essential to progress 
that humanity should, on the intellectual side, lie fallow for 
centuries in order to produce, in the after years, a richer 
harvest? Or were the Middle Ages a mere grouping of 
circumstances, a logical result of themselves, a successive 
rebirth from their own spawning? However these ques- 
tions may be answered, it is plain that there existed a long 
period of outward intellectual darkness following the time 
of the Fathers of the Church, that it continued till the 
period of Charlemagne, when there was a faint, spasmodic

of Charlemagne’s court, and the monk Alcuin is not seldom dubbed

resurrection of learning, that it dragged on till Abélard? 
and the scholastics proclaimed a false dawning, and that it 
extended well into the fifteenth century, when, at last, the 
sun of the new day rose. 
During this long period, such Christian education as 
existed was mainly of the Church. To prepare men for the 
religious life, not in the purer spirit of the Fathers, but in 
the bigotry of doctrine, was the main object of teaching. 
Learning and priesthood were almost synonymous, but the 
priest was cramped by instruction, not freed by study. The 
dry formalism and dead conning of words which the stand- 
ard of the Church entailed, led, inevitably, to the dreary 
hootings of scholasticism. This owlish learning, growing 
more outrageous as its metaphysics became more absurdly 
deep, soon lost all point of contact with humanity. Its 
husks of syllogism drove all appetite for real learning from 
the mind of the student, and he contented himself, ignorant 
of better intellectual food, with a smattering of Latin, a 
jargon of philosophy. In his sloven lips the Latin grew to 
be as false as the philosophy. Whatever the remote cause 
of the degradation preceding the Renaissance, its immediate 
source was, plainly, the low standard of education; for, 
when the sun of real learning dawned upon this intellectual 
his Minister of Public Instruction. While Charles, undoubtedly, 
made honest and serious endeavor to improve the condition of his 
household and his loosely federated subjects, it is easy to exaggerate 
both the extent and the success of his efforts. Where the mists of 
ignorance are as heavy as they were in the ninth century, even so 
small a rush-light as that burned at Aix-la-Chapelle casts gigantic 
reflections and is easily mistaken for an educational lighthouse.

morass, what seemed dead and corrupt was quickened, the 
means of growth — the printing-press, the compass, and a 
thousand other material aids — arose, and, in an instant, 
historically speaking, Europe was transformed, reformation 
came, naturalism gained place, and modern civilization 
began. - 
To resolve the myriad forces of the Renaissance, tracing 
each to its source and measuring its results, would be 
impossible. Every nation of Europe did its part in the 
work of promoting true learning, but from France, modern 
“ Mother of arts and eloquence,” came the first great prophet, 
the leader of revolt, the seer of real education, Francois 
Rabelais. He was the first modern pleader for the copart- 
nership of Nature in the bringing up of youth. No veil of 
tradition could blind him to the path which education should 
take. His words, true then, are no less true to-day. His 
plans, Utopian then, are far from their fulfilment now. 
Some one! compares Rabelais’s writings to a Gothic 
cathedral of the florid type. Viewed point by point, the 
building is cumbered with petty and curious detail; fancy, 
in its adornment, runs mad and grows obscene; incongruity 
is everywhere. But contemplate this mass from a distance, 
merge details in the outline of the whole, and there appears 
the perfection of architecture, the flower of the art. One 
must look at Rabelais in this way, seeing the beauty, the 
majesty, of his thought, forgetting the flippancy, the gro- 
tesqueness, the indecency, of its detailed form. 
The man was, in a measure, an outgrowth of his time. 
His character, individual as it was, received its mould from 
the forces of the hour. Moreover, he was a native of 
1 Lenient, La satire en France au XVI? siécle. ‘‘ Rabelais n’est 
point encore un disciple de l’architecture mathématique inaugurée par 
la Renaissance: il a tous les caprices, l’exubérante confusion et la 
riche prolixité de l’architecture gothique.”’
-P-A-G-E-19
  
  RABELAIS. 11 
Touraine, that fantastic garden of France, where extraordi- 
nary physical vitality is linked with wonderful imagination, 
astonishing fertility of resource, an inexhaustible fund of 
Gallic bonhommie. In these traits are all the elements of 
such a character as that of Rabelais: courage that could 
withstand the force of long-accepted doctrines, imagination 
that could set up and make real a world other than that 
known of tradition, laughing sunniness of temper that could 
carry reforms impossible to gravity and dulness. We fancy 
discerning in Rabelais some of the tavern-keeping spirit of 
his father, of the raillery and joviality, that, real or assumed, 
have always an eye to the business of the inn. 
Rabelais’s existence was no better—it was certainly 
no worse—than that of his contemporaries. He was a 
hanger-on of the Papal court while protesting against its 
abuses. He was, in youth, a scandal to a monastery itself 
scandalous. He enjoyed benefices won by cringing and 
kept by favor. He was unchaste in an age when chastity 
was unmanly. He was drunken in a time when sobriety 
was a reproach. He was slavish and sycophantic in an 
era and kingdom where these qualities were the surest 
means of success. His life was a continual denial of his 
teachings, or, better, his teachings were a stinging protest 
against the life that he and his fellows led. In the tumult 
of the breaking up of the old and the rearing of the new, 
he stands, a ribald prophet, preaching the new faith in the 
old tongue. 
That he knew himself a genius superior to his age, is 
undoubted. Such satire as his sprang from a.mind that 
must have gauged its power and despised its surroundings. 
Such blows as his came from a hand that felt itself gigantic. 
The spurious death scene, in which he exclaims, “ Drop the 
curtain; the farce is played,” expresses his attitude. He 
had lived a farce. Knowing such great things, he had done 
 
-P-A-G-E-20

such mean ones. ‘To such vision as his, the sixteenth cen- 
tury was a vulgar masque, a carnival of beastly appetites 
and low aims, played by men of god-like possibilities. 
Born the son of an inn-keeper?! in Chinon, that obscure 
cradle of the Plantagenets,? he dies the friend of popes and 
kings, the idol of all save those whom he had scourged. 
Vowed in early life to St. Francis, he becomes, in middle 
age, a Benedictine with large benefices. Arrayed with the 
Reformers, he escapes their usual fate, and expires in the 
full material enjoyment, if not in the full odor, of sanctity. 
Attacking the Church as few others in France had dared to 
do, he remains to the last a protégé of Rome. His patron, 
Du Bellay,* falls at the accession of Henry II., but Rabelais 
1 Rabelais’s early history is very vague. It is generally believed 
that his father was an inn-keeper, although some authorities maintain 
that Rabelais was the son of an apothecary, while it is not impossible 
that the two vocations were united. Nothing is known of his mother, 
and even the date of his birth is in dispute. If in 1483, then many 
years of his life cannot be accounted for, and his books must have 
been finished in extreme old age. If, on the other hand, the date 1495 
is accepted, there is difficulty in reconciling it with trustworthy 
tradition. 
2 Geoffrey, son of Fulk the Black, was the first of the Counts of 
Anjou to receive the nickname “Plantagenet.’? He it was who 
married Matilda, the widowed empress, and wecaine, by her, the father 
of the future Henry II. of England.

gains rather than loses by Francis’s death.1_ Hated alike 
by good Catholic and rigid Calvinist, he withstands their 
clashing wrath. The storm that he aroused seemed power- 
less to reach him, falling on lesser figures, not on his. He 
was too worldly to sacrifice himself, too keen to commit 
himself, too powerful to be suppressed. He passed through 
the tempest of the Reformation, one of its foremost figures, 
one of its hardest fighters, with no hurt to himself. He 
was bold as Luther, but he possessed nothing of Luther’s 
martyr-spirit. He exposed the Church with his right 
hand while clutching her favors with his left. He was 
first a man of the world, only incidentally a reformer. 
Both he and Luther were strong because they reached 
the people, but their channels of influence ran in opposite 
ways. 
His medical career, wherein, in middle life, he studied at 
Montpellier? and practised at Lyons, was characteristic, 
not only proving the marvellous facility of his mind, but 
showing how adroitly he could shift the frock for the gown 
and the gown for the frock, as better served his immediate 
ends. ‘To the close of his life he practised medicine, while 
remaining a priest, and, passing his declining years in the 
cure of Meudon, he was still Doctor Rabelais. To this 
chameleon grasp of opportunity his safety in those ticklish 
times was due. His work as a physician, moreover, turned 
his mind to writing. His vast erudition, enriched by medi-

  14 THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL. 
cal research, the freedom of study and analysis permitted 
in the schools of healing, his work in editing old texts, _— 
combined to lead him to authorship. Well after the middle 
point of life, he composed, in the intervals of a busy exist- 
ence, “while eating and drinking,” as he expresses it, the 
five books which have made him immortal. 
The Pantagrveline books are of the type of the second 
part of Faust. There is a like, though lesser, intellectual 
sweep, a similar lack of continuity, a like evidence of 
growth out of a different and smaller scheme. There is, in 
both, a strange mingling of the human and superhuman, 
adding to the strength while taking from the unity of the 
design. As in Goethe’s masterpiece, one’s interest is not 
so much in the theme or in the characters as in the 
summing-up of humanity, the propounding of the hardest 
questions of existence. Each is a growth, not a creation. 
Each is a philosophy rather than a romance. 
The manner of their composition is interesting, and is 
plainly to be traced. First appeared,’ in satire of the 
extravagant romances of the day, the Chronique Gargantuine. 
A year or two later,? was published the first book of 
Pantagruel, still extravagant, still monstrous, but dealing 
with eternal problems. Both meeting with extraordinary 
success, the Chronique was rewritten to serve as an intro- 
duction to Pantagruel, which became, thereafter, the second 
book. This enlarged Gargantua,* Rabelais’s greatest pro- 
duction from the standpoint of education, is, therefore, a 
thing of patches. A bit of profound truth, a rare prophecy, 
alternate with chapters of grossest foolery, relics of the old 
extravagance.

there appeared, in 1546, under shelter of royal sanction,} 
the second book of Pantagruel, the third of the series. 
This, intellectually, is his masterpiece; it is satire at the 
highest. The fourth and fifth books, devoted to the voyage 
of Pantagruel in search of the Oracle, while more homo- 
geneous than the earlier ones, are, for our present purpose, 
far inferior, and possess no vital interest. To a study of 
Rabelais as a whole, however, they are the key. 
Here it seems proper to identify and defend my position 
as to the ever-mooted question of Rabelais’s purpose in 
these books.?, Either he was a gross panderer to vulgar,

2 Two quotations will serve to exemplify the antipodal position of 
the critics of Rabelais. Michelet says of him (Hist. de France, VIII. 
428): ‘*What was he? Ask, rather, what he was not. A man 
versed in every study, every art, every tongue, the true Pan-ourgos, 
universal agent in things scientific and political, who was everything 
and was fitted for everything, who contained the genius of the cen- 
tury and lavished it without stint. ... A bold navigator upon the 
deep sea that had engulfed the old gods, he sets out to seek the great 
Perhaps; . . . already America and the new isles, already the chem- 
ical substances extracted from plants, already the motion of the blood, 
the circulation of life, the interdependence of the bodily functions, 
press forward in the Pantagruel in sublime pages which, under a 
light and ironical form, are, none the less, the religious hymns of the 
Renaissance.’’ Contrast with this outburst, the judgment of Sir 
James Stephen (Lectures on the History of France, London, 1857): 
‘¢ A genuine epicurean gifted with gigantic powers, but of cold affec- 
tions and debased appetites; ever worshipping and obeying his one 
idol, Pleasure, though at one time she bids him soar to the empyrean 
and at another commands him to wallow in the sty. ... Deep and 
fatal are the traces of his example and of his fame in the literary 
history of his native land. With him commences the lineage of those 
eminent spirits who have waged war in France against the moral and 
religious convictions and even against the social decencies of the 
Christian world; a war productive of some of the sorest troubles, or 
rather, let us say, of some of the heaviest chastisements, which have 
rebuked the offences of the nations of modern Europe.’ —

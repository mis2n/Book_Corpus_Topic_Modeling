PREFACE 
The writer through some twenty years of close con- 
tact with secondary education as teacher, high school 
principal, and director of training schools, has modified 
materially his own ideas concerning the function of the 
American high school and particularly concerning the 
function of the various high school subjects. The chief 
factor in bringing about this changed attitude has been 
the insight into the fundamental facts of adolescent life 
that has come to the writer from the lives of the many 
adolescent boys and girls with whom he has had the 
pleasure of living on the most friendly terms. Out of 
the many confidences that have come to him as an 
advisor of youth has come fuller appreciation of the 
crucial nature of the adolescent period and deeper 
sympathy for the high school boys and girls in their 
struggle toward maturity. Out of administrative ex- 
periences has come the firm conviction that the high 
schools of this country will in time become really 
Americanized. Believing that democratic citizenship 
can not be developed in secondary schools under the 
Prussian lock-step administration, and believing that 
intellectual life can not be developed under the aca- 
demic traditions that have made “lesson getting” a

fetish, the writer has ventured to present this discus- 
sion of the Principles of Teaching High School Pupils, 
with the hope that the point of view may be helpful 
in stimulating teachers, principals, and educators in 
general to think more intensely about the problems of 
secondary teaching.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Teachers’ Colleges and all institutions offering pro- 
fessional training for teachers of secondary schools are 
finding their courses in principles of secondary educa- 
tion, technique of teaching secondary school subjects, 
high school administration, psychology of high school 
subjects and educational measurement as applied to 
the high school are attracting the serious attention of 
steadily increasing numbers of students. Much of this 
active interest is due to a demand on the part of those 
responsible for the administration of our high schools 
that candidates for teaching positions present evi- 
dence that professional training applying directly to 
secondary school work has been secured. While it is 
still true that an undue proportion of teachers in 
high schools depend upon academic training and ex- 
perience as their assets for professional recognition, 
the army of young people entering high school work 
find their prospects seriously injured if they are not 
well prepared both as to knowledge of their special 
teaching subjects and as to methods and technique of 
the learning and teaching processes. 
The author of this volume as a result of his per- 
sonal contact with large numbers of students preparing 
for high school teaching has become impressed with 
xl
-P-A-G-E-14
  xiv EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
the necessity of emphasizing the learning process. He 
rightly conceives the chief function of the teacher as 
directing the student in his methods of study. A skil- 
ful recitation is one which functions in increased abil- 
ity of the student to proceed with the work in the 
subject. Throughout the volume he keeps this idea 
constantly in mind. 
What are the principles of teaching which make 
most effective the learning process? What is their 
application to the particular problem of the adoles- 
cent? In attempting to answer these questions a com- 
prehensive discussion of secondary education from the 
standpoint of the teacher actually working with the 
pupils is given. The analysis of the problem presented 
will be found helpful to the experienced teacher who 
wishes to check his practices from the standpoint of 
modern technique. As a text-book for classes in gen- 
eral method of high school teaching it is hoped that 
this volume will be found to meet a very real need.

PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
A pedagogical need.—The teaching situation in- 
volves a number of fundamentally important problems. 
There is the problem of method, the problem of devices, 
the problem of technique, the problem of subject- 
matter organization, and so on. The efficiency of the 
teacher depends very largely upon the clearness with 
which he conceives these problems and sets each prob- 
lem off from every other problem involved in the teach- 
ing performance. The teacher must not only see each 
of these problems as a distinct aspect of the teaching 
situation, but he must also see the interrelations exist- 
ing between them as parts of the teaching performance 
as a whole. Once a really clear conception of each of 
these problems is secured, the general vagueness of the 
teacher’s conception of the teaching performance as 
a whole will give way to a clear and well defined unity. 
Then the teacher can turn to any one of these prob- 
lems in the teaching situation and be able to place 
3
-P-A-G-E-18
  4 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
proper emphasis upon it without obscuring the unity 
of the teaching performance. In fact, the more the 
teacher gives attention to each of these problems as 
individual existences, the more clearly the unity of 
the teaching situation will stand out in his thinking. 
The first step in bringing about this clarity of thinking 
on the part of the teacher is that of setting up clear-cut 
definitions of pedagogical terms. That is to say, the 
terms method, device, technique, etc., should be defined 
in the clearest possible language. 
Pedagogical terms should have restricted meanings. 
—tThe primary step in the securing of really clear defi- 
nitions of pedagogical terms is that of restricting the 
meaning of each term. That is to say, each peda- 
gogical term should be narrowed down in its meaning 
until it has a very specific and significant use. The 
term method, for example, should be narrowed down 
to mean merely the psychological procedure of the 
learner as he deals with any kind of subject-matter 
that is presented to his mind. The need of restricting 
the meaning of the term method is readily realized 
when one reads the typical discussions about method. 
Ordinarily the term is used in so broad and general a 
sense that diffuseness and vagueness of thinking at- 
tends the reading of pedagogical literature. This is 
especially true in the case of the novice or inexperi- 
enced student of education. He not infrequently be- 
comes so confused by the array of generalities that he 
is unable to conceive method as a distinct aspect of
-P-A-G-E-19
  INTRODUCTION 5 
teaching clearly set off from every other aspect of the 
teaching situation. 
The use of the term method in the broad general 
sense that is usually employed confuses it with the 
problems of device, technique, motivation, ete. On 
the other hand, the use of the term in the restricted 
sense suggested above sets method off very clearly from 
device, technique, motivation, and the other phases of 
the teaching performance. The terms device, tech- 
nique, motivation, etc., likewise need to be defined with 
carefully restricted meanings in order to render them 
of the greatest practical value to the teacher. The 
more carefully the meanings of these pedagogical terms 
are restricted, the clearer the thinking of the student 
of education will be in regard to the individual aspects 
of the teaching performance and also in regard to the 
teaching situation as a whole. Therefore, notwith- 
standing the fact that some eminent writers of peda- 
gogical literature advocate the use of these terms in 
the broadest possible sense, the writer urges that 
simplicity and narrowness of meanings in the use of 
pedagogical terms is the only way to make them valu- 
able tools of teaching. 
The reason for the title of this volume.—The need 
of restricting the meanings of pedagogical terms is not 
only realized by reading the general diffuse educational 
discussions set down in so many books, but is also very 
vividly realized by giving attention to the titles of 
pedagogical books. One of the common practices in
-P-A-G-E-20
  6 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
educational literature is to use a term that should be 
restricted to a very narrow meaning as the title of a 
discussion that covers a very much broader field than 
even the most general meaning of the term can legiti- 
mately cover. The term methods or methods of 
teaching, for example, is very commonly used as the 
title of a pedagogical discussion that must necessarily 
include vastly more than a consideration of just 
method, if it is to be of great service to teachers in 
mastering the implications of the teaching situation. 
Such a book, while purporting to be a discussion of 
methods, gives relatively little space to the treatment 
of genuine method. It gives a great deal of space to 
the discussion of devices, technique, organization of 
subject-matter, and many other topics, all of which are 
important and all of which should be very thoroughly 
treated in any adequate discussion of the teaching 
situation, and yet none of which are method or methods 
at all. The title of the book is a misnomer and con- 
fuses the inexperienced student of education until he 
is not sure as to what really constitutes method, or 
technique, or motivation, etc. Therefore the possi- 
bility of his articulating the pedagogical materials so 
diffusely ‘presented with the practical teaching situa- 
tions in which they should be effective is out of the 
question. In fact, not only inexperienced teachers and 
students of education are confused by such literature, 
but even experienced teachers and well trained students 
of education undergo no little difficulty in attempting
-P-A-G-E-21
  
INTRODUCTION 7 
to sift out this conglomeration of so-called method 
materials, and to classify them for practical purposes. 
This confusion can be avoided very readily through 
the selection of a term for the title of a discussion that, . 
when defined in a narrow enough sense to render its 
meaning perfectly clear cut and highly significant, is 
still broad enough to include legitimately every topic 
that the author desires to present. Therefore the title 
of this discussion has been selected in keeping with the 
above argument for the restricting of the meanings of 
pedagogical terms, and also with the view of avoiding 
the confusion that arises from the use of a narrow term 
to designate a broader field of considerations than the 
term can legitimately cover. In order to comply with 
these two important points, the term principles, which 
is the key-word of the title, must be taken in the sense 
in which it is defined below. 
The term principles defined—The sense in which 
the term principles is used in the title of this discus- 
sion and all the way through the book is that of the 
literal meaning of the Latin word from which the term 
is derived. The term principles is derived from the 
Latin word princeps, which means a chief or leader. 
This definition of the term principles, when applied in 
the plural to the teaching process, means that the prin- 
ciples of teaching are the chief or leading things that 
must be kept in mind and used as a guide in order to 
carry on the teaching performance in an intelligent and 
effective manner. These principles of teaching, then,  
-P-A-G-E-22
    8 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
are the psychological laws of learning, important edu- 
cational concepts, rules of practice, and so on. In fact, 
whatever is vitally helpful to the teacher in presenting 
any kind of subject-matter to the mind of the pupil 
may be included in the body of teaching principles. 
This definition of the term principles is highly im- 
portant and should be kept clearly in mind throughout 
the entire discussion. This meaning of the term espe- 
cially should be set over against the meaning that is 
so commonly held for the word—namely, that a prin- 
ciple is always a law or arule according to which things 
are to be done. The laws and rules in any field of 
subject-matter may be, and no doubt usually are, im- 
portant considerations in the study of the particular 
body of materials. The purposes for which the subject- 
matter is being employed in the education of the par- 
ticular group of pupils will determine this point. If 
the purposes for which the subject-matter is being 
employed determine that the laws and rules existing 
in the materials are important matters for considera- 
tion, then the laws and rules are principles in that field. 
The term principle, however, is not synonymous with 
the word law or with the word rule. It includes not 
only the laws and rules, when they are considered im- 
portant, but it also includes all other facts and factors 
that are of great importance according to the purposes 
for which the body of subject-matter is employed. 
There are always many other facts and factors than 
laws and rules that should be considered in any
-P-A-G-E-23
INTRODUCTION 9 
thoroughgoing consideration of a given body of mate- 
rials; therefore these other facts and factors are just as 
truly principles as are the laws and rules, and they all 
should be included in the statement of principles. 
The term principles, then, as defined above and 
discussed, is restricted enough in meaning that it has 
a very definite and significant denotation, and at the 
same time it is broad enough in meaning to include 
legitimately every important aspect of the teaching 
situation that the high school teacher should master in 
order to become efficient in educating adolescent pupils. 
A further reason for the title——The latter part of 
the title, “Teaching High School Pupils by Means of 
the High School Subjects,” is used in order to help the 
teacher to get away from the time-honored idea in his 
thinking of the job of teaching as being the teaching 
of a subject. The successful high school teacher of 
to-day must think of the job of teaching in terms of 
what adolescent boys and girls are and what they may 
and ought to become by means of their study of the 
different fields of subject-matter that the high school 
subjects present. This idea will be discussed in more 
detail later on, but it needs to be emphasized from the 
very outset. The very title, “The Principles of Teach- 
ing High School Pupils,” makes the pupils themselves 
the point of departure in determining what the leading 
things or principles are that should be mastered and 
used as a guide in all high school teaching. Moreover, 
it makes the pupils the center of emphasis in deter-  
-P-A-G-E-24
  10 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
mining the value and function of each principle that 
is considered. 
Where the emphasis in teaching should be.—The 
emphasis in all teaching should be upon the learning 
process and not upon the subject. It is the function 
of the teacher to stimulate the mind of the learner to 
react effectively to subject-matter. When the learner 
fails in his efforts to master the subject-matter or fails 
to form the habits desired, it is the business of the 
teacher to determine the exact point or points at which 
the mental processes of the learner were in error, and 
to bring about correct mental procedure. In other 
words, then, it is what goes on in the mind of the pupil 
that educates him. Therefore, when we talk about 
educating the pupil by means of the subject, we are 
talking about what goes on in the mind of the learner 
and how it goes on as a result of dealing with the 
subject-matter. This idea must be kept uppermost all 
the time. Every teacher should come to realize that 
the important point in the recitation of a particular 
pupil is not the fact that he made an error, but that 
it is why he made that mistake. If the teacher can 
discover why the pupil made the error, then he can 
turn with some assurance to directing the mental 
processes of the learner in building up the right men- 
tal habits so that the error will not be apt to occur 
again. This idea of what goes on in the mind of the 
learner must be made the starting-point of every 
teaching principle. It is the one most fundamental
-P-A-G-E-25
  
INTRODUCTION il 
consideration of all the teaching principles. The other 
important principles concerning the teaching situa- 
tion are significant only as they throw light upon 
and aid the teacher in directing the learning perfor- 
mance. 
For example, an understanding of the psychological, 
physiological, and social characteristics and tendencies 
of adolescent boys and girls will be helpful in teaching 
just to the extent that such an understanding helps the 
teacher to know what goes on or may be expected 
naturally to go on in the mind of the learner under 
different psychic, physical, and social conditions. 
Again, all application of rules of conduct must be 
guided by the effect they will have upon the mental 
procedure of the learner in attempting to make proper 
adjustments of his relations to other individuals and 
to the school as an institution. The organization of 
subject-matter must be guided by the relation that 
subject-matter bears to effective learning. The selec- 
tion of devices and the working out of an effective body 
of technique must be in keeping with this idea of how 
they will affect the procedure of the learner. In fine, 
then, the mental procedure of the learner may be called 
the core of the teaching situation, and all other prin- 
ciples or considerations must be organized around this 
core or center. 
Principles enumerated.—The most important prin- 
ciples that should be considered by the teacher of high 
school pupils are as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
12 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
1. The modern conception of the secondary school. This 
conception involves a clear understanding of: 
a. The meaning of adolescence. 
b. The function of the secondary school as an in- 
stitution. 
c. The function of the high school subjects. 
2. The psychological processes involved in learning, or 
method. These processes include: 
a. The general movement of the mind in learning 
any kind of subject-matter. 
b. The specific mental processes that go on within 
the general mental movement as it is em- 
ployed in the learning of a particular body 
of subject-matter. 
3. The motivation of learning. This involves: 
a. Interest. 
b. Dominant psychological tendencies of adoles- 
cence. 
c. Physiological characteristics and limitations. 
d. Sociological traits and tendencies. 
e. Possible results in education or development 
from the study of the subject. These results 
include the immediate results upon the ability 
of the learner, and the future opportunities 
opened up to the learner in the same or in 
other fields. 
4. Individual differences in: 
. Previous training. 
Rate of speed in learning. 
. Mental maturity. 
. Sex traits. 
. Types of mind. 
Types of imagery. 
5. The organization of subject-matter from the stand- 
point of: 
a. The central idea that has brought the body of 
subject-matter into existence. 
b. Presenting the subject-matter to pupils of high 
school age. This involves the choice between 
inductive and deductive types of organiza- So ao oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
INTRODUCTION 13 
tion, and the proper balancing of content and 
formal material. 
c. The relation of the subject to other subjects and 
affairs of life. 
d. The psychological gradation and arrangement 
of material according to the mental maturity 
of the particular group of pupils. This in- 
volves the choice between (1) problem and 
(2) project. 
e. The units or wholes that may be taken for the 
most effective mastering and memorizing of 
the facts according to the maturity of the 
learner. 
6. Devices from the standpoint of: 
a. Classification for practical purposes. 
b. The criteria that should guide in their selection 
and use. 
7. Measurement of the results of teaching. This involves: 
a. Evaluation of reactions during teaching periods. 
b. Employment of quizzes and examinations. 
c. Use of standard tests. 
8. Technique of teaching from the standpoint of: 
a. Criteria that should determine the selection and 
use of the particular acts practised. 
b. A body of technique that is in general good. 
c. A body of technique that is in general bad. 
9. The supervision of the study habits of high school 
pupils. 
10. The problems of conduct or development and control 
of behavior of high school pupils. 
EMPHASIS IN TEACHER TRAINING 
Emphasis upon human materials.—One of the most 
important aspects of teacher training that should re- 
ceive emphasis is that of attention to the human 
materials with which the teacher must deal. Teachers 
and educators in general have given so much attention
-P-A-G-E-28
    14 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
to the acquisition of subject-matter that they tend to 
think more about the subjects than they do of the 
pupils. The study of the psychology of adolescence 
has usually been so much academic study of facts that 
are scientifically interesting, and which may throw 
some light upon how to help the pupils learn by means 
of the high school subjects. Too much attention has 
been given to what belongs in the development of the 
subjects and far too little attention has been given to 
what belongs in the psychic evolution of human beings. 
Because of this false emphasis, many people hold the 
idea that one who knows the facts of a subject thor- 
oughly knows how to use that subject as a means of 
educating the pupil. Rather one should say they hold 
that such an individual is qualified to “teach the 
subject,” for they are not. truly thinking about real, 
genuine education of the pupil. Then, too, if these 
people do undertake the study of the problems of 
teaching in any serious fashion, they study everything 
that seems to be involved in the light of how it is 
related to the subject. When they think and talk 
about methods they have their attention centered upon 
the subject and how they will deal with this and that 
body of facts. The thing that is farthest from their 
minds is the human element, the learner. 
The result of the above condition is that many people 
go out to teach history, English, etc., instead of going 
out to teach adolescent boys and girls by means of 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  INTRODUCTION 15 
history, English, etc. These people have paid the price 
in order to know the fields of facts called history, 
English, etc., but seldom do you find an individual who 
has paid more than a small fraction of the price neces- 
sary to know adolescents. The training institutions 
are in a large measure to blame. They have con- 
sistently required the prospective teacher to take thirty 
hours in a major subject and twenty hours in a minor 
subject, and then they require a minimum of fifteen 
hours, possibly a little more, in the study of the pro- 
fessional side of teaching. This is too meager an 
amount of time for a mastery of even the essential 
knowledge of psychological processes, devices, and 
technique of teaching, to say nothing about the 
mastery of the psychology of the human materials that 
are the vital core of education. 
The subject-matter set down in subjects is more or 
less permanent and fixed. The facts and truths of 
science and literature, etc., do not change. The adoles- 
cent youth, however, is a dynamic thing that is con- 
tinually exhibiting new phases and aspects of develop- 
ment. If it requires thirty hours of diligent study to 
know enough of the dead facts of history to talk intel- 
ligently about history as a science or about history as 
related to civic and political problems, then surely it 
must require at least thirty hours of intensive study of 
the psychological factors and elements incident to 
adolescent development in order for one to deal intel- 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  16 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
ligently with such complex and fluctuating human 
factors and elements as they grow and evolve by means 
of the process of education. 
The trouble is that people, for the most part, study 
about enough of the facts of adolescent psychology set 
down in books to get a smattering of the academic 
statements about adolescent beings. They know little 
or nothing of these psychological elements as actual 
existences exhibited in the flesh on every hand. Such 
a study of adolescent psychology renders people about 
as scientific and competent to teach adolescent boys 
and girls as the study of book statements about the 
facts of chemistry would render people who industri- 
ously pore over them scientific and competent chemists 
who could be trusted to go into the laboratories of 
industrial plants and concoct the formuli and mix the 
chemicals for great industrial undertakings. Would 
such academic chemists be given opportunity to try 
out their knowledge at the risk of wrecking and de- 
stroying property and lives? The answer is obvious. 
Why, then, should these would-be adolescent psycholo- 
gists be permitted to try out their academic knowledge 
of the facts of psychology at the risk of wrecking these 
living, growing human souls that must be understood 
and dealt with in such a way as to save them from 
themselves and for the betterment of future genera- 
tions? 
The prospective commercial chemist is required to 
spend a considerable period of time experimenting in
-P-A-G-E-31
  
INTRODUCTION 17 
the laboratory under such supervision and direction as 
to safeguard the life of the experimenter and the 
property. When he has mastered the science of pre- 
determining and controlling chemical reactions, he may 
then be intrusted with the job of harnessing the laws 
of chemical science to some line of commercial activity. 
So too, then, should the prospective teacher of adoles- 
cents be required to spend an ample amount of time 
in an adolescent psychological laboratory, that is, a 
typical secondary school, learning under adequate 
supervision and direction the actions and reactions of 
the complex psychic elements and factors that go on 
in the development of every adolescent youth. 
Again, let us compare the would-be adolescent psy- 
chologist with the prospective surgeon or physician. 
Does anyone to-day believe that any individual can 
master the science of surgery or of medicine through 
a mere study of book statements of facts about surgery 
and medicine? Who would be willing to trust his life 
under the knife of a surgeon who had never dissected 
human forms in order to learn the exact location and 
arrangement of each minute part of the human or- 
ganism upon which he would operate? The answer 
is perfectly obvious. But is not such a would-be sur- 
geon just as well prepared to operate upon the body 
of a human being as the would-be adolescent psy- 
chologist, described above, is prepared to operate upon 
the mind and soul of a human being who is undergoing 
the secondary period of existence? The answer is just 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
18 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
as obvious in the one case as it is in the other. And 
the danger both to the individual victims and to society 
as a whole is just as great in one case as it is in the 
other. 
What, then, about the would-be physician? Who 
would trust him to prescribe medicine, in a case of 
illness, if his knowledge has been gained merely 
through book study? The medical man who would 
secure the confidence of the public to-day must serve 
as an interne in some recognized hospital, where he 
can see the effects of medicine administered by expert 
physicians under conditions of serious illness. And yet, 
the book-trained doctor of medicine is no more apt to 
do serious harm to his patients than is the book-trained 
adolescent psychologist apt to do harm to his victims. 
Both are lacking in the most vital and most essential 
training that would really fit them for their respective 
professions. 
Principles of teaching must be put into practice.— 
The need to-day is for more and more practical study 
of the actual teaching situations. This does not mean 
that less time should be spent in the educational 
laboratory studying the facts of adolescent psychology 
in actual existence, and it does not mean that less time 
should be given to the study of theory; for, as it is, 
the number of hours required is too small to enable 
the student to master thoroughly the fundamental con- 
cepts of education and to become acquainted with the 
best literature in the educational field. But an ample   
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
INTRODUCTION 19 
knowledge of theory and application of theory must 
be brought together and kept together through a suffi- 
cient length of time, so that both may be mastered and 
become automatic in the thinking and doing of the 
teacher. 
The same idea holds that was set forth in discussing 
the mastery of the human materials of secondary edu- 
cation; namely, that the tools of teaching can not be 
mastered through mere academic study of book state- 
ments about such tools. More and more time must be 
spent in working out the application to actual teaching 
situations. In other words, prospective teachers should 
spend, in addition to their academic and laboratory 
study of education courses, something like twenty or 
thirty hours in the educational laboratory, studying 
and applying the principles of teaching. 
SUMMARY 
Clear definition of pedagogical terms is needed to 
clarify thinking about the educative process. The 
primary step in the securing of clear pedagogical defi- 
nitions is that of restricting the use of pedagogical 
terms to very narrow and significant meanings. The 
title of a pedagogical discussion should be broad enough 
to cover legitimately every phase of discussion that 
is desirable to present, and at the same time it should 
be narrow enough to be definite. The title “Principles 
of Teaching High School Pupils” is in keeping with this 
point of view, and it also serves to place the emphasis 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    20 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
in all teaching upon the learner instead of upon the 
subject. The emphasis in all teaching should be upon 
the psychological processes of the learner. The large 
principles involved in teaching high school pupils are: 
modern conception of the secondary school, psychology 
of learning, motivation, individual differences, organ- 
ization of subject-matter, devices, technique, measure- 
ment of results of teaching, supervised study, and con- 
trol of behavior of pupils. The greatest emphasis in 
teacher training should be upon the human materials 
with which the teacher deals in teaching; but emphasis 
must also be given to the teaching tools. The prin- 
ciples of teaching must be ultimately mastered through 
putting them into practice, hence practice teaching 
needs more emphasis than it now receives.

THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE 
HIGH SCHOOL 
The modern conception of the high school.—One 
of the very first principles that the high school teacher. 
should acquire is a clear understanding of the modern 
conception of the high school. This conception in- 
volves an understanding of the meaning and signifi- 
cance of adolescence, a realization of the function of. 
the high school as an institution, and a full recognition 
of the function of the various high school subjects. It 
is only by a thorough mastery of this conception and a 
faithful adherence to it in his actual teaching that 
the high school teacher will be able to break away 
from the trammeling bonds of academic and scholastic 
traditions that have been the chief factors in un- 
Americanizing the public high schools of our country. 
The teacher who does not acquire the point of view 
of modern educational leaders will not have a proper 
conception of the true function and mission of the 
secondary teacher; hence that teacher can not do con- 
structive building in the great laboratory of adolescent 
life. 
The.meaning of adolescence.—The evolution of the 
E 22
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 23 
life of a human being exhibits four periods or stages 
of development; namely, childhood, adolescence, adult- 
hood, and senescence or old age. The period of child- 
hood extends from birth to about age eleven or twelve. 
It is the period in which the organism is laying the 
basis for all future development, and this is especially 
true of the physical aspect of growth of the nervous 
system. The brain mass of the human being is prac- 
tically full grown at the age of nine or ten, and is 
ready for intensive inner growth or functional develop- 
ment. Just about the time the brain of the child is 
reaching the completion of its physical growth, the 
organs of reproduction begin to develop with new 
physical significance. The awakening of these vital 
physical functions within the body and the swing from 
the physical growth of the brain tissues to their mental 
functioning marks the inception of adolescence or the 
secondary period of human existence. This secondary 
period of growth ends with the maturity of the repro- 
ductive organs and the stabilizing of the mental organ- 
izations of the central nervous system. This stage of 
development is reached at about the age of twenty or 
twenty-one. The individual at this age enters upon 
the period of adulthood and becomes fully responsible 
for his own existence and for contributing to the wel- 
fare of society as a whole. This is the period of maxi- 
mum physical and mental possibilities. Finally, at 
about sixty to seventy years of age senescence or old 
age sets in and the entire being begins to decline in
-P-A-G-E-38
  24 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
vigor. All growth ceases and the stored-up mental and 
physical reservoirs are gradually drained of their 
treasures. 
The setting up of adolescence in its relation to the 
other stages of human development, and the marking 
off definitely of its biological limitations, suggests at 
once the most significant aspect of its true meaning. 
That is to say, the period of adolescence or secondary 
existence is a time of great mental and physical change 
and readjustment. Therefore the high school, or more 
correctly the secondary school, presents a most dynamic 
situation that is teeming with manifold possibilities. 
In fact, the change that comes to the human being 
during the secondary period of his development is so 
very great, both physically and mentally, that it may 
well be called a period of rebirth. That is to say, out 
of the travail of adolescent stress and struggle is born 
the man or woman with adult powers and with a 
mature outlook upon life, and with the dependable 
attitudes of mind that bring stability of thinking and 
of behavior. Therefore the adolescent or secondary 
period of existence is perhaps the most critical of all 
the stages of human development. The validity of this 
point of view will be made clear by noting somewhat 
briefly the most vital changes that take place during 
this period. | 
Physical characteristics of adolescence.—The most 
significant physical characteristic of the secondary 
period of growth is the fact that the higher brain 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 25 
centers function at a relatively rapid rate. The cere- 
brum of the adolescent is a great tract of myriads of 
nerve-cells and myriads of nerve-fibers that as yet have 
not been linked together into very many definite 
groups thoroughly coérdinated for the carrying on of 
specific mental operations. Just what the internal 
organization of this undifferentiated neural mass will 
be depends upon the experiences and training that 
come to the mind that is groping to be born into adult- 
hood. The critical need at this stage is to establish 
dependable points of mental anchorage to which the 
manifold experiences and activities of youthful life may 
be moored with ever strengthening cables of judgment 
and reasoning. The great problem of the secondary 
teacher is that of determining just what these points 
of mental anchorage may and should be for each indi- 
vidual, and of selecting the types of judicial and reflec- 
tive mental cables that will most safely bind the ex- 
periences and activities of each individual into co- 
herent, codrdinated mental and moral unities. More 
than that, the teacher of adolescents must be a factor 
in determining what experiences will come to the pupils 
under his charge, and especially what types of mental 
activity will be made most prominent under his 
direction. 
A second physical characteristic that is important is 
that of the fluctuation of energy. The adolescent in- 
dividual is at times filled with an excess of energy that 
drives him with impelling force into the exhibition of 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
    26 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
excessive physical activities. At other times this same 
individual possesses very little energy, and as a result — 
he is extremely sluggish and averse to putting forth — 
any sort of physical effort. This flow and ebb of 
energy is largely due to the physiological changes that 
take place during adolescence. The most important — 
of these changes are the unusual lengthening of the 
bones of the body, the enormous increase in the size 
of the heart and in the blood pressure, and the pro- 
found organic changes that mark the maturing of the 
organs of reproduction. 
This fluctuation of energy, however, is also influ- 
enced by environment and especially by conditions of — 
weather. That is to say, the tide of energy in the 
adolescent being is subject to kinesthetic and organic 
stimuli from within and to sensory stimulations from 
without. Thus it comes about that the adolescent 
youngster is one day a restless whirlwind of energy and 
activity and the next day a lazy zephyr or a dead calm. 
This exhibition of so marked a change of physical front 
is not necessarily a diurnal rhythm. It may come 
within an hour or even a few minutes during the school- 
day. Hence one must constantly be prepared to stay 
and utilize the wild surges of the gale of energy or to 
stir the feeble breeze of lassitude into action. Again, 
this swing from high to low pressure may come at 
longer periods and each curve of the rhythm may ex- 
tend over some little time. That is to say, the youth 
may exhibit energy and work vigorously for a week, 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 27 
two weeks, or even longer, and then slump into a cor- 
responding period, longer or shorter, in which he does 
very little. The critical point in this connection is 
that these changes in the amount of energy exhibited 
in so many variations are indications of certain bio- 
logical necessities of the individual. Therefore the 
problem in secondary education that is presented by 
this physical fact is that of capitalizing this excess 
energy at its flow and of not making undue demands 
upon the individual when his energy is at low ebb. 
One must become an expert diagnostician if he would 
deal with this problem most successfully. 
Another physical characteristic that should be con- 
sidered is that of the alternate periods of rapid and slow 
growth of the body. This change is especially marked 
by the change in height of the individual. The peda- 
gogical problem that is presented by this situation is 
that of adjusting the demands made upon the pupil 
for mental development during these two aspects of 
physical growth. The mind of the learner develops 
slowly during the time that his body is rapidly in- 
creasing its stature; and it tends to develop at a rela- 
tively rapid rate of speed when his body is making 
little increase in its growth. This problem of adjust- 
ment is vitally related to the problem of adjusting to 
the flow and ebb of physical energy that has just been 
set forth. The rhythms of growth of the body, how- 
ever, are much more regular than are the fluctuations 
of the curve of vital energy that the individual 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    28 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
possesses. Therefore the adjustment in educational 
demands made upon the adolescent should be made 
first to meet his growth rhythms, and second to meet 
the energy rhythms displayed within the periods of the 
growth rhythms. In this way both types of biological 
necessity will be met most effectively and to the best 
physical and mental interests of the individual. 
Another physical fact of adolescence is that virtually 
all of the codrdinations that the individual will ever 
possess are brought to completion during this period. 
The control that the youth acquires over these co- 
ordinations is for the most part extremely awkward, 
ungainly, and bungling as far as his large, general 
codrdinations are concerned, while at the same time 
great facility is displayed for forming certain specific 
finer codrdinations. These facts relate themselves to 
two educational problems. The first problem is that 
of determining economically and effectively the kinds 
of motor skills that may be taken on during this period 
of development. The other problem is that of making 
accurate interpretations of the physical acts and efforts 
of the adolescent pupil. The first of these two prob- 
lems should be settled and provided for in making the 
curriculum of the secondary school. The second prob- 
lem is one that must be dealt with continually in the 
general life of the school. This problem is met with 
in the class-room, in the periods of intermission, in the 
social activities, in the athletics—in fact, in every phase 
of the school’s operation. The critical point is to know
-P-A-G-E-43
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 29 
when the physical performance of the youth is abso- 
lutely sincere and faithfully done, and when it is pur- 
posefully bungled or made ineffective; and to judge 
when to take the matter firmly in hand, and when to 
utterly ignore the case. Much experience in meeting 
the various types of physical exhibitions and many 
painstaking analyses of individual cases form the only 
way in which the secondary teacher can become pro- 
ficient in meeting the crises that many times arise in 
connection with this problem. The whole situation 
may be made clearer by giving some illustrations of 
the above points. 
For example, during the early years of adolescence 
boys and girls can hardly be trusted to handle break- 
able materials without coming to grief. They blunder 
into things, knocking them over and breaking them. 
They drop things that are given to them to hold, and 
in attempting to pick up one thing they frequently 
knock two or three other things over. They meet with 
serious accidents to their clothing on account of their 
ungainly and awkward movements. When it comes 
to the things that the youth does through the general 
management of his physical being, much grief comes 
from the extreme awkardness with which these general 
movements are performed. The critical point is that 
the harder the awkward boy or girl tries to prevent 
the blunder the surer he or she is to make it. This 
fact explains the reluctance with which some timid 
pupils undertake the doing of anything in the way of 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  30 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
individual demonstrations before the class. The danger 
of failure and the fear of being misunderstood and of 
being criticized is felt very keenly by such pupils. On 
the other hand, some pupils, while very awkward, are 
not sensitive about it, and therefore they make their 
physical blunders appear to be the result of carelessness 
and indifference. When the teacher takes one of these 
pupils to task for his poor performance and insists 
upon a better exhibition of skill, the pupil may main- 
tain that he is doing his best, and when pressed to do 
better he is not unlikely to refuse to do the thing at all. 
The fact that is difficult for the teacher to under- 
stand is that the individual who is very dexterous in 
doing one kind of act that involves relatively fine 
codrdinations is at the same time as awkward as an 
ox in the general management of his physical move- 
ments. But this is a fundamental truth of adolescence. 
The writer has seen a boy who was so awkward that 
he could hardly be trusted to handle a violin for fear 
he would drop it or strike it against something and 
break it, learn to finger the keyboard -so that he could 
strike the strings very accurately and to make the 
strokes with the bow in a highly skilful manner. 
Another example is that of the boy who is so awkward 
that he falls over his own feet and yet learns to ride 
the bicycle readily, and even rides without the use of 
the handle-bars. The girl who can hardly be trusted 
to set the dining-table for fear she will break treasured

  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 31 
pieces of chinaware may play the piano or ply a needle 
skilfully. 
The facility with which adolescent pupils of fourteen 
and fifteen years of age take up drawing, penmanship, 
and other forms of handwork, although their general 
movements continue for a considerable length of time 
to be exceedingly ungainly and uncertain, is one of the 
peculiar characteristics of the secondary period of 
growth. The explanation of this fact seems to lie in 
the first physiological fact that the internal organiza- 
tion of the higher brain-centers is just beginning at 
the inception of adolescence, and that the ultimate 
control of the whole body that gives the individual 
poise and ease of physical movements can be secured 
only through the establishing of many smaller and 
finer sets of codrdinations first, and then through the 
linking up of these well developed sets of organizations 
into the largest organization of codrdination that 
is required for skill in the larger movements of the 
being. 
The body, in other words, is like a great complicated 
machine that has just been assembled and that is being 
readjusted through changing the size of some of its 
parts. The machine as a whole runs with friction. It 
knocks here and clatters there. It binds in one place 
and is too loosely joined up in another part. Gradu- 
ally, however, this part may be adjusted and that part 
may be adjusted until each separate piece of mech-
-P-A-G-E-46
32 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
anism is perfectly lined up to do its particular part of 
the entire movement of the machine, and then, through 
the linking up and lining up of these well adjusted 
parts into the large organization of the machine, the 
lost motion, the friction, the knocks, the rattles, and 
all other awkward movements of the machine dis- 
appear. The machine functions smoothly at last, and 
its work as a whole is done as perfectly as was the 
performance of any part of the mechanism when taken 
by itself. Just so it is with the mechanism of the 
human body during the period of adolescence, so that 
one may truly say, from the standpoint of the physical 
significance of this period, that it is indeed a period of 
stress, struggle, and readjustment toward the final pro- 
duction of a thoroughly developed and highly codrdi- 
nated adult physical being whose powers are no longer 
uncertain. 
Psychological characteristics of adolescence.—The 
first outstanding psychological fact or psychological 
characteristic of adolescence is that the mental, emo- 
tional, moral, and motor habit formations take place 
at a relatively rapid rate, and these habit formations 
tend to be fairly permanent when once formed. This 
fact means that this is the time when the guiding 
ideals, the sanifying emotional backgrounds, the de- 
pendable moral practices, and the fundamental motor 
skills must be set up and crystallized if the boy or the 
girl is to emerge from this secondary period of develop- 
ment into adulthood of the kind that contributes to 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 33 
the progress of civilization. This is the period of 
greatest possibility in the humanizing of the individual. 
It is the period during which the struggle between the 
brutish and animalistic tendencies of human beings 
against the spiritual and Godlike tendencies of man- 
kind rages the most fiercely and most decisively. Out 
of this secondary period come beings who are either 
more Godlike or more animalistic than they were in 
the stage of their infancy and childhood. In other 
words, this period marks the struggle of the soul of 
man to be reborn or freed from the trammel of mere 
animal existence. The ego—the responsible individual 
who seeks a new type of recognition and new avenues 
of existence other than mere animal appetites and 
activities—must now be born, or perhaps lie dormant 
forever. 
A second dominant psychological characteristic is 
the manifestation and relatively rapid development of 
many instincts that take on new significance for the 
individual during this period. The most important 
point to keep in mind in studying these instincts, or 
rather the manifestations of their existence, is that 
the reactions of an individual to the instinctive im- 
pulses may be either positive or negative. Therefore, 
while the instincts are enumerated by designation of 
positive forms of reaction, the reader must think the 
negative forms of reaction as if they were enumerated 
also in a parallel opposite column. The most impor- 
tant instincts that take on vital new significance with
-P-A-G-E-48
  
  34 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
impelling power and controlling influence during 
adolescence are as follows: 
. Self-assertion and individuality. 
. Social recognition and prestige. 
Attraction toward the opposite sex. 
Rivalry and emulation. 
Spirit of romance and love of adventure. 
Pugnacity and love of combat. 
Acquisition of material possessions. 
Leadership and followship. 
. Display and desire to attract attention. 
. Tease and desire to be teased. 
. Play of the competitive motor, intellectual, emotional, 
and volitional types. FSSmNO TRON ee 
The struggle between the positive and negative forms 
of reaction to these instinctive impulses is one of the 
distinctive marks of adolescence, and typifies the period 
as one of extreme effort to make readjustments that 
shall further the whole round of existence of the human 
being. 
Another psychological characteristic of this period 
of development is that of the general uncertainty of 
intellectual, emotional, and moral behavior. This un- 
certainty of behavior is manifested in a variety of ways. 
The youth is doubtful in his choice of school subjects 
and in his selection of a future vocation. He has a 
tendency to follow the lines of least resistance or what 
seem to be the lines of least resistance. That is to say, 
he desires to arrive quickly; hence he takes what 
promises to be the shortest road. He is rash in decid- 
ing important matters upon very meager and insufii- 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 35 
cient information, which means that he may make a 
decision and then reverse his point of view almost 
immediately. Youth is in general fickle of purpose 
and vacillating in making voluntary decisions when 
he faces difficulties. Notwithstanding this fact, he at 
times is very stubborn and tenacious of purpose, while 
at other times he is meek and self-effacing. When 
critical situations arise, the adolescent may be either 
hysterical and go all to pieces, or he may be exceedingly 
cool, indifferent, and self-contained. That is to say, 
he may be perfectly helpless in the face of the situation, 
or he may be a perfect daredevil who faces the crisis 
without the least trepidation. 
Another trait of the adolescent is that of the sudden- 
ness and unreasonableness with which he gives way to 
emotional explosions of anger, hate, love, jealousy, and 
so on. At one time he is bold, and bluffs by taking 
long chances on getting caught up; and then again he 
shrinks away, prevaricates, conceals, whines, and tries 
to beg, flatter, or blarney his way through. Youth is 
always susceptible to suggestion to a very high degree, 
and possesses a vivid power of imagination that often 
leads him to make erratic interpretations of the con- 
duct and motives of others. He is always taking some 
trivial act as being an indication that the teacher “has 
it in for me” or that some schoolmate is “mad at me.” 
All in all, one never knows just what the adolescent is 
going to do, when he will do it, or how he will do it. 
Another trait of the secondary stage of development
-P-A-G-E-50
  e 
36 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
is that of general alertness of mind and interest in the 
dominant qualities of things. That is to say, this is a 
period of intensive experience-getting; hence, mentally 
speaking, the youth pokes his nose into everything that 
goes on around him, or at least he has a general ten- 
dency to see and hear everything that takes place 
around him. He is busy rediscovering the world for 
himself. Along with this general mental alertness goes 
a philosophical turn and tendency of mind that ques- 
tions the validity of virtually every phase of fact and 
truth. The adolescent remakes the laws of the uni- 
verse. He either believes most absolutely and un- 
waveringly, or he scoffs at and disbelieves just as stead- 
fastly the most profound truths of all time. One of his 
strongest tendencies in this connection is to be religious. 
That is to say, he instinctively and intuitively responds 
to the evidences of a power beyond the ken of man, and 
seeks relationship with this power as the only safe- 
guard against the influences over which he realizes that 
his fellow men have no control. The mystery of his 
own evolution is undoubtedly one of the strongest 
factors in giving him this religious tendency. 
A final psychological characteristic of this period is 
that of the fluctuation of dominant interest between 
the mastery of theories, principles, and abstract truths, 
and the actual application of these theories, principles, 
and truths to the doing of things and to the acquiring 
of first-hand experiences in meeting actual situations 
of life. This fact presents one of the most critical
-P-A-G-E-51
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 37 
problems of all in the determining of the curricula and 
in the administration of the curricula of the secondary 
school. The adolescent pupil gets as tired of doing 
things as he does of learning theories, facts, etc., if he 
is kept at it too long. The problem is how to so dis- 
tribute the two types of opportunity that consistent 
growth with a maximum of interest will be secured. 
This problem is not only an acute one in the making 
of the curricula as a whole, but it is also critical in the 
arrangement of subject-matter within any given course. 
A careful consideration of the above psychological 
characteristics of adolescence will lead one to the con- 
clusion that the secondary period of human develop- 
ment is indeed a stage of extreme struggle, stress, and 
manifold changing, as far as the mental and moral life 
of the human being is concerned. Therefore one may 
say with assurance that this period is the most critical 
of all, in that it is the period that very largely deter- 
mines what the mental and moral backgrounds are that 
should be developed and crystallized during this white 
heat of life, when all the humanizing elements are 
liquid in the crucible. 
THE FUNCTION OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
The point of view.—The first and fundamental idea 
that the writer holds is that the life of the adolescent 
or secondary individual is a stream into which many 
tributaries are pouring their various kinds and degrees
-P-A-G-E-52
      
38 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of influence and training. ) That is to say, the adoles- 
cent is not just preparing to live, but he is living his 
secondary life now, and this ongoing stream of life is 
full of significance for him in the now. He has a 
point of view and outlook upon the problems of 
existence that to him is all-important and conclusive. 
The second idea in the whole point of view is that 
while the adolescent is living through his secondary 
period of existence he is also laying the basis and pre- 
paring himself for his adult life that is to follow. The 
vital point to note, however, is that he prepares him- 
self most thoroughly for his adulthood by living out 
his adolescent life most fully and completely. There- 
fore, when he meets the experiences and performs the 
activities that most fully satisfy the physical and 
psychic elements and evolutions that are resident 
within his being during this period of stress and 
struggle, he comes to adulthood with the best inherit- 
ance and the best possible training for meeting the 
new.responsibilities that then come to him as a legally 
responsible individual. 
A third idea in the point of view is that the secon- 
dary or high school is only one of the agencies that are 
employed in assisting the adolescent individual to live 
out his secondary period of existence. Therefore the 
secondary school must determine, first of all, just what 
phases of adolescent life it can contribute to more 
vitally and economically than can any of the other 
agencies that are making simultaneous contributions
-P-A-G-E-53
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 39 
to the same period of development. That is to say, 
the secondary school must actually come to exist for 
the sake of its constituency, and it must put service to 
human beings as individuals and as groups above 
everything else. The school must be willing to be a 
device, just a means, merely an incident, in the total 
life of the boy or girl who comes into the school to take 
advantage of educational opportunities that are not 
available elsewhere. If the school is willing to lose its 
life for the sake of the pupils, it will find a more abun- 
dant life in the actual enrichment of the human ele- 
ments that are developed and crystallized in the heart 
and mind of the pupil who comes under its benign in- 
fluence. Taking the point of view that the primary 
function of the secondary school is that of maturing 
and developing the adolescent boy and girl until they 
have passed through the unstable period of secondary 
existence, it is of the utmost importance to determine 
just what the lines of possible maturity may be. 
Phases of adolescent maturing.—The first phase of 
maturity that should receive definite attention and 
adequate provision is that of physical growth. The 
adolescent individual is passing through a very critical 
period of physical development, and he should have the 
kinds of physical exercise and motor training that will 
best insure a well developed body in stature and 
weight, and that will give muscular strength and thor- 
oughly established codrdinations that are under con- 
trol. In other words, the organic and muscular habits
-P-A-G-E-54
  40 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of the individual should be attuned to good health and 
the accomplishment of some form of physical prowess 
and manual dexterity. The secondary school should 
make provision for contributing systematically to the 
physical well-being of its constituency. No other 
agency has the same favorable opportunity for doing 
this service that the secondary school has. What is 
needed, however, is not rigid requirements of every in- 
dividual, but exercises adapted to the needs of each in- 
dividual. The primary function of the school in this 
regard is to serve and save the individual. 
The second phase of maturing is that of the mental 
maturing of adolescent boys and girls. (The mental 
maturing of the pupil is manifested in two ways. The 
first form is that which is exhibited in the ability to 
deal with more and more complex units of thought in 
interpreting the language of others,\and in the ability 
to employ more and more extended and complex units 
of thought in expressing his own ideas. , That is to say, 
the maturity of the mind is shown by the length and 
complexity of the unit of concept in thinking. The 
unit of concept in thinking has three parallel forms of 
existence; namely, the sentence, the paragraph, and 
the theme or selection. As the mind of the individual 
grows and matures, it becomes able to interpret accu- 
rately and readily more and more complex forms of 
sentences, more and more extended and difficult para- 
graphs, and more and more extended and complicated 
themes or selections. Likewise, the individual builds
-P-A-G-E-55
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 41 
up more and more extended and complicated forms of 
expression in developing his own ideas. This phase 
of mental maturing is developed through definite 
language study, and through enriched acquaintance 
with vital facts and experiences. The problem in 
this regard is for the school to select those fields of 
vital facts and experiences that no other agency is 
able to bring to the adolescent individual in any thor- 
oughgoing and systematic fashion. These bodies of 
facts and experiences should be selected first from the 
standpoint of their fitness for enabling the adolescents 
to live out their secondary lives most fully and com- 
pletely, and second from the standpoint of their fitness 
to enable the adult or post-adolescent to enter some 
professional or technical school to advantage, or to 
enter into some industrial pursuit that does not require 
extended special training. 
The second form in which the mental maturity of 
the individual is exhibited is that of his social reactions. 
As the adolescent pupil becomes more and more ma- 
ture, he manifests an ability to make more and more 
appropriate adjustments of his attitude and behavior 
toward other individuals and toward the various groups 
of individuals with whom he comes in contact both in 
and out of school. The social maturity of the indi- 
vidual is shown through ability to comprehend the 
fundamental social relationships growing out of group 
life, and both to realize his own obligations and to 
make proper adjustments that enable him to carry out  
-P-A-G-E-56
  42 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS J 
his responsibilities in a satisfactory manner. The funec- 
tion of the secondary school in this regard is to help 
the adolescent boy and girl to realize the fundamental 
social relationships that are involved in the various 
group activities carried on in the class-room and in the 
general life and activities and enterprises of the school,, 
and to build up the proper attitude of mind toward 
the social situations that arise. This problem involves 
the recognition of the adolescent social instincts and 
provision for bringing them to full fruition in normal, 
sane, and constructive ways. This service can not be 
rendered effectively by incidental means, but should 
have very adequate and definite agencies provided for 
insuring that this phase of mental maturity shall not 
be neglected or attended to in any half-hearted, hap- 
hazard manner. This problem will be discussed in de- 
tail under the chapter on the development and control 
of conduct or behavior. 
THE FUNCTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL SUBJECTS 
The general point of view.—The general idea in 
regard to the function of the high school subjects is 
that they should be a means to an end, and not an end 
in and of themselves. The vital issue is that of deter- 
mining the valid ends whose accomplishment may be 
effectively secured through the use of the high school 
subjects. In the light of the point of view that is 
herein held concerning the function of the secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 43 
school, one may say that the function of every subject 
that is brought into the high school curriculum must 
be to contribute definitely to some aspect of physical 
or mental maturing of the adolescent boy or girl. If 
each subject is so organized and administered that 
it does become an effective means to these ends, it 
will at the same time accomplish the further end of 
contributing definitely to the preparation of the indi- 
vidual for entering a college of liberal arts, a profes- 
sional school, a technical school, or to take up some 
vocational pursuit that does not require extended tech- 
nical or professional training. That is to say, the 
primary function of the high school subjects is not to 
prepare the pupils for the study of advanced courses 
in the same field or’in other fields to which the sub- 
jects may be considered prerequisites, but rather to 
make the pupils mentally mature enough so that as a 
result they will be thoroughly prepared for the further 
development that the study of advanced courses might 
bring to them. The main objective, then, is to bring 
the pupils up to as high a stage of maturity as possible 
by the proper adaptation of the subject-matter to meet 
their present ability to grow. The critical problem in 
this connection is that of determining clearly the 
mental and physical maturity to which the particular 
subject is supposed to contribute definitely and vitally. 
Another way of saying what has just been set forth 
is that each high school subject must exist for the sake 
of the pupils and not for the sake of some preconceived
-P-A-G-E-58
  44 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
traditional academic standard of so-called scholarship. 
The subjects must lose themselves in becoming a part 
of the life of the adolescent being. The goal must be 
units of human development or maturing, rather than 
units of subject-matter completed. Each so-called unit 
of subject-matter must have its human counterpart, 
for which it must always exist. The course of study 
should be written in terms of these human units of 
development, and the subject-matter materials should 
be subordinated to these human units, which are the 
real goals of education. The first step in carrying out 
this point of view is that of stating the function of 
each subject in terms of the exact contribution it will 
make in bringing into existence these human units of 
development in the life of the adolescent boy or girl. 
is language. The only way r one has of knowing that he 
has ideas is through the symbols by which he expresses 
his experiences to his own mind and to the minds of 
others. All forms of symbols ultimately _re rest upon 
language. “That is to say, pictures, motions, ‘objects, 
ete., can become symbols of ideas only when they can 
be translated into language that is appropriate to rep- 
resent their significance to the mind of the one who 
uses them, and also to the mind of the one who ob- 
serves them and interprets them as expressing the 
thought of the user. This being true, the most funda- 
mental function of language is to furnish ish the learner 
with an adequate tool with which to symbolize and _
-P-A-G-E-59
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 45 
organize his increasing range of experience. That is to 
say, the most vital function n of English is to expand the _ 
adolescent's unit of concept of thinking, both from the 
standpoint of interpretation : and from the standpoint oint of 
expression. The term expression is here used to mean 
not only the actual use of oral and written speech, but 
also the organizing and thinking out of things in one’s 
own mind when the thoughts thus constructed are not 
put into oral or written language. 
As has been suggested above under the discussion of 
the mental maturing of the adolescent, the unit of 
concept has three parallel forms of existence in the 
mind of the learner. These forms are the sentence, 
the paragraph, and the theme or story, or total pro- 
duction. There is, however, another form of the unit 
of concept of thinking that should be given careful 
attention. This form is the relation that the lan- 
guage symbols bear to the ideas they are used to 
express. 
There are three types of such language relations— 
namely, the literal relation, the figurative relation, and 
the symbolical relation. The learner passes through 
three stages of development in the interpretation of his 
own experiences and in the interpretation of the ideas 
of others that correspond to these three types of rela- 
tion. He first thinks of every language symbol as 
having its exact literal significance. That is to say, he 
interprets all language of others as literal in meaning. 
And he has no thoughts or ideas to express except
-P-A-G-E-60
  46 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
those that employ the literal significance or language 
symbols. The time comes in his development, how- 
ever, when he has ideas that can not be expressed ade- 
quately by the employment of literal speech. There- 
fore he invents figurative forms of language. He also 
hears others use similar figures of speech, and he recog- 
nizes the difference between this form of language and 
the literal form that he is accustomed to use and to 
hear used. As he acquires more and more experiences 
his ideas become so complex and his powers of dis- 
crimination so developed that he thinks many fine 
shades of meaning that can not be expressed by the 
use of either literal speech or by the use of simple 
figures of speech. Therefore he invents more and more 
subtle figurative forms of expression. He likewise 
interprets and appreciates the more complex and subtle 
figures of speech employed by others. 
This growth in interpreting and expressing the sig- 
nificance of his own experiences and in interpreting 
the significances of the forms of the expressions of the 
experiences of others finally culminates in the need 
for the use of symbolical speech. Symbolical language 
may be considered as the highest form of figurative 
speech. It is a form of expression, however, that is 
broader in the scope of materials used than is possible 
in mere language figures of speech. Ultimately some 
form of language lies back of every form of symbolical 
expression. Painting and sculpturing are the most 
subtle forms of symbolical expression. The artist re-
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 47 
sorts to the use of graphic representations to express 
shades of meaning and thought complexes that can not 
be adequately presented by the mere use of words. 
The language that gives the literal and the symbolical 
significance of the painting or the sculptured form is 
very clearly although subtly implied. The unity of the 
whole, however, is sensed emotionally rather than 
intellectually comprehended. 
A second important function of English is to con- 
tribute to the social phase of the adolescent’s mental 
maturing. The social maturity of the individual ex- 
hibits three fundamental stages of growth. The first 
of these is that of selfish individualism. In this stage 
the individual is wont to think of the world as belong- 
ing to him, or at least as owing him a living. He is an 
autocrat and egotist, and expects others to give way to 
his selfish desires. The second stage is that of ambi- 
tious competition for social recognition and prestige. 
This stage develops more or less of the instinct of gre- 
gariousness, but the individual selects the groups to 
which he attaches himself, upon the basis of their help- 
fulness in the accomplishing of his own ends. The 
third stage is that of altruistic service through co- 
operation and unselfish contributions to the general 
welfare of all mankind. The individual seeks affilia- 
tion with every group that promises opportunity for 
service to others. He seeks to lose his individual life 
through living a broader life of agreeable social contact 
with all mankind. The great opportunity of English gates Gn et ss eee eee   
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  48 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
_is, through the medium of language, to bring this 
broader contact with the ideals, the emotions, and the 
humanizing experiences of 1 Toany persone with whom 
the adolescent could. could not. come in personal contact, 
even though they were all living. In order to capitalize 
this opportunity most fully, however, the materials of 
literature must be very carefully selected and- graded, 
to meet not only this social aspect of mental maturity, 
but also all the other phases of the intellectual and 
emotional development of the adolescent. pupil. = 
If one takes this point of view as to the function of 
English, he can readily work out the kinds of lan- 
guage and literary material that will contribute most 
effectively to these two aspects of the development of 
the unit of concept of thinking at any particular stage 
of its growth. The critical problem is that of meas- 
uring accurately the range of growth in this particular 
phase of mental maturing that should be readily at- 
tained during each year of high school English work. 
These ranges can be determined only by very thorough 
and careful experimentation. Such experimentation 
will never be secured, however, as long as educators 
think of the high school English in terms of the sub- 
ject. The real science of English as presented through 
grammar, rhetoric, composition, and literature should 
be constructed as the counterparts of these definite 
aspects of mental maturing. 
The function of foreign language studies.—The 
most fundamental function that foreign language 
   
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 49 
studies may serve is that of contributing very definitely 
to the development of the sentence unit of thinking 
that may be especially developed by language material 
of this kind. The paragraph is also developed by this 
sort of material if it is handled in the right way. That 
is to say, the foreign languages offer a splendid type of 
material with which to expand the ability of the indi- 
vidual to think the logical relationships involved in the 
interpretation of more and more extended and complex 
sentences and more and more extended and complex 
paragraphs. Some argue that every phase of such 
mental development can be secured by means of Eng- 
lish material alone just as thoroughly as can possibly 
be secured through the use of foreign languages. This 
argument rests upon the fundamental psychological 
truth that language elements and language habits are 
universal phases of logical relationships of ideas, and 
are independent of word forms, which merely sym- 
bolize ideas. That is to say, the part of speech, noun, 
verb, etc., subject and predicate, and the forms of 
sentence, declarative, imperative, etc., are universal 
elements and habits of thinking that are universal. 
The various forms of words that different groups of 
people may use to express these elements and habits of 
thinking are so many synonyms, which have come into 
existence through mere chance and accident. 
This argument, while psychologically true, overlooks 
one point that is worth consideration. This point is 
the fact that pupils so readily fall into the habit of 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  50 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
making more or less intelligent guesses as to the real 
meaning of a sentence or a paragraph when they read 
in the native tongue alone. The individual words may 
seem familiar, and yet the thought may be difficult of 
interpretation. The pupil catches the familiar ideas 
and constructs a thought that may seem plausible to 
his mind, but that may be far from accurate. Now, 
the foreign language material demands a more careful 
analysis of the relationships that are involved in mak- 
ing an accurate translation of the thought into familiar 
ideas. The pupil may guess, to be sure; but he is just 
as likely to guess himself into a greater difficulty as he 
is to guess his way through the interpretation, for he 
must explain his guesses ultimately by making the 
detailed analysis of the logical relationships involved 
in such interpretation. The critical issue is the devel- 
opment of certain little language habits and their co- 
ordination into larger and larger language or thought 
habits, until all the parts of the complex language 
habit of interpretation that are involved in inter- 
preting a very complex sentence unit function accu- 
rately and smoothly. The attempt to interpret a for- 
eign language brings out these exact smaller language 
habits, and shows how they must be developed first 
separately, and then combined into larger and larger 
groups, until they are finally brought together in the 
larger language situations. 
Therefore one may safely conclude that the foreign 
language materials are economical and convenient
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 51 
means of developing the unit of concept in thinking. 
One may further conclude that the foreign language 
materials reduce the possibility of guessing to the 
minimum and increase the necessity of detailed accu- 
rate analysis to the maximum. The content of the 
subject-matter that is studied in the foreign language 
material may be unimportant, and therefore the mind 
of the learner is free to attend to the mastery of the 
language habits themselves, whereas if the content 
were supposed to be important and had to be learned 
after it was worked out into familiar terms, the pupil 
would be more inclined to guess at the content or to 
hunt for a “pony” to ride through the content. Then 
again, if important content is involved, the learner 
becomes tired of it by the time he has mouthed it over 
as much as will be necessary in order to master accu- 
rately the language habits involved. 
The foreign languages may serve the function of 
affording the means of carrying on communication 
with people who do not use the English language. 
This function contributes to the development of the 
social aspect of the individual’s mental maturing. 
That is to say, his social contacts are increased and his 
social outlook may be broadened. He may realize 
through his new power of communication the possi- 
bility of entering broader fields of service to mankind 
than he could have realized without it. He may dis- 
cover very fine ideational and emotional materials in 
the new language, which will broaden his social outlook
-P-A-G-E-66
52 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
by giving him a new concept of the universality of 
human philosophy and experiences. This function of 
foreign language is thought by some to be the most 
important, but for the greater number of the adoles- 
cent pupils who are helped in their maturing through 
the study of these materials the first function is by far 
the most important. 
The function of mathematics——The mathematical 
subjects serve at least two functions in the education of 
the adolescent boy or girl. One function is that of 
contributing actual experiences in conceiving and real- 
izing quantitative values, and the other is that of 
contributing special forms of language with which to 
interpret and express quantitative ideas. That is to 
say, mathematical material, rightly handled, develops 
the unit of concept of thinking in terms of quantitative 
values, which are expressed in a special form of lan- 
guage relationships. At the same time, this material 
demands the checking up on the validity of the lan- 
guage relationships through the comparison of quanti- 
tative experiences and values. Therefore one might 
say truly that the two functions really merge into the 
one function of expanding the unit of concept of think- 
ing quantitative values as a coherent scheme or science 
of measuring all types of human experiences and 
activities. 
The function of algebra is chiefly that of furnishing a 
convenient form of language with which to manipulate 
very complex and extended number relationships. In
-P-A-G-E-67
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 53 
order to realize the value of this form of language, 
however, the pupil must face number experiences that 
call for interpretation of complex quantitative values. 
Therefore the first step in teaching the pupil by means 
of algebra is that of giving him number experiences 
and of bringing him face to face with opportunities 
for using number relationships. As the pupil becomes 
acquainted with the general truths of mathematical 
experiences, he recognizes the advantage of having a 
convenient form of symbolism with which to express 
these generalizations. Hence he realizes the value of 
the algebraic formule and finds it worth while to mas- 
ter the scheme of language notations that affords him 
a new tool with which to carry on his thinking in con- 
nection with all kinds of complex mathematical ex- 
periences. 
The critical problem in determining the function of 
algebra is that of selecting the quantitative or mathe- 
matical experiences that are both possible and desirable 
to bring to the adolescent pupil. Once this point is 
settled, the selection of the algebraic vocabulary or 
range of formule can be readily and accurately accom- 
plished. This whole problem must no doubt be solved 
by careful experimentation and thoroughgoing psycho- 
logical diagnoses of what actually goes on in the mind 
of the adolescent boy or girl in the way of acquiring 
real and vital mathematical experiences. The vital 
point that should never be lost sight of is that the 
pupil should not be set at the task of mastering the
-P-A-G-E-68
    54 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
language notations of algebraic formule until he has 
need for such language as a means of manipulating his 
number experiences, and then he should acquire the 
vocabulary only as fast as he has real necessity for it. 
Geometry has as its chief function the building up of 
definite spatial concepts. Its second function is that of 
furnishing a convenient form of language with which 
to organize the pupil’s expanding spatial universe. 
Spatial experiences are the most common and perhaps 
the most fundamental of human experiences as far as 
getting control over the physical universe is concerned. 
These spatial concepts are used as a means of making 
all sorts of comparisons in one’s attempt to express 
subtle shades of meaning. For example, one speaks of 
approaching a problem from every angle. This is a 
vivid way of saying that no possible data or consid- 
eration will be omitted in the thinking out of the 
solution of the problem. Such expressions as an out- 
standing man, a low desire, a deep-seated effect, etc., 
are translations of spatial experiences and concepts 
into representations of the more subtle mental experi- 
ences and organization of ideas. 
The very first and most fundamental spatial con- 
cepts are termed geography instead of geometry. 
When mankind faced the necessity of dealing more 
accurately with its spatial world than the terminology 
of geography enabled it to do, it invented a new form 
of language, known as geometry. That is to say, the 
science of geography was at first merely a matter of
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 55 
defining directions and locating things in relation to 
accepted landmarks. As soon as there was need for 
establishing very accurate locations of important 
things, quantitative measurements were necessary, and 
mathematical geography came into existence. That is 
to say, man invented a new form of language with 
which to manipulate his spatial experiences, which 
were fast becoming so manifold and so extended and 
complex that general terms and broad guesses no 
longer satisfied the situation. The attempt to refine 
spatial concepts and to adapt language to their expres- 
sion built up the science of geometry. Therefore it is 
valid to conclude that the language of geometry is 
important only as it is a means of expressing definite 
concepts of spatial experiences. 
The difficult part of the problem, in determining the 
contribution that geometry should make to the educa- 
tion of high school pupils, is that of discovering the 
kinds of spatial experiences and concepts that these 
pupils already have and also the degree to which they 
have defined them. That is to say, the unit of concept 
in manipulating spatial experiences must be accurately 
measured as it now exists, and then the possibility of 
its expansion must be determined. This possibility 
must be established ultimately upon an experimental 
basis. The language aspect of geometry can easily be 
adapted to meet the growing refinement of the adoles- 
cent’s spatial experiences. 
The function of “combined mathematics” is to put
-P-A-G-E-70
  56 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the emphasis upon mathematical experiences and to 
adapt mathematical language to the present need for 
manipulating these experiences. That is to say, the 
pupil is given algebraic symbols as a means of meet- 
ing a particular mathematical situation, and not as a 
part of a coherent scheme of language notations. Like- 
wise the pupil is given geometrical language whenever 
it is the most advantageous means of expressing the 
mathematical relationships involved in a particular 
situation, and not as a part of a definite language 
science. Ultimately, however, the pupil may acquire a 
rather definite algebraic vocabulary and a fairly well 
defined range of geometrical symbols. The aim and 
the emphasis is upon the mental operations that go on 
within the mind of the pupil as a result of his mathe- 
matical experiences, rather than upon the task of 
manipulating the peculiar set of language symbols 
through all its possible notations. 
The function of history.—The subject-matter of 
history serves at least two functions in contributing to 
the mental maturity of the adolescent boy or girl. One 
function is that of furnishing an ample body of inter- 
esting facts about the conduct and behavior of indi- 
viduals and of groups of individuals in their attempts 
to carry on the various activities that devolve upon 
the citizens of a country. The second function is that 
of expanding the adolescent’s unit of concept in think- 
ing out the fundamental problems of human relation- 
ships as they are involved in the connection of each 
 
-P-A-G-E-71
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 57 
and every citizen with the different forms of institu- 
tional life through which the progress and develop- 
ment of civilization are brought about. That is to 
say, the great function of history is to contribute 
vitally to the social aspect of the pupil’s mental 
maturity. The adolescent is a citizen in the making, 
hence he needs a broader and yet broader acquaintance, 
first with the actual facts of how people are behaving 
now in reference to the important problems of citizen- 
ship, and second with how people have behaved in the 
past in reference to these same problems. 
The most important function of history is that of 
broadening the individual’s social outlook through 
training his mind to make accurate judgments, which 
are based upon an adequate body of data, concerning 
the significance of the acts that individuals and groups 
of individuals have put forth in attempting to get 
along together in this world. The securing of a ra- 
tional mental attitude and the development of reflec- 
tive habits of judgment-forming are vastly more valu- 
able than is the mere accumulation of facts. The 
ability to remember a sufficiently large body of facts 
for a sufficient length of time that will enable one to 
analyze their significance is necessary, however, and 
should not be overlooked. Therefore one of the ways 
in which the employment of historical material may be 
made to contribute to mental development is that of 
building up economical and effective habits of memori- 
zation of really important data.
-P-A-G-E-72
58 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
The function of civics is virtually the same as that 
of history. In fact, it is only a special field of social 
development. The adolescent pupil needs political and 
legal experiences of the kind that make him familiar 
with the actual forms of society that are organized and 
carried on in his immediate community, in the larger 
state community, and in the national community. He 
needs to see his own position in the scheme of social 
regulation of the behavior of human beings, and espe- 
cially to realize the obligations and rights of citizen- 
ship that must come to him when he reaches the legal 
status of adulthood. Here again the vital point is not 
the mere accumulation of facts, but the making of valid 
judgments that are based upon facts and experience. 
The subject-matter of civics, rightly handled, affords 
the opportunity of thinking in more and more complex 
units of thought in a limited social field. That is to 
say, the individual should develop a greater and greater 
span of judgment of a highly specialized kind. 
The function of sociology.—The chief function of 
sociology is that of making adolescent boys and girls 
acquainted with very special forms of human behavior 
and particular bodies of facts concerning the conditions 
under which various individuals and groups of indi- 
viduals live. A second function is that of developing 
the habit of making valid judgments about these 
special phases of human behavior and welfare. The 
most important point is that the present facts and the 
very closely related past facts concerning sedial con-
-P-A-G-E-73
  
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 59 
ditions and problems should be given great emphasis. 
The actual experiences of the now are the material 
with which to build up the unit of thinking in terms 
of social ideas and to expand the span of judgment- 
forming in terms of significant social problems. The 
function of elementary sociology is not to theorize 
about the evolution of man as a living being, nor to 
speculate about the development of the family as a 
social institution, etc., but rather to show what kind 
of institution the family is now under present condi- 
tions and to see what manner of being man now ex- 
hibits himself to be. That is to say, the present con- 
ditions of human living are the fundamental materials 
with which to broaden the adolescent’s social horizon. 
The function of the general life of the school.—The 
teaching of the high school pupil by means of the 
subject-matter of sociology alone will not bring satis- 
factory results. The social maturity of the adolescent 
individual is brought about through the actual social 
contacts that are constantly being made in school and 
out of school with individuals and with various groups 
of individuals. That is to say, the vital subject-matter 
of social education is in actual living contacts with 
people in the now. The social instincts and impulses 
of the adolescent are guided and his social habits ulti- 
mately crystallized by what he actually does in relation 
to his fellows as he passes through the secondary stage 
of development. Therefore the general life of the 
school in the class-room, on the campus, in the assem- 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  60 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
bly, at the athletic contests, at the debating contest, in 
the musical, literary, and dramatic entertainments, 
etc., is of the highest importance and of the most vital 
significance. The study of social facts that are set 
forth in books, and the discussion of social problems 
that are fundamental in the life of the whole people of 
our nation, may serve to make the adolescent pupil 
more intelligent and more observant in regard to these 
vital issues of citizenship. But what will it profit to 
make the pupil intelligent about the problem of 
divorce, for example, and at the same time fail to 
capitalize his actual social contacts in setting up in his 
mind such ideals and reverence for love and home that 
these things become too sacred to be lightly entered 
into or to be hastily cast aside? 
The crux of the whole problem of social education of 
the adolescent pupil is in what he actually lives here 
and now in conjunction with his fellows, and not in 
what subject-matter materials he reads in books of any 
sort. There has been much talk about socializing the 
curricula. The chief idea seems to be that the subject- 
matter of the various subjects can be written in terms 
of such social facts and factors, social conditions, or 
rather descriptions and discussions of social conditions, 
that the study of these bodies of subject-matter will 
render the individual truly social in spirit and in ability 
to contribute to the welfare of society as a whole. 
This idea has certain psychological truth behind it in 
regard to motivation of school work. But it does not
-P-A-G-E-75
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 61 
meet the most critical need and does not serve the most 
vital function of the school in bringing about real social 
education and development of the adolescent boy or 
girl. Therefore the school should provide for the 
carrying on of real social experiences, and it should 
provide for enough expert adolescent sociological- 
psychologists on its teaching staff, so that the manifold 
social materials of actual life in the class-room, in the 
assembly, in the intermissions, etc., shall not be allowed 
to be wasted or to be perverted in the formation of 
anti-social habits. The human elements out of which 
good character and good citizenship may be con- 
structed, or out of which the opposites may be built, 
must be dealt with just as systematically and just as 
thoroughly as must the mental elements involved in 
expanding the unit of concept of thinking through the 
study of mathematics or any other subject. That is to 
say, the unit of social judgment must be expanded 
through definite social contacts that are organized 
around fundamental social ideas. 
Every teacher has opportunity to contribute some- 
thing to the social education of his pupils. But the 
class-room teacher must give so much time and energy 
to bringing about the desired mental maturity by 
means of the special subject that he has neither the 
time nor the opportunity to follow up the social ten- 
dencies that are obvious in the behavior of his pupils 
during the class period. An expert adolescent psychol- 
ogist, however, whose job it is to do this very thing, 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  62 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
could have a regular schedule of class-room visitations 
in which he would gather the materials for his work 
with individual pupils and with various groups of 
pupils. Often, too, social situations would require the 
holding of individual conferences of such a character 
that only a woman should handle the girls and only a 
man the boys. 
Frequently, however, the problems would involve the 
meeting of groups that might be handled best in some 
instances by a woman and in other cases by a man. 
This might be true whether the group was a mixed 
group or whether it was a segregated sex group. For 
instance, a strictly boys’ group might best be dealt 
with by a woman in one case and by a man in another 
case, and the same holds true of a strictly girls’ group 
or with mixed groups. The critical point is that the 
living materials shall not be neglected. The class- 
room teacher can supplement the visits of the social 
education developer by giving him the results of his 
daily contact with his pupils. This will be very im- 
portant in connection with emergency situations and 
in regard to certain unusual individual cases. The co- 
operation between the class-room teacher and the 
social and moral character educator will contribute 
vitally to the type of work that each is doing most 
intensively. 
The work of the expert adolescent psychologist 
might be done in the smaller high schools by the prin- 
cipal, provided he is given the time for this in addition 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 63 
to his administrative duties, instead of being required 
to teach a number of high school classes. The larger 
high schools, however, should have teachers engaged 
for this specific work; for the principal has too many 
general administrative duties to perform, and lack of 
time will not permit him to follow up effectively 
socially ripe situations and clues to individual ten- 
dencies. He is usually called into the play only when 
some emergency situation arises, and then too often 
the best opportunity for constructive social education 
of the person or persons involved has been lost. That 
is to say, he is called upon to cure the outcropping of a 
social disaffection that might have been prevented from 
ever coming into existence. The doctrine of preventive 
hygiene is just as valid in the realm of social education 
as it is in physical education, and it requires the same 
sort of definite provision on the part of the secondary 
school. 
The function of economics.—The function of eco- 
nomics is that of enlarging the pupil’s mental horizon 
by giving him an acquaintance with the most practical 
and fundamental facts and factors concerning the 
production, exchange, and consumption of the com- 
modities that are involved in living and in living well. 
The adolescent is particularly interested in matters 
concerning material wealth. He occupies a peculiar 
position in respect to economic problems, and he is 
greatly influenced by the promises held out by this, 
that, and the other economic situation that seems to 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
   
   64 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
offer great material opportunities. What the adoles- 
cent individual especially needs is insight in regard to 
the manipulation and control of economic conditions. 
That is to say, he needs to know what is actually going 
on in the economic phase of human activities. Then, 
too, his ability to make accurate judgments of more 
and more complex nature, in terms of the economic 
relationships that are vital in getting on well in the 
world, should be developed as his stock of mental 
materials increases. 
The function of commercial geography is virtually 
the same as that of economics. It contributes to the 
mental maturity of the adolescent pupil by enlarging 
his stock of actual knowledge concerning the existence 
of important commercial facts and factors. It like- 
wise contributes to some extent to the social aspect of 
the pupil’s mental maturity by enlightening him in 
regard to the behavior of individuals and groups of 
individuals in respect to their taking advantage of the 
various facts and factors that figure in the carrying on 
of fundamental commercial activities. 
The function of the biological sciences.—The chief 
function that should be served by the biological sci- 
ences is that of giving the adolescent boy or girl a 
great wealth of sensory and ideational experiences. 
That is to say, these sciences should bring the high 
school pupil into contact with the actual existences of 
the biological world. Botany, for example, should 
make the pupil acquainted with his plant environment.  
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 65 
It should make him intelligent about the purposes for 
which these plants live and the manner in which the 
plants live in order to carry out these purposes. The 
important point is that the pupil should actually come 
in contact with as many forms of plant life as his 
environment makes possible. This contact should in- 
clude not merely the seeing and handling of plants as 
gross existence, but also seeing the essential structure 
and observing the life processes of at least the simpler 
forms of plants. 
The same essential experience-getting idea should 
hold for the functions that zodlogy, agriculture, and 
general science should serve. The pupil should be 
made acquainted first with his own zodlogical and agri- 
cultural environment, and later with a larger scope of 
animal and agricultural existences than is afforded by 
his immediate surroundings. Here again the important 
point is actual contact with both the gross existence of 
things and also contact with the essential structure 
and fundamental life processes of animals and with 
the important phases of agricultural activities. This 
contact should also include the purposes for which all 
of these facts and factors exist and their relations to 
the general welfare of humanity. Habits of judgment- 
forming and of careful observation and interpretation 
of actual experiences will necessarily be involved in 
carrying on the performance of experience-getting. 
The attention to scientific classification and the for- 
mulation of scientific laws should be determined by the
-P-A-G-E-80
  66 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
need felt by the learner for a more economical and con- 
venient means of organizing his experiences than is 
afforded by his ordinary vocabulary and manner of 
putting things. The extent to which actual wealth of 
experience is brought to the pupil will be the chief 
factor in deciding this issue. The ultimate result of 
wide experience is the recognition of general charac- 
teristics and of the setting up of definite concepts, 
definitions, and generalizations. Therefore if one holds 
to this experience-getting idea strictly, he need not be 
concerned about whether or not osmosis, for example, 
will come up in connection with the study of plants, or 
whether it will come up in the study of animals, or in 
some other connection. In other words, scientific prin- 
ciples, concepts, and definitions will be taken into 
account whenever and wherever they come up in the 
natural course of experience-getting, and they will be 
given just the attention that is necessary to make them 
helpful to the pupil at that point in his development. 
The function of the physical sciences.—The chief 
function of the physical sciences is that of contrib- 
uting to the mental maturity of the adolescent pupil 
through giving him wide range of experiences and 
contacts with physical phenomena. The accumulation 
of experiences will ultimately lead to the necessity for 
classification and organization. Then, the function of 
the physical sciences is to establish clear definitions 
and concepts that are usable in arranging experiences 
into such coherent schemes of organization as will ren-
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 67 
der them of practical value in employing the forces of 
nature to advantage. That is to say, physics, chem- 
istry, physical geography, and elementary geology 
should not be employed primarily with the idea of 
making the high school pupil a scientist in any of 
these fields. No set order of arrangement of scientific 
principles should be undertaken. The existence of 
such principles in manifold situations out in the world 
should be brought to the pupil through actual contact 
with natural phenomena and with the various appli- 
ances that man has invented in his attempt to harness 
the forces of nature to the doing of work. 
Physical sciences, then, should contribute many facts 
and ideas to the high school pupils, but in addition to 
this service they should develop very definite habits of 
thinking in terms of the physical universe. That is to 
say, they should extend the pupil’s unit of concept in 
thinking physical relationships, and they should 
lengthen the judgment span in dealing with more and 
more complex physical situations. Habits of careful 
and accurate observation should be developed, and the 
making of careful interpretations of the significance of 
physical phenomena, based upon an adequate amount 
of data. 
The function of home economics.—The subjects of 
cooking, sewing, and home-making should have as their 
chief function the development of definite skills and 
the mastery of fundamental bodies of useful knowl- 
edge. That is to say, the adolescent pupil should  
-P-A-G-E-82
  68 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
actually perform the various operations involved in 
these arts until she both knows what to do and how to 
do it well. The school must afford ample opportunities 
for real experience-getting in these fields. Moreover, 
these experiences must be organized and made to con- 
tribute vitally to the acquisition of the desired skills 
that are so essential to the development of the modern 
home life. 
The function of the manual arts.—The first function 
that the manual arts should serve is that of giving the 
adolescent a wide range of experience in relation to 
materials, tools, and constructive operations. A second 
function is that the manual subjects should be made 
to contribute definitely to the physical development 
of the high school pupil, so that his general health is 
improved through exercise and through the physical 
strength that is developed by carrying on the various 
manual activities. The function of actual mastery of 
mechanical skill that may be commercialized is also a 
valid one, but it should not be pressed too much. 
Rather, let the experience-getting idea predominate, 
and let the matter of marketable skill be a matter of 
individual choice and native tendency. Opportunity for 
vocational training should be provided in the middle 
and upper years of the school. 
The function of the fine arts.—The fine arts should 
serve the function of giving the adolescent pupil a 
wealth of contact with the world of harmonious sounds, 
colors, and forms. Enrichment of experience is the 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 69 
foremost idea, leaving the matter of artistic skill to the 
choice of the individual. Another function of these 
arts is that of furnishing a new form of language with 
which to manipulate and organize this wealth of sen- 
sory and emotional experiences. The nomenclature of 
music is a new form of language, and may be made the 
means of expanding the unit of concept in thinking out 
harmonious relationships of tone and rhythm. Draw- 
ing and painting are graphic forms of speech, and may 
serve to give the learner greater freedom of expression 
of his own experiences and ideas, and also give greater 
power of interpretation of the subtle expressions of the 
ideals of others. 
Another function of the fine arts is to give oppor- 
tunities for intellectual and emotional enjoyment. 
That is to say, these forms of experience should de- 
velop ranges of appreciation and a sense of the appro- 
priate and beautiful in reference to the relationships of 
sound, color, and form. This aspect of experience- 
getting should include both the appreciation and en- 
joyment that come through interpretation of esthetic 
experiences, and the appreciation and enjoyment that 
come through the execution or creation of esthetic 
forms. 
The function of physical education.—The function 
of physical education should be the development of 
sound bodies and the building up of adequate health 
habits. Therefore this aspect of education of the 
adolescent should include physiology and hygiene, cor-
-P-A-G-E-84
  70 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
rective exercises, recreative sports and games, and com- 
petitive sports and games. The chief idea throughout 
all of these should be the giving of actual experience in 
health-building through physical experiences of vari- 
ous kinds that are adapted to the needs of individuals 
and the needs of groups. One important point, to be 
sure, is the acquisition of practical knowledge concern- 
ing the care of the human body and the creating of a 
healthful environment in which to live and enjoy life. 
A vital function of physical education is that of 
contributing to the social aspect of the mental maturity 
of the adolescent boy or girl. Recreative sports and 
games and competitive sports and games afford splen- 
did opportunities for giving actual social experiences 
and for developing moral social habits. The unit of 
concept in thinking out the more and more complex 
social relationships may be developed to a very great 
degree. Moreover, the setting up of proper social 
ideals and attitudes may ‘be secured in a way that no 
other phase of school life may possibly bring out. 
Therefore physical education might very well include 
such social activities as parties and dances, which the 
school may carry on from time to time in response to 
the social needs and desires of the adolescent indi- 
vidual. A great deal of the actual participation of the 
individual in these social games and in these other 
social activities is necessarily physical. That is to say, 
the playing of games and dancing are fundamental 
forms of social reaction that help to give one physical
-P-A-G-E-85
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 71 
ease and poise, as well as graceful motor facilities that 
enable one to codperate with others in pleasurable 
pastimes. 
The function of commercial subjects——The com- 
mercial subjects serve two important functions, 
namely, the giving of important bodies of practical 
knowledge, and the developing of skills that are mar- 
ketable. The chief function is that of giving skills that 
enable the pupil to earn a living in the commercial 
world. The bodies of knowledge that are presented in 
connection with commercial lines of study are neces- 
sary, for the most part, and instrumental in helping 
the pupils to master the desired forms of skill. That is 
to say, the function of commercial subjects is to make 
the pupil a bookkeeper, a stenographer, etc. They are 
definitely vocational in content and practice. 
IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF MENTAL MATURITY 
Two important considerations.—One of the impor- 
tant psychological facts that should be kept in mind is 
that many individuals make very slow intellectual de- 
velopment in the early years of maturity just following 
the secondary period, and in fact may grow very 
slowly during the remainder of their lives. In other 
words, the secondary period of development brings a 
large number of individuals up to what is practically 
the level of their intellectual capabilities. 
This psychological fact should be given most careful  
-P-A-G-E-86
  
  72 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
consideration by college and university, and especially 
by that institution that has been wont to judge the 
efficiency of the work done by the high schools on the 
record made by the graduates of these high schools 
during their freshman year in the higher institution. 
The pupil who has developed satisfactorily in the high 
school may have reached so near the level of his pos- 
sible mental maturity that he will make slow progress 
during his freshman year in the higher institution. 
Moreover, his college teachers may not be so efficient 
as were his high school teachers, and they may not 
know how to secure the highest possible growth by 
proper adaptation of the subject-matter that they pre- 
sent. The higher educational institution is presuming 
that its teaching staff is virtually perfect, that the 
conditions for growth are all ideal, and that its stand- 
ards of measurement are accurate and infallible, when 
it sends the records of its freshmen back to the various 
high schools. The idea that these records may be 
evidences of weakness and inefficiency on its own part 
seems not to have occurred to the higher institution. 
It is presuming to show the high schools the evidences 
of their weakness and inefficiencies. The truth may be 
that the high school has done wonderfully well with 
the pupils under its charge, and that the higher insti- 
tution has not builded on the foundation laid by the 
high school. Again, the high school may have done 
well and the higher institution may have done equally 
as well in making its courses conform to the stage of
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 73 
mental maturity reached at the close of the secondary 
school, and yet the pupil may make little measurable 
progress, although he strives faithfully. That is to 
say, the pupil may have reached the stage where, slow 
development is inevitable. 
The second consideration is the psychological fact 
that every individual sways back and forth between 
his interest in acquiring facts and theories and skills, 
and the employment of facts, theories, and skills in 
doing things. Throughout the elementary school the 
emphasis is upon the acquisition of facts, theories, and 
certain skills. The pupil is in his childhood and gen- 
erally obeys readily the demands made upon him by 
the institution. The adolescent period finds the youth 
equipped with a more or less comprehensive body of 
facts, theories, and skills, and possessed by the impulse 
to find self-expression in the doing of things. Through- 
out high school the struggle between the subjects that 
demand long storing-up periods and the subjects that 
turn things loose—that is to say, put facts, theories, 
and skills into practice by affording opportunities for 
doing things—wages hotly with varying fortunes of 
war. Now, this same situation exists when the high 
school graduate enters the higher educational institu- 
tion. The pupil may have endured the storing-up 
process in the high school fairly well, but when he 
enters college and finds that he must continue this 
process indefinitely or even through his freshman year, 
he balks at the task and seeks relief through an excess
-P-A-G-E-88
  74 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of social activities, athletics, or whatever avenues of 
active doing are most available and most satisfying. 
The result is that the pupil makes no development 
through his classes, although he is perfectly capable of 
doing so to a high degree. Here again it seems fair to 
say that perhaps neither the high school, the higher 
institution, nor the individual is really at fault. This 
individual may have reached the point where active 
doing is going to claim him for a time before he will be 
satisfied to pass through another storing-up period of 
very long duration. In fact, his freshman year may be 
the means of satisfying him that he is best adapted to 
doing the things that he is now capable of doing with 
his present equipment. 
An important consideration for technical and pro- 
fessional schools.—The fact that the high school is so 
largely a period of maturing and of storing up of 
mental materials should receive most careful attention 
by the technical and professional schools. (The techni- 
cal or professional school should confine its efforts to 
training people in the skills necessary to be efficient in 
its particular field.) Its courses should not require the 
taking of subjects that merely demand storing up of 
facts that have no vital connection with the problems 
in the particular technical or professional field, either 
in the way of helping very materially in the mastery 
of the technical or professional subjects, or in the put- 
ting of technical or professional skills into effective 
practice. The degrees of mental maturity necessary
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE MODERN CONCEPTION OF THE HIGH SCHOOL 75 
and the kinds and amounts of facts and skills that are 
actually prerequisites to the taking up of technical or 
professional lines of study should be secured before the 
pupil enters such a school. The technical school should 
be able to say just what these are, and then the educa- 
tional institution, or institutions that are committed to 
the task of maturing and developing human beings in 
order that they may find their capabilities and also be 
equipped to make the most of them, will know how to 
advise and to guide their pupils in the choosing of a 
life work. 
SUMMARY 
The modern conception of the high school is based 
upon the idea that the human being during his sec- 
ondary period of existence is virtually being born again 
mentally, morally, and to a certain degree physically. 
The adolescent being is very unstable in his reactions, 
and presents the greatest possibilities for education 
through systematic training. The function of the sec- 
ondary or high school is to provide for every aspect of 
human development in order to mature the pupil who 
is passing through the most critical period of his life. 
The fundamental phases of human maturity that 
should be furthered by the school are physical and 
mental, which includes both the intellectual and the 
social reactions of the pupil. The function of the 
various high school subjects is to furnish valid mate- 
rials by means of which to bring about definite degrees
-P-A-G-E-90
  76 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of development of the two aspects of mental growth, 
and to promote proper physical development. One of 
the important aspects of mental maturity is that many 
human beings virtually reach the crest of their mental 
maturity at the close of their adolescent development, 
and after that time they grow very slowly. This is 
especially important for the higher educational institu- 
tion to consider in judging the causes of slow progress 
on the part of many of the first- and second-year 
students.

  CHAPTER III 
METHOD OF LEARNING 
Point of view.—The point of view that is taken in 
this discussion is that method is only one of the more 
important principles or considerations involved in 
teaching. The meaning of the term should be limited 
and restricted so as to set it off clearly from the other 
principles. This avoids confusion and will also clarify 
the thinking about the real problem of method. The 
need for this limitation of meaning of the term method 
is seen by an examination of pedagogical books. Most 
of the present literature on the subject talks about 
“Methods of Teaching” and under the title discusses 
all the various principles of teaching as “methods.” 
Such discussions make no distinction between the 
psychological processes involved in learning and the 
devices and technique employed by the teacher. Any- 
thing and everything is designated as “method.” The 
result of such general diffuse discussions is general 
diffuse thinking about the problems of teaching; and 
because of this diffuse vagueness of thinking, when 
people attack the teaching situation to improve it, 
they invariably attack some use of device or tech- 
nique, and think, because they succeed in discovering a 
79
-P-A-G-E-94
  80 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
new device or point of technique, that they have found 
a new psychological law that insures a “cure-all” for 
the various teaching problems. Then this new device 
or point of technique is seized upon eagerly by educa- 
tional zealots and rapidly gets into practice all over the 
country. It runs its course and soon its day is past, 
for no device or point of technique can be invented that 
will meet all teaching situations or even the same 
teaching situation all the time. The ultimate result is 
a lack of confidence on the part of the general public 
and a general tendency to discredit the wisdom and 
judgment of educators in deciding what the schools 
really need and how to secure it. The public generally 
concedes that school people know what they want, but 
they are not so sure that they know what they need to 
further the progress of efficient teaching. 
There is only one way to get out of this habit of 
dealing with diffuse generalities, and that is to limit the 
meaning of method to so definite a phase of the educa- 
tive process that no one will misunderstand what is 
meant when the term is used. Then, when an attack 
is made upon method in order to improve the efficiency 
of teaching, the basis of such attack will be a clearly 
recognized defect that may have a definite remedy. 
The restriction that is held throughout this discussion 
is that the term is singular instead of plural, and that 
it relates to the performance of learning instead of to 
the performance of teaching. The definition stated 
below is in terms of such limitation of the term method.
-P-A-G-E-95
  
METHOD OF LEARNING 81 
Method defined.—Method is the mental procedure 
of the learner in mastering any form of subject-matter 
that is presented to him. This statement of method 
excludes any possibility of mistaking any device or any 
form of technique for method. The mental procedure 
of the learner is always a psychological matter, and 
attention should be centered upon what goes on in the 
mind of the learner as he deals with the subject- 
matter, when one talks about method as a problem in 
teaching. In other words, it is method of learning, 
and not “methods of teaching,” that constitutes the 
real problem of method. 
The above definition of method is still too vague and 
too general to do more than set forth the fundamental 
issue, namely, the determining of how the mind does 
proceed in learning. What, then, is the mental pro- 
cedure of the mind of the learner in mastering the 
subject-matter presented to it? The mind of the 
learner always proceeds in the following characteristic 
manner in its process of learning. First, it sees what- 
ever is presented to it as a vague whole. Second, it 
analyzes this vague whole into its essential parts or 
elements, noting the significance of each to the whole. 
Third, it discovers the dominant parts or elements, and 
reorganizes the other parts or elements around the 
dominant one. The mind now sees the thing as a 
significant or known whole instead of as the vague 
whole with which it started. Fourth, the mind repeats 
this process of analysis and synthesis until the signifi-
-P-A-G-E-96
    82 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
cance of the whole becomes habit. The learning 
process is then complete. 
This fact that the mind has not really learned a 
thing until the significance or meaning of the thing 
has become habit is an important consideration. The 
teacher too frequently stops when the learner has 
reached the end of the third step in learning the sub- 
ject-matter, namely, the process of .synthesis which 
ends with understanding or seeing a definite meaning 
for the unit or whole. This understanding or meaning 
must be rendered habit or it will be apt to be lost 
within a short time. If mere understanding or ac- 
quaintanceship with the subject-matter is all that is 
desired, then the function of the teacher is ended as 
soon as the process of synthesis is completed. If, how- 
ever, thorough mastery or control of the subject- 
matter is desired, then there must be opportunity for 
the learner to repeat the process of analysis and syn- 
thesis until it becomes habit. 
A critical point—Another point in this connection, 
which is the critical one, is the psychological fact that 
a higher order habit is built out of lower order habits, 
which are each thoroughly enough formed to function 
effectively when the formation of the higher order 
habit is demanded. Therefore, when the learner is 
struggling to fix the significance or meaning that he 
has obtained through the analysis and synthesis of the 
subject-matter presented, he should not be called upon 
to recognize this same known whole in a larger unity 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  METHOD OF LEARNIN 83 
which combines this meaning with the meanings of a 
number of other smaller wholes whose meanings may 
be only vaguely known to him. In other words, do not 
try to perfect the lower order habit by attempting to 
use it in the formation of a higher order habit. Perfect 
each of the lower order habits first, or make permanent 
the meaning of each of the smaller unities first, and 
then combine them into the larger and more complex 
unity. 
Illustrations of this mental procedure.—l. The 
learner sees an object and hears it called a “banjuke.” 
At first he sees in a vague way that it is some kind of 
musical instrument. He begins to analyze it in order 
to understand its distinguishing characteristics and the 
significance of its name. He sees that the body of the 
instrument is round like a banjo, but much smaller 
and made of wood. He also notes that the neck or 
string-board is like that of a banjo, only much smaller. 
He now notices the strings, and sees that they are like 
the strings of the ukelele. He may, if opportunity is 
afforded, strike the strings and find that the tones are 
like those of the ukelele. He now concludes that the 
meaning of the word “banjuke” is a banjo-shaped 
musical instrument with the tones of a ukelele. 
2. The learner sees a building on the campus and 
hears the name “Fowler Shops.” He begins to analyze 
the vague mass of its structure, and notes that it is a 
two-story building, rather long, with a tower at the 
entrance and a one-story shed at the other end. He
-P-A-G-E-98
  84 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
notes the many windows through which machinery can 
be seen, the character of the building-stone, and the 
character of the roof. He concludes that “Fowler 
Shops” is a long, rangy, two-story, low-roofed stone 
building, marked by a tower and used for mechanical 
arts. 
3. The learner reads the definition, “A demagogue 
is a person who panders to popular prejudice or seeks 
to inflame reasonless passions in the advancement of 
his personal interests.” He gets a general idea of the 
meaning, but does not feel sure of all the words in the 
statement. He now analyzes the statement, noting the 
meaning of such words as panders, inflame, reasonless, 
passions, etc., as used in this sentence. He thinks of 
illustrations of “popular prejudice,” “personal inter- 
ests,” and so on, until he feels sure of the exact meaning 
of all the words and their relations to one another. He 
now begins to unify or make a synthesis of these mean- 
ings, and concludes, perhaps, that a demagogue is a 
person who is neither honest nor fair in his dealings 
with the public. 
4. The learner reads the rule, “A comma should be 
used to set off a phrase or clause that is out of its 
natural position.” He may know the meanings of the 
individual words, but is in doubt as to the meaning of 
“natural position,’ “set off,” etc., as related to a 
“phrase or clause.” He proceeds to analyze these ex- 
pressions until he sees their significance. He then 
reorganizes the ideas found in the statement of the
-P-A-G-E-99
  METHOD OF LEARNING 85 
rule into the thought that the comma is used to show 
the relation of one part of a sentence to another by 
showing the order of their arrangement. 
The mental processes involved in the characteristic 
mental procedure put forth in learning.—The defini- 
tion of method thus far developed is still too general 
to be vitally applied to the problems of teaching. To 
know that the learner always first sees a thing as a 
vague whole, analyzes it into its parts, and then reor- 
ganizes or synthesizes it around its dominant element 
will be helpful in guiding the work of the teacher in the 
selection and organization of subject-matter. The 
teacher, however, must go further than this. He must 
inquire as to what mental processes go on in the mind 
of the learner that enable him to see the thing pre- 
sented as a whole, and what mental processes go on in 
making the analysis and synthesis of the thing pre- 
sented. For example, what mental processes are active 
in seeing such an object as a building as a whole? 
First of all, it is apparent that sense perception 
must be carried on vigorously in order actually to sense 
the form, the size, and the characteristic visual quali- 
ties of the materials out of which the building is con- 
structed. Memory is involved in supplying the mean- 
ings or significances that have been attached to similar 
past sensory experiences. Imagination is involved in 
supplying the parts of the building that are not imme- 
diately presented to vision. The images thus created 
are checked up by memory processes of association, 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
and judgments are formed as to their possible appro- 
priateness. Finally, reasoning takes place as the 
learner organizes his judgments to form a conclusion as 
to the meaning of the whole as vaguely seen. The 
seeing of this object, then, and becoming vaguely 
aware that it is a building of some kind, is the result of 
sense-perception, memory, imagination, judgment- 
forming, and reasoning. 
The process of analysis involves these same mental 
processes. Hence sense-perception, memory, imagina- 
tion, judgment, and reasoning may give the learner the 
number of wings in the building, the stories, the win- 
dows, the kind of entrances, etc. These same processes 
will be involved likewise in the synthesis or reunifica- 
tion of these various parts into a central meaning that 
may seem to be an appropriate one. 
One should note that at the outset of this particular 
learning performance sense-perception was the most 
active mental process involved, and that it continued in 
the foreground throughout the process of analysis. 
When, however, the learner began to unite the results 
of his sense-perception, reasoning began to be the most 
active mental process, and continued in the foreground 
until the conclusion was reached. Then the sense- 
perceived image of the object as a whole and the 
meaning or conclusion just reached balanced each 
other. The mental processes of memory, imagination, 
and judgment were involved all the way through, in 
varying degrees of intensity. These processes, how-
-P-A-G-E-101
METHOD OF LEARNING 87 
ever, were intermediary auxiliary mental elements in 
the movement of the mind as a whole. 
Take, for another example, the following stanza of 
poetry: 
The curfew tolls the knell of parting day. 
The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea; 
The plowman homeward plods his weary way, 
And leaves the world to darkness and to me. 
What are the mental processes involved in inter- 
preting this stanza? Sense-perception must give the 
learner the number of lines, the length of lines, and the 
individual words. Memory gives him the names of the 
words and their usual meanings. Imagination sug- 
gests other possible meanings for many of the words, 
and judgment decides which meanings to take. Imagi- 
nation also constructs a total image of the scene, and 
judgment decides the appropriateness of this total 
image as being adapted to the language employed by 
the writer. Reasoning gives the significance of this 
total image as the thought of the writer. Here again it 
is apparent that all of the mental processes are in- 
volved. There is a difference, however, in the degree of 
intensity with which each process is carried on. 
The process of sense-perception operates rather au- 
tomatically in giving the vague whole of the stanza 
and in furnishing the sensory identities of the indi- 
vidual words. Memory likewise performs its function 
almost automatically, since the vocabulary is that of 
familiar words. The process of imagination, however,
-P-A-G-E-102
ER are STEN ECTS rey ecpe TE Per re ge ete Re ee 
88 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
is highly active and dominant throughout the analysis 
and synthesis of the thought conveyed by the stanza. 
Judgment is also very active, and reasoning finally 
dominates the synthesis. Now, when the conclusion is 
reached, the processes of imagination and judgment 
balance over against reasoning, while sense-perception 
and memory are intermediary auxiliary processes in 
the whole movement. 
The critical point.—The critical point, then, is that 
each of the mental processes is involved in every 
learning situation and in every step of the universal 
movement of the mind, but these processes are in- 
volved with different degrees of intensity, according to 
the nature of the object presented to the learner. One of 
these processes may dominate the whole performance 
of learning in one case, and an entirely different mental 
element may dominate the learning in another case. 
Again, one process may dominate the first step in the 
fundamental movement of the mind in learning, 
another mental process may dominate the second step, 
,and still another process may dominate the third step. 
Again, these processes may be about equally balanced 
throughout the learning performance. The recognition 
of the varying degrees of intensity with which these 
mental processes should be involved in a particular 
learning situation is a critical teaching problem. There- 
fore the application of this principle to the teaching of 
the various high school subjects is of vital importance. 
Complete definition of method.—The definition of
-P-A-G-E-103
  METHOD OF LEARNING 89 
method may now be stated completely enough to be 
considered and applied definitely as a principle of 
teaching. The method of learning anything is through 
putting forth the mental processes of sense-perception, 
memory, imagination, judgment-forming, and reason- 
ing, with varying degrees of intensity according to the 
nature of the object, so that the object is first seen as a 
vague whole, is next analyzed into its characteristic 
elements, is then reorganized around its dominant ele- 
ment or elements, and this process of analysis and syn- 
thesis repeated until the significance or meaning thus 
obtained is thereafter habitually seen as a distinct or 
known whole. Armed with this definition, one can 
attack the problem of method in any teaching situa- 
tion with definite assurance, and without danger of 
confusing “method” with “device,” on the one hand, or 
with “technique” on the other hand. 
THE PROBLEM OF METHOD 
The foregoing definition of method as qualified 
through the illustrations makes very definite and spe- 
cific the fundamental issue in the problem of method. 
Using this qualified definition as a guide, the teacher 
can determine very definitely the learning procedure of 
the pupil in the study of every type and phase of 
subject-matter presented to him. Moreover, he will 
be able to judge fairly accurately the quality and effi- 
ciency of the learning performance carried on by the 
pupil at each stage of the learning process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  90 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
The first step—The psychological fact that the 
mind, in learning, always first sees a thing as a vague 
whole, then analyzes it into its fundamental parts, and 
then reorganizes these parts into a known whole, makes 
clear the first step that the teacher must take in order 
to do effective teaching. This first step is the setting 
up of a definite unity or whole for the pupil to learn. 
The first question for the teacher to answer is, just 
what is it that the pupil is to learn by means of the 
subject-matter presented to him? As soon as the 
teacher has determined definitely in his own mind just 
what the pupil is to learn, then he is ready to give 
attention to the second step in the teaching perform- 
ance. 
The second step.—After determining the exact whole 
that the pupil is to learn, the teacher is ready to decide 
the extent to which sense-perception, imagination, 
memory, judgment, and reasoning will be involved in 
seeing the particular whole clearly enough for the pupil 
to realize his learning problem. Then the teacher can 
determine the extent to which each of these mental 
processes will be involved in making the required 
analysis and the final synthesis or known whole that is 
the goal of the teaching and learning performance. As 
soon as the teacher has decided definitely in his own 
thinking the extent to which these mental processes 
will be involved in the particular learning situation, 
he is ready for the final step or consideration in con- 
nection with the problem of method.
-P-A-G-E-105
  METHOD OF LEARNING 91 
The final step.—The final step for the teacher to 
determine, in his study of the problem of method in- 
volved in any particular learning performance, is that 
of deciding upon the devices that will be most helpful 
and the technique that will be most effective in stimu- 
lating the mind of the learner to see the whole that is 
to be learned, at first vaguely, and then to carry on the 
mental processes that are most involved in the making 
of a sufficiently thorough analysis, and finally in con- 
structing the definite and well known synthesis or 
whole that is the goal of the learning performance. 
This last consideration can not be determined intelli- 
gently until the first two points have been very posi- 
tively and accurately determined. If sense-perception 
is the dominating mental process in seeing the object 
as a whole, then certain devices and certain technique 
will be more effective than the devices and technique 
that would be most effective if imagination were the 
dominating mental process. Likewise, if memory is the 
chief mental process involved in the learning situation, 
then the devices and technique will no doubt be dif- 
ferent from those that would be most effective in either 
of the other cases, etc. 
THE PROBLEM OF THE MENTAL PROCESSES 
Not only must the teacher understand the funda- 
mental movement of the mind as it is exhibited in all 
learning performances, and not only must he know the
-P-A-G-E-106
  92 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
mental processes that dominate each step of the funda- 
mental movement of the mind of the learner as he deals 
with each subject-matter whole presented to his atten- 
tion, but he must know something of the efficiency of 
each of these mental processes in the case of each pupil 
whom he is teaching. That is to say, the teacher must 
not only know the general psychological character of 
sense-perception, imagination, memory, judgment- 
forming, and reasoning, but he must know how effi- 
ciently each pupil can sense-perceive, imagine, remem- 
ber, judge, and reason in connection with different 
types and phases of subject-matter. These are the 
specific human elements that form the real crux of 
every teaching situation, and they present a very 
difficult as well as a very concrete problem for the 
teacher. This is one aspect of the human element, 
with which the teacher has to deal constantly, that 
can be studied and mastered thoroughly in a training- 
school or even in the public school through systematic 
directed observation. Skill in recognizing the charac- 
ter and qualities of these mental processes, as mani- 
fested in the learning performances of individual 
pupils, can be acquired only through long study and 
extended practice. The value, however, to the teacher 
of paying the price of acquiring a high degree of skill 
in dealing with these particular human elements is 
perfectly obvious. 
Sense-perception.—The first practical problem that 
confronts the teacher in regard to the sensory processes
-P-A-G-E-107
  
METHOD OF LEARNING 93 
of his individual pupils is that of the general acuity of 
the sense-organs. The sensory processes of vision and 
audition are especially vital in the learning of most 
types of subject-matter. Defective vision and defec- 
tive audition are prevalent to a rather high degree 
among secondary school pupils. This fact, as shown 
by carefully made scientific studies of the problems of 
school hygiene, serves to make very emphatic the 
necessity for knowing the status of each pupil in regard 
to these fundamental sensory processes. If sense- 
perception of the visual or auditory type is intensively 
involved in a particular learning situation, and the 
pupil suffers a defect of vision or of audition, he is 
seriously handicapped in his attempt to deal with the 
learning situation. If the teacher does not know the 
degree of the pupil’s sensory defect, he will not under- 
stand why the pupil does not succeed in mastering the 
situation to a satisfactory degree. He may charge the 
pupil with indifference, lack of training, or lack of 
ability to learn, and fail absolutely to discover the real 
cause of the pupil’s inefficiency. If the defect is known, 
the teacher can seek to find some way to have it cor- 
rected, or to find some means of offsetting the defect in 
connection with the particular situation. If nothing 
can be done to relieve the difficulty, the teacher can at 
least encourage the pupil to do the best he can in spite 
of the defect, and he will not make the mistake of 
criticizing and censuring the pupil for something for 
which the pupil is not responsible. 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  94 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
Sensory habits important—The second practical 
problem that the teacher must deal with in this con- 
nection is that of the sensory habits of individual 
pupils. The pupil may have fairly good sensory acuity 
and yet be inefficient in his learning because of faulty 
habits of practice in employing his sensory processes, or 
because of the lack of habits of sensory practice. For 
example, the pupil may have very good vision, but he 
may not have formed the habit of employing vision 
accurately and actively in observing the important 
visual characteristics of things that are presented to 
his attention. Therefore, if the particular learning sit- 
uation demands a certain degree of efficiency in the 
practice of visualizing, and the pupil does not possess 
the necessary skill, it may be necessary for the pupil to 
take special drills in the sensory practice of visualiza- 
tion in order to bring his skill up to a point of effi- 
ciency that can be capitalized in valid learning situa- 
tions. The teacher should have definite means of 
testing the pupil’s habits of sensory practice in order 
that he may determine the effectiveness of the pupil’s 
learning performance at each stage of the fundamental 
movement in learning. Such tests will enable the 
teacher to know where and why the learning perform- 
ance breaks down in cases where the sensory processes 
are the dominant ones. Knowing the sensory habit 
that is defective and knowing the degree of the defect, 
the teacher can interpose training to overcome the 
defect and to remove the handicap that must otherwise
-P-A-G-E-109
  METHOD OF LEARNING 95 
prove very detrimental to the pupil in his development. 
Sense-training.—The foregoing discussion raises the 
question as to whether or not many high school pupils 
may need special sensory training. High school pupils 
undoubtedly need efficient habits of sensory practice. 
The question is, whether these habits can be developed 
best through definite drills that are devised especially 
for the sake of developing a satisfactory degree of skill 
that can be capitalized automatically in many valid 
learning situations, or whether these sensory habits can 
be developed best through the learning situations that 
demand the employment of such sensory habits in 
order for the learning to be economically and effec- 
tively accomplished. The psychology of habit forma- 
tion seems to favor the taking time off for definite drills 
that are adapted to securing the maximum of efficiency 
in the minimum of time. The opportunities, however, 
that are afforded by learning situations for emphasiz- 
ing and perfecting the skill in the employment of sen- 
sory habits ought not to be neglected. The use of 
both kinds of practice opportunities will no doubt 
secure the best results. The main point is that the 
teacher must recognize the need for such sensory 
training, and take active steps toward securing skill in 
habits of sensory practices as rapidly as possible in the 
development of his individual pupils. 
Imagination.—The mental process of imagination is 
involved to a much greater degree than most high 
school teachers realize in the learning of almost every 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  96 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
type and phase of subject-matter. Even the situations 
that seem to be most concrete and to involve sense- 
perception to a very high degree very often involve the 
employment of a rather high degree of imagination. 
This fact presents a real problem to the teacher. The 
pupil may be lacking in the power to employ imagina- 
tion effectively in the particular learning situation, or 
he may either have faulty habits of imagination or lack 
the habit of facile and accurate imagining. In either 
case, the pupil will be seriously handicapped in his 
attempts to learn. The teacher must know, in the 
first place, just how important the process of imagina- 
tion is in the particular learning situation, and second 
he must know both the ability of the pupil to employ 
imagination and his habits of employing this mental 
process in his learning. Then, third, the teacher must 
know the possibility of developing a satisfactory skill 
in the pupil’s imaginative practices. This means that 
the teacher must study each pupil intensively in order 
to develop his power and skill in imagination up to the 
point where it will be capitalized automatically in 
valid learning situations. 
The point before stated, that imagination is involved 
to a much greater degree in even the most concrete 
cases than most teachers realize, may be made more 
emphatic by means of one or two typical illustrations 
of such concrete situations. Take, for example, the 
study of the heart in physiology. The use of an actual 
heart of, say, a beef, that is dissected before the class
-P-A-G-E-111
  METHOD OF LEARNING 97 
by the teacher or that may be dissected by the pupils 
themselves, working individually or in pairs as the 
case may be, seems to present a very concrete situation 
and one that involves sense-perception to a very high 
degree. The process of sense-perception is intensively 
involved in acquiring accurate ideas of the external 
appearance of the organ, its size, and shape. As the 
dissecting proceeds, sense-perception is highly involved 
at every stage in acquiring accurate ideas of the parts 
as they are gradually disclosed. The understanding of 
the heart as a whole, and the relation of each part to 
every other part, can not be acquired by the process of 
sense-perception. The images of the parts must be 
constructed into a total image such as can not be 
sense-perceived, for not all of the parts can be sense- 
perceived simultaneously. When the dissection is com- 
pleted, the heart can not be reassembled physically, 
but the pupil must be able to imagine each part in its 
proper relation to each of the other parts and to the 
organ as a whole, in order really to understand the 
significance of each of the individual sensory experi- 
ences that has been brought to his mind through the 
process of sense-perception. The idea of the heart 
that he finally has, when he truly understands it as a 
specific organ performing a definite function in the 
human body, is not made up of the materials with 
which sense-perception has dealt during his study of 
the actual organ. The final idea of heart that he has is 
made up of the constructive images that signify to his
-P-A-G-E-112
  98 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
mind the relation of part to part, part to whole, and 
whole to part. He can now image the auricles, the 
valves, etc., as vividly as abstract significances, as he 
was able to image them as sense-perceived experiences 
during the first stages of the learning performance. 
A careful study of the foregoing example discloses 
the fact that the process of imagination was just as 
vitally and just as intensively involved all the way 
through the process of dissection as was the process of 
sense-perception. As each part was dissected and 
taken away from the organ, the learner could not see 
the next part thus disclosed in its relation to the part 
just taken away, except as he had the power to con- 
struct a clear and accurate image of the part that had 
just been removed and to hold it in its proper relation 
to the part being sense-perceived at that moment. 
This is a very important point. The teacher who fails 
to recognize the intensive demand made upon the pupil 
for the practice of vivid and accurate imagination in 
these so-called concrete cases is not apt to test the 
process of imagination and to make sure that the pupil 
is constructing the right kind of a mental product as 
the result of the concrete presentation of material. 
Moreover, he will not understand why the pupil often 
fails to profit by the so-called concrete study of the 
subject-matter, and he will not be taking steps to rem- 
edy the inefficiencies in imagination that were the basis 
of the failures. 
The study of plants in botany, the study of animals
-P-A-G-E-113
  METHOD OF LEARNING 99 
in zodlogy, and the study of mechanical phenomena in 
physics, the study of chemical reactions in chemistry, 
ete., all involve the employment of vivid and accurate 
imagination to a very great degree. In fact, all expe- 
rience-getting material involves imagination just as 
much as it involves the process of sense-perception. In 
other words, concrete materials are of no value except 
as they become the basis for the construction of mental 
unities through the power of imagination. The mind, 
in building its fabric of mental content, must be freed 
from the individual experiences gained through sense- 
perception in order to construct the universal elements 
of ideas and thoughts. This psychological truth is of 
vital importance to the teacher. The goal of teaching 
is not the so-called concrete experiences, but it is the 
universal significances of experiences. Therefore the 
learning performance is never really completed until 
the pupil is able to image the universal mental sig- 
nificance that lies behind the immediate experiences 
that are presented to his senses. 
One of the best tests of this fact is the kind of 
drawing the pupil will make if called upon to demon- 
strate his understanding of such an organ as the human 
heart. If he has not got beyond the concreteness of 
his sense-perceptions, he will draw a representation of 
the particular heart with which he worked during the 
study. On the other hand, if he has got to the uni- 
versal significance of his sense-perceptions gained 
during the concrete study, he will draw a representation 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  100 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of the heart as an abstract entity. That is to say, he 
may draw it on a much larger or a much smaller scale 
than the actual heart that was dissected during the 
study, but he will have a correct representation of the 
relations of the different parts that are absolutely 
necessary to perform the definite function of that 
organ. He represents the universal significance of each 
part of the organ as he sees it through the power of 
imagination. 
The process of imagination is not only greatly in- 
volved in the so-called concrete situations suggested 
above, but it is also highly involved in the interpreta- 
tion of all kinds of printed material. Accurate images 
of meanings appropriate to the language employed in 
the statement of facts and truths in every high school 
subject are of the most vital importance. The most 
matter-of-fact statement is meaningless without the 
construction of accurate images appropriate to its 
interpretation. Hence every teacher should study the 
relation of imagination to every learning situation, and 
check up the ability of every pupil to employ imagina- 
tion effectively, and also to test his habits of practising 
the power of imagination that he does possess. Imag- 
ination is one of the human elements with which the 
teacher must deal constantly, and it is an element that 
can not be thoroughly understood without very careful 
study and considerable practice in dealing with it. 
Memory.—The mental process of memory is so 
necessary in the learning of any type and phase of
-P-A-G-E-115
  
METHOD OF LEARNING 101 
subject-matter that the teacher needs to give much 
attention to the power possessed by each pupil to 
memorize, temporarily or permanently, the detailed 
facts that are involved in each whole presented for 
study. The habits of memorizing practised by the 
pupil have so much to do with the efficiency of his 
performance that it is almost impossible to determine 
the native quality of his memory ability without testing 
thoroughly his memory habits. First of all, the teacher 
needs to know the kind or kinds of bonds that must be 
set up in the mind of the pupil for effective memoriz- 
ing of the particular body of material under considera- 
tion. Then he needs to know how each pupil goes 
about attempting to set up these bonds, and last of 
all he needs to know what are the most effective means 
of setting up these bonds in the mind of each particular 
pupil. 
One important problem that the teacher must keep 
clearly in mind is that of determining the relation of 
memory to the carrying on of the fundamental move- 
ment of the mind in learning a particular unity or 
whole that is set up as the goal of learning. The 
teacher needs to know what materials must be supplied 
by memory in order that the pupil may see the object 
as a whole. He also needs to know what materials 
must be supplied by memory in order that the pupil 
may carry on the process of analysis in a thorough- 
going and efficient manner. Likewise, he must know 
what materials are needed in making the reorganization
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
or synthesis of the elements developed by analysis so 
as to give the pupil a clearly known whole at the 
close of his learning performance. The teacher who 
does not know the relation of memory to each step of 
the learning performance, and who does not know the 
status of each pupil’s power and habits of memorizing, 
will be unable to employ the best devices and to 
practise the best technique in stimulating the mind of 
the learner to put forth its maximum effort in learning. 
Moreover, he will not be able to take constructive steps 
toward improving the memory habits of his pupils, for 
he will not know when and where the learning per- 
formance has broken down because of feeble memory 
power or ineffective memory habits. 
Judgment-forming.—The making of valid, accurate 
judgments is involved to some degree in every type of 
learning situation. The problem for the teacher is that 
of first determining the extent to which the forming 
of judgments is involved in the particular learning 
situation, and second of discovering the habits and 
facility with which each pupil makes judgments. If 
the teacher knows rather definitely these two things, 
he can determine fairly accurately the point at which 
the learning process in the case of any pupil breaks 
down on account of the failure of the pupil to employ 
judgment intensively and validly. 
The teacher not only needs to know the extent to 
which judgment is involved in any particular learning 
situation and to know the habits and facility of the
-P-A-G-E-117
  METHOD OF LEARNING 103 
pupils in making judgments, but he also needs to know 
the specific character of the judgments demanded by 
the situation. That is to say, he needs to know 
whether the judgments are chiefly simple, spontaneous 
judgments dealing with concrete identities, or whether 
they are largely complex, abstract identities upon 
which judgments must be passed. Knowing the char- 
acter of the judgments required by the problem that 
the pupil faces, the teacher can make the best selection 
of devices and can adapt his technique to the securing 
of the best results from his teaching. 
Reasoning.—The mental process of reasoning or re- 
flective thinking is involved to some extent in every 
learning performance, but the range of intensity with 
which it is involved varies greatly, according to the 
types and phases of subject-matter in the different 
high school subjects. It is highly important for the 
teacher to know just to what extent reasoning is de- 
manded by the particular learning situation; but the 
most important point, perhaps, is that of knowing the 
habits and the efficiency of each pupil in carrying on 
reflective thinking in dealing with each particular type 
and phase of subject-matter that is employed in his 
education. The pupil may have good mental endow- 
ment, but be lacking in effective habits of reasoning. 
One of the aspects of growth and development of the 
pupil, from the standpoint of his mental behavior, is 
that of acquiring accurate and efficient habits of reflec- 
tive thinking. Therefore the teacher needs to become
-P-A-G-E-118
MERE REM OL MEN Se Ae CTI en CONE POL ay Ter gk SERS Ea aa 
104 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
thoroughly acquainted with the exhibitions of this 
particular type of human material, and to have definite 
and valid means at his command of measuring the 
intensiveness and the effectiveness with which the 
pupil reflects upon the data presented to him as he 
carries on the fundamental procedure of seeing the 
vague whole, of breaking it up into its essential parts, 
and of reorganizing these essential elements into the 
ultimate synthesis that is the goal of the particular 
learning situation. 
Other human elements.—The teacher needs to know 
not only the specific mental processes involved in 
carrying on the fundamental movement of the mind 
in learning, and each pupil’s ability and habits in 
employing these mental processes, but he also needs to 
know each pupil’s general ability and habits of atten- 
tion, concentration, and will. Every effort that the 
pupil puts forth in attempting to deal with any learn- 
ing situation is conditioned by his ability to attend to 
the problem in hand and to concentrate his mental 
processes and his mental content upon the solution of 
the problem. His power of concentrated attention is 
largely dependent upon his ability and his habits of 
voluntary control. And the pupil’s voluntary control 
is determined by the character and habits of his will. 
Improvement in respect to these general phases of 
mental behavior is part of the education of the pupil; 
hence the teacher must study the interrelations exist- 
ing between these general aspects of mental activity  
-P-A-G-E-119
METHOD OF LEARNING 105 
and the more specific mental processes of sense-percep- 
tion, imagination, memory, judgment, and reasoning 
as they are all brought into play in carrying on the 
fundamental procedure of learning. The teacher 
should test these general phases of the pupil’s learning 
efficiency, and determine as accurately as possible the 
part they play in insuring success or in causing failure 
at any particular point in the learning performance of 
the individual pupil. 
SUMMARY 
Method is only one of the principles of teaching, and 
its meaning should be set off clearly from the other 
principles. This may be accomplished by defining 
method as the mental procedure of the learner in 
mastering any form of subject-matter presented to his 
mind. This mental procedure is characterized by four 
steps: namely, seeing the thing as a vague synthesis; 
analyzing it into its parts; reorganizing it around its 
dominant part; reiteration of this process until it 
becomes habit. Learning is not complete until the 
stage of habit is reached. Higher order habits are 
formed by combining lower order habits; hence the 
lower order habits should be thoroughly formed before 
the demand is made for the exercise of the higher order 
habit. The general movement of the mind in learning 
is made possible only by the carrying on of the mental 
processes of sense-perception, memory, imagination, 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
judgment-forming, and reasoning. These processes are 
involved in every learning situation, but they are not 
employed with the same degree of intensity in learning 
different types of subject-matter. The intensity with 
which these different mental processes are carried on 
also varies with the different steps in the general move- 
ment of the mind as it learns different types of subject- 
matter. 
The problem of method involves the setting up of a 
definite unity or whole to be learned, the determination 
of the extent to which the mental processes of sense- 
perception, imagination, memory, judgment, and rea- 
soning are demanded in learning the whole, and the 
determination of the devices and technique best 
adapted to stimulating these mental processes in the 
mind of the learner. The mental processes present not 
only the problem of determining the extent to which 
each is involved in any particular learning situation, 
but they also present the problem of discovering the 
ability and the habits of each pupil in the carrying on 
of each of these fundamental processes. The teacher 
needs to know not only the status of each pupil in 
regard to each of these mental processes, but he needs 
also to know the status of each pupil with respect to 
his general efficiency of attention, concentration, and 
voluntary control. If the teacher is thoroughly ac- 
quainted with these various human elements with 
which he has to deal constantly in teaching, he will be 
able to determine accurately and definitely the reasons
-P-A-G-E-121

why the pupil fails in his learning and to locate the

CHAPTER IV 
THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 
  Motivation defined.—The term motivation is herein 
used to mean the stimulation of a desire upon the part 
of the learner to master the subject-matter presented. 
School work is motivated when the pupil is impelled 
or moved by a definite choice to master the work. 
This use of the term lies outside of the consideration 
of what values may be employed to induce the desire. 
In other words, it does not matter what it is that 
impels the effort to learn, but it is the fact that the 
learner does purpose definitely to master the subject- 
matter that constitutes real motivation. Motivation, 
then, is simply moving power that insures vigorous 
effort to learn. 
The problem.—The real problem in attempting to 
motivate school work is that of discovering the value 
or values that will appeal strongly enough to stimulate 
the pupil to effective effort. The nature of the adoles- 
cent boy or girl is such that a number of values must 
be employed in order to secure real motivation of their 
school work. The value that appeals strongly to one 
individual may have little or no appeal for another 
individual. Moreover, the value that appeals strongly 
109
-P-A-G-E-124
  110 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
to an individual at one time may not appeal strongly 
at another time. The differences in appeal among 
different individuals and the fluctuation ot appeals for 
the same individual greatly complicate the problem. 
The teacher must be continually on the alert to catch 
these differences and fluctuations. 
The appeal of interest—One of the appeals that has 
been employed in effective motivation is that of in- 
terest. The pupil works vigorously at the thing that 
is of interest to him. The term interest is used here 
to mean the attraction that a piece of subject-matter 
may have for the learner in and of itself. The pupil 
who is interested to the degree of intellectual fascina- 
tion always becomes a good student in the subject. 
For example, the solving of algebra problems may be 
interesting as a form of intellectual activity. The 
unfolding of a solution step by step may be very fas- 
cinating; hence the learner may work faithfully to 
solve his problems simply as an enjoyable intellectual 
pastime. The difficulty lies in the fact that algebra 
does not have such a fascination for all pupils. There- 
fore many pupils must be moved by some other value 
than intellectual enjoyment if they are to be induced 
to put forth effective efforts to master the subject- 
matter of algebra. 
The critical point in regard to interest as a means 
of motivation is that no straining effort should be put 
forth to secure interest in a particular subject. In- 
terest, to be effective, must be natural and must exist
-P-A-G-E-125
  
THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 111 
because of the character of the individual’s mental 
make-up and the nature of the subject presented. The 
so-called “acquired interest” or “mediated interest,” 
as it is sometimes called, is in reality another form 
of motivation. The impelling power is not the intel- 
lectual fascination that the thing has, but rather it is 
the recognition on the part of the learner of the con- 
nection that the mastery of the subject has with some- 
thing that he desires to secure. Such a form of moti- 
vation is a very vital and effective one, but it should 
not be confused with the spontaneous form of interest. 
The natural intellectual curiosity of the adolescent 
pupil will be one of the chief sources of motivating his 
work. The coming in contact with new experiences, 
the comprehension of new facts, and the acquisition of 
new perspectives that throw the every-day world into 
new mental reliefs will claim and absorb the energies 
of the adolescent pupil, if he is brought into contact 
with these new materials in the right kind of a setting 
and under the right kind of learning conditions. The 
human mind must have food materials upon which to 
feed and grow. This necessity of the mind for food 
will operate as a-strong motive power, however, only 
when the mental foods are made palatable and satis- 
fying. That is to say, curiosity will be impelling only 
when the pupil faces new subject-matter materials that 
are brought to him in such a way as to arouse his 
mental appetite. As soon as the keen edge of his 
intellectual appetite is blunted by satiation, the food 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  112 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
materials must be changed. If he is compelled to go 
on eating the intellectual pabulum that has become 
stale, curiosity no longer impels him and the motive 
power from that source is lost. This is one of the 
reasons why the high school subjects should be made 
experience-getting opportunities in the highest possible 
degree. Experience-getting arouses curiosity, and curi- 
osity impels one to put forth vigorous effort to discover 
truth. 
The appeal of usability—One of the most powerful 
appeals that can be made to the adolescent boy or girl 
is the appeal of the usability of the subject-matter 
studied. One of the remarks that is most commonly 
made by the high school pupil is, “I don’t see any use 
in studying history, Latin,” etc., as the case may be. 
The boy who expects to be a dentist can see the value 
that a knowledge of chemistry may have for that pro- 
fession. The girl who plans to be a nurse can see the 
value that a knowledge of physiology and hygiene may 
have for that profession. The prospective mechanic 
can see the value of physics as an aid to mastering 
mechanical problems. 
The difficulty lies in the fact that very few adoles- 
cent boys and girls really know what fields they will 
enter as a life work. Hence the attempt to motivate 
the work in the high school subjects through recog- 
nition of the usability of the subject-matter in some 
particular field is a complicated undertaking. The 
teacher should, however, set forth as definitely as pos- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Va THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 113 
sible the various ways in which the subject-matter in a 
particular subject is valuable from the standpoint of 
usability. Then, as the purposes of the pupil fluctuate, 
the appeal of usability may be effective during what- 
ever periods of time the pupil holds to a definite pur- 
pose that the mastery of the subject may further. 
Vocational guidance.—One of the questions that 
confronts the modern high school is that of the extent 
to which it, as an institution, should undertake to 
determine the vocational future of its pupils. The 
very nature of the secondary period of human develop- 
ment renders the problem of choosing a vocation an 
extremely difficult one for the majority of the ado- 
lJescent boys and girls. Very few individuals at the 
adolescent age possess such marked talent in one line 
or have such an intense desire in one direction that 
they can choose, with any degree of certainty, the work 
for which they may be best adapted or the work in 
which they will ultimately find the greatest satisfac- 
tion. Adolescent boys and girls face the necessity of 
discovering themselves before they are in a position 
to determine the vocational roads that they may travel 
with any degree of assurance. Therefore an attempt 
to induce an early choice of a vocation and to select 
those high school subjects that are best adapted to 
preparing the pupil for the particular vocation chosen 
is a hazardous venture. 
The high school is responsible, however, for giving as 
much accurate information as possible concerning the 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  114 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
various vocations that may be chosen by the high 
school pupils later in their lives, and ample oppor- 
tunities for participating in vocational activities as a 
means of making intelligent choices should be afforded. 
When a pupil expresses a choice, he should have the 
information furnished him that will enable him to 
know accurately the road of training he must travel in 
order to succeed in the chosen vocation. He should 
also know something of the economic possibilities of 
the chosen vocation. This should include information 
as to the supply and demand of workers in the chosen 
field, the possible compensation, and the living stand- 
ards that are involved in making good in the particular 
vocation. Such information will enable the pupil to 
have a fairly intelligent perspective upon which to 
base his judgment in deciding as to the desirability 
and the advisability of selecting the particular field for 
his life work. Such vocational guidance as this will 
not lead to disastrous results. 
The appeal of personal development.—Another ap- 
peal that may be made strong with many pupils is the 
appeal of the value of the subject as a means of 
bringing about definite personal development. The 
pupil may be made to feel the need of intellectual 
growth and to desire to attain such growth. He may 
realize that he lacks power to think or to interpret long, 
complex sentences. The value of studying foreign 
language and of mastering the analysis of the literature 
of his own native language may be readily recognized
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 115 
as the most effective means by which to develop power 
of interpretation. Then again, the pupil may value 
the subject as a mark of personal attainment. For 
example, the pupil may study French, Spanish, music, 
science, or almost any subject in the curriculum just 
to feel intellectually superior to those who have never 
studied such subjects. This may not be a very com- 
mendable type of appeal; and yet, the desire to dispel 
ignorance and to attain some degree of intellectual 
refinement is certainly worth while. In other words, 
the desire to be educated is worthy of being stimulated 
and employed as a means of motivating school work. 
The appeal of social standing.—Another appeal that 
is closely related to the appeal of personal development 
is that of social standing or prestige. Many pupils 
desire to graduate from high school because they feel 
the pressure of social standing. They do not really 
know what they may do with an education, but they 
know that being a high school graduate is regarded as a — 
badge of respectability. Then, too, they know that a 
high school diploma is a passport to social opportunities 
in higher educational institutions. They likewise know 
that their opportunities for meeting members of the 
opposite sex who might be socially desirable, and of ul- 
timately selecting mates, are greatly increased through 
graduating from the high school. 
The desire to graduate leads to the desire to secure 
credits in the subjects studied. Therefore the desire 
to obtain credit in the course may be the means of 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  116 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
securing motivation. Then, too, the pupil may not 
only desire to earn the credit, but he may also desire 
to make a good grade. The social appeal of rivalry 
and leadership may be strong and impel vigorous, effec- 
tive effort to master the subjects studied. This form 
of motivation may be more or less unconscious in the 
mind of the pupil, but the teacher may be able subtly 
to stimulate it to effective reaction. One pupil may 
strive hard to make as high a grade or a higher one 
than some other pupil whom he regards as his inferior. 
Again, the desire to stand at the head of the group 
may stimulate the pupil to vigorous effort. 
Another form of social appeal is that of the desire 
to go with the crowd. Many an adolescent boy or girl 
has gone to high school because his or her fellows were 
going. Very often the pupil takes certain elective 
courses because his friends are taking these courses. 
The desire to stay with the group may be strong enough 
to be a real means of securing effective motivation of 
the school work, for the instinct to “belong” is very 
impelling in most human beings. 
The complexity of the problem.—The problem of 
the motivation of the high school subjects is greatly 
complicated by the psychological tendencies of adoles- 
cents. The vacillation of purposes has already been 
mentioned in the above discussion. This trait, how- 
ever, needs special consideration because of the diffi- 
culty that it injects into the situation. The psycho- 
logical explanation of this tendency on the part of
-P-A-G-E-131
  THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 117 
adolescent boys and girls to be absolutely unreliable 
in their purposes lies in the fact that their intellectual 
and physical powers are so largely undeveloped that 
they do not know what they really can do with any 
degree of success. As they work at this or that line 
of work and discover that they have ability in this or 
that field, or find that they have little ability in this 
or that particular line, their ideas change as to the 
desirability of specializing in the particular field. 
Another explanation of this tendency to vacillate in 
purpose is the fact that the goal set up is so far away 
that a glimpse of the road over which the youth must 
travel is enough to turn him from his purpose or to 
cause him to work only half-heartedly toward its 
achievement. The lack of proper information may 
have led to the setting up of his purpose in the first 
place. Then, when he is adequately informed as to 
the requirements for attaining his purpose, he feels 
that he is not willing to pay the price. 
A still further explanation of this trait is the fact 
that strong physiological and social impulses and in- 
stincts rise with impelling force during the period of 
adolescence. These forces are largely uncontrolled at 
first, and the very struggle to regulate them and to 
build them into reliable forms of behavior greatly dis- 
turbs the individual’s mental and emotional balance. 
Therefore he is a prey to passing whims and fancies, 
and finds it difficult to follow any appeal for any great 
length of time.

The influence of mental health.—Another factor 
that has a great influence upon the problem of motiva- 
tion is the mental health of the pupil. The adolescent 
period is one of great mental struggle. The mental 
poise of the individual is easily disturbed. The most 
trivial things very often bring tragic consequences into 
the conduct of the adolescent. Morbid fears and vari- 
ous kinds of mental apprehensions prey upon the mind 
of youth. Social conditions in the home, at school, and 
outside of home and school may be a constant source 
- of disquieting influence. The earlier experiences of 
the individual may have been of such a character as to 
leave him with a variety of subconscious mental com- 
plexes that are readily stimulated and rendered all- 
powerful in influencing his behavior, although they 
may never come into his active field of attention. 
Other phases of mental health might be cited, but the 
purpose of this discussion is merely to call attention 
to the psychology of mental health as related to the 
problem of motivation. 
The important point is that the adequate motivation 
of school subjects may be largely defeated by the fac- 
tors of mental health. The pupil who is a prey to 
morbid fears may shrink from the taking of certain 
courses because he feels powerless to deal with the 
difficulties that loom up in his mind. Again, the pupil 
may have a strong aversion to certain types of subject- 
matter without being able to explain the source of his 
dislike for these particular things. A subconscious
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE MOTIVATION OF LEARNING 119 
mental state that may even be undiscoverable by the 
most acute observer may be the bar to proper motiva- 
tion of the material. Very often, no doubt, the state 
of mental health must be looked after before the indi- 
vidual is in a fit condition to be reached by any of the 
legitimate appeals of worth-while values. 
The above fact demands that teachers, supervisors, 
and administrators become thoroughly acquainted with 
the facts of adolescent psychology as they are exhibited 
in the actual behavior of the adolescent boy and girl. 
The idea is not that every educational worker shall 
become a mental physician, but that each and every 
individual who is responsible for the guidance of the 
pupil during his secondary period of development shall 
be able to discover the fact that this or that pupil is 
suffering from mental ill health. Then the graver 
cases should be referred to a competent physician who 
is qualified to treat the various mental conditions in- 
cident to adolescent development. 
The influence of physical health_—The pupil who is 
suffering from a physical handicap of any sort will be 
hard to reach with any form of appeal. The keen edge 
of ambition is quickly dulled by eye-strain, dull hear- 
ing, obstructed breathing, weak circulation, malnutri- 
tion, defective teeth, etc. The person who feels the 
drag of physical deficiencies soon loses the mental per- 
spective that is necessary to the adequate motivation 
of his work. The road ahead seems doubly long when 
one’s vitality is low or the sense-organs weak and
-P-A-G-E-134
  120 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
defective. Then, too, physical health is always related 
to mental health, so that the one reacts upon the other 
and greatly complicates the problem of motivation. 
SUMMARY 
Motivation is the moving power that insures satis- 
factory effort upon the part of the learner in mastering 
subject-matter. The problem is to secure values that 
will appeal to adolescents for long enough time to 
awaken the desired effort. Interest is one form of 
motivation that is effective. The appeal of usability 
is always strong when it is genuine. Other appeals are 
personal development, social standing, and desire to 
go with the crowd. The problem of motivation is 
greatly complicated by the unstable mental charac- 
teristics of the adolescent pupil. The mental health 
of the pupil also seriously affects the problem of moti- 
vation, and the general conditions of physical health 
likewise influence the situation.

CHAPTER V 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 
Differences in training.—The range of differences in 
training in any high school class is usually much greater 
than teachers realize. The pupils in a freshman class, 
for example, may all have passed through the same 
elementary school and may have reached high school 
at practically the same age. Nevertheless they are not 
of equal training. In the first place, they come from 
home conditions that are widely different in the oppor- 
tunities that they offer for experiences and training 
that are truly educative. One pupil may come from 
a home that is a luxurious mansion artistically designed 
and decorated, handsomely furnished, and supplied 
with books, magazines, beautiful pictures, and musical 
instruments. This individual has opportunity to read, 
to hear fine music, and to learn much through spon- 
taneous experiences. He hears refined language, dis- 
cussions of important life problems, and learns genteel 
manners that give him poise and a dignity of bearing. 
Another pupil of this same group comes from a home 
that is very humble and almost wholly lacking in books, 
music, and other opportunities for spontaneous educa- 
tion. He hears crude language and little or no dis- 
123
-P-A-G-E-138
  124 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
cussion of vital problems other than the primary ones 
of food and clothing. This individual spends hours 
in monotonous routine tasks that have long since 
ceased to interest or to educate him. Then there is 
the pupil who comes from the home that is neither 
luxurious nor poverty-stricken. This individual has, 
perhaps, a moderate opportunity to read, study music, 
enjoy good pictures, and in general to take on more or 
less of education spontaneously. He hears practical 
discussions of important problems in language that is 
simple and yet for the most part correct. He more 
than likely has some opportunity to work with tools 
and to make things on his own initiative. 
Not only the home life of these pupils is greatly 
different, but their contact with the world outside of 
home and school is very different. One pupil may 
attend a church of magnificent grandeur. He hears 
instructive and inspiring sermons and feels the mag- 
netic influence of a highly educated minister; another 
pupil attends a very humble church where he hears 
only the very earnest yet often ignorant exhortations 
of an uneducated preacher; while still another pupil 
does not attend any church and feels no refining influ- 
ences of religious surroundings and services. Again, 
one pupil may go to hear many instructive lectures, 
may see good plays, may hear grand operas, etc.; while 
another pupil may be wholly deprived of such edu- 
cative opportunities. Furthermore, one pupil may 
have traveled a great deal and may have come into
-P-A-G-E-139
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 125 
interesting contact with different kinds of people, 
industrial plants and activities, social and economic 
conditions in large cities, wide stretches of rural 
districts in different physiographic regions. He may 
have attended large public gatherings, witnessed great 
celebrations, and may have been a spectator at some 
spectacular historical event. Another pupil in this 
same class may never have traveled outside of his own 
county. He has seen only the usual conditions and 
events of commonplace life. 
The foregoing discussion has pointed out some of 
the factors that may account for a wide range of 
difference in the training in the members of a strictly 
freshman group. These same facts hold for the mem- 
bers of a strictly sophomore or strictly junior or strictly 
senior group. But not all high school classes are made 
up of just freshmen, or just sophomores, or just juniors, 
or just seniors. Many of the elective courses must 
necessarily be open to pupils of at least two of such 
class groups, and very often such courses must include 
individuals from three or even all of the class groups 
of the high school. This fact means that many high 
school classes must have and do contain pupils who 
have wide differences in the amount of high school 
training itself, as well as wide differences on account of 
the factors set forth above. One or two examples will 
make the significance of this point clear. 
Take a foreign language course, for example, begin- 
ning Latin. Here may be found pupils from all of the
-P-A-G-E-140
  126 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
class groups. This may be the first course in a foreign 
language for each member of the class; hence they may 
seem to have the same preparation for mastering the 
new language. This is not the fact, however, for there 
is as much as three years of difference in the amount 
of training that these pupils have had in dealing with 
their native language. If the teaching of English has 
been anything like what it should be, the senior is three 
years ahead of the freshman in the mastery of the 
fundamental language concepts which are common to 
all languages. He knows more grammar, should be a 
better speller, and can grasp a more complex group of 
ideas than can the freshman. On the other hand, he 
may not memorize vocabulary as readily as some under- 
classman gifted with a verbal memory. 
Take history, for another example. Here again may 
be found at least two to three grades of class groups 
represented. The course may be open to sophomores 
and juniors, or to juniors and seniors, or possibly to 
pupils of all three class groups. This means that some 
members of the class will be taking their first course 
in history in the high school, while others will be 
taking their second and third courses in high school 
history. The differences in history training alone must 
therefore necessarily be great, to say nothing of the 
differences due to the other factors of training both in 
and out of school. 
What is true of foreign language and history is also 
true of many of the courses in science. Elective 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 127 
courses can not avoid this range of membership, no 
matter how well the program of classes has been 
planned. This range of differences in school training 
is not restricted to the elective courses. The required 
courses also are subject to more or less of the same 
range in membership. The sophomore class in English, 
for example, may contain juniors and even a sub-senior. 
This condition is due to the fact that frequently a 
pupil fails in English while at the same time he gets 
along well in other courses. Presently he finds himself 
a junior or possibly a sub-senior in rank, and yet in the 
sophomore or second course in English. This type of 
pupil is now far ahead of the ordinary sophomore in 
general training. This means, too, that he has had 
much practice, as far as school work goes, in inter- 
preting and writing the English language. Other re- 
quired courses meet these same differences in grade 
rank in their membership. 
The fact that every high school class is made up of 
individuals who possess wide differences in their train- 
ing presents a very real and vital problem. The prac- 
tical factors in each case must be faced and the devices 
and technique employed must be adapted to sur- 
mounting the difficulties involved in each situation. 
Differences in rate of learning.—High school pupils 
not only come into their various classes with widely 
different backgrounds of experience and training, but 
they also come with a wide range of differences in the 
rates of speed with which they learn, and different rates
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of reading, different rates of speed in writing, ete. This 
fact greatly increases the difficulty of the teacher in 
adapting the work in any line of study to meet the 
needs and abilities of the pupils in his classes. The 
range of difference in the rate of learning has been 
found to be as great as one to three in some lines of 
work. The author found, in a simple test of drawing 
lines under the words belonging to the complete sub- 
jects of six sentences, that a freshman class of sixteen 
pupils varied in length of time from four and one half 
minutes to eleven minutes, or practically one to three. 
In the same test a sophomore class of twelve pupils 
varied in time from three and one half minutes to eight 
minutes; a junior class of twenty pupils varied in time 
from two to five minutes; and a senior group of fifteen 
pupils varied in time from three to six minutes. Ina 
similar English test of eight sentences the variation in 
time was as follows: sixteen freshmen varied from 
eight to fifteen minutes; twelve sophomores ranged 
from four to eight minutes; nineteen juniors varied 
from six to sixteen minutes; and seventeen seniors 
ranged from five to twelve minutes. 
The above data show very clearly that the range of 
time for a typical high school class is at least in the 
ratio of one to two, and often as great as one to three, 
in the reading of assigned material. That is to say, if 
the fastest member in a class takes thirty minutes to 
make a reasonable canvass of the lesson, it will take the 
slowest pupil in the same group at least sixty minutes
-P-A-G-E-143
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 129 
and very likely ninety minutes to do the same amount 
of work. This fact at once presents a very obvious 
problem to the teacher. The first step in solving the 
problem should be that of making a simple test similar 
to the one given above, and in this way find the exact 
time taken by each pupil in doing the same piece of 
work. This kind of test is particularly helpful on 
account of the fact that it requires reading and inter- 
pretation, on the part of the pupil, similar to the read- 
ing and interpretation that he must make when he 
reads his lesson assignment for the purpose of preparing 
his lesson. It is important for the teacher to know as 
accurately as possible just how wide differences actually 
exist in each class group that he teaches. The class 
may then be divided into two or three time groups and 
the assignment of subject-matter be adapted to the 
ability of each group. If only two or three pupils vary 
greatly from the mode of the group, then the teacher 
can provide for giving individual attention to these 
pupils outside of the regular class period. This will 
enable the teacher to give the same study assignment 
to the entire class, and it will enable him to keep the 
group progressing at approximately the same rate of 
speed. 
If every teacher will do this testing in each line of 
work that he is responsible for, and if other tests are 
devised and employed for the subjects in which this 
kind of test will not disclose the range of differences in 
the speed of learning, then the administrative officer 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
  130 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
will have a definite basis for determining the proper 
distribution of the pupil’s time to different numbers 
of classes. That is to say, the fastest. pupils might 
very well take five or six classes and then be required 
to do only the amount in each class that is required 
of the slow or medium speed pupil, while the slowest 
pupils might reasonably be required to take four classes 
and in some instances to take only three subjects. 
This whole problem must be based upon the real 
development of the pupil along the lines of mental 
maturity that have been set forth in the earlier dis- 
cussions. It is not merely the getting over the ground 
of subject-matter that counts, but rather the degree of 
actual growth that has been attained as a result of 
dealing with the subject-matter. One pupil may at- 
tain as much real growth in mental maturity by dealing 
with half as much subject-matter as another pupil 
requires to attain the same degree of development. 
At the same time, however, he may require as much 
time to deal with the smaller amount of subject-matter 
as the other pupil requires for the greater amount of 
subject-matter. This fact needs to be decided by 
scientific investigation; but the possibility of such a 
condition existing is so reasonable that teachers should 
take it into account in adapting the amount of subject- 
matter to the individual differences of pupils according 
to their rates of learning. 
This consideration of individual differences in rate 
of learning has a direct bearing upon the problem of
-P-A-G-E-145
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 131 
“making up” the work when the pupil has been absent. 
A bright pupil who learns rapidly may be able to keep 
up with everything that the class is doing, and yet be 
absent as much as half of the time, or in some cases 
even two thirds of the time. The teacher should take 
this into account, and make some provision with the 
consent and codperation of the administrative officer 
for allowing the pupil to do this. Then the pupil will 
not be so apt to “cut class,” as they term it, as he very 
frequently does when no such provision is made. He 
gets tired of marking time for the slower pupils to 
catch up, and stays out knowing that he can make it 
up readily before the end of the term or semester. The 
real problem is that of having the pupil attain the 
proper degree of mental maturity, or habit formation, 
or mental skill. He should not so much “make up” 
the study assignments as he should give evidence of 
having made the growth that the assignments were 
supposed to givehim. That is to say, he should “make 
up” the mental growth that would otherwise be lost 
to him. 
This point of view is vital. The pupil is too often 
made to feel that he has cheated the school by being 
absent from class. The other pupils are made to feel 
that this pupil gets something for nothing, or at least 
that they pay a greater price for the same amount of 
credit, when the pupil who has been absent a great 
deal receives credit at the end of the course. The 
fundamental issue is to make the pupil feel that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    132 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
school is an opportunity, and that being in class is his 
best way to capitalize the opportunity. This point of 
view will never get across thoroughly into the minds 
of the adolescent boy or girl until the school builds its 
course of study around units of human development 
that can be tested and measured accurately by means 
of psychological tests. This does not mean that the 
measurement of the mastery of fundamental bodies of 
facts will be abandoned, but it does mean most em- 
phatically that tests for facts will be restricted to the 
mastery of bodies of knowledge that are absolutely 
essential to human welfare. Even then the pupil will 
have no quarrel with the school, for he who can pass 
that sort of test will be given the same credit, even 
though he has been in school very little, as is given 
the pupil who has been in school every day. 
The usual difficulty is that the school does not ad- 
minister a really comprehensive test for the pupil who 
has been absent a good deal. The school should adapt 
its administration of the opportunities afforded each 
pupil, so that each type of learner can readily see the 
road to travel according to his ability. Then the pupil 
who needs the help of the teaching period every day 
will not feel that he is penalized, but rather that he is 
given greater opportunities for accomplishing the same 
degree of growth that the more capable pupils could 
and do accomplish with less attention on the part of 
the school. That is to say, the slower pupil should be 
made to feel that he would really be deprived of
-P-A-G-E-147
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 133 
advantages which he can not afford to be without if 
the school saw fit to run the class only as many days 
a week as would be necessary for the fastest pupil to 
make the desired degree of development. 
This range of individual differences in rates of learn- 
ing might be met in some cases by permitting the 
brightest and fastest pupil to carry two classes that 
meet during the same period. He might spend alter- 
nate days in these classes, or divide the time between 
the two classes by being present every day. At times 
a combination of these two administrative schemes 
might be the best way to conduct the work. What is 
needed, in any case, is a definite understanding on the 
part of the pupil as to what the types of development 
are that are to be gained by means of the different lines 
of work, and also some tangible evidences that he may 
use to check his progress from time to time. If this 
were worked out in regard to every subject and put 
before the pupil, the pupil would seek the opportunity 
to be tested rather than run away from the tests and 
examinations, as he so frequently does at present. 
One evidence of this argument may be found in the 
line of physical development. The pupil is glad to 
be weighed and to have his anthropometric measure- 
ments taken at any time in the course of his physical 
education. In fact, he seeks these tests of his progress 
in physical development. Why should he not be just 
as eager to know what his mental status is as he is to 
know his physical status? The answer is obvious 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  134 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
enough; but unfortunately we do not as yet have 
enough tangible goals of growth and the valid tests for 
measuring their attainment in connection with the 
different high school subjects. More can be done in 
this direction, however, than has been and is being 
done ordinarily by high school teachers and adminis- 
trators. Scientific investigations must ultimately give 
the solution of the problem, but we must accept the 
point of view first and then bend every energy to put 
it into practice. 
Differences in maturity.—The pupils in any high 
school class present a considerable range of maturity. 
The maturity of pupils varies along three lines of 
development, namely, chronological, anatomical, and 
organic. The chronological aspect of maturity is that 
which is presented by differences in actual mental years 
of development. This range of mental years, however, 
is based upon a recognized standard of chronological 
mental development. That is to say, if a pupil is 
fifteen years old chronologically and is perfectly nor- 
mal, he is fifteen years old mentally. If a pupil is 
fifteen years old chronologically and is graded as four- 
teen years old mentally, he is graded as having the 
mental development that a person of normal mentality 
would have if fourteen years old chronologically. 
Therefore such a pupil, although he has lived in this 
world fifteen years, has only made the mental growth 
that he should have made in fourteen years. This 
discussion will use the mental maturity in the sense of
-P-A-G-E-149
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 135 
normal chronological mental growth of the individual. 
The first point, then, is the fact that pupils of 
different ages will be in the same class. The second 
point is that pupils of different chronological ages will 
present a rather wide range of actual mental ages. 
Even a group of pupils of the same chronological age 
will present a range of mental ages. Therefore, when 
the teacher has a class that is open to, say, juniors and 
seniors, he must necessarily face a serious problem from 
the standpoint of mental maturity of the pupils. He 
will have a range of at least two or three years of 
difference in mental ages, and he is likely to have as 
high as five or six years’ difference. This will mean 
that the class will present rather wide differences in 
the unit of concept of thinking and in the judgment 
span. There will also be differences in the scope of 
attention and power of prolonged intensive attention. 
This will present a very difficult psychological problem. 
The pupil who finds the demand upon his scope of 
attention or the demands upon his power of prolonged 
attention too great becomes inattentive, for he soon 
loses out in the attempt to keep the pace. On the 
other hand, the pupil who is not called upon to exercise 
his complete scope of attention or to feel the strain 
of prolonged attention soon becomes inattentive be- 
cause he is not kept active enough. 
Any class of pupils presents different degrees of de- 
velopment of the bones of the skeleton. That is to 
say, the change from cartilaginous tissue to osseous
-P-A-G-E-150
    136 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
tissue is one form of physical maturity, and pupils of 
the same chronological age do not possess the same 
degree of osseous development. The degrees of dif- 
ference can not be determined by superficial observa- 
tions, but can be discovered only by X-ray pictures of 
the joints, particularly the joints of the hand and 
wrists. Such pictures have revealed ranges of from 
two to three years of difference in the anatomical 
development of pupils of the same age. The chief 
importance of this point for the high school teacher 
is that of watching carefully for the indications of rapid 
bodily growth of adolescents. This will be a rather 
rough, unscientific barometer of the anatomical de- 
velopment, and may be used as a fairly accurate guide 
in avoiding the danger of putting too much pressure 
upon the pupil who is growing rapidly in stature 
but maturing anatomically rather slowly. The loose, 
limber-jointed, awkward gait of the adolescent at this 
stage of development is unmistakable. The teacher 
should not expect as much from the pupil in this con- 
dition as he has a right to expect from the pupil who 
is anatomically more mature, or even of the pupil who 
is growing very slowly in stature between his periods 
of accelerated bodily growth. The mental gait of the 
youth at this awkward age is usually just as loose and 
limber as is his physical gait. His social and moral 
attitude and behavior exhibit much of the same general 
lack of firmness and control. Therefore, taking every- 
thing into consideration, the attitude toward their work
-P-A-G-E-151
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 137 
is perhaps the most serious difference in pupils that is 
brought about by the ranges of anatomical differences. 
This difference in attitude, however, is an evidence of 
a difference in general maturity of the individuals. 
Another difference in maturity that is presented by 
any high school class is the difference in the develop- 
ment of the vital organs of the body. The organs most 
affected are the organs of circulation and those of repro- 
duction. These undergo profound changes during the 
period of adolescence, and their growth affects the 
whole mental attitude and outlook of the individual. 
The pupil whose heart is enlarging rapidly can not 
stand the strain and pressure that a pupil can stand 
whose heart has become fairly stable in its develop- 
ment. Likewise, the pupil who is undergoing rapid 
development of the organs of reproduction is subject 
to mental confusions that the pupil who is fairly well 
matured sexually does not experience. Therefore the 
amount and the types of growth and development that 
should be expected of these pupils of varying ranges 
of organic development should be varied according to 
the maturity of the individuals. It should be a func- 
tion of the department of physical education to furnish 
the teachers of high school pupils with as much accu- 
rate data concerning both the anatomical and the 
organic maturity of the individuals in the various 
classes as is possible to secure through the best scien- 
tific means known to the medical world. Then the 
teachers can adapt their demands and their technique
-P-A-G-E-152
    138 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of teaching to meet the needs of the different indi- 
viduals in their classes. 
Differences in sex.—The modern high school is a 
coeducational institution; therefore virtually every 
class will present the problem of adapting the work to 
meet the different tendencies and traits of the two 
sexes. The adolescent boy and girl do not have the 
same interests and tastes in the choice of subjects, and 
frequently they do not have the same interests in 
different phases of the same subject. Take English, 
for example. The boy does not usually like the literary 
selections that appeal most to the girl, and vice versa. 
Likewise, in history the attitudes and interests of the 
two sexes are different enough to present a problem 
to the teacher. The boy usually excels in mathematics, 
while the girl is superior in languages. The critical 
problem is that of selecting subject-matter in any field 
that will bring about a satisfactory degree of develop- 
ment of both sexes and at the same time not be unduly 
burdensome to either sex. Then, too, the technique 
of dealing with the two sexes must be varied to meet 
the differences in general mental attitude and make-up 
of the adolescent boy and girl. The general mental 
qualities of the two sexes are appreciably different. 
This problem demands the most careful insight and 
the highest degree of teaching skill. 
The problem presented by these differences in 
emotional attitude on the part of the sexes is that of 
securing harmony in social reactions. One of the edu-
-P-A-G-E-153
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 139 
cational results that should come from coeducation is 
that of better understanding between the sexes. Each 
sex has its limitations and its peculiar characteristics. 
Each sex needs to acquire a sympathetic understanding 
of the limitations and peculiarities of the opposite sex. 
Therefore the working together upon subject-matter 
that is selected to meet this situation will enable each 
sex to acquire an insight into the tastes and attitudes 
of the other sex. This insight should bring respect, 
sympathy, and forbearance. If the problem is skil- 
fully handled, the boy, for example, will have an 
interest in learning why the girl has so much interest 
in a particular type of subject-matter, and this will lead 
him to a more careful study of both the subject-matter 
and the attitude of the girl toward it than he would 
otherwise give. A proper balance of subject-matter 
materials that appeal particularly to each sex will 
secure the best results. 
Types of minds.—Another important phase of indi- 
vidual differences is that of the difference in general 
mental habit and make-up. There are three distinct 
types of general mental habits. The first of these may 
be termed the encyclopedic mind. The chief charac- 
teristic of this type of mind is its ability to hold small 
groups of discrete facts in memory, and an almost 
absolute lack of ability to put these small groups 
together into larger unities. Such a mind seems to be 
like a box with a larger number of small compartments 
that are entirely shut off from one another. Knowl-
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
edge can be poured into these compartments until all 
are full; but the only way to extract any of this accu- 
mulation of knowledge is by asking isolated questions 
that are appropriate to each particular compartment. 
This type of mind takes facts as they come without 
sifting, selecting, correlating, or organizing. Every- 
thing is learned string measure, in unrelated and un- 
assimilated lumps. Frequently such a mind is marked 
for its unusual verbal memory. Many cases occur, 
however, where the individual possesses only a very 
ordinary power of memorization. No matter what the 
skill in memorizing may be, this type of mind holds 
the mental materials that it accumulates in isolated 
and different lumps. 
The great weakness of this type of mind is its in- 
ability to construct syntheses or unities of facts around 
some central idea or concept. Problem-solving for 
such an individual is a matter of guessing as to what 
facts will meet the situation. Therefore the pupil 
who possesses this type of mind will always fail when 
he faces the test of solving problems or answering 
questions that require the organization of a consider- 
able body of facts into well defined unities. On the 
other hand, such a pupil will make a high mark, pro- 
vided he possesses a fairly facile verbal memory, when 
given a test that consists of questions calling for small 
bodies of discrete facts. That is to say, a lot of dis- 
crete facts can be quizzed out of his mind, but a 
comprehensive organization of the facts stored in his
-P-A-G-E-155
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 141 
mind can not be quizzed out of it by a problem-solving 
question. 
The chief function of the teacher in educating such 
a type of mind is that of training the individual to 
organize his accumulations of different kinds of mental 
material into thought unities of more and more com- 
plex character as the ability of the learner develops. 
In other words, this type of pupil must be taught to 
use facts instead of cramming his mind full until it 
is like an encyclopedia. He must be taught to sift and 
select facts on the basis of their usability in construct- 
ing complex syntheses. He must be taught to abandon 
the habit of guessing and of answering problem ques- 
tions with discrete facts that it seems to him may do. 
In fine, he must be taught the science and art of 
synthetic thinking. 
The second type of mind may be termed the syn- 
thetic mind. The chief characteristic of this type is 
its ability to see the large syntheses or thought unities 
very clearly, with a vague awareness of the details out 
of which these unities are constructed, and a lack of 
ability to analyze the syntheses into the details or 
logically related groups of facts that underlie them. 
This type of mind is usually impatient about mastering 
comprehensive bodies of details and does not care for 
the practice of analyzing thought unities into their 
supporting steps or elements. The pupil who possesses 
this type of mind tends to be a dreamer. He has big 
ideas and a broad, indefinite point of view, but lacks
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the details that would render his big ideas concrete 
and definite enough to be put into practice. In other 
words, this kind of pupil is a good theorist as long as 
he is permitted to think in terms of large syntheses 
and is not required to work out the analytical steps 
that would be involved in a definite proof of the mean- 
ing or significance of these large thought wholes. This 
individual invariably fails when he faces a situation in 
which he must give answers to questions that call for 
discrete facts, or when he is confronted with the neces- 
sity for giving the detailed steps to prove a truth that, 
to his mind, is perfectly obvious. 
The chief function of the teacher in educating this 
type of pupil is that of training him to form habits of 
careful analyses of the large thought wholes that his 
mind is able to grasp without seeing clearly the sup- 
porting details. Then, too, he must acquire the habit 
of mastering these supporting detailed facts to such a 
degree that he sees their vital connection with the cen- 
tral idea or significance of the whole. That is to say, 
this pupil must be taught to analyze what goes on in 
his mind that enables him to see the truth of the 
syntheses. He must be taught to abandon the habit 
of being satisfied with a vague awareness of the sup- 
porting details or large thought wholes and to form the 
habit of establishing definite analytical proofs of his 
conclusions. 
The third type of mind may be termed analytic- 
synthetic. The distinguishing characteristic of this
-P-A-G-E-157
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 143 
type is its tendency and ability to analyze every 
thought whole presented to it into the supporting 
details and logical steps of proof, and also the tendency 
and ability to organize its accumulation of discrete 
facts into definite syntheses or usable thought wholes. 
This type of pupil seldom fails, for he answers isolated 
questions calling for discrete facts and problem ques- 
tions that demand either analysis or synthesis with 
about equal facility. Sometimes, however, this pupil 
does not possess a facile verbal memory; hence he fails 
when asked discrete questions: but he is right at home 
when he is given any sort of problem-solving questions, 
for he usually has enough facts organized into usable 
thought wholes to enable him to sift them out and 
adapt them to the solution of the questions at hand. 
The critical point.—The critical point in this con- 
nection is the fact that education of these three types 
of mind must consist in the giving of different sorts 
of training and practice to the pupils who possess them. 
Therefore in dealing with subject-matter as a means 
of educating individuals in spite of these differences, 
the teacher must give a different kind of assignment 
for studying the same subject-matter. That is to say, 
what constitutes a study assignment for one pupil does 
not become a study assignment for another pupil who 
possesses a different type of mind. For example, the 
pupil who has an encyclopedic mind must start with 
the detailed facts and construct a synthesis that he at 
first senses only very vaguely. On the other hand, the
-P-A-G-E-158
  144 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
pupil who has a synthetic mind must start with the 
synthesis, which he sees quite well, and must break it 
up into its supporting details. The final result for 
each pupil is the mastery of both the synthetic and 
the analytical processes of thinking the thought whole 
to be learned; but each pupil puts his chief effort and 
attention upon either the synthetic or the analytical 
aspect of the performance, as his case requires. 
This point may be made clear by taking a specific 
case in geometry. For example, the teacher wishes to 
employ the theorem, any exterior angle of a triangle 
is equal to the sum of the opposite interior angles, in 
the development of these two types of mind. The 
pupil of the discrete fact mind is able to see one at a 
time the facts involved in the proof. That is to say, 
he knows that the exterior angle and its adjacent in- 
terior angle form a straight angle, that a straight angle 
is equal to two right angles, that the sum of the angles 
of a triangle is equal to two right angles, that equals 
subtracted from equals the remainders are equal, that 
things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, 
ete.; but he can not put these facts together into a 
succession of logical steps that will construct the syn- 
thetic mathematical fact that is expressed by the 
theorem. Therefore his assignment must be that of 
putting known facts together until whenever he looks 
at such a figure the thought of the theorem is clearly 
seen. That is to say, he must go over the path of 
construction until he habitually sees the synthetic
-P-A-G-E-159
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 145 
relationship between the exterior angle and the oppo- 
site interior angles of the triangle. 
On the other hand, the pupil who possesses a syn- 
thetic mind should be assigned the task of breaking 
the synthesis up into its supporting steps of proof. 
This pupil sees at once that the synthetic relationship 
exists, but he does not see the details that are fused 
in his thought processes into the unity expressed by 
the theorem. In other words, he senses the equality 
of the sum of the angles of the triangle and the sum 
of the exterior and adjacent interior angles, but he does 
not think this equality in terms of the definite mathe- 
matical facts, each sum being equal to two right angles, 
things equal to the same thing are equal to each other, 
equals subtracted from equals the remainders are equal, 
etc. Therefore he must start with the synthesis and 
work out the detailed mathematical analysis that will 
establish clearly in his thinking the analytical relation- 
ships that his mind fuses so readily into the synthetic 
relationship of the thought expressed by the theorem. 
Then again, this same assignment for the pupil who 
possesses the analytic-synthetic mind should be that 
of both analysis and synthesis, with equal emphasis 
upon each phase of the total performance—the only 
difference in his assignment being that of point of 
attack and degree of stress upon the habits to be 
formed. 
The important point to keep in mind is that the 
pupils may, and no doubt do, possess all the mathe-
-P-A-G-E-160
    146 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
matical facts involved in the problem, but each pupil 
possesses a different general mental habit; hence each 
must work at the task of using the known facts as a 
means of establishing a new type of general mental 
habit that he does not possess and does not tend to 
practise. The assignment for each pupil should be 
such as to make clear to each one the exact mental 
result that he should work to secure. Hence, although 
each pupil proves the theorem, the assignment of each 
pupil is different, for each has a different educational 
result to attain through the manipulation of the 
mathematical data involved in setting up the steps of 
the proof. 
The function of the teacher in this case is not to 
teach the theorem, but to teach each pupil to form the 
kind of mental habit that he does not possess or that 
he possesses to an inadequate degree. The theorem 
is only a means, and is important only as it affords a 
ready means for the development of the two distinct 
types of mental habit that every pupil should develop 
thoroughly if he is to acquire the mental maturity 
that education ought to give. The point of distinc- 
tion between teaching the subject and teaching the 
pupil by means of the subject can not be emphasized 
too much, and this illustration shows very clearly how 
vastly important it is for the teacher to keep his 
attention upon what is going on in the mind of the 
pupil, and also the importance of having each pupil 
go over thoroughly again and again the route of syn-
-P-A-G-E-161
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 147 
thesis or analysis, or both, as the type of the pupil’s 
mind may determine, until the needed mental habit 
is well established. The vital point is not that the 
pupil gave the proof for the theorem, but the real issue 
is, what did giving the proof do to the mind of the 
pupil in the way of establishing a mental habit and 
development that was not there before, and that would 
not be likely to be formed without the guiding hand 
of the teacher? 
Types of imagery.—Another important aspect of 
individual differences is that of the kinds of sensory 
images upon which the pupil depends in his learning. 
One pupil may depend very largely upon visual images 
in mastering any and all kinds of subject-matter ma- 
terials. Another may be able to learn most effectively 
through audition. A third pupil may learn most 
economically through motor images. Every pupil no 
doubt employs each of these forms of imagery in his 
learning, but he usually does not depend upon each 
of them to the same degree. This difference in degree 
of intensity with which different pupils employ these 
different forms of imagery presents a real problem to 
the teacher. Failure to recognize this fact of differ- 
ences in the intensive employment of imagery may lead 
to very serious inefficiency in teaching. The problem 
bears particularly upon the selection and manipulation 
of devices and upon the selection of technique to be 
used in each particular teaching situation. 
The pupil who depends upon visualization is seri-  
-P-A-G-E-162
148 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
ously handicapped in his learning attempts if he does 
not receive adequate visual stimulation. Take the 
learning of foreign language, for example. The visual- 
izer can not master the pronunciation of the words, nor 
can he master their forms effectively, without seeing 
them in written or printed existence. Such a pupil has 
a very difficult time in the class when the instruction 
is almost wholly oral and in the foreign tongue. He 
hears the language symbols uttered, but he can not get 
a significant auditory image. Give this pupil the 
written form along with its auditory image, and he 
translates from the visual into the auditory, and in 
this way acquires the necessary auditory imagery for 
oral speech. The visual imagery may also be trans- 
lated into the appropriate motor imagery through the 
writing of the words that are visualized. 
The visualizer has difficulty in mastering mathe- 
matical concepts and mathematical relationships when 
they are not presented to him in some kind of graphic 
form. He simply can not grasp the logic of the situa- 
tion through auditory images or through motor images 
unless these forms of imagery are the translations of 
adequate visual images. This same truth holds in the 
learning of history, sciences, etc. The visualizer must 
always have an adequate stimulation of visual imagery 
that he can translate into the appropriate auditory and 
motor forms of imagery. Even then he will not make 
the translations unless the auditory and motor forms 
of imagery are useful in giving him mastery over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 149 
learning situation in a way that he can not attain with- 
out them. 
The pupil who is largely dependent upon visual 
images for his learning materials may be seriously 
handicapped by the fact that he possesses defective 
visual organs. Such a pupil will find more difficulty 
in making accurate translations into the other forms 
of imagery. Moreover, this same pupil may be still 
further handicapped by the fact that he has poor habits 
of visualizing different kinds of language and graphic 
presentations. The importance of these two aspects 
of the pupil’s sensory acuity and his sensory habits has 
been pointed out under the discussion of method. The 
point will bear emphasis, however, and the teacher 
should make a critical study of each pupil under his 
charge in order to determine the extent to which each 
pupil depends upon visualization to supply his learn- 
ing materials, and also the degree to which each pupil 
is handicapped by defective visual acuity and ineffec- 
tive habits of visualization. 
The pupil who depends upon auditory imagery is 
seriously handicapped in his learning performance if 
he fails to receive an adequate opportunity for acquir- 
ing the subject-matter materials through auditory 
presentation. If this type of pupil is studying foreign 
language, for example, he is unable to build up the 
appropriate associations necessary for effective memor- 
izing of vocabulary by means of visual images. He 
must first hear the word pronounced and he must build
-P-A-G-E-164
    150 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
up auditory associations that he is able to translate 
readily into the correct visual form before he can deal 
effectively with visual forms either for purposes of 
interpretation or for expression. That is to say, this 
type of pupil must master the auditory images of the 
foreign words before he can translate readily the foreign 
materials from the printed page or translate the native 
language materials from the printed page. Mastery 
over the foreign language must necessarily involve the 
ability to deal effectively with both the visual and the 
auditory forms of imagery, but the pupil who depends 
upon auditory imagery for the fundamental basis of 
his learning must develop facility of translation from 
auditory to visual imagery. Therefore he must have 
the kinds of practice opportunities that will enable him 
first to develop the auditory images appropriate to the 
foreign language materials, and second he must develop 
the appropriate visual images by associating them with 
the auditory images already developed. 
The pupil who depends upon motor imagery as the 
chief avenue through which to acquire subject-matter 
materials is always seriously handicapped in his learn- 
ing procedure if he does not find ample opportunity to 
build up effective motor images that are appropriate 
to the subject-matter materials presented to him. If 
this type of pupil is studying foreign language, he must 
write the forms and he must speak the words in order 
to develop appropriate associations of meaning with 
the new symbols of speech. These motor associations
-P-A-G-E-165
ee ee ee 
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 151 
are translated into the appropriate visual and auditory 
images that are necessary to master in order to give 
him mastery over the printed page and over oral usage 
of the language. The point is that the motor images 
must precede the visual and auditory images in order 
for this type of pupil to learn most economically and 
most effectively. Therefore this type of pupil must 
be given ample practice in developing the appropriate 
forms of motor images before he is called upon to make 
use of the visual and auditory forms of imagery that 
are appropriate to the same foreign language symbols. 
The critical point.—The critical point for the teacher 
is that of determining, in the case of each pupil, just 
what kind of study assignment and just what kind of 
study practice on the part of each pupil will amply 
provide for each of these types of pupils. The same 
subject-matter materials may be assigned for study, 
that is to say, the same subject-matter unit may be 
assigned to the entire group; but the character of the 
instruction should be adapted to these three types of 
pupils. The visual-minded pupil must be instructed 
how to acquire facility of mastering visual images of 
the language materials, how to acquire facility of trans- 
lation from the visual images into the appropriate 
auditory and motor forms of imagery. The auditory- 
minded pupil must be taught how best to master audi- 
tory images of the foreign language symbols and how 
best to develop skill in translating these images into 
the appropriate visual and motor images for these same  
-P-A-G-E-166
  
  | 
152 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
symbols. The motor-minded pupil must be guided in 
acquiring mastery over the motor images that are 
appropriate to the language forms that are to be 
mastered, and he must learn how to translate these 
forms readily into the appropriate visual and auditory 
forms of imagery. Therefore, while the goal of the 
study assignment is the same for all the pupils in the 
class, the study assignment is different for the three 
types of pupils, according to the form of imagery upon 
which they depend for the initial mastery of the sub- 
ject-matter under consideration. 
A teaching period can not be carried on successfully 
until the pupils have developed a fundamental form 
of imagery appropriate to the language materials being 
studied, and not until they have also mastered the 
translations from these fundamental forms of imagery 
into the auditory-motor, visual-motor, visual-auditory, 
as the case may be, for each pupil, according to whether 
he is visual-, or auditory-, or motor-minded. If this 
basis is well established through careful study assign- 
ments upon which the pupils work independently, and 
through teaching periods in which the teacher directs 
the study of individual pupils and the study of the 
pupils grouped according to the type of imagery that 
is fundamental for each group, then the teaching 
periods from that time on can be well utilized in dealing 
with study of subject-matter units upon which all are 
ready to work effectively. The teacher can then vary 
his technique of handling the presentation of subject-
-P-A-G-E-167
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 153 
matter materials so that each type of imagery will be 
made the starting-point for each type of pupil and each 
translation combination will be carried on effectively. 
The situation as described in regard to foreign 
language is no different from that of any other high 
school subject. Every subject may be approached 
through any one of the types of imagery, but trans- 
lations into the other forms of imagery are necessary 
for complete mastery of the important facts, concepts, 
and mental habits involved in the study of the par- 
ticular field of materials. How to meet these indi- 
vidual differences in the employment of imagery has 
an immediate connection with the problem of selecting 
appropriate and effective devices and a most vital 
bearing upon the problem of selecting and practising 
an effective technique of class-room procedure. The 
above paragraph has pointed out in a suggestive way 
the connection between the psychology underlying 
the situation and the direction in which the teacher 
must plan in order to build upon the psychological 
foundation. 
Preferences for forms of materials.—Pupils mani- 
fest individual differences in their preferences for the 
forms in which ideas may be embodied. Some writers 
have classified them as idea-thinkers and thing- 
thinkers. This classification does not seem sound 
psychologically, but the practical implications back of 
the classification are valid. That is to say, no pupil 
thinks without ideas, for ideas are the materials with
-P-A-G-E-168
154 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
which thought must deal. The real point is that pupils 
can not get at the ideas with which to carry on their 
thinking with equal facility when these ideas are 
embodied in different forms of existences. The so- 
called idea-thinker is the individual who can get at 
ideas readily when they are embodied in language 
forms. The so-called thing-thinker is the individual 
who can get at ideas most readily when they are 
embodied in forms of objects, such as machinery, 
buildings, natural forms of plant, animal, and other 
existences. That is to say, the one type of learner 
acquires the fundamental truths and relationships of 
subject-matter units most readily when these truths 
and relationships are stripped of their most concrete 
embodiments and expressed in the most abstract form 
of symbolism, while the other type of learner acquires 
these same truths most readily when his thinking is 
stimulated by the concrete materials of their existence. 
Each type of pupil must think by means of ideas and 
each must crystallize his thought in abstract concepts 
of the truths and relationships involved in the situa- 
tion; but the one pupil is helped in making his abstrac- 
tions by the meagerness of the embodying materials, 
whereas the other pupil is helped in making his abstrac- 
tions by the ampleness of the embodying materials. 
For example, the one pupil can get the mechanical 
principle involved in the timing of the spark in the 
gas-engine best by studying the language statements 
of that principle. The language is sufficient to stimu-
-P-A-G-E-169
  INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES 155 
late his power of constructive imagination to build up 
the relationships involved in the concepts of the prin- 
ciple. On the other hand, the so-called thing-thinker 
gets little from the language statements, but the gas- 
engine itself in actual existence stimulates his power of 
constructive imagination and he sees through the 
materials, so to speak, to the abstractions that are 
embodied in the mechanical parts of the mechanism. 
These individual preferences for the forms of ma- 
terial in which the fundamental ideas may be embodied 
present a serious problem for the teacher. The prob- 
lem is largely one of selecting appropriate devices and 
of practising effective technique in the class-room. 
SUMMARY 
The pupils in any high school class present several 
aspects of individual differences. They possess widely 
different backgrounds of experience and training, due 
to differences in home environment and general oppor- 
tunities for spontaneous education. This range of 
individual differences in a class is increased by the fact 
that many elective courses are open to pupils from at 
least two consecutive class ranks, such as junior and 
senior. The rate of speed with which pupils learn 
varies as much as one to three and more. High school 
pupils in any class vary greatly in the range of mental 
ages, anatomical development, and organic maturity. 
The two sexes also present differences in mental tastes,
-P-A-G-E-170
156 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
attitudes, and general qualities df mind. High school 
pupils in general exhibit three types of mind, namely, 
encyclopedic, synthetic, and analytic-synthetic. High 
school pupils also exhibit three types of mind on the 
basis of the chief forms of imagery upon which they 
depend in their learning of subject-matter materials, 
namely, visual-, auditory-, and motor-mindedness. 
Pupils have decided preferences for the forms of ma- 
terials through which ideas may be embodied. Some 
think best when dealing with language, while others 
think most readily when dealing with objects. All of 
these differences demand careful adaptation of de- 
mands, subject-matter, and technique of teaching. 
Only a thorough insight into these factors and a high 
degree of skill will insure the success of the high school 
teacher.

CHAPTER VI 
ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 
The central idea that has brought the subject- 
matter into existence——Any body of subject-matter 
as a whole is organized around some central idea or 
racial need. The race, for example, felt the need of 
preventing and curing the ills to which the human 
family is heir. The attempt to satisfy this need 
brought about the study of the human body and the 
study of medicine. Therefore the subject of physi- 
ology is organized around the central idea of preserving 
human life through a knowledge of the functions of 
the organs of the human body and how to care for 
them. Medicine is organized around the idea of curing 
diseases. Take language for another example. The 
central idea is the expression and interpretation of 
ideas. Every phase of grammar, rhetoric, composition, 
and literary study centers around this racial need. 
The divisions and the subdivisions of a subject are 
determined by this central idea. The large codrdinate 
divisions are the large outstanding principles that most 
adequately exhibit the existence of the central idea. 
The next largest divisions, that is, the chief sub- 
divisions, are the largest minor principles involved 
159 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
    160 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
under each of the large divisions. These groups of 
subdivisions are made up of those that most adequately 
help the large divisions to exhibit the central idea. 
The next group of subdivisions are the minor principles 
under each of the larger subdivisions that most ade- 
quately help the larger subdivisions to help the main 
divisions exhibit the central idea, and so on down to 
the most minute details that may be employed in the 
subject. Any one of the minute details of the lowest 
subdivisions, when taken alone, will exhibit the central 
idea to a sufficient degree to make it rightly classed as 
belonging in the subject. It, however, will not exhibit 
the central idea very adequately when compared with 
the degree to which the central idea is exhibited by the 
largest divisions of the subject. This fact explains 
why it is a minute minor detail instead of an out- 
standing large division. 
Commercial geography is a good subject to illustrate 
how a central idea governs the organization of a body 
of subject-matter. The central idea in this subject 
is the distribution of commercial elements in space. 
The human race felt the need of information regarding 
the location of the various kinds of materials and forces 
that enable it to carry on commercial and industrial 
activities. The attempt to satisfy this need brought 
the facts of commercial geography together into an 
organized form. Some of the large divisions of the 
subject that most adequately exhibit this central idea 
are the agricultural areas, mineral-producing areas,
-P-A-G-E-175
  
ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 161 
stock-producing areas, transportation routes, etc. That 
is to say, each of these items represents a rather wide 
distribution in space. Then it is readily seen that the 
subdivisions under agricultural areas, such as wheat- 
producing areas, etc., each organizes a smaller distri- 
bution in space than that represented by the large 
division, agricultural areas. Then, the subdivisions 
under each of these subdivisions represent still smaller 
areas of distribution. Take wheat, for instance, and 
the subdivisions are such as winter wheat areas, spring 
wheat areas, and so on down to the smallest areas of 
distribution that it is important to know. Each suc- 
ceeding subdivision exhibits less and less distribution 
in space. On the other hand, each subdivision helps 
to extend the distribution in space of its immediate 
larger division, so that the vast area of distribution in 
space exhibited by each of the largest codrdinate divi- 
sions of the subject is but the sum of all the smaller 
areas of distribution. 
Relation of organization around central idea to 
method of learning.+The fact that a subject is always 
organized around a central idea, and especially the fact 
that the divisions and subdivisions are determined by 
the extent to which they exhibit this central idea, bears 
an important relation to the universal method of 
learning. The first step in learning is to see the thing 
as awhole. Therefore the recognition of the central 
idea in a subject, and seeing the largest divisions that 
exhibit this idea, is the first whole that should be
-P-A-G-E-176
  162 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
brought before the learner. \) As this more or less vague 
whole is worked over, the significance of the central 
idea becomes clearer. The clearing up of the signifi- 
cance of the central idea leads to a recognition of the 
next lower group of subdivisions. That is to say, the 
process of analysis is stimulated and carried on by 
taking each large division in turn as a whole, and 
working out its largest subdivisions. Then each of 
these subdivisions is taken in turn as a whole and 
analyzed. And then each next lower subdivision is 
taken in turn and analyzed. This process of analysis 
goes on until each large division in turn has been 
worked down into its smaller and smaller wholes, the 
number constantly increasing until all of the important 
details are known. Then the final process of synthesis 
—that is, the third step in learning—begins and is 
carried on until the unity of the whole body of facts 
is clearly recognized. Practice upon this analytic- 
synthetic procedure renders it habit. The learner then 
sees the central significance of the subject as exhibited 
by a great body of organized details. 
Content and formal materials—Every subject 
should be carefully organized around its central idea in 
such a way as to give the proper balance between 
content and formal subject-matter. The content ma- 
terial is made up of the facts that are to be used in 
the exact form in which they are presented. The 
content material is the essence, the worth-while part 
of the course, and it should be thoroughly learned, or 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 163 
at least thoroughly gone through and understood, 
according to the purpose for which the course is offered. 
For example, the rule in algebra for factoring the 
difference between two squares is content material. 
It is important to know this fact. Again, a definition 
of a figure of speech in English is content material. 
Formal material is practice material that is not impor- 
tant in and of itself, but has value only as a means 
of exhibiting the content material in order that it may 
be thoroughly learned. For example, the problems in 
algebra that present differences between squares are 
not valuable to remember. The pupil does not need 
to remember that he solved the problem x* — y®. He 
solves many such problems in order that he may 
habitually think and apply the rule for factoring quan- 
tities of that type. Likewise, the pupil in English does 
not remember the particular cases of synecdoche that 
he analyzed in order to fix in his mind the character- 
istics of that figure of speech. The formal material, 
then, is the material by means of which thorough men- 
tal habits are formed. 
The critical problem is that of determining the 
amount of formal or practice material that is necessary 
in order to insure the thorough mastery of the content 
material. This fact is gradually beginning to be 
realized by the administrators and teachers who are 
responsible for the making of courses of study. We 
are coming to see that a good many subjects have out- 
lined about twice as much content material as can be
-P-A-G-E-178
  164 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
thoroughly mastered in the school year. The tendency 
now is toward increasing the amount of formal or 
practice material and cutting down the amount of 
content material. The exact balance between content 
and formal material must necessarily depend upon the 
particular group studying the subject, and there should 
be provision for recognizing the individual differences 
in the class. One pupil may require twice as much 
formal material and practice as another in mastering 
a certain body of content subject-matter. The tenta- 
tive or approximate balance between the two kinds of 
material should be determined and indicated in the 
outline of the course. This tentative balancing of 
content and formal material should be determined by 
careful experimentation with typical groups of high 
school pupils. 
The ultimate guide for determining the relative 
amount of formal material that should follow the pre- 
sentation of each body of content material is that of 
the degree of mastery over the content that is desired. 
If mere acquaintance with content subject-matter is 
all that is desired, then a relatively meager amount of 
formal material will be sufficient to insure an intel- 
ligent understanding of the material. If, however, 
thoroughgoing habit formation is the aim, then a 
sufficient amount of formal material must be intro- 
duced to render the habit automatic enough for it to 
function adequately without future training. That is 
to say, the organization of a unit or of a half-unit of
-P-A-G-E-179
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 165 
subject-matter as a whole demands the balancing of 
the content and formal material in the light of the 
vital, specific aims of education that are to be secured 
through the study of the particular subject under con- 
sideration, but the working out of this organization 
demands the determining, in accordance with the men- 
tal maturity of the typical adolescent group for whom 
the course is intended, of the actual amount of content 
subject-matter, along with its appropriate amount of 
formal material, that should make up the unit or half- 
unit. 
The inductive organization of subject-matter-_The 
inductive organization of subject-matter is based upon 
the idea that the pupil will learn the content subject- 
matter most readily through the study of individual 
cases in which the content is exhibited. } That is to say, 
the pupil discovers the content through experiencing 
its existence a number of times. Take, for example, 
the algebraic rule for factoring the difference between 
two squares. The pupil begins his study by factoring 
a number of such quantities experimentally. His at- 
tention is centered in each case first upon the fact that 
the problem presents the difference of two squares, and 
second upon the fact that one of the factors is always 
the sum of the two numbers squared and the other is 
always the difference of the two numbers. He soon 
reaches the conclusion that this is always true, and is 
ready to state the rule or the content that is to be 
learned. 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  166 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
The relative amount of formal material and content 
material is clearly emphasized by the inductive organ- 
ization of subject-matter. A sufficient number of 
formal cases must be presented to insure the discovery 
and clear understanding of the content. Then, if 
thorough mastery over the content is desired, an 
adequate amount of formal material must be employed 
after the content has been discovered and clearly set 
forth. 
The amount of formal material needed in enabling 
the pupil to discover the content and to come to an 
intelligent conclusion in regard to it may be reduced 
to the minimum through employing only typical cases. 
The pupil must be made to understand, however, when 
he has reached the conclusion concerning the content, 
that the cases are typical and that he should seek to 
verify his conclusion through more extended experi- 
ence. The amount of formal material employed after 
the discovery of the content should be determined by 
the laws of habit formation and the capabilities of the 
individual pupils. 
The chief value of the inductive organization of 
subject-matter—The chief value of the inductive 
organization of subject-matter lies in the fact that it 
enables the pupil to acquire and accumulate the ex- 
periences that must be acquired in order to understand 
the content.) For example, the pupil must have the 
mental experience of recognizing the algebraic quantity 
that presents the difference between two squares before
-P-A-G-E-181
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 167 
he can understand the rule for factoring this type of 
quantity. Moreover, he needs to have the mental 
experience of recognizing this particular type of quan- 
tity enough times to recognize the type readily. The 
pupil will not be likely to have had the experiences 
necessary to enable him readily to recognize this type 
of quantity by the time he reaches the point where 
the learning of the rule is advisable. Therefore the 
inductive organization of material enables the pupil 
to acquire the mathematical experiences that are neces- 
sary to an understanding of the rule for factoring them, 
and at the same time it introduces him to the rule. 
The conclusion seems valid, then, that whenever the 
pupil lacks the fundamental experiences that are neces- 
sary for the understanding of a certain content that is 
to be learned, the most effective and economical 
organization of subject-matter is that of induction. 
One can not say absolutely in advance whether the 
subject-matter in any high school subject should as a 
whole, or even in part, be organized inductively for 
most effective and economical presentation. One may 
conclude, however, on the basis of a number of years 
of experience in teaching beginning courses, such as 
languages and algebra, that few pupils who take these 
courses will have had the necessary linguistic and 
mathematical experiences to enable them to grasp the 
content upon mere statement of rules and definitions; 
or one may conclude that only certain phases of these 
courses should be organized inductively. Many of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  168 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
high school subjects are elective, and therefore are open 
to pupils of a rather wide range of ages and training; 
hence the problem of determining whether the subject- 
matter of such courses should be organized inductively 
or not is greatly complicated. About the best thing 
for the teacher to do in such cases is to judge as best 
he can to what extent any considerable number of 
pupils in the course is lacking in the fundamental 
experiences necessary to an understanding of the con- 
tent material that is to be learned, and upon the basis 
of this judgment to determine whether or not the 
material should be organized inductively. In any case, 
this type of organization is fairly safe, for the wide- 
awake teacher can quickly discover whether or not the 
pupils are meeting new experiences in the subject- 
matter presented or merely reviewing old experiences 
that seem familiar, and if resourceful, can readily shift 
the form of organization when occasion demands a 
change for effective work. 
The critical point, then, in determining the validity 
of the inductive organization of the subject-matter in 
high school subjects is that of really knowing what 
experiences the pupils in a course have had and what 
the effects of these experiences have been. The fact 
that a pupil has had a course in Latin before taking 
up the study of French does not assure the teacher that 
such a pupil has acquired and retained language ex- 
periences that can be capitalized. The teacher needs 
to know not only the quantity but also the quality of
-P-A-G-E-183
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 169 
the language experiences that have left their impress 
upon the pupil’s mind. Even a grade mark does not 
enlighten one very much as to the actual results of 
a pupil’s experiences, because it stands for too many 
things in general and can not adequately represent 
specific results. No one knows exactly what 75 per 
cent. or 95 per cent. in language, or in any subject for 
that matter, really means. Here again the conclusion 
seems valid that about the best way to determine the 
quality of the pupil’s language experiences is to give 
him language experiences, and to be alert to discover 
whether they seem to be new to him or whether they 
seem familiar. Then, in the light of the findings, 
organize the subject-matter of the course. 
The deductive organization of subject-matter.— 
The deductive organization of subject-matter is that 
form of organization which presents the statement of 
the law, rule, definition, or concept as the first whole 
to be considered. The individual cases are then pre- 
sented, and the pupil looks for the verification of the 
generalization that has been studied. After examining 
a number of cases that adequately exhibit the gen- 
eralization, he concludes that the generalization is a 
valid one and feels that he understands it. Then, if 
thorough mastery over the generalization is sought, 
the verification of the existence of the generalization 
in individual cases must be continued until habit is 
formed. 
The deductive organization of material starts with 
   
-P-A-G-E-184
| 170 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the content subject-matter stated in its most universal 
form. It then proceeds to the presentation of formal 
material for the purpose of practice in recognizing the 
existence of the generalization. The amount of formal 
material presented is determined by the degree of 
habit that is desired in mastering the material, and by 
the past experiences and training of the pupil. 
The chief value in the deductive organization of 
material is that it affords opportunity for capitalizing 
the past experiences of the pupil. Every individual, 
as he goes about in this world, accumulates many hap- 
hazard experiences, which remain more or less isolated 
in his mind until some demand brings them together 
and organizes them into a coherent scheme of thinking. 
Therefore the presentation of a generalization may be 
the means of assembling the individual’s isolated ex- 
periences and unifying them. In fact, the individual 
may have had so many experiences of the right kind, 
and so recently, that he is able through memory to 
supply the data necessary for a thorough analysis of 
the generalization presented, and he may even form 
a fairly adequate habit of mental organization of these 
experiences as verifications of the generalization. 
Whenever this is the case, the deductive organization’ 
of subject-matter is the most economical form in which 
to present the subject. 
The effective employment of the deductive organiza- 
tion of subject-matter, then, depends upon the quantity 
and also the quality of the past experiences of the pupil.
-P-A-G-E-185
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 171 
This fact makes very imperative the necessity for 
knowing something fairly definite about the mental 
material the pupil already has that may be capitalized 
in mastering the generalization to be learned. The 
teacher who selects the deductive type of organization 
or arrangement of subject-matter without knowing 
what the mental background of the pupil is will not 
infrequently find that the attempt to analyze the state- 
ment of the generalization is fruitless, and he will be 
compelled to abandon the deductive order of arrange- 
ment for the inductive organization. This will usually 
be done at a considerable loss of time and energy. 
The resourceful teacher will always be alert to dis- 
cover the mental material that the pupil has, and also 
the quality of the mental processes that are involved 
in the analysis and synthesis of any body of subject- 
matter presented, and he will change readily from 
deductive organization to inductive, or from inductive 
to deductive, as the situation may demand. This 
change from the one type of organization to the other 
may be made so skilfully as to minimize the amount 
of loss due to wrong selection of the type of organiza- 
tion at the outset. The well trained teacher will effect 
this change even during the progress of a teaching 
period, if the situation demands such change. 
The relation of induction to method.The induc- 
tive arrangement of subject-matter insures that the 
first unit or whole that the pupil learns will be an indi- 
vidual case that embodies the generalization that is to
-P-A-G-E-186
  172 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
be learned. } For example, in learning the rule for 
factoring the difference between two squares, the pupil 
starts with a typical problem such as 2? — y*. He 
sees this quantity as a whole, and by analysis discovers 
that each term is a square and that the quantity is 
represented by the difference between the squares. 
Further analysis enables him to discover that the fac- 
tors are the sum and the difference of the numbers that 
have been squared. By synthesis he verifies the cor- 
rectness of this result, and now thinks the difference of 
the squares as produced by multiplying the sum and 
difference of the numbers squared. He takes up an- 
other individual case and goes through the same pro- 
cedure. He continues this process of analyzing and 
synthesizing individual cases until he begins to realize 
that he has accumulated a body of similar experiences. 
He now begins to attend to this body of experiences 
asa whole. He analyzes this whole and discovers the 
identical elements running through it. Then by syn- 
thesis he formulates the generalization, which he states 
in the form of a rule. 
The relation between the inductive arrangement and 
the method of learning is clear cut. The mind first 
takes an individual case as a whole, then another indi- 
vidual case as a whole, etc.; then the body of experi- 
ences gained through dealing with the individual cases 
is taken as the whole, and finally fixes attention upon 
the statement of the rule as a synthetic whole. 
The relation of deduction to method.The deduc-
-P-A-G-E-187
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 173 
tive arrangement of material insures that the mind of 
the learner will start with the statement of a general- 
ization as a whole. \This generalization is analyzed 
and reorganized into a clearly understood whole. Then 
the learner takes an individual case as a whole that 
embodies the generalization, then another individual 
case, etc., until he feels that he has attained skill in 
recognizing the embodiment of the generalization. 
That is to say, he views his successes as a whole in 
dealing with individual cases, and through analysis and 
synthesis arrives at the conclusion that the significance 
of his successes taken as a whole indicates a satisfactory 
degree of mastery over the application of the general- 
ization. 
The relation of induction to deduction.The induc- 
tive arrangement of subject-matter is just the reverse 
of the order in which the different types of wholes or 
units are taken up for consideration in the deductive 
arrangement. Each arrangement insures a definite 
series|of units or wholes that are presented in a regular 
order. Each order of arrangement stimulates the 
fundamental movement of the mind of the learner 
and calls forth the same mental processes in mastering 
the materials presented. That is to say, then, induc- 
tion and deduction are merely different orders of 
arrangement of the essential units or wholes that must 
be considered by the learner in mastering the subject- 
matter presented. 
The problem organization of subject-matter.—
-P-A-G-E-188
  174 - TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
Another type of organization of subject-matter is that 
of arranging the materials in a series of problems. The 
attempt to solve the problem leads to the mastery of 
the fundamental facts, rules, laws, definitions, and 
concepts in the particular field of subject-matter. The 
field of United States history, for example, may be 
organized in the form of a series of political problems. 
The period of national development especially is 
adapted to this type of organization. Such problems 
as financing the government, the extent to which power 
should be centralized in the federal government, 
policies that should be determined by the states, etc., 
are typical of the sort of organization that is meant. 
The study of the solution of these problems involves 
the mastery of the important facts of United States 
history during the period of national development. 
The sciences may be organized very readily as series © 
of problems. In fact, virtually every subject may be 
so organized. That is to say, series of conditions and 
questions may be formulated whose answers are prob- 
lematical; hence the conclusions can be reached only 
through working out solutions that will be reliable 
according to the supporting data. 
The project form of organization of subject-matter. 
—tThe project form of organization is the presentation 
of actual undertakings that are projected, that is to 
say, are carried forward to the achievement of the 
natural outcome of the undertakings. For example, 
the making of a library table in manual training would 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 175 
be a project. The raising of a prize pig in agriculture 
would be a project. The making of a dress in domestic 
art would be a project. 
The project type of organization is difficult to main- 
tain in most of the high school subjects. Domestic 
science and art, agriculture and manual training, may 
be organized into series of projects that will involve the 
mastery of the important bodies of subject-matter in 
these respective fields. Even these subjects, however, 
present difficulties in the actual carrying out of any 
considerable number of worth-while projects. When 
it comes to such subjects as physics, chemistry, lan- 
guage, etc., the possible use of projects is very limited 
if not well-nigh impossible. 
The relation of the project to the problem—A 
project is a situation that involves a number of prob- 
lems that must be solved satisfactorily in order to 
carry out the project successfully. Take the project 
of making a library table in manual training, for ex- 
ample. The first series of problems pertains to decid- 
ing the number of parts, the dimensions, the kinds of 
material, and the kind of finish to give it. A second 
series of problems pertains to determining the kinds of 
tools to use and how to keep them in proper condition 
for the piece of work. A third series of problems per- 
tains to the principles of construction and the skills 
requisite to executing them in the actual realization 
of the project. 
The critical question.—The critical question is, shall
-P-A-G-E-190
  176 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the project be the goal, or only the means that will 
introduce the pupil to these series of problems as the 
goal? That is to say, shall the pupil make a library 
table in order to learn how to saw, to plane, to make 
a mortise joint, to put on a mission finish, etc., or shall 
he learn to saw, plane, etc., in order that he may make 
a library table, if he chooses, or any other kind of 
object that involves the same problems? The answer 
seems fairly obvious, namely, that the goal of education 
is the mastery of problems that may be involved in 
many different kinds of projects. The test, however, 
of the efficiency of education is the degree of success 
with which the pupil carries out projects of life. The 
ultimate tests, therefore, of the real efficiency of educa- 
tion must come outside of the school. Some test, 
though, can and should be made before the pupil is 
passed out of his training courses. 
_ Another angle to the question.—If, then, the mas- 
tery of problems is set up as the goal of education, and 
the carrying out of projects is recognized as the most 
valid test of the adequacy of the attainment of the 
educational goal, the question arises as to whether the 
pupil should first be given practice in dealing with the 
problems just as problems until he seems to have 
mastered them, and then be given the test of carrying 
out a project involving these problems, or can he master 
the problems best through trying to pass the test of 
carrying out a project? That is to say, can a pupil in 
manual training make a library table that will be
-P-A-G-E-191
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 177 
commercially acceptable by doing no other sawing, 
planing, chiseling, etc., than that actually required in 
working with the materials out of which the table is 
actually constructed; or will he have to take time off 
from the project to master the various problems of 
planing, chiseling out a mortise, cutting a tongue, etc., 
before he can safely undertake to do these acts upon 
the valuable materials that are to be used in actual 
construction? Furthermore, if the purpose in making 
a library table is to secure a mastery over these manual 
and constructive problems, and if practice must be 
carried on with other materials not to be used in the 
construction of the table, say just with odds and ends 
of practically worthless scraps, why not carry on the 
study and mastery of the construction problems in- 
volved in manual work in this way, and for the exam- 
ination in the course let each pupil select and carry out 
a suitable project and expect the results of the project 
to meet the commercial standards? 
The answer to these questions is tied up with the 
problem of effective motivation. The supposition has 
been that a pupil will work more zealously to master 
the problems of construction if he works upon them 
as parts of the actual realization of some project in 
which he is interested. The practical fact is that many 
times the undertaking of a project has really discour- 
aged the pupil. He finds that he has so many problems 
to solve and has to take so much time off to master 
them before he can proceed that he loses interest in
-P-A-G-E-192
  | 
178 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the project and, if permitted, he will frequently aban- 
don it. On this account he may be allowed to go on 
with the project too rapidly and he comes out with a 
result that is not satisfactory. An attempt to meet 
this situation has been made through organizing a 
graded series of manual projects that gradually brings 
about a mastery of the fundamental problems of 
manual construction work. 
The place of the project—The project, as just 
stated, is the ultimate test of the adequacy of an educa- 
tion. Therefore an appropriate project should be 
introduced at whatever stage of the course the pupil is 
supposed to have mastered a usable body of problems. 
In order to secure adequate motivation in the mastery 
of the problems, a list of projects should be set forth 
and the pupil should be invited to choose the project 
in which he feels most interest. Then an examination 
of the nature of the project will reveal the problems 
that must be mastered. The pupil can be made to 
realize the amount of time and energy that will be 
involved in mastering the problems, and, if the road 
does not seem too long and arduous, he will attack his 
work with interest and vigor. Then comes the coveted 
opportunity, the test, the carrying out of the project. 
The success of this enterprise turns him toward the 
next list of projects with new zeal. He again selects a 
project, and by examination discovers the problems 
that must be mastered before he can hope to deal with 
it successfully. He sees again that the road to this 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 179 
goal is not too long, and he attacks his work with defi- 
nite purpose and interest. 
The project, then, may be made the starting-point 
in motivating the work of the pupil, but it should sel- 
dom be the starting-point of actual work. The desire 
to realize the project may be made the means of 
realizing the kind of education that is necessary in 
order to satisfy the desire. Then the working with the 
most economical subject-matter material will go for- 
ward with maximum interest, vigor, and efficiency. 
That is to say, the formal material can now be used 
most economically and effectively in bringing about the 
mastery of the vital content material, the mastery of 
which enables the pupil to deal satisfactorily with the 
chosen project. This formal practice material is found, 
in most cases, outside of projects. If one attempts to 
furnish enough formal practice for mastering the prob- 
lems or content subject-matter by dealing with the 
actual projects, he must expect necessarily that the 
plan will be extremely wasteful or he must be satisfied 
with crude results in the completed projects. For 
example, if the pupil makes enough library tables to 
master thoroughly the problems set forth above, he 
must either waste much valuable material or a number 
of very crude tables must be accepted as completed 
projects. | 
A practical difficulty+The practical difficulty that 
teachers meet in attempting to use projects in connec- 
tion with school work is that of securing enough feas-
-P-A-G-E-194
    180 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
ible projects that the pupil will desire so earnestly to 
carry out that he will be willing to pay the price of 
mastering the problems involved. \ That is to say, the 
average adolescent individual has so little vocational 
bent of any sort that mere projects do not interest him. 
Therefore, even to set up desired projects as tests of 
the attainment in the high school subjects is a difficult 
undertaking. Moreover, it is difficult for the adoles- 
cent pupil to maintain his interest until the time 
arrives for turning him loose upon the project as the 
test of his attainment in the particular field of subject- 
matter. 
The relation of the project to vocational guidance. 
—tThe above discussions make the point clear that 
vocational guidance will be furthered most in high 
school through an examination of the nature of in- 
dustrial and professional projects, rather than through 
the carrying out of a limited number of actual projects. 
As has already been suggested in discussing the prob- 
lem of motivation, a course might very well be given 
in vocational guidance that would undertake merely 
to give the necessary information as to what problems 
must be mastered to carry out successfully the projects 
in mechanical engineering, dentistry, journalism, etc. 
The course might appropriately be named “The Nature 
of Industrial and Professional Projects.” 
The relation of the project to the apprentice system 
of education.—The project idea in education is essen- 
tially the old apprentice system. The apprentice
-P-A-G-E-195
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 181 
binds himself to the employer for a period of years in 
order to learn the trade. His education consists in 
doing the things that a green hand can be trusted to 
do under the direction of a master workman, and in 
watching the skilled performance of the skilled workers 
as a helper. After a time he acquires enough knowl- 
edge of certain phases of the skilled performance and is 
given an opportunity to do these phases of the work 
under direction. Gradually he acquires more knowl- 
edge and the required skill to turn out a satisfactory 
commercial product, until finally he has mastered the 
trade through the actual doing of the various acts in 
producing a commercial output. 
The project idea in school work purports to do this 
same thing, namely, to give the pupil the necessary 
knowledge and skill to carry out worth-while projects 
through the actual carrying out of such projects in his 
school work. The fact that the old apprentice system 
broke down and gave way to trade or technical schools, 
which to-day secure the best results through maintain- 
ing a proper balance between formal training in master- 
ing the fundamental problems involved in the par- 
ticular trade and the actual doing of commercial work, 
—that is, the carrying out of genuine projects in the 
field—should be a helpful criterion in deciding the 
place and value of the project in high school subjects. 
The educators who hope to solve most of the diffi- 
culties experienced in attempting to motivate the high 
school subjects through the use of projects should not
-P-A-G-E-196
  182 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
forget that the prospective doctor goes to a medical 
school for the more rapid and more thorough mastery 
of medicine instead of going into a doctor’s office to 
“read medicine,” as was once the practice. The poten- 
tial lawyer goes to a law school instead of into a law- 
yer’s office to “read law.” A future reporter goes to a 
school of journalism to master the newspaper game. 
These professional schools introduce a certain amount 
of actual project work or fictitious project work in their 
courses in order to test the mastery of theories and to 
give necessary skill so that the period of “starvation 
practice” outside of school or the period of partial 
apprenticeship may be shortened as much as possible. 
The amount of real commercial or professional service 
that can be carried on in these schools is necessarily 
limited; hence most of the vital project work must 
come after entrance into the commercial or professional 
field as a competitor in the chosen field. 
The relation of the project to the normal mental 
rhythm of interest—The psychological fact has been 
set forth (in Chapter II) that the interests of an indi- 
vidual sway back and forth between the mastery of 
theory and the putting of the theory into practice. 
The high school pupil may be interested in the prob- 
lems or theoretical material in a given subject for a 
time, and he may work earnestly to master them. 
Soon, however, he tires of too much theory and craves 
the action of practice. The project affords the desired 
opportunity to test the theoretical material. For 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 183 
example, the pupil in manual training may be in- 
terested in learning how to make different kinds of 
joints, in mastering the acts of sawing, planing, etc. 
The time soon comes when he tires of theory and for- 
mal practice and desires to test his mastery of the 
various problems studied by doing a piece of work that 
is commercially valuable. This is the stage at which 
to introduce a proper kind of project as an examination 
or test of the results of the educative process that has 
been going on. Therefore the introduction of the right 
kind and the right number of projects that serve as 
tests of the mastery of the vital content material and 
balance against the tendency to too long storing up 
of content material, and that catch and hold the in- 
terest of the pupil as it sways away from theory so that 
it will sway back again to a desire for more theory, 
is of most vital importance. 
The organization of subject-matter for economical 
memorization._The mastery of subject-matter in any 
field involves the memorizing of considerable data. 
Memorizing needs to be done for two distinct purposes. 
The one purpose is that of getting a sufficient body 
of data before the mind of the learner to enable him 
to select the significant material and to learn the funda- 
mental facts in the particular field.) Therefore in order 
to accomplish this purpose a great amount of tem- 
porary memorizing must be done. Many things need 
to be learned just for to-day, or this week, etc., accord- 
ing to the amount of time it will take for the learner  
-P-A-G-E-198
  184 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
to get the necessary data in mind. As soon as the core 
has been sifted out of this mass of material, all the 
supporting data can sink into the background and 
further attention in memorizing be given only to 
making the worth-while core a permanent possession. 
The second purpose in memorizing is that of making 
important subject-matter a permanent part of the 
learner’s mental make-up. In order to accomplish this 
purpose, the pupil must do a great amount of practising 
or drilling upon this vital material until it is thoroughly 
memorized. The pupil must be taught to overlearn 
this body of material. 
The critical point is that the subject-matter in a 
course should be so organized that the pupil knows 
what material is to be memorized temporarily and 
what material is to be made a permanent possession. 
The organization of the course should provide for 
bringing together the important data that is to be 
permanently mastered and time given to its mastery 
or thorough memorization. The pupil should know 
what to spend arduous hours of effort upon and what 
to pass over rather hastily and lightly as far as memory 
impressions go. The pupil should not be encouraged 
or permitted to waste time and energy in the over- 
learning of temporary material. 
Memorizing by wholes instead of by parts——The 
psychologists have demonstrated that memorizing by 
wholes rather than by parts is more effective and more 
economical. Therefore the subject-matter in each
-P-A-G-E-199
ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 185 
high school subject should be organized into appro- 
priate wholes for economical memorizing. This point 
is true for both the temporary material and the per- 
manent material. The organization of the temporary 
material into appropriate wholes will enable the pupil 
to get the body of data before his mind readily and 
will facilitate the sifting out of the vital material. 
Proper organization of the permanent material into 
wholes will enable the pupil to start the habit path 
of permanent memorization at the very outset, and 
will insure the most rapid development of the habit 
path with each period of practice upon the whole that 
is being learned. 
The important problem.—The vital question in the 
arrangement of subject-matter into wholes for memor- 
izing is as to what constitutes a whole and what con- 
stitutes a part in any particular field of material. This 
question must be answered by a careful consideration 
of the nature of the subject and the purposes for which 
it is being taught, and by a consideration of the mental 
maturity and ability of the pupils who are to study 
the subject. As pupils become more and more mature 
and better trained in memorizing, subject-matter can 
be organized into larger and larger wholes for effective 
memorization. The range of individual differences 
likely to be found in any group of properly graded 
pupils should also be taken into account in this con- 
nection. The wholes undertaken for memorizing 
should not be too long for the least capable individual 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  186 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
nor too small for the most capable. Some pupils will 
necessarily be compelled to drive rather hard while 
others will need to put forth only a minimum of effort 
to accomplish the same piece of work. All in all, the 
problem of determining the appropriate wholes into 
which the subject-matter in any subject should be 
divided for effective learning is a complicated one. No 
two subjects present the same difficulties; hence the 
practical answer to this question must be taken up in 
the application of these principles to the teaching of 
each of the high school subjects. 
Units of human development.—The organization of 
subject-matter, in the light of the foregoing discussion, 
may become a very formal procedure unless the teacher 
is guided constantly by the conception that units of 
mental development are the goals of education. Each 
body of content material must correspond to a unit of 
intellectual grasp, and each body of formal material 
must correspond to a unit of mental habit power. The 
organization of subject-matter materials in the form 
of an inductive problem must have as its goal a gen- 
eralization that is not beyond the unit of concept with 
which the pupil carries on his thinking. Likewise, an 
organization of materials in the form of a deductive 
problem must not undertake to present a general truth 
of such complex relationships that it is not under- 
standable in terms of the unit of concept with which 
the pupil does his thinking, or so complex that it in- 
volves relationships beyond the pupil’s power of
-P-A-G-E-201
  ORGANIZATION OF SUBJECT-MATTER 187 
experience-getting. Every problem and every project 
organization of subject-matter materials must be in 
terms of the unit of concept in thinking, unit of judg- 
ment span, and unit of mental habit power. Memory 
wholes of subject-matter must be determined by the 
unit of mental synthesis that the pupil possesses. 
This point must be kept uppermost all the time; for 
if the teacher loses sight of this main objective in the 
process of educating the pupil by means of the high 
school subjects, the teaching performance will become 
a more or less perfunctory juggling of signs and symbols 
and language expressions that make no educative im- 
pressions. The subject-matter must always be a means 
of promoting the welfare of the pupil, and its value 
must be unmistakable. The teacher should be able to 
make the pupil realize the function of every teachable 
unit of material that he employs in contributing to the 
education of the pupil. 
SUMMARY 
The organization of subject-matter should be deter- 
mined first by the central idea that brought the subject- 
matter into existence. This central idea determines 
the scope of the subject and its divisions and sub- 
divisions. This phase of organization is related to 
the method in the mind of the learner in mastering 
the subject. The subject should also be organized so 
as to provide for a proper balance between the content
-P-A-G-E-202
188 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
and the formal material in the subject. For purposes 
of daily teaching, the subject-matter may be organized 
into a series of inductive problems or into a series 
of deductive problems. According to the nature of 
the subject and the maturity of the pupils, subject- 
matter may be organized into problems or it may be 
arranged into a series of projects. Subject-matter may 
be organized into appropriate wholes for effective 
memorization. 
EXERCISES 
1. Select two high school subjects and show how the cen- 
tral idea that caused each of them to be brought into 
existence determines the divisions and subdivisions 
of the subjects. 
2. Select two high school subjects and give illustrations 
to show the distinction between content and formal 
material in them. Examine one recent text-book in 
each subject chosen and determine how many pages 
in each book are given to content material and how 
many pages to formal material. 
8. Select one high school subject and organize a series of 
three lessons in the form of an induction. Give the 
actual material that you would have the class study 
and the assignment just as you would make it for 
each lesson. 
4. Select one high school subject and organize a series of 
three lessons in the form of a deduction. Give the 
actual material that you would have the class study 
and the assignment just as you would make it for 
each lesson. 
5. What high school subjects can be employed most effec- 
tively in the inductive form of organization? What 
ones in the deductive form?

the various phases of these subjects that you would 
organize under each form. 
7. What high school subjects can be employed best in the 
form of problems? 
8. What high school subjects can be employed best in the 
form of projects? 
9. Select one high ‘school subject and show how the or- 
ganization of the subject-matter into both problems 
and projects may be accomplished so as to balance 
and guide the natural fluctuation of the pupil’s in- 
terest from theory to practice. 
10. Select two projects and give the’details of their organ- 
ization. 
11. Give two or more illustrations of situations in which 
the-pupil lost interest in the project because he lacked 
facts or skill that required taking so much time off 
from the project for their mastery that he tired of 
the undertaking. 
12. Select one high school subject and organize at least two 
wholes that would make memorizing more effective

    CHAPTER VII 
DEVICES 
Definition.—A device is any means, other than the 
subject-matter itself, that is employed by the teacher 
in presenting subject-matter to the mind of the learner. 
This definition sets device off very distinctly from 
method or the psychological procedure of the learner, 
and from the technique of teaching. A device is some- 
thing that is devised or invented to suit the situation. 
The number of devices that may be employed in 
teaching any subject will depend upon the nature of 
the subject and the resourcefulness of the teacher. In 
other words, the devices of teaching may be innumer- 
able; hence to use the term in the plural is correct, 
whereas method should be used only in the singular. 
Classification of devices.—The classification of de- 
vices is necessarily an arbitrary matter, but the making 
of a classification will help one to see clearly the nature 
of devices and to understand better the criteria that 
should guide in their selection. The following classi- 
fication seems to be both practical and inclusive: 
1. Material devices. 
a. General. 
b. Special. 
2. Mental devices. 
a. General. 
b. Special.

  DEVICES 191 
Material devices.—A material device is one the form 
of which has no significance or bearing upon the 
subject-matter presented. A blackboard, for example, 
is a material device. It is a very helpful means of 
getting subject-matter presented to a number of pupils 
simultaneously. Its form, however, has no relation to 
any kind of subject-matter that may be presented upon 
it; hence it may be employed in any subject. -The 
blackboard is also a general material device for the 
reason that has just been given. A projector is another 
example of a general material device. It may be used 
in any subject, and its form has no relation to any kind 
of subject-matter presented by means of it. 
A special material device is one that can be used to 
advantage only in particular subjects or in particular 
phases of the same subject. A series of lantern-slides 
in physiology, for example, is a special material device. 
These slides can not be used to much advantage in any 
other subject, and the material of the slides has no 
relation to the subject-matter presented. A relief map 
in geography is a special material device. 
The field of general material devices has been well 
covered by manufacturers of school apparatus and 
supplies. The field of special material devices has 
also been covered to a considerable extent. There is 
plenty of room, however, for the ambitious and re- 
sourceful teacher to devise and invent many devices in 
the special field. The success of the teacher will be 
conditioned to a considerable degree by the ability he
-P-A-G-E-206
  192 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
has in inventing effective special devices for use in 
teaching his particular lines of work. 
Mental devices.—A mental device is one that is 
related in form and meaning to the subject-matter 
being presented. Questions, for example, are mental 
devices. The form of the question is related to the 
subject-matter presented by means of the questions. 
That is to say, thinking the ideas involved in under- 
standing the questions is thinking part of the ideas 
involved in the answers to the questions. This fact 
has caused many people to think of questions as a 
method of teaching instead of as a device or means 
of teaching. The learner does not learn in a question- 
ing manner, but he learns by means of questions. 
Questions are not mental processes, but they are the 
means of arousing mental processes. 
Questions are a general mental device. That is to 
say, questions may be used in any and all subjects as 
a means of presenting subject-matter. This fact makes 
it important for the teacher to study carefully the 
different types of questions that may be employed. 
The teacher can then select the best types for any 
particular phase of subject-matter, according to the 
purposes for which the subject-matter is being pre- 
sented. 
Types of questions—The most common type of 
question is that which calls for information. The pupil 
merely needs to know certain facts in order to answer 
the information-seeking question. A second type of
-P-A-G-E-207
  DEVICES 193 
question is that which raises a problem or demands an 
evaluation of facts. If the question is asked, Who is 
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court? a mere state- 
ment of the man’s name is all that is required. If, 
however, the question is asked, Why should the Indian 
be given full citizenship? an evaluation of certain facts 
must be made in order to answer the question intel- 
ligently. If the question is asked, How can the Indian 
be made a full citizen? a problem is raised that de- 
mands the consideration of many facts before a satis- 
factory solution can be reached. 
Other general mental devices.—Correlations are a 
general mental device. That is to say, every subject 
may be presented to some extent by means of its rela- 
tion to other subjects. The geographical fact of the 
location of Philadelphia is related to the historical 
events that happened in and around that place; hence 
the presentation of these historical facts may be accom- 
plished most effectively by employing their geograph- 
ical correlations. 
The lecture is another example of a general mental 
device. Many people think of the lecture as a method 
of teaching, but it is not a mental procedure. The 
lecture is a means of awakening the mental procedure 
of learning. Thinking the ideas involved in the lecture, 
however, is thinking many of the ideas involved in 
learning the subject-matter presented by means of the 
lecture; hence the lecture is a mental device. 
The special mental device.—A special mental device 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
ER re een ee Tey eee ey Sa CE ae 
194 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
is one that can be used to advantage only in certain 
subjects or in certain phases of the same subject. A 
mnemonic system for memorizing a particular body 
of facts is a special mental device. A series of de- 
velopmental questions adapted to a certain phase of 
subject-matter is a special mental device. A unique 
type of correlation would be a special mental device. 
The criteria governing the selection of devices.— 
The wise selection and effective use of devices involves 
a careful consideration of certain criteria. These cri- 
teria serve to keep the fundamental issue in teaching 
uppermost in the mind of the teacher, namely, the fact 
that what goes on in the mind of the learner is what 
educates him. That is to say, the mental processes 
of the learner and what is happening to the mental 
habits of the learner must never be forgotten in think- 
ing about devices. Therefore the teacher will do well 
to get the following suggestions clearly in mind: 
1. A device should always be a helpful means to the 
pupil in learning the particular subject-matter pre- 
sented. That is to say, the device should not become 
a task that takes the attention of the pupil from the 
very facts it is supposed to help him learn. This is 
a most vital criterion, and every device should be very 
critically considered from the standpoint of actual 
helpfulness before it is employed by the teacher. The 
idea will be more clearly kept in mind if the teacher 
thinks of the device as a device of learning rather than 
a device of teaching.  
-P-A-G-E-209
  DEVICES 195 
A second important idea in connection with this cri- 
terion is the fact that a device may be very helpful 
to one pupil and be of little or no help to another pupil. 
In fact, a device may be a hindrance to one pupil and 
a great help to another. The teacher should center his 
attention upon the learning process of each pupil as 
he attempts to use the device as an aid to learning. 
If he is able to analyze the mental procedure of the 
pupil, he will be able to see what part the device really 
plays in furthering or hindering the educative process. 
2. Devices should be adapted to meet the individual 
needs of pupils. This criterion is related to the first 
one and merely emphasizes the idea that the use of 
any device should not become a requirement in a 
course. If any pupil does not find a particular device 
to be helpful to him in learning the things that are 
presented in the subject, then he should not be required 
to employ that device. The pupil should be willing 
to try out the suggested device and he should give it 
a fair and faithful trial; but when he has made a 
reasonable effort to use the device and declares that it 
is not helpful to him, his verdict should be accepted 
and different devices tried until he is helped by means 
of the device or devices employed. 
3. Devices should be numerous enough to permit of 
selection on the part of the pupil or to permit of selec- 
tion on the part of the teacher as he discovers their 
helpfulness or lack of helpfulness. This criterion is 
related to the first two criteria, and it emphasizes the 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  196 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
idea that the teacher should not trust too much to the 
use of a few supposedly excellent devices. The teacher 
should be resourceful and alert to invent a wide range 
of devices from which spontaneous selection can be 
made in the face of the teaching situation. : 
4, Devices should not be too numerous. No pupil 
should be asked to employ so many varied devices that 
he is confused instead of helped. Likewise, the teacher 
should not attempt to use so many devices that he 
confuses the pupil by their multiplicity and rapid 
changes. This point demands critical judgment on the 
part of the teacher. He should use a sufficient number 
of devices to enable him to help every pupil, and yet 
he should avoid confusing any pupil by using so many 
that the pupil is more aware of the devices than he is 
of the things they are intended to help him to learn. 
5. Devices should be economical. The chief idea 
in considering their economy is that of the cost in 
money, time, and energy in preparation and employ- 
ment. This idea, however, must include the considera- 
tion of the results that are secured through the use of 
the device. A still further point in considering 
economy is that of the length of time it may be used 
after it has been well prepared. A device that secures 
excellent results and that can be used for a relatively 
long period of time is economical, even though its first 
cost be comparatively high. The special apparatus 
used in the sciences, lantern-slides used in history,
-P-A-G-E-211
  DEVICES 197 
literature, sciences, etc., are good examples of really 
economical devices. 
A very important point in connection with this con- 
sideration of economy is that of continuing to employ 
good devices that are effective and economical. Many 
teachers clamor for this or that device because it seems 
to be the popular one at that particular time, and then 
after securing it soon cease to employ it and begin to 
clamor for something supposedly more up to date and 
modern. This idea does not mean that teachers should 
continue to use a device if it really ceases to be effec- 
tive and economical, but it does mean that expensive 
devices ought not to be employed for a short time and 
then be cast aside or neglected. For example, a certain 
teacher wanted a series of stereopticon views with a 
sufficient number of stereopticons to use the views in 
history classes. The entire outfit was secured, and the 
teacher used them enthusiastically for a short time, 
with excellent results. Soon, however, he became tired 
of managing their use, and employed them less and less 
frequently until finally they were not used at all. The 
outfit was still good and, what is more to the point, 
it could have been used effectively always in the teach- 
ing of certain periods of history. The trouble was that 
the device became commonplace and the teacher al- 
lowed its use to be neglected. 
6. Devices should not be mere novelties. That is 
to say, they should not attract attention to themselves 
because of the novelty of their form or use. They 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  198 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
should be so helpful that their forms are lost in the 
concentration of attention upon the facts that are to be 
learned. This does not exclude the idea that novel 
forms may be the best means of securing concentrated 
and prolonged attention upon the i i that 
is to be learned. It does mean, however, that devices 
should not be employed because they entertain the 
pupils by their novelty. This point is one that should 
be studied critically in the use of visual education. 
The moving picture, for example, may be highly edu- 
cative or it may be merely a highly entertaining device 
that accomplishes very little in the way of genuine 
education. | 
The fundamental idea just set forth is that devices 
should increase the interest of the learner in the sub- 
ject-matter that he is studying by helping him to 
master it more readily. The more interested the 
learner becomes in the subject-matter, the less atten- 
tion will he give to the form of devices that are 
employed in presenting the subject-matter. There- 
fore they should be effective means of making subject- 
matter more interesting. 
7. Devices should be usable. The main idea in this 
connection is that they should be of such a character 
that they can be kept in usable condition without 
taking too much time and energy in order to keep 
them ready for use. Another idea of usability is that 
of the length of time they will last without losing any 
of their effectiveness. Devices that are always getting
-P-A-G-E-213
  DEVICES 199 
out of order are not usable in the sense that usability 
is employed here. Those that last but a short time 
are not usable as the term is herein used. On the 
other hand, those that last a long time without requir- 
ing much attention to keep them in effective working 
order are the most usable, provided that other con- 
siderations are equal. 
8. Devices should be adapted to the subject-matter 
and to the goals that are to be secured through the 
mastery of the subject-matter. A device may be very 
helpful in one subject, but be of very little help when 
employed in another subject. The note-book is a good 
example of this point. The making of a note-book in 
science may be a help or it may be a hindrance. A 
note-book in history may be a very poor device and 
it may even be a distraction to the pupil. The teachers 
have been prone to catch up this and that device that 
they have seen employed in this and that subject and 
to attempt to use these devices in other subjects. The 
difficulty with this performance usually is that no cri- 
teria are set up for determining the validity of such a 
choice of devices. The result is that the teacher fre- 
quently does not realize that the failure to secure satis- 
factory results by means of the device is due to its not 
being adapted to the subject, and concludes that the 
pupil does not want to work or that the pupil is in- 
capable of doing the work satisfactorily. 
There is an important point involved in this con- 
nection, namely, that teachers should not get the idea 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    200 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
that the employment of any device is a means of 
making the course “stiffer.” For example, the making 
of note-books in a science course does not make the 
course “stiffer” than it would be without their employ- 
ment. The traditional use of the note-book in science 
work, however, has tended to give the idea that unless 
they are required the course is of lower standard. On 
the other hand, the idea should hold that if any device 
is adapted to a subject it will enable the pupil to master 
that subject with less difficulty than he would otherwise 
experience in his study of that subject. In other words, 
the devices have no bearing upon the standard of the 
course, but they merely help to determine the readiness 
with which the pupil masters the subject to the degree 
that he meets the standards of attainment set up and 
secures the standard of development or education that 
is desired. The “stiffness,” then, of a course is de- 
pendent upon the nature of the goals set up and the 
nature of the subject-matter employed, and not upon 
the devices or means that may be employed in dealing 
with subject-matter in attaining these goals. 
Devices should be used with discrimination—The 
teacher should always use good judgment and discrim- 
ination in the employment of devices. The black- 
board, for example, has been used so much in certain 
subjects that the teacher takes it for granted that it 
is the most effective device that can be employed. 
Teachers in high school who deal with mathematics 
as a means of educating the pupil think the board is
-P-A-G-E-215
  DEVICES 201 
so essential that they are lost without a large amount 
of blackboard space. In fact, they usually want 
enough to have every pupil in the class working at the 
board at the same time. Little do they realize how 
much time they waste in using the blackboard for the 
whole class. Teachers of languages likewise are apt to 
feel the loss of the blackboard very keenly. 
These lines of work especially demand a great 
amount of drill, and blackboard drill is supposed to be 
the most efficient means of conducting such drills. The 
result is that the teacher not infrequently keeps the 
whole class standing during the entire period of forty- 
five or fifty minutes. Standing at the board is very 
fatiguing and the mental alertness of the pupil is 
dissipated by his bad posture and physical discomfort. 
Moreover, the position at the board is bad for vision, 
since very little of the board surface is in the proper 
relation to the position of the eyes for easy vision. 
Mental confusion and errors often result from poor 
visualization due to the improper relation of the eyes 
to the surface of the blackboard and the physical strain 
of trying to stoop low enough or stretch high enough 
to write the data involved in the work. 
Again, many pupils have poor vision and do not see 
well the material that is written upon the board. The 
result is that they get hazy ideas when they should be 
getting clear conceptions. Then, when the teacher 
holds them responsible for the materials and thinks 
that the use of the board has given every one an equal 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  202 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
chance to acquire the data thus presented, the pupil 
often fails. The teacher feels aggrieved and blames 
the result upon the pupil’s indifference and inattention. 
Sometimes the teacher is harshly critical, and the pupil 
resents the cutting criticisms that, in his judgment, are 
unjust. The whole difficulty is due to the fact that 
the teacher used a traditional device without sharply 
discriminating between its supposed efficacy and the 
actual physical conditions and factors that invalidated 
the results. 
The critical point, then, is that the teacher should 
study all of the conditions and factors that will neces- 
sarily be involved in the use of a particular device and 
thus acquire the.knowledge and insight that will enable 
him to use it discriminatingly. In other words, he 
must constantly be alert to discover the actual results 
that are being produced in the mind of the learner as 
the outcome, and intelligently adapt his technique of 
handling the situation to the overcoming of the defects 
of the conditions under which the work is being done. 
SUMMARY 
A device may be defined as any means, other than 
subject-matter itself, that the teacher employs in the 
presentation of subject-matter. The classifying of de- 
vices helps one to see the real nature of devices. All 
devices are material or mental and they are also gen- 
eral or special. The teacher should be guided in his

selection of devices by the following criteria: helpful- 
ness to pupils; adaptability to individual needs; 
numerous enough to permit selection, but not nu- 
merous enough to be confusing; economy; not mere 
novelties; usability; adaptability to subject-matter 
and to goals to be attained. The teacher should use 
devices discriminatingly.

  CHAPTER VIII 
MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF 
TEACHING 
The starting-point—The starting-point, in the 
undertaking of measuring the results of teaching, 
should be the present status of the pupil with regard 
to the types of development that are to be secured by 
means of the subject-matter. The teacher can not 
determine accurately just how much he has contributed 
to the education of the pupil if he does not know 
definitely and accurately the actual educational status 
of the pupil at the outset of his teaching enterprise. 
Therefore the very first thing to do is to measure the 
pupil instead of assigning him a lesson. This may be 
done through the employment of a well planned exer- 
cise or series of exercises, which may be either formal 
or informal or both. These exercises should be so 
designed and used as to discover the type of mind the 
pupil possesses, the extent of his unit of concept in 
interpretation and expression, his habits and facilities 
for memorization of facts, and his mental equipment 
of concepts and facts in the field of subject-matter 
that is to be employed in his further education. 
The time necessary for accomplishing this task of 
205

  206 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
arriving at a definite understanding of the present edu- 
cational status of each pupil is comparable to the 
amount of time required for making an accurate meas- 
urement of the status of the pupil at the close of the 
time that the pupil is under the charge of the teacher. 
The course of study should be organized with this idea 
in mind and ample provision should be made for 
making this initial measurement thorough. 
One of the most enlightening things for the pupil 
would be to know his real educational status before 
he begins to work with material that may take him 
farther along the road to maturity and mental effi- 
ciency. The possibility of securing an effective degree 
of motivation would be greatly enhanced by showing 
the pupil the possibility of the growth that may be 
secured by means of the subject-matter in a particular 
field. Moreover, the pupil will be helped in getting 
the point of view that education is not merely a get- 
ting of lessons and passing of quizzes, but that it is a 
matter of furthering certain phases of his mental ma- 
turity by means of lessons and possibly by means of 
quizzes. That is to say, the pupil may be made to 
realize what the means of growth may be, and also to 
understand the valid types of evidence that show what 
actual growth he has made. 
The teacher is usually in too much of a hurry to 
assign lessons, and as a result overshoots the mark at 
the outset. This overshooting of the mark discourages 
many pupils and causes them to drop out of the class
-P-A-G-E-221
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 207 
unless they are arbitrarily compelled to remain in it. 
The teacher in this case has his eyes upon the “ground 
to be covered,” and the time seems all too short for 
traveling the distance; hence he says “Let’s go,” and 
steps on the accelerator with the word “go.” The 
important point is not just “go,” but it is rather the 
question of “go” from where to where in terms of 
educational development of the pupil. The teacher 
should not be too severely criticized, however, if he is 
held responsible for the administration of a certain set 
course of subject-matter. He may not have much 
choice in the matter, but must live up to the “tradi- 
tions” of the old idea of “teaching the subject.” 
The fallacy of rushing into lessons without knowing 
the status of the pupil first may be seen clearly by 
comparing the teaching situation with the situation in 
which the physician is called in to treat a case of 
physical illness. The physician takes time carefully 
to diagnose the case. He feels the patient’s pulse; 
notes his respiration; looks at his tongue, throat, and 
eyes; takes his blood-pressure; takes his temperature; 
makes a blood-test; makes a urinalysis. Then, after 
comparing the results of all these tests and observa- 
tions with the characteristic symptoms of this and that 
disease, he makes his prescription of medicine and 
orders the course of nursing that, in his judgment, 
should be administered to restore the patient to health. 
Now, if he were to follow the usual procedure of the 
teacher, the first step in his treatment would be to
-P-A-G-E-222
    208 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
give the patient a pill, and, if he survived that one, 
proceed to give him a bigger and more tasteful one, or 
perhaps the second dose might be a capsule or a tablet. 
Then, after he had pilled and capsuled and tableted 
and dosed his patient with a certain unit or quantity 
of dope, he would proceed to examine the patient to 
see whether he was daring to continue to be ill after 
such generous medical treatment. 
The physician who followed any such course of pro- 
cedure would be branded at once as a “quack,” merely 
seeking an opportunity to present his bill. He says, 
“Take a pill, pay my bill, and be well.” If such a 
doctor is a “quack,” what should the dispenser of 
mental pills be called who begins giving lesson doses 
without first diagnosing the condition of the patient to 
learn what he needs and in what form it can best be 
administered? Whatever name might seem appro- 
priate to designate the performer, such procedure on 
the part of the teacher is certainly an asinine per- 
formance. 
Setting up goals.—The next step, after measuring 
and establishing the educational status of the pupil, is 
that of setting up goals of development toward which 
the pupil should progress consistently by means of the 
subject-matter presented in the course. If the pupil 
possesses the encyclopedic type of mind, the problem 
of growth is that of developing the power to construct 
thought unities out of masses of discrete facts. If the 
pupil possesses the synthetic type of mind, the problem
-P-A-G-E-223
         MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 209 
of growth is that of developing the habit of careful 
analysis of the large generalization with which his 
mind is satisfied to deal. The pupil may possess both 
the ability to construct thought unities out of discrete 
facts and the ability to break a large obvious unity 
down into its supporting details. In this case the pupil 
needs balanced training in both practices. The ques- 
tion is, how can the subject-matter in this particular 
field be made to contribute vitally to these various 
phases of mental growth? 
A second goal is that of the extended unit of concept 
in thinking. This goal has two aspects. The one 
aspect is the unit of concept in interpreting printed 
material. The other aspect is the unit of concept in 
expressing the individual’s own ideas. These two 
aspects of this goal should be so definite and tangible 
that the pupil may be able to recognize the degree of 
growth involved in progressing toward the goal. Then 
the problem of how the subject-matter of the course 
may be so organized as to contribute definitely to the 
attainment of the goal can be settled with intelligence. 
The solution of this problem involves the setting up 
of the intermediary steps that must be taken in order 
to progress from the present status of the concept of 
thinking to the ultimate status desired. 
A third goal is that of the habit of memorizing and 
the facility with which it functions in the particular 
field of subject-matter. The pupil may need to change 
entirely his habit of memorizing, and he may need to
-P-A-G-E-224
  210 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
learn how to employ helpful devices that will greatly 
increase the efficiency of his habit in dealing with the 
particular body of subject-matter. Then the problem 
of organizing the subject-matter that should be mem- 
orized for any purpose and for any length of time can 
be definitely worked out. The setting up of the inter- 
mediary steps that lead toward the final attainment of 
the desired goal will enable the teacher to set up the 
appropriate units or wholes that may be most effec- 
tively memorized as wholes rather than by parts. 
A fourth goal, which is closely related to the third 
goal, is that of defining the exact body of facts that 
are worth remembering permanently. The pupil 
should have a clear idea of this goal at the outset, and 
he should be made to see the connection between the 
habits of memorization desired and the attainment of 
this goal. He should also know the kinds of tests that 
will help in establishing the real status of his mental 
attainment in mastering the facts that are worth while 
making a permanent possession. The absolute value 
of the facts so memorized can not be too greatly 
emphasized. Mere memory-juggling of facts is not 
education from the standpoint of any of the phases of 
maturity desired. If the pupil recognizes the value 
of the body of facts that are to be thoroughly mem- 
orized and if he really desires to memorize these facts, 
he will welcome the right kind of tests that will show 
him what progress he has made and what he still 
needs to do to secure a satisfactory result.
-P-A-G-E-225
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 211 
Evidences of development.—The next important 
step after measuring the present educational status of 
the pupil, and after setting up the goals toward which 
he is to progress by means of the subject-matter em- 
ployed in the particular course, is that of deciding 
upon the kinds of evidence that should be taken into 
account in determining the status of the pupil, not 
only at the end of the time during which the subject- 
matter has been dealt with, but also all along the road 
from the beginning to the end. The ultimate measure- 
ments must be made by means of the same tests that 
were used at the outset or by means of tests that are 
similar in character. That is to say, the tests that 
measure the unit of concept in thinking, for example, 
may be so comprehensive and standardized that the 
pupil will not be able to pass the upper ranges of the 
test until he has passed through experiences and train- 
ing to be derived from working with subject-matter 
materials that are expressed in sentence units of grad- 
ually increasing difficulty, and has actually reached 
the higher stage of maturity of the larger mental 
habit. Therefore the very same test materials that 
were used in the initial measurements may very well 
be employed at the end of the course. It may be 
better, however, to employ new sentences of the same 
degree of complexity and of the same kinds of structure 
as were employed in the original tests. 
The most valid evidences, then, of the growth made 
in the various types of maturity that really signify
-P-A-G-E-226
TR Ee: ee CL ee 
212 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
education of the individual are the scores that he 
makes on these standardized tests. That is to say, the 
best kind of measurement that can be employed in 
determining the growth of a habit is a standardized 
piece of work that demands the use of the particular 
habit to a satisfactory degree of efficiency. If the 
distance between the present status of the pupil and 
the goal set up to be attained by the end of the course 
is very great, the teacher needs to employ a series of 
standardized pieces of work or tests that are graded 
according to the series of actual stages of growth or 
habit formation that must be passed through in order 
to reach the ultimate goal. If tests of this character 
are not in existence, they must be devised before the 
teacher can do any worth-while measuring of the actual 
education that is being secured in the mind of the 
pupil. There is very great need for this kind of work 
or test material in connection with virtually every 
high school subject. 
The danger that must be guarded against in working 
out standard tests is the danger of making them 
subject-matter tests instead of mental-maturity tests. 
There is a place and a need for carefully constructed 
subject-matter tests that will measure the mental con- 
tent of the pupil’s mind to determine the actual stock 
of facts, ideas, concepts, definitions, rules, laws, and 
principles that he possesses; but it requires an entirely 
different kind of test to determine the maturity of 
mental habits that must function if he is to employ 
~ 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 213 
this mental content to the best advantage. Take 
history, for example. The pupil may by virtue of a 
good memory for historical data and by good habits of 
practice in memorizing acquire a vast store or mental 
content of more or less discrete historical facts; but 
because he lacks mental maturity of his unit of concept 
in thinking and has not developed his span of judg- 
ment, he can not employ his mental content either in 
the interpretation of complex political problems or in 
the development of constructive political theories in 
his own attempts to deal with large questions. In 
other words, a pupil may be long on mental content of 
facts and yet be short on mental content of mature 
habits of thinking, or vice versa. The function of the 
teacher who employs history subject-matter in the edu- 
cation of the pupil is to secure a balanced development 
of both kinds of content. Therefore in order to meas- 
ure the results of his teaching he must have standards 
that are adapted accurately to determine the status of 
the pupil’s mind in respect to each and every type of 
growth and development that is specifically sought 
through the use of historical subject-matter. 
Tests serve two purposes.—The teacher has two 
distinct problems to solve. First, he must discover the 
actual status of the pupil’s attamment. Second, he 
must discover why the pupil does not attain the stand- 
ards or goals of development desired. The tendency 
has been to employ standard tests for the purpose of 
discovering what is and what is not, and to stop at that 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  214 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
point. Little attempt has been made thus far to devise 
tests that will disclose the nature of the intermediary 
steps necessary to bring about a higher stage of devel- 
opment. Likewise, little has been done in the way of 
definite tests that measure the status of the minor 
steps and intermediary habits that gradually build up 
the higher stage of development desired. Such tests 
are essential in order that the teacher may determine 
why the pupil does not measure up to the standard, 
and in order that the teacher may determine the exact 
place along the road at which the pupil has arrived. 
That is to say, the teacher needs to employ tests for 
the purpose of diagnosing the progress of the pupil 
from day to day. The teacher needs to know what is 
going on in the mind of the pupil to-day, to-morrow, 
the next day, and to know in what direction the inter- 
mediary daily performances of the pupil are building. 
There is great need to-day in the high school for well 
devised tests that will enable the teacher to diagnose 
the learning performances of the pupil. There is like- 
wise need for well established tests for measuring the 
ultimate attainments of the high school pupil. 
The nature of a diagnosis.—The difference between 
employing tests as a means of diagnosis and as a means 
of measuring the status of attainment according to an 
established standard may be seen from the following 
illustration. The pupil in typewriting is given a speed 
test of the standard type. He should make a certain 
score to be commercially efficient. Suppose this score
-P-A-G-E-229
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 215 
is seventy-five words a minute. The results of the 
test show that he made a score of only fifty words a 
minute. This result shows that the pupil has not 
attained commercial efficiency, but it does not show 
why he has failed to attain the desired degree of effi- 
ciency. Therefore a number of tests should be em- 
ployed that will discover the status of the various 
factors that determine the success or failure of the 
pupil in attaining the desired goal. 
One very important factor in this case is that of 
visual acuity. The pupil may not see the words of the 
copy clearly, and on account of the effort involved in 
trying to see accurately enough to avoid making serious 
errors his speed in writing is greatly diminished. Tests 
of the pupil’s visual acuity will determine readily the 
degree to which this factor furthers or hinders his 
writing skill. The testing, however, should be thor- 
oughly done by means of standard visual tests. 
Another important factor in typewriting skill is that 
of the reaction time of the pupil. The pupil may be 
lacking in facility to respond to the stimulus of the 
seen words. The pupil may see the words clearly 
enough and without visual strain, but the time that it 
takes him to release the motor impulses involved in 
making the appropriate movements in writing the 
words may be so long that his writing speed is mate- 
rially reduced. Therefore reaction tests that are ap- 
propriate to the typewriting situation should be em- 
ployed to discover the part that the reaction time of
-P-A-G-E-230
  216 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the pupil plays in attaining or failing to attain the 
desired standard of speed. 
Another factor in typewriting skill is that of the 
spelling habit or efficiency of the pupil. The pupil 
may be so inaccurate in his spelling that he must take 
note of the exact form of each word instead of merely 
seeing the word as a whole and trusting his spelling 
habit to give him the correct form. That is to say, he 
must take time to visualize the letters of the words 
instead of seeing them as word unities the ideas or 
names of which are familiar. If the pupil has an effi- 
cient spelling habit for each word in the material 
copied, he will take less time for his work than he will 
take if his spelling habit is not reliable. The use of 
spelling tests will determine the degree to which this 
factor enters into the accounting for failure or success 
in attaining typewriting skill. 
Another factor in the typewriting situation is that of 
the degree to which the pupil has mastered the key- 
board of the machine. If the pupil has not thoroughly 
mastered the key-board, his speed may be greatly 
reduced because of momentary hesitations to get posi- 
tion or to release the correct impulse to this or that 
finger. There may not be any particular tests applica- 
ble in this case other than the usual writing exercises. 
The employment of these exercises as tests, and care- 
ful observation of the pupil’s reactions as he writes 
regular copy and introspective analyses made by the 
pupil himself, should enable the teacher to determine
-P-A-G-E-231
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 217 
to a fair degree the extent to which lack of mastery 
over the key-board enters into the pupil’s failure to 
attain the desired speed of writing. 
Another factor that has a decided effect upon the 
pupil’s efficiency in speed of typewriting is the degree 
of self-consciousness that enters into the situation. 
The pupil may be so self-conscious under the condi- 
tions of taking the speed test that, as a result, he 
injects too much of voluntary attention to parts of the 
performance that should be trusted entirely to habit. 
That is to say, the pupil may reduce his speed in 
writing by inhibiting motor habits through fearing to 
trust them wholly and unreservedly. A number of 
speed tests that are taken by the pupil without his 
being aware of the fact that they are being taken for 
the purpose may be the means of establishing the 
extent to which the self-consciousness of the pupil 
hinders his skill in typewriting. 
Standard tests in speed of typewriting, then, merely 
show the score. They measure the efficiency of the 
total habit of writing upon the typewriter. Other 
tests, which should be standardized as fully as possible, 
are necessary to diagnose the status of the various 
factors, intermediary steps, and habits that must func- 
tion adequately in order for the total or larger habit to 
be efficient. The diagnosis discovers the weak and 
strong factors and enables the pupil to work more in- 
telligently toward the mastery of the desired degree of 
efficiency. 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
218 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
A critical point—The fundamental point in the 
problem of working out and using tests for the purpose 
of measuring attainment and for the purpose of diag- 
nosing the learning situation is that these two uses of 
tests should be used as balances the one against the 
other in determining the function and range or scope 
of subject-matter. That is to say, the use of tests for 
purposes of diagnosis will determine the actual reasons 
for failure to make progress. The establishment of 
the reasons why the pupil makes only a limited amount 
of progress within a certain period of time is to a 
degree a prognosis of the possibility of his making 
progress within such a period of time, such as a quar- 
ter, semester, or year. Once this fact has been estab- 
lished, the attainment that should be considered as 
standard can be determined and appropriate tests de- 
vised for measuring the ultimate results of the pupil’s 
efforts. The goal of attainment that was supposed to 
be attainable by the end of a semester may need to be 
pushed ahead to the end of the year, and the goal that 
was supposed to be reached by the end of the year may 
need to be pushed ahead a half-year or even a whole 
year. 
For example, one might set up as a goal in French 
the unit of concept in interpreting and expressing com- 
plex sentences that would contain all of the elements 
of speech that are ordinarily employed. Standard 
tests could then be devised and employed in deter- 
mining whether or not the pupil has attained the de-
-P-A-G-E-233
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 219 
sired goal. The use of the standard tests, however, 
will not show whether or not it is possible for the pupil 
to attain the goal within the given period. That is to 
say, the score made on the standard tests is not a 
sufficient diagnosis of the learning situation. There- 
fore other tests must be used as a means of diagnosing 
the scores made and in determining what the unit of 
concept should be that is attainable within the given 
period. If the teacher always looks to the units of 
human maturing for guidance in setting up the goals 
of attainment, and if he employs tests for diagnoses as 
well as for standard measurements, he will not only be 
able to “get over the ground,” but he will be able to get 
the ground over. 
A caution.—The teacher must not confuse the use 
of standardized tests of mental maturity with stand- 
ardized tests of mental skill. For example, the Courtis 
arithmetic tests are largely tests of speed and accu- 
racy in carrying on the fundamental number operations 
and they set the degrees of attainment that should be 
reached in the different grades. They do not, how- 
ever, measure the types of mental maturity set forth 
above. Such tests are highly valuable for the exact 
purposes for which they have been devised, but the 
results secured from them should not be taken as a 
measure of these other desired goals. The various 
scales that have been devised are almost, if not wholly, 
means of measuring skills rather than means of meas- 
uring degrees of mental development. None of these 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
220 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
tests or scales are usable for purposes of accurate 
diagnoses; hence they tend to fasten attention upon 
the teaching of subject-matter, rather than centering it 
upon the teaching of the pupil. 
The plateau of the learning curve and tests.—The 
work of Swift, Byran, Harter, and others has estab- 
lished the fact that the progress of learning reaches a 
plateau where no progress seems to be made for some 
time. Then the curve rises rather abruptly and con- 
tinues to rise until another plateau is reached. The 
use of standardized tests will determine these plateaus, 
but they will not disclose the nature of the acts nor 
the progress that is going on at the plateau level that 
enables the learner to make the next advance to a 
higher level. It is just as important, if not more im- 
portant, to know what is going on at the plateau level 
as it is to test the status of the total habit or skill. 
Therefore tests for purposes of diagnosis must be 
brought in at this point and carefully administered, in 
order that the minor steps that build into the larger 
or higher order habit may be carried on until the 
results of their mastery will function adequately. That 
is to say, only very accurate diagnostic tests can deter- 
mine why the plateau exists and what is necessary to 
end its existence and to raise the habit to a higher level 
of efficiency. 
The technique of measuring the results of teaching. 
—The problem of selecting the technique that will 
prove most effective in measuring the results of teach- 
?
-P-A-G-E-235
SE Rae AOR PEE IN PIE PT UR Pa (mand RIEL See ROSEN SES SADDER EY SDE See 
MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 221 
ing is a vital one, and involves first of all setting off 
clearly from each other the two uses of tests suggested 
in the foregoing discussion. That is to say, the teacher 
must decide when and how to employ diagnostic tests 
and when and how to administer standard tests. The 
following suggestions may be helpful in solving this 
problem. 
First of all, the teacher should abandon the time- 
honored custom of counting so much for class work, 
so much for note-book (if it is a course in which a 
note-book is employed as a device), so much for 
quizzes, and so much for examinations. The adding 
together of these various items and dividing by two, 
three, or whatever the number of items may be is not 
a scientific procedure in testing the results of teaching. 
Such a procedure means that the teacher has no defi- 
nite units of mental development set up as the goals 
to be attained by means of presenting the subject- 
matter of the particular course. It leaves out of con- 
sideration the fundamental issue, which is the deter- 
mining of the ultimate status of each kind of habit or 
mental content that the study of the subject should 
bring to the pupil. The important point is not how 
many blunders and how much struggle and stress the 
pupil passed through on the road from where each type 
of mental development was at the beginning of the 
course to the present status at the end of the course, 
but what is the exact status of each such mental habit 
or mental content at the end of the course. The im-  
-P-A-G-E-236
    222 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
portant point is not whether the pupil has made the 
real growth and development that is finally measured 
by being in school every day or only a part of the time, 
whether he accomplished it in a short time or a longer 
time, whether he grew by means of certain devices or 
by other more individualistic means, but how much 
growth he actually has attained. If the goals have 
been rightly placed in the light of the progress revealed 
through careful diagnoses, then the only ultimate 
measure is the score of the pupil in the standardized 
performances. 
The results of the diagnoses or tests used for diag- 
nostic purposes should not be a part of the final reck- 
oning. Their function, as already has been pointed 
out, is to aid in rightly placing the goals and standards 
of achievement that are reasonably possible within a 
given period of time, and to guide the teacher in know- 
ing what is going on in the pupil’s mind as he takes the 
necessary intermediary steps toward the final goal. 
The giving of tests for diagnostic purposes, then, is 
for guidance in teaching and for the enlightenment of 
the learner. Therefore these tests should be made fre- 
quently. The reactions of the pupils during the teach- 
ing period are, in fact, largely diagnostic material. 
When the pupil makes an error, the teacher needs to 
apply diagnostic tests to discover why the pupil made 
the error and how to direct the thinking of the pupil in 
building up a correct reaction in place of the incorrect 
one. The asking of questions in the development of a
-P-A-G-E-237
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 223 
problem, the use of drill materials, the employment of 
review, all are forms of diagnostic tests. Therefore the 
evaluation of the reactions of the pupil during the reci- 
tation or teaching periods should not be taken as a 
part of the final evaluation of the growth made by the 
pupil. 
It is a good point in technique to give frequent short 
quizzes or tests that help the teacher to check up on 
the development of the small habits that are to be built 
gradually into the larger habit or skill. The pupil, 
however, should know the purpose of these tests and 
should be made to realize how they indicate progress 
toward the final goal. 
It is likewise a good point in technique to use both 
oral and written tests for the purpose of diagnosing 
what goes on in the pupil’s mind. Some pupils possess 
the ability to express their mental habits through oral 
speech, but are not able to do themselves justice when 
compelled to give their reactions in writing. On the 
other hand, many pupils can express their mental 
habits and reactions much more effectively by means 
of writing than they can by means of oral speech. 
The important point in regard to the giving of diag- 
nostic tests is that they should be carefully selected 
and frequently given. If this practice is followed the 
pupils will not be in doubt as to the development they 
are making day after day, and they will not have the 
impression, as they so frequently do, that they are 
getting along, or, as they put it, “passing,” when they  
-P-A-G-E-238
  224 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
are not really growing and developing toward the ulti- 
mate goal. 
Technique in giving standard tests.—The funda- 
mental point, in reference to the giving of standard or 
final tests for the purpose of measuring the actual 
status of development of any specific form of mental 
maturity, is that the pupil should be given a number 
of these tests and the average of the scores be taken as 
the final estimate of his standing. That is to say, the 
same principle should be applied here that is applied 
in working out the standardized test itself. No test 
can be considered as a standard that is not the repre- 
sentative measure of a very large number of cases. 
Likewise, no one score should be taken as the measure 
of an individual, but the average of a number of 
scores should be computed as the representative score. 
This point needs especial emphasis, for there has 
been too great a tendency to take the results of one 
trial on a standard test as the ultimate measure. This 
has been particularly true in the giving of intelligence 
tests. As a result, very serious errors have been made 
in sending to subnormal groups pupils who should 
never have been taken from their regular groups. Like- 
wise, many pupils have been “flunked” on final exami- 
nations and ruthlessly denied the privilege of a second 
trial. Even in the case of a memory test of the mental 
content of facts possessed by the pupil, a number of 
tests should be given and averaged, instead of taking
-P-A-G-E-239
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 225 
the result of a single ten- or fifteen-question exami- 
nation. 
A second item of good technique in the giving of 
standardized tests is that of making the pupil thor- 
oughly acquainted with the nature of the tests as early 
as possible in the course. That is to say, the pupil 
should never be in doubt as to exactly what the stand- 
ards are that he will be expected to measure up to at 
the end of the time during which the course is taken. 
Even in the case of facts that are to be memorized, the 
pupil should know just what these facts are and just 
the way in which the final testing will be done. Take 
language, for example. If the pupil is expected to 
memorize a thousand words, he should have the list of 
one thousand words at the very beginning of the under- 
taking. If, in history, a hundred or two hundred or 
any particular number of events is to be memorized, 
the pupil should know at the beginning just what 
these events are and the exact way in which the tests 
will be given. It should be an open and aboveboard 
measure of a definite development, and nothing vital 
should be omitted and nothing unimportant should be 
injected. Moreover, there should not be differences of 
opinion as to what is important and what is not valu- 
able enough for permanent mastery. 
Negative aspect of testing.—One of the important 
aspects of testing the results of teaching is that of dis- 
covering what the pupil can not do. This phase of 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  226 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
measuring should receive very special attention in the 
technique of giving diagnostic tests. A pupil ought not 
to spend a whole semester in discovering that he can 
not master the intermediary steps that would enable 
him to pass the final standard test. If a pupil is per- 
mitted to spend a semester, or even a year, in working 
faithfully and conscientiously with any field of subject- 
matter, and as a result does not attain the goals set up 
and attained by his fellows, he should be given credit 
and no disgrace should be attached to his inability to 
profit by means of the subject-matter dealt with. How- 
ever, the employment of valid diagnostic tests over a 
limited period of time should enable such a pupil to be 
changed to some other line of work that might be bet- 
ter adapted to educating him to a desired positive de- 
gree. The social standing and the privilege of gradu- 
ating ought not to be denied the faithful, conscientious 
pupil who has spent a semester or a year in learning 
what he can not do and what developments he can not 
make by means of certain fields of subject-matter. 
Negative credit should be just as respectable as positive 
credit and just as acceptable in meeting the require- 
ments for the social function of graduation. 
The assigning of marks.—The assigning of marks 
or credit grades is one of the most difficult and unsatis- 
factory phases of measuring the results ‘of teaching. 
The difficulties can be overcome largely by working 
out the reasonable standards or goals that all normal 
pupils can attain by proper reasonable effort under the
-P-A-G-E-241
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 227 
guidance of a skilled teacher. Then the average score 
of a number of trials will be the measure of attain- 
ment. If this average is equal to or above the goal set, 
then the credit should be positive and marked satis- 
factory. Such a plan would do away with the ranking 
of scores on a scale of A, B, C, D, ete., and it would 
discontinue the use of the probability curve in dis- 
tributing grades. The probability is that it is an un- 
safe device based upon a fallacy, as far as measuring 
the results of teaching in any single class is concerned. 
In the first place, the group is entirely too small, and 
in the second place it is supposed to be a selected and 
not a random group. Therefore no one in a class 
ought to be doomed to fail or be “flunked” by the em- 
ployment of the probability curve. Any pupil in type- 
writing, for example, who attains the standard speed 
of, say, seventy-five words a minute should be counted 
satisfactory, regardless of how much above the mark 
other pupils go in mastering the skill. That is to say, 
here is a standard of a practical, usable kind that is the 
goal, and not what one pupil does as compared with 
another. The standard score or norms should be the 
modal score or the average score of thousands of cases, 
and the score of any individual should be compared 
with this standard. 
SUMMARY 
The starting-point in undertaking to measure the 
results of teaching should be the status of the pupil at 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  228 | TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS { 
the beginning of the course. The more definitely this 
status is established at the outset, the more exactly 
the results of the teaching can be measured in the end. 
Not only the status of the pupil at the beginning 
should be definitely known, but also definite goals of 
attainment should be set up as the ultimate status to 
be reached by the end of the course. Definite evi- 
dences of development should be decided and tests de- 
vised for securing these evidences. Tests for two pur- 
poses are needed, namely, standard tests that measure 
attainment, and diagnostic tests that show what is 
lacking in the training of the pupil who does not make 
a satisfactory score on the standard tests. The check- 
ing against each other of the use of tests to determine 
standards of attainment and the use of tests for pur- 
poses of diagnosis will enable the teacher more accu- 
rately to set up attainable goals of development for 
definite periods of time and to adapt subject-matter 
to securing their attainment. 
Standard tests of mental maturity and tests of 
mental skill should not be confused with each other. 
The right use of diagnostic tests and standard tests 
will do away with the traditional custom of counting so 
much for class work, so much for quizzes, etc. The 
ultimate standing of the pupil should be determined 
by the score he makes on the standard tests. The 
final score that is taken as the measure of the pupil’s 
development should be the average of a number of
-P-A-G-E-243
  MEASUREMENT OF THE RESULTS OF TEACHING 229 
scores made upon a number of trials on the standard 
tests. 
Pupils should become acquainted as early as possible 
with the nature of the standard tests and the types of 
development that they are supposed to attain during 
a course. Attention should be given to the negative 
findings disclosed by diagnostic tests and by standard 
tests. Graduation credit should be given the individual 
who works faithfully and by his effort discovers what 
he can not do effectively. The use of diagnostic and 
standard tests will simplify the problem of assigning 
marks or grades to pupils. The modal score or average 
score of several thousand cases should be the norm 
with which to compare the score of any individual.

CHAPTER Ix 
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 
Technique defined.—The term technique is used 
here to mean the acts put forth by the teacher in 
presenting subject-matter to the pupil. The technique 
of the teacher is not merely the acts themselves, but 
also the skill or quality of the acts put forth in pre- 
senting the subject-matter to the pupil. In fact, tech- 
nique might very well be defined as the skill of the 
teacher in carrying on the acts of teaching. This idea 
of technique is clearly distinct from the method of 
learning, and is also sharply defined from the devices 
employed in teaching. Technique is related, however, 
to both the method of learning and the devices em- 
ployed; hence technique may be defined as the skill of 
the teacher in manipulating the devices so that the 
psychological processes carried on by the learner are 
stimulated to effective reactions in dealing with the 
subject-matter that is to be learned. 
The pedagogical sequence.'The teacher must first 
know what mental processes should be carried on 
within the fundamental movement of the mind in 
attempting to master the subject-matter presented. In 
the second place,the teacher must decide upon the 
231 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
    232 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
devices that will be most effective in presenting the 
subject-matter. Last of all/*the teacher must decide 
what acts to put forth and the manner or quality of 
putting them forth in employing the devices effec- 
tively. This order of thinking through each teaching 
problem should become habit, and may very well be 
termed the pedagogical sequence of good teaching. 
This pedagogical sequence emphasizes the psychlog- 
ical processes of the learner as the starting-point and 
the basis for determining the selection of both the 
devices and the technique of teaching. This emphasis 
will be the chief factor in bringing about improvement 
and refinement in the process of teaching. That is to 
say, the ultimate improvement in teaching rests upon 
the refinement of the technique that is practised by 
the teacher. The refinement of technique, however, 
can be brought about only by pointing every act that 
the teacher puts forth in teaching to the stimulating 
and directing of the psychological processes that the 
learner must carry on in order to master the subject- 
matter presented. Therefore, the more the teacher 
gives attention first to determining definitely the men- 
tal processes of the learner in dealing with each phase 
of subject-matter presented, the more will he con- 
sciously select his technique in the light of the effect it 
will have upon the learning performance of the pupil. 
Criteria that govern the selection of technique.— 
E teacher may be greatly aided in selecting his tech- 
ique by setting up a series of important considerations
-P-A-G-E-247
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 233 
as a guide in determining what his practices will be. 
The following principles are a valid basis for such 
practical selection of technique. 
1. Every act of technique should be selected on the 
basis of its direct effect upon some essential phase of 
the learner’s performance in learning. That is to say, 
the technique of the teacher will be good or bad as it 
has a good or bad effect upon the mental processes 
carried on by the learner in dealing with the subject- 
matter presented to him. The chief basis for deter- 
mining the effect that any particular act of technique 
will be likely to have upon a particular mental process 
involved in the learning performance must necessarily 
be the experiences of the teacher in securing satisfac- 
tory results in similar learning situations in the partic- 
ular field of subject-matter. 
2. (Every act of technique should be selected on the 
basis of the naturalness with which the teacher can 
employ if) That is to say, a teacher can not use any 
act of technique effectively unless that act is natural 
and easy for the teacher to perform. This point does 
not exclude the idea that a teacher may be able, 
through conscious drill and faithful effort, to render 
acts of technique that at first are awkward and un- 
natural for him perfectly natural and easy. It does 
mean, however, that the teacher should not attempt to 
practise acts of technique just because he has seen 
some highly skilled teacher employ them, when these 
acts are absolutely foreign to his nature and type of 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  234 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
personality. The teacher should study his own nature 
and should know his weaknesses and limitations. 
Then he should form the habit of intelligent and fear- 
less self-criticism, and he should not undertake to 
practise technique that is so foreign to his nature that 
he is not likely ever to master it to the degree in which 
it becomes easy and natural. 
On the other hand, the teacher should not. be too 
hasty in deciding that he can not render natural to 
himself practices in technique that he sees expert 
teachers employ effectively. He should analyze these 
acts of technique and the learning performance to 
which they seem adapted, and study the whole situa- 
tion carefully with a view to giving these phases of 
technique a thoroughgoing, unprejudiced trial. In 
other words, the teacher should not allow himself to 
become prejudiced against any particular act or set of 
acts of technique. On the contrary, he must keep his 
mind open and free to accept or reject acts of tech- 
nique, according to the results secured by faithful at- 
tempts to master them. 
8. Many acts of technique should be selected ac- 
cording to the nature of the device employed in the 
particular teaching situation) Many a well selected 
and excellent device has failed to prove effective be- 
cause of the faulty technique practised in using it. The 
teacher must study the devices selected in each case in 
order to adapt his technique to the manipulation of 
the devices in such a way as to render their use most
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 235 
effective. In other words, the technique of the teacher 
will be effective only as it reaches and affects the 
learning performance of the pupil through well se- 
lected and adapted devices. 
4, The acts of technique should be selected accord- 
ing to the nature and maturity of the pupil or the 
class upon whom they are practised. An act of tech- 
nique may not be equally effective with all pupils in 
the group, and the technique that works well with one 
group may not work effectively with another group. 
An act of technique may be just the thing with fresh- 
men, but wholly ineffective with seniors. Again, an 
act of technique may be well received by girls and yet 
be entirely lost upon boys. The teacher must be alert 
to discover the reactions of the pupils and to adapt his 
technique to meet the varying characteristics and ten- 
dencies of the extreme ranges of individual differences 
found among adolescent boys and girls. 
5. Acts of technique should be selected according 
to the nature of the subject-matter. The presentation 
of content subject-matter requires a different tech- 
nique from the technique that is effective in presenting 
formal material in the same subject. Likewise, the 
technique that proves effective in dealing with mathe- 
matics may not be suited to the presentation of lan- 
guage material; and science, history, sociology, etc., 
may require still different adaptations of technique to 
render their presentation effective. Therefore the 
teacher must study the relation of any particular act 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  236 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of technique to the particular body of subject-matter 
that is to be presented. 
The critical point in this connection is that of the 
purposes for which the subject is being taught. The 
technique practised must be related to these purposes 
in such a degree as to insure their most effective and 
complete realization. Hence the teacher must look 
through the nature of the subject to the purposes for 
which it is being taught, and he must adapt his tech- 
nique to fit the nature of the subject and to accom- 
plish the purposes. 
6. The acts of technique should be selected accord- 
ing to the length of time occupied by the teaching 
period. A short period will require a different sort of 
practice from that which is best adapted for a long 
period. This point is also tied up with the immediate 
purposes of the teaching period. If the teaching period 
is for the purpose of review, drill, or the presentation 
of new material, the technique practised must be dif- 
ferent, even though the length of time be the same in 
each case. 
7. Technique should be selected according to the 
environment of the class-room. The physical condi- 
tions under which the teaching is carried on may be so 
widely different in many cases that the technique 
practised in even the same subject and for the same 
purposes will have to be greatly modified in order to 
secure satisfactory results. Not only the environment
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 237 
of the class-room, but also the environment of the 
school building and even the environment of the school 
site, may need the most careful consideration in de- 
termining the most effective technique to practise. 
Rules governing the use of technique.—1l. No act 
of technique should ever become an end in itself. 
That is to say, the teacher should never have his atten- 
tion centered upon his technique to the extent that his 
chief concern is showing off his performance. In other 
words, it should never distract the attention of the 
pupil from the mastery of the subject-matter pre- 
sented. The learning performance of the pupil should 
hold the center of the stage at all times, and the tech- 
nique of the teacher should be inconspicuous. As a 
rule, the more the technique of the teacher is in evi- 
dence the less effective it is, and vice versa. 
2. No act of technique is in itself good or bad, but 
each is good or bad according to the effect it produces 
in each particular situation. The act that is effective 
at one time in one situation may not be effective at 
another time in another situation. The teacher must 
constantly adapt his technique to the securing of the 
desired results in each teaching situation. Some acts 
of technique are in general good, while others are in 
general bad or faulty. The very fact, however, that 
some are generally good while others are generally bad 
makes it all the more necessary for the teacher to use 
such acts with careful discrimination, in order that the
-P-A-G-E-252
  238 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
act that is generally good may not be used when it will 
not be effective, and in order that the act that is gen- 
erally bad may be used when it will be effective. 
Technique adapted to devices.—Certain devices are 
so much used in all teaching that some general sug- 
gestions concerning the technique that is in general 
effective with these devices may be helpful. These 
points should be taken merely as suggestions, how- 
ever, and the teacher should be alert to discover when 
and how to modify the technique in using these and 
all other devices in teaching. 
1. Technique in asking questions.—Every teacher 
will employ questions in teaching any subject. There- 
fore every teacher should study the art of questioning 
and seek to attain a high degree of skill in using this 
device. The first point to keep in mind is that of the 
“method of the learner.” The teacher must first de- 
termine what it is that he wishes to present to the mind 
of the learner. Second, he must determine what kind 
of question to ask in order to put the subject-matter 
before the mind of the learner as a vague whole. Then 
he must decide how to break up the large question or 
whole into smaller questions or wholes so that the 
progress of analysis will be carried on effectively. 
Lastly, he must determine the form of the question or 
questions that will enable the pupil to put the answers 
to the detailed questions of analysis together into a 
synthetic answer to the one large question with which 
he started his learning performance. In other words,
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 239 
the teacher should organize his questions on the basis 
of their relation to the unity presented and on the 
basis of their effectiveness in stimulating the mental 
processes of the learner in dealing with this unity. 
A second important point is that of the number of 
questions asked in the presentation of a particular 
unity. The number of questions must not be too 
small, for that may mean that the pupil deals always 
with such large parts of the larger unity that he can not 
analyze the larger unity into a sufficient number of 
supporting details. On the other hand, the number of 
questions should not be too large, for that may mean 
that the pupil will always be dealing with such small 
fragments of the larger unity that he can not construct: 
the synthesis or larger unity out of these fragments. 
A third point that is closely related to the number 
of questions asked is that of the speed with which 
questions are asked. If questions are asked too rap- 
idly, not enough time is given for the pupil to deter- 
mine as to the answers. Moreover, the pupil may not 
even analyze the questions if they are asked too rap+ 
idly. The pupil must have time for this analysis and 
for getting the problem clearly presented to his mind 
before he can do any intelligent thinking in the direc- 
tion of constructing the correct answer. Too many 
questions result in snap judgments, guessing at the 
answers, and fragmentary thinking. The number of 
questions and the speed with which they are asked 
should be determined by the purpose. If it is memory
-P-A-G-E-254
    240 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
drill, many rapid questions may be just the kind of 
technique that is most effective. The pupil should be 
expected to answer from memory, and he should be 
alert to speed up his memory process of recall in sup- 
plying the needed data spontaneously. If, however, 
the purpose is to develop constructive thinking about a 
problem, rapid questioning is apt to be confusing. The 
teacher needs to do careful thinking before questioning 
the pupil, hence he can not employ a large number of 
rapid-fire questions. Moreover, the pupil must have 
time to analyze the question and to think out the 
answer before another question is asked. 
The critical point in this connection is the fact that 
too frequently the teacher does not have clear unities 
of subject-matter in mind when asking questions. 
Hence he asks enough questions to bring the main 
body of facts before the mind of the pupil in relatively 
small fragments. The result is the asking of many 
questions that leave the subject-matter presented in 
little isolated groups of facts. If these facts ever be- 
come fused into the construction of the significance of 
the unity to which they belong, it will be because some 
happy situation brings the right questions to the mind 
of the pupil and stimulates him to construct his ideas 
into the unity of thought that enables him to meet 
the situation. That is to say, a large part of the ques- 
tioning that is done by teachers is spontaneous and 
haphazard. This means that the results are ineffective 
learning of worth-while subject-matter.
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 241 
Another important consideration in determining the 
technique of effective questioning is that of when the 
teacher should prepare his list of questions to be used 
in the presentation of a particular phase of subject- 
matter. This point is closely related to the point just 
set forth, that the teacher too frequently does not have 
in mind a clear unit of significance to which to point 
all his questions. The first step, then, is the setting up 
of this unit of meaning that is to be presented. Then 
the teacher must take stock of the pupil’s background 
of experience as best he can, and decide what questions 
will be most helpful to the pupil in bringing his expe- 
rience to bear upon the solution of the large question 
or problem. Such a procedure demands deliberation 
on the part of the teacher; hence he needs to prepare 
a list of constructive, codrdinated questions that will 
lead the pupil through a clear analysis and synthesis of 
the unit of meaning that the pupil is to learn. If the 
teacher practises this habit of careful preparation of his 
questions before he undertakes to present the problem 
to the pupil, he will soon become skilled in asking con- 
structive questions. 
Only a very experienced and expert teacher can ask 
spontaneously questions that will be adapted to the 
mental equipment of the pupil and also be codrdinated 
so as to set up a unit of meaning as a more or less 
vague whole, lead the pupil to analyze it, and reor- 
ganize his answers into a synthetic answer to the large 
question or problem. Moreover, the teacher who is
-P-A-G-E-256
  242 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
equipped with a carefully thought out list of questions, 
if alert to the teaching situation, is prepared to expand 
the list or to cut it down as the reactions of the pupil 
indicate the necessity for more minute analysis or for 
less minute breaking up of the large question or prob- 
lem. The writing out of a list of questions beforehand 
will not make the teacher bookish or mechanical in his 
presentation of subject-matter. It is the thinking of 
isolated groups of facts and the asking of questions 
that test the pupil’s memory for these isolated groups 
of facts that make the teacher bookish. Likewise, the 
asking of a set of questions set down in a book at the 
close of a section or a chapter may or may not be a book- 
ish, mechanical performance. If the list of questions 
so compiled is a coherent analysis and synthesis of a 
unit of meaning, and if the teacher recognizes the unit 
as organized by the list of questions, the teacher will 
use these questions in such a way as to develop the 
thinking out of the significance that is embodied in the 
list. He will supplement the list or omit from it, as 
the constructive thinking of the pupil demands. If, 
however, the list of questions is constructed to demand 
merely the memory of facts presented in the section or 
chapter, as the case may be, the use of the list will be 
bookish and mechanical. 
The critical point is that the teacher must see to it 
that he uses questions that are organized around a unit 
of meaning that is significant. He must either con-
-P-A-G-E-257
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 243 
struct such a list of codrdinate questions, or he must 
see that the lists furnished are so organized. The criti- 
cal facts certainly support the argument that the safest 
road to the development of effective and reliable tech- 
nique in questioning is to prepare a definite list of 
questions before going before the pupil to present the 
problem that he is to master. 
Another important item in the technique of ques- 
tioning is that of the language. The question should 
be stated as directly as possible and in words that are 
understood by the pupil. The statement must not be 
so complex, so involved, that the pupil at once has a 
difficult problem of sentence analysis to solve before 
he can get its significance. New or unfamiliar words 
should not be employed in questions, no matter how 
direct and simple they otherwise may be. The pupil 
should acquire vocabulary at other times and in other 
ways. Of course, this does not mean that a helpful 
word, although new, may not be introduced in a ques- 
tion, provided the teacher explains its meaning clearly 
and is sure that the pupil is helped rather than hin- 
dered by the enlargement of his vocabulary at that 
particular time. 
Another point in the technique is that of the form 
of the question. The idea before expressed, that no act 
of technique is in itself good or bad, should be kept in 
mind in this connection; but certain forms of questions 
are in general good, while certain other forms are in 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  244 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
general bad. No matter what the purpose of the 
teacher is, as a rule the following forms of questions 
are not effective: 
A. The question that answers itself. For example, 
the teacher in civics may say, “The United States is a 
nation; is it not?” This form of question, which indé-- 
cates the answer, is used frequently by teachers, and 
leads to poor preparation and mere acquiescence in- 
stead of alert thinking. Moreover, it shows lack of 
definite constructive thinking on the part of the 
teacher. That is to say, he is not thinking about the 
learning performance as directed toward a specific goal. 
As arule such a question indicates that the teacher is 
trying to get over so much ground or subject-matter, 
and has lost the vital point, which is to get subject- 
matter over instead of getting over subject-matter. 
There is a vast difference between these two proposi- 
tions. The teacher too frequently sees the course in a 
subject as so much material to be gone over. The 
main objective in teaching any course should be the 
getting of subject-matter over into the mind of the 
pupil in such a way as to bring about real development 
and mental maturity. In other words, it is the matter 
of keeping the “method of learning” constantly in the 
foreground. 
B. The question that can be answered by “yes” or 
“no.” This form is used to a great extent, and many 
times it may be effective. This type of question, how- 
ever, tends to encourage guessing on the part of the
-P-A-G-E-259
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 245 
pupil, and many times the teacher unconsciously gives 
the clue to the answer by some slight change of facial 
expression or by some other movement that suggests 
to the pupil the correct answer. The most critical 
point, however, is the fact that such questions indicate 
the lack of a definite objective on the part of the 
teacher. The teacher who has a definite unit of sig- 
nificance to present to the pupil will seldom need to 
ask a question that calls for the answer “yes” or “no.” 
The questions, in such a case, will be of such a charac- 
ter that they will demand the thinking that should go 
on in the pupil’s mind in order for him to be able to 
answer “yes” or “no” intelligently. 
These two forms are probably the most frequently 
used of any of the objectionable forms. Just as they 
are considered to be generally bad, so the following 
forms are thought to be generally good. 
A. The question that calls for a definite piece of 
information, or the “factual” question. The teacher 
needs to know what bodies of facts the pupil really ° 
possesses in order that he may guide and direct the 
pupil in making use of the facts to best advantage. 
Therefore he must ask many questions that begin with 
“what,” “where,” “when,” etc. The chief point to keep 
in mind is that their use should in most cases be merely 
the preparation for the consideration of worth-while 
problems that will demand the employment of the 
facts involved in the answers of the “factual” questions 
in the working out of their solutions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  246 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
B. The evaluating question. This type of question 
usually begins with “why,” “how,” etc. It demands 
the weighing and evaluating of data for the solution of 
some vital problem or issue. This form of question 
requires reflective and constructive thinking on the 
part of both the teacher and the pupil. The evalu- 
ating question can not be formulated as easily as other 
forms of questions; hence especial preparation is neces- 
sary before the teacher undertakes the presentation of 
material for this purpose. This type of question is 
most constructive and most educative. It is related to 
the ultimate outcome of education; for facts, after all, 
are not worth much unless one is able to evaluate them 
in the light of their usefulness in meeting vital human 
needs. Therefore the evaluating questions should be 
the final type used in the presentation of virtually 
every subject in the high school. 
A further consideration in determining the most 
[sae practice in the technique of questioning is 
that of asking the question before or after naming the 
pupil who is to answer the question. In general, the 
best effect is secured by asking the question and wait- 
ing a sufficient length of time for careful thought on 
the part of the pupils before naming the one who is to 
answer it. There are times, however, when the best 
effect, for the particular pupil at least, is secured by 
naming the pupil who is to answer and then stating 
the question. This is especially true in the case of 
slow pupils, and sometimes in the case of very timid
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 247 
pupils. The timid pupil is often unable to answer a 
question when he is suddenly named after the question 
has been asked; whereas if he is named first he may 
recover from his confusion through giving attention to 
the question. This will not always be true, however, 
and the teacher must study the tendencies of each 
pupil and his individual reactions to be able to de- 
termine just what practice to follow. Therefore as a 
rule he should address questions to the class and watch 
individual reactions to the questions. ' 
2. Technique in Spice: Tee a Uses the 
lecture device to some extent; hence the technique of 
lecturing should be carefully worked out and thor- 
oughly mastered. The important point that should be 
kept constantly in mind is that the use of the lecture 
device should be an economical and effective means of 
stimulating the mind of the learner.to carry on the 
general mental movement of learning. ) The mind first 
sees a thing as a whole; hence.-the“first step in the 
lecture should be that of giving the class a brief sum- 
mary outline or sketch of the general points and or- 
ganization of the lecture. That is to say, get the large 
issue or problem before the class, so that the pupils 
will see the large thought whole or synthesis. The 
large points thus codrdinately presented become the 
framework upon which the supporting and clarifying 
details can be readily and effectively built. 
The second step in the lecture should be the taking 
up of each large point in turn, and working out the
-P-A-G-E-262
248 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
analysis into the most minute details that are essential 
in making clear the significance or meaning of the 
large idea. It is a good rule in technique to give the 
class an outline of the analytical point before giving 
the illustrative discussion or argument that will estab- 
lish its coherence and relation to the larger unity. In 
fact, this step is really a repetition of the first step. 
The only real difference is that each analytical point 
is one of the large codrdinate points of the entire lec- 
ture theme. This smaller unity is first analyzed and 
outlined into its largest codrdinate points, just as the 
larger theme was analyzed and outlined into its largest 
topics or codrdinate ideas, and then the explanations 
and supporting discussions can be built more readily 
and effectively upon this mental framework. 
The third step in the lecture should be the building 
in of the detailed ideas and facts that will complete 
the thought fabric that has been gradually woven by 
setting up the mental warps of large ideas and finally 
filling in the woof of supporting details. The lecture 
now takes up each of the smaller points in turn in the 
outline of the larger points, and amply illustrates and 
discusses it. The final point in technique in connec- 
tion with this step in lecturing should be the sum- 
marizing of the qualifying discussions into a brief 
coherent thought unity that expresses the significance 
of the large point or topic. 
The last step in the lecture should be the giving of a 
/ summary of the smaller summaries, so that the pupils
-P-A-G-E-263
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 249 
have a clearly defined thought whole of the lecture 
theme, with sufficient qualifications to give it vital sig- 
nificance. The first statement of the theme and the 
analyzing down into its fundamental outline of co- 
ordinate ideas is presenting the skeleton of the thought 
being whose structure and meaning is to be learned. 
The other steps are, in the analogy, the building in of 
the fleshy parts of the whole thought being. The final 
summaries that culminate in the grand summary of 
the lecture theme are the presenting of an X-ray 
thought picture that gives clearly the vital significance 
of the skeletal unity surrounded by the fleshy details of 
facts and ideas. 
The effectiveness of the lecture may be greatly in- 
creased through the use of other devices, such as 
charts, drawings, graphs, maps, and apparatus of vari- 
ous kinds, according to the nature of the subject- 
matter under consideration. Whenever the teacher 
plans to use such devices, it is a good point in technique 
to have all devices fully prepared and conveniently 
arranged for use at the proper time. When apparatus 
or mechanical devices of any sort are to be used, the 
teacher should test them near enough to the time of 
the lecture to know that they will work satisfactorily. 
Another important item in connection with the 
using of mechanical or physical devices during a lec- 
ture is that of making sure that every member of the 
class can see easily the data or subject-matter thus 
presented. This point requires careful planning be-  
-P-A-G-E-264
  250 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
forehand and careful consideration of individual diffi- 
culties of pupils and the handicaps of the actual class- 
room conditions and equipments. 
Another item of good technique is that of always 
standing or sitting in a commanding position, so that 
every member of the class can see and hear the speaker 
clearly and distinctly. The teacher should consider the 
individual difficulties of pupils in respect to vision and 
audition in carrying out this point of technique. 
This will require attention to the modulation of the 
speaker’s voice and careful regulation of the force of 
utterance according to the size of the room and the 
size of the class. The acoustic properties of the room 
should also be taken into consideration in order to 
secure the best results by overcoming environmental 
handicaps through good technique of vocalization. 
It is an item of good technique for the lecturer to 
face the entire class as much as possible and to study 
the individual members carefully enough to catch the 
various physical reactions and facial expressions that 
indicate attention or lack of interest on the part of the 
pupils. Practice in making such spontaneous analyses 
of the reactions of pupils will in time develop a con- 
siderable degree of skill and accuracy in interpreting 
the responses of the different individuals in the class. 
Skill in this form of technique will often save the 
teacher from talking too much over the heads of his 
listeners, or from talking down to them too much and 
thus boring and disgusting them. Again, it will enable
-P-A-G-E-265
       THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 251 
the lecturer to discover the points at which some of the 
class may find difficulty in following the discussion. 
The teacher can pause, when such a condition is ap- 
parent, and ask for questions or give further illustra- 
tions of the same points. Unless this point is carefully 
watched, the teacher may do a great deal of talking 
without accomplishing worth-while results. The 
speaker should never forget that lecturing is merely a 
device and that it must constantly be adapted to meet 
the varying factors that enter into the teaching situ- 
ation. 
The final point in the technique of lecturing is that 
of instructing and guiding the pupils in the taking of 
notes on the lecture. The pupils should know just 
what the practice of the teacher will be in lecturing. 
This will enable them to take down the introductory 
outlines in complete form and also to take down the 
X-ray summaries virtually as given. The pupils are 
thus free to give concentrated attention to the illustra- 
tions and discussions that are employed to develop the 
coherence of the introductory outline of points and to 
build the summaries into a definite structure for per- 
manent mastery. The teacher should adapt the rate of 
speaking to the note-taking periods and to the purely 
listening periods. A little team-work between teacher 
and class will soon develop an understanding that will 
render the results vastly more effective than they could 
otherwise be. 
It is often a good form of technique to require the   
-P-A-G-E-266
  252 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
pupils to hand in their notes at the close of the lecture. 
If the teacher is giving a series of lecture discussions, 
this point may be modified by having the notes handed 
in at the end of each week, at the end of the discus- 
sions over a certain part of the series, or at the end of 
the series of lectures. The effectiveness of this prac- 
tice will depend upon the nature of the subject-matter 
being presented in the lecture, and particularly upon 
the maturity of the pupils and the training and prac- 
tice they have had in taking notes on lectures. The 
teacher must always remember that the notes are a 
device that should help the pupils in mastering the 
subject-matter in such a way as to develop definite 
habits and stages of intellectual development. There- 
fore the technique practised must not violate any fun- 
damental principles that should guide in the use of a 
device. That is to say, the teacher should not require 
the taking of notes and handing them in at stated 
periods as a part of the work upon which the pupils 
are to be graded. The notes should be a means of 
enabling the teacher to study the development that he 
is trying to secure in the pupils, but he should have 
tests of the final results of his teaching that are 
independent of any device employed in attempting to 
secure the results. VV 
3. Technique in the use of text-books.—The most 
common device in all teaching is the text-book. The 
text-book is a very economical and effective device
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 253 
when rightly used, but its use may be greatly abused 
by the unskilled teacher. A course in a subject is too 
often the study of a book rather than the study of a 
field of problems. The teacher assigns lessons out of 
the book instead of assigning problems and then giving 
the pupil information as to where he can find helpful 
material in the text-book. The teacher should first of 
all set up in his own mind the field of problems and the 
purposes for which they will be employed in teaching 
the high school pupils. Then he will be in a position 
to examine text-books critically and to determine their 
value as devices in aiding the pupils in their study of 
the problems. Then the teacher should form definite 
habits of examining and using text-books. 
The first habit should be that of examining the text- 
book very thoroughly before making an assignment 
from it. This examination should give the teacher 
first of all a mastery of the author’s point of view and 
the organization of the subject-matter. This is essen- 
tial, for unless the teacher knows the point of view of 
the author he will not know whether the pupil will be 
helped or confused by going to the text for material on 
his study assignments. The teacher should not only 
know the author’s point of view and the organization 
of the subject-matter materials contained in the book, 
but he should also evaluate carefully the materials of 
the book in the light of the purposes for which the 
field of subject-matter is being employed in teaching. 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  254 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
This evaluation will enable him to determine the real 
usability of the book as an economical and effective 
device. 
A second habit should be that of giving very definite 
and specific instructions to the pupils on the use of the 
text as an aid in preparing study assignments. This 
involves a consideration of the mechanics of organiza- 
tion that the author has employed and the best way 
in which to capitalize the work of the author so as to 
save time and energy for the pupils. An important 
point in this connection is the fact that frequently a 
text-book contains a great amount of material that is 
not valuable or helpful to the high school pupils. 
Therefore it is a good point in technique for the teacher 
to mark for the class at the beginning of the course, or 
at the beginning of the study of any large problem or 
division of the course, all material that is not important 
and that need not be considered. 
A third habit that the teacher should form is that of 
determining carefully just what use to make of the 
text-book during the active teaching period. The 
practice that is most effective will vary in the different 
subjects and also in the same subject, according to the 
purposes of the teacher, the size of the class, the other 
devices that are available, and the physical situation 
in the class-room. Just what practice is best at any 
time may be decided definitely by following the sug- 
gestions of the following principles. 
First, the text-book should be a means of directing
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 255 
the attention of the entire class to the same problem 
simultaneously. Second, the text-book should be the 
most economical means of putting relevant material 
into the hands of all the members of the class simul- 
taneously for the solution of a problem. Third, the 
text may be the most economical means for verifying 
results that have been worked out by the class as a 
whole and by individual members of the group. 
Fourth, the text may be a source of materials for drill 
in the first stages of the development of a skill. Fifth, 
the text may be a very efficient means of review when 
the purpose is to give a new point of view on problems 
that have been presented. That is to say, the text 
may be the means of getting the particular body of 
subject-matter readily before the pupil in order that 
his attention can be directed without loss of time and 
at no great expenditure of energy to the new point of 
view that is desired. 
If these principles can be carried out more econom- 
ically and effectively in some other way, then the text- 
book should not be employed during the recitation 
period. For example, in a language class where trans- 
lation and grammatical analysis are being emphasized, 
the material might all be put upon the blackboard at 
the beginning of the period by having each pupil write 
a short part of it in its proper order. Then the books 
should be closed and all should give attention to each 
part as it is taken up for translation, working out of 
constructions, etc. This practice enables the teacher
-P-A-G-E-270
  256 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
to go forward with constructive study, and prevents 
the pupil who is unprepared from trying to make a 
hasty and fragmentary preparation during the process 
of the teaching period. The effect upon the prepara- 
tion of the pupil will soon be apparent, for it will 
induce getting ready for something to be done with the 
aid of the teacher, that the study for the teaching 
period was not expected to enable the pupil to do alone. 
The text-book can and should be used just as freely 
in the class in history, geography, science, etc., as in 
mathematics, language, and literature, if the pupil is 
working on definite problems instead of merely mem- 
orizing materials. The old practice of “books closed” 
at the beginning of every recitation was based upon 
the idea that the lessons were learned—that is, mem- 
orized—and the chief thing left to do in the “Tecita- 
tion” period was for the teacher to hear the pupils 
“recite” or resay their lessons. Lesson-getting was a 
matter of memorizing materials. There are situations 
in which this idea is valid, and then it should be done 
thoroughly. On the other hand, the study of a prob- 
lem or series of problems may be carried on day after 
day before there is anything developed worth remem- 
bering. Therefore the teacher should adapt his tech- 
nique of using text-books to the accomplishment of 
specific educational developments in the pupil. 
4. Technique in using supplementary and reference 
materials.—The amount of supplementary or reference 
material employed in the teaching of the high school 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 257 
pupil should be relatively small in most of the fields of 
subject-matter. An intensive study of the materials 
presented in a good text-book will result in a more 
thorough mastery of the problems under consideration 
than will be secured through the reading of a consid- 
erable number of references. The chief difficulty in 
attempting to employ too many references is the actual 
physical burden of merely reading the printed material. 
The big problem is to induce careful thinking about the 
problem. The subject-matter materials assigned in a 
text-book or in any source of information should be a 
means of supplying mental fuel that will feed the 
intellectual and emotional fires. Too much mental 
fuel will clog the furnace of the mind just as surely as 
too much coal will clog the fire-box of the engine. The 
result is decreased combustion and great loss of energy. 
A little fuel thoroughly consumed is vastly better than 
tons of material that can not be consumed, but smoth- 
ers the fire into a slow smoldering of the thin edge of 
the mass. 
To whatever extent the teacher employs reference or 
supplementary materials, he should develop a definite 
technique of handling it. In the first place, reference 
material should be supplementary to the text, and 
therefore only the most reliable standard authorities 
and materials should be employed. In the second 
place, the teacher should save the time and energy of 
the pupil by giving very definite and specific directions 
that will guide the pupil in finding the materials.
-P-A-G-E-272
  258 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
These directions should include the following items. 
First, the pupil should be given the title of the book, 
author, title of the chapter, the topics, and the pages, 
when the reference is a book assignment. If the ref- 
erence is to a magazine, the title of the magazine, the 
year and month, the title of the article, the author, and 
the pages should be given. The pupil should also be 
given clear directions concerning the location of the 
reference materials in the library and the devices em- 
ployed by the librarian in aiding the pupil to find 
materials quickly. That is to say, the pupil should 
not be delayed, discouraged, and disgusted in attempt- 
ing to secure the reference materials. The more readily 
the pupil secures the materials and the more vitally 
these materials are connected with the real problem 
upon which the pupil is working, the more effective the 
ultimate results will be. Incidentally, too, the pupil 
will more and more get the habit of making use of such 
materials and will develop skill in using the library 
facilities. 
An important item in this connection is that the 
teacher should be sure that the reference materials are 
available and adequate for economical use by the group 
to whom they are assigned. Reference material should 
never be assigned as mere busy work or just to make 
the pupil “dig.” The only legitimate reason for assign- 
ing such materials is that they will be an effective help 
to the pupil in the study of a definite worth-while 
problem.

5. Technique in dealing with subject-matter—The 
first point or factor in determining the best technique 
to employ in the organization of subject-matter is that 
of the purpose for which the subject is being employed 
as a means of education. According to the purpose, 
the subject-matter in a course may be largely content 
material or it may be largely formal material. A sec- 
ond factor is the length of time—that is, the actual 
number of days—the school will be in session. The 
purpose and the length of time will determine the 
range or quantity of subject-matter that may be em- 
ployed. The teacher should lay out as definitely as 
possible the different stages of accomplishment of the 
purpose, and then arrange the subject-matter accord- 
ingly. This arrangement of materials can be done best 
by following a definite scheme of technique such as is 
herein suggested. 
First, determine the actual number of class periods 
that will be possible during the length of time that the 
subject-matter will be employed. The teacher should 
take into account the holidays and regular vacation, 
and then make an estimate of the possible or probable 
number of times that the class will not meet on account 
of other school activities and enterprises. It is best in 
this regard to allow for a few more interruptions than 
will ordinarily occur. The teacher will find no serious 
difficulty in using the few days’ leeway in case they 
are not taken up with general school affairs. 
Second, make an outline of the large codrdinate 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  260. TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
topics and the important sub-topics that seems to be 
absolutely essential to accomplish the purpose of the 
course. That is to say, determine the actual range of 
content material that it seems necessary to employ. 
Then decide upon the relative importance of the vari- 
ous codrdinate and subordinate topics, and divide the 
outline into two divisions, each of which is to receive 
half of the time given to the course. This does not 
mean that there will be or should be the same number 
of topics in each division. 
Third, make an outline of each of these two divisions, 
showing the number of days or weeks that will be 
allotted to each topic. Then outline the formal ma- 
terial that will be used on each particular day that will 
be spent in the development of the content topics. 
This will complete the scheme and will furnish a defi- 
nite basis for making readjustments in the face of the 
actual teaching situations that arise in dealing with 
different groups of pupils. 
6. Technique in daily teaching planning—The 
greatest value of daily teaching planning is that the 
teacher who faithfully practises it will acquire ability 
to estimate accurately what can actually be accom- 
plished; also, he will develop the habit of doing what 
he plans to do. These two items are highly important 
in determining the skill and efficiency of the teacher. 
In order to secure this value the teacher should estab- 
lish a definite form of technique or set of habits, and 
he should practise them faithfully. The following
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 261 
suggestions involve the fundamental principles that 
should be kept in mind. 
The first habit should be that of working out the 
complete details of the teaching, just as they will be 
used in the teaching period, two days before the teach- 
ing is to take place—that is to say, the day before the 
study assignment is given to the class. The point is 
not so much the number of days as it is the insuring 
that the details of the teaching as they will be used 
shall be carefully planned before the teacher makes the 
study assignment. The effect that the practice will 
have upon the efficiency of the making of the study 
assignment is obvious. Moreover, it is just as easy 
to be one day ahead as one day behind the making of 
the assignment in determining as to the details that 
will be employed. There will be times when this prac- 
tice must be modified, but in general it will prove to be 
most efficient. 
Second, the teacher should get the habit of setting 
up a definite obtainable goal to be achieved by means 
of each assignment. If this is not done he gets into 
the habit of filling in the time or of merely assigning 
tasks. Then the teacher can not tell the pupil who 
happens to be absent just what opportunities he missed 
and he can not tell the one who is present what he has 
gained by being present. As a result, the attending of 
a class is a matter of serving out a time sentence, and 
the studying of subject-matter is merely a problem of 
getting over so much ground. 
 
-P-A-G-E-276

262 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
Third, make an outline of the exact points or prob- 
lems that will be assigned to the class and the specific 
instructions that will be given to guide the study in 
preparation for the teaching period. Many times the 
pupil does not know just what he is to do or what is 
the best way to go about doing it. Frequently the 
teacher’s statements are confusing and lack coherence. 
The committing of instructions to written form will 
compel the teacher to study his instructions carefully 
and to reduce them to the simplest and most direct 
form. The teacher who follows this practice will 
greatly refine his pedagogical thinking, and in like 
measure he will develop his ability to express himself 
clearly. 
Fourth, the teacher should get the habit of esti- 
mating the amount of time that will be required in 
making the assignment and also of deciding when it 
should be made. The last point is largely dependent 
upon the maturity of the class and the nature of the 
problem that was assigned for the teaching period in 
which the new assignment will be made. Here again 
the importance of the suggestion that the details of 
the teaching be worked out at least a day before the 
assignment is given to the class is obvious. In fact, 
it really should be done two days ahead of the giving 
of the assignment, for that will enable the teacher to 
plan the time to be consumed by the giving of this 
particular assignment as a definite part of that day’s 
teaching time. For example, when the teacher on
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 263 
Monday assigns the problem for Tuesday, he should 
have in mind that a part of the time on Tuesday must 
be taken up with assigning the problem for Wednes- 
day. Now, he can not plan well for Tuesday unless 
he knows on Monday just what he will assign for 
Wednesday. Moreover, he must remember in plan- 
ning for Wednesday that part of the class period must 
be taken up with assigning the problem for Thursday. 
In other words, the teacher needs constantly to have a 
clear perspective of what is to be done two or three 
days later. 
Fifth, if the teaching plan is for a review, the teacher 
should mark out definite materials to be reviewed. He 
should work out a definite list of questions or an outline 
of points that will render the review thoroughly effec- 
tive. If the teaching is not to be entirely review, the 
plan should determine whether the reviewing that is 
done shall be given all at one time or distributed 
throughout the teaching period. This involves an 
accurate estimate of the actual number of minutes that 
will be required for the reviewing. The best practice, 
in this matter of concentrated or distributed review, 
must be determined by the nature of the subject-matter 
and the purpose of the teacher in making use of the 
review materials. 
Sixth, if the teaching plans for drill, the teacher 
should specify the particular points that are to be prac- 
tised. That is to say, he should know exactly what 
the pupil is to gain by means of the drill exercises. 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  264 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
Then, too, the plan should include the devices that will 
be employed in conducting the drill. If the teaching 
is not to be wholly drill, the plan should indicate the 
amount of time that will be devoted to drill. It 
should also determine whether the drill is to be carried 
on at one part of the teaching period or distributed 
throughout the period. This point must be deter- 
mined by the fundamental goal set up to be attained 
in the teaching period. 
Seventh, if the teaching is wholly or even in part a 
discussion of new subject-matter, the teacher should 
first of all set up a definite goal to be attained by 
means of the new subject-matter. If the pupil has had 
a previous assignment of the new subject-matter, the 
teaching plan should provide for a definite checking 
up on the preparation that he has made. The best 
way usually to do this is by having a definite series 
of questions or outline of points. The next step in the 
plan should provide for the development of points that 
the study by the pupil was not expected to give him. 
Here again, ordinarily the most economical practice is 
to employ a definite outline of points and to have spe- 
cific devices selected and fully prepared for use at the 
appropriate time. The development of these new 
phases of the subject-matter may involve the intro- 
duction of supplementary materials. When this is the 
case, the teaching plan should provide a definite out- 
line of the supplementary points, and it should also 
determine the exact means that will be most efficient
-P-A-G-E-279
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 265 
and available for presenting the materials. That is to 
say, the teacher should plan to supplement the develop- 
mental material by means of a lecture, mimeographed 
sheets of data, books, etc. A final point is that the 
technique of planning for the discussion of new subject- 
matter should include the habit of carefully estimating 
the time that will be required to deal with the problem 
in an adequate manner. 
7. The technique of employing the inductive prob- 
lem.—The high school teacher will use to a considerable 
extent the form of subject-matter organization known 
as induction; hence he should work out a definite set 
of habits and practise them thoroughly. These habits 
should be guided by the principles suggested below. 
These principles are in keeping with the psychology of 
learning set forth under method. 
The first principle is that the teacher should employ 
the most striking and representative cases in the first 
study of the characteristics that belong in the general- 
ization that is to be learned through actual contact 
with individual exhibitions of its existence. This 
really amounts to type cases, or, as ordinary expressed, 
“teaching by types.” The vital point is that the pupil 
should get a clear and vivid impression and under- 
standing of the essential characteristics at the outset. 
There should be no difficulty of understanding and no 
confusion in analyzing these typical cases. Next less 
striking or less representative cases should be studied, 
and then still less striking cases, until the pupil has 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
  266 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
met a number of cases of every degree of difficulty in 
analyzing out the essential characteristic of the gen- 
eralization. A careful gradation of cases will insure 
constructive progress in thoroughly mastering the 
generalization. 
A second principle is that the cases should always 
be made to appeal as vividly as possible to both the 
sensory and the ideational experiences of the pupils. 
This is largely a matter of good judgment in selecting 
devices and skill in employing them. 
A third principle is that the teacher should always 
employ an adequate number of cases of every degree 
of difficulty of analysis, and he should be sure to secure 
thorough practice upon the materials until the pupils 
are able to analyze miscellaneous lists of cases with 
facility and accuracy. The critical point is that the 
study of individual cases should not stop with mere 
understanding of the generalization, but that it should 
continue until an efficient mental habit and skill are 
secured. 
A final principle is that the teacher should require 
the pupil to develop and refine the statement of the 
generalization that is to become habit in his thinking. 
This may be thoroughly accomplished by comparing 
his statement of the generalization that he has worked 
out through the study of individual cases with the 
statement of the same generalization that may be 
found in books. The critical point is that the process 
of refining the pupil’s own statement of the generaliza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 267 
tion will refine his thinking and insure a better mental 
habit than can be secured by merely accepting and 
memorizing the statement of some author. The 
teacher should not be in too much of a hurry to have 
the pupil memorize something. Work for clear think- 
ing and the memorizing will largely take care of itself. 
8. Technique in employing the deductive problem. 
—The first point in the technique of employing the 
deductive form of subject-matter is that of beginning 
with the best possible statement of the generalization 
that is to be learned. The teacher should direct the 
pupil in working out a very thorough analysis of the 
statement of the generalization, so that the meaning 
of every word and phrase in the statement is clear and 
the understanding of the statement as a whole is com- 
plete. It is a good point in technique to employ some 
very striking representative individual case to aid the 
pupil in his analysis of the generalization. In other 
words, “type teaching” is valuable at this stage of 
mastering the significance of the generalization. 
The next point in technique, after securing a 
thorough analysis and understanding of the statement 
of the generalization, is to give the pupil ample oppor- 
tunity to apply the generalization to the identifying 
of individual cases. The first list of individual cases 
should be thoroughly typical, so that he will experience 
little or no difficulty in identifying them. The suc- 
ceeding lists of cases should be less and less typical, 
hence more and more difficult to identify, until every
-P-A-G-E-282
  268 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
type of case will have been presented that he will be 
likely ever to meet or be called upon to identify. 
The last point in good technique is that the teacher 
should employ an ample number of cases or applica- 
tions of the generalization and practise thoroughly 
upon them. Here again the vital point is that the 
study should not stop with understanding on the part 
of the pupil, but it should keep on until a definite 
habit of mind and a definite desirable mental skill 
have been developed. 
g. Technique in conducting the recitation —Good 
technique in conducting the recitation involves a num- 
ber of habits that should be thoroughly formed. The 
following suggestions are intended to give the impor- 
tant items that should be kept in mind. 
The teacher should form the habit of beginning and 
closing the recitation on time. Promptness is an 
important factor in efficiency and the prompt teacher 
will be a wholesome stimulus to his pupils. The 
inertia of a slow, dragging beginning of the work is 
difficult. to overcome, and the class will tend to be 
dropping back to the initial pace throughout the whole 
period. Dragging over at the end of the period induces 
lack of attention and loses time instead of gaining 
anything worth while. This dragging overtime also 
fosters poor planning on the part of the teacher and 
confirms him in his inefficiency. 
The teacher should form the habit of carrying out 
his detailed teaching plans. This implies that these
-P-A-G-E-283
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 269 
teaching plans are well made and thoroughly adapted 
to accomplishing the purpose of the teaching period. 
This does not mean that the teacher should never 
deviate from the prepared plan, but it does mean that 
he should have a very valid reason for modifying or 
abandoning his detailed plan. In other words, he 
should be able to show how the modification of pro- 
cedure secured the desired results more adequately than 
the prepared plan might have done. 
The teacher should form the habit of being sure that 
the pupil understands the new study assignment. This 
item has already been discussed under the technique 
of daily teaching planning, but it will bear further 
emphasis. The main point here is the skill with which 
the carefully planned assignment is given to the pupil. 
The teacher may put an outline of points and a state- 
ment of instructions upon the blackboard; he may put 
mimeographed copies of the materials into the hands 
of the pupil; he may dictate the outline and the in- 
structions; or he may use a combination of these 
various devices. Whatever he does, he should make 
it the most economical and effective way of getting the 
particular assignment into the possession of the pupil. 
The giving of the assignment should be prompt, clear, 
and concise. 
The teacher should use good English as a model for 
the class. He should modulate his voice to suit the 
situation, and he should enunciate clearly at all times. 
He should not indulge in diffuse, spontaneous state-  
-P-A-G-E-284
  270 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
ments that are not directed at the development of 
definite, worth-while results. In other words, he 
should not kill time through aimless speech. 
The teacher should correct the errors of the class in 
the use of English. The time and manner of the cor- 
rection should be determined by the type of error that 
is made. There are two types of errors that should 
receive attention. One type is the formal error that 
is usually due to carelessness, but that may be due to 
incorrect habit and lack of knowledge as to correct 
usage. The other type is the error of faulty sentence 
structure, awkward phrases, etc., due to insufficient 
training and to crude thinking in the subject-matter 
under discussion. 
The best time and manner for correcting the formal 
error is ordinarily to give immediately the correct form, 
which the pupil catches up and goes on with little or 
practically no interruption of his thinking and expres- 
sion. This practice is not always good, however, for 
some pupils are so timid and self-conscious that any 
interruption whatever throws them into such confusion 
that they lose the thought that they were attempting 
to express. The point is that the purpose of the cor- 
rection should not be to turn the attention of the pupil 
to the breakdown of his formal habit, but that the 
inefficient habit should be replaced more or less un- 
consciously and automatically by the correct habit. 
The correction of the second type of error is usually 
accomplished, in so far as it can be outside of a formal 
 
-P-A-G-E-285
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING Pay 
English training class, through refining the thinking of 
the pupil in dealing with the question in hand. If 
rather crude thinking is all that is required or expected, 
then crude English may be accepted without question. 
Tf clear, concise, well articulated thinking is desired and 
expected, then it is good technique to direct the think- 
ing of the pupil until he can give a good statement of 
the point under consideration. 
The teacher should practise the habit of having the 
pupil do as much of the talking as possible. The 
tendency to do more and more of the talking or dis- 
cussing of the problem will grow upon the teacher until, 
without realizing it, he is consuming most of the time. 
The teacher must keep constantly in mind the fact that 
it is what goes on in the mind of the pupil that educates 
him. Therefore the teacher must secure as many valid 
responses as possible from the pupil in order that he 
may study what is going on in the pupil’s mind. 
Moreover, the study habits of the pupil in preparing 
for the discussion of the preblem under consideration 
will be seriously affected if he is given little oppor- 
tunity to take an active part in developing the dis- 
cussion. 
A second point in this connection is that the teacher 
should bring each pupil into the recitation frequently 
in order to give all an equal opportunity and to stimu- 
late interest. Equal opportunity does not mean that 
each pupil should be called upon the same number of 
times. The point is rather that each pupil should be
-P-A-G-E-286
ee 
| 
272 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
given the amount of attention that will enable him to 
grow as much as is possible by means of the teaching 
situation. One pupil may need twice or three times 
as much stimulation and opportunity as another; 
hence it is giving each of these pupils an equal oppor- 
tunity if one is called upon twice or three times and 
the other only once. This point requires careful con- 
sideration. The teacher who neglects to plan a definite 
technique for each class group is very likely to let the 
strongest pupil, the very one who usually needs least 
attention and stimulation, usurp the time, while the 
weaker, timid, shrinking pupil drops into the back- 
ground and soon becomes averse to talking at all 
because of non-practice. Again, the pupil who is not 
active in the teaching period tends to become inatten- 
tive and not infrequently gives his interest to other 
things. Many problems in management and control 
arise because of faulty technique in keeping all the 
pupils in the group active participants in the carrying 
on of the discussion. 
A third point in this problem is that the pupil should 
be required to talk for the benefit of the whole class. 
Each pupil should feel under obligation to give the 
other members of the class the benefit of his contri- 
bution to the discussion. There is nothing so con- 
ducive to inattention as for the pupil to “recite” to 
the teacher. The rest of the class feel under no 
obligation to listen, to judge, and to question the 
performance of the individual member. The whole
-P-A-G-E-287
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 273 
performance soon resolves itself into the question, 
“Who will be the next victim?” The pupil who is not 
called upon is perfectly happy, for “The teacher did 
not get me this time” is the way he feels about the 
situation. On the other hand, when each pupil talks 
to the group and for the group, the group can be made 
to feel some responsibility for what is going on, and 
each member will be more likely to contribute at least 
some active thinking to the situation. 
Another point in the technique of calling upon pupils 
to recite is that the teacher should respect the indi- 
vidual differences of the pupils as to their facility of 
expression and the speed with which they can do the 
particular type of work in hand. The work of each 
pupil is also influenced by his particular temperament 
and traits of individuality. All of these factors should 
be recognized by the teacher and dealt with in such a 
way as to secure the best result possible for each indi- 
vidual and for the group as a whole. 
The teacher should face the class when stating a 
question or discussing a point. The teacher who talks 
to the blackboard, into a book, out of the window, up 
at the ceiling, etc., can not be studying the reactions 
of the pupils as they listen to the question or discus- 
sion. The teacher who studies the reactions of his 
pupils will acquire a fairly accurate technique of inter- 
preting their physical indications of attention, under- 
standing, and interest, and the indications of inatten- 
tion, non-comprehension, and lack of interest. This 
 
-P-A-G-E-288
  274 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
skill is one that renders the work of the teacher highly 
effective, for it enables him to adapt the language of 
his questions and the illustrative materials of his 
discussions to meet the situation. This habit or skill 
in technique can be acquired only through very 
painstaking conscious practice until the habit of alert 
visualization, observation, and interpretation becomes 
automatic. 
The teacher should form the habit of sticking to the 
lesson and not being sidetracked, especially by the 
keen-witted pupil who has not prepared the study 
assignment. Every worth-while problem has many 
connections with other problems, and it has many 
angles from which it might be considered. The ten- 
dency to abandon the definite line of development of 
the problem for interesting side excursions is very 
strong. The teacher should not preclude entirely the 
bringing in of side questions, but he should hold the 
discussion rather rigidly to the accomplishment of the 
definite end that was set up in the assignment. Im- 
portant, helpful, and worth-while correlations should 
be provided for in the plan of development. If this is 
done the wandering away from the valid issue can 
readily be reduced to the minimum and easily con- 
trolled. 
The teacher should have a definite plan for having 
individual pupils give special reports to the class. The 
purpose of such reports should be to bring a wider 
range of important materials to the class in a more
-P-A-G-E-289
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 275 
economical fashion than could be accomplished by 
having each member of the class read all of the 
materials. Therefore the pupil who gives a special 
report should employ the technique of lecturing. He 
should take the position of the teacher and he should 
give the class a definite outline of points and a dis- 
cussion of them, or he should give a definite body of 
facts well organized and in such form that the class 
can take down readily the essential data. Then the 
class should be held responsible for this material in 
whatever degree it is vitally connected with the de- 
velopment of definite mental habits. Special reports 
should not be handled as busy work. They should 
be made to contribute definitely to the development 
of the individuals listening to them. In other words, 
special reports should have a special educative func- 
tion. 
The technique that is involved in conducting re- 
views was indicated rather fully under the discussion 
of daily teaching planning. This plan provided for 
having a definite purpose, such as seeing the material 
from a different point of view or getting material fresh 
in mind as a means of developing new points or prob- 
lems in advance work, having a definite outline of 
material that is to be reviewed, and having a definite 
time for review. The point that should be uppermost 
in the carrying out of this plan is that of vigor and 
interest. The review should be conducted vigorously, 
so that the materials will be brought rapidly before 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
276 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the mind of the pupil. The review materials should 
not only be rounded up rapidly, but they should be 
connected in such a way as to be most interesting to 
the pupil. Then the review will always be an addi- 
tional step in the setting up of a definite habit of mind 
that renders the mental content most usable and 
permanent. While the review should be rapid and 
vigorous, it should not be hasty and lacking in em- 
phasis. The speed should be regulated so as to con- 
tribute to interest and effective emphasis of the most 
vital points. 
The technique involved in conducting drills was 
suggested in some detail under the discussion of the 
daily teaching plan. The points may be repeated at 
this place for emphasis and for more complete state- 
ment. First of all, the teacher should have a definite 
habit or skill as the purpose of the drill. Moreover, 
this habit or skill should be one that is worth while 
and important. Then, the teacher should have the 
subject-matter well in hand before the drill is started, 
and the devices should be ready for immediate use. 
A good point of technique in conducting drill is to 
keep the class grouped according to the range of indi- 
vidual differences in speed of working. The class 
should be kept in one group if possible, but more 
effective results may be secured by dividing the class 
into two or even three groups as the situation may 
demand. The tests referred to under the discussion 
on individual differences showed that most classes 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 277 
should be divided into not fewer than two and fre- 
quently into three groups, according to the speed with 
which they can accomplish work. Such division of the 
class will necessitate the most careful selection and 
arrangement of drill materials and a very carefully 
worked out plan for handling the groups simul- 
taneously. Exceptionally strong pupils may be made 
leaders of the drill groups and may increase the effi- 
ciency of the work very materially. 
If the whole teaching period is not to be taken up 
with drill, the teacher should have a definite time in the 
period for the drill, and he should have a definite 
amount of time for it. This does not mean that the 
drill should necessarily come all at one place. It may 
be distributed or given all at one place during the 
period, according to the actual amount of time that 
will be given to it and also according to the nature of 
the habit or skill that is being practised. 
to. Technique in laboratory work.—The efficiency 
of laboratory work may be greatly increased by form- 
ing definite habits of laboratory management. These 
habits should be adapted to the purposes for which the 
work is being done, and the routinizing of certain 
details will in general save time and energy for the 
vital educational activities. The items suggested be- 
low have proved effective when thoroughly established. 
The first problem in laboratory management is that of 
looking after the physical aspect of the work. This 
involves:
-P-A-G-E-292
278 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
A. Laboratory management, which should provide for: 
a. Apparatus— i 
1. Systematically shelved in locked casey or 
closets. 
2. Numbered in agreement with its shelf space. 
3. To be checked out and charged to individual 
pupils. 
4. To be returned by pupils to proper spaces 
at the end of periods and checked in. 
b. Materials— 
1. Systematically shelved in locked cases or 
closets. 
2. Marked conveniently in agreement with 
marking of the shelf spaces. 
8. To be checked out and charged to individual 
pupils. 
c. Wall charts showing by number or by alphabetical 
arrangement the shelving of apparatus and 
materials. 
d. Wall charts or cards showing the charges of appa- 
ratus and materials to individual pupils. 
e. Laboratory tables— 
1. Systematically designated by letters. 
2. Divided into definite working spaces and 
these spaces indicated by numbers. If 
tables contain drawers or locker spaces, 
they should be numbered in agreement 
with the numbers of the accompanying 
working spaces. If lockers are in regular 
cases, the working spaces at the tables 
and the locker spaces should bear the 
same numbers. 
*, Assignment of definite working spaces to indi- 
vidual pupils. A wall chart should be used to 
show the assignment of working spaces. Cards 
may also be used for the same purpose.
-P-A-G-E-293
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 279 
The second problem in laboratory technique is that 
of looking after the working conditions and the educa- 
tional materials. This aspect of the work involves: 
a. Assignment of experiments to individual pupils or to 
groups of two, three, etc., according to: 
1. The nature of the experiments. 
2. The adequacy of the laboratory equipment. 
3. Size of the class. 
b. Wall charts or cards that show the experiments as- 
signed, the groups to whom assigned, and the dates 
of assignment and completion of experiments. 
c. Note-book records of all experiments, which should 
be entered in the book during the laboratory period 
or made in duplicate by means of carbon sheets on 
note-paper and entered later. The duplicate copy 
of these notes should be dated by the teacher and 
filed for use in checking up the note-books. 
d. Definite time for checking out apparatus and mate- 
rials. 
e. Definite time for checking in apparatus, unused ma- 
terials, etc. 
f. Definite time for turning in notes. 
11. Technique in class-room management.—The 
general physical conditions have a decided influence 
upon the character and efficiency of the teaching situa- 
tion. Therefore the teacher should thoroughly rou- 
tinize the details of daily practice in looking after the 
class-room. A number of habits are involved as sug- 
gested below, and the order in which they are arranged 
is important. 
a. The teacher should form the habit of regularly 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
  280 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
inspecting the physical conditions of the class-room, if 
possible before the class comes in, and of regulating 
as far as possible the temperature of the room, the 
ventilation, and the light. These items should also be 
kept in mind and looked after at the proper time 
during the progress of the teaching period. The tem- 
perature should vary from about 66° to 70° F., and 
should never remain long at any one temperature 
within this range. The chief problem in ventilation 
is to secure circulation of air currents that will be mild 
enough to avoid giving the pupils colds, and yet strong 
enough to enable the bodies of the pupils to keep the 
proper balance between heat production and heat loss. 
In other words, ventilation should enable the vaso- 
motor systems of the pupils to function adequately. 
The light should be controlled as nearly as possible so 
as to secure a uniform distribution of illumination that 
is neither too feeble nor too strong. Since the source 
of light is not constant, this point will require careful 
watching and manipulation of the mechanical appli- 
ancesemployed in the class-room equipment. 
b. If the class-room is provided with chairs, the 
teacher should arrange these for suitable class grouping, 
and should note their condition as to dust, markings 
and cuttings, and mechanical defects of any sort. The 
prevention of confusion in seating and getting the 
attention of the class at the very outset is an important 
item, and having everything arranged before the class 
comes in is the best way to secure control. The preser-
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 281 
vation of school property, and particularly the preven- 
tion of the accumulation of markings and cuttings that 
are so subtle and yet so forceful in their suggestions, 
is also a very important point. The practice of daily 
inspection and the removal of defacements, whenever 
possible, without the pupils knowing anything about it, 
will go far toward accomplishing the desired results. 
c. Itis a good point in technique to note the general 
conditions, such as waste paper on the floor or desks, 
crayon on the floor, and books left carelessly lying 
around. If the teacher forms the habit of keeping 
these things cleaned up, it will be very helpful in 
securing the best attitude and spirit on the part of 
the pupils. An untidy room suggests lack of control 
and tends to produce an improper attitude toward the 
whole teaching situation. 
d. The teacher should look after maps and any other 
apparatus that may have been used during the previous 
period, and see that everything of this kind has been 
put into proper place and in proper condition before 
the next teaching period begins. This practice will aid 
in preserving the equipment and will also prevent 
confusion and distraction of attention during the teach- 
ing period. 
e. Itis also a good point in technique to see that the 
blackboards are free from distracting stimuli of any 
sort. Work left on the board by the preceding class 
may attract the attention of the pupils during the 
teaching period and thus greatly decrease the efficiency
-P-A-G-E-296
282 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
of the teacher. If the teacher wishes to keep work on 
the board for different teaching periods, it is a good 
plan to have a curtain or screen of some sort that can 
be readily adjusted to cut off the materials that are 
likely to attract undue attention. The technique of 
securing and holding the attention of a class is a skill 
greatly to be desired, and the teacher should study 
carefully to master every factor that enters into it. 
f. Another item in connection with the problem of 
attention is that of the teacher’s desk. The condition 
of the teacher’s desk should always be such that it will 
never prove a distraction to the pupils. Devices and 
apparatus that are not to be used in connection with 
the present teaching period should be kept out of sight 
of the pupils. The top of the teacher’s desk is not a 
good place to store such materials because it makes 
them too conspicuous. Moreover, the condition of the 
teacher’s desk will be reflected to greater or lesser 
degree in the attitude and habits of the teacher; hence 
it tends to increase or decrease the efficiency of the 
teacher. 
g. A final item is that of noting the general physical 
condition of the pupils. This should be done very 
quickly as the pupils come in and are being seated. 
The particular items to note are dress and indications 
of physical condition. Pupils should be appropriately 
and adequately dressed according to the time of the 
year. Any attempt to create a disturbance or to at- 
tract undue attention by means of freakish or striking
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 283 
modes of dress should be checked at its inception, and 
it is only by the practice of daily noting items of dress 
that the teacher will safeguard against possible dis- 
turbances. Then, from the standpoint of physical 
condition, the teacher should be alert to observe the 
pupils who have colds, seem feverish, or exhibit any 
indication of possible contagious disease. The teacher 
needs to know the general condition of each pupil’s 
health in order to modify the demands made upon 
different individuals during the teaching period. The 
physical condition of pupils from day to day is a 
constantly changing factor of individual differences, 
and it can be met adequately only by the development 
of a high degree of skill in observing significant indica- 
tions of individual health. 
12. Technique in the general management of the 
class.—The technique of general management of the 
class should provide for a number of definite plans. 
The most important items that should require definite 
planning are suggested below. 
a. The seating of the class should be worked out 
according to the size of the class; physical conditions 
of the room, such as light, heat, etc.; individual needs, 
such as defective hearing, defective sight, etc.; amount 
of moving from seats to blackboard or other changing 
of positions; character of the teaching period, such as 
a congress in history or English, debate, etc. 
As a rule the class should be as closely grouped as 
possible and in some uniform order. Pupils should be
-P-A-G-E-298
    284 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
seated so as to free them from physical discomfort due 
to too strong a light, too much sun, or too high a 
temperature from radiators and hot-air intakes. Pupils 
who have defective hearing should be placed near the 
center of the room, rather than in the very front row. 
The point is to place them so they will have the best 
opportunity to hear the discussions of every pupil as 
well as the discussions of the teacher. The pupils with 
defective vision should as a rule be placed near the 
front. However, far-sighted pupils will see most ad- 
vantageously near the rear of the room, and they will 
not be so apt to suffer from eyestrain. If all of the 
seats in the room are not to be occupied and much 
blackboard work is to be done, the seats farthest from 
the blackboard should be left vacant and the pupils 
placed as advantageously as possible in the seats 
nearest the board. When the class is organized into a 
congress or a debate section, it should be grouped 
accordingly. If the seats are movable, they should be 
arranged so as to separate the different groups involved 
in the organization. 
b. The teacher must keep account of attendance; 
hence he should work out the best technique to practise 
that will insure the carrying out of the performance in 
the most economical way that insures accuracy. If the 
class is small, the teacher may be able to tell at a glance 
which pupils are missing. The record, as arule, should 
be made at the beginning of the teaching period. The
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 285 
regular seating of pupils will enable the teacher to 
note absences readily by means of a seating chart. 
This device will aid the teacher greatly in becoming 
acquainted with individuals in new groups of pupils. 
Another economical plan is that of assigning a number 
to each member of the class and then having the record 
checked by each pupil calling his own number in proper 
sequence, beginning with one. The teacher will call 
the numbers for which no one responds and note the 
absentees. Still another plan is for each member of 
the class to call his name in a predetermined alpha- 
betical order, the teacher calling the names of those 
who do not respond in proper place. Then there is 
the very common practice of the teacher calling the 
names of the class. Whatever plan is adopted, it 
should be administered with promptness and accuracy. 
c. The teacher should have the pupils put all dis- 
tracting stimuli out of the way at the very beginning 
of the teaching period. Such objects as books, pencils, 
papers, pens, etc., that will not be used in the progress 
of the teaching performance should be placed where 
the pupils will not be handling them. The problem 
of attention is involved and this point of technique 
will aid materially in solving it. The handling of such 
objects, even more or less unconsciously, will distract 
the attention of the pupils who do the handling, and 
it will also to some degree attract the attention of 
other pupils. Every such distraction of attention en-
-P-A-G-E-300
RMR ee Reena Tres e SOREN ee RT men MR pee PPR TD Gs Meee RMN Seep fa! 8 p> ek RA Re ae a 
286 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
feebles the impression made upon the minds of the 
pupils by the subject-matter and decreases the effi- 
ciency of the learning process. 
d. The plan of collecting and passing papers, books, 
and other materials should be thoroughly routinized. 
The important point is economy of time and avoidance 
of confusion. For example, in collecting quiz papers 
have all papers passed across by rows from right to 
left, or vice versa, and then forward. The first paper 
should be on the bottom and each succeeding paper 
placed on top. Likewise, the papers from the rear row 
should be on the bottom and the papers of each suc- 
ceeding row placed on top. The teacher should keep 
them in this order, and the order can be reversed in 
returning the papers. The use of papers of uniform 
size, folded in a uniform manner, will save time and 
energy for the teacher in reading and grading them. 
e. If there is much passing to and from the black- 
board, a definite plan will save time and confusion. 
The assigning of a particular blackboard space to each 
pupil will prove helpful. If pupils are left to their 
own devices, they not infrequently seek the board space 
farthest from where they sit, and sometimes disputes 
arise over conflicting claims as to who shall use a 
certain board space. The size of the class and the 
available board space should be taken into account. 
f. The practice in calling upon pupils to take part 
in the discussion may be modified according to the class 
and the nature of the work. If pupils are permitted 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 287 
to volunteer, a definite form of procedure will be 
helpful. The pupils might indicate their desire or 
willingness to contribute answers or discussions by 
standing in place by their seats and waiting for recog- 
nition by the teacher, or they may raise their hands. 
The teacher should be very alert and prompt in recog- 
nizing the pupils’ expressions of willingness or desire 
to take part. If the teacher does not want the pupils 
to volunteer, he should have a definite plan for calling 
upon pupils that will not allow aggressive pupils to 
monopolize the situation. The use of name class cards 
may be used by the teacher with satisfactory results. 
This point in technique is correlated with the item 
given under the discussion of technique in conducting 
the teaching period, namely, that each pupil should be 
given an equal opportunity to participate in the dis- 
cussions. The practice followed in calling upon pupils 
will have much, if not almost everything, to do with 
insuring that this idea be actually carried out. 
g. The position of the pupil in talking is important; 
hence the teacher should follow definite practices, ac- 
cording to the size of the class and the nature of the 
work. If the class is fairly large, the pupil should 
stand while talking, in order that he may be seen and 
heard. Even coming to the front of the class and 
facing the group while talking may be excellent prac- 
tice both for the individual pupil and for the group. 
The effectiveness of this custom may entirely offset the 
loss of time that may seem to be due to it. In small
-P-A-G-E-302
  288 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
groups the pupil may recite just as effectively while 
seated as he could possibly do while standing. If 
standing helps a pupil to think and speak more clearly 
than he does when sitting, he should be permitted to 
stand even when the group is small. On the other 
hand, there may be cases when the pupil is so embar- 
rassed by standing before the group that he should be 
permitted to contribute his discussion without rising 
to his feet. Effectiveness of results upon individuals 
and upon groups is the barometer that should be 
watched. 
h, A final item in the technique of the general 
management of the class is that of the practice in 
designating the pupil who is to recite. The pupil may 
be called by his or her first name or he or she may be 
called Mr. or Miss ——. The teacher should deter- 
mine which practice is most effective for him to use 
in general, according to his own individuality and the 
naturalness with which he employs the technique 
selected. The practice may be varied with different 
groups, and also with the same group on different 
occasions. The use of Mr. and Miss when done in a 
natural manner has a wholesome sociological as well 
as psychological effect upon the pupil of adolescent 
age. The instinct for individual recognition is strong 
at this period, and the feeling of personal dignity and 
personal responsibility is deepened by the courteous 
use of the conventions of society. The teacher must 
be able, however, to employ these conventions so
-P-A-G-E-303
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 289 
naturally that he makes them express a feeling of 
respect and consideration for the one addressed, so that 
the pupil will be moved to feel and express respect in 
his responses. The use of first names may be made 
effective, too. The main factor is the personality of 
the teacher. The forceful, earnest, sincere teacher will 
impress the pupil with either form of technique, and 
he can employ either with equal naturalness and 
facility. 
13. Technique and the personality of the teacher.— 
The technique of the teacher is greatly affected by his 
personality. Therefore the teacher should study those 
elements that have most to do with giving him stand- 
ing and power in the eyes of the pupils. The following 
items suggest the most obvious and the most effective 
of these elements. 
a. The teacher’s voice is an element of personality 
that seriously affects his technique. That is to say, it 
affects the quality of his performance. The quality of 
the teacher’s voice, and particularly its pitch and 
modulation, has much to do with the effect it will have 
upon the pupils. A shrill, high-pitched voice will be 
irritating and disagreeable to listen to for any length of 
time. Such a voice, even when well modulated, is 
too irritating to secure good results. 
An effective voice must not only possess a pleasing 
timbre or quality and be well pitched and modulated, 
but it must have the power to express sternness and 
even anger, enthusiasm and earnest sincerity, per-
-P-A-G-E-304
  290 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
suasion and satisfaction, and humor. That is to say, 
the inmost soul and heart qualities must somehow 
reach out through the voice in such a way that the 
pupils really sense the vital force of the teacher's 
character through audition. The voice is to a great 
degree the barometer of the soul. It expresses the 
tension, the tranquil assurance, and the indifference 
of heart that its possessor experiences. It betrays sham 
and pretense, affectation and insincerity most accu- 
rately. The individual who wishes to conceal his real 
attitude of mind and heart had best keep his mouth 
shut, for not so much the words that he utters as the 
quality of his vocalization will betray his inmost 
feelings. 
b. The visual alertness and extent of the visual field 
of the teacher has an effect upon his technique. The 
teacher should strive to acquire the largest possible 
visual scope and to train his eyes in alert watchfulness 
and power of steady gaze that is not staring and that 
does not give the impression of spying. The eyes 
equally with the voice portray the quality and depth of 
the individual’s feeling and attitude toward others. 
The quality of a glance may express approval or dis- 
approval, sympathy and friendliness, or criticism and 
hostility. The eyes are indeed the windows of the 
soul and character; therefore the teacher’s technique 
will be qualified by the power that he acquires of 
establishing vital visual contacts with his teaching 
situation through his visual facilities.
-P-A-G-E-305
  
THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 291 
c. The facial expression of the teacher is an element 
of personality that affects the general quality of his 
performance. The teacher should acquire the power 
of masking all emotions under a non-committal expres- 
sion, and also the power of expressing freely and 
naturally all the emotions that he genuinely feels. The 
affected smile should give way to a natural expression 
of real pleasure and satisfaction. The habitual stern 
and forbidding cast of countenance should likewise be 
avoided. Cultivate a sincere, optimistic habit of mind, 
and fashion the facial expression to portray it accu- 
rately and truthfully. 
d. The general bearing, address, and attitude of the 
teacher is an element of personality that qualifies 
everything that he does. The teacher may fairly hyp- 
notize his pupils with the assurance, vigor, and power 
of his general bearing. He may exhibit decisiveness, 
firmness, and no dallying, and yet be friendly, im- 
personal, and somehow command the respect of his 
pupils. The naturalness of general bodily attitudes 
and physical habits of posture have much to do with 
giving effectiveness to this element of personality. 
e. A final element of personality is that of dress. 
Clothes do not make the man, but they do suggest the 
character and qualities of the man. The teacher 
should dress in good taste and in styles that are appro- 
priate to the school work and to the seasons of the 
year. Sport styles, loud colors, low-necked waists, 
high, narrow-heeled shoes, etc., should not be worn in
-P-A-G-E-306
  292 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the school-room. Dress should be harmonious with 
the character of the individual, and should not attract 
undue attention to itself or appeal to any particular 
instinct or impulse in others. Dress should express 
neatness, geniality, and natural refinement of indi- 
viduality. 
14. Technique in supervised study, in measuring 
the results of teaching, and in discipline—The ele- 
ments of good technique in supervising the study of 
pupils, in measuring the results of teaching, and in 
developing proper behavior of adolescents are so intri- 
cately tied up with the other principles involved in 
the aspects of teaching that the discussion of these 
phases of technique will be given in connection with 
the discussions in these three fields. 
SUMMARY 
The technique of teaching includes not only the acts 
performed by the teacher, but also the skill with which 
these acts are performed. The pedagogical sequence 
of any teaching problem is the psychological processes 
of the learner, the devices employed in presenting 
subject-matter, and the technique or acts performed by 
the teacher. Technique should be selected in keeping 
with definite criteria. These criteria should involve a 
consideration of the effect upon the learner’s perform- 
ance in learning, naturalness with which the teacher 
can employ the technique selected, nature of the de- 
vices employed, maturity of the pupil or class, nature
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE TECHNIQUE OF TEACHING 293 
of the subject-matter, length of teaching period, and 
the environment of the class-room. No act of tech- 
nique should be an end, and each act should be judged 
good or bad according to the effect produced in each 
situation. 
Special attention should be given to the technique of 
employing the devices of questioning, lecturing, use of 
text-books, and use of reference materials. Careful 
attention should also be given to the technique of 
organizing the course in a subject and to presentation 
of subject-matter in the form of inductive and deduc- 
tive problems. The teacher should develop a thorough- 
going technique of conducting the teaching period, 
whether it be a so-called regular teaching or laboratory 
period. He should also master an effective body of 
technique for management of the class-room and man- 
agement of the class. The personality of the teacher 
always greatly affects his technique.

CHAPTER X 
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS OF 
HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
What is supervised study ?—The point of view taken 
in this discussion \is that the definite guidance of the 
learning efforts put forth by the pupil is supervised 
study. This is the vital function that all teaching is 
to serve; hence every teaching period and every assign- 
ment given to the pupil should guide his study so as 
to bring about results that he could not secure as 
readily without the help of the teacher. This point 
needs emphasis, for there should be no distinction 
between the teaching period and the so-called super- 
vised study period. It is not necessary to have a 
double period or an extended period in order to have 
supervised study. It is highly essential, however, to 
know just how long the teaching period should be for 
the adolescent pupil in order to secure the maximum 
of results in the employment of the various fields of 
subject-matter. The question is, how long can and 
should the mind of the adolescent pupil be directed 
intensely, in the study of any type of problem or 
subject-matter, without relaxation and change to some- 
thing different? The answer to this question can be 
295
-P-A-G-E-310
  
  l 
296 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
arrived at only through very careful scientific experi- 
mentation carried on under thoroughly controlled 
conditions. 
The starting-point—The starting-point in super- 
vised study--that is, good teaching—is the pupil. The 
teacher needs to know at the outset what type of mind 
the pupil possesses, what the status of his mind is in 
respect to the different kinds of mental maturity that 
are to be furthered through study, what the mental 
content of his mind is in regard to facts, concepts, ete., 
what his habits of reading and interpretation are, and 
what are his habits of memorization of important 
material. In other words, the starting-point of all 
good teaching—that is, supervision of the pupil’s study 
—is what the pupil is now in respect to maturity and 
habits. 
This fundamental proposition, again, emphasizes the 
point that a careful diagnosis and measurement of each 
pupil is absolutely essential at the outset in order to 
establish a base from which to proceed consistently and 
constructively. The teacher might very well take a 
week or even two weeks to accomplish this at the 
beginning of the year or semester, as the case may be, 
before starting the pupil into the study of the par- 
ticular field of problems or subject-matter. If this is 
not done the teacher can not give to the pupil intel- 
ligent directions that will be pointed to his specific 
needs. He has no real basis for selecting devices and 
determining the technique that will be of greatest
-P-A-G-E-311
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 297 
advantage to the pupil. The teacher must necessarily 
proceed upon the basis of more or less intelligent 
guesses and haphazard spontaneous experimentation 
of the try-and-fit sort. Therefore he starts out with 
a lesson assignment, and he is soon engrossed with 
“hearing lessons.” Thereafter his chief concern is that 
the pupil shall “come up with his lesson.” How the 
pupil makes out or manages to get the lesson is vir- 
tually unthought of, unless perchance it is a situation 
in which the pupil might borrow from some good fellow 
student and present false credentials. Then, indeed, 
the teacher is lynx-eyed to catch such subterfuges, and 
how smug and righteous he feels when he “spots” the 
“cribbed” material. Good teaching or good super- 
vision of the study efforts, based upon definite starting- 
points for growth and development, is the only way 
to break down and get away from these old traditional 
weaknesses of teaching. 4 
Starting the study activities of pupils.—The first 
step in starting the study activities of the pupil is to 
set up as clearly as possible in his thinking the ultimate 
results that are to come to him as a result of his efforts. 
Then the pupil should be made to understand as fully 
as possible why dealing with the particular body of 
subject-matter will help him to attain the goals set up. 
Finally, the pupil should be given as clear a conception 
as possible of the general procedure that will probably 
net him the largest gain in dealing with the subject- 
matter of the course. After showing the pupil where  
-P-A-G-E-312
298 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
he is headed for, what road he is to travel, and what 
the facilities for travel are, the teacher is ready to start 
the pupil on his first detailed study assignment. 
Two fundamental goals of supervised study.—All 
good teaching—that is, supervised study—has two 
great objectives. The first of these objectives is such 
mastery of subject-matter during the teaching period, 
under the personal direction of the teacher, that defi- 
nite results in the education or mental maturity of the 
learner are secured. The second objective is the de- 
velopment of independence on the part of the pupil, so 
that finally he can adequately direct his own study 
activities in working on any problem whatsoever. The 
first of these objectives has been the one most empha- 
sized in the supervised study practices. This emphasis 
has led to the double period, the lengthened period, and 
the divided period schedules. 
The investigations that have been made of the super- 
vised study practices show that the emphasis on per- 
sonal direction of the study activities of pupils has 
helped the weaker pupils, but has not been of so much 
help to the stronger ones. Likewise, it has proved 
helpful in some subjects and not helpful in others. 
The chief danger, perhaps, in the general practice is 
that it tends to over-emphasize the one objective and 
to neglect the second most vital objective. The second 
objective is more important than the first, for the most 
valuable thing that the pupil can learn is learning how 
to learn and forming good habits of learning. There-
-P-A-G-E-313
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 299 
fore the personal direction of supervised study should 
gradually give way to the more and more impersonal 
direction, until the pupil is virtually independent of 
the guidance of the teacher. 
The teaching period.—The fundamental aim of the 
teaching period should be the study of worth-while 
problems and the drilling upon important habits to 
render them perfect. The teacher should as far as 
possible abandon the old recitation practice of having 
the pupils resay what they have learned. The results 
of the pupil’s study should furnish needed mental 
materials for going on with the study of problems that 
could not be attacked by the pupil to any advantage 
until he had acquired these materials. If the teaching 
period is to be given over to drill, the study prepara- 
tion should be drill on the smaller habits that will be 
involved in the larger habit upon which the drilling 
will be done under the immediate direction of the 
teacher. These smaller habits should be so automatic 
that the pupil can not very well go wrong in practising 
them upon his own responsibility. 
If teachers will make the teaching period a place 
for guiding the pupil into a further study of problems 
upon which he has worked in his own individual study, 
or a study of new problems the solution of which has 
been made possible by the study preparation of the 
pupil, the chief weakness of the traditional recitation 
will disappear and genuine supervision will be the 
order of procedure. Then the length of the period can
-P-A-G-E-314
  300 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
be determined by the ability of the pupil to carry on 
intensive study to advantage. Experimentation will 
show whether longer or shorter periods of intensive 
effort net the greatest development on the part of the 
pupil. 
The chief difficulty experienced by teachers in at- 
tempting to supervise the study activities of the pupil 
has been that they have not had definite, clear-cut 
goals set up. A second difficulty has been a lack of 
thorough understanding of the psychological procedure 
of the learner in mastering any kind of subject-matter 
presented tohim. The lengthening of the class period 
and the giving of a double period may not help much, 
for if the teacher is not prepared to guide the study 
of the pupil definitely and effectively through an ordi- 
nary class period, he will not do anything more definite 
or effective in a double period. That is to say, if the 
teacher does not and can not effectively supervise the 
study of the pupil by means of the regular recitation 
period, he will not be able to supervise his study effec- 
tively through a longer period that is divided into a 
so-called recitation period and a supervised study 
period. This is a fundamental truth, and failure to 
recognize it has led to enormous waste of time, energy, 
and money in the provisions made for supervised study 
in many schools. One of the common complaints 
made by superintendents and principals about the 
inaugurating of supervised study in their schools is 
that the teachers have not been trained to supervise 
 
-P-A-G-E-315
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 301 
the study habits of the pupils, hence they do not utilize 
the time to the best advantage. 
What this complaint means.—The validity of this 
complain rests upon the very far-reaching fact that 
teachers are not trained to teach. They do not know 
how the pupil learns. They have been too largely 
trained to “teach subjects” and not trained to guide 
the psychological processes of the general mental 
movement as the pupil learns any and all fields of 
subject-matter. The teachers who could really teach 
did not need supervised study periods to secure satis- 
factory results. Likewise, to-day, as teachers do learn 
how to direct the study activities of the pupil definitely 
and effectively, they do not need double periods, but 
can go back to the old class period and accomplish the 
desired results, or they can even shorten the old reci- 
tation period and still secure better results than they 
did with the longer periods. A truly scientific teacher 
can do more genuine, thoroughgoing supervision of the 
study habits of the pupil in ordinary or even shortened 
teaching periods than the lesson-hearing teacher can 
accomplish in the so-called recitation and supervised 
study periods. Therefore what is needed is not some 
new type of training that will enable the teacher to 
supervise the study habits of the pupil in addition to 
teaching him during the recitation, but rather it is that 
the teacher shall be really trained to teach the adoles- 
cent boy and girl; for if he really teaches the pupil, he 
must do it by directing his mental activities and habits 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
  302 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
in the study of definite materials that lead to definite 
goals. The problem of teaching and of supervision of 
study is one and the same; hence solving the one 
_-simultaneously solves the other. 
The study assignment.—The study assignment or 
the so-called lesson assignment is one of the chief 
means that the teacher can employ in supervising the 
study habits of the pupil. The fundamental elements 
of a study assignment are, first the setting up of a 
definite goal that the pupil can attain in a reasonable 
time with a reasonable amount of industry and effort; 
second, clear directions as to the best and the most 
economical and effective means of attaining the goal; 
third, definite criteria for determining when the goal 
has been reached. If the pupil is given a study as- 
signment of this character, he will soon get the habit 
of studying on his own responsibility, and also the 
habit of doing what is laid out for him to do. The 
habit of studying alone, with no other guide than the 
definite directions given by the teacher, will ultimately 
lead the pupil to independence not only in studying 
with merely the aid of written suggestions and direc- 
tions, but also independence in setting up his own 
goals and in directing his own study efforts. 
The critical point in reference to the study assign- 
ment as a phase of supervised study is that the pupil’s 
preparation, or rather the results of the pupil’s study, 
shall be capitalized during the teaching period in doing 
something under the personal guidance of the teacher
-P-A-G-E-317
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 303 
that he can not do effectively by his own individual 
efforts, even with the written directions and sugges- 
tions. If the teacher fails to capitalize the results of 
the study assignment during the regular teaching 
period, the pupil will soon stop carrying such assign- 
ments out in any sort of effective and thoroughgoing 
manner. On the other hand, when the pupil realizes 
that the study assignments prepare him for learning 
during the teaching period, he will see what he loses 
by not carrying out the assignments faithfully. When 
he realizes the loss incurred in not studying, he will 
get the habit, not of getting lessons, but of studying 
and learning. This will be the case most assuredly 
if the goals are reasonably attainable, if the directions 
are very clear and concise, and if there is a definite 
means of knowing when the goals have been reached. 
The traditional amount of time that the high school 
pupil is supposed to spend in “getting his lesson” is 
one hour. The testimony of school-teachers is that 
the average amount of time actually spent is from 
fifteen to thirty minutes. One of the chief reasons 
for this difference between tradition and practice is 
that much of the time the pupil does not know exactly 
what he is driving toward, he does not know how to 
drive effectively toward the supposed goal, and he of 
course has no idea as to when he has arrived. This 
being the case, it is not to be wondered at that the 
pupil spends fifteen minutes in meandering around 
over the lesson and feels at the end of that time that 
   
-P-A-G-E-318
  804 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
he has the lesson. This feeling is no doubt based upon 
the fact that he does not know what more to do; hence 
he is under the impression that he has arrived. 
Technique of supervised study.—The technique of 
supervised study should be selected in keeping with the 
fundamental movement of the mind in learning, and 
also in accordance with the specific mental processes 
that go on within the fundamental movement of the 
mind as it deals with different types and phases of 
subject-matter. The essential principles of technique 
that should guide the practices of the teacher in assign- 
ing problems that are to be studied by the pupil on his 
own responsibility, and in assigning problems that are 
to be studied under the immediate personal direction 
of the teacher, are identical. Therefore these prin- 
ciples should be carefully thought out and made habit 
in the thinking and doing of the teacher. 
Raise specific problems.—The first step in the 
supervision of the study activities of either a class 
group of pupils or of an individual is to raise some 
specific problem or problems and set up very clearly 
and definitely in the mind the exact goals that are to 
be attained through study. This step corresponds to 
the first step in method of learning—namely, seeing 
the thing as a whole. The study assignment should 
enable the pupil to see each problem as a more or less 
vague whole and to set up as a purpose the mastery of 
the problem through thorough analysis and reunifica- 
tion, so that it will be seen as a clearly understood or
-P-A-G-E-319
  
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 805 
known whole. The pupil now knows what is to be 
learned and the first step in learning it has already 
been taken. This first step having been taken posi- 
tively and definitely, the road toward the goal of 
learning in any particular case is opened up, and the 
pupil is ready to travel it by means of a series of 
directions given in a study assignment by the teacher 
that will guide him when studying alone, or by means 
of suggestions given by the teacher in person at ap- 
propriate intervals as they pursue the study of the 
problem. 
The critical point in this first step of enabling the 
learner to see a definite problem as a whole is that 
of knowing just what specific mental processes—that 
is, sense-perception, memory, imagination, judgment, 
and reasoning—must be employed intensively in order 
to get the problem clearly enough defined in the think- 
ing of the pupil, so that he will be able to proceed 
in his study by means of well adapted directions. 
A certain degree of analysis is always involved in seeing 
anything as a whole, and the teacher must make the 
study assignment in such a way that the learner sees 
the whole and analyzes it far enough to realize the 
problem and the possibility of solving it. Therefore 
the teacher must be sure that the whole is not too 
vague and indefinite on the one hand, and not too well 
defined or analyzed on the other; for if it is analyzed 
out too far in the assignment, the learner. has little to 
develop by his own study. The teacher, then, must

| 
306 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
determine accurately whether memory or imagination 
or sense-perception or judgment-forming or reasoning 
will be the mental process most involved in setting up 
the study whole, or whether some combination of these 
processes will be clearly involved. This point must be 
determined very largely by the nature of the problem 
and the maturity of the pupil, for these two items will 
determine the degree of analysis that must be made 
in order to set up the problem as a whole and to define 
the goal toward which the study of the problem is to 
take the learner. 
The second step in supervising the study activities 
of the pupil is that-of suggesting relevant subject- 
matter that will aid in the solution of the problem or 
problems set up in the study assignment. First of all, 
this step should make clear the kinds of subject-matter 
that are relevant and helpful. Second, the source from 
which the relevant subject-matter can readily be se- 
cured should be clearly understood. The pupil will 
now have a definite problem or whole set up as a goal, 
and he will have the subject-matter materials with 
which to solve the problem at hand. He is now in a 
position to attack the solution of the problem definitely 
and systematically. 
The vital point in this second step is that the essen- 
tial subject-matter materials shall be accessible and 
readily secured by the pupil, and that the pupil shall 
be made to realize the connection between the subject- 
matter materials and the goals of study. This latter  
-P-A-G-E-321
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 307 
point is highly important, for its realization will secure 
an intelligent study of subject-matter as related to the 
attainment of a goal that lies beyond the materials 
themselves, instead of a more or less blind studying and 
memorizing of subject-matter as a lesson. 
The third step in the supervision of study is to 
suggest and direct the mental activities of the pupil 
in the sifting and selecting of relevant facts. This step 
involves the psychology of the method of learning, and 
everything that the teacher does should be pointed 
especially to directing the pupil in carrying on the 
processes of analysis and synthesis. The study ac- 
tivities of the pupil should enable him to discover the 
essential facts involved in the solution of the problem 
set up and to organize these facts into a coherent unity 
or solution. These processes of analysis and synthesis 
will involve certain specific mental processes, according 
to the nature of the problem. These processes may 
demand a good deal of temporary memorizing of 
materials in order to work out thoroughly all the essen- 
tial details and to reunify them around the core or 
central idea that is the real significance of the problem. 
Imagination may be employed intensively or it may 
be little employed. Judgment-forming and reasoning 
may be very highly needed in analyzing out the essen- 
tial facts and relationships and in reorganizing them 
around the dominant idea or significance of the whole. 
The function of the teacher in directing the processes 
of analysis and synthesis in the study activities is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
    308 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
give suggestions and directions that will aid the pupil 
in making the necessary judgments, carry on the 
reasoning, construct clear images, and economically 
memorize, temporarily or permanently as the case may 
demand, the facts and relationships that go to make 
up an effective solution of the problem. The degree 
to which the teacher can do this successfully by means 
of a study assignment will depend upon the nature of 
the problem and the maturity of the pupil. If the 
problem involves a good deal of temporary memorizing — 
in order to make valid judgments in either the analysis 
or the synthesis, the pupil may very well carry on the 
necessary study activities during a study period in 
which he works independently of the teacher, except 
that he follows the directions given by the teacher in 
making the assignment. Then, when the pupil comes 
into the teaching period, the teacher may direct in 
person the further study activities of the pupil, so that 
he makes the judgments, constructs the images, and 
carries on the reasoning that results in the development 
of a definite solution of the problem set up for study. 
If, however, very little memorizing is involved, but the 
chief mental processes involved in carrying on the 
study are judgment, reasoning, and imagination, the 
teacher may need to direct personally most of the first 
attempts of the pupil in working out the analysis and 
synthesis of the unity or problem under consideration, 
‘The individual differences of pupils are vitally in- 
volved in the third step in supervision of study activi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 309 
ties. Therefore the teacher needs to know the particu- 
lar type of mind possessed by each pupil and each one’s 
particular weaknesses. The teacher may need to have 
a number of personal conferences with the pupils in 
order to discover these particular weaknesses. This 
may be accomplished through personal direction of all 
the study activities of all the pupils during the teach- 
ing periods. As the teacher becomes acquainted with 
the types of minds and particular weaknesses of pupils, 
such as poor memory, feeble imagination, limited con- 
cept of thinking, narrow judgment span, etc., he may 
begin to give study assignments that the pupils can 
carry out effectively on their own responsibility. This 
shift from all direction of study activities through 
personal oversight to partial direction, through series 
of suggestions given at the time of making the study 
assignment, will enable the teacher to accomplish more 
in the development of definite units of maturity by 
dealing with more subject-matter well organized and 
adapted to the particular pupils being taught. The 
study of the pupils on their own responsibility may be 
so guided and directed that results of their efforts will 
enable the teacher to carry them further into the study 
of the problem during the teaching period. When 
this stage of development in the technique of super- 
vising the study activities is reached, genuine vital 
supervision of study is going on in all of the teacher’s 
| work with the pupils. 
The fourth step in directing the study of the pupil
-P-A-G-E-324
  310 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
is that of suggesting the means of testing and verifying 
results. .The pupil needs to know when he has reached 
the desired goals set up in the study assignment. The 
kinds of tests and checks that may be employed by the 
pupil in determining whether or not he has accom- 
plished the ends set up in the study assignment will 
vary according to the nature of the problem and the 
subject-matter involved in its solution. The tests and 
checks in mathematics, for example, are different from 
the tests and checks that may be employed in lan- 
guage or in science. The tests and checks in mathe- 
matics, however, are no more definite and tangible than 
are the tests and checks in other fields of problems. 
Every type of problem has some kind of valid check as 
to the correctness of the solution of the problem. 
The critical point in this step is that the teacher 
shall so direct the study activities of the pupil that he 
will necessarily make the testing and verifying of the 
results a part of the learning performance. In fact, the 
testing and checking is an integral part of the study of 
any problem. Therefore the mastery of any sort of 
problem whatsoever is not complete until the learner 
can demonstrate the validity of his solution by means 
of a vital test or check. The forming of the habit of 
thoroughly testing and checking the results of the 
study activities is one of the most important goals of 
supervised study, and in fact of all education. The 
pupil who does not form this habit is content with 
merely putting forth effort in study, or more accu-
-P-A-G-E-325
  
SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 311 
rately, perhaps, he is satisfied with putting in time in 
going over his lessons. Such a pupil can not be very 
ambitious or enthusiastic over his work, for he does not 
know what he really is accomplishing by his study 
efforts. 
The teacher also needs to form this habit of testing 
and verifying the results of the study activities of the 
pupil. The teacher who does not give the pupil valid 
means of testing and checking the results of his study 
activities will be content with giving him tasks to per- 
form instead of giving him worth-while goals of growth 
and development to attain through definite study 
activities. In other words, such a teacher will give 
lesson assignments that will keep the pupil busy in- 
stead of study assignments that will secure a definite 
result in the way of habit formation or acquisition of 
valuable facts. It is a lamentable fact that a large 
number of lesson assignments in high school are noth- 
ing more nor less than busy work for the pupil. Busy- 
work lesson-assigning teachers usually exhibit a great 
development of industry in carrying on their work, but 
they never make their pupils enthusiastic students. 
The time element.—One of the traditional bugbears 
of the study habits of the pupil is the time he is sup- 
posed to put upon the preparation of a lesson. “The 
traditional time is one hour a lesson. The supposition 
is that it will take the pupil an hour to prepare enough 
subject-matter material to last him through the tradi- 
tional recitation period; hence if he does not spend an
-P-A-G-E-326
  312 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
hour in preparation, he will run out of anything to 
resay to the teacher when the teacher conducts the 
reciting performance. Then, too, the teacher must 
have enough subject-matter materials prepared by the 
pupil to avoid the embarrassment of running out of 
ammunition before the sham battle is over. 
The result of this tradition of requiring the high 
school pupil to spend an hour in the preparation of 
each lesson is that the teacher falls into the habit of 
measuring out subject-matter doses in terms of time 
sentences that the pupil is to serve as a penalty for 
taking the course. Hence he devises every means pos- 
sible for clamping on the ball and chain, and then 
watches eagle-eyed for those daring souls who may slip 
the shackles at the end of a half-hour or even after 
fifteen minutes of supposed study. The teacher who 
falls into the habit of imposing time-serving tasks upon 
the pupil and in hearing him resay his lessons fre- 
quently develops the attitude of mind that makes him 
resentful against the pupil who slips his bonds. That 
is to say, he regards the pupil who fails to serve his 
time sentence faithfully as an offender against the 
teacher’s dignity and authority. This frame of mind 
sometimes develops to the point where the teacher 
does not want the pupil who has broken bounds to 
appear in the resaying performance. This attitude on 
the part of the teacher creates an anomalous situation 
in the case of an offending pupil. If the pupil stays 
out of class he is considered as “cutting,” and the
-P-A-G-E-327
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 313 
teacher of the foregoing type always resents the ab- 
sence of a pupil when he thinks it is a voluntary 
absence or “cut.” But if the pupil has not served his 
time sentence in preparing his lesson the teacher does 
not want him in class; hence he forces a “cut” upon the 
pupil. 
The remedy for such an inconsistent point of view is 
that of setting up definite worth-while attainable goals 
of growth and development that the pupil can recog- 
nize as being valid, and then making study assignments 
for the pupil to carry on alone that will enable him to 
continue his study of the problem during the teaching 
period. This will encourage the pupil to be present 
during the teaching period in order to make the most 
of the teacher’s personal directions and skill in direct- 
ing the study activities. Moreover, this practice will 
encourage the pupil to do the things suggested by the 
teacher in giving the study assignment. This will be 
true especially if the teacher gives the pupil valid tests 
and checks that will enable him to know when he has 
accomplished the desired result, instead of merely put- 
ting in time and getting over the lesson. 
The important point is that the pupil should form 
the habit of doing a definite thing to the best of his 
ability. The pupil who spends fifteen minutes work- 
ing definitely to accomplish a perfectly tangible result 
and succeeds in doing the job well in that time is vastly 
better off than the one who spends an hour getting a 
lesson to recite, or in going over the subject-matter
-P-A-G-E-328
314 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
materials that have no particular connection with any- 
thing vital in his thinking. The habit of definite 
achievement is educative and the actual amount of 
time spent in such achievements should be a variable. 
Set up the definite goal, and be sure that it is humanly 
possible of attainment within a reasonable length of 
time for every pupil in the group to which the study 
assignment is given. In other words, let the time 
element be a secondary matter, except that the maxi- 
mum must be within reason. 
What would happen?—The teacher who has the 
attitude and point of view set forth above should 
visualize the ultimate results of such a system of penal 
servitude. Suppose every pupil could be compelled to 
put in one hour in the study preparation of each lesson 
assigned to him. And suppose, further, that he put in 
each such study hour working with intensive concen- 
tration. Then suppose still further that the pupil 
gives most concentrated attention and effort during 
the “recitation.” What would the result be? This 
program of procedure would mean at least eight hours 
of the most intensive mental effort and concentration 
out of every twenty-four hours for five days in the 
week. According to scientific studies that have been 
made, this amount of time spent in intensive or even 
in a moderately concentrated mental effort would be 
the equivalent of sixteen hours of manual labor. That 
is to say, eight hours’ mental work would consume as 
much energy and drain the vital resources of the body 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 815 
to the same degree that sixteen hours of manual labor 
would do. This being true, the ultimate result is 
obvious. One can see clearly that sixteen hours a day 
of manual labor for an adolescent boy or girl would be 
killing. Such work, however, would not be as killing 
or as dangerous to the present and future well-being 
of the adolescent as would eight hours of intensive 
mental effort. 
This scientific fact, coupled with the psychological 
fact that the adolescent pupil is in a state of unstable 
equilibrium, makes the conclusion perfectly clear that 
if adolescent boys and girls in general tried to follow 
out faithfully and religiously such an exacting program 
of study and recitation, which is founded wholly upon 
the traditions of “teaching the subject,” the hospitals, 
the insane asylums, and the cemeteries of this country 
would be wholly inadequate to meet the demands that 
would be made upon them. Such a régime is against 
the fundamental proposition that secondary education 
should help adolescent boys and girls to live in the now 
in such a manner as to develop adult beings with sound 
bodies, mature, reliable minds, and desirable social atti- 
tudes. The rational thing to do is to kill the tradition 
instead of killing the adolescent pupils. 
Supervision of study and initiative of the pupil.— 
The objection has been made against supervision of 
study, or rather against too much supervision of study, 
that it tends to destroy the initiative of the pupil. 
The thought seems to be that the supervision of study  
-P-A-G-E-330
316 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
may result in making the pupil more dependent and 
weaker in ability to attack problems alone and to solve 
them through his own efforts. This idea grows out of a 
failure to analyze the psychology of initiative. The 
term initiative literally means to go into. The usual 
definition of the word, however, is going into a thing 
alone and without the help or suggestion of any other 
individual. That is to say, the individual who starts 
something, who acts first in a situation, who is first to 
think of what to do or how to do it, is supposed to have 
initiative. Therefore the argument is that the teacher 
may give so many suggestions and directions that the 
pupil has little opportunity to think for himself. The 
result is that the pupil forms the habit of waiting for 
some one to start him in his work. 
The real situation psychologically is that the pupil 
must form certain habits that will automatically func- 
tion whenever he faces a problem situation before he 
can go into things alone and without aid or suggestions 
from another individual. He can not exhibit the so- 
called initiative without having first developed the 
basis for meeting spontaneous situations. The super- 
vision of study rightly directed will develop initiative 
instead of hampering it; for real supervision of study 
will develop the very habits that one must possess in 
order to attack problems on his own responsibility. 
The setting up of definite goals or problems, the sifting 
and selecting of relevant facts, and the testing of 
results are the fundamental habits involved in initia- 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 317 
tive. The work of the teacher is to direct the study 
efforts of the pupil in such a way that these habits 
become permanent in the procedure of the pupil in all 
study. As these habits grow and become efficient, the 
teacher naturally modifies and reduces his directions 
and suggestions to the minimum in making study 
assignments, and he also modifies his suggestions to the 
minimum in personally directing the study activities of 
the pupils. 
The pupil always has opportunity to exercise initia- 
tive in interpreting and applying the directions and 
suggestions of the teacher. He can not gain anything 
from the services of the teacher unless he goes into the 
study assignment thoroughly. Therefore the pupil 
always has directed initiative in following out the 
study directions and suggestions. If he exercises this 
directed initiative, he soon acquires such habits of 
attack and solution of definite problems that he will 
not be Jacking in spontaneous initiative when thrown 
upon his own resources. Directed initiative has devel- 
oped the resources necessary for spontaneous initiative. 
Supervising the study of the absent pupil—The 
setting up of definite goals of habit formation and of 
mental acquisitions in the way of facts, definitions, 
concepts, etc., and the devising of definite tests for 
measuring accurately these units of mental maturity, 
simplifies the problem of what to do about the work of 
the absent pupil. The pupil himself can be made to 
see what he really misses or what he fails to develop by 
 
-P-A-G-E-332
318 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
being absent. The problem for the pupil is that of 
securing the desired development in habits and mental 
equipment. The problem of the teacher is that of 
directing the study of the pupil so that he will be able 
to make the desired growth and be able to measure up 
to a satisfactory test of such growth. The pupil does 
not in any true sense make up work, but he really 
makes personal growth of the desired sort. 
The critical point in this problem is that the pupil 
should not be given make-up subject-matter assign- 
ments that are nothing more nor less than mere tasks 
set in order to fulfil the letter of the law. The dealing 
with subject-matter should insure growth of a specific 
type. If the pupil already possesses such growth, he 
has no need to make up anything. If he does not 
possess such growth and he is not given a study assign- 
ment that will help him to attain it, he has not been 
benefited by the so-called make-up work. 
This problem of supervising the study activities of 
the absent pupil goes back to the fundamental propo- 
sition of giving each individual an equal opportunity 
to be educated. The pupil who has less growth to 
make than others does not need to deal with as much 
subject-matter and he does not need to be under the 
personal direction of the teacher as much as do other 
pupils who have not the same maturity of definite 
mental habits and equipment. Whenever the goals of 
education are made definite enough for the pupil to 
recognize them, he will realize that teaching periods 
   
-P-A-G-E-333
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 319 
and personal help of the teacher are opportunities and 
not merely requirements that must be met to make a 
passing grade. Moreover, he will appreciate and wel- 
come these facilities that will enable him to attain the 
definite units of mental maturity. 
Types of subject-matter and supervised study.— 
The balance between study assignments that the pupil 
is to carry out alone and the study that can be most 
effectively carried on under the immediate personal 
direction of the teacher may be largely determined 
through a proper utilization of content material and 
formal or practice material. The taking up of new 
phases of content subject-matter can usually be done 
most effectively under the personal direction and 
guidance of the teacher. When the content material 
has been sufficiently mastered to enable the pupil to 
employ formal material in order to complete the learn- 
ing and render it habit, study assignments can be made 
that will enable him to deal with the formal material 
in an effective manner. Some of the practising and 
drilling upon habit formation should be done under 
the personal direction of the teacher in order to avoid 
serious errors and waste of time. For the most part, 
however, the real drilling can be carried on safely by 
the pupil. This is especially true where the teacher 
provides the pupil with definite tests and checks to 
enable him to determine the results of his efforts and 
the status of his own development in regard to any 
articular unit of mental maturity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
    320 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
The critical point is that the teacher should not 
take time for personally directing the study activities 
of the pupil if these study activities can be carried on 
just as well by the pupil working alone. The teacher’s 
time during the teaching period, that is, the personally 
directed study period, should be devoted to helping the 
pupil to do things that he can not do efficiently by 
himself. Therefore the teacher should not be an in- 
spector who sees that the pupil has obeyed instructions, 
nor an overseer who stands over the pupil merely to 
see that he works at the job. The teacher should be a 
help and an opportunity that the pupil learns to capi- 
talize in working out his own educational salvation. 
This function of being a helper will bear most fruit if 
the teacher manages his teaching periods largely in 
developing valid content material and utilizes his study 
assignments chiefly for rendering permanent and auto- 
matic habits already well started. 
SUMMARY 
Supervised study is definite guidance of the learning 
efforts put forth by the pupil. The starting-point is 
the pupil; hence the teacher needs to know the pupil’s 
type of mind, his unit of concept in thinking, his 
mental content of facts and concepts, and his habits of 
memorization. The first step in directing the study] 
activities of the pupil is to set up definite goals to be 
attained through study. These goals should be at- 
tained through study under the personal direction o!
-P-A-G-E-335
  SUPERVISION OF THE STUDY HABITS 321 
the teacher and through independent study. One of 
the chief objectives of supervised study is to make the 
pupil independent of the teacher. The teaching period 
should be utilized for the study of worth-while prob- 
lems. 
Teachers do not need a new type of training, but 
they do need to know how to teach the pupil so he will 
learn effectively; then their teaching will become the 
best sort of supervised study. The study assignment is 
one of the chief means of guiding the study habits of 
pupils. The technique of supervised study involves 
the raising of specific problems, suggesting relevant 
subject-matter, suggesting means of sifting out and 
selecting relevant facts, and suggesting the means of 
testing and verifying the results. 
The tradition of requiring an hour in study prepara- 
tion of a lesson should give way to the habit of attain- 
ing a definite, tangible result within a reasonable time. 
Fifteen minutes spent in attaining a definite goal is 
better than an hour spent in fulfilling the letter of the 
law without attaining a specific end. Adolescent pupils 
could not stand the mental strain long if they actually 
spent an hour in intensive study on every lesson 
assignment and an additional hour of intensive atten- 
tion and mental effort for every period of teaching. 
Supervision of the study activities develops the 
power of independent study or initiative. The super- 
vision of the study activities of the pupil who has been 
absent should be directed to securing definite growth
-P-A-G-E-336
  322 
  TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
and development and not to “making up” work. The 
amount of personal direction of the study activities of 
the pupil is largely determined by the kind of subject- 
matter being employed. Content material requires 
more personal direction than does formal or practice 
material.

  CHAPTER XI 
THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 
Stages of conduct development.—The history of 
the human family discloses two distinct stages of char- 
acter or conduct development—the external criteria 
stage, and the internal criteria stage. These two stages 
of character development are marked by two distinct 
philosophies of life. The history of the race in the 
development of behavior is repeated in the history of 
each individual of the human family. Every human 
being who lives to adulthood exhibits the two stages 
of conduct in obedience to external criteria, and con- 
duct in obedience to internal criteria. Likewise, each 
individual is dominated by the same two philosophies 
of life that parallel these two stages of conduct devel- 
opment. Therefore any rational attempt to develop 
conduct or character must be based upon these his- 
torical and psychological truths. 
Stage of external criteria——When the human race 
was passing through the stage of external criteria it 
had to have laws and positive commands telling it what 
it should not do. This was the time of the ten com- 
mandments written on tables of stone. It was the 
324
-P-A-G-E-339
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 325 
period when the people bowed to a “Thus saith the 
Lord.” The human race had to learn obedience to law 
and authority, and human conduct and character were 
measured in terms of implicit obedience to the external 
mandates. 
The philosophy of this stage of external criteria is 
based upon the idea of “an eye for an eye, and a tooth 
for a tooth.” Any offense or disobedience must be 
punished by some external means similar to or related 
to the offense and of a comparable degree of severity. 
Therefore the offender must be “beaten with stripes,” 
his body must be bruised, or some dreaded physical 
suffering must be meted out to him. Members of the 
human family must be obedient to the external criteria 
of behavior or they must pay the external penalties. 
The fundamental psychology of this stage of behav- 
ior is that of fear. Obedience was a matter of fearing 
the penalty. The command “Thou shalt not” carried 
with it the menace of the penalty that must be suffered 
by the offender. The essence of moral education was 
to put the “fear of God” into the hearts of mankind. 
The individuals who feared the Lord most and obeyed 
his commandments most faithfully stood highest in 
moral behavior. 
The important point in this stage of fear and obe- 
dience to external laws and command was that the 
responsibility for directing and controlling human be- 
havior was outside the individuals themselves. The 
one who made the laws and issued the commands was 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  326 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
the one to see that the members of the human family 
feared and obeyed. The ruler was to set up all laws 
and to put them into full effect. He was the one to 
execute the laws and to administer the penalties for 
disobedience. On the other hand, the individuals of 
the race were to obey. They were not held responsible 
for the rightness of the law, but were responsible only 
for those acts that were covered by some law or 
command. 
The stage of internal criteria—The human race 
through obedience to external law finally reached a 
stage of moral development that enabled it to see the 
reasons why the law was right. The race now realized 
the values that were embodied in the laws and com- 
mands. That is to say, the criteria began to be within 
the hearts and minds of human beings. The@xternal 
law was merely an expression of the internal concep- 
tions of values and right relationships between man 
and man and between man and God. Thus it was 
through fear and obedience that the human family 
reached the status of adult moral responsibility. This 
idea is expressed in the saying “The law was the 
schoolmaster to bring you to Christ.” 
The philosophy of this stage ofGnternal criteria is 
based upon the idea that each individual shall work out 
his own salvation with fear and trembling, but not fear 
of some penalty that will be inflicted by an irate ruler, 
rather a fear of failure to realize and to know the right 
and to do it because it is right) Therefore the one who
-P-A-G-E-341
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 327 
misses his way is to be dealt with mercifully and 
pointed to the right way. Justice is to be tempered 
with mercy and love, in order that the erring one may 
find the road to right living that is based upon knowl- 
edge of values and faith in the eternal love, mercy, and 
goodness of the Creator. 
- The fundamental psychology of this stage of internal 
criteria is that of love. The one who loves the Lord 
does his will, and he does it because he recognizes the 
great altruistic relationships that are covered by the 
will of God. The law is now enshrined within the 
hearts of men, and they obey the law through love of 
what obeying it brings to mankind and to themselves. 
The only fear that is felt at this stage is the fear of 
failing to render service, and not the fear of some pen- 
alty for disobedience. The obedience that is rendered 
is obedience to love in the heart and to the desire to do 
good, and not the obedience to external law or 
mandate. 
The important point in this stage of internal criteria 
is that the individual assumes responsibility for his 
decisions and for his behavior. He no longer looks to 
mere laws as telling him what to do and what not to 
do, but he evaluates the various factors in the situation 
and makes independent decisions that enable him to 
make appropriate adjustments to cases that are not 
exactly covered by the external law set up. 
The development of the individual—Each indi- 
vidual exhibits these stages of criteria in his develop-
-P-A-G-E-342
    328 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
ment from childhood to maturity. The period of child- 
hood is a period of obedience to external law and 
specific commands as to what shall be done and what 
shall not be done. The child learns through fear and 
disagreeable experiences to obey the will of those who 
are older and more powerful. He is not able to set up 
in his own thinking the reasons why one act is consid- 
ered wrong. He does understand, however, the injunc- 
tion, “Thou shalt not”; hence he looks to external 
laws to tell him what to do and what not to do. 
The child is not held responsible for creating stand- 
ards of behavior, but he is held responsible for obeying 
standards set up by law. Adult society assumes the 
responsibility for setting up the standards of behavior 
for the child and also the responsibility of compelling 
the child to obey the standards. Therefore the child is 
made to feel to some degree that getting caught is the 
main crime. And the child likewise is made to feel that 
acts not specifically covered by statement of external 
law are legitimate performances and that no penalty 
should follow the doing of such acts. The chief prob- 
lem of the child, then, is to keep within the law. That 
is to say, it is concerned with knowing what the “thou 
shalt nots” are. 
The adult—that is, the mentally adult individual— 
exhibits the stage of the internal criteria of behavior. 
He weighs the various facts and factors in the situation 
and decides what is right and what is wrong. He obeys 
law, too, but he obeys because of his appreciation and
-P-A-G-E-343
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 329 
understanding of the standard set up by the law rather 
than through a feeling that he must obey because it is 
the law. He feels responsible for helping to create the 
standard and also for helping to make it effective by 
obedience to it. That is to say, he feels the responsi- 
bility of directing his own behavior in keeping with 
recognized standards. It is this attitude of personal 
responsibility for both the creating of standards of 
behavior and living up to them that makes life and 
property safe in any community. This feeling of indi- 
vidual responsibility is society’s protective insurance 
against danger and depredations. The police and other 
officers of the law are the agencies for dealing with the 
emergencies that arise. They are protective to a cer- 
tain degree, but they would be absolutely helpless with- 
eut the preventive agencies of right attitude and per- 
sonal responsibility assumed by the majority of people. 
Adolescence the critical stage.—The individual does 
not change abruptly from childhood to adulthood. He 
passes through a period during which he is part child 
and part adult in his understanding and point of view 
concerning the setting up of law and the obeying of 
established standards. The adolescent period that links 
childhood with adulthood is a period during which the 
criteria of behavior are partly external and partly in- 
ternal most of the time. The adolescent is groping 
toward adulthood and is struggling mightily to be born 
again, or rather to be born into full maturity of physi- 
cal, mental, and moral powers. This struggle is marked
-P-A-G-E-344
  330 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
by many exhibitions of childish behavior and also by 
many manifestations of adult behavior. This fact 
greatly complicates the problem; for he can not be 
treated wholly as a child, nor can he be treated wholly 
as an adult. He must be dealt with in such a way as to 
enable him to realize the weakness of his childish be- 
havior and to win the right to be accorded full adult 
consideration. 
The problem.—The critical problem, then, in the 
development of the adolescent pupil toward maturity 
of conduct is that of making him realize the social 
problems and the social significance of these problems 
as they arise in the school activities. The pupil must 
be made to realize that the problems of conduct are his 
own individual problems, and that he who would re- 
ceive recognition as a mature citizen and be his own 
boss must demonstrate his ability to evaluate the facts 
and factors in his social situations, and not only to set 
up appropriate standards for his own behavior but 
also to hold himself responsible to live up to these 
standards. The problem, then, is one of constructive 
education. Therefore the adolescent pupil needs more 
and more opportunity for determining what he should 
do and less and less of the “thou shalt not.” The point 
must be kept clearly in mind at all times that the goal 
to be attained in the development of the conduct of the 
adolescent boy and girl is that of rendering them citi- 
zens who are not concerned about keeping within the 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 331 
law, but who are vitally concerned about keeping the 
law within. 
Constructive education the road to character.— 
The point of view herein maintained is that the de- 
velopment of conduct or character is a matter of edu- 
cation. The adolescent boy and girl must set up 
definite social problems in regard to the adjustments 
necessary to promulgate satisfactory relations with 
other individuals and with groups of individuals. The 
solution of these social problems will bring social 
mental maturity and reliable habits of behavior. 
Therefore a definite plan for setting up social problems 
of more and more complex character should be pro- 
vided in the secondary school. 
The critical point is that the pupil should not be 
expected to master the fundamental principles that 
underlie the establishment of satisfactory social rela- 
tions without facing similar problems a number of 
times and thoroughly analyzing these problems. The 
same laws of learning are involved in studying a prob- 
lem in human relationships that are involved in study- 
ing problems in mathematics or problems in science or 
problems in any other field. The teacher of mathe- 
matics does not expect that one explanation of a theo- 
rem in geometry will give the pupil thorough mastery 
over the principles that are involved in its solution. 
Much less even does he expect that one analysis of the 
theorem will give the pupil mastery over the applica-
-P-A-G-E-346
  332 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
tion of the theorem to the solution of practical prob- 
lems. Moreover, the teacher of any field of academic 
problems does not expect one hundred per cent. mas- 
tery of the particular field of problems on the part of 
any pupil, and he expects a considerable range of de- 
grees of mastery on the part of a class group, and 
some pupils are expected to fail even though they try 
faithfully to learn by means of the particular field of 
problems. 
This point of view should be taken in regard to the 
mastery of social problems of actual school life. The 
teacher should not expect any pupil to attain one hun- 
dred per cent. mastery over the problems of conduct; 
nor should he expect any less range of degree of mas- 
tery of these problems of behavior from a class than he 
expects from the same class in the mastery of any 
particular field of subject-matter problems. Moreover, 
he should expect that some pupils will fail to master 
many of these conduct problems, even though they try 
ever so faithfully to master them and to gain thorough 
control over their behavior. 
The crux of the whole matter is that the develop- 
ment of conduct involves practice in applying the prin- 
ciples of social relationships just as truly as drill and 
practice are involved in making growth by means of 
mathematical problems or by means of any other kind 
of subject-matter problems. Errors must be expected 
and many wrong judgments made in attacking the 
solution of these problems of living agreeably with 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 333 
other people. The pupil must acquire many social 
experiences and must organize these experiences into 
valid unities based upon significant social ideas and 
ideals. This can not be done by means of a few social 
contacts and a few critical situations. Only through a 
great wealth of social contacts and a large number of 
critical situations can the individual sift out and set up 
permanent ideas and ideals that will forever constitute 
reliable internal criteria to guide his behavior. 
Setting up social problems.—The most important 
point in the issue of setting up social problems is that 
the pupil himself should recognize and fully realize the 
nature of the problems and the necessity of their solu- 
tion. This point involves certain factors that must not 
be forgotten in dealing with social situations in the 
secondary school. One of these factors is that of actual 
conditions. 
The essential consideration in connection with the 
factor of conditions is that conditions must become 
very unsatisfactory in many instances before the pupil 
recognizes the seriousness of the problem to the degree 
that he will feel that something ought to be done about 
it. This is the way, exactly, that society as a whole 
is awakened to action in regard to setting up proper 
ideas and ideals to guide the behavior of its members. 
National prohibition, for example, was not possible 
until the conditions resulting from the use of liquor 
became so bad that they could no longer be tolerated. 
Some day the cigarette evil will create conditions that
-P-A-G-E-348
  334 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
will be so unsatisfactory that the nation will act in 
ridding itself of the nuisance. Likewise, then, groups 
of pupils in the secondary school must face conditions 
that are so unsatisfactory that they will be roused to 
action in solving the situation. They then will set up 
appropriate standards of behavior to guide in eradi- 
cating the evils and in setting up proper social rela- 
tions. In other words, pupils must experience unsatis- 
factory conditions in their social contacts before they 
can build up a mental and emotional background of 
idealism that will lead to appropriate reactions and 
positive action in bringing about desirable changes. 
This factor is a vital one, for it is the essential foun- 
dation of moral education that makes the difference 
between a “Thus saith the Lord” and “Work out your 
own salvation.” It is the ground of opportunity upon 
which the pupil becomes responsible for “laying down 
the law” instead of having the law laid down to him. 
Conditions that are disagreeable and unsatisfactory 
constitute the furnace in which the irons of life adjust- 
ments are brought to white heat, so that they may be 
welded into strong standards conforming to worthy 
ideals. The pupil must feel that he himself, for the 
most part, creates and is himself responsible for the 
conditions pertaining in the school activities. Then his 
experiences in actual contact with these conditions may 
awaken such a feeling of dissatisfaction, when condi- 
tions are not conducive to constructive education, that
-P-A-G-E-349
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 335 
he will assume the responsibility of bringing about 
necessary changes. 
Types of constructive education in behavior.—The 
whole problem of developing democratic citizenship 
involves two types of constructive education. The 
first type is that of systematic study of social problems 
pertaining to the carrying on of the school activities. 
The pupil should have regular instruction that will 
keep him busy with the job of finding out what condi- 
tions are desirable and how to secure these conditions. 
The pupil commits many thoughtless acts and makes 
many mistakes and blunders in conduct, simply be- 
cause he has not studied the science and art of living 
agreeably and helpfully with his fellows. The greatest 
defense against such thoughtless and even ignorant 
errors in behavior is to make the problems of school 
life a part of the curriculum in order that the pupil 
may receive the benefit of living his social problems 
through in connection with thinking them through. 
That is to say, he must live out his thinking and also 
think out his living. 
The other type of constructive education is that of 
making each individual case of unsatisfactory behavior 
a means of bringing the individual face to face with the 
vital social issues involved and require him to assume 
responsibility for correctly solving the problem. The 
systematic study of social problems should give the 
pupil the theoretical background of principles that
-P-A-G-E-350
  336 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
underlie the setting up of appropriate interrelations 
between individuals and between groups of individuals. 
The actual living out of social relations brings to each 
individual the spontaneous practical problems of mak- 
ing appropriate social adjustments. Each such indi- 
vidual problem or case of misbehavior gives the pupil 
practice in applying the social principles to an actual 
concrete case. Drill or practice in working out a 
correct and satisfactory answer to his problems of 
behavior is just as essential as drill and practice in 
mathematics. The pupil is not expected to acquire 
thorough mastery over the scientific principles of 
mathematics, or to acquire skill in applying these prin- 
ciples to the solution of practical problems without a 
great amount of drill and practice. Therefore the 
pupil should not be expected to master the social 
science of setting up appropriate relations with others 
or to acquire skill in putting these social principles into 
effective operation in his own conduct without ample 
opportunity to study and to solve the problems that 
arise in his actual behavior. 
The great function of the teacher, then, in directing 
the behavior of the adolescent boy and girl is not to 
issue edicts of “thou shalt not” and “thou shalt,” but 
to raise questions and to suggest data that may help 
the pupil to see the real problem and to bring his 
knowledge of social principles to bear upon the solution 
of the problem. The vital issue here, as in every case 
whatsoever in which the pupil is in error, is not that
-P-A-G-E-351
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 337 
the pupil made the error, but it is the question of why 
he made the error. The teacher should aid the pupil in 
analyzing his behavior in order to help him to discover 
what he needs to build up in his content of knowledge, 
what he needs in the way of habit formation, that will 
insure against a repetition of the error. That is to say, 
the teacher should make a psychological analysis of 
the pupil’s conduct in each particular case when an 
error has been made, just as she should do in mathe- 
matics or in any other subject that is being employed 
in the education of the individual. 
The chief difficulty is that the teacher is too prone to 
szenter attention upon the performance of the pupil. 
This tendency is noted in connection with dealing with 
all types of subject-matter. The teacher too frequently 
fails to realize that the overt act of the pupil, whether 
it be an error in solving a social problem or an error in 
language, is only a symptom or an index to what is 
going on within the mind of the pupil. Therefore the 
teacher invariably treats the symptom instead of get- 
ting at the defects that lie beyond the symptom. Be- 
cause the teacher has this point of view he usually 
undertakes to correct the symptom, when he should be 
looking to the giving of a course of constructive treat- 
ment that would remove the malady itself. Treat the 
internal conditions and the symptom naturally dis- 
appears. The teacher does the same thing in respect 
to language errors or mathematical errors, etc. He 
corrects the overt act or the symptom, and too fre-  
-P-A-G-E-352
  338 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
quently leaves the mental malady for which the symp- 
tom was only an index, a clue, entirely untouched. 
The psychology of punishment.—The old order dis- 
regarded the psychological factors that determine the 
real punishment of the individual who is struggling to 
keep the law within instead of keeping within the law. 
The idea of an eye for an eye as a fitting penalty for 
having committed a fault overlooked the psychological 
truth that genuine mental suffering comes through 
realization of the significance of what one has done and 
not through bruising of the flesh or through mental 
lashings of sarcasm, indignation, accusation, social dis- 
grace, etc. A few examples will make this point clear. 
A bridge-tender swung the bridge at the wrong 
moment and caused a passenger train to be precipi- 
tated into the river. Virtually no one escaped from 
the wreck alive. The man was arrested, tried, and 
convicted of criminal negligence or carelessness, and a 
fine and prison sentence imposed. The attempt upon 
the part of society to punish the offender in this way 
was absolutely futile. He cared nothing about the fine 
or the imprisonment, but his realization that through 
careless performance of duty he had broken his trust 
and had really slain his fellow men came home to him 
with stunning reality as he looked upon the results of 
his carelessness. This realization lived in his heart 
night and day. It was the real prisoner and could not 
be freed from the man’s innermost thoughts and feel-
-P-A-G-E-353
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 339 
ings. The result of this constant reminder of his act 
drove him insane, and his body very soon had to be 
taken from the prison to which it had been committed 
and placed in an insane hospital. There he continued 
to live over and over in his mind the scene of the 
disaster, and the morbidness of his remorse was ex- 
pressed in the words, “Oh, if I only had not!” This 
refrain he repeated over and over almost constantly. 
Who could conceive of a greater punishment than he 
was doomed to suffer, not because of any judgment 
passed upon him by society, but because of his own 
realization of the real significance of what he had 
done? 
In another instance a man while under the influence 
of liquor shot and killed a man who had been his 
friend for many years. When he came to his senses 
and realized through the testimony of witnesses at the 
trial that he had really taken the life of his friend, he 
was overwhelmed with grief. He was sent to prison on 
a long-term sentence, but was soon paroled on good 
behavior. He returned to his home town and resumed 
his former trade. But he was a broken man. His per- 
sonal testimony was that the prison meant nothing to 
him, for it mattered little where his body was or what 
was done with it, but he said, “Night and day I see the 
face of my friend whom I killed, and realize that I am 
helpless to undo the deed.” His life was one continual 
hell of mental agony, none of which was produced by
-P-A-G-E-354
  340 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
anything done to him by society, but all of it due to 
his own realization of the significance of his deed. 
On the other hand is a case in which the offender 
was convicted and imprisoned for stealing a horse. 
This individual suffered the inconveniences of having 
his program of life restricted. He did not realize, how- 
ever, the real significance of his act as a principle in 
human conduct. Therefore he suffered no real punish- 
ment. He felt no agony of mind or compunction of 
feeling at all. He was perfectly indifferent and com- 
placent. He finally secured a parole on good behavior; 
but his freedom was short-lived, for he stole another 
horse and was again sent to prison to serve a full 
sentence. Society may have protected itself by sending 
this man to prison, but it failed to punish him and it 
failed to correct his thinking in regard to serious social 
problems. 
Still another case may be cited of an individual who 
was accused of embezzlement, tried, convicted, and 
sent to prison. This individual protested his innocence 
and refused to accept the judgment of society as a 
penalty for an offense that he claimed never to have 
committed. He suffered inconvenience and more or 
less of physical discomfort because of his imprison- 
ment, but he was not punished by any realization in 
his own thinking of having committed a wrong. 
Examples of these various types of actual situations 
could be multiplied innumerably. They all illustrate 
the one outstanding psychological truth, namely, that
-P-A-G-E-355
  
THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 341 
real punishment comes through realizing the signifi- 
cance of one’s deeds and realizing why the results are 
wrong and unsatisfactory because they are the outward 
expressions of a social principle that is not ideal. 
Therefore the point should be emphasized again and 
again that the function of the teacher is to help the 
pupil solve each situation in such a way that the pupil 
sets up in his own thinking the proper realization of 
the significance of his conduct as embodying wrong 
social principles. Then the pupil will be really and 
truly sorry and his inmost feelings will be all the pun- 
ishment possible to mete out to him. Any other 
attempt to punish must be temporary and transient in 
effect, as compared with this mental thorn of realiza- 
tion that he must carry in his heart continually. 
Moral imagination—One of the most important 
factors in developing a full realization of the signifi- 
cance of conduct is that of moral imagination. The 
individual who can not construct a vivid picture or 
image of the possible results of conduct prior to the 
performance itself will not be liable to realize the full 
significance of any act that he performs, for no act is 
significant except as it is related to other things that 
do not always appear in the immediate time of the act 
itself. The act must be associated with any number 
of other things, and this can be done only by the power 
of constructive moral imagination. Therefore one of 
the functions of the teacher should be to analyze the 
extent and character of the pupil’s moral imagination 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
Sa a ee es 
342 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
and to seek through the concrete cases of behavior 
that are unsatisfactory to develop the power and prac- 
tice of constructive moral imagination. In other words, 
the teacher should capitalize misbehavior as the great- 
est opportunity for doing vital work-in the develop- 
ment of conduct. 
The critical point is that the opal must not only 
possess the power of constructive moral imagination, 
but he must employ it in a sane way habitually so that 
he will not always be doing things for which he should 
apologize. The development of a reliable habit of 
| moral imagination is the goal of moral imagination. 
| The individual who allows his powers of moral imagi- 
| nation to run riot, to run in all sorts of fanciful, bizarre 
imaginings, will not be a dependable member of soci- 
ety. Such an individual will be as likely to commit 
errors of omission that are equally as detrimental to 
society as the errors of actual performances that he 
lives out. Therefore the individual must have ample 
opportunity to practise his moral imagination in con- 
nection with concrete cases of his own behavior and 
also in connection with concrete cases of behavior of 
the groups and of other individuals, for one of the 
fundamental laws of habit formation is that any per- 
formance must be carried on validly a number of times 
in order to set up and fully establish a habit path that 
will operate automatically in the face of the appropri- 
ate situation and stimulus.
-P-A-G-E-357
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 343 
The interpretation of behavior.—The teacher can 
not deal intelligently and effectively with the indi- 
vidual and group cases of behavior unless he is able 
accurately to interpret the various psychological and 
sociological factors that are involved in the various 
situations. He must know with some degree of assur- 
ance just what has gone on and is going on in the 
minds and hearts of the pupils who perform the acts 
that are not satisfactory. The interpretation, there- 
fore, involves a careful consideration of a number of 
facts and factors, and diagnostic tests are needed in 
this connection just as surely as they are needed in 
connection with any other phase of educational testing 
and measuring. 
The fundamental point for the teacher to keep in 
mind is that he should make the study of moral prob- 
lems just as impersonal as he does the study of mathe- 
matical or any other sort of subject-matter problems. 
The teacher should never take any act of the pupil as 
an affront to his personal dignity. The dealing with a 
problem of conduct should never be a mere clash of 
personalities. Personalities should be lost in the con- 
sideration of vital principles that are permanent and 
abiding. The manner of dealing with conduct should 
never manifest a spirit of vindictiveness. The teacher 
must be broad-minded enough to forget self and to 
study impersonally the status of the pupil’s mind and 
to make the pupil realize the real issue. This is the
-P-A-G-E-358
    344 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
only way that he can hope to arouse the right kind of 
moral imagination in the thinking of the pupil and to 
set up a permanent habit of appropriate behavior. 
The surest way to disarm the pupil, even if his act 
seems to be aimed at the teacher as an insult or per- 
sonal affront, is to ignore it from that standpoint, and 
to put the vital moral issues before the offender, and 
thus help the pupil to see what he is doing to himself. 
The teacher too often feels that he must vindicate him- 
self, that he must “get even” with the offender. Little 
does he realize, when he assumes this attitude, that in 
order to “get even” he must commit a similar act him- 
self and thus violate the vital moral principles of good 
conduct. The wholesome influence is to make the 
pupil realize that one does not want to get even, that 
one will not be dragged into a petty clash of personali- 
ties, but that one will insist upon keeping to the per- 
manent and abiding issues that have been set up as 
social ideals. 
The diagnostic tests employed by the teacher in 
interpreting the behavior of the adolescent pupil 
should involve a thorough consideration of the psychol- 
ogy of suggestion. Every individual is influenced to a 
great degree by suggestions of different types, but the 
adolescent is particularly susceptible to suggestions of 
the physiological, instinctive, and ideational types. 
Physiological stimuli, instinctive impulses, and spon- 
taneous ideas tend to be irresistible; hence these im~ 
pelling forces will be the dominating influences under-
-P-A-G-E-359
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 345 
lying very much of adolescent behavior. The particu- 
lar type of suggestion that is dominant in any particu- 
lar case of unsatisfactory conduct must be discovered 
before the case can be dealt with in a constructive 
manner. In order to make such accurate interpreta- 
tions of behavior that these various psychological fac- 
tors may be discovered definitely, the teacher must 
study the reactions of adolescent pupils in the re- 
sponses that they make to their social situations. 
Then, in the light of carefully conducted studies of 
this kind, the teacher should work out a thorough- 
going body of technique that will enable him to deal 
with individual and group cases effectively. 
Technique in dealing with conduct—A. Make the 
attitude of the pupil the center of attention and strive 
to direct the thinking of the pupil in such a way as to 
help him realize the social significance of his act. The 
pupil must come to a different attitude toward the 
social problem involved in his conduct if he is to profit 
by moral education. 
B. Never parade the conduct of the pupil before 
the school and never administer a moral educational 
measure publicly as an example to the rest of the 
pupils. Give the pupil an opportunity to work out his 
conduct problems through private personal confer- 
ences. Make the pupil feel the helpfulness of con- 
structive suggestions and advice just as in dealing with 
a problem in mathematics or language or any other 
subject. 
 
-P-A-G-E-360
346 TEACHING HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 
C. The teacher in the class-room, assembly hall, 
etc., should make the pupil feel that his presence and 
sympathetic watchfulness is just as helpful in over- 
coming weaknesses of conduct as it is in overcoming 
difficulties in other lessons. The watchfulness of the 
teacher should never take on the semblance of spying 
or policing. The attitude of the teacher’s alertness 
must express a friendly codperation and confidence in 
the integrity of the pupil. 
D. The misconduct of the pupil should not be re- 
garded as a crime any more than making an error in a 
geometry problem or in a language construction 
should be regarded as an offense against the instruc- 
tion given by the teacher. The fact that the pupil 
makes errors in dealing with any field of problems is 
what makes a teacher necessary. Therefore the com- 
mitting of an error of conduct presents the best oppor- 
tunity for doing constructive, vital work in moral edu- 
cation. Keep the idea uppermost that to make the 
undesirable desirable and the unlovely lovely is the 
function of training in conduct. In other words, take 
the point of view expressed by the Great Teacher in 
the saying: “I am come to seek and to save that which 
was lost.” 
#. Create clear conceptions in the minds of the 
pupils as to what constitutes helpful social standards 
of conduct in group life and what the conditions of 
good order and work really are under the school 
surroundings. Direct the pupils in setting up their
-P-A-G-E-361
  THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 347 
individual relationships to these standards and con- 
ditions. 
F. Direct the thinking of the pupil to his own 
responsibility in working out his program of behavior. 
Make him face the issue of his particular acts and 
require him to answer why he should or should not do 
such and such acts. Help him to realize that he should 
take himself to task and that he should direct his 
conduct in such a way as to make it contribute to the 
welfare of society instead of expecting the teacher to 
watch him and to assume the responsibility for his 
behavior. 
G. Set up the problems of group life clearly, and 
help the group to realize its responsibility toward its 
members as well as its responsibility toward the large 
social group of community or state. Discriminate 
carefully between problems that the group should solve 
in regard to the conduct of individual members of the 
group and the problems of individual conduct that 
each individual should solve for himself. Strive to 
create an appropriate group consciousness of moral re- 
sponsibility in regard to social problems. 
H. Rules and regulations should be worked out by 
the group. This procedure will insure a clear under- 
standing as to the function that each regulation is tc 
serve in promoting the welfare of the group and the 
welfare of the individual. This procedure will also go 
far toward developing the group consciousness of moral 
responsibility suggested above.

I, When several pupils have violated a rule or regu- 
lation in a serious way, deal with them individually 
instead of attempting to take up the problem with all 
of them at the same time. The personal conference is

be alert in observing the 
conduct of pupils and he should be accurate in his 
interpretations of their acts. Suggestion is a very 
powerful factor in determining behavior; hence the 
teacher should watch carefully the trend of the con- 
duct of individuals and of groups and should start 
strong counter-suggestions that will prevent much un- 
desirable behavior. 
K. Promptness of decision and action in dealing 
with conduct problems is Hat effective. 
L. The attitude of the teacher should express self- 
confidence and assurance as to the outcome of his 
procedure. The teacher should carry himself with 
appropriate dignity and firmness in the face of critical 
conduct situations. 
M. The teacher should not be supersensitive and 
not easily upset by aggravating occurrences. The 
teacher should view the 
impartial manner and not problems of conduct in an 
take the acts as being aimed 
at his personal authority or dignity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
THE PROBLEM OF CONDUCT 349 
SUMMARY 
The history of the human family exhibits two stages 
of character development—namely, the stage of exter- 
nal criteria and the stage of internal criteria—in its 
moral education. These two stages of conduct develop- 
ment are dominated by two distinct philosophies of 
morality. The one is the philosophy of obedience 
through fear, while the other is the philosophy of love. 
The first stage and the first philosophy dominates 
childhood. The second stage and the second philos- 
ophy dominates adult life. Both stages and both 
philosophies are present during adolescence and the 
great problem is to render the second stage and philos- 
ophy dominant. 
Constructive education is the road to character- 
building, and a study of actual social situations in their 
own lives is necessary to give the pupils an under- 
standing of the significance of social ideals. Pupils 
must be made to feel responsible for changing unsatis- 
factory conditions. Teachers should look upon every 
act of misbehavior as an opportunity for constructive 
education; hence he should study the psychological 
and sociological factors involved in each piece of con- 
duct. He should never look upon the conduct of the 
pupil as an affront to his personal dignity. The pun- 
ishment for any offense must ultimately rest in the 
individual’s realization of the significance of his act.

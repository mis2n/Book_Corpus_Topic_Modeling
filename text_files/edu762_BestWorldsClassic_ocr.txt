IN PRAISE OF BOOKS? ©" 
Tus desirable treasure of wisdom'and knowl- 
edge, which all men covet from the impulse. of 
nature, infinitely surpasses all the riches of the 
world; in comparison with which, precious stones - 
are vile, silver is clay, and purified gold grains 
of sand; in the splendor of which, the sun and 
moon grow dim to the sight; in the admirable 
sweetness of which, honey and manna’ are' bitter, 
to the taste. The value of wisdom decreaseth 
not with time; it hath an ever-flourishing virtue 
that cleanseth its possession from every venom. 
O celestial gift of divine liberality, descending 
from the Father of light to raise up the rational 
soul even to heaven; thou art the ‘celestial ‘ali- 
mony of intellect, of which whosoever. eateth 
shall yet hunger, and whoso drinketh shall yet

  thirst; & harmony rejoicing the soul of the sor- 
_ ~rowful, and never in any way discomposing the 
hearer. Thou art the moderator an@ the rule 
of morals, operating according to vuich none 
err. By thee kings reign, and lawgivers deeree 
justly. Through thee, rusticity of nature being 
east off, wits and tongues being polished, and the 
thorns of vice utterly eradicated, the.summit of 
'. honor is. reached and they become fathers of 
their country and companions of princes, who, 
without thee, might have forged their lances into 
spades and plowshares, or perhaps have fed swine 
with the prodigal son. 
Where, then, most. potent, most longed-for 
treasure, art thou concealed? and where shall the 
thirsty soul find thee? Undoubtedly, indeed, 
thou hast: placed thy desirable tabernacle in 
books, where the Most High, the Light of light, 
the Book.of. Life, hath established thee. There 
. then all who ask receive, all who seek find thee, 
.,to those who knock thou openest quickly. In 
: books Cherubim expand their wings, that the 
soul of the student may ascend and look around 
from pole to pole, fromthe rising to the setting 
sun, from the north and from the south. In them 
the Most High, Incomprehensible God himself is 
contained and worshiped. In them the nature 
of celestial, terrestrial, and infernal beings is 
laid open. In them the laws by which every 
“, polity is governed. are decreed, the offices of the 
:’ ‘eelestial hierarchy are distinguished, and tyr- 
'annies of such demons are described as the ideas 
of Plato never surpassed, and the chair of Crito 
never sustained. . 
In ‘books we find the dead as it were living;

  RICHARD DE BURY 
  in books we foresee things to come; in’ books 
warlike affairs are methodized; the rights of 
peace proceed from books. All things are cor- 
rupted and decay with time. Satan never ceases 
to devour those whom he generates, insomuch 
that the glory of the world would be lost in 
oblivion, if God had not provided mortals with 
a remedy in books. Alexander, the ruler of the 
world; Julius,” the invader of the world and the 
city, the first who in unity of person assumed 
the empire in arms and arts; the faithful Fabri- 
cius, the rigid Cato, would at this day have 
been without a memorial if the aid of books had 
failed them. ‘Towers are razed to the earth, 
cities overthrown, triumphal arches moldered to 
dust; nor can the king or pope be found, upon 
whom the privilege of a lasting name can 
conferred more easily than by books. A book 
made renders succession to the author; for as 
long as the book exists, the author, remaining 
immortal, can not perish; as Ptolemy witnesseth ; 
in the prolog of his Almagest,* he (he says) 
is not dead, who gave life to science. 
What learned seribe, therefore, who draws out 
things new and old from an infinite treasury of 
books, will limit their price by any other thing 
whatsoever of another kind? Truth, overcoming 
all things, which ranks above kings, wine, and 
women, to honor which above friends obtains the

    benefit of sanctity, which is the way that deviates 
not, and the life without end, to which the holy 
Bothius attributes a threefold existence in the 
mind, in the voice, and in writing, appears to 
abide most usefully and fructify most produe- 
tively of advantage in books. For the truth of 
‘the voice perishes with the sound. Truth, latent 
in the mind, is hidden wisdom and invisible 
treasure; but the truth which illuminates books, 
desires to manifest itself to every disciplinable 
sense, to the sight when read, to the hearing 
when Heard ; it, moreover, in a manner commends 
itself to the touch, when submitting to be tran- 
seribed, collated, corrected, and preserved. Truth 
confined to the mind, tho it may be the possession 
of a noble soul, while it wants a companion and 
is not’ judged of, either by the sight or the 
hearing, appears to be inconsistent with pleasure. 
: But-the truth of the voice is open to the hearing 
only, and latent to the sight (which shows as 
many differences of things fixt upon by a most 
subtle motion, beginning and ending as it were 
simultaneously. But the truth written in a book 
being not fluctuating, but permanent, shows itself 
openly to the sight passing through the spiritual 
ways of the eyes, as the porches and halls of 
common sense and imagination; it enters the 
‘chamber of intellect, reposes itself upon the couch 
of memory, and there eongenerates the eternal 
truth of the mind. 
Lastly, let us consider how great a commodity 
of doctrine exists in books, how easily, how se- eretly, how safely they expose the nakedness of . 
human ignorance without putting it to shame. 
These are the masters that instruct us without

wend many ways, both on sea and land, after

‘them come to one end. But trow not that I will

long a tale; but all only some countries and 
most principal steads that men shall go through 
to Fete right way.

or Norway, he may, if that he will, go through

  SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE 
  And the King of Hungary is a great lord and 
a mighty, and holds great lordships and much 
land in his hand. For he holds the kingdom of 
Hungary; Sclavonia, and of Comania a great 
part, and of Bulgaria that men eall the land of 
Bougiers, and of the realm of Russia a great 
part, whereof he has made a duchy, that lasts 
unto the land of Nyfland, and marches to Prus- 
sia. And men go through the land of this lord, 
through a city that is called Cypron,‘ and by 
the castle of Neasburghe, and by the evil town, 
that sit toward the end of Hungary. And there 
pass men the river Danube. This river of Dan- 
ube is a full great river, and it goeth into 
Almayne, under the hills of Lombardy, and it 
receives into him forty other rivers, and it runs 
through Hungary and through Greece and 
through Thrace, and it enters into the sea, to- 
ward the east so rudely and so sharply, that the 
water of the sea is fresh and holds its sweetness 
twenty mile within the sea. 
And after, go men to Belgrade, and enter into 
the land of Bourgiers; and there pass men a 
bridge of stone that is upon the river of Marrok.’ 
And men pass through the land of Pyncemartz 
and come to Greece to the city of Nye, and to 
the city of Fynepape,’ and after to the eity of 
Dadrenoble,’ and after to Constantinople, that

there is-the most fair church and the most noble 
of all-the world; and it.is of Saint Sophie. And 
before that church is the image of Justinian the 
emperor, covered with gold, and he sits upon a 
herse erowned. And he was wont to hold a round 
apple of gold in his hand; but it is fallen out 
. thereof. And men say there, that it is a token 
that. the emperor has lost a great part of his 
lands and of his lordships; for he was wont to 
be Emperor of Roumania and of Greece, of all 
Asia the less, and of the land of Syria, of the 
land of Judea in the which is Jerusalem, and 
of the land of Egypt, of Persia, and of Arabia. 
But he has lost all but Greece; and that land 
he holds ‘all only. And men would many times 
put the apple into the image’s hand again, but 
it will.not hold it. This apple betokens the lord- 
ship that he had over all the world, that is round. 
And the other hand he lifts up against the Hast,

AT THE COURT OF THE GREAT CHAN?’ 
Tur men of Tartary have. let make another 
eity that is called Caydon. And it has. twelve 
gates, and between the two gates there is always 
a great mile; so that the two cities, that. is to - 
say, the old and the new, have in ‘cirenit. more 
than twenty mile. 
In this city is the court of the great Chan i in 
a full great palace and the most passing fair i : 
all the world, of the which the walls be in cis 
cuit more than two mile. And within the walls 
it is full of other palaces. And inthe garden 
of the great palace there is a great hill, upon 
the which there is another palace; and it is the 
most fair and the most rich that any man may 
devise. And all about the palace and the hill 
be many trees bearing many diverse fruits. And 
all about the hill be ditches great and deep, and 
beside them be great fish ponds on that.one part 
and on that other. And there is a full fair 
bridge to pass over the ditches. And in these 
vivaries be so many wild geese and ganders 
and wild ducks and swans and herons that it 
is without number. And all about these ditches 
and vivaries is the great garden full of wild 
beasts. So that when the great Chan will have 
any disport on that, to take any of the wild 
beasts or of the fowls, he will let chase them and

  take them at the windows without going out of 
his chamber. 
This palace, where his court is, is both great 
and passing fair. And within the palace, in the 
hall, there be twenty-four pillars of fine gold. 
And all the walls be covered. within of red skins 
of beasts that men call panthers, that be fair 
peasts and well smelling; so that for the sweet 
odor of those skins no evil air may enter into 
the palace. Those skins be as red as blood, and 
they shine so bright against the sun, that seareely 
no man may behold them. And many folk wor- 
ship these beasts, when they meet them first at 
morning, for their great virtue and for the good 
smell that they have. And those skins they prize 
more than-tho they were plate of fine gold. 
And in’ the midst of this palace is the reservoir 
for the gréat Chan, that is all wrought of gold 
and ‘of precious stones and great pearls. And 
at four eorners of the reservoir be four serpents 
of gold.. And all’about there is made large nets 
of silk and gold and great pearls hanging all 
about the reservoir. And under the reservoir 
be conduits of beverage that they drink in the 
emperor’s court. And beside the conduits be 
many vessels of gold, by the which they that be 
of household drink at the conduit. 
, «And the hall of the palace is full nobly ar- 
rayed, and full marvellously attired on all parts 
‘in all things that men apparel with any hall. 
And first, at the chief of the hall is the em- 
peror’s throne, full high, where he sits at the 
meat, And that is of fine precious stones, bor- 
_ dered all about with pure gold and precious 
stones, and great pearls. And the steps that he

  goes up to the table be of precious stones mingled 
with gold. 
And at the left side of the emperor’s seat is 
the seat of his first wife, one degree lower than 
the emperor; and it is of jasper, bordered with 
gold and precious stones. And the seat. of his 
second wife is also another seat more.lower than 
his first wife; and it is also of jasper, bordered 
with gold, as that other is. And the seat of 
the third wife is also more low, by a degree, than 
the second wife. For he has always three. wives 
with him, where that ever he be. 
And after his wives, on the’ same Bide, sit the 
ladies of his lineage yet lower, after that they 
be of estate. And all those that be married have 
a counterfeit made like a man’s foot upon their 
heads, a cubit long, all wrought with great pearls, 
fine and orient, and above made with peacocks” 
feathers and of other shining feathers; and that 
stands upon their heads like a crest, in token 
that they be under man’s foot and under sub- 
jection of man. And they | that be unmarried 
have none such.” 
20 ‘The ‘quaint words in which “Mandeville” concludes his 
book are these: ‘And I, John Mandeville, knight, above 
said (altho I be unworthy), that departed from our coun- 
tries and passed the sea, the year of grace s thousand 
three hundred and twenty-two, that have passed many lands 
and many isles and countries, and searched man: fu 
strange places, and have been in many a full goo

that I did none myself, for mine unable insuffisance), now 
I am come home, in spite of myself, to rest, for gouts

OF ACQUIRING AND USING RICHES* 
Wuen Prudence had heard her husband avaunt — 
himself of his riches and of his money, dis-~ 
paraging the power of his adversaries, she spake 
and said in this. wise: Certes, dear sir, I grant 
you that ye are rich and mighty, and that riches 
are good to ’em that have well obtained ’em, 
and that well ean use’em; for, just as the hody 
of a man may not live without soul, no more may 
it live without temporal goods, and by richés may 
a man get him great friends; and therefore saith 
Pamphilus: If a neatherd’s daughter be rich, she |. 
may chose of a thousand men which she will take 
to her husband; for of a thousand men one will 
not forsake her nor refuse her. And this Pam- . 
philus saith also: If thou be right happy, that 
is to say, if thou be right rich, thou shalt: find 
a great number of fellows and friends; and’ if: 
thy fortune change, that thou wax poor, farewell 
friendship and fellowship, for thou shalt bé all

is too desiring to get riches abandoneth him first 
to theft and to all other evils; and therefore 
saith Solomon: He that hasteth him too busily 
to wax rich, he shall be nof innocent: -he saith 
also, that the riches that hastily cometh to.a man 
soon lightly goeth and passeth from a. min, but 
that riches that cometh little and tittle waxeth 
alway and multiplieth. And, sir, ye should get 
riches by your wit and by your travail, unto 
your profit, and that without. wrong or harm 
doing to any other person; for the law saith: 
There maketh no man himself rich, if he do harm | 
to another wight; that is to say,’ that Nature 
defendeth and forbiddeth by right, that. no mati 
make himself rich unto the harm of another: 
person. , , 
And Tullius® saith: That no sorrow, no dread 
of death, nothing that may fall. unto a man, is 
so much against nature as a man to increase his 
owyn profit to harm of another man. And though 
the great men and the mighty men get. riches 
more lightly than thou, yet shalt thou not be idle 
nor slow to do thy profit, for thou shalt in all 
wise flee idleness; for Solomon saith: That idle- 
ness teacheth a man to do many evils; and the 
same Solomon saith: That he that travaileth and 
busieth himself to till his land, shall eat: bread, 
but he that is idle, and casteth him to no busi- 
ness nor o¢eupation, shall fall into poverty, and 
die for hunger. And he that is idle and slow can 
never find convenient time for to do his profit; 
for there is a versifier who saith, that the idle 
man excuseth him in winter because of the great 
eold, and in summer then by reagon of the heat,

  ' For-these causes, saith Cato, waketh and inclineth 
you not over much to sleep, for over much rest 
noutisheth and causeth many vices; and therefore 
‘saith St. Jerome: Do some good deeds, that the 
‘devil, which is our enemy, find you not unoc- 
-/eupied, for the devil he taketh not lightly unto 
‘his working such as he findeth occupied in good 
“works. . 
Then thus in getting riches ye must flee idle- 
ness; and afterward ye should use the riches 
which ye have got by your wit and by your 
travail, in such manner, that men hold you not 
too scarce, nor too sparing, nor fool-large, that 
is to say, over large a spender; for right as men 
blame an avaricious man because of his scarcity 
and niggardliness, in the same wise he is to blame 
that spendeth over largely; and therefore saith 
_ Cato: Use (saith he) the riches that thou hast 
obtained in such manner, that men have no mat- 
ter nor’ cause to call thee neither wretch nor 
‘-miser, for it is ‘a great shame to a man to have 
a poor heart and a rich purse; he saith also: The 
goods that thou hast obtained, use ’em by meas- 
ure, that is to say, spend measurably, for they 
that foolishly waste and squander the goods that 
they have, when they have no more proper of 
’eir own, that they prepare to take the goods of 
another man. I say, then, that ye should flee 
avarice, using your riches in such manner, that 
men say not that your riches are buried, but that .ye have *em in your might and in your wielding; 
fora wise man reproveth the avaricious man, 
and saith thus in two verse: Whereto and why burieth a man his goods by his great avarice.

  death is the end of every man as in this present

And for what cause or reason joineth he, him, 
or knitteth he him so fast unto his. goods, that 
all hig wits will not dissever him or’depart him 
from his goods, and knoweth well, or ought to 
know, that when he is dead he shall nothing 
bear with him out of this world? And therefore 
saith St. Augustine, that the avaricious man is 
likened unto hell, that’ the more it swalloweth 
the more desire it hath to swallow and devour. 
And as well as ye would eschew to ‘be’ called an, 
avaricious man or a chineh, as well should: ye 
keep you and govern you in such wise, that! men “ 
call you not fool-large; therefore, saith Tullius: . 
The goods of thine house ‘should not be hid nor 
kept so close, but that they might be opened by 
pity and debonnairety, that is to say, to give 
‘em part that have great need; but the. goods 
should not be so open to be every man’s’ goods.

OF TRUE NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY* 
Tu knight ought to be made all armed upon an 
apt horse, in such wise that he have an helmet 
on his head, and a spear in his right hand, and 
covered with his shield; a sword and a mace on 
his. left side; clad with an hauberk and plates 
before his bréast; leg harness on his legs; spurs 
on his heels; on his hands his gauntlets. His 
horse well broken and taught, and apt to battle, 
and covered with his arms. When the knights 
_ be made they be bayned or bathed. That is the 
- sign that they should lead a new life and new 
manners; also they wake all the night in prayers 
and orisons unto God that he will give them 
grace that they may get that thing that they 
may not get by nature. The king or prince 
girdeth about them a sword, in sign that they 
should abide and keep him of whom they take 
,. their dispences and dignity. 
Also a knight ought to be wise, liberal, true, 
strong, and full of mercy and pity, and keeper 
of the people, and of the law, and right as chiv- 
alry passeth other in virtue, in dignity, in honor, 
1¥From the “Game and Playe of Chesse,” translated by Caxton from the French original. 
22
-P-A-G-E-32
  WILLIAM CAXTON 
  and in reverence, right so ought he to surmount 
all other in virtue; for honor is nothing else but 
to do reverence to another person for the good 
and virtuous disposition that is in him. A noble 
knight ought to be wise and proved before he be 
made knight; it behoveth him that he had long 
time used the war and arms; that he may be 
expert and wise for to govern others. . For since 
a knight is captain of a battle, the life of them 
that shall be under him lieth in his hand, and 
therefore behooveth him to be wise and well ad- 
vised. For sometimes art, craft and engine is 
more worth than strength of hardiness of a.man 
that is not proved in arms, for otherwhile it hap- 
peneth that when the prince of the baitle relies 
on and trusteth in his hardiness and strength, 
and will not use wisdom and engine for to run 
upon his enemies, he is vanquished and his peo- 
ple slain. Therefore saith the philosopher that 
no man should choose young people to be captains 
and governors, forasmuch as there is no cer- 
tainty in their wisdom. Alexander of Macedon 
vanquished and conquered Egypt, Judea, Chal- 
dee, Africa, and Assyria unto the marches of 
Bragmans more by the counsel of old men than 
by the strength of the young men. 
The very true love of the common weal and 
profit nowadays is seldom found. Where shalt 
thou find a man in these days that will expose 
himself for the worship and honor of his friend 
or for the eommon weal. Seldom or never shall 
he be found. Also the knights should be large 
and liberal, for when a knight hath regard unto 
his singular profit by his covetousness, he de- 
spoileth his people. For when the soldiers see 
23
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  that they put them in peril, and their master 
will mot pay them their wages. liberally, but in- 
terdéth to his own proper gain and profit, then, 
when ‘the enemies come, they turn soon their 
‘baeks and flee oftentimes. And thus it hap- 
peneth by him that intendeth more to get money 
‘thar victory, that his avarice is ofttimes cause 
of his. confusion. 
Then let every knight take heed to be liberal, 
in ‘such wise that he ween not nor suppose that 
his seareity be to him a great winning or gain. 
And for this eause he be the less loved of his 
people, and that his adversary withdraw to him 
them by large giving. For ofttime battle is ad- 
vanced .more for getting of silver than by the 
foree, and strength of men. For men see all day 
that such things as may not be achieved by force 
of nature be gotten and achieved by force of 
-mioney. And forsomuch it behooveth to see well 
 to'that -when the time of battle cometh, that he 
borrow not, nor make no curtailment. For no 
man may be rich that leaveth his own, hoping 
to get and take of others. Then alway all their 
gain, and winning ought to be common among 
them exeept their arms. For in like wise as the 
victory is common, so should the despoil and 
booty be common unto them. And ‘therefore 
David, that gentle knight in the first book of 
Kings in the last chapter, made a law: that he 
that abode behind by malady or sickness in the 
‘tents should have as much part of the booty as 
he that had been in the battle. And for the love 
of this law he was made afterward king of Israel. - Alexander of Macedon came in a time like a simple knight unto the court of Porus, king of

WILLIAM CAXTON. 
  Ind, for to espy the estate of the king and of 
the knights of the court.. And the king received 
him right worshipfully and demanded many 
things of Alexander and. of his constancy and 
strength, nothing weening that he had been Alex- 
ander, but Antigone, one of his knights. And 
after he had him to dinner; and when.they had 
served Alexander in vessel of goid and silver 
with diverse meats, after that he had eaten such 
as pleased him, he voided the meat and took the 
vessel and held it to himself and put it in-his bosom 
or sleeves. Whereof he was aceused. unto the 
king. After dinner then the king called him and. 
demanded wherefore he had taken his vessel, and 
he answered: Sir King, my lord, I pray thee to 
understand and take heed thyself and also thy 
knights. I have heard much of thy great high- 
ness, and that thou art more mighty and puissant 
in chivalry and in dispences than is Alexander, 
and therefore I am come to thee, a poor knight, 
which am named Antigone, for to serve thee. 
Then it is the custom in the court of Alexander 
that what thing a knight is served with, all is 
his, meat and vessel and cup. And therefore 
I had supposed that this custom had been’ kept 
in thy court, for thou art richer than he. When 
the knights heard this, anon they left Porns, and 
went to serve Alexander, and thus he drew to him 
the hearts of them by gifts, which afterward slew 
Porus that was king of Ind, and they made Alex- 
ander king thereof. Therefore remember, knight, 
alway that with a closed and shut purse thou 
shalt never have victory. Ovid saith that he that 
taketh gifts, he is glad therewith, for they wir 
with gifts the hearts of the gods and of men.

said Merlin unto the King, ‘‘yonder is the sword 
that I spake of.’’ 
With that they saw a damsel going upon the

‘fand within that lake is a reach, and therein 
is as fair a place as any is on earth, and richly

  King Arthur, and saluted him, and he her again. 
“‘Damsel,’’ said the King, ‘‘what sword is that 
which the arm holdeth yonder above the water? 
I would it were mine, for I have no sword.’’ 
“Sir King,’’ said the damsel of the lake, ‘‘that 
sword is mine, and if ye will give me a gift when 
T ask it you, ye shall have it.’’ ‘‘By my faith,’’ 
said King Arthur, ‘‘I will give you any gift that 
you will ask or desire.’’ ‘‘Well,’’ said the dam- 
sel, ‘‘go ye into yonder barge, and row yourself 
unto the sword, and take it and the seabbard 
with you; and I will ask my gift when I see 
my time.’’ Cs 
So King Arthur and Merlin alighted, tied their 
horses to two trees, and so they went into the 
barge. And when they came to the sword that 
the hand held, King Arthur took it up by the 
handles, and took it with him; and the arm and 
the hand went under the water,.and so came to 
the land and rode forth. : 
Then King Arthur saw a rich pavilion. ‘‘What 
signifieth yonder pavilion??? ‘‘That is the 
Inight’s pavilion that ye fought with last—Sir 
Pellinore; but he is out; for he is not there: he 
hath had to do with a knight of yours, that hight 
Egiame, and they have foughten together a great. 
while, but at the last Eglame fled, and else he had 
been dead; and Sir Pellinore hath chased him 
to Carlion, and we shall anon meet with him in 
the highway.’’ ‘It is well said,’’ quoth King 
Arthur; ‘‘now have I a sword, and now will I 
wage battle with him and be avenged on him.’’ 
“Sir, ye shall not do so,’’ said Merlin: ‘‘for 
the knight is weary of fighting and chasing; so

“When I see him,’’ said King Arthur, ‘‘I will 
do.as ye advise me.’’ 
Then King Arthur looked upon the sword and 
liked it- passing well: ‘‘Whether liketh you 
bétter,’’ said Merlin, ‘‘the sword or the scab- 
bard??? ‘‘Me liketh better the sword,’’ said 
King Arthur. ‘‘Ye are more unwise,’’ said Mer- 
lin; ‘‘for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword: 
for while ye have the scabbard upon you, ye 
shall lose no blood, be ye never so sore wounded— 
therefore keep well the scabbard alway with

Tuere are fifty-four cities in the island, all 
large and well built, the manners, customs, and 
laws of which are the same, and they are all 
econtrived_as near in the same manner as the 
ground on which they stand will allow. The 
nearest lie at least twenty-four miles’ distance 
from one another, and the most remote are not 
so far distant but that a man can go on foot in 
one day from it to that which lies next it. Every 
city sends three of their wisest senators once a 
year to Amaurot, to consult about their common 
concerns; for that is the chief town of the island, 
being situated near the center of it, so that it

  is the most convenient place for their assemblies. 
The jurisdiction of every city extends at least 
twenty miles; and where the towns lie wider, 
they have much more ground. No town desires 
to ‘enlarge its bounds, for the people “consider 
'< ¢hemselves rather as tenants than landlords. 
They have built, over all the country, farm- 
houses for husbandmen; which are well contrived, 
and furnished with all things necessary for coun- 
try Jabor. Inhabitants are sent, by turns, from 
the cities to dwell in them; no country family 
has fewer than forty men and women in it, be- 
sides two slaves. There is.a master and a mis- 
tress set over every family, and over thirty fam- 
ilies there is a magistrate. Every year twenty of 
this family eome back’ to the town after they 
have stayed two years in the country, and in 
“their room there are other twenty sent from the 
‘town, that they. may learn country work from 
those that have been already one year in the 
country, as they must teach those that come to 
them the next from the town. By this means 
such as dwell in those country farms are never 
ignorant of agriculture,!and so commit tio errors 
which might otherwise be fatal and bring them 
under a scarcity of corn. But tho there is every 
year such a shifting of the husbandmen, to pre- 
vent any man being forced against his will to 
follow that hard course of life too long, yet many 
among them take such pleasure in it that they 
desire leave to continue in it many years.

ploy oxen. For tho their horses are stronger, 
yet they find oxen can hold out longer; and_as. 
they are not subject to so many diseases, so they 
are kept upon a less charge and with less trouble. 
And even when they are so worn out that they 
are no more fit for labor, they are good meat at 
last. They sow no corn but that which is to 
be their bread: for they drink either wine, cider, 
or perry, and often water, sometimes boiled with 
honey or licorice, with which they abound; and 
tho they know exactly how much corn will serve 
every town and all that tract of country which 
belongs to it, yet they sow much more, and breed 
more catile, than are necessary for their con- 
sumption, and they give that overplus of which 
they make no use to their neighbors. 
When they want anything in the country which 
it does not produce, they fetch that from the 
town, without carrying anything in exchange for 
it. And the magistrates of the town-take care 
to see it given them; for they meet generally in 
the town once a month, upon a festival day.

He that knows one of their towns knows them

‘the situation. makes some difference. I shall 
therefore describe one of them, and none is so

It lies upon the side of a hill, or rather a rising 
ground. «Its. figure is almost square: for from 
the one side of it, which shoots up almost to the 
top of. the hill, it runs down in a descent for 
two miles, to the river Anider; but it is a little 
broader the other way that runs along by the 
bank of that river. The Anider rises about 
eighty miles. above Amaurot, in a small spring 
at first. But other: brooks falling into it, of 
which two are more considerable than the rest, 
as it rans by Amaurot it is grown half a mile 
broad; but it still grows larger and larger, till 
after sixty. miles’ course below it, it is lost in 
the ocean. Between the town and the sea, and 
for some miles above the town, it ebbs and flows 
every six hours with a strong current. The tide 
comes up about thirty miles so full that there 
is nothing but salt water in the river, the fresh 
water being driven back with its force; and above 
that, for some miles, the water is brackish; but 
a little higher, as it runs by the town, it is quite

  fresh; and when the tide ebbs, it continues fresh 
all along to the sea. There is a bridge cast over’ 
the river, not of timber, but. of fair stone, con- 
sisting of many stately arches; it lies at. that 
part of the town which is farthest from the sea, 
so that the ships, without any hindrance, lie all 
along the side of the town. . 
There is likewise another river that runs by 
it, which, tho it is not great, yet it runs pleas- 
anily, for it rises out of the same hill .on’which 
the town stands, and so runs down through it 
and falls into the Anider. The inhabitants have 
fortified the fountain-head of this river, which 
springs a little without the towns; that so, if 
they should happen to be besieged, the enemy 
might not be able to stop or divert the course of 
the water, nor poison it; from thence it is carried 
in earthen pipes to the lower streets. And for” 
those places of the town to which the water of 
that smali river can not be conveyed, they have 
great cisterns for receiving the rain-water, which 
supplies the want of the other. . . 
The town is compassed with a high and thick. 
wall, in which there are. many towers and forts; 
there is also a broad and deep dry ditch, set 
thick with thorns, cast round three sides of the 
town, and the river is instead of a ditch onthe 
fourth side. The streets are very convenient for 
all carriage, and are well sheltered from the 
winds. Their buildings are good;..and are so 
uniform that a whole side of a street looks like 
one hoyse. The streets are twenty. feet broad. 
There lie gardens behind all. their houses;. these 
are large, but inclosed with: buildings, that om 
all hands face the streets, so. that every house

that I have offered unto you no just occasion to

your majesty’s tears, rather than hurt my con-

Herewith was the queen more offended, and 
eommanded the said John to pass forth of the 
cabinet, and to abide further’ of her pleasure in 
the chamber. The Laird of..Dun ‘tarried, and 
Lord John of Coldingham came into the cabinet, 
and so they both remained with her near the 
space of an hour. The said John stood in the ~ : 
chamber, as one whom men had never seen—so 
were all effrayed—except that the Lord Ochiltree 
bare him company; and therefore began he to 
forge talking of the ladies, who were there sitting

pure clean wit of a sweet young babe is like the 
newest wax, most. able to receive the best and 
fairest printing; and like a new bright silver 
dish never ocqupied, to receive and keep clean 
any good thing that is put into it. 
And thus, will in children, wisely’ wrought 
withal, may easily be won to be very well willing 
to learn. And wit in children, by nature, namely 
memory, the only key and keeper of all learning, 
is readiest to receive and surest to keep any 
manner of thing that is learned in youth. This, 
lewd and learned, by common experience know to 
be most true. For we remember nothing so well 
when we be old as those things which we learned 
when we were young. And this is not strange, 
but common in all nature’s works. ‘Every man 
seeth (as I said before) new wax is best for 
printing, new clay fittest for working, new-shorn 
wool aptest- for soon ‘and surest dyeing, new 
fresh flesh for good and durable salting.’? And 
this similitude is not rude, nor borrowed of the 
larder-house, but out of his school-house, of whom 
the wisest of England need not be ashamed to 
learn. ‘‘Young grafts grow not only soonest,. 
but also fairest, and bring always forth the best — 
and sweetest fruit; young whelps learn easily 
to earry; young popinjays learn quickly to 
speak.’? And so, to be short, if in all other 
things, tho they lack reason, sense, and life, the 
similitude of youth is fittest to all goodness, 
surely nature in mankind is most beneficial and 
effectual in their behalf. oo. 
_ Therefore, if to the goodness of nature he 
joined the wisdom of the teacher, in leading 
young wits into a right and plain way of learn- 
41

  ing;. surely children kept up in God’s fear, and 
governed by His grace, may most easily be 
brought well to serve God and their country, 
both by virtue and wisdom. 
But if will and wit, by farther age, be once 
_./allured from innoceney, delighted in vain sights, 
“filed with foul talk, crooked with wilfulness, 
hardened with stubbornness, and let loose to dis- 
obedience; surely it is hard with gentleness, but 
impossible with severe cruelty, to call them back 
to good frame again. For where the one per- 
chance may bend it, the other shall surely break 
it: and so, instead of some hope, leave an as- 
sured desperation, and shameless contempt of 
all goodness; the furthest point in all. mischief, 
as Xenophon doth most truly and most wittily 
mark, : 
. Therefore, to love or to hate, to like or to 
conten, to ply this way or that way to good or 
to bad, ye shall have as ye use a child in his 
"youth. 
And one example whether love or fear doth 
work more in a child for virtue and learning, 
I will gladly report; which may be heard with 
some pleasure, and followed with more profit. 
Before I went into Germany, I came to Broad-

such pastime in the park? Smiling she answered 
me: ‘T wisse, all their sport in the park is but 
a shadow to that pleasure that I find in Plato. 
Alas! good folk, they never felt what true pleas- 
ure meant.’? ‘And how came you, madame,’’ 
quoth I, ‘‘to this deep knowledge of pleasure? 
and what did chiefly allure you unio it, seeing 
not many women, but very few men, have at- 
tained thereunto??? ‘‘I will tell you,’’ quoth 
she, ‘‘and tell you a truth, which perchance ye 
will marvel at. One of the greatest benefits that 
ever God gave me, is, that He sent me so sharp 
and severe parents, and so gentle a schoolmaster. 
For when I am in presence either of father or 
mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit, stand, 
or go, eat, drink, be merry, or sad, be sewing, 
playing, dancing, or doing anything else, I must 
do it, as it were, in such weight, measure, and

in hell, till time come that I must go to Mr. 
Elmer; who teacheth me so gently, so pleasantly, 
with such fair allurements to learning, that I 
think all the time nothing whiles I am with him.

‘and of you all; and I heartily desire you 
alto pray for me. The Lord have mercy on

eeled down, saying, ‘‘To Christ I commend 
y soul; Jesus, receive my soul,’’ repeating the 
game divers times, till at length the stroke was 
given, and her head was stricken off. 
“And this was the end of that godly lady and 
‘queen. Godly I call her, for sundry respects, 
‘whatsoever the cause was, or quarrel objected 
against her. ‘First, her last words, spoken at 
her death, declared no less her sincere faith and 
trust in Christ than did her quiet modesty utter 
forth the goodness of the cause and matter, what- 
soever jit, was. Besides that, to such as wisely 
ean judge upon cases occurrent, this also may 
_ ‘seem to give a great clearing unto her, that the 
king, the third day after, was married in his 
whites unto another. Certain this was, that for 
“the rare and singular gifts of her mind, so well 
instructed, and given toward God, with such a 
fervent desire unto the truth, and setting forth 
of sincere religion, joined with like gentleness, 
modesty, and pity toward all men, there have not 
many such queens before her borne the crown 
of England. Principally, this one commendation 
she left behind her, that, during her life, the 
religion of Christ most happily flourished, and 
_ bhad.a right prosperous course. 
Many things might be written more of the 
manifold virtues, and the quiet moderation of 
her mild nature; how lowly she would bear, not 
only to be admonished, but also of her own ac- 
cord would require her chaplains plainly and

  freely to tell whatsoever they saw in her amiss. 
Also, how bountiful she was to the poor, passing 
not only the poor example of other queens, but 
also the revenues almost of her estate: insomuch 
that the alms which she gave in three-quarters 
of a year, in distribution, is summed to the num- 
ber of fourteen: or fifteen thousand pounds; be- 
sides the great piece of money whieh her Grace 
intended to impart into four sundry quarters of 
the realm, as for a stock, there to be employed 
to the behoof of poor artificers and oceupiers. 
Again, what a zealous defender she’ was of 
Christ’s gospel all the world doth know, and her | 
acts do and will déclare to the world’s end. 
Amongst which other her acts, this is one, that 
she placed Master Hugh Latimer in the bishopric 
of Worcester, and also preferred Dr. Sharton to 
his bishopric, being then accounted a good man. 
Furthermore, what a true faith she bore unto 
the Lord, this one example may stand for many: . 
for that, when King Henry was with her at 
Woodstock,” and there being afraid of an old 
blind prophecy, for the which neither he nor, 
other kings before him durst hunt in the said 
park of Woodstock, nor enter into the town of 
Oxford, at last, through the Christian and faith- 
ful counsel of that queen, he was so armed 
against all infidelity, that both he hunted in the

Ir we truly examine the difference of both con- 
ditions—to wit, of the rich and mighty, whom we. 
eall fortunate, and of the poor and opprest, whom 
we count wretched—we shall find the happiness. 
of the one, and the miserable estate of the other, 
so tied by. God to the very instant, and both so. - 
subject to interchange (witness the sudden down- 
fall of the greatest princes, and the speedy up- 
rising of the meanest persons), as the one hath 
nothing so certain whereof to boast, nor the other 
so uncertain whereof to bewail itself. 
For there is no man so assured of his honor, of 
his riches, health, or life but that he may be 
deprived of either, or all, the very next hour 
or day to come. Quid vesper vehat, incertum est ;-

    And yet ye can not tell, saith St. James, what shall 
be. to-morrow. To-day he is set up, and to- 
orrow. he shall not be found, for he is turned 
to ‘dust, and his purpose perisheth. And altho 
the, aix which compasseth adversity. be very 
: obscure, yet therein we better discern God than 
in that shining light which environeth worldly 
‘ glory; through which, for the clearness thereof, 
there is no vanity which eseapeth our sight. And 
let adversity seem what it will—to happy men, 
Yidieulous, who make themselves merry at other 
men’s misfortunes; and to those under the cross, 
grievous—yet this is true, that for all that is 
past, to the very instant, the portions remaining 
are equal to either. For, be it that we have lived 
‘ many years (according to Solomon), ‘‘and in 
them all we have rejoiced’’; or be it that we 
have measured the same length of days, and 
‘therein. have evermore sorrowed; yet, looking 
back from our present being, we find both the 
one and the other—to wit, the joy and the wo— 
sailed out of sight; and death, which doth pursue 
us and hold.us in chase from our infancy, hath 
gathered it. Quicguid etatis retro est, mors tenet; 
whatsoever of our age is past, death holds it. 
So as, whosoever he be to whom fortune hath 
been a servant, and the time a friend, let him 
but take the account of bis memory (for we have 
no other keeper of our pleasures past), and truly 
éxamine what it hath reserved, either of beauty 
and youth, or foregone delights; what it hath 
saved, that it might last, of his dearest affections, 
or of whatever else the amorous springtime gave 
his thoughts of contentment,.then invaluable, 
and he shall find that all the art which his elder

  years have can draw no other vapor out of these 
dissolutions than heavy, secret, and sad. sighs. 
He shall find nothing remaining but those sor- 
rows which grow up after our fast-springing 
youth, overtake it when it is at a stand, and 
overtop it utterly when it begins to wither; in- 
somuch as, looking back from the very instant 
time, and from our now being, the poor, diseased, 
and eaptive creature hath as little sense of all 
his former miseries and. pains as he that is most 
blest, in common opinion, hath of his forepast 
pleasures and delights. For whatsoever is cast 
behind us is just nothing; and what is to come, 
deceitful hope hath it. Omnie que eventura sunt 
in incerto jacent. Only those few black swaus 
I must except who, having had the grace to value 
worldly.vanities af no more than their own price, 
do, by retaining the comfortable memory of a 
well-acted life, behold death without dread, and 
the grave without fear, and embrace both as 
necessary guides to endless glory. . s . | 
If we seek a reason of the succession and con- 
tinuance of bouridless ambition in mortal men, 
we may add, that the kings and princes of the 
world have always laid before them the actions, 
but not the ends of those great ones whieh. pre- 
ceded them. They are always transported with 
the glory. of the one, but they never’ mind the 
misery of the other, till they find the experience 
in themselves. They neglect the advice of God 
while they enjoy life, or hope it, but: they follow 
the counsel of death upon his first approach. 
It is he that puts into man all the wisdom of - 
the world without speaking a word, which God, 
with all the words of His law, promises, or

and. destroyeth man, is believed; God, which hath 
made’ him and loves him, is always deferred. 
: ave considered,’’ saith Solomon, ‘‘all the 
orks that are under the sun, and, behold, all 
vanity and vexation of spirit’’; but who be- 
Tieves it, till death tells it us? It was death, 
which, opening the conscience of Charles V. made 
him enjoin his son Philip to restore Navarre, and 
.. King Francis I. of France to command that jus- 
_ tice should be done upon the murderers of the 
Protestants in Merindol and Cabrieres, which till 
then he neglected. 
It. is therefore death alone that ean suddenly 
make man to know himself. He tells the proud 
and'insolent that they are but abjects, and hum- 
, bles them’ at the instant, makes them ery, com- 
‘plain, ‘and repent, ‘yea, even to hate their fore- 
passed happiness. He takes the account of the 
‘< gich, and proves him a beggar, a naked beggar, 
which hath interest in nothing but in the gravel 
‘that fills his mouth. He holds a glass before 
the eyes of the most beautiful, and makes them

they acknowledge it.

OF TRAVEL* 
Travet, in the younger sort, is a part of educa. — 
tion, in the elder, a part of experience. He that 
traveleth into a country before he ‘hath somé™ 
entrance into the language, goeth to school, and 
not to travel. That. young men travel.-under 
some tutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so 
that he be such a one that hath the language, 
and hath been in the country before; ‘whereby. 
he may be able to tell them what things are 
worthy to be seen in the country where they go}: 
what acquaintances they are to seek; what ex-. 
ercises or discipline the place yieldeth. For else. 
young men shall go hooded, and. look abroad 
little. It is a strange thing, that in sea voyages, 
where there is nothing to be seen but.sky and 
sea, men should make diaries; but in land-travel, 
wherein so much is to be observed, for, the most 
part they omit it; as if chance were. fitter to be:

   red’ than observation. Let diaries there- 
6 brought in use. The things to be seen 
sérved are: the courts of princes, specially 
they. give audience to ambassadors; the 
, of justice, while they'sit and hear causes; 
‘and. so of consistories eeclesiastic; the churches 
and monasteries, with the monuments which are 
therein’ extant; the walls and fortifications of 
cities and towns, and so the havens and harbors; 
antiquities and ruins; libraries, colleges, disputa- 
tions, and lectures, where any are; shipping and 
navies; houses and gardens of state and pleasure, 
near great cities; armories; arsenals; magazines; 
exchanges; burses; warehouses; exercises of 
horsemanship, fencing, training of soldiers, and 
the like; comedies, such whereunto the better 
__. sort-of persons de resort; treasuries of jewels and 
«robes; cabinets and rarities; and, to conclude, 
whatsoever, is memorable in the places where 
they go. After all which the tutors or servants 
‘ought to make diligent study. As for triumphs, 
masks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital execu- 
tions, and such shows, men need not to be put 
in mind of them; yet are they not to be neglected. 
If you will have a young man to put his travel 
into a little room, and in short. time to gather 
much, this you must do. First, as was said, he 
must have some entrance into the language be- 
: fore he goeth. Then he must have such a servant 
or tutor.as knoweth the country, as was likewise 
said. Let him earry with him also some card or 
book deseribing the country where he traveleth; 
which willbe a good key to his inquiry. Let 
him keep also a diary. Let him not stay long 
in’one city or town; more or less as the place 
54   ort 
fore:

  deserveth, but not long; nay, when he stayeth 
in one city or town, let him change his lodging 
from one end ‘and part of the town to another; 
which is a great. adamant of.acquaintance. Let 
him sequester himself from the company of his 
countrymen, and diet in such places where there 
is good company of the nation where he trav- 
eleth. Let him, upon his removes from one place 
to another, procure recommendation to some per- 
son of quality residing in the place whither he 
removeth; that he may use his favor in those 
things he desireth to see or know.. Thus he may 
abridge his travel with much profit. 
As for the acquaintance which is to be sought in 
travel; that which is most of all profitable is 
acquaintance with the secretaries and employed 
men of ambassadors: for so in traveling in one 
country he shall suck the experience of many. 
Let him also see and visit eminent persons in 
all kinds, which are of great name abroad; that 
he may be able to tell how the life agreeth with 
the fame. For quarrels, they are with care and 
diseretion to be avoided. They are commonly. 
for mistresses, healths, place, and words. . And 
let a man beware how he keepeth company with 
cholerie and quarrelsome persons; for they will ~ 
engage him into their own quarrels. When a 
traveler returneth home, let him not. leave the 
countries where he hath traveled altogether be-_. 
hind him; but maintain a correspondence by let- 
ters with those of his acquaintance which are of 
most worth. And let his travel appear rather in.. 
his discourse than in his apparel ‘or. gesture; and 
in his discourse let him be rather adviséd in his’ « 
answers, than forwards to tell steries; and let’

OF RICHES‘ 
“I cannor eall riches better than the baggage 
of virtue. The Roman word is better, impedi- 
menta. For as the baggage is to an army, so is 
riches to virtue. It cannot be spared nor left 
behind, but it hindereth the march; yea, and the 
eare of it sometimes loseth or disturbeth the 
vietory. Of great riches there is: no real use, 
except it be in the distribution; the rest is but 
conceit. So saith Solomon, ‘‘Where much is, 
there’ are many to consume it; and what hath 
the owner but the sight of it with his eyes?’’ 
The personal fruition in any man eannot reach 
to feel great riches; there is a custody of them; 
or a power of dole and donative of them; or a 
.fame of them; but no solid use to the owner. 
Do you not see what feigned prices are set upon 
little stones and rarities? and what works of 
ostentation are undertaken, because there might 
Seem to be some use of great riches? But then 
you will say, they may be of use to buy men 
out of dangers or troubles. As Solomon saith, 
‘Riches are as a stronghold, in the imagination 
of the rich man.’’ 
‘Bat this is excellently exprest, that it is in 
imagination, and not always in fact. For cer- 
56
-P-A-G-E-66
FRANCIS BACON — 
    tainly great riches have sold more men than they 
have bought out. Seek not proud riches, but 
such as thou mayest get justly, use soberly, dis- 
tribute cheerfully, and leave contentedly. Yet 
have no abstract or friarly contempt of them. 
But distinguish as Cicero saith ‘well of Rabirius 
Posthumus, In studio rei amplificande apparebat, 
non avaritie predam, sed instrumentum bonitart 
queri? Harken also to Solomon, and beware of 
hasty gathering of riches: Qui festinat ad divitias, 
non erit insons.* The poets feign, that when 
Plutus (which is Riches) is sent from Jupiter, 
he limps and goes slowly; but when he is sent 
from Pluto, he runs and is swift of foot. Meaning 
that riches gotten by good means and just. labor‘ 
pace slowly; but when they come by the death of 
others (as by the course of inheritance,. testa- 
ments, and the like), they come tumbling upon 
a man. But it might be applied likewise to 
Pluto, taking him for the devil. For when riches 
eome from the devil (as by frand and oppression 
and unjust means), they come upon speed. 
The ways to enrich are many, and most of’ 
them foul. Parsimony is one of the best, and 
yet is not innocent; for it withholdeth men from 
works of liberality and charity. The improve- 
ment of the ground is the most natural obtaining 
of riches; for it is our great mother’s blessing, - 
the earth’s; but it is slow. And yet where men 
of great wealth do stoop to husbandry, it multi- 0 
1 Cicero’s meaning is that Rabirius was not. prompted by 
avarice so much as by a desire to obtain the. means whereby 
he could do good. +

haste to become rich shall not remain innocent.” .

y.time; a great. grazier, a great sheep- 
great timber man, a great collier, a 
“geeateorn-master, a great lead-man, and so of 
iron, and a number of the like points of hus- 
dry. So as the earth seemed a sea to him, 
‘n respect of the perpetual importation. It was 
‘truly observed ‘by one, that himself came very 
, hardly to a little riches, and very easily to great 
yiches. For when'a man’s stock is come ‘to that,

inerease mainly. : N 
The gains of ordinary’ trades and vocations 
are honest; and furthered by two things chiefly:

fair dealing. But the gains of bargains are of 
more. doubtful: nature; when men shall wait 
“upon others’ necessity, broke by servants and 
instruments to draw them on, put off others eun- 
ningly that would be better chapmen, and the like 
practises, which are crafty and naught. As for 
the chopping. of bargains, when a man buys not 
to hold but to sell over again, that commonly 
grindeth double, both upon the seller and upon 
the buyer. Sharings do greatly enrich, if the 
hands be. well chosen. that are trusted. Usury 
is the certainest meavs of gain, tho one of 
the worst; as that whereby a man doth eat his 
bread in sudore vultus alieni;* and besides, doth

  plough upon Sundays. But yet: certain tho it 
be, it hath flaws; for that the seriveners and 
brokers do value unsound men. to.serve their 
own turn. The fortune in. being the first in 
an invention or in a privilege doth cause some- 
times a wonderful overgrowth in riches; as it was 
with the first sugar man in the Canaries.’ There- 
fore if a man can play the true logician, to have 
as well judgment as invention, he may do great . 
matters; especially if the times be fit. : 
He that resteth upon gains certain shall hardly 
grow to great riches; and he that puts all upon 
adventures doth oftentimes break and come: to. 
poverty: it is good therefore to guard adven- 
tures with certainties, that may uphold losses. 
Monopolies, and co-emption of wares for re-sale,’ 
where they are not restrained, are great means to 
enrich; especially if the party have intelligence 
what things are like to come into request, and 
so store himself beforehand. Riches: gotten by 
service, tho it be of the best rise, yet. when they 
are gotten by flattery, feeding humors, and other 
servile conditions, they may be placed amongst 
the worst. As for fishing for testaments and 
executorships (as Tacitus saith of Senéca, testa- 
menta et orbos tamquam indagine capi,*) it is yet 
worse; by how much men submit themselves 
to meaner. persons than in service. Believe: not 
much them that seem to despise niches; for they

OF YOUTH AND AGE 
_A Maw that is young in years may be old in 
hours, if he have lost no time. But that hap- 
‘peneth rarely. Generally, youth is like the first 
cogitations, not so wise as the second. For there 
- is.a@- youth in thoughts, as well as in ages. And 
yet the invention of. young men is more lively 
than that of old; and imaginations stream into 
their minds better, and as it were more divinely. 
Natures that have much heat and great and 
690
-P-A-G-E-70
  FRANCIS BACON 
  violent desires and perturbations are not ripe for 
action till they have passed the meridian of their 
years; as it was with Julius Cesar and Septimius 
Severus. Of the latter of whom it is said, Juven- 
tutem egit erroribus, imo furoribus, plenam’. And 
yet he was the ablest emperor, almost, of all the 
list. But reposed natures may do well in youth. 
As it is seen in Augustus Cesar, Cosmus Duke 
of Florenee, Gaston de Foix, and others. On the 
other side, heat and vivacity. in age is an ex- 
cellent composition for business. 
Young men are fitter to invent than to judge; 
fitter for execution than for counsel; and fitter 
for new projects than for settled business. For 
the experience of age, in things that. fall within 
the compass of it, directeth them; but in new 
things, abuseth them. The errors of young men 
are the ruin of business; but the errors of aged 
men amount but to this, that more might have 
been done, or sooner. Young men, in the con-_ 
duct and managé of actions, embrace more than 
they can hold; stir more than they ean quiet; 
fly to the end, without consideration of the means 
and degrees; pursue some few principles which 
they have chanced upon absurdly; care not to 
innovate, which draws unknown inconveniences ; 
use extreme remedies at first; and that which 
doubleth all errors will not acknowledge or re- 
tract them; like an unready horse, that will nei- 
ther stop nor turn. Men of age object too much, 
consult too long, adventure too little, repent too ~ 
soon, and seldom drive business home to the full. 
She meaning is that Severus passed his youth, not only 
in errors, but that his youth was so full of them aa to. have 
been almost one of madness.

  ‘it is good to compound employments 
for that will be good for the present,

“of. both; and good for succession, that 
yang. men’ may. be learners, while men in age 
, actors; and, lastly, good ‘for extern accidents, 
ause authority followeth old men, and favor 
“dnd popularity youth. But for the moral part, 
| perhaps ‘youth will have the preeminence, as age 
hath for the politic. A certain rabbin, upon the 
text, Your young men shall see visions, and your 
‘old men shall dream dreams, inferreth that young 
men are admitted nearer to God than old, because 
vision isa clearer revelation than a dream. And 
certainly, the more a man drinketh of the world, 
the more it intoxicateth; and age doth profit 
“rather in the powers of understanding, than in 
the virtues of the will and affections. There be 
some have ‘an over-early ripeness in their years, 
which fadeth betimes. These are, first, such as 
have brittle wits, the edge whereof is soon 
turned; such as was Hermogenes” the rhetorician, 
whose books are exceeding subtle; who. after- 
wards waxed stupid. : : 
A second sort is of those that have some nat- 
-aral dispositions which find better grace in 
youth than in age; such as is a fluent and Tuxu- 
, tiant speech; which becomes youth well, but not

OF REVENGE. : 
Rauvencs is a kind of wild justice; which the 
more man’s nature runs to, the more ought law 
to weed it out. For as for the first wrong, it 
doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that 
wrong putteth the law out of office. Certainly, in | 
taking revenge, a man is but even with his en- 
emy; but in passing it over, he is superior; for 
it is a prince’s part to pardon. And Solomon, 
I am sure, saith, Ié is the glory of a man to pass 
by an offense. That which is past is gone, and 
irrevocable; and wise men have enough to do 
with things present and to eome; therefore they 
do but trifle with themselves, that labor in past’ 
matters. There is no man doth a wrong for the 
wrong’s sake; but thereby to purchase himself 
profit, or pleasure, or honor, or the like. There- 
fore why should I be angry with a man for loving 
himself better than me? And if any man should 
do wrong merely out of ill-nature, why, yet’ it 
is but like the thorn or brier, which prick and 
scratch, because they can do no other.,, 
® Livy’s remark means that Seipio'in old age wa a not equal - 
to himself in his youth in the things he performed. 
63 
   
-P-A-G-E-73
  "THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
       
  “Th i: tolerable sort of revenge is for those 
wronga which there is no law to remedy; but 
then: tet 'a man take heed the revenge be such 
as there is no law to punish; else’a man’s enemy 
is still beforehand, and it is two for one. Some, 
-\Wwhen they take revenge, are desirous the party 
should know whence it cometh. This is the more 
generous. For the delight seemeth to be not so J 
  ’---yaueh in doing the hurt, as in making the party 
repent. But base and crafty cowards are like the 
arrow that flieth in the dark. Cosmus,” Duke of 
Florence, had a desperate saying against ‘per- 
fidious or, neglecting friends, as if those wrongs 
were unpardonable: You shail read (saith he) 
that we. are commanded to forgive our enemies; 
but you never, read that we are commanded_to 
- forgive: our. friends, But yet the spirit of Job 
: Was ina, better tune: Shall we (saith he) take 
good dt God’s hands, and not be content to take 
“eo also? vAnd. s0 ‘of friends in a proportion. 
This is certain, that a man that studieth revenge 
keeps his own ‘wounds green, which otherwise 
would heal and do well. Public revenges are for 
the. most part fortunate; as that for the death 
of Cxsar; for the death of Pertinax;" for the 
death of Henry the. Third of France; ” and 
many more. But in private revenges it is not so. 
Nay rather, vindictive persons live the life of 
witches; who, as they are mischievous, so end 
. they infortunate. .

He that hath wife and children hath given 
hostages to fortune; for they are impediments 
to great enterprises, either of virtue or. mischief. 
Certainly the best works, and of greatest merit 
for the public, have proceeded from the. unmar-, 
vied or childless men; which both in affection 
and means have married and endowed the public. 
Yet it were great reason that those that have 
children should have greatest care of future 
times; unto which they know they must transmit 
their dearest pledges. Some there are,’ who tho 
they lead a single life, yet their thoughts do 
end with themselves, and account future times 
impertinences. Nay, there are some other that 
account wife and children but as bills of charges. 
Nay more, there are some foolish rich covetous 
men, that take a pride in having no children, 
because they may be thought so much the richer. 
For perhaps they have heard some talk, Such 
an one is a great rich man, and another except 
to it, Yea, but he hath a great charge of children} 
as if it were an abatement to his riches. : 
But the most ordinary eause of a single life 
is liberty, especially in certain self-pleasing and 
humorous minds, which are so sensible of every 
restraint, as they will go near to. think their 
girdles and garters to be bonds and shackles. 
Unmarried men are best friends, best masters, best, 
servants; but not always best subjects; for they 
are light to run away; and almost all. fugitives

the. ground where it must first fill a pool. It is

they “be facile and corrupt, you shall have a

may be many times more charitable, because their 
means are less exhaust, yet, ‘on the other side, 
they are more eruel and hard-hearted (good to 
make. severe inquisitors), because their tender- 
ness is not so oft. called upon. 
Grave natures, ‘led by custom, and therefore 
constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was 
said: of Ulysses,” vetulam suam pretulit immor-

froward; as presuming upon the merit of their 
chastity:. It is one of the best bonds both of 
chastity and obedience in the wife, if she think 
her’ husband wise; which she will never do if 
she find him jealous. Wives are young men’s 
mistresses; companions for middle-age; and old 
men’s nurses. So as a man may have a quarrel 
to marry when he will. But yet he was reputed 
one of the wise men, that made answer to the

OF ENVY 
Ture be none of the affections which have — 
been noted to fascinate or bewiteh, but love and 
envy. They both have vehement wishes; they 
frame themselves readily into imaginations and 
suggestions; and they come easily into the eye, 
especially upon the presence of the objects; 
which are the points that conduce to fascination, 
if any such thing there be. We see likewise the 
Seripture ealleth envy an evil eye; and the as- 
trologers eall the evil influences of the stars evil 
aspects; so that still there seemeth to be ac- 
knowledged, in the act of envy, an ejaculation 
or irradiation of the eye. Nay some have.been 
so curious as to note that the times when the 
stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most 
hurt are when the party envied is beheld in glory. 
or triumph; for that sets an edge upon ‘envy: 
and besides, at such times the spirits of the per- 
son envied do come forth most into the outward 
parts, and so meet the blow.

But leaving these curiosities (tho not unworthy 
to. be thought. ‘on in fit place), we will handle, 
what “persons are apt to envy others; what per- 
sors are’ most subject to be envied themselves; 
arid what is the difference between public and 
   “oA man. that hath no virtue in himself, ever 
‘envieth virtue in others. For men’s minds will 
either feed upon their own good or upon others’ 
‘evil; and who wanteth the one will prey upon 
the ‘other; 3 and whoso is out of hope to attain to 
another’s virtue, will seek to come at even hand 
by depressing another’s fortune. 
A man that is busy and inquisitive is com- 
monly envious. For to know much of other 
men’s matters cannot be because all that ado 
may concern his own estate; therefore it must 
needs be that he taketh a kind of play- “pleasure 
_ in looking upon the fortunes of others, “Neither 
ean he that mindeth but his own business find 
“-mueh matter for envy.- For envy is a gadding 
passion, and. walketh the streets, and doth not 
keep home: Non est curiosus, quin idem sit male- 
~- wolus, * 
Men of noble birth are noted to be envious 
towards new men when they rise. For the dis- 
» tance is altered; and it is like a deceit of the eye, 
that when others come on they think themselves 
60 back. 
Deformed persons, and eunuchs, and old men, 
and bastards, are envious. For he-that ean not

upon a very brave’ and heroical nature, which 
thinketh to make his natural wants part of his 
honor; in that it should be said, that an eunuch, 
or a lame man, did such great matters; affecting 
the honor of a miracle; as it was in Narses* 
the eunueh, and Agesilaus” and Tamberlanes,” 
that were lame men. : 
The same is the case of men that rise after 
calamities and misfortunes. For they are as men 
fallen out with the times; and think other men’s 
harms a redemption of their own sufferings. 
They that desire to excel in. too many. mat- 
ters, out of levity and vainglory, are ever en-- 
vious. For they can not want work; it being 
impossible but many in some one of those things 
should surpass them. Which was the character 
of Adrian™ the Emperor; that mortally envied 
poets and painters and artifieers, in works where- 
in he had a vein to exeel. 
* Lastly, near kinsfolks, and fellows in. office, 
and those that have been bred together, are more 
apt to envy their equals when they are raised. 
For it doth upbraid unto them their own for- 
tunes, and pointeth at them, and eometh oftener 
into their remembrance, and ineurreth likewise 
more into the note of others; and envy ever 
redoubleth from speech and fame. Cain’s envy

  was'the’ more vile and malignant towards his 
brothér: Abel, because when his sacrifice was 
better accepted there was uo body to look on. 
hus much for those that are apt to envy. 
Concerning those that are more or less subject 
to envy: First, persons of eminent virtue, when 
they are advanced, are less envied. For their 
"fortune seemeth but due unto them; and no man 
envieth the payment of a debt, but rewards and 
liberality rather. Again, envy is ever joined with 
the comparing of a man’s self; and where there 
is no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings 
are not envied but by kings. Nevertheless it is 
to be noted that unworthy persons are most 
-envied at their first. coming in, and afterwards 
overcome it better; whereas contrariwise, persons 
of worth and merit are most envied when their 
fortune eontinueth long. For by that time, tho 
their virtue be the same, yet it hath not the same 
luster; for fresh men grow up that darken it. 
Persons of noble blood are less envied in their 
rising. For it seemeth but right done to their 
birth. Besides, there seemeth not much added 
to their. fortune; and envy is as the sunbeams, 
that beat. hotter upon a bank or steep rising 
ground, than up a flat. And for the same reason 
those that are advanced by degrees are less en- 
. vied than thoge that are advanced suddenly and 
per saltum [at a bound]. 
- Those that have joined with their honor great. 
travels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy. 
For men think that they earn their honors hardly, 
and pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth 
envy. Wherefore you shall observe that. the more 
deep ‘and sober sort of politic persons, in their 
70
-P-A-G-E-80
  FRANCIS BACON 
  greatness, are ever bemoaning themselves, what 
a life they lead; chanting a quanta patimur. Not” 
that they feel it so, but only to abate the edge 
of envy. But this is to be understood of busi- 
ness that is laid upon men, and not such as they 
call unto themselves. For nothing inereaseth 
envy more than an unnecessary and ambitious: 
engrossing of business, And nothing doth ex- 
tinguish envy more than for a great person to 
preserve all other inferior officers in their full 
rights and preeminenees of their places. For by 
that means there be so many sereens between him 
and envy. 
Above all, those are most subject to envy, 
which carry the greatness of their fortunes in 
an insolent and proud manner; being never well 
but while they are showing how great they are, 
either by outward pomp, or by triumphing over 
all opposition or competition; whereas wise men 
will rather do sacrifice to envy, in suffering them- 
selves sometimes of purpose to be crossed and 
overborne in things that do not much concern 
them. Notwithstanding, so much is true, that 
the carriage of greatness in a plain and open 
manner (so it be without arrogancy and vain 
glory) doth draw less envy than if it bein a 
more crafty and cunning fashion. For in that 
eourse a man doth but disavow fortune; and 
seemeth to be conscious of his own want in 
worth; and doth but teach others to envy him. 
Lastly, to conclude this part; as we said-in 
the beginning that the act of envy had somewhat 
in it of witcheraft, so there is no other cure of 
envy but the cure of witcheraft; and that is, 
to remove the Jot (as they call it) and to lay 
71

  it upon another. For which purpose, the wiser 
sort ef great persons bring im .éver upon the 
stage.somebody upon whom. to derive the envy 
that:would come upon themselves;. sometimes 
upon’ ministers and servants; sometimes upon 
-. colleagues and associates; and the like; and for 
that turn there are never wanting some persons 
of violent and undertaking nature, who, so they 
may have power and business, will take it at 
any cost. ° 
Now,.to speak of public envy. There is yet 
‘some good in public envy, whereas in private 
there is none. For public envy is as an ostracism, 
that eclipseth men when they grow too great. 
And therefore it is a bridle also to great ones, 
to keep them within bounds. 
..This envy, being in the Latin word imvidia, 
goeth in the modern languages by the name of 
discontentment; of which we shall speak in han- 
dling sedition. It is a disease in a state like 
to. infection. For as infection spreadeth upon 
:that whieh is sound, and tainteth it; so when 
envy is gotten once into a state, it traduceth 
even the best actions thereof, and turneth them 
into an ill-odor. And therefore there is little 
won by intermingling of plausible actions. For 
that doth argue but a weakness and fear of envy, 
which hurteth so much the more, as it is like- 
.. wise usual in infections; which if you fear them, - you eall them upon you. 
This public envy seemeth to beat chiefly upon 
principal officers or ministers, rather than upon . kings and estates themselves. But this is a sure rule, that if the envy upon the minister be great, when the cause of it in him is small; or if the 
ved
-P-A-G-E-82
  FRANCIS BACON _ 
  envy be general in a manner upon all the min- 
isters of an estate; then the envy (tho hidden) 
is truly upon the state itself. And.so much of 
publie envy or discontentment, and the difference 
thereof from private envy, which. was handled 
in the first place. 
We will add this in general, touching the af- 
fection of envy; that of all other affections it is 
the most importune and continual. ‘For: of. other 
affections there is oceasion given but now and 
then; and therefore it was well said, Invidia 
festos dies non agit:* for it is ever working upon 
some or other. And it is also noted that ‘love 
and envy do make a man pine, which other 
affections do not, because they are not so eon~ © 
tinual. It is also the vilest affection, and the 
most depraved; for which cause it is the proper 
attribute of the devil, who is called the envious 
man, that soweth tares amongst the wheat by 
night; as it always cometh to pass, that envy 
worketh subtilly, and in the dark; and to the 
prejudice of good things, such as is the wheat.

- QF GOODNESS AND GOODNESS OF 
5 NATURE 
I vars goodness in this sense, the affecting of 
the weal of men, which is that.the Grecians call 
philanthropia; and the word humanity (as it is 
used) is a. little too light to express it. Good- 
ness I call the habit, and goodness of nature the 
inclination. This of all virtues and dignities of 
the mind is the greatest; being the character of 
the Deity: and without it man is a busy, mis- 
chievous, wretched thing; no better than a kind 
of vermin. Goodness answers to the theological 
virtue charity, and admits no excess, but error. 
The desire of power in excess caused the angels 
to fall; the desire of knowledge in excess eaused man to fall: but in charity there is no excess} 
neither can angel or man come in danger by it. 
The inclination to goodness is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; insomuch that if it issue 
not towards men, it will take unto other living 
creatures; as it is seen in the Turks, a cruel 
‘people, who nevertheless are kind to beasts, and 
give alms to dogs and birds; insomuch as Bus- 
bechius” reporteth, a Christian boy in. Constan- 
- tinople had like to have been stoned for gagging 
ina. wageishness a long-billed fowl. Errors 
indeed in this virtue of goodness or charity may 
be committed. The Italians have an ungracious

  proverb, Tanto buon che val niente™ And one 
of the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel,” 
had the confidence to put in writing, almost in 
plain terms, That the Christian faith had given up 
good men in prey to those that are tyrannical and 
unjust. Which he spake, because indeed there 
was never law or sect or opinion did so much 
magnify goodness as the Christian religion doth. 
Therefore, to avoid the scandal and the danger 
both, it is good to take knowledge of the errors 
of an habit so excellent. Seek the good of other 
men, but be not in bondage to their faces or 
fancies; for that is but facility or softness; which 
taketh an honest mind prisoner. Neither give 
thou Ausop’s cock a gem, who would be better 
pleased and happier if he had had a barley-corn. 
The example of God teacheth the lesson truly: 
He sendeth his rain and maketh his sun to shine 
upon the just and unjust; but He doth not rain 
wealth, nor shine honor and virtues, upon men 
equally. Common benefits are to be eommunicate 
with all; but peculiar benefits with choice. And 
beware how in making the portraiture thou 
breakest the pattern. For divinity maketh the 
love of ourselves the pattern; the love of our 
neighbors but the portraiture. Sell all thou hast, 
and give it to the poor, and follow me: but sell 
not all thou hast, except thou come and follow 
me; that is, except thou have a vocation wheréin 
thou mayest do as much good with little means 
as with great; for otherwise in feeding the 
streams thou driest the fountain. 
% The meaning is that one may be so good as to be good 
for nothing. 
= Machiavelli, the famous author of “The Prince.”

  Neither is there only a habit of goodness, 
directed by right reason; but there is in some 
men; yen in nature, a disposition towards it; 
_asvon ithe other side there is a natural malignity. 
For there be that in their nature do not affect 
the good of others. The lighter sort of malignity 
turneth but to a ecrossness, or frowardness, or 
aptness to oppose, or difficilness, or the like; 
‘but. the deeper sort to envy and mere mischief. 
Such men in other men’s calamities are, as it 
were, in season, and are ever on the loading 
part: not’so good as the dogs that licked Laza- 
rus’ sores; but like flies that are still buzzing 
upon anything that is raw;. misanthropi [haters 
of men], that make it their practise to bring 
men to the bough, and yet have never a tree 
for the purpose in their gardens, as. Timon ® had. 
Such dispositions are the very errors of human 
nature; and yet they are the fittest timber to 
make great polities of; like to knee timber, that 
‘is good for ships, that are ordained to be tossed; 
- but not for ‘building houses, that shall stand 
firm. The parts and signs of goodness are many. 
Ifa man be gracious and courteous to strangers, 
it shows he is a citizen of the world, and that 
his heart is no island eut off from other lands, 
but a continent that joins to them. If he be 
compassionate towards the afflictions of others, 
it'shows that his heart is like the noble tree 
that.is wounded itself when it gives the balm. 
If he easily pardons and. remits offenses, it shows 
that his mind is planted above injuries; so that 
he eannot be shot. If he be thankful for small

and not their trash. But above all, if he have 
St. Paul’s perfection, that he would wish to be 
an anathema from Christ for the salvation of 
his brethren, it shows much of a divine nature, 
and a kind of conformity with Christ Himself.

OF STUDIES 
Sruvrs serve for delight, for ornament, and 
for ability. Their chief use for delight is in 
privateness and retiring; for ornament.is in dis- 
course; and for ability is in the judgment and 
disposition of business. For expert men can 
execute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one 
by one; but the general counsels, and, the plots 
and marshaling of affairs, come best from those 
that are learned. To spend too much time in 
studies is sloth; to use them too much for orna- 
ment, is affectation; to make judgment wholly 
by their rules, is the humor of a scholar. They 
perfect nature, and are perfected by experience: 
for natural abilities are like natural plants, that 
need proyning,” by study; and studies themselves 
do give forth directions too much at large, except 
they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men 
eontemn studies, simple men admire them, and 
wise men use them; for they teach not their own

use; but that is a wisdom. without them, and 
. above them, won by observation. Read not to 
contradict and confute; nor to believe and take 
for granted; nor to find talk and discourse; but 
to weigh and consider.| Some books are to be 
tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to 
be chewed and digested; that is, some books are 
to be read only in parts; others to be read, but 
not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, 
and with diligence and attention. Some books 
also may be read by deputy, and extracts made 
of them by others; but that would be only in 
the less important arguments, and the meaner 
sort of books; else distilled books are like com- 
mon distilled waters, flashy things. Reading 
maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and 
writing an exact man. 
And therefore, if a man write little, he had 
need have a great memory; if he confer little, 
he had need have a present wit: and if he read 
little, he had need have much cunning, to seem 
to know that he doth not. Histories make men 
wise;'poets witty; the mathematics subtile; nat- 
ural philosophy deep; moral grave; logic and 
rhetorié able to contend. Abeunt studia in mores. 
Nay, there is no stond or impediment in the wit 
but may be wrought out by fit studies; like as 
. diseases of the body may have appropriate ex-~ 
" ereises.. Bowling is good for the stone and reins ; 
shooting for the lungs and breast; gentle walking 
for the stomach; riding for the head; and the 
like. So if a man’s wit be wandering, let him 
study the mathematics; for in .demonstrations,

  if his wit be called away never so little, he must 
begin again. If his wit be not apt to distinguish 
or find differences, let him study the Schoolmen; 
for they are cymini sectorés (splitters of hairs]. 
If he be not apt to beat over matters, and to 
call up one thing to prove and illustrate another, 
let him study the lawyers’ cases. So every. defect 
of the mind may have a special receipt. 
Ix 
OF REGIMENT OF HEALTH 
THERE is a wisdom in this beyond the rules of 
physic: a man’s own observation, what he finds 
good of, and what he finds hurt of, is the best 
physic to preserve health. But it is a safer 
conclusion to say, This agreeth not well with me, 
therefore I will not continue it; than this, I find 
no offense of this, therefore I may use it. For 
strength of nature in youth passeth over many 
excesses, which are owing a man till his age. 
Discern of the coming on of years, and think 
not to do the same things still; for age will not 
be defied. Beware of sudden change in any 
great point of diet, and if necessity inforce it, 
fit the rest to it. For it is a seeret in nature and 
state, that it is safer to change many things 
than one. Examine thy customs of diet, sleep, 
exercise, apparel, and the like; and try, in any 
thing thou shalt judge hurtful, to discontinue 
it by little and little; but so, as if thou dost 
79
-P-A-G-E-89
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
find-any-inconvenience by the change, thou come 
back. to’ it again: for it is hard to distinguish 
’ that which is generally held good and wholesome, 
from that which is good particularly, and fit for 
thine. own body. 
To be free-minded and cheerfully disposed at 
“Hours of meat &nd of sleep and of exercise, is 
one of the best precepts of long lasting. As 
for the passions and studies of the mind; avoid 
envy; anxious fears, anger fretting inwards; 
subtle and knotty inquisitions; joys and exhilara- 
tions in excess; sadness not communicated. En- 
‘tertain hopes; mirth rather than joy; variety 
of delights, rather than surfeit of them; wonder 
and admiration, and therefore novelties; studies 
that fill the mind with splendid and illustrious 
objects, ag histories, fables, and contemplations 
of nature.. If you fly physic in health altogether, 
it will be too strange for your body when you 
“shall need it. If. you make it too familiar, it 
will work no extraordinary effect when sickness 
cometh. I commend rather some diet for certain 
seasons, than frequent use. of physic, except it 
be grown into a custom. For those diets alter 
the body more, and trouble it less. 
Despise no new accident in your body, but ask 
opinion of it. In sickness, respect health prin- 
cipally; and in health, action. For those that 
| put their bodies to endure in health, may in 
most sicknesses, which are not very sharp, be 
eured only with diet and tendering. Celsus” could 
never have spoken it as a physician, had he not 
been a wise man withal, when he giveth it for

-P-A-G-E-90
  FRANCIS BACON 
  
one of the great precepts of health and lasting, 
that a man do vary and interchange contraries, 
but with an inclination to the more benign ex- 
treme: use fasting and full eating, but, rather 
full eating; watching and sleep, but rather sleep; 
sitting and exercise, but rather exercise; and the 
like. So shall nature be cherished,. and~ yet 
taught masteries. Physicians are some of them 
so pleasing and conformable to the humor of the 
patient, as they press not the true cure of the 
disease; and some other are so regular in pro- 
ceeding according to art for the disease, as they 
respect not sufficiently the condition of the pa- 
tient. Take one of a middle temper; or if. it 
may not be found in one man, combine two of 
either sort; and forget not to call as well the 
best acquainted with your body, as the best. 
reputed of for his faculty.

live all freemen? As Casar lov’d me, I weep 
for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; 
as he was valiant, I honor him; but as he was 
ambitious, I slew him, There is tears for his 
love; joy for his fortune; honor for his valor; 
and death for his ambition. Who is here so

OF SHAKESPEARE AND OTHER WITS* 
I rememser the players that have often men- 
tioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, that in 
his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never 
blotted out a line. My answer hath been, ‘‘Would 
he had blotted a thousand,’’ which they thought 
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity 
this, but for their ignorance who chose that 
circumstance to commend their friend by wherein 
he most faulted; and to justify mine own candor, 
for I loved the man, and do honor his memory 
on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, 
indeed, honest, and of an open and free nature; 
had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and 
gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that 
facility, that sometimes it was necessary he 
should be stopt. Sufflaminandus erat, as Au- 
gustus said of Haterius. His wit was in his own 
power: would the rule of it had been so too.

Others that in composition are nothing but

gently, they trouble it of purpose. They would 
not have it run without rubs, as if that style 
were more strong and manly that. struck the 
ear with a kind of unevenness. These men err 
not by ehance, but knowingly and willingly; 
they are like men that affect a fashion by them- 
selves; have some singularity in a ruff, cloak, 
or hatband; or their beards specially eut to pro- 
voke beholders, and set a mark upon themselves. 
They would be reprehended while they are looked 
on. And this vice, one that is authority with 
the rest, loving, delivers over to them to be 
imitated; so that ofttimes the faults which he 
fell into, the others seek for. This is the danger, 
when vice becomes a precedent. 
Others there are that have no composition .at 
all; but a kind of tuning and riming fall in 
what they write. J¢ runs and slides, and only 
makes a sound. Women’s poets they are called, 
as you have women’s tailors. 
‘They write a verse as smooth, as soft as

them with your middle finger. They are eream-

  they presently find or meet, without choice. By 
which means it happens that what they have 
discredited and impugned in‘ one week, they 
. have before or after extolled the same in an- 
other, Such are all the essayists, even their 
master Montaigne. These, in all they write, 
~ eonfess still what books they have read last, and 
therein their own folly so much that they bring 
"46 to the stake raw and undigested; not that the 
    place did need it neither, but that they thought 
themselves furnished and would vent it. . . 
It cannot but come to pass that these men 
who commonly seek to do more than enough may 
sometimes happen on something that is good and 
great; but very seldom: and when it comes it 
doth not recompense the rest of their ill. For 
their jests, and their sentences (which they only 
‘and ambitiously seek for) stick out and are more 
eminent because all is sordid and vile about 
them; as lights are more discerned in a thick 
darkness than a faint shadow. Now, because 
they speak all they can (however unfitly), they 
are thought to have the greater copy; where the 
learned use ever election and a mean, they look 
back to what they intended at first, and make 
all an even and proportioned body. The true 
artificer will not run away from Nature as he 
were afraid of her, or depart from life and the 
likeness of truth, but speak to the capacity of 
his hearers. And tho his language differ from

THE ANTIQUITY OF ANGLING* 
Piscator—O sir, doubt not that angling is an 
art: is it not an art to deceive a trout with an 
"artificial fly? a trout that is more sharp-sighted 
than any hawk you have named, and more watch- 
ful and timorous than your high-mettled merlin is 
bold; and yet I doubt not to cateh a brace or 
two to-morrow for a friend’s breakfast. Doubt 
not, therefore, sir, but that angling is an art, 
and an art worth your learning. The question 
‘is rather, whether you be capable of learning it? 
for angling is somewhat like poetry—men are to 
be. born so: I mean, with inclinations to it, tho 
both may be heightened by discourse and prac- 
tise; but he that hopes: to be a good angler must 
not ‘only bring an inquiring, searching, observing 
wit, but he must bring a large measure of hope 
and patience, and a love and propensity to the

then doubt not but angling will prove to be so 
pleasant that it will prove to be like virtue, a 
reward to itself. : . .

pectation, that I long much to have you. proceed, 
and in the order you propose. | 
Piscator—Then first, for the antiquity of an- 
gling, of which I shail not say much, but only 
this: some say it is as aneient as’ Deucalion’s 
flood? others, that Belus, who was the first in- 
yentor of godly and virtuous recreations, was the 
first inventor ef angling; and some. others say— 
for former times have had their disquisitions 
about the antiquity of it—that Seth, one of the 
sous of Adam, taught it to his sons, and that by’ 
them it was derived to posterity; others say that 
he left it engraven on those pillars which he 
erected, and trusted to preserve. the knowledge 
of the mathematics, musie, and the rest of that 
precious knowledge and those useful arts, which 
by Gods appointment or allowance and his noble: 
industry were thereby preserved from perishing 
in Noah’s flood. ce 
These, sir, have been the opinions of several 
men that have possibly endeavored to make ‘an- 
gling more ancient than is needful, or may ‘well 
be warranted; but for my part, I shall content 
myself in telling you that angling is much more

    ancient, than the Incarnation of our Savior: for 
in the prophet Amos, mention is made of fish- 
hooks; and in the book of Job, which was long 
_ before the days of Amos—for that book is said 
tobe writ by Moses—mention is made also of 
fish-hooks, which must imply anglers in those 
times. 
But, my worthy friend, as I would rather 
prove myself a gentleman by being learned and 
. humble, valiant and inoffensive, virtuous and 
eommunicable, than by any fond ostentation of 
riches;. or, wanting those virtues myself, boast 
that these were in my ancestors (and yet I grant 
that where a noble and ancient descent and such 
merit meet in any man, it is a double dignifica- 
tion of that person) ;—so if this antiquity of 
angling, whieh for my part I have not forced, 
shall, like an ancient family, be either an honor 
or an ornament to this virtuous art which I 
profess to love and practise, I shall be the gladder 
that I made an accidental mention of the an- 
tiquity of it, of which I shall say no more, but 
proceed: to that just commendation which I think 
it deserves. 
And for that, I shall tell you that in ancient 
times 2 debate hath arisen, and it remains yet 
unresolved: whether the happiness of man in this 
‘world doth consist more in contemplation or 
action? 
Concerning which, some have endeavored to 
maintain their opinion of the first, by saying 
that the nearer we mortals come to God by way 
of imitation, the more happy we are. And they 
say that God enjoys himself only by a contempla- 
tion of his own infiniteness, eternity, power, and 
94
-P-A-G-E-100
A

  goodness, and the like. And upon this ground, 
many eloisteral men of great learning and devo- 
tion prefer ‘contemplation before action, And 
many of the fathers seem to approve this opinion, 
as may appear in their commentaries upon the 
words of our Savior to Martha (Luke x : 41, 42). 
And on the contrary, there want not men of 
equal authority and credit, that prefer action 
to be the more excellent; as namely, experiments 
in physic, and the application of it, both for the 
ease and prolongation of man’s life; by which 
each man is enabled to. act and do good to others, 
either to serve his country or do good to par- 
ticular persons. And they say also that action 
is doctrinal, and teaches both art. and. virtue, 
and is a maintainer of human society; and fox. 
these, and other like reasons, to be preferred 
before contemplation. 
Concerning which two opinions, I shall for- 
bear to add @ third by declaring my own; and 
rest myself contented in telling you, my very 
worthy friend, that both these meet together, 
and do most properly belong to the most -honest, 
ingenious, quiet, and harmless art of angling. 
And first I shall tell you what some have ob- 
served, and I have found it to be a real truth— 
that the very sitting by the river’s side is. not 
only the quietest and fittest place for contempla- 
tion, but will invite an angler to it; and this 
seems to be maintained by the learned Peter Du 
Moulin, who in his discourse on the fulfilling 
of prophecies, observes that when God intended 
to reveal any future events or high notions to 
His prophets, He then carried them either to the 
deserts or the sea-shore, that having so separated

Bag 
OF THE TROUT‘ 
Tux trout is a fish highly valued both in this 
and foreign nations; he may be. justly said, as 
the old poet said of wine, and we English say 
of venison, to be a generous fish: a fish that is so 
like the buck that he also has his seasons; for 
it is observed, that he comes in and goes out 
of season with the stag and buck. Gesner says 
his name is of German offspring, and says he is 
a fish that feeds clean and purely, in the swiftest. 
streams, and on the hardest gravel; and that he 
may justly contend with all fresh-water fish, as 
the mullet may with all sea-fish, for precedency 
and daintiness of taste, and that being in right 
season, the most dainty palates have allowed pre- 
cedency to him. 
And before I go further in my discourse, let 
me tell you, that you are to observe, that as there 
be some barren does that are good in summer, 
so there be some barren trouts that are good 
in winter; but there are not many that are 
. so, for usually they be in their perfection in 
the month of May, and decline with the buck. 
Now you are to take notice, that in several coun-

tries, as in Germany and in other parts, com- 
pared to ours, fish differ much in*their bigness. 
and shape, and other ways, and so do trouts: 
It is well known that in Lake Leman, the lake. 
of Geneva, there are trouts taken of three eubits- 
long, as is affirmed by Gesner, a writer of good 
eredit; and Mercator says, the trouts that are. 
taken in the lake of Geneva are a-great part 
of the merchandise of that famous city. And you 
are further to know, that there be certain waters, 
that breed trouts remarkable both for their num- 
ber and smallness. I know a little brook in 
Kent that breeds them to a number incredible, 
and you may take them twenty or forty in an 
hour, but none greater than about the size of a. 
gudgeon: there are also in divers rivers, espe-- 
cially that relate to or be near to the sea, as 
Winchester, or the Thames about Windsor, a ~ 
little trout called samlet, or skegger trout (in 
both which places I have caught twenty or forty 
at a standing), that will bite as fast and as freely - 
as minnows; these be by some taken to be young’ 
salmon; but in those waters they never grow to: 
be bigger than a herring. : 
There is also in Kent, near: to Canterbury, a 
trout ealled there a Fordidge trout, a trout that 
bears the name of the town where it is usually 
caught, that is accounted the rarest of fish; many 
of them near the bigness of a salmon, but known 
by their different color; and in their best. season. 
they eut very white; and none of these have 
been known to be caught with an angle, unless 
it were one that was caught by Sir George Has- 
tings, an excellent angler, and now with God: 
and he hath told me, he thought that trout bit ,

not-for ‘hunger but wantonness; and it is rather 
'to,be ‘believed, because both he, then, and many 
others before him, have been curious to search 
_ nto their bellies, what the food was by which 
_ “they lived, and have found out nothing by which 
they might satisfy their curiosity. 
‘ Goneerning which you are to take notice, that 
it is reported by good. authors, that grasshoppers, 
“and some fish, have no mouths, but are nourished 
and take breath by the porousness of their gills, 
man knows not how: and this may be believed, if 
we consider. that when the raven hath hatched 
her eggs, she takes no further care, but leaves 
her young ones to the care of the God of nature, 
. Who is said, in’ the Psalms, ‘‘to feed the young 
ravens that call upon Him.’’ And they be kept 
- alive and fed by dew, or worms that breed in 
their nests, or some other ways that. we mortals 
know. not; and this may be believed of the For- ' didgé trovt, which, as it is said of the stork 
(Jerem. viii.: 7), that ‘‘he knows his season,’’ 
so he knows his times, I think salmost his day 
of coming into the river out of the sea, where 
he lives, and, it is like, feeds nine months of 
the year, and fasts three in the river of For- 
didge. And you are to note that those townsmen 
. are very punetual in observing the time of be- 
ginning to fish for them, and boast much that their 
river affords a trout that exceeds all others. And 
just so does Sussex boast of several fish; as 
namely, a Shelsey cockle, a Chichester lobster, 
an Arundel mullet, and an Amerly trout. 
And now for some confirmation of the For- 
didge trout: you are to know that this trout is 
thought to eat nothing in the fresh water; and 
98

Jeon are said to live, by the sun and the air. 
There is also in Northumberland a trout called 
a bull trout, of a much greater length and big- 
ness than any in the southern parts. And there 
are, in many rivers that relate to the sea, salmon 
trouts, as much different from others, both in 
shape and in their spots, as we see sheep in 
some countries differ one from another in their 
shape and bigness, and in the fineness of their 
wool. And certainly, as some pastures breed 
larger sheep, so do some ‘rivers, by reason of the 
ground over which they run, breed larger trouts. 
Now the next thing that I will-commend to

  ‘THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  your’ consideration is, that the ‘trout is of a 
more sudden growth than other fish. Concerning 
which, you are also to take notiee, that he lives 
not so long as the perch and divers other fishes 
do, as Sir Francis Bacon hath observed in his 
ill ilhistory of Life and Death. a8 that b. ' 
you are to take notice, that he is no

_aaderit'fit for generation. And you are to note, 
that he continues many months out of season; 
for it may be observed of the trout, that he is 
like the buck or the ox, that he will not be fat 
in many months, tho he go in the very same 
' pasture that horses do, which will be fat in one 
month; and so you may observe, that most other 
. fishes recover strength, and grow sooner far and 
in season, than the trout doth. 
And next you are to note, that till the sun gets 
to such a height as to warm. the earth and the 
water, the trout is sick and lean, and lousy, 
and unwholesome; for you shall in winter find 
him to have a big head, and then to be lank, 
and thin, and lean; at which time many of them

  have sticking on them sugs, or trout-lice, which 
is a kind of worm, in shape-like.a clove or pin, 
with a big head, and sticks close to him and 
sucks his moisture; those I think the trout breeds 
himself, and never thrives till he frees himself 
from them, which is when warm weather comes; 
and then, as he grows stronger, he gets from the 
dead, still water, inte the sharp streams, and 
the gravel, and there tubs off these worms or 
lice; and then as he grows stronger, so he gets 
him into swifter and swifter streams, and there 
lies at the watch for any fly or minnow: that 
comes near to him; and he especially loves the 
May-fly, which is bred of the eod-worm or ead- 
dis; and these make the trout bold and lusty, 
and he is usually fatter and better meat at the 
end of that month (May) than at any time of 
the year. .

to present to my merciful God but sin and mis- 
ery; but the first is pardoned, and a. few hours 
will now put a period to the latter; for I shall

and his many acts of mercy. ‘To which he made

‘After: this discourse he became more restless, 
é and his soul seemed to be weary of her earthly 
tabernacle; and this uneasiness became so visible, 
that his wife, his three nieces, and Mr. Woodnot, 
“stood constantly about his bed, beholding him 
“with sorrow, and an unwillingness to lose the 
_vsight of him, whom they could not hope to see 
-much longer. As they stood thus beholding him, 
his wife observed him breathe faintly, and with 
mueh trouble, and observed him to fall into a 
sudden agony; whieh so surprized her, that she 
fell into a sudden passion, and required of him 
+o know how he did. To which his answer was, 
“that he had passed a conflict with his last en- 
emy, and had overcome him by the merits of 
his Master Jesus.’ After which answer, he 
looked up, and saw his wife and nieces weeping 
to an extremity, and charged them, if they loved 
him to withdraw into the next room, and there 
pray every one alone for him; for nothing but 
their lamentations could make his death un- 
comfortable. ‘To which request their sighs and 
tears. would. not suffer them to make any reply; 
but they yielded him a sad. obedience, leaving 
only with him Mr. Woodnot and Mr. Bostock.

to Mr. Bostock, ‘‘Pray, Sir, open that door, then 
. look into that ‘cabinet, in which you may easily 
» find my last will, and give it into my hand’’; 
“) whieh being done, Mr. Herbert delivered it into 
the hand of Mr. Woodnot, and said, ‘‘My old

I know you will be so for your own sake; but I 
charge you, by the religion of our friendship, 
to be eareful of them.’’ And having obtained 
Mr. Woodnot’s promise to be so, he said, ‘I am 
now ready to die.” After which words, he said, 
*‘Lord, forsake me not now my strength faileth 
me: but grant me merey for the merits of my 
Jesus. And now, Lord—Lord, now receive my 
soul.’?? And with those words he breathed forth 
his divine soul, without any apparent disturbance, 
Mr. Woodnot and Mr. Bostock attending his last

Against him this city hath performed notable 
exploits, and not only against him, but divers

galleys often preserved St. Peter’s bark from 
sinking: for which, by way of reward, one of

perpetual flux, and a kind of succession of decays, 
and consequently requiring, ever and anon, a

that have internal principles of heat, useth to: . 
transpire, breathe out, and waste away, through «~ 
invisible pores, by exercise, motion, and sleep,

in: his manhood, or the same in his manhood that 
he'had in his youth, the same in his youth that 
he carried about with him in his childhood, or 
the same in his childhood which he wore first in 
“the womb. I make a doubt whether I had the 
“game identical, individually numerical body, when 
T earried-a calf-leather satchel to school in Here- 
ford, as when I wore a lambskin hood in Oxford; 
or whether I have the same mass of blood in 
my veins, and the same flesh, now in Venice, 
which I carried about me three years since, up 
‘and down London streets, having, in lieu of beer 
and ale, drunk wine all this while, and fed upon 
different viands. Now, the stomach is like a 
erneible, for it hath a chemical kind of virtue to 
' transmute one body into another, to transsub- 
  stantiate fish and fruits into. flesh within and 
about us; but tho it be questionable whether I 
wear the same flesh which is fluxible, I am sure 
my hair is not the same, for you. may remember 
I went flaxen-haired out of England, but yeu

here than anywhere. 
‘1 But whereas I expected to have found Rome 
‘elevated. upon seven hills, I meet her rather 
spreading npon a flat, having humbled herself, 
since she was made a Christian, and descended 
from those hills to Campus Martius; with Tras- 
tevere and the suburbs of Saint Peter, she hath

-far short of that vast cireuit she had in Claudius

fifty miles’ circumference, and she had five hun-

‘that was made, which, allowing but six to every 
‘family ‘in women, children, and servants, came 
‘to three millions of souls; but she is now a 
wilderness in comparison of that number. 
The pope is grown to be a great temporal 
prince of late years, for the state of the church 
extends above three hundred miles in length, 
and two hundred miles in breadth; it contains 
Ferrara, Bologna, Romagnia, the Marquisate of 
. ‘Ancona, Umbria, Sabina, Perugia, with a part 
of Tuscany, the patrimony, Rome herself, and 
‘Latium. In these there are above fifty bishop- 
ries; the pope hath also the duchy of Spoleto, 
‘and the.exarchate of Ravenna; he hath the town 
“of Benevento in the kingdom of Naples, and the

country of Venissa, called Avignon, in France. 
He hath title also good enough to Naples itself; 
but, rather than offend his champion, the king 
of Spain, he is contented with a’ white mule, and 
purse of pistoles about the neck, which he re- 
ceives every year for a heriot or homage, or 
what you will call it; he pretends also to be 
Lord-paramount of Sicily, Urbia, Parma, and 
Masseran; of Norway, Ireland, and England,

dulfo his legate’s feet. : ‘ 
The state of the apostolic see here in Italy 
lieth *twixt two seas, the Adriatic and the Tyr- — 
rhene, and it runs through the midst of Italy, 
which makes the pope powerful to. do good or 
harm, and more capable than any other to be © 
an umpire or an enemy. His. authority being’ 
mixed ‘*twixt temporal and spiritual, disperseth _ 
itself into so many members, that a young man 
may grow old here before he can well under- 
stand the form of government. 
The consistory of cardinals meet but once a 
week, and once a week they solemnly wait all 
upon the pope. I am told there are now in 
Christendom but sixty-eight cardinals, whereof 
there are six eardinal bishops, fifty-one cardinal 
priests, and eleven cardinal deacons. The car- 
dinal bishops attend and sit near the pope, when 
he eelebrates any festival; the cardinal priests 
assist him at mass; and the cardinal deacons 
attire him. A cardinal is bade by a short breve

(who had deposed him) by consenting to hold his kingdom

te sociwm regibus, superiorem ducibus, et fratrem

tioned for. any offense, there must be twenty-four 
witnesses produced against him. The Bishop of 
Ostia hath most privilege of any other, for he 
éonsecrates and installs the pope, and goes al- 
ways next to him. All these cardinals have the 
‘Yepute of princes, and -besides other: incomes, 
they have the annats of benefices to support their 
greatness. 
--For point of power, the pope is able to put 
50,000 men in the field, in case of necessity, 
besides his naval strength in galleys. We read 
how Paul III sent Charles III twelve thousand 
foot and five hundred horse. Pius V sent a 
_gteater aid to Charles IX; and for riches, be- 
sides the temporal dominions he hath in all the 
countries before named, the datany or dispatch- 
ing of bulls, the triennial subsidies, annats, and 
other ecclesiastical rights, mount to an unknown 
sum; .and it is a common saying here, that as 
Jong as the pope can finger a pen, he can want 
no pence. Pins V, notwithstanding his expenses 
in buildings, left four millions in the Castle of 
Saint Angelo in less than five years; more, I 
believe, than this Gregory XV will, for he hath 
many nephews; and better is it to be the pope’s 
nephew, ‘than: to be a favorite to any prince in 
‘Christendom. oe

Darkness and light divide the course of time,

our felicities, and the smartest strokes of afflic- 
tion leave but short smart upon us. Sense en- 
dureth no extremities, and sorrows destroy us or 
themselves. To weep into stones are fables. 
Afflietions induce callosities; miseries are slip- 
pery, or fall like snow upon us, which notwith- 
standing is no unhappy stupidity. To be ig- 
norant of evils t¢ come, and forgetful of evils 
_ past, is a merciful provision in nature, whereby

than be lost in the uncomfortable night of noth-

being, and make one particle of the publie soul all 
things, which was no more than to return into 
their unknown and divine original again. ‘Egyp- 
tian ingenuity was more unsatisfied, contriving 
their bodies in sweet consistencies, to attend the 
return of their souls, But all was vanity, feeding

In vain do individuals hope for immortality,

conceits to perpetuate their names in heaven. 
The various cosmography of that part hath al-

Nimrod is lost in Orion, and Osiris in the Dog-

Enoch and Elias, without either tomb or burial, 
in an anomalous state of being, are the great

memory, in strict account being still on this 
side death, and having a late part yet to act 
upon this stage of earth. If in the deeretory

changed, according to received translation, the 
last day will make but few graves; at least 
quick resurrections will anticipate lasting sepul- 
tures. Some graves will be opened before they 
pe quite closed, and Lazarus be no wonder. When 
many that feared to die, shall groan that they 
can die but once, the dismal state is the second 
and living death, when life puts despair on the 
damned; when men shall wish the coverings of. 
mountains, not of monuments, and annihilations 
shall be courted.

Aver I had, from my first years, by the cease- 
less diligence and eare of my father (whom God 
recompense!), been exercised to the tongues, and 
some sciences, as my age would suffer, by sundry 
masters and teachers, both at home and at the

or betaken to of my own choice in English, or 
other tongue, prosing or versing, but chiefly the 
latter, the style, by certain vital signs it had, was 
likely to live. But much latelier, in the private 
academies of Italy, whither I was favored to 
resort, pereeiving that some trifles which I had. 
in memory, composed at under twenty or there- 
about—for the manner is, that every one must 
give some proof of his wit and reading there— 
met with acceptance above what was looked for; 
and other things which I had shifted, in searcity 
of books and conveniences, to patch up among 
them, were received with written encomiums,

get of wretched barbarizing against the Latin

without a well-continued and judicious con-

Next (for hear me out now, readers), that I 
-may tell ye whither my ‘younger feet wandered; 
I betook me among those lofty fables and ro- 
mances, which recount in solemn cantos the deeds 
of knighthood founded by our victorious kings, 
and from hence had in renown over all Christen- 
dom. ‘There I read it in the oath of every knight, 
that he should defend to. the expense of his best 
-blood, or of his life, if it so befell him, the honor 
-and chastity of virgin or matron; from whence 
_ even then I learned what a noble virtue chastity 
sure must be, to the defense of which so many 
worthies, by such a dear adventure of themselves, 
had sworn. And if I found in the story after- 
ward, any of them, by word or deed, breaking 
that oath, I judged it the same fault of the poet, 
as that which is attributed to Homer, to have 
written indecent things of the gods. Only this 
my mind gave me, that every free and gentle 
spirit, without that oath, ought to be born a 
knight, nor needed to expect the gilt spur, or 
the laying of a sword upon his shoulder to stir 
him up both by his counsel and his: arms, to 
secure and protect the weakness of any attempted 
chastity. So that even these books, which to 
many others have been the fuel of wantonness 
and loose living, I can not think how, unless

IN DEFENSE OF BOOKS’ 
I pewny not, but that it is of greatest concern- 
ment in the Church and Commonwealth, to have 
a vigilant eye how books demean themselves as 
well as men; and thereafter to confine, imprison, 
and do sharpest justice on them as malefactors. 
For books are not absolutely dead things, but 
do contain a potency of life in them to be as 
active as that soul was whose progeny they are; 
nay, they do preserve as in a vial the purest 
efficacy and extraction of that living intellect 
that bred them. I know they are as lively, and 
as vigorously productive, as those fabulous drag- 
on’s teeth; and being sown up and down, may 
chance to spring up armed men. And yet, on 
the other hand, unless wariness be used, as good 
almost kill a man as kill a good book. Who 
kills a man kills a reasonable créature, God’s 
image; but he who destroys a good book, kills 
reason itself, kills the image of God, as it were. 
in the eye. "Many a man lives a burden ‘to the 
earth; but a good book is the precious life-blood. 
of a ‘master-spirit, embalmed and treasured up 
on purpose to a life beyond life. "Tis true, no age

  ean restore a life, whereof perhaps there is no 
great’ loss;-and revolutions of ages do not oft 
recover the loss of a rejected truth, for the want 
_ of which whole nations fare the worse. 
We should be wary therefore what persecution 
“we raise against the living labors of public men, 
* show we spill that seasoned life of man, preserved 
and stored up in books; since we see a kind 
-.0£ homicide may be thus committed, sometimes 
a martyrdom, and if it extend to. the whole im- 
~ pression, a kind of massacre; whereof the ex- 
ecution ends not in the slaying of an elemental 
life, but strikes at that ethereal and fifth essence, 
the breath of reason itself, slays an immortality 
rather than a ‘life. But lest I should be con- 
demned ‘of introducing license, while I oppose 
__ licensing, I refuse not the ‘pains to be so much 
historical, as will serve to show what hath been 
’.@one by ancient and famous commonwealths 
‘against this disorder, till the very time that this 
project of licensing crept out of the inquisition, 
‘was catched up by our prelates and hath caught 
some of'our presbyters. 
. In Athens, where books and wits were ever 
busiér than in any other part of Greece, I find 
but only two sorts of writings which the magis- 
trate cared to take notice of; those either blas- 
phemous and atheistical, or libelous. Thus the 
books of Protagoras were by the judges of Areo- 
‘pagus commanded to be burnt, and himself ban- 
ished the territory for a discourse begun with 
his confessing not to know ‘‘whether there were 
gods, or whether not.’’ And against defaming, it 
was agreed that none should be traduced by name, 
as was the manner of Vetus Comedia, whereby 
132
-P-A-G-E-138
  JOHN MILTON 
  we may guess how they censured libeling. And 
  this course was quick enough, as Cicero writes, . 
to quell both the desperate wits of other atheists, 
and the open way of defaming, as the event 
showed. Of other sects and opinions, tho tending 
to voluptuousness, and the denying of Divine 
Providence, they took no heed. - 
Therefore we do not read that either Epicurus, 
or that libertine school of Cyrene, or what the 
Cynic impudence uttered, was ever questioned by 
the laws. Neither is it recorded that the writings 
of. those old comedians were supprest tho the 
acting of them were forbid; and that Plato com- 
mended the reading of Aristophanes, the loosest: 
of them all, to his royal scholar Dionysius, is 
commonly known, and may be excused, if holy ° 
Chrysostom, as is reported, nightly studied so 
much the same author and had the art.to cleanse 
a scurrilous vehemence into the style of a rousing 
sermon. 
That other leading city of Greece, Lacedemon, 
considering that Lyeurgus, their lawgiver, was so 
addicted to. elegant learning, as to have been 
the first that brought out of Ionia the scattered 
works of Homer, and sent the poet Thales. from 
Crete to prepare and mollify the Spartan surli- 
ness with his smooth songs and odes, the better 
to plant among them law and civility, it is to 
be wondered how useless and unbookish they 
were, minding nought but the feats of war. There 
needed no licensing of books among them, for 
they disliked all but their own laconic apothegms, 
and took a.slight oceasion to chase Archilochus 
out of their city, perhaps for composing in a 
higher strain than their own. soldierly ballads

his: proad verses, they were not therein so cau- 
_ tigus,-but were as dissolute in their promiscuous 
conversing; whence Euripides affirms in ‘‘Andro- 
‘. mache,?? that their women were all unchaste. 
‘Thus much may give us light after what sort 
of books were prohibited among the Greeks. 
The’ Romans also for many ages trained up 
only to a military roughness, resembling most 
the Lacedwmonian guise, knew of learning little 
but what their twelve tables, and the Pontific 
College with their augurs and fiamens taught 
them in religion and law, so unacquainted with 
other learning, that when Carneades and Crito- 
laus, with the Stoic Diogenes, coming ambassadors 
to Rome, took thereby occasion to give the city 
a taste of their philosophy, they were suspected 
for sedueers by no less a man than Cato the 
€ensor, who moved it in the Senate to dismiss 
“', them speedily, and to banish all such Attie bab- 
blers out of Italy. But Scipio and others of the 
- _ noblest senators withstood him and his old Sabine 
’ austerity; honored and admired the men; and 
the censor himself at last, in his old age, fell 
to the study of that whereof before he was so 
scrupulous. And yet-at the same time, Nevius 
and Plautus, the first Latin comedians, had filled 
the city vith all. the borrowed scenes of Menan- 
der and Philemon. Then began to be considered 
there also what was to be done to libelous books 
and authors; for Nevius .was quickly cast into 
prison. for his unbridled pen, and released by 
the ‘tribunes upon his recantation; we read also 
that libels were burnt, and the makers punished 
by Augustus. The like severity, no doubt, was 
134

their esteemed gods. Except in these two points, 
how the world went in books, the magistrate kept -

as with their homage and their fealty, the ap- 
proaching Reformation: others as fast reading, 
trying all things, assenting to the force of reason 
and convincement. . What could a man require 
more from a nation so pliant and so. prone to

solicitude, honest perhaps tho over-timorous of - 
them that vex in this behalf, but shall laugh in 
the end at those malicious applauders of our 
differences, I have these reasons to persuade 
me...

Methinks I see her as an eagle mewing her 
mighty youth, and kindling her undazzled eyes

  confirmation of truth, how can we more safely, 
and with less danger, seout into the regions of 
sinand falsity than by reading all manner of 
tractates and hearing all manner of reason? And 
this is the benefit which may be had of books 
: promisenously read. 
‘But of the harm that may result, hence three 
kinds are usually reckoned. First, is feared the 
infection that may spread; but then all human 
...Jearning and controversy in religious points must 
remove out of the world, yea the Bible itself; 
for that ofttimes relates blasphemy not nicely, it 
‘describes the carnal sense of wicked men not 
unelegantly, it brings in holiest men passionately 
murmuring against Providence through all the 
arguments of Epicurus: in other great disputes 
it anawers ‘dubiously and darkly to the common 
reader. And ask ‘a ‘Talmudist what ails the 
‘~~ mhodesty of his marginal Keri, that Moses and 
‘sal the prophets ‘can not persuade him to pro- 
nounce the textual Chetiv. For these causes we 
all know the Bible itself put by the Papist into 
’ the first rank of prohibited books. The ancientest 
fathers must be next removed, as Clement of 
Alexandria, and that Eusebian book of Evan- 
gelie preparation, transmitting our ears through 
a hoard of heathenish obscenities to receive the 
Gospel. Who finds not that Irenzus, Epiphanius, 
‘Jerome, and others diseover more heresies than 
* they well confute, and that oft for heresy which 
is the truer opinion?

tongue, so long as we are sure those languages 
are known as well to the worst of men, who are 
both most able, and most diligent to instil the 
poison they suck, first into the eourts of princes, 
acquainting them with the choicest. delights, and 
eriticisms of sin. As perhaps did that Petronius 
whom Nero called his Arbiter, the master of his 
revels; and the notorious ribald of Arezzo,” 
dreaded and yet dear to the Italian courtiers. 
I name not him for posterity’s sake, whom Henry 
VIII named in merriment his vicar of hell. 
By whieh compendious way all the contagion 
that foreign books can infuse will find a passage 
to the people far easier and shorter than an . 
Indian voyage, tho it could be sailed either by 
the north of Cataio eastward, or of Canada 
westward, while our Spanish licensing gags the 
English press never so severely. 
But on the other side that infection which is 
from books of controversy in religion is more 
doubtful and dangerous to the learned than to 
the ignorant; and yet those books must be per- 
mitted untouched by the licenser. It will be 
hard to instance where any ignorant man hath 
been ever seduced by papistical book in English, 
unless it were commended and expounded to 
him by some of that clergy: and indeed all such ~ 
tractates, whether false or true, are as the proph- 
ecy of Isaiah was to the eunuch, not to be under- 
stood without a guide.

QUALITIES OF THE GOOD SCHOOL- 
MASTER* 
Tuere is searce any profession in the com- 
monwealth more necessary, which is so slightly 
performed. The reasons whereof I conceive to 
be these: First, young scholars make this calling. 
their refuge; yea, perchance, before they have 
taken any degree’in the university, commence 
schoolmasters in the country, as if nothing else 
were required to set up this profession but only 
a rod and a ferula. Secondly, others who are 
able, use it only as a passage to better prefer- 
ment to patch the rents in their present fortune, 
till they can provide a new‘one, and betake 
themselves to some more gainful calling, Thirdly, 
they are disheartened from doing their best with . 
the miserable reward which in some places they 
receive, being masters to their children and 
slaves to their parents. Fourthly, being grown 
rich, they grow negligent, and scorn to touch 
the sehool but by the proxy of the usher. But - 
see how well our schoolmaster behaves himself. 
His genins inclines him with delight to his 
profession. Some men had as well be school-

    boys as schoolmasters, to be tied to the school, 
as Cooper’s Dictionary’ and Scapula’s Lexicon 
are chained to the desk therein; and tho great 
‘scholars, and skilful in other arts, are bunglers 
in this. But God, of his goodness, hath fitted 
several men for several callings, that the neces- 
. sity of church and state, in all conditions, may 
‘be provided for. So that he who beholds the 
fabric thereof, may say, God hewed out the stone, 
and appointed it to lie in this very - place, for 
it would fit none other so well, and here it doth 
most excellent. And thus God moldeth some 
for a schoolmaster’s life, undertaking it with 
desire and delight, and discharging it with dex- 
terity and happy success. 
He studieth his scholars’ natures as carefully 
as they their books; and ranks their dispositions 
into several forms. And tho it may seem dif- 
ficult for him in a great school to descend to all 
particulars, yet experienced schoolmasters may 
. quickly make a grammar of boys’ ‘natures, and 
reduce them all—saving some few exceptions— 
to these general rules: 
1. Those that are ingenious and industrious. 
The conjunction of two sueh planets in a youth 
presage much gdod unto him. To such a lad 
a frown may be a whipping, and a whipping 
.a death; yea, where their master whips them 
onée, shame whips them all the week after. Such 
natures he useth with all gentleness. 
2. Those that are. ingenious and idle. These

  think with the hare in the fable, that running 
with snails—so they esunt the rest of their 
schoolfellows—they shall come soon enough to 
the post, tho sleeping a good. while before their 
starting. O! a good rod would finely take them 
napping! 
3. Those that are dull and diligent. Wines, 
the stronger they be, the more lees! they have 
when they are new.; Many boys are ‘muddy- 
headed till they be clhrified with age, and such 
afterward prove the best. Bristol diamonds are 
both bright, and squared, and-pointed by nature, 
and yet are soft and worthless; whereas Orient. 
ones in India are rough and rugged ‘naturally.

all the whipping in the world can make their 
parts which are naturally sluggish rise one min- 
ute before the hour nature hath appointed. : 
4. Those that are invincibly dull, and negligent’ 
also. Correction may reform the latter, not | 
amend the former. All the whetting in the world’ 
ean never set a razor’s edge on that which hath 
no steel in it. Such boys he consigneth over to 
other professions. Shipwrights and boat-makers

other carpenters refuse. Those may make ex-

dren to swallow, hanging clogs'on the nimble- 
ness of his own soul, that his scholars may go

exemption from his rod—to live, as it were, in

into money, and ransoming boys from the rod 
at. a set price. If he hath a stubborn youth, 
eorrection-proof, he, debaseth not his authority 
by contesting with him, but fairly, if he can, 
puts him away before his obstinacy hath infected 
others. 
He is moderate in inflicting deserved correc- 
. tion: Many a schoolmaster better answereth the 
name paidotribes than paidagogos, rather tearing 
his scholars’ flesh with whipping than giving 
them good. education. No wonder if his scholars 
hate the Muses, being presented unto them in 
thé shapes of fiends and furies.,

THE BENEFITS OF ADVERSITY* 
No man is more miserable than he that hath 
no adversity—that man is not tried whether he 
pe good or bad: and God never crowns those 
virtues which are only faculties and dispositions; 
but every act of virtue is an ingredient into 
reward. And we see many children fairly 
planted, whose parts of nature were never drest 
by art, nor ealled from the furrows of their 
first possibilities by discipline and institution, 
and they dwell forever in ignorance, and con- 
verse with beasts; and yet if they had been drest 
and exercised, might have stood at the chairs 
of princes, or spoken parables amongst the rulers 
of cities. Our virtues are but in the seed when 
the grace of God comes upon us first; but this 
grace must be thrown into broken furrows, and 
must twice feel the cold and twice feel the heat, 
and be softened with storms and showers, and 
then it will arise into fruitfulness and harvests. 
And what is there in the world to distinguish 
virtues from dishonors, or the valor of Cwsar

that can make anything rewardable but the labor 
and the danger, the pain and the difficulty? Vir- 
tue eould not be anything but sensuality if it 
were the entertainment of our senses and fond 
desires; and  Apicius had been the noblest of 
all the Romans, if feeding and great appetite 
and despising the severities of temperance had 
been the work and proper employment of a wise 
man. But otherwise do fathers and otherwise 
do mothers handle their children. These soften 
them with kisses and imperfect noises, with the 
pap and breast-milk of soft endearments; they 
rescue them from tutors and snatch them from 
discipline; they desire to keep them fat and 
warm, and their feet dry, and their bellies full: 
and then the children govern, and ery, and prove 
fools and troublesome, so long as the feminine 
‘republic does endure. 
But fathers—beeause they design to have their 
children wise and valiant, apt for counsel or 
for arms—send ‘them to severe governments, and 
tie them to study, to hard labor, and afflictive 
contingencies. They rejoice when the bold boy 
strikes a lion with his hunting-spear, and shrinks 
not when the beast comes to affright his early 
eourage.’ Softness is for slaves and beasts, for 
minstrels and useless persons, for’ such who can 
not ascend higher than the state of a fair ox or 
a servant entertained for vainer offices; but the 
man that designs his son for nobler employments

AN INTERVIEW WITH OLIVER CROM: WELL? : 
Artm Captain Drury had lodged me at the 
Mermaid, over against the Mews at Charing ~ 
Cross, he went to give the Protector an account 
of me. When he came to me again, he told me 
the Protector required that I should promise not 
to take up a carnal sword or weapon’ against 
him or the government, as it then was; and 
that I should write it in what words I saw good, 
and set my hand to it. I said little in reply 
to Captain Drury, but the next morning I was 
moved of the Lord to write a paper to the Pro- 
tector, by the name of Oliver Cromwell, wherein 
I did, in the presence of the Lord God, declare 
that I did deny the wearing or drawing of a 
‘‘earnal sword, or any other outward weapon, 
against him or any man; and that T was sent 
of God to stand a witness against all violence, 
and against the works of darkness, and to turn 
people from darkness to light; to bring them

‘gave.it to Captain Drury to hand to Oliver

gel at Whitehall. It was in a morning, before 
‘he was drest; and one Harvey, who had come 
..® little among friends, but was disobedient, 
waited upon him. 
‘When I came in, I was moved to say: ‘‘Peace 
be in this house’’; and I exhorted him to keep 
in the fear of God, that he might receive wisdom 
from Him; that by it he might ‘be ordered, and 
with it might order all things under his hand 
unto. God’s glory. I spoke much to him of 
truth}. and a great deal of discourse I had with 
him ‘about ‘religion, wherein he carried himself 
very wioderately. But he said we quarreled with 
the priests, whom he called ministers. I told 
him, ‘‘I did not quarrel with them, they quar- 
reled with me and my friends. But, said I, if 
‘we own the prophets, Christ, and the apostles, 
we can not. hold up such teachers, prophets, and 
shepherds, ag the prophets, Christ, and the apos- 
tles declared against; but we must declare against 
them by the same power and gpirit.’” Then I 
shewed him that the prophets, Christ, and the 
apostles, declared’ freely, and declared against 
them that ‘did. not declare freely; such as 
preachéd for filthy luere, divined for money, and 
preached for hire, and were eovetous and greedy, 
like the dumb dogs that could never have enough;

  and that they who have the same spirit that 
Christ, and the prophets, and the apostles had, 
could not but declare against all such now, as 
they did then. As I spoke, he several times 
said it was very good, and it was truth. I told 
him: ‘That all Christendom, so called, had the 
Scriptures, but they wanted the power and spirit 
that those had who gave forth the Scriptures, 
and that was the reason they were not in fellow- 
ship with the Son, nor with the Father, nor with 
the Scriptures, nor one with another. |) 
Many more words I had with him, but people — 
coming in, I drew a little back. As Iwas 
turning, he catched me by the hand, and-.with 
tears in his eyes said: ‘‘Come again to my honse, | 
for if thou and I were but an hour of a day . 
together, we should be nearer one to the other’’; .; 
adding, that he wished me no more ill than he 
did to his own soul. I told him, if he dia, he 
wronged his own soul, and admonished him to 
harken to God’s voice, that he might stand 
in His counsel, and obey it; and if he did ‘so, 
that would keep him from hardness of heart; « 
but if he did not hear God’s' voice, his heart 
would be hardened. He said it was true. Then. 
I went out; and when Captain Drury, eame out 
after me, he told me the lord Protector said 
I was at liberty, and might go whither I would. 
Then I was brought into a great hall, where 
the Protestor’s gentlemen were to dine. T asked 
them what they brought me thither for, They 
said it was by the Protector’s order, that T might 
dine with them. I bid them let the Protector 
know I would not eat of his bread, nor drink 
of his drink. When he heard this, he said:

‘‘Now:I.see there is a people risen that I can 
not win,’ either with gifts, honors, - offices, or 
places; ‘but. all other sects and people I ean.’ 
. Te. was told him again, ‘‘That we had forsook 
. our, own, and were not like to look for such 
things from him.’’? 
ft: Just before Cromwell's death, Fox had another inter- 
view with him of which he wrote: ‘The same day, taking 
‘;Doat, I. went-down (wp) to Kingston, and from thence to 
Hampton Court, to speak with the Protector about-the sui- 
ferings of. friends, I met him riding into Hampton Oourt 
‘Park; and before I came to him, as he rode at the head 
of his Jife-guard, I saw and felt a waft (whiff) of death 
go forth against him; and when I came to him he looked 
like a dead man. ‘After T had laid the sufferings of friends 
pefore him, and had warned him according as I was moved 
to speak to him, he bade me come to his house. So I re- 
turned ‘to Kingston, and the. next day. went up to Hampton 
Court to speak further with him. But when I came, Harvey, 
who was: one that waited on him, told. me the doctors were 
not willing that I should speak with him. So I passed 
,' away, and never saw him more.” 
‘Oarlyle in his “Life and Letters of Cromwell,” quoting 
this passage, says: ‘His life, if thou knew it, has not been 
& merry thing for this man,. now or heretofore! I fancy 
he has been looking this long while to give it up, whenever 
the Commander-in-chief required. To quit his laborious 
sentry-post; honorably lay up his arms, and be gone to bis 
rest—all eternity to rest in, George! Was thy own life 
merry, for example, in the hollow of the tree; clad per-

A DREAM OF THE CELESTIAL CITY 
. Now I saw in my dream that by this time the 
pilgrims were got over the Enchanted -Ground, 
and entering into the country of Beulah, whose 
air was very sweet and pleasant, the way lying 
directly through it, they solaced them there’ for 
the season. Yea, here they heard continually 
the singing of birds, and saw every day the 
flowers appear in the earth, and heard the voice, 
of the turtle in the land. In this. country. the 
sun shineth night and day; wherefore it was 
beyond the Valley of the Shadow of Death,. and 
also out of the reach of Giant Despair; neither 
could they from this place so much ‘as see 
Doubting Castle. Here they were within sight 
of the city they were going to;. also here met 
them some of thé inhabitants thereof: for in

  this lend the shining ones commonly walked, 
because it was upon the borders of Heaven. In 
this, Jand, also, the contract between the bride 
‘and’ bridegroom was renewed; yea, here, ‘‘as 
he bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so did 
“their God rejoice over them.’? Here they had 
<0 want of corn and wine; for in this place they 
“ maet abundance of what they had sought for in 
_ gill their pilgrimage. Here they heard voices 
“” from out of the city, loud voices, saying: ‘‘Say 
» ye to the daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation 
' cometh! Behold, his reward is with him!’’ Here 
all the inhabitants of the country called them 
‘the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, 
sought out,’’ ete. 
Now, as they walked in this land, they had 
more rejoicing than in parts more remote from 
‘the Kingdom to which they were. bound; and 
. drawing nearer to the eity yet, they had a more 
perfect view thereof: it was built of pearls and 
precious stones, also the streets thereof were 
paved with gold; so that, by reason of the nat- 
ural glory of the city, and the reflection of the 
sunbeams upon it, Christian with desire fell sick; 
Hopeful: algo had a fit or two of the same dis- 
ease: wherefore here they lay by it a while, 
erying out, because of their pangs: ‘‘If you see 
my Beloved, tell him that I am sick of love.”’ 
', But being a little strengthened, and better 
able to bear their sickness, they walked on their 
way, and came yet nearer and nearer, where 
were orchards, vineyards, and gardens, and their 
gates opened into the highway. Now, as they 
éame up to these places, behold the gardener 
stood in the way, to whom the pilgrims said: 
166
-P-A-G-E-170
  JOHN BUNYAN   
Whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these? 
He answered: They are the King’s, and are 
planted here for his own delight, and also for 
the solace of pilgrims: so the gardener had them 
into the vineyards and bid them refresh them- 
selves with dainties; he also shewed them there 
the King’s walks and arbors, where he delighted 
to be; and here they tarried and slept. 
Now, I beheld in my dream that they talked 
more in their sleep at this time than ever they 
did in all their journey; and being in a muse 
thereabout, the gardener said even to me: Where- 
fore musest thou at the matter? It is the nature 
of the fruit of the grapes of these vineyards 
to go down so sweetly, as to cause the lips of 
them that are asleep to speak. 
So I saw that when they awoke, they addrest 
themselves to go up to the city. But, as I said, 
the reflection of the sun upon the city—for the 
eity was pure gold—was so extremely glorious, 
that they could not as yet with open face behold 
it, but through an instrument made for that 
purpose. So I saw that, as they went.on, there 
met them two men.in raiment that shone like, 
gold; also their faces shone as the light. 
These men asked the pilgrims whence they 
came; and they told them. They also asked them 
where they had lodged, what difficulties and 
dangers, what comforts and pleasures, they had 
met with in their way; and they told them. Then 
said the men that met them: You have but two 
difficulties more to meet with, and then you are 
in the city. 
Christian and his companion then asked the 
men to go along with them; so they told them 
167
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  that they would. But, said-they, you must ob- 
tain it by your’ own faith. So I. saw in my 
dream that they went on together till they came 
in sight of the gate... + ‘ 
‘When I saw in my dream that Christian was 
. inva muse a while. To whom, also, Hopeful 
“added these words: Be of good cheer; Jesus 
Christ maketh thee whole: and with that Chris- 
_ tian brake out with a loud voice—Oh! I see 
him again; and he tells me: ‘*When thou passest 
through the waters, I will be with thee; and 
‘through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee.’’ 
Then they both took courage, and the enemy 
‘was after that as still as a stone, until they 
‘were gone over. Christian, therefore, presently 
found ground to stand upon, and so it followed 
that: the rest of the river was but shallow; but 
thus they got over.« Now, upon the bank of 
. thé river on the other side, they saw the two 
shinitg men again, who there waited for them; 
wherefore, being come out of the river, they 
saluted them, saying ‘‘We are ministering spir- 
its, ‘sent for to miinister to those that shall be 
heirs of salvation.’’ Thus they went along to- 
ward the gate. Now you must note that the 
city stood upon a. mighty hill;. but the pilgrims 
went up that hill with ease, because they had 
these two men to lead: them up by the arms; 
‘they had likewise left their mortal garments 
behind them in the river; for tho they went in 
with them, they came out without them. They 
thérefore went up here with much agility and 
speed, tho the foundation upon which the ‘city 
was framed was higher than the clouds.

THE DEATH OF VALIANT-FOR-TRUTH 
AND OF STAND-FAST? . 
Jr was noised abroad that Mr Valiant-for-truth 
was taken with a Summons by the same: Post 
as the other, and had this for a Token. that 
the Summons was true, That his Pitcher was 
broken at-the Fountain. When he understood 
it, he called for his Friends,: and told them of 
it. Then said he, I am going to my Fathers, 
and tho with great difficulty I am. got hither, 
yet now I do not repent me of all the Trouble 
I have been at to arrive where I am. . My. Sword 
I give to. him that shall succeed me in my

When the day that he must go hence was come,

which as he went he said, Death, where is thy 
Sting? And as he went down deeper. he said, 
Grave, where is thy Victory? So he passed 
over, and all-the Trumpets sounded for him 
on the other side. 
Then there came forth a Summons for Mr

it him open. in his hands. The contents whereof

_ Message, for here is a Token of the Truth there- 
of, Thy Wheel is broken at the Cistern. Then 
‘he called to him Mr Great-heart who was their

my hap to be much in your good Company in 
. the days of my Pilgrimage, yet since the time 
_I_ knew you, you have been profitable to me. 
When I came from home, I left behind me a 
Wife and five smal! Children, let me entreat 
you at your return (for I know that you will 
go and return to your Master’s house, in hopes 
that you. yet be a Conductor to more of the 
holy. Pilgrims), that you send to my Family, 
‘and let them be acquainted with all that hath 
and shall happen unto me. Tell them moreover 
of. my happy Arrival to this place, and of the 
present late blessed condition that I am in. Tell 
them. also of Christian and Christiana his Wife, 
and how she and her Children came after her

she made and whither she is gone. I have little 
or nothing to send to my Family, except it be 
Prayers and Tears for them; of which it will 
suffice if thou acquaint them, if peradventure 
they may prevail. : 
When Mr Stand-fast had thus set things in ‘order, and the time being come for him to haste 
him away, he also went down to the River. Now 
there was a great Calm at that time in the River; wherefore Mr Stand-fast, when he was

ANCIENT VANITY FAIR* 
Turn I saw in my Dream, that. when they 
were got out of the Wilderness, they presently 
saw @ Town before them, and the name of that 
Town is Vanity; and at the Town there is a 
Fair kept, called Vanity Fair: it is kept all the 
year long; it beareth the name of Vanity Fair, 
‘ because the Town where ’tis kept is lighter than 
Vanity; and also because all that is there sold, 
or that cometh thither, is Vanity. As is the 
saying of the wise, All that cometh is Vanity. 
This Fair is no new erected business, but a 
thing of ancient standing;.I will shew you the 
_ original of it. 
¢ —~ Almost five thousand years agorie, there were 
* Pilgrims walking to the Celestial City, as these 
two honest persons are; and Beelzebub, Apollyon, 
and Legion, with their Companions, perceiving 
by. the path that the Pilgrims made, that their 
way to the city lay throngh this Town of Vanity, 
? From “The Pilgrim’ 's Progress.” 
172
-P-A-G-E-176
i RR 
JOHN BUNYAN . erie nannies 
they contrived here to set up a Fair; a Fair 
wherein should be sold of all sorts of Vanity, 
and that it should last all the year long: there- 
fore at this Fair are all such Merchandise sold, 
as Houses, Lands, Trades, Places, Honors, Pre- 
ferments, Titles, Countries, Kingdoms, Lusts, 
Pleasures, and Delights of all sorts, as Whores, 
Bawds, Wives, Husbands, Children, Masters, 
Servants, Lives, Blood, Bodies, Souls, Silver, Gold, 
Pearls, Precious Stones, and what not. . . . 
Now, as I said, the way to the Celestial City 
lies just through this Town where this lusty 
Fair is kept; and he that will go to the City, 
and yet not go through this Town, must needs 
go out of the World. The Prince of Princes 
himself, when here, went through this Town to — 
his own Country, and that upon a Fair-day too; 
yea, and as I think, it was Beelzebub, the chief 
Lord of this Fair, that invited him to buy of 
his:. Vanities: yea, would have made him Lord 
of the Fair, would he but have done him rever- 
ence as he went through the Town. Yea, be- 
cause he was such a person of honor, Beelzebud 
had him from Street to’ Street, and shewed him 
all the Kingdoms of the World in a little time, 
that he might (if possible) allure that Blessed 
One to cheapen and buy some of his Vanities. 
But he had no mind to the Merchandise, and 
therefore left the Town, without laying out so 
much as one Farthing upon these Vanities. This 
Fair therefore is an ancient thing, of long stand- 
ing, and a very great Fair. . . . . 
The Pilgrims being patient, and not rendering 
railing for railing, bat contrarywise blessing, and 
giving good words for bad, and kindness for

  injuries done, some men in the Fair that were 
more. observing, and less prejudiced than the 
rest, began to check and blame’ the baser sort 
_ for their continual abuses done by them to the 
: men; they therefore in angry manner let fly at 
_ them-again, counting them as bad as the men 
“dn the Cage, and telling them that they seemed 
. confederates, and should be made partakers of 
their misfortunes. The other replied, that for 
‘ought they could see, the men were quiet, and 
‘. sober, and intended nobody any harm; and that 
there were many that traded in their Fair that 
were more worthy to be put into the Cage, yea, 
and Pillory too, than were the men that they 
had abused. Thus, after divers words had passed 
on both sides (the men behaving themselves all 
the while very wisely and soberly before them), 
they fell to some blows among themselves, and 
did harm one to another. Then were these two 
Poor men brought before their examiners again, 
“and there charged as being guilty of the late 
‘hubbub that had been in the Fair. So they 
beat them pitifully and hanged irons upon them, 
and led them in chaines up and down the Fair, 
for an example and a terror to others, lest any 
should further speak in their behalf, or join 
themselves unto them. But Christian and Faith- 
ful: behaved themselves yet more wisely, and 
received the ignominy and shame that was cast 
upon them, with so much meekness and patience, 
that it, won to their side (tho but few in 
comparison of the rest) several of the men in 
the Fair. This put the other party yet into a 
greater rage, insomuch that they concluded. the 
death of these two men. Wherefore they threat-

tarn, but that they should die, for the abu: 
had done, and for deluding the men of the Fair. 
Behold Vanity Fair; the Pilgrims there 
Are ehained and stoned. beside; 
Even so it was, our Lord past. ‘here, 
And on Mount Calvary died.. 
Then were they remanded to the Cage again, 
until further order should be taken with them. 
So they put them in, and made their feet: fast 
in the Stocks. 
Here also they called again io ‘mind what they 
had heard from their faithful friend Evangelist, 
and were the more confirmed in their way and — 
sufferings, by what he told them would happen 
to them. They also now comforted each other, 
that whose lot it was to suffer, even he should 
have the best on’t; therefore each man secretly 
wished that he might have that. preferment: but 
committing themselves to the Allwise dispose 
of Him that ruleth all things, with much eontent 
‘they abode in the condition in which they were, | 
until they should be otherwise disposed of. 
Then a convenient time being appointed, they - 
brought them forth to their Tryal, in order to . 
their eondemnation. When the time was come, 
they were brought before their enemies, and ar- 
raigned. The Judge’s name was Lord Hate-good. 
Their Indietment was one and the same.in sub- 
stanee, tho somewhat varying in form, the 
contents whereof was this: 
That they were enemies to and disturbers of . 
their Trade; that they had made Commotions and

  Divisions’ in the Town, and had- wow a: party to 
their. “most dangerous Opinions in contempt 
oft the Law of their Prince. 
Now Faithful play the Man, speak for thy God: 
Fear not the wickeds’ malice, nor their rod: 
‘|, Speak boldly man, the Truth is on thy side; 
“Die for it, and to Life in triumph ride.    
‘Then Faithful began to answer, that he had 
only set himself against that which had set itself 
against Him that is higher than the highest. And 
said he, as for Disturbance, I make none, being 
myself a man-of Peace; the Party that were 
won to us, were won by beholding our Truth and 
Tnnocence, and they are only turned from the 
worse to the better. And as to the King you 
talk of, since he is Beelzebub, the enemy of our 
Lord, Tt defy him and all his “Angels. 
Then Proclamation was made, that they that 
had aught to say for their Lord the King against 
the Prisoner at thé Bar, should forthwith appear 
and give in their evidence. So there came in 
three witnesses, to wit, Envy, Superstition, and 
Pickthank, They were then asked if they knew 
the Prisoner’ at the Bar; and what they had te 
‘ say. for their Lord the King against him. 
Then stood forth Envy, and. said to this effect: 
My Lord, I have known this man a long time, 
and will attest upon my Oath before’ this hon- 
orable Bench, that he is— 
Judge. Hold! Give him his Oath. 
So. they sware him.

are yet in our sins, and finally shall be damned; 
and. thjs.is that. which I have to say. 
Then was Pickthank sworn, and bid say what 
he Knew, in behalf of their Lord the King, against 
the prisoner at the Bar. . 
Pick. My Lord, and you, Gentlemen all, This 
fellow I have known of a long time, and have 
vheard him speak things that ought not to be

Beelzebub, and hath spoken contemptibly of his 
_ honorable Friends, whose. names are the Lord. 
Old Man, the Lord Carnal Delight, the Lord 
Luxurious, the Lord Desire of Vain Glory, my 
old Lord Lechery, Sir Having Greedy, with all 
the rest of our Nobility; and he hath said more- 
over, That if all men were of his mind, if pos- 
sible, there is not one of these Noblemen should 
have any longer a being ‘in this Town; besides, 
he hath not been afraid to rail on you, my Lord, 
who are now appointed to be his Judge, calling 
you an ungodly villain, with many other suech- 
like vilifying terms, with which he hath. bespat- 
tered most of the Gentry of our Town. 
"When this Pickthank had told his tale, the 
Judge directed his speech to the Prisoner at the 
Bar, saying, Thou Runagate, Heretick, and Trai- 
tor, hast thou heard what these honest Gentle- 
men have witnessed against thee? 
Faith. May I speak a few words in my own 
defense? 
- Judge. Sirrah, sirrah, thou deservest to live

towards thee, let us see what thou hast to say.

  Envy-hath spoken, I never said ought but this, 
That what Rule or Laws or Custom or People, 
were flat against the Word of God, are diamet- 
rically opposite to Christianity. If I have said 
amiss in this, convince me of my error, and I 
am ready here before you to make my reeanta- 
tion. 
2. As to the second, to wit, Mr Superstition, 
and his charge against me, t said only this, 
That in the’ worsmip of God there is required @ 
Divine Faith; but there can be no Divine Faith 
without a Divine ‘Revelation of the will of God: 
therefore whatever is thrust into the Worship of 
God that is not agreeable to a Divine Revelation, 
cannot be done but by an human faith; which faith 
will not profit to Eternal Life. 
3. As to what Mr Pickthank hath said, I say_ 
(avoiding terms, as that I am said-to rail, and 
the like) that the Prince of this Town, with all 
the rabblement his attendants, by this Gentle- 
man named, are more fit for a being in: ‘Hell, 
than in this Town and Country: and 80, the 
Lord have mercy upon me. .

Mr Blind-Man, Mr No-good, Mr Malice, Mr 
Love-lust, Mr Live-loose, Mr Heady, Mr High-

gave in his private Verdict against him among 
themselves, and afterwards unanimously. con- 
eluded to bring him in guilty before the Judge.

they did; therefore he was presently condemned 
to be had from the place where he was, to the

To begin, then, with Shakespeare. He’ ‘was the 
man who, of all modern, and perhaps aneient 
poets, had the largest and most comprehensive 
soul. All the images of nature were still. present 
to him, and he drew them not laboriously, but - 
luckily. When he deseribes anything, you more. 
than see it—you feel it too. Those who accused 
him to have wanted learning, give him the greater 
commendation. He was naturally learned; he 
needed not the spectacles of books to read na- 
ture; he looked inwards, and. found her there. 
I cannot say he is everywhere alike; were he so, 
I should do him injury to compare him with 
the greatest of mankind. He is many times flat, 
insipid; his comic wit degenerating inte elenches, 
his serious swelling into bombast. But he is 
always great when some great occasion is pre- 
sented to him; no man can say be ever had a 
fit subject for bis wit, and did not them raise 
himself as high above the rest of poets.

  Eton® ‘say, that there was no subject of which 
any poet ever writ, but he would produce it 
much ‘better done in Shakespeare; and however 
- othérs are now generally preferred. before him, 
yet ‘the age wherein he lived, which had contem- 
poraries with him Fletcher and Jonson, never 
equalled them to him in their esteem. And in 
‘the last king’s court, when Ben’s reputation was 
at highest, Sir John Suckling, and with him the 
greater part of the courtiers, set our Shakespeare 
far above him. . . . 
Beaumont and Fletcher, of whom I am next 
to speak, had with the advantage of Shakespeare’s 
wit, which was their precedent, great natural 
gifts, improved: by study; Beaumont especially, 
being so accurate a judge of plays, that Ben 
Jonson, while be lived, submitted all his wri- 
tings ‘to his censure, and .’tis thought, used his 
judgment in correcting, if' not. contriving, all 
his plots. What.value he had for him, appears 
by the verses he writ to. him, and- therefore I 
need speak no farther of it. The first play that 
brought Fletcher and him in esteem was their 
“‘Philaster’?; for before that they had written 
two or three very unsuccessfully: as the like is re- 
ported of Ben Jonson, before he writ ‘‘Every Man 
in his Humor.’’ Their plots were generally more 
regular than Shakespeare’s, especially those which 
were made before Beaumont’s death; and they 
understood and imitated the conversation of gen- 
tlemen much better; whose wild debancheries, 
and quickness of wit in repartees, no poet before

  them could paint as they have done. Humor, 
which Ben Jonson derived from particular per- 
sons, they made it not their business to describe; 
they represented all the passions very lively, but 
above all, love. I am apt to believe the English 
language in them arrived to its highest perfec- 
tion: what words have since been taken in, are 
rather superfluous than ornamental. Théir plays 
are now the most pleasant and frequent enter- 
tainments of the stage; two of theirs being acted 
through the year, for one of Shakespeare’s or 
Jonson’s: the reason is, because there is a cer- 
tain gaiety in their comedies, and pathos in their 
more serious ‘plays, which suits generally with 
all men’s humors. Shakespeare’s language is like- 
wise a little obsolete, and Ben Jouson’s wit comes 
short of theirs. 
As for Jonson, to whose character I am ‘now 
arrived, if we look upon him while he was him- 
self—for his last plays’ were but his dotages— 
I think him the most learned and judicious 
writer which any theater ever had. He was a 
most severe judge of himself, as well as others. 
One can not say he wanted wit, but rather that 
he was frugal of it. In his works “you find 
little to retrench or alter. Wit, and language, 
and humor also in some measure, we had before 
him; but something of art was wanting to the 
drama, till he came. He managed his strength 
to more advantage than any who preceded him. 
You seldom find him making love in any of his 
scenes, or endeavoring to move the ‘passions; 
his genius was too sullen and saturnine to do 
it gracefully, especially when he knew he came 
after those who had performed both to such

  a heigkt. .Humor was his proper sphere; and 
in that he delighted most to represent mechanic 
people. He was deeply conversant in the an- 
cients, both Greek and Latin,.and he borrowed 
‘boldly from them; there is scarce a poet or 
‘historian among the Roman authors of those times 
swhom he has not translated in ‘‘Sejanus’’ and 
 “'Catiline.’? But he has. done his robberies so 
openly that one may see he fears not to be taxed 
by any law. He invades authors like a monarch; 
and what would be theft in other poets, is only 
victory in him. With the spoils of these writers 
he 86 represents old Rome. to us, in its rites, 
ceremonies, and customs, that if one of their 
poets had written either of his tragedies, we 
had seen less of it than in him: 
If there was any fault in his langnage, *twas 
that he weaved it.too.closely and laboriously, 
in his eomedies especially: perhaps, too, he did 
'a little too much Romanize our tongue, leaving 
‘the words which he translated almost as much 
‘Latin.as he found them; wherein, tho he learned- 
ly. followed their language, he did not enough 
eomply with the idiom of ours. If I would 
‘compare him with Shakespeare, I must acknowl- 
edge him the more correct poet, but Shakespeare 
the greater wit. Shakespeare was the Homer, or 
ther of our. dramatic poets; Jonson was the 
Wirgil, the pattern of elaborate writing; I admire 
- him, but I Jove Shakespeare. To conclude of him: 
as he has given us. the most correct plays, so, 
in the precepts which he has laid down in his 
‘*Digeoveries,’’? we have as many and profitable 
rules for perfecting the stage, as any. wherewith 
the French can furnish us.

March 2, 1667.—After dinner, with my wife, to 
the King’s house to see The Maiden Queene, a 
‘new play of Dryden’s mightily commended for 
the regularity of it, and the strain and wit; and, 
the truth is, there is a comical part done by Nell 
_Gwynne, which is. Florimell, that I never can 
hope ever to see the Jike done again, by man or 
woman. “The King and Duke of York were at 
‘tthe play. But so great performance of a comical

./ is concluded; for he did ‘stand where he did hear 
“part o£ the discourse st the Council table, and 
there did: hear the King argue for it. . 
_ «Among other things that the spirits of the sea- 
“men were down, and the forces of our enemies 
are grown too great and many for us, and he 
would not have his subjects overprest, for he 
kmew an Englishman would do as mueh as any 
_ Iaan’:upon, hopeful terms; but where he sees he 
is overprest, he despairs soon as any other; and 
besides that, they have already such a load of 
'.. dejeétion upon them, that they will not be in 
‘temper a.good. while again. He heard my Lord 
Chancellor say to the King, ‘‘Sir,’’ says he, ‘‘the 
whole world do complain publickly of treachery, 
that things have been managed falsely by some 
of his great ministers.’’ ‘‘Sir,’’ says he, ‘‘I am 
for your Majesty’s falling into a speedy enquiry 
inte the truth of it, and, where you meet with 
* it; punish it, But, at the same time, consider 
what you have to do, and make use of your time 
-for having a peace; for more money will not be 
given without much trouble, nor is it, I fear, to 
be ‘had of the' people, nor. will a little do it to 
put us into condition of doing our business.’” 
Bat Sir H. Cholmly tells me he (the Chancellor) 
did say the other day at his table, ‘‘Treachery,”’ 
says he} ‘I could wish we could prove there was 
198

anything of that in it; for that would imply 
some wit and thoughtfulness; but we are ruined 
merely by folly and neglect.’?, And so Sir H. _ 
Cholmly tell me they did all argue for peace and 
so he do believe that the King hath agreed to 
the three points Mr. Coventry brought over, 
which I have mentioned before, and. is gone with 
them back. . . . : 
While we were at the Excise Office talking with 
Mr. Ball, i was computed that the Parliament 
had given the King for this war only, besides 
all prizes, and besides the £200,000 which he was 
to spend of his own revenue to guard the sea, 
above £5,000,000 and odd £100,000; which: is @ 
most prodigious sum. Sir H. Cholmly, as.a true 
English gentleman, do decry the King’s expenses 
of his Privy-purse, which in King James’s time 
did not rise to above £5,000 a year, and in King 
Charles’s to £10,000, do now cost us above £100,- 
000 besides the great charge of the Monarchy, 
as the Duke of York £100,000 of it, and other 
limbs of the Royal family, and the guards, which, 
for his part, says he, ‘‘I would have all dis- 
banded, for the King is not the better by them, 
and would be as safe without them; for we have 
had no rebellions to make him fear anything.’’ 
But contrarily, he is now raising of a land army, 
which this Parliament and Kingdom will never 
bear, besides, the commanders they put over them 
are such as will never be able to raise or com- 
mand them; but the design is, and the Duke of 
York he says, is hot for it, to have a land army, - 
and so to make the government like that of - 
France, but our princes have not brains, or at 
least care and forecast enough to do that.

He was bred up the first twelve years of his life

great a erown, After that, he passed through 
eighteen years of great inequalities; unhappy in 
the war, in the loss of his father, and of the 
erown of England. Sectland did not only receive 
him, tho upon terms hard of digestion, but made 
an attempt upon England for him, tho a feeble 
one. He lost the battle of Worcester with too 
much indifference. And then he shewéd more 
eare of his person than became one who had so 
much at stake. He wandered about England for 
ten weeks after that, hiding from place.to place. 
But, under all the apprehensions. he had then 
upon him, he shewed a temper so careless, and

  so much turned to levity, that he was then di- 
verting himself with little household sports, in as 
utieoneerned a manner as if he had made no loss, 
‘and.had been in no danger at all. He got at last 
out of England. But he had been obliged to so 
“many who had been faithful to him, and careful 
of him, that he seemed ‘afterwards to resolve to 
‘make an equal return to them all; and finding it 
- not easy to reward them all as they deserved, 
he forgot them all alike. Most princes seem to 
have this pretty deep in them, and to think that 
they ought not to remember past services, but 
that their acceptance of them is a full reward. 
He, of all in our age, exerted this piece of pre- 
rogative in the amplest manner; for he never 
seemed to charge his memory, or to trouble his 
thoughts, with the sense of any of the services 
‘that-had been done him. 
_o. While he was abroad at Paris, Cologne, or 
Brussels, he never ‘seemed to lay anything to 
heart. He pursued all his diversions and ir- 
regular pleasures in a free career, and seemed 
to. be as serene under the loss of a crown as the 
greatest philosopher could have been. Nor did 
he willingly hearken to any of those projects 
with which he often complained that his chan- 
eellor persecuted him. That in which he seemed 
most concerned was, to find money for supporting 
his expense. And it was often said, that if 
Cromwell would have compounded the maiter, 
and have given him a good round pension, that 
he might have been induced to resign his title 
to him. During his exile,-he delivered himself so 
entirely to his pleasures, that he became in- 
eapable of application. He spent little of his 
196
-P-A-G-E-200
  GILBERT BURNET 
  time in reading or study, and yet less in thinking. 
And in the state his affairs were then in, he ac- 
eustomed himself to say to every person, and 
upon all occasions, that which he thought would 
please most; so that words or promises went very + 
easily from him. And he had so ill an opinion 
of mankind, that he thought the great art of 
living and governing was, to manage all things 
and all persons with a depth of, craft and dis- 
simulation. And in that few men in the world 
could put on the appearances of sincerity better 
than he could; under which so much artifice was 
usually hid, that in conelusion he could deceive 
none, for all were beeome mistrustful ef him. 
He had great vices, but scarce any virtues to. 
correct them. He had in him some vices that’. 
were less hurtful, which corrected his more hurt- 
ful ones. He was, during the active part of life, 
given up to sloth and lewdness to such a degree, 
that he hated business, and could not bear the 
engaging in anything that gave him much trouble, 
or put him under any constraint. And tho. he 
desired to become absolute, and to overturn both 
our religion and our laws, yet he would neither 
yun the risk, nor give himself the. trouble, which 
so great a design required. He had an appear- 
ance of gentleness in his outward deportment; 
but he seemed to have no bowels nor tenderness 
in his nature, and in the end of his life he became 
eruel. He was apt to forgive all crimes, even 
blood itself, yet he never forgave anything that 
was done against himself, after his first and gen- 
eral act of indemnity, which was to be reckoned. 
as done rather upon maxims of state than in- 
clinations ef merey. He delivered himself up 
197 :
-P-A-G-E-201

  to a most‘ enormous course.of vice, without any 
sort of. restraint, even from the consideration 
of :the: nearest relations. The most studied ex- 
travagances that way seemed, to the very last, 
to'be much delighted in and pursued by him. He 
had the art of making all people grow fond of 
him at first, by a softness in his whole way of 
conversation, as he was certainly the best-bred 
man of the age. But when it apeared how little 
could be built on his promise, they were cured 
of the fondness that he was apt to raise in them. 
‘When he saw young men of quality, who had 
something more than ordinary in them, he drew 
them about him, and ‘set himself to corrupt them 
both in religion and morality; in which he proved 
so unhappily suceessful, that he left England 
much changed at his death from what he had 
found it at his réstoration. . 
He loved to talk over all the stories of his 
life to every new man fhat came about him. His 
stay in Scotland, and the share he had in the 
‘war of Paris, in carrying messages from one side 
to the other, were his common topics. He went 
over these in a very graceful manner, but so 
often and so copiously, that all those who had 
been long accustomed to them grew weary of 
them; and when he entered on those stories, they 
usually withdrew: so that he often began them 
in a full audience, and before he had done, there 
were not above four or five persons left about 
him: which drew a severe jest from Wilmot, Earl 
of Rochester.? He said he wondered to see a

and yet not remember that he had told it to the

I took in. I had so much presence of mind as 
well as breath left, that seeing myself nearer 
the mainland than I expected, I got upon my 
feet, and endeavored to make on toward the land 
as I could, before another wave should return 
and take me up again; but I soon found it was 
impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea coming

te contend with: my business was to hold my 
breath, and, raise myself upon the water, if I 
could;, and so by swimming to preserve my 
breathing, and pilot myself toward the shore 
if possible; my greatest concern now being that 
the’ wave, as it would carry me a great way to- 
“ward, the shore when it came on, might not carry 
me back again with it when it gave back toward 
the. sea. 
“The wave that.came upon me again buried me 
at once twenty or thirty feet deep in its own 
body; and I could feel myself carried with a 
mighty force and swiftness toward the shore, a 
very great way; but I held my breath, and 
assisted myself to swim still forward with all 
my might. I was ready to burst with holding 
my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so 
‘to my immediate relief I’ found my head and 
‘hands shoot out above the surface of the water; 
tind tho it was not two ‘seconds of time that I 
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, 
gave me breath and new courage. I was covered 
again with water a good while, but not so long 
but I held it out; and finding the water had 
spent itself, and began to return, I struck for- 
ward against the return of the waves, and felt 
ground ‘again with my feet. I stood still a few 
moments to recover breath, and till the water 
went from me, and then took to my heels and 
ran with what strength I had farther toward 
the shore. But neither would this deliver me 
from the fury of the sea, which came pouring 
in after me again; and twice more I was lifted 
up by the waves and carried forward as before, 
‘the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well-nigh been 
fatal to me; for the sea having hurried me along 
as before, landed me, or rather dashed me 
against a piece of rock, and that with such force 
that it left me senseless, and indeed helpless as 
to my own deliverance; for the blow taking my 
side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite 
out of my body, and had it returned again im- 
mediately I must have been strangled in the 
water; but I recovered a little before the return 
of the waves, and seeing I should again be 
covered with the water, I resolved to hold fast 
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath 
if possible till the wave went back. Now, as the 
waves were not so high as the first, being nearer 
land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and 
then fetched another run, which brought me so 
near the shore that the next wave, tho it went 
over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to 
carry me away; and the next run I took, I got 
to the mainland, where to my great comfort I 
elambered up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me 
down upon. the grass, free from danger and 
quite out of the reach of the water. ee 
I was now landed, and safe on. shore; and 
began to look up and thank God that my life 
was saved, in'a case wherein there were, some 
minutes before, scarce any room to hope. I 
believe it is impossible to express, to the life, 
what the eestasies and transports’ of the soul 
are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of 
the grave: and I did not wonder now at the 
custom, viz., that when a malefaetor who has 
the halter about his neck is tied up, and just 
going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought

a surgeon: with it, to let him blood that very 
moment: they tell him of it; that the surprize 
may not drive the animal spirits from the heart 
and.overwhelm him. 
“For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.’’ 
I walked about the shere, lifting up my hands, 
and my whole being, as I may say, wrapt up in 
the contemplation of my deliverance; making a 
thousand gestures and motions which I can not 
describe; reflecting upon my comrades that were 
drowned, and that there should not be one soul 
saved but myself; for as for them, I never saw 
them afterward, or any sign of them, except 
three of the hats, one cap, and two shoes that 
were not fellows.’

Axnour a year and a half after I entertained 
these notions (and by long musing had, as it 
were, resolved them all into nothing, for want 
of ‘an oceasion to put them in execution), I was 
surprized one morning early by seeing no less 
than five canoes all on shore together on my side 
the island, and the people who belonged to them 
all landed and out of my sight. The number of 
them broke all my measures; for seeing so many,

and knowing that they always came four or six, 
or sometimes more, in a boat, I could not tell 
what to think of it, or how to take my measures 
to attack twenty or thirty men single-handed; 
so lay still in my castle, perplexed and discom- 
forted. However, I put myself into all the same 
postures for an attack that I had formerly pro- 
vided, and was just ready for action, if anything 
had presented. Having waited a good while, 
listening to hear if they made any noise, at 
length, being very impatient, I set my guns at ~ 
the foot of my ladder, and clambered up. to the 
top of the hill, by my two stages, as usual; stand- 
ing so, however, that my head did not appear 
above the hill, so that they could not perceive 
me by any means. Here I observed, by the help 
of my perspective glass, that they were no less 
than thirty in number; that they had a_fire 
kindled, and that they had meat drest. How 
they had cooked it, J knew not, or what it was; 
but they were all dancing, in I know not how 
many barbarous gestures and figures, their own 
way, round the fire, 
While I was thus looking on them, I perceived, 
by my perspective, two miserable wretehes 
dragged from the boats, where, it seems, they were 
laid by, and were now brought out for the slaugh- 
ter. I perceived one of them immediately fall; 
being knocked down, I suppose with a elub or

  and ‘unbound, Nature inspired him with hopes of 
life andi he started away from~them, and ran 
with ineredible swiftness along the.sands, directly 
toward me; I mean toward that part of the coast 
. Where my habitation was. I was dréadfully 
_ frightened, that I must acknowledge, when I 
perceived him run my way; and especially when, 
‘as I. thought, I saw him pursued by the whole 
‘body; and now I expected that part of my dream 
was coming to pass, and that he would certainly 
take shelter in my grove; but I could not depend, 
by any means, upon my dream, that the other 
savages would not pursue him thither, and find 
him there. However, I kept my station, and 
my spirits began to recover when I found that 
there was not above three men that followed him; 
and still more was encouraged, when I found that 
he outstript them exceedingly im running, and 
gained ground on them; so that, if he could but 
hold it for half an hour, I saw easily he would 
fairly get away from them all. 
There was, between them and my castle, the 
ereek, which I mentioned often in the first part 
of my story, where I Janded my cargoes out of 
the ship; and this I saw plainly he must neces- 
sarily swim over, or the poor wretch would be 
‘taken there; but when the savage escaping came 
thither, he made nothing of it, tho the tide was 
then up; but, plunging in, swam through in about 
thirty strokes, or thereabouts, landed and ran 
with exceeding strength and swiftness. When 
the three persons eame to the ereek I found 
that two of them could swim,. but the third could 
not, and that, standing on the other side, he 
looked at the others, but went no farther, and 
206

  soon after went softly back again; which, as it 
happened, was very well for him in the end. 
I observed that the two who swam were yet 
more than twice as long swimming over the creek 
than the fellow was that fled from them. It came 
very warmly upon my thoughts, and indeed ir- 
resistibly, that now was the time to get me a 
servant, and perhaps a companion or ‘assistant; 
and that I was plainly called by Providence to 
save this poor ecreature’s life. I immediately 
ran down the ladder with all possible expedition, 
fetched my two guns, for they were both at the 
foot of the ladder, as I observed before, and 
getting up again with the same haste to the top 
of the hill, 1 crost toward the sea; and having 
a very short cut, and all down hill, clap’d myself - 
in the way between the pursuers and the pur- 
sued, hallooing aloud to him that fled, who, 
looking back, was at first perhaps as much fright- 
ened at me as at them; but I beckoned with my 
hand to him to come back; and, in the mean time, 
I slowly advanced toward the two that followed ; 
then rushing at once upon the foremost, I 
Knocked him down with the stock of my piece. . 
I was Toath to fire, because I would not have the 
rest hear; tho at that distance it would not have 
been easily heard, and being out of sight of 
the smoke, too, they would not have known what 
to make of it. Having knocked this fellow dewn, 
the other who pursued him stopt, as if he had 
been frightened, and I advanced. toward him; 
but as I came nearer, I perceived presently he 
had a bow and arrow, and was fitting it to shoot 
at me; so I was then obliged to -sheot at him 
first, which I did, and killed him at the first .

shot. The poor savage who fled, but had stopt, 
tho he ‘saw both his enemies fallen and killed, 
ashe thought, yet was so frightened with the 
fire.and noise of my piece that he stood stock 
still, and neither came forward nor went back- 
‘ward, tho he seemed rather inclined still to fly 
‘than to come on. I hallooed again to him, and 
made signs to come forward, which he easily 
understood, and came a little way; then stopt 
again, and then a little farther, and stopt again; 
and I could then perceive that he stood trem- 
pling, as if he had been taken prisoner, and had 
just been to be killed, as his two enemies were. 
I beckoned to him again to come to me, and 
gave him all the signs of encouragement that I 
could think of; and he came nearer and nearer, 
kneeling down every ten or twelve steps, in token 
of acknowledgment for saving his life. I smiled 
at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to 
him to come still nearer; at length, he came close 
to me; and then he kneeled down again, kissed 
the ground, and laid his head upon the ground, 
and, taking me by the foot, set my foot upon his 
head;, this, it seems, was in token of swearing 
to be my slave forever. I took him up, and 
made much of him, and encouraged him all I 
could. - 
.. But there was more work to do yet; for I 
pereeived the savage whom I had knocked down 
was not killed, but stunned with the. blow, and 
began to come to himself. So I pointed to him, 
and. showed him the savage, that he was not 
dead; ‘upon this he spoke some words to me, and 
tho I eceuld not understand them, yet I thought 
they were pleasant to hear; for. they were the

first sound of a man’s voice that I had heard, 
my own excepted, for above twenty-five years. ~ 
But there was no time for such reflections now}; 
the savage who was knocked down recovered him-. 
self so far as to sit up upon the ground, and. 
I perceived that my savage began to be afraid. 
but when I saw that, I presented my other piece: 
at the man, as if I would shoot him;.upon this. 
my savage, for so I call him now, made’a motion 
to me to lend him my sword, which hung naked 
in a belt by my side, which I did. He no sooner’ 
had it, but he runs to his enemy, and at one 
blow cut off his head as cleverly, no executioner- 
in Germany could have done it. sooner or better; 
which I thought very strange for one who, I had. 
reason to believe, never saw a sword in his life 
before, except their own wooden swords: how- 
ever, it seems, as learned afterwards, they make. 
their wooden swords so sharp, so heavy, and the: © 
wood is so hard, that they will even cut off heads: 
with them, ay, and arms, and that. at one blow 
too. When he had done this, he comes laughiug- 
to me in sign of triumph, and brought me the: 
sword again, and with sbundance of gestures. 
which I did not understand, laid it down, with 
the head of ihe savage that he had killed just 
before me. But that which astonished him most, 
was to know how I killed the other Indian so: 
far off; so pointing to him, he made signs to me: 
to let him go to him; and I bade him go, as well 
as I could. When he came to him, he stood like- 
one amazed, looking at him, turning him first. 
on one side, then on the other; looked at the: 
wound the bullet had made, which it seems was: 
just im his breast, where it had made a hole, andi

no great-‘quantity of blood had followed; but 
he had'.bled inwardly, for he was quite dead. 
‘Upon this he made signs to me that he should 
‘bury ‘them with sand, that they might not be 
_ seen by the rest, if they followed; and so I made 
‘signs to him again to do so. He fell to work; 
| send in an instant he had seraped a hole in the 
- sand with his hands, big enough to bury the first 
in, and then dragged him into it, and covered 
‘him; and did so by the other also; I believe he 
had buried them both in a quarter of an hour. 
Then calling him away, I carried him, not to 
my castle, but quite away to my cave, on the 
farther part of the island; so I did not let my 
dream come to pass in that part, that he came 
into my grove for shelter. Here I gave him 
. bread and a bunch of raisins to eat, and a draft 
‘of water, which I found he was indeed in great 
. distress for from his running; and having re- 
freshed him, I made signs for him to go and 
lie down to sleep, showing him a place where 
T had laid some rice straw, and a blanket upon 
it, which I used to sleep upon myself sometimes ; 
so the poor creature lay down, and went to sleep.

IN THE TIME OF THE GREAT PLAGUE* 
A Buazine star or comet appeared for several 
months before the plague, as there did the year 
after, another, a little before the fire; the old 
women, and the phlegmatie hypochondriac’ part 
of the other sex, whom I could almost call the 
old women too, remarked, especially afterward, 
tho not till both those judgments were over, that 
those two comets passed directly over the city, 
and that so very near the houses that it was 
plain they imported something peculiar to the 
city alone. That the comet before the pestilence 
was of a faint, dull, languid color, and its motion 
very heavy, solemn, and slow; but that the comet 
before the fire was bright and sparkling, or as 
others said, flaming, and its motion swift and 
furious; and that accordingly one foretold a — 
heavy judgment, slow but severe, terrible, and 
frightful, as was the plague. But the other fore-- 
told a stroke, sudden, swift, and fiery, as was the 
conflagration; nay, so particular some. people 
were, that as they looked upon that comet. pre- 
ceding the fire they fancied that they not only 
saw it pass swiftly and fiereely, and eould per- 
ceive the motion with their eye, but they even 
heard it—that it made a rushing mighty noise, 
fierce and terrible, tho at a distanee and but 
just perceivable.

The year of the plague was 1665.

The shutting up of houses was at first counted 
a very cruel and unchristian method, and the 
poor people so confined made bitter lamenta- 
. tions; complainis of the severity of it were also 
daily brought to my lord mayor, of houses cause- 
i ly and some maliciously shut up; I can not 
o-say, but upon inquiry, many that complained so 
loudly were found in a condition to be continued; 
‘and others again, inspection being made upon 
‘the sick person and the sickness not appearing 
infectious, or if uncertain, yet on his being con- 
tent to be carried to the pest-house, was released. 
As I went along Houndsditch one morning 
about eight o’clock there-was a great noise; it 
. is true indeed that there was not much erowd, 
because the people were not free to gather to- 
gether, or to stay together when they were there, 
-nor did I stay long there; but the outery was 
_Joud enough to prompt my curiosity, and I ealled 
to one who looked out of a window, and asked 
what was the matter. 
A watehman, it seems, had been employed to 
keep his post at the door of a house which was 
infected, or said to be infected, and was shut 
up; he had been there all night for two-nights 
together, as he told his story, and the day watch- 
man had been there one day, and was now come 
to relieve him; all this while no noise had been 
heard in the house, no light had been seen, they 
called for nothing, sent him on no errands, which 
used to be the chief business of the watchman, 
neither had they given him any disturbance, as 
_ he said from Monday afternoon, when he heard 
a great erying and screaming in the house, which 
as he supposed was occasioned by some of the 
212
-P-A-G-E-216
  DANIEL DEFOE 
  family dying just at that time. It seems the 
night before, the dead-cart, as it was called, had 
been stopt there, and a servant-maid had been 
brought down to the door dead, and the buriers 
or bearers, as they were called, put her into the 
cart, wrapt only in a green rug, and carried her 
away. 
The watchman had knocked at the door, it 
seems, when he heard that noise and erying as 
above, and nobody answered a great while; but 
at last one looked out and said with an angry 
quick tone, and yet a kind of erying voice, or 
a voice of one that was erying, ‘‘What d’ye 
want, that you make such a knocking?’’? He 
answered, ‘‘I am the watchman; how do you do? 
What is the matter?’’ The person answered, 
‘¢What is that to you? Stop the dead-cart.’’ 
This, it seems, was about one o’clock; soon after, 
as the fellow said, he stopt the dead-eart, and 
then knocked: again, but nobody answered; he 
eontinued knocking, and the bellman. called out 
several times, ‘‘Bring out your dead’’; but no~ 
body answered, till the-man that drove the cart,. 
being called to other houses, would stay no 
longer, and drove away. : 
The watchman knew not what to make of all 
this, so he let them alone till the morning man, 
or day watchman, as they called him, came to 
relieve him. Giving him an account of the par- 
ticulars, they knocked at the door a great while, 
but nobody answered, and they observed that — 
the window or casement at which the person 
looked out who had answered before, continued. 
open, being up two pair of stairs. 
Upon this the two men, to satisfy. their euri-

  osity,' got a long ladder, and one of them went 
up'to.the window and looked into the room, 
where'he saw a woman lying dead upon the floor 
in’a@ dismal manner, having no clothes on but 
her shift; but tho he called aloud, and putting 
din‘ his’ long staff, knocked hard on the floor, yet 
nobody stirred or answered; neither could he 
hear any noise in the house. 
He came down upon this and acquainted his 
‘fellow, who went up also, and finding it just 
so, they resolved to acquaint either the lord 
mayor or some other magistrate of it, but did 
not offer to go in at the window. The magis- 
trate, it seems, upon the information of the two 
men ordered the house to be broken open, a con- 
stable and other persons being appointed to be 
--present, that nothing might be plundered; and 
accordingly it was so done, when nobody was 
‘found in the house but that young woman, who 
having been infected and past recovery, the rest 
‘had left her to die by herself, and every one 
gone, having found some way to delude the 
watchman and to get open the door, or get out 
at some back door, or over the tops of the houses, 
so that he knew nothing of it; and as to those 
eries and shrieks which he heard, it was sup- 
posed they were the passionate cries of the fam- 
ily at this bitter parting, which to be sure it 
was to them all, this being the sister to the mis- 
tress of the family. The man of the house, his 
wife, several children and servants, being all 
gone and fled; whether sick or sound, that I 
could never learn, nor indeed did I make much 
inquiry after it. . 2...

prodigious number of itself; but if I should add 
the reasons which I have to believe that this. 
account was deficient, and how'deficient it was, 
you would with me make no seruple to believe 
that there died above 10,000 a week for all those 
weeks, and a proportion for several weeks both 
before and after. The confusion among the peo- 
ple, especially within the city, at that time was 
inexpressible; the terror was so great at last 
that the courage of the people appointed to carry 
away the dead began to fail them; nay, several 
of them died, altho they had the distemper be- 
fore, and were recovered; and some of-them had 
dropt down when they had been carrying the 
bodies even at the pitside, and just ready to 
throw them in; and this confusion was greater in 
the city, because they had flattered themselves 
with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitter- 
ness of death was past. One cart, they told 
us, going up te Shoreditch, was forsaken by the 
drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he 
died in the street; and the horses, going on, 
overthrew the cart and left the bodies, some 
thrown here, some there, is a dismal manner. 
Another eart was, it seems, found in the great 
pit in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead, 
or having been gone and abandoned it; and the 
horses running too near it, the cart fell in and 
drew the horses in also. It was suggested that 
the driver was thrown in with it and that the 
eart fell upon him, by reason his whip was seen 
to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I 
suppose, could not be certain. .

I was received very kindly by the warden, and 
cwent for many days to the academy. Every room 
hath in it one or more projectors, and I believe 
I could not be in fewer than five hundred rooms. 
“The first man I saw was of a meager aspect, 
with sooty hands and face, his hair and beard 
long, ragged, and singed in several places. His 
clothes, shirt, and skin were all of the same color. 
He had been eight years upon a project for ex- 
tracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were 
‘to be put into phials hermetically sealed, and let 
out to warm the air in raw inclement summers. 
‘He told me he did not doubt in eight years more 
that he should be able to supply the governor’s 
‘gardens with sunshine at a reasonable rate; 
but’ he complained that his stock was iow,

  and entreated me to give him something 
as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially 
since this had been a very-dear season for 
cucumbers. I made him a smali present, for my 
Jord had furnished me with money on purpose, 
because he-knew their practise of begging from 
all who go to see them. 
I saw another at work to caleine ice into gun- 
powder, who likewise shewed me: a treatise he 
had written concerning the malleability of fire, 
which he intended to publish. 
There was a most ingenious architect, who, 
had contrived a new method for building houses, 
by beginning at the roof, and working downwards 
to the foundation; which he justified to me. by 
the like practise of those two prudent insects, 
the bee and the spider. 
There was an astronomer who had undertaken 
to place a sun-dial upon the great weather-cock 
on the town-house, by adjusting the annual. and 
diurnal motions of the earth and sun, so as to 
answer and coincide with all accidental turning 
of the winds. 
We crossed a walk to the other pari of. the 
academy, where, as I have already said, the pro- 
jectors in speculative learning resided. 
The first professor I saw was in a very large 
room, with forty pupils about him. After saluta- 
tion, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame 
whieh tock up the greatest part of both the 
length and breadth of the room, he said, perhaps 
I might wonder to see him employed in a project 
for improving speculative knowledge by practical 
and mechanical operations. But the world would 
soon be sensible of its usefulness, and he flattered 
217
-P-A-G-E-221
een 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  himself that a more noble, exalted thought never 
’ gprang’ in any other. man’s head. Every one 
knew how laborious the usual method is of at- 
taining to arts and sciences; whereas by his con- 
trivanee, the most ignorant person, at a rea- 
sonable eharge, and with alittle bodily labor, 
amay write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, 
law, mathematies, and theology, without the least 
"assistance from genius or study. He then led 
‘me'to the frame, about the sides whereof all his 
pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet square, 
“placed in the middle of the room. The super- 
‘ficies was composed of several bits of wood, about 
the bigness of a die, but some larger than others. 
They were all linked together by slender wires. 
These bits of wood were covered on every square 
with paper pasted on them; and on these papers 
were written all the words of their language in 
their several moods, tenses, ‘and declensions, but 
‘without. any order. The professor then desired 
me to observe, for he was going to set his engine 
at work. The pupils, at his command, took each 
of them hold of an iron handle, whereof there 
were forty fixt round the edges of the frame, 
and giving them a sudden turn, the whole dis- 
position of the words was entirely changed. He 
then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads to 
read the several lines softly as they appeared 
upon the frame; and where they found three or 
four words together that might make part of a 
sentence, they dictated to the four remaining 
boys, who were scribes. This work was repeated 
three or four times, and at every turn the engine 
was so contrived that the words shifted into new 
places as the square bits of wood moved upside 
218 ‘

  down. Six hours a day the young students were 
employed in this labor; and the professor shewed 
me several volumes in large folio, already col- 
lected of broken sentences, which he intended to 
piece together, and out of those rich materials 
give the world a complete body of all arts and 
sciences. 
We next went to the school of languages, where 
three professors sat in consultation upon im- 
proving ‘that of their own country. 
The first project was to shorten discourse by 
cutting polysyllables into one, and leaving out 
verbs and participles; because, in. reality, all 
things imaginable are but nouns. The other was 
a scheme for entirely abolishing all words what- 
soever; and this was urged as a great advantage 
in point of health as well as brevity; for, it is 
plain that every word we speak is in some degree 
a diminution of our lungs by corrosion, and con- 
sequently contributes to the shortening of our . 
lives. An expedient was therefore offered, that 
since words are only names for things, it would 
be more convenient for all men to carry about 
them such things as were necessary to express 
the particular business they are to discourse on. 
And this invention would certainly have taken 
place, to the great ease as well’as health. of the 
subject, if the women, in conjunetion with the 
vulgar and illiterate, had not threatened to raise 
a rebellion, unless they might be allowed the 
liberty to speak with their tongues, after ‘the ~ 
manner of their forefathers; such constant: ir- 
reconcilable enemies to science are the common 
people. 
Another great advantage proposed by this in- 
219
-P-A-G-E-223
    “THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  vention was, that it would serve as a universal 
language ‘to. be understood in all eivilized na- 
tions,whose goods and utensils are generally of 
the-same kind, or nearly resembling, so that their 
might easily be comprehended. And thus 
ambassadors would be qualified to treat with 
‘foreign princes or ministers of state, to whose 
tongues they were utter strangers. 
\.-¥ was at the mathematical school, where the 
master taught his pupils after a method scarce 
imaginable to us in Europe. The proposition 
and demonstration were fairly written on a thin 
wafer, with ink composed of a cephalic tincture. 
This. the student was to swallow upon a fasting 
stomach, and for three days following eat noth- 
ing but bread and water. As the wafer digested, 
the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing the 
proposition along with it. But the success hath 
not hitherto been answerable, partly by some 
verror in the quantum or composition, and partly 
by ‘the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus 
is so nauseous that they generally steal aside, 
and discharge it upward before it can operate; 
neither have they been yet persuaded to use so 
long. an abstinence as the preseription: requires. 
- In the school of political projectors I was but 
sill entertained, the professors appearing in my 
judgment wholly out of their senses, which is a 
scene that never fails to make me melancholy. 
These unhappy people were proposing schemes 
for persuading monarehs to choose favorites upon 
the seore of their wisdom, capacity and virtue; 
of teaching ministers, to consult the publie good;_ 
of rewarding merit, great abilities, and eminent 
services; of instructing princes to know their

  _ trne interest, by placing it on the same founda-~ 
tion with that of their people; of choosing for 
employments persons qualified to exercise them; . 
with many other wild impossible chimeras that 
never entered before into the heart of man to 
eonceive, and confirmed in me the old observa-

THoss inferior duties of life which the French 
eall les petites morales, or the smaller morals, 
are with us distinguished by the name of good 
manners or breeding. This I look upon, in the 
general notion of it, to be a sort of artificial 
good sense, adapted to the meanest capacities, 
and introduced to make mankind easy in their 
commerce with each other. Low and little under- 
standings, without some rules of this kind, would 
be perpetually wandering into a thousand in- 
decencies and irregularities in behavior; and. in 
their ordinary conversation, fall into the same 
boisterous familiarities that one observeth 
amongst them when a debauch hath quite taken 
away the use of their reason. In other instances, 
it is odd to consider, that for want of common 
discretion, the very end of good breeding is.

from my cousin. As soon as I entered the parlor, 
they put me into the great chair that stood close

I was almost stifled. Then a boy. came in 
great hurry to pull off my boots, which I in vain 
opposed, urging that I must retura soon after

her hand. The girl returned instantly with a 
beer-glass half full of agua mirabilis and syrup 
of gillyflowers. I took as.much as I had a mind 
for; but madam vowed I should drink it off— 
for she was sure it would do me good, after 
coming out of the cold air—and I was forced to 
obey; which absolutely took away my stomach. 
‘When dinner came in, I had a mind to sit at 
a distance from the fire; but they told me it was 
as much as my life was worth, and set me with 
my back just against it. Altho my appetite was 
quite gone, I resolved to force down as much 
as I could; and desired the leg of a pullet. ‘‘In- 
deed, Mr. Bickerstaff,’’ says the lady, ‘‘you 
must eat a wing to oblige me’’; and so put a 
couple upon my plate. I was persecuted at this 
rate during the whole meal. As often as I called 
for small beer, the master tipped the wink, and 
the servant brought me a brimmer of October. 
Some time after dinner, I ordered my cousin’s

  man, who came with me, to get ready the horses, 
but it was resolved ¥ should not stir that night; 
and when I seemed pretty much bent upon going, 
they ordered the stable door to be locked; and 
the children hid my cloak and! boots. The next 
question was, what I would have for supper. I 
said I never ate anything at night; but was at 
last, in my own defense, obliged to name the 
first thing that came into my head. After three 
hours spent chiefly:in apologies for my enter- 
tainment, insinuating to me, ‘‘that this was the 
worst time of the year for provisions; that they 
were at a great distance from any market; that 
they were afraid I should be starved; and that 
they knew they kept me to my loss,’’ the lady 
went and left me to her husband—for they took 
special care I should never be alone. As soon 
as her back was turned, the little misses ran 
backward and forward every moment; and con- 
stantly as they came in or went out, made a 
courtesy directly at me, which in good manners 
I was forced to return with a bow, and, ‘‘ Your 
humble servant, pretty miss.’? Exactly at eight 
the mother came up, and discovered by the red- 
ness of her face that supper was not far off. 
It was twice as large as the dinner, and my per- 
secution doubled in proportion. I desired at my 
usual hour to go to my repose, and was conducted 
to my chamber by the gentleman, his lady, and 
the whole train of children. They importuned 
me to drink something before I went to bed; 
and upon my refusing, at last left a bottle of 
stingo, as they called it, for fear I should wake 
and be thirsty in the night. I was forced ‘in 
the morning to rise and dress myself. in the

‘would needs see me part of my way, and carry 
mee a short-cut through his own grounds, which

last. piece of civility had like to have cost me

by leaping over his ditches, and at last forced 
to alight in the ditt; when my horse, having 
slipt his bridle, ran away and took us up more 
than an hour to. recover him again. It is evident 
that none of the absurdities I met with in this

THE ART OF LYING IN POLITICS? 
‘TI at prevailed on, through the importunity ef 
-friends, to interrupt the scheme I had begun in 
my last paper, by an essay upon the Art of 
Political Lying. We are told the devil is the 
father of lies, and was.a liar from the beginning; 
so that, beyond contradiction, the invention is

  old: and, which is more, his first. essay of it was 
purely political, employed in undermining the 
authority of his prince, and seducing a third 
part of the subjects from their. obedience: for 
which he was driven down from heaven, where 
(as Milton expresses it) he had been viceroy of 
@ great western province; and foreed to exercise 
his talent in inferior regions among other fallen 
spirits, poor or deluded men, whom he still daily 
tempis to his own sin, and will ever do. so, til} 
he be chained in the bottomless pit. 
But altho the devil be the father of lies, he 
seems, like other great inventors, to have lost 
much of his reputation, by the continual im- 
provements that have been made upon him. 
Who first reduced lying into an art, and 
adapted it to polities, is not so clear from his- 
tory, altho I have made some diligent. inquiries. 
I shall therefore consider it only according to 
the modern system, as it has been cultivated 
these twenty years past in the southern part of 
our own island. , 
The poets tell us, that after the giants were 
overthrown by the gods, the earth in revenge 
produced her last offspring, which was Fame. 
And the fable is thus interpreted: that when 
tumults and seditions are quieted, rumors and 
false reports are plentifully spread through a 
nation. So that, by this account, lying is. the 
last relief of a routed, earth-born, rebellious 
party in a state. But here the Moderns have 
made great additions, applying this art to the 
gaining of power and preserving it, as well as 
revenging themselves after they have lost it; 
as the same instruments are made use of by

  animals to feed themselves when they are hungry, 
and te bite those that tread upon them. 
But. the same genealogy can not always be 
admitted for political lying; I shall therefore 
desire to refine upon it, by adding some circum- 
stances of its birth and parents. A. political lie 
- 48 sometimes born out of a discarded statesman’s 
head, and thence delivered. to be nursed and 
‘dandled by the rabble. Sometimes it is pro- 
duced a monster, and licked into shape; at other 
times it comes into the world completely formed, 
and is spoiled in the. licking. It is often born 
an infant in the regular way, and requires time 
to mature it; and often it sees the light in its 
full growth, but. dwindles away by degrees. 
Sometimes it is of noble birth; and sometimes 
the spawn of a stoekjobber. Here it sereams 
aloud at the opening of the womb; and there it 
is delivered with .2 whisper... I know a lie that 
‘now disturbs half the Kingdom with its noise, 
which, altho too proud and great at present to 
own its parents, I can remember its whisperhood. 
To conclude the nativity of this monster; when 
it comes into the world without a sting, it is 
stillborn; and whenever it loses its sting, it dies. 
. No wonder if an infant so miraculous in its 
birth should be destined -for great adventures; 
and accordingly we see it hath been the guardian 
spirit of a prevailing party for almost twenty 
years. It can conquer kingdoms without fighting, 
and sometimes with the loss of a battle. It gives 
and resumes employments; can sink a mountain 
to a molehill, and raise a molehill to a mountain; 
hath presided for many years at committees of

This goddess flies with a huge looking-glass in 
her hands, to dazzle the crowd, ‘and make them 
see, according as she turns it, theis: xuin in their 
interest, and their interest in their ruin. In 
this glass you will behold your best friends, 
clad in coats powdered with fleurs-de-lis, and 
triple crowns; their girdles hung round’ with 
chains, and beads, and wooden shoes; and your 
worst enemies adored with the ensigns of lib- 
erty, property, indulgence, moderation, and a 
cornucopia in their hands. Her large wings, like 
those of a flying fish, are of no use but while they 
are moist; she therefore dips them in mud, and 
soaring aloft seatters it in the eyes of the multi- 
tude, flying with great swiftness; but at every 
turn is foreed to stoop in dirty ways for new 
supplies. 
I have been sometimes thinking, if a man ‘had

they have in Seotland for seeing spirits, how 
admirably he might entertain himself in this

A MEDITATION UPON A BROOMSTICK‘ 
“Tats single stick, which yon now behold in- 
gloriously lying in that neglected eorner, I once 
knew in a flourishing state in a forest. It was 
full of sap, full of leaves, and full of boughs; 
but now in vain does the busy art of man pre- 
tend io vie with nature, by tying that withered 
bundle of twigs to its sapless trunk; it is now 
at best but the reverse of what it. was, a tree 
turned upside down, the branches on the earth, 
and the root in the air; it is now handled by 
every dirty wench, condemned to do her drudg- 
ery, and, by a capricious kind of fate, destined 
to make other things elean, and be nasty itself; 
.at length, worn to the stumps in the service of 
the maids, it is either thrown out-of-doors, or 
condemned to the last use of kindling a fire. 
When I beheld this I sighed, and said within 
myself, ‘‘Surely mortal man is a broomstick!’’ 
Nature sent him into the world strong and lusty, 
in a thriving condition, wearing his own hair 
on his head, the proper branches of this rea- 
soning vegetable, till the ax of intemperance 
has lopped off his green boughs, and left him a 
withered trunk; he then flies to art, and puts on 
@ periwig, valuing himself upon an unnatural 
bundle of hairs, all covered with powder, that 
never grew on his head; but now should this 
our broomstick pretend to enter the scene, proud

finest lady’s chamber, we should be apt to rid- 
ieule and despise its vanity. Partial judges that 
we are of our own excellences, and, other men’s 
defaults! mo . . 
But a broomstick, perhaps you will say, is an 
emblem of a tree standing on its héad;'and pray 
what is a man but a topsy-turvy creature, his 
animal faculties perpetually mounted on his’ ra- 
tional, his head where his heels should be, grovel- 
ing on the earth? And yet, with all his faults, 
he sets up to be a universal reformer and cor- 
rector of abuses, a remover of grievances; rakes. 
into every slut’s corner of nature, bringing hid- 
den corruptions to the light; and raises a mighty 
dust where there was none before, sharing deeply 
all the while in the very same pollutions he 
pretends to sweep away. His last days are spent 
in slavery to women, and generally the least 
deserving; till, worn to the stumps, like his 
brother besom, he is either kicked out-of-doors, 
or made use of to kindle flames for others to 
warm themselves by.

" ©.GULLIVER AMONG THE GIANTS‘ 
My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, 
. a child of towardly parts for her age, very dex- 
terous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her 
baby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up 
-:.- the baby’s cradle for me against night; the 
cradle was put into a small drawer of a eabinet, 
and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for 
fear of the rats. This was my bed all the time 
I stayed. with those people; tho made more con- 
venient by degrees, as I began to learn their 
language and make my wants known. This 
young girl was so handy, that after I had once 
or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she 
was able to dress and: undress me; tho I never 
‘gave her that trouble when she would let me do 
-either myself. She made me seven shirts, and 
some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be 
got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; 
and these she constantly washed for me with 
her own hands. She was likewige my school- 
mistress, to teach me the language: when I 
pointed to anything, she told me the name of 
it in-her own tongue; so that in a few days I 
was able to call for whatever I had a mind to. 
She was very good-natured, and not above forty 
5¥rom “Gulliver's Travels.” At this point in the story 
Gulliver, shipwrecked in the country of Brobdingnag, had 
by the farmer who found him been given as a plaything 
to his little daughter Giumdalclitch, who, altho only -nine 
years old, was forty feet tall.

  feet high, being little for her age. She: gave 
me the name of Grildrig, which the family took ° 
up, and afterwards the whole kingdom. The 
word imports what the Latins eall homunculus,’ 
the Italians homunceletino, and the English man- 
nikin. To her I chiefly owe my ‘preservation in 
that country; we never parted while I was there: 
I called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse; 
and should be guilty of great ingratitude if I 
omitted this honorable mention of her care and 
affection toward me, which I heartily wish. it 
lay in my power to requite as she deserves, in- 
stead of being the innocent but unhappy instru- 
ment of her disgrace, as I have too much reason 
to fear. 
It now began to be known and talked of in 
the neighborhood that my master had found a 
strange animal in the field, about the bigness 
of a splacnuck, but exactly shaped in every part 
like a human creature, which it likewise imitated 
in all its actions: seemed to speak. in: a little 
language of its. own, had already learned several 
words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was 
tame and gentle, would come when it was called, 
do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in 
the world, and a complexion fairer than a noble- 
man’s daughter of three years old. 
Another farmer who lived ‘hard by, and was a 
particular friend of my master, came on a Visit 
on purpose to inquire into the ‘truth of this 
story. I was immediately produced and placed 
upon a table, where I walked as I-was com- 
manded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made 
my reverence to my master’s guest, asked him 
in his own language how he did,-and told him

he was weleome—just as my little nurse had in- 
ume. This man who was old and dim- 
ut. on his spectacles to behold me bet-

‘or his eyes appeared like the full moon

ho discovered the cause of my mirth, 
company in laughing; at which the old 
's fool enough to be angry and out of 
eountenance. He had. the character of a great 
miser; and to my misfortune, he well: deserved 
it, by the cursed advice he gave my master to 
show me as a sight upon a market-day in the 
next town, which was. half an hour’s riding, 
about two-and-twenty miles from our house. I 
guessed there was some mischief contriving when 
T observed my master and his friend whispering 
long together, sometimes pointing at me; and 
amy.fears made me fancy that I overheard and 
- anderstood some of their words. 
. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little 
nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had 
eunningly picked out from her mother. The poor 
girl laid me on her bosom, and fell a-weeping 
with shame and grief. She apprehended some 
mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar 
folks, who: might squeeze me to death, or break 
one of my limbs by taking me in their hands. 
She had also observed how modest I was in my 
mature, how nicely I regarded my honor, and 
what an indignity I-should conceive it to be 
exposed for money as a publie spectacle to the 
meanest. of the people. She said her papa and 
mama. had promised that Grildrig should be 
hers; but now she found they meant to serve

her as they did last year, when they pretended 
to give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was 
fat, sold it to a batcher. For my own part, I 
may truly affirm that I was less: concerned than 
my nurse. I had a strong hope, which never 
left me, that.I should one day recover my lib- 
erty: and as to the ignominy of being carried 
about for a. monster, I considered myself to be 
a perfect stranger in the country, and that such 
a misfortune eould never be charged upon me 
‘as a reproach if ever I should return to England, 
since the King of Great Britain himself, in my 
condition, must have undergone the same distress. 
My master, pursuant to the advice of his 
friend, carried me in a box the next market-day 
to the neighboring town, and took along with. 
him his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion 
behind him. The box was close on every side, 
with a little door fer me to go in and out, and 
a few gimlet-holes to let in air. The girl had 
been so careful as to put the quilt of her baby’s 
bed into it for me to lie down on. However, I 
was terribly shaken and discomposed in. this 
journey, tho it were but of half an hour; for 
the horse went about forty feet at every step, 
and trotted so high that the agitation was equal 
to the rising and falling of a ship in a great 
storm, but much more frequent. Our journey 
was somewhat farther than from London to St. 
Alban’s, My master. alighted at an inn which 
he used to frequent; and after consulting a while 
with the innkeeper, and making some necessary 
preparations, he hired the ‘‘grultrud,’’ or erier,

a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a 
time to see me.. I walked about on the table 
as the girl commanded; she asked me questions 
as far as.she knew my understanding of the lan- 
guage reached, and I answered them as loud as 
I could. I turned about several times to the 
company, paid my humble respeets, said ‘‘they 
were welcome,’’ and used some other speeches

swith liquor, which Glumdalelitch had given me 
for a cup, and drank their health. I drew out 
my hanger, and flourished with it after the man- 
ner of fencers in England. My nurse gave me a 
part. of a straw, which I exercised as a pike, 
having learned the art in my youth. I was that 
day shown to twelve sets of company, and as 
often forced to act over again the same fop- 
peries, till I was half.dead with weariness and 
vexation; for those who had seen me made such 
wonderful reports that the. people were ready 
to break down the doors to come in. My master,

to touch me except my nurse; and to. prevent

My master’s design was to show me in all.

above seven or eight score miles a day; for 
Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, com- 
plained she was tired with the trotting of the 
horse. She often took me out of my box, at my 
own desire, to give me air and show me the 
country; but always held me fast by a leading- 
string. We passed over five or six rivers, many 
degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the 
Ganges; and there was hardly a rivulet so small 
as the Thames at London Bridge. We were ten

The life of these men is finely described in 
Holy Writ by ‘‘the path of an arrow,’’ which is 
immediately closed up and lost. 
Upon my going into the church, I entertained 
myself with the digging of a grave; and saw, 
in every shovelful of it that was thrown up, 
the fragment of a bone or skull intermixt with 
a kind of fresh moldering earth that some time 
‘or other had a place in the composition of a 
human body. Upon this I began to consider 
with myself, what innumerable multitudes of 
people lay confused together under the pavement _ 
of that ancient cathedral; how men and women, 
friends and enemies, priests and soldiers, monks 
and prebendaries, were crumbled amongst one 
another, and blended together in the same com- 
mon mass; how beauty, strength and youth, with 
old age, weakness, and deformity, lay undistin- 
guished in the same promiscuous heap of matter.

‘and by that means are not understood once in

there were’ poets who had no monuments, and 
monuments which had no poets. I observed, 
indeed, that the present. war had filled the church 
with many. of these uninhabited monuments, 
which had been erected to the memory of per- 
sobs whose bodies were perhaps buried in the 
“plains of Blenheim, or in the bosom of the ocean. 
» I eould not but be very much delighted with 
several modern epitaphs, which are written with

of state. The inscription is answerable te the 
monument; for instead of celebrating the many 
remarkable actions he had performed in the serv- 
iee of his country, it acquaints us only with the 
manner. of his death, in which it was impossible 
for him.to reap any honor. The Dutch, whom we 
are apt to despise for want of genius, show an 
infinitely greater taste of antiquity and polite- 
ness in their buildings and works of this nature, 
than what we meet with in those of our own

with rostral crowns and naval ornaments, with 
beautiful festoons of seaweed, shells, and coral. 
But to return to our subject. I have left the 
repository of our English kings for the con- 
templation of another day, when I shall find 
my mind disposed for so serious an amusement. 
I know that entertainments of this nature are 
apt to raise dark and dismal thoughts in tim- 
orous minds and gloomy imaginations: but for 
my own part, tho I am always serious, I do not 
know what it is to be melancholy; and can there- 
fore take a view of nature in her deep and 
solemn scenes, with the same pleasure as in her 
most gay and delightful ones. By this means, 
I ean improve myself with those objects which 
others consider with terror. When J look upon 
the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy 
dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the 
beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when. 
I meet with the grief of parents upon a tomb- 
stone, my heart melts with compassion; when

On the little competitions, factions, and debates

WILL HONEYCOMB AND HIS MARRIAGE* 
' My friend Will Honeycomb values himself 
very much: upon what he calls the knowledge 
of mankind, which has cost him many disasters 
in his youth; for Will reckons every misfortune 
that he has met with among the women, and 
every encounter among the men, as parts of his 
education, and fancies he should never have been 
the man he is, had he not broke windows, knocked 
down constables, disturbed ‘honest people with 
his midnight serenades, and. beat up Phryne’s 
quarters, when he was a young fellow. The 
engaging in adventures of this nature, Will calls 
the studying of mankind, and terms this knowl-

  edge of the town, the knowledge of the world. 
‘Will ingenuously confesses, that for half his life 
his head ached every morning with reading of 
men over night; and at presest comforts himself 
under sundry infirmities with the reflection that. 
without them he could not have. been acquainted 
with the gallantries of the age.. This ‘Will looks. 
upon as the learning of a gentleman, and regards 
all other kinds of science as the accomplishments 
of one whom he calls a scholar, a bookish man, 
or a philosopher. . an 
For these reasons Will shines in a mixed com- 
pany, where he has the discretion not. to go out. 
of his depth, and has often a certain way of: 
making his real ignorance appear a seeming one. 
Our club, however, has frequently caught him. 
tripping, at which times they never spare him. 
For as Will often insults us with the knowledge. 
of the town, we sometimes take our revenge 
upon him by our knowledge of books. 
He was last week producing two or three let- 
ters which he writ in his youth to a eoquette: 
lady. The raillery of them was natural, and’ 
well enough for a mere man of the town; but 
very unluckily, several of the words were wrong 
spelt. Will laughed this off at first as well as. 
he could; but finding himself pushed on all sides, 
and especially by the Templar, he told us with a. 
little passion that he never likéd pedantry in 
spelling, and that he spelt like a gentleman and 
not like a sebolar: upon this Will had recourse: 
to his old topie of showing the narrow-spirited- 
ness, the pride and ignorance, of pedants; which 
ke carried so far, that, upon my retiring to my 
lodgings, I could not forbear throwing together 
I—ié . 241
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  such reflections as occurred to me upon that sub- 
ject. 6 68 . 
. A man who has been. brought up among books, 
and is able to. talk of nothing else, is a very 
indifferent companion, and what we call a pedant. 
‘But, methinks, we should enlarge the title, and 
give it to every one that does not know how to 
think out of his profession and particular way 
of life. 
What isa greater-pedant than a mere man 
of the town? Bar him the play-houses, a catalog 
of the reigning beauties, and an account of a 
few fashionable distempers that have befallen 
him, and you strike him dumb. How many a 
pretty. gentleman’s knowledge lies ‘all within the 
verge of the court! He will tell you the names 
of the principal favorites, repeat the shrewd 
sayings of a man of quality, whisper an intrigue 
that. is not yet blown upon by common fame; 
or, if the sphere of his observation is a little 
larger than ordinary, will perhaps enter into all 
the incidents, turns, and revolutions in a game 
of ombre. When he has gone thus far, he has 
shown. you the whole circle of:his accomplish- 
ments, his parts are drained, and he is disabled 
from any further conversation. What are these 
but rank pedants? and yet these are the men 
who value. themselves: most on their exemption 
from the pedantry of colleges. 
I might here mention the military pedant, who 
always talks in a camp, and is storming towns, 
making lodgments,.and fighting battles from one 
end of the year to the ‘other. Everything he 
speaks ‘smells of gunpowder: if you take away 
his. artillery from him, he has not a. word to say 
242
-P-A-G-E-246
  JOSEPH ADDISON 
  for himself. I might likewise mention the law 
pedant, that is. perpetually putting cases, re- 
peating the transactions of Westminster Hall, 
wrangling with you upon the most indifferent 
circumstances of life, and not to, be convinced 
of the distance of a place, or of the most trivial 
point in conversation, but by dint: of argument. 
The state pedant is wrapt up in news, dnd lost 
in polities. If you mention either of the kings 
of Spain or Poland, he talks very notably; but 
if you go out of the Gazette, you drop him. In 
short, a mere courtier, a mere soldier, a mere 
scholar, a mere anything, is an insipid pedantic 
character, and equally ridiculous. 
Of all the species of pedants which I have 
mentioned, the book pedant is much the most 
supportable: he has at least an exercised under- 
standing, and a head which is full tho confused, 
so that a man who converses with him may often 
receive from him hints of things that are worth 
knowing, and what he may possibly turn to his 
own advantage, tho they are of little use to the 
owner. The worst kind of pedants among learned 
men are such as are naturally endowed with a 
very small share of common sense, and have read 
a great number of books without taste or dis- 
tinction. . . 
My friend Will Honeycomb, who was so un- 
mercifully witty upon the women, in a couple of 
letters which I lately communicated to the public, 
has given the ladies ample satisfaction by mar- 
rying a farmer’s daughter; a piece of news which 
eame to our club by the last post. The Templar 
is very positive that he has married a dairy- 
maid; but Will, in his letter to me on this occa- 
243
-P-A-G-E-247
  “THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  sion, sets the best face upon the matter that he 
can, and: gives a more tolerable account of his 
couse. E must. confess I suspected something 
more ithan ordinary, when upon. opening the let- 
ter. I found that Will was fallen off from his 
‘former gaicty, having changed Dear Spec, which 
was his usual salute at the beginning of the 
~, letter, into ‘(My worthy friend,’’ and subscribed 
himself at the latier end of it, at full length, 
‘. .. William Honeycomb. In short, the gay, the loud, 
.- the vain Will Honeyeomb, who had made love 
to every great fortune that has appeared in town 
for above thirty years together, and boasted of 
favors from ladies whom he had never seen, is 
at length wedded to a plain country girl. 
. His letter gives us the picture of a converted 
rake. The sober character of the husband is 
dashed with the man of the'town, and enlivened 
with those little eant phrases which have made 
tay friend Will often thought very pretty com- 
‘pany. But let us hear what he says for himself, 
    My; Worray Frienp. . 
I question not but you, and the rest of my 
acquaintance, wonder that I, who have lived in 
‘the smoke and gallantries of the town for thirty 
years together, should all on a sudden grow fond 
of a country life. Had not my dog of a steward 
run away as he did, without making up his ac- 
-eounts, I had still. been immersed in sin and 
sea-eoal. But since my late foreed visit to my 
estate, I am so pleased with it, that I am resolved 
to Hve and die upon it. I am every day abroad

  and purling streams. The simplicity of manners 
which I have heard you so often speak of, and 
which appears here in perfection, charms me 
wonderfully. As an instance of. it, I must ac- 
quaint you, and by your means the whole club, 
that I have lately married one of my tenants’ 
daughters. She is born of honest parents, and 
tho she has no portion she has a great deal of 
virtue. The natural sweetness and innocence of 
her behavior, the freshness of her complexion, 
the unaffected turn of her shape and person, 
shot me through and through every time I saw 
her, and did more execution upon me in grogram 
than the greatest beauty in town or court had 
ever done in brocade. - In short, she is such a 
one as promises me a good heir to, my estate; 
and if by her means I can not leave to my chil- 
dren what are falsely called: the gifts.of birth, 
high titles and alliances, I hope to convey to 
them the more real and valuable gifts of birth, 
strong bodies and healthy constitutions. As for 
your fine women, I need not tell thee that I know 
them. I have had my share in their graces, but 
no more of that. It shall be my business here- 
after to live the life of an honest man, and to 
act as becomes the master of a family. I ques- 
tion not but I shall draw upon me the raillery 
of the town, and be treated to the tune of ‘‘The 
Marriage-hater match’d’’; but I am prepared for 
it. I have been as witty upon others in my time. 
To tell thee truly, I saw such a tribe of fash- 
jonable young fluttering coxcombs shot up, that 
I did not think my post of an homme de ruelle 
any longer tenable. I felt a certain stiffness 
in my limbs, which entirely destroyed that jaun-

ee: PRIDE 'OF BIRTH‘ 
Horacs, Juvenal, Boiléau, and indeed the great- 
est writers ‘in almost every age, have exposed 
with all thestrength of wit and good: sense, the 
vanity of a'‘man’s valuing himself upon his an- 
cestors, and endeavored to show that true nobility 
consists in virtue, not in birth. With submission, 
however, to so many. great authorities, I think 
they have pushed this matter a little too far. 
We ought in gratitude to honor the posterity of 
those who have raised .either the interest or 
reputation of their country, and by whose labors 
we ourselves are more happy, wise, or virtuous 
than we should have been without them, Besides, 
naturally speaking, a man bids fairer for great-

ness of soul, who is the descendant of worthy 
ancestors, and has good blood. in his veins, than 
one who is come of an ignoble and obseure 
parentage. For these reasons, I think a man 
of merit, who is derived from an illustrious line, 
is very justly to be regarded more than a man 
of equal merit who has no claim to hereditary 
honors. Nay, I think those who are indifferent 
in themselves, and have nothing else to distin- 
guish them but the virtues of their forefathers, 
are to be looked upon with a degree of: venera- 
tion even upon that account, and to be more 
respected than the common run of men. who are 
of low and vulgar extraction. 
After having thus ascribed due honors to birth 
and parentage, I must, however, take notice of 
those who ‘arrogate to themselves more honors 
than are due to them upon this. account. The 
first are such who are not enough sensible that 
vice and ignorance taint the blood, and that an 
unworthy behavior degrades aud disennobles a 
man in the eyes of the world, as much as birth 
and family aggrandize and exalt him. 
The second are those who believe a new man 
of an elevated merit is not more to be honored 
than an insignificant and worthless man who. is 
descended from a long line of patriots and he- 
roes; or, in other words, behold with contempt 
@ person who is such a man as the first founder 
of their family was, upon whose reputation they 
value themselves. 
But I shall chiefly apply myself to those whose 
quality sits uppermost in all their discourses and 
behavior. An empty man of a great family is a 
creature that is scarce conversible. You read his

‘He has; indeed; nothing but his nobility to give

ofthis: turn began. a speech in one of King

which reigns in our nation has pretty well de- 
stroyed this starched behavior among men who 
have seen the world, and know that every gentle- 
‘man -will be treated. upon a foot of equality. But 
there are many who have had their education 
among women, dependents or flatterers, that lose 
all. tha respect. which would otherwise be paid 
them by bemng too assiduous in procuring it.

  ant.—-Your servant, Mr. Ironside-—Mr. Ducker, 
how do you do?—-Hah! Frank, are you there?’’ 
There is nothing more easy than to discover 
a man whose head is full of his family. Weak 
minds that have imbibed a strong tincture of the 
nursery, younger brothers that have been brought 
up to nothing, saperannuated retainers to. a great 
house, have generally their thoughts taken up 
with little else. 
I had some years ago an aunt of my own, by ~ 
name Mrs. Martha Ironside, who would never 
marry beneath herself, and is supposed to have 
died a maid in fourscorth year of her age. She 
was the chronicle of our family, and passed away . 
the greatest part’ of the last forty years of her 
life in recounting the antiquity, marriages, ex- 
ploits, and alliances of the Ironsides. Mrs. Mar- 
tha conversed generally with a knot of old vir- 
gins, who were likewise of good families, and had 
been very eruel all the beginning of the last 
sentury. They were every one of them as proud 
as Lucifer, but said their prayers twice a day, 
and in all other respects were the best women 
in the world. If they saw a fine petticoat at 
chureh, they immediately took to pieces the 
pedigree of her that wore it, and would lift ‘up, 
their eyes to heaven at the confidence. of the 
sauey minx, when they found she was. an honest 
tradesman’s daughter. It is impossible to de- 
seribe the pious indignation that would rise in 
them at the sight of a man who lived plentifully 
on an estate of his own getting. They were 
transported with zeal beyond measure, if they 
heard of a young woman’s matching into a great 
family upon account only of her. beauty, her

. would not eat a bit all dinner-time, if at an 
invitation she found she had been seated below 
herself; and would frown upon me for an hour 
together, if she saw me give place to any man 
under @ baronet. As I was once: talking to her 
of a wealthy citizen whom she had refused in 
her. youth, she declared to me with great warmth, 
that she preferred a. man of quality in his shirt 
to the richest man upon the change in a coach 
and six. She pretended that our family was 
nearly related by the mother’s side to half a 
dozen ‘peers; but as none of them knew anything 
of the matter, we always kept it as a secret 
among ourselves... A little before her death, she 
was reciting to me the history of my forefathers; 
but dwelling a little longer than ordinary upon 
the actions of Sir Gilbert Ironside, who had a 
horse shot under him at Edgehill fight, I gave an 
unfortunate pish! and asked, ‘‘What was all 
this to me?’’ upon which she retired to her 
closet and fell a-scribbling for three hours to- 
gether; in which time, as I afterwards found, 
she struck me out of her will, and left all that 
she had to my sister Margaret, a wheedling bag- 
gage, that used to be asking ‘questions about her

which is called after him. “All who know that

However, this hunior creates him rio enemies,

and his %eing’ unconfined to modes and forms

wson in a public eoffee-house, for calling him 
‘oongster. But, being ill used by the above- 
entioned ‘widow, he was very serious for a year 
and a half; and tho, his tempor being naturally 
.» jovial, he at last got over it, he grew careless 
of himself and never drest afterward. He con- 
tinues to wear a coat and doublet of the same 
eut that were in fashion at the time of his re- 
pulse, which, in his nierry humors he tells us, 
has ‘been in and out twelve times since he first 
wore it.’ He is now in his fifty-sixth year, cheer- 
ful, gay, and hearty; keeps a good house both 
in town and country; a great lover of mankind;

of the country come to see him, he only shows 
me at a distance: as I have been walking in his 
fields, I have observed them stealing a sight of 
me over an hedge, and have heard the knight 
desiring them not to let me see them, for that 
I hated to be stared at. 
I am the more at ease in Sir Roger’s family, 
because it eonsists of sober and staid persons: 
for, as the knight is the best master in the world, 
he seldom changes his servants; and, as he is 
beloved by all about him, his servants never 
care for leaving him; by this means his domes- 
ties are all in years, and grown old with their 
master. You would take his valet-de-chambre 
for his brother; his butler is gray-headed; his 
groom is one of the gravest men that I have 
ever seen; and his coachman has the looks of 
a privy-councillor, You see the goodness of the 
master even in the old house-dog, and in a gray 
pad that is kept in the stable with great care 
and tenderness, out of regard to his past services, 
tho he has been useless for several years. 
I could not but observe with a great deal of 
pleasure the joy that appeared in the countenance 
of these ancient domesties upon my friend’s ar- 
rival at his country-seat. Some of them could” . 
not refrain from tears at the sight of their old 
master; every one of them prest forward to do :: 
something for him, and seemed diseouraged if’ -

the-master of the family, tempered the in- 
ies. after his own affairs with several kind 
questions relating to themselves. This humanity

his servants.

renders his conversation highly agreeable, and 
more delightful than the same degree of sense

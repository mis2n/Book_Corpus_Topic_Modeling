THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Review of Work in 1924 
By Grorce E. Vincent 
PRESIDENT 
THE YEAR IN BRIEF 
During the year 1924 the International Health Board, the 
China Medical Board, the Division of Medical Education, 
and the Division of Studies of the Rockefeller Foundation (1) 
underwrote to the amount of $350,000 a plan for publishing 
an international abstract journal of the biological sciences; 
(2) began issuing bulletins which report progress in medical 
education in many countries; (3) helped to spread interna- 
tionally knowledge about medical equipment and teaching 
methods through surveys by staff members, commissions of 
scientists, visiting professors, and traveling fellows; (4) 
hastened developments in the medical schools of the universi- 
ties of Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Wales, Montreal, 
McGill, So Paulo, Hongkong, and Siam, and of the Ameri- 
can University at Beirut; (5) maintained a modern medical 
school and teaching hospital in Peking; (6) aided three other 
medical schools and 17 hospitals in China; (7) helped to im- 
prove the teaching of physics, chemistry, and biology in two 
Chinese and nine foreign institutions in China and in the 
Government University in Siam; (8) had a part in the de- 
velopment of professional training for sanitarians and 
hygienists at Harvard University and in schools and insti- 
tutes in London, Prague, Warsaw, and Sao Paulo; (9) gave 
funds for nursing education at Yale University and in schools 
and hospitals in Brazil, France, Yugoslavia, Poland, and the 
Philippines; (10) kept a mobile staff on guard against yellow 
fever in Mexico and Central America; (11) at the request of 
Brazil joined in an attack upon this disease from 11 centers 
along the northern coast; (12) helped to show the possibili-

malaria surveys or studies in Haiti, Porto Rico, Nicaragua, 
Brazil, Italy, Palestine, Queensland, and the Philippines; 
(13) either continued or began antihookworm work in con- 
junction with 32 states and countries in the West Indies, 
Central America and Mexico, South America, Europe, and 
the Far East; (14) contributed to the budgets of rural health 
services in 207 counties in 24 American states and in New 
Brunswick, Brazil, France, and Czechoslovakia; (15) con- 
tinued to aid the epidemiological intelligence service of the 
Health Section of the League of Nations; (16) contributed to 
the League of Nations’ international study tours or inter- 
changes for 99 health officers from 20 countries; (17) provided 
directly or indirectly fellowships for 864 individuals of 33 
different nations; (18) lent staff members and made minor 
gifts to many governments and institutions for various 
kinds of counsel and aid; (19) assisted mental hygiene proj- 
ects both in the United States and in Canada, demonstrations 
in dispensary development in New York City, the growth of 
antituberculosis work in France, and other undertakings in 
public health, medical education, and allied fields. 
GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 
The trustees of the Rockefeller Foundation administer a 
fund which represents a per capita of $1.50 for the people of 
the United States. The income if raised by popular sub- 
scription would call for a fraction over seven cents annually 
per head. Looked at in another way, the funds of the 
Foundation, measured by government expenditures, hospital 
support, or annual gifts for charity, are dwarfed into relative 
unimportance. Distribution to a large number of good 
causes might easily do little more than replace for a short 
time gifts from other sources. Concentration for consider- 
able periods upon vital activities in limited fields seems to be 
the only way of doing anything worth while and lasting. 
For the present, effort is centered on public health and 
medical education, but the trustees keep steadily in mind the
-P-A-G-E-9
  PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES 9 
  
  Datnouste Universtry Heaura Center 
This building, which was erected and equipped with funds provided by the Rocke- 
feller Foundation, serves as the out-patient department of several hospitals and as 
headquarters for various volunteer health agencies, thus providing the students in 
the medical school of the University with unusual facilities for clinical study of 
common illnesses and for tracing the connection between social and home conditions 
and health 
possibility that in time other things may also offer opportuni- 
ties. Concentration in any field is not interpreted as 
permanent or rigid. 
The Foundation seeks direct relations with responsible 
agencies which are charged with carrying on a given work for 
the future. This means of course that nothing is under- 
taken until a careful first-hand study has been made by 
representatives of the Foundation. Thus when field demon- 
strations of disease control are made the International 
Health Board deals only with government agencies. So, 
too, plans for medical school development are carried out in 
conjunction with permanently established universities. 
Moreover, the Foundation expects governments and univer- 
sities from the outset of a common undertaking to make a 
contribution in money or its equivalent in facilities or serv- 
ices. That is, aid is conditioned upon a substantial contribu- 
tion from other sources. Again, help is given only for 
demonstrations of innovation and improvement. The
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
Foundation takes no interest in the merely quantitative ex- 
pansion of routine activities. There must be promise of 
qualitative advance in a given piece of scientific, administra- 
tive, or educational work. 
There is another guiding principle of the Foundation. It 
withdraws entirely from a project as soon as this has become 
self-directing and self-supporting. The International Health 
Board ordinarily expects to bring its part in a demonstration 
of hookworm 
or malaria 
control or of 
county health 
work to an 
end within a 
short and 
limited pe- 
riod. The

“The Princess Kazi’’, a fairy play based on Czech mythology, 
is designed to aid in the fight against tuberculosis by teaching less as the 
children the love of nature, the woods, and the open air. 
Among the newer activities of the Ministry of Public Health, gover nment 
organized with the aid of the International Health Board, pub- takes over 
lic health education has an important place 
more and 
more of the burden. The project is regarded as a success 
when the public funds bear the whole cost. In the case 
of a medical school or institute of hygiene project, as 
soon as the university or government has complied with the 
conditions the Foundation pays its share and has no further 
responsibility. It scrupulously refrains from all intervention 
in the administration of the institution. 
The foregoing strictly applies only to major undertakings. 
The Foundation is ready, on request, to lend expert service 
(see page 41) or give minor kinds of emergency (see page 39) 
or other aid unconditionally to health departments, medical 
schools, institutes of hygiene, and a few nurse-training 
centers when this is feasible. Even in such instances, in-
-P-A-G-E-11
PROGRESS OF RESEARCH 11 
creases of public funds and of private gifts are likely to be 
hastened. 
BROADCASTING THE PROGRESS OF RESEARCH 
Although as this review is written a marine expedition is 
sending from the Sargasso Sea wireless reports of its discover- 
ies, it is hard to imagine the many centers of scientific re- 
search broadcasting their results even to a waiting world of 
savants. Science does not take kindly to methods so pre- 
cipitate and breathless. But some system of frequent and 
regular communication between investigators is essential if 
useless duplication of effort is to be avoided and the stimulus 
and suggestions from new knowledge are to be made ef- 
fective with reasonable promptness throughout the world. 
The output of scientific books and articles is enormous. 
It has been estimated that there are today in the field of 
medicine alone 1,500 journals which print about 100,000 
papers annually. The Index Medicus with its 1,000 pages 
reports about 40,000 articles each year. The Surgeon 
General’s library in Washington has catalogued since 1880, 
1,400,000 articles and 330,000 book titles. The task of sift- 
ing, listing, indexing, and in many cases making brief ab- 
stracts of scientific articles has become almost overwhelming. 
It is reported that 129 bibliographical reviews and 153 serial 
publications print abstracts or summaries. Chemical 
Abstracts alone condenses each year into 5,000 pages the 
substance of 100,000 pages of original articles. 
A plan for creating, possibly in Geneva, a world center of 
bibliography and summarizing from which international 
catalogues, indexes, and abstract journals wouldbedistributed 
to the scientific workers of all countries makes a certain ap- 
peal to the imagination. But language difficulties, the loca- 
tion of great libraries in different capitals, the vested interests 
of existing journals, and national rivalries and ambitions 
make such a scheme for the present at least seem almost 
Utopian. 
Eighteen societies of biologists in the United States have
-P-A-G-E-12
12 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
combined to found and maintain on an international scale an 
abstract journal of the biological sciences. This is a field in 
which such service is sorely needed. It is said that 40,000 
articles in various divisions of biology are published annually. 
Representatives who have visited European countries believe 
that the chances of bringing about consolidations or at any 
rate exchanges of material with certain biological abstract 
journals are excellent. The Rockefeller Foundation through 
its Division of Studies has pledged the sum of $350,000 to- 
ward a ten-year period of test and demonstration. It is 
expected that the Concilium Bibliographicum (an indexing 
and abstracting agency) of Zurich, to which the Foundation 
has been making a small annual gift, will be incorporated in 
the new project. The emergency distribution of medical 
literature in Europe (see page 40) is an effort to restore 
scientific communications which were interrupted by the 
war. 
DISTRIBUTION OF FACTS ABOUT MEDICAL 
EDUCATION 
For three years the Foundation has been trying to com- 
plete an accurate list of the medical schools of all countries. 
A revised list, still defective, based upon government reports, 
correspondence, specialsurveys, and staff visits, wasissued dur- 
ing 1924. The total number of schools in 69 different na- 
tions is 456. One reason for gathering these facts was to 
have a mailing list to which from time to time information 
about medical education in different countries could be ad- 
dressed. While a good deal is published on this subject the 
articles appear in a great variety of scattered periodicals and 
reports. There is no international journal which specializes 
in the problems of buildings, equipment, organization, 
courses of study, methods of instruction, and other features 
of modern training in the science and art of medicine. 
The Division of Medical Education has no idea of setting 
up a formal periodical in this field but it has planned a series 
of bulletins to be issued from time to time as accumulated

material seems to warrant. The officers in their visits to 
medical schools, from conversations with medical teachers 
and from articles in the medical and general press learn of 
new things which seem likely to be of interest and value to 
persons responsible for medical education. The administra- 
tors and teachers who are immediately in charge of these new 
projects are asked to prepare descriptive articles. These are 
illustrated with floor plans and photographs of buildings or 
other appropriate diagrams and pictures. 
The first bulletin entitled “Methods and Problems of 
Medical Education” was issued in September, 1924, and 
sent to deans of medical schools and to many others. It 
contained 12 papers, 8 in English, 3 in German, and one in 
French, written by professors who describe the housing, 
equipment, organization, and methods of research and teach-

ing in their respective departments. Of these departments 
two are at Yale University, two at Peking Union Medical 
College, and one each at the University of Wisconsin, Uni- 
versity College (London), the Free University of Brussels, 
the University of Wirzburg, the University of Basel, the 
University of Gratz, the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory 
(Boston), and the Boston Lying-in Hospital. In the publica- 
tion of these bulletins the Division disclaims all desire or 
intention to advocate any particular systems or standard- 
ized methods of organization and teaching. The aim 
is not propaganda but merely the dissemination of impor- 
tant information secured at first hand from authoritative 
sources. 
The Foundation is in no formal way a bureau of informa- 
tion. Its own representatives, however, visited medical 
schools in 30 countries and incidentally carried ideas from 
one center to another. Ten professors of medicine from 
foreign countries were given an opportunity for study or 
observation in the United States; others were sent to Europe 
and to the East (see page 17). The fellowships (see page 39) 
of the Division of Medical Education played an appreciable 
part in the international commerce of ideas. 
HASTENING THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MEDICAL SCHOOLS 
Many excellent medical schools in influential centers have 
plans for improvement but lack the necessary funds to carry 
them out. Governments do not ordinarily lavish money on 
science and professional education. Private donors are 
sometimes hard to convince. An institution thus gets on a 
dead center. An outside force is needed to set things go- 
ing. To give such an impetus is precisely what the Founda- 
tion can frequently do. A representative is invited to visit a 
significant school and with dean, faculty, and trustee repre- 
sentatives, to go over its needs and plans. He has no pre- 
conceived scheme to urge but often out of his wide experience 
in many countries he can make useful suggestions. A pro-
-P-A-G-E-15

gram is finally agreed upon tentatively. The Foundation 
promises to give a certain sum toward buildings or endow- 
ment or both, provided the institution will secure from other 
sources a specified amount, or provided a government will 
agree to increase the annual budget of maintenance to a 
designated new level. An offer of this kind is weleomed as

The new pathology building, completed in 1924, is a part of a general plan of 
development for the medical school of McGill University, which the Rockefeller 
Foundation has helped to finance 
a means of realizing more quickly a plan otherwise likely to 
be delayed, sometimes indefinitely. 
During 1924 several contingent arrangements with medical 
schools were in process of fulfilment. Payments were made 
to the University of Edinburgh toward the endowment of a 
chair of surgery, to the University of Wales for the develop- 
ment of the department of medicine at Cardiff, to Oxford 
University for the proper housing and support of biochemis- 
try, to McGill University, Montreal, for the endowment of a 
university chair of medicine, to the University of Hongkong 
for endowment of a chair of obstetrics, and to the University 
of Montreal for the continued support of premedical teach-

ing. A request from the University of Copenhagen to assist 
in bringing together in a new laboratory five departments of 
physiology which are now scattered widely in the city of 
Copenhagen, led to the promise of a substantial sum for this 
purpose. 
Plans for the reorganization and staffing of the Siamese 
Government medical school in Bangkok made steady prog- 
ress. The King Edward VII Medical School in Singapore

ance was of- 
fered to the American University at Beirut to strengthen 
its medical school for a five-year period during which per-

During the year representatives of the Division of Medical 
Education made special studies of medical schools in Den- 
mark, Italy, France, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, the Philippines, 
Java, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. In con- 
nection with emergency aid (see page 40) visits were made to 
medical centers in all but three of the countries of Central 
and Eastern Europe. Visiting professors were sent to 
Copenhagen and to Sao Paulo in Brazil. 
    
MEDICAL PROGRESS IN PEKING

in the capital of China, an outpost of teaching and research

in the Far East. It includes a medical school for both 
undergraduate and graduate students, a teaching hospital, 
a school of nursing, and a premedical department. Be- 
cause co-operation with an existing institution, governmental 
or private, did not seem feasible, the Foundation through 
its China Medical Board took over a school that had been 
started under missionary auspices. It created a new board 
of trustees, built, manned, and is now supporting the ex- 
panded and reorganized College. 
The members of the medical faculty and their assistants 
number 79 of whom 41 are foreigners and 38 Chinese. The 
teachers are graduates of 40 medical schools and represent 
9 different countries. There are besides 25 teachers in the 
premedical and nursing schools. While among the foreign- 
ers citizens of the United States predominate, the institution 
is administered in no narrowly nationalistic spirit. Of the 
six visiting professors who were in Peking for varying periods 
during the past year one was an eminent ophthalmologist of 
Vienna, and another a distinguished anatomist from the 
Netherlands, and a third a Chinese physiologist. It is the 
fixed policy of the College to recruit its staff so far as possible 
from Chinese sources. A large percentage of the lower 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
18 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
positions are filled by Chinese appointees, from whom it is 
hoped to select men and women for higher posts. Already 
three Chinese doctors have been advanced to the rank of 
associate professor. One is in charge of a department. 
The Peking Union Medical College has no desire to be an 
independent center of foreign influence in China. It seeks 
to serve the 
bestinterests 
of the Chi- 
nese people, 
in harmony 
withnational 
purposesand 
ideals. Be-

government were consulted about the proposals of the Rocke- 
feller Foundation for medical work in China. They gave 
hearty approval. At the formal opening in 1921 the 
President was officially represented and cabinet ministers 
cordially welcomed the institution as a prized agency of 
education. It is regularly registered with the Ministry of 
Education in Peking as an officially approved medical 
school of university grade. The trustees hope that the time 
will come when the College and Hospital may be put under 
Chinese control and made an organic part of the Chinese 
system of education. 
In October, 1924, the students numbered 208 and were
-P-A-G-E-19
  MEDICAL EDUCATION 19 
distributed as follows: medical school 62, school of nursing 
20, premedical school 60, graduate and special students 66. 
The graduate registration was incomplete. During the 
year 1923-1924, 113 doctors and nurses, Chinese and foreign, 
did graduate work either in regular courses extending over 
several months or in short intensive courses especially de- 
signed for missionary doctors and others who cannot leave 
their posts for long periods. 
In one respect the Peking Union Medical College is unique. 
Its staff members devote all their time to the service of the 
institution. They do not engage in private practice. In 
consequence the faculty has developed a spirit of team-work 
which at once strikes the visitor from abroad. A consider- 
able amount of excellent investigative work is done each 
year. Cautious experiments in changing the order of 
studies and methods of teaching are being carried out. 
Careful tests of student capacity and accomplishment are 
being applied. In this environment undergraduates and 
young doctors, find exceptional opportunities for technical 
training and for developing a spirit of comradeship in 
science. ; 
Obviously the College must seek close relations with Chi- 
nese education and the life of the people. The China Med- 
ical Board is aiding premedical education in 11 institutions, 
both Chinese and foreign, by grants toward buildings, 
equipment, and current maintenance, by providing the 
services of experts in science teaching and by supporting 
a summer institute which in 1924 was attended by 130 
teachers of physics, chemistry, and biology, who represented 
86 Chinese and foreign schools and colleges. 
To interpret the aims of the College and Hospital to the 
people of Peking and the Chinese public an advisory com- 
mittee of prominent Chinese citizens has been appointed. 
This group has made useful suggestions and has shown an 
interest in the institution. In furtherance of its main 
purpose the Board has continued contributions to the Na- 
tional Medical College, Peking, and the medical schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-20

of Shantung Christian University and of the Hunan-Yale 
institution at Changsha, and in 1924 aided 17 hospitals in 
various parts of the country. Minor items of aid and service 
are reported on pages 42 and 43. 
THE DOCTOR OF THE FUTURE A HEALTH 
COUNSELLOR 
The medical schools of many countries, especially, per- 
haps, those of North America, Great Britain, and to a less 
degree of Western Continental Europe, are facing several 
problems of curriculum, of teaching methods, of purpose and 
of aim. An American committee has been formed to ex- 
amine the course of study in the United States and to rec- 
ommend changes. This committee will be expected to find 
answers to such questions as these: What kind or kinds of 
doctors ought the medical school to turn out in response to 
the needs and demands of the public? What should grad- 
uates know and be able to do? How best can they be helped 
to master this knowledge and skill? How can they be given 
the right attitude toward their work? 
Probably three quarters of all doctors today are general 
practitioners, that is, physicians whose aim it is to recognize 
diseases, to deal with all the more common maladies by ad- 
vice and treatment, and to know when to refer patients to 
specialists. This general practitioner is at present facing 
many difficulties. The specialist tends to monopolize pres- 
tige and to receive relatively much larger fees. Laboratory 
and hospital facilities which the modern doctor ought to have 
are expensive and often inaccessible. Sanitation and pre- 
ventive medicine are restricting and even eliminating dis- 
eases like typhoid and malaria which once afforded a good 
deal of practice. Free and pay clinics, school and industrial 
medical services, health insurance (under government aus- 
pices in Germany and England), hospital associations and 
all efforts to spread costs of sickness over large population 
groups, and other forms of social medicine tend to encroach 
upon what was once the exclusive field of the general prac-
-P-A-G-E-21

titioner. There are people who assert that this type of phy- 
sician is doomed; that he will disappear because he cannot 
compete with the specialist on the one hand and with pre- 
ventive and social medicine on the other. 
Such an outcome is to be viewed with concern. The well- 
trained, properly equipped, experienced general practitioner 
of ability, character, 
and personality is a

uable person. He

will have to submit to a measure of team-work in the use of 
laboratories and other resources; he will be compelled to 
recognize the public demand for sharing costs of sickness and, 
most important of all, he must become a practitioner of pre- 
ventive medicine, a counsellor of health, a man who can rec- 
ognize and correct the minor but remediable physical and 
mental defects which are so common. This will mean an 
increasing preoccupation with the normal and a knowledge of 
the effects upon health of diet, exercise, mental attitudes, 
recreation, and family and social life. To train men and 
women for this reinterpreted and redirected function the 
medical schools will be compelled radically to modify their 
aims and methods and to “permeate the curriculum with the 
preventive idea.” 
PREPARATION FOR PROTECTING THE 
PUBLIC HEALTH 
“Hygeia,” says a well-known teacher of preventive med- 
icine, “has long been the Cinderella of the medical family.” 
In spite of the progress of public health work the medical 
schools have too generally neglected or slighted the preven- 
tive side of medicine. This has had an unfortunate result. 
The average physician fails to see as clearly as he should that 
he is a vital part of the public health organization, that he is 
expected to discover and to report communicable diseases, to 
instruct his patients, to support the local authorities, to help 
create sound public opinion. 
The Harvard Medical School, among others, is trying to 
impress upon its students the fact that the doctor has a duty 
not only to the individual but to the community. Every 
undergraduate is required to make a sanitary survey of a vil- 
lage, town, or small city. This study includes a general de- 
scription of the place, followed by detailed reports on water, 
sewage, disposal of refuse, vital statistics, milk, sanitary 
nuisances, industrial hygiene, housing, infectious diseases, 
schools, and miscellaneous items. The educative effect of 
such a piece of work upon the future physician needs no elab-

oration. A facsimile reproduction of one of these surveys 
has been issued (see page 13) by the Division of Medical Edu- 
cation. Harvard has also created a special committee which 
will assist every teacher in the medical school to include in his 
courses the preventive aspects of his subject. If this can be 
done, hygiene will not be a 
thing apart but a body of 
knowledge and a point of view 
diffused throughout the cur- 
riculum. Toward the cost 
of this experiment the Foun- 
dation has made an appropria- 
tion. 
The successful teaching of 
hygiene to medical students 
will increase the number of 
well-trained persons who choose 
this field as a career, but no 
undergraduate course can fit 
men and women for specialized 
service in vreventive medicine.

THE NURSE IN HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY 
To both medical education and public health work the 
modern trained nurse is indispensable. She is found in the 
wards and dispensary of the hospital; she follows discharged 
patients to their homes; she responds to the calls of the sick 
poor; she reports cases of communicable diseases; she is an 
attendant in the health center and in the industrial clinic; she 
serves in the school and in the families of the pupils; she goes 
her rounds in city, town, and village and of late has made 
her way to isolated farmsteads in the open country. She is 
at the same time nurse, teacher, public official, and friend. 
For the successful discharge of her duties the nurse needs 
more than sympathy and devotion, essential as these qual- 
ities are. Apprenticeship experience alone will not suffice. 
There must be both education and training in hospital, dis- 
pensary, and in the field. Widening opportunities are mak- 
ing larger demands. Changes in the organization and meth- 
ods of nurse education are taking place, experiments are 
being tried, new schools are being created. Countries in 
which this type of training has not been developed are 
adopting modern ideas of teaching and practical appren- 
ticeship. 
Because of an interest in medical education and public 
health the Rockefeller Foundation has aided demonstrations 
in nursing education in several countries. During 1924, it 
continued to support a training school experiment at Yale 
University, contributed to a school of nursing in Rio de 
Janeiro, assisted a bureau of public health visiting in France, 
helped to establish schools of both public health and bedside 
nursing at the University of Cracow, Poland, and at Zagreb, 
Yugoslavia, aided the public health nursing service in the 
Philippine Islands, granted 39 fellowships for training, made 
surveys of nursing education in several European countries, 
invited leaders in nursing education to visit foreign coun-

tries, and sent a commission from the School of Nursing in 
Lyons to observe hospital schools and methods in Great 
Britain. 
SMOLDERING FIRES OF YELLOW FEVER 
An outbreak of yellow fever in Salvador (75 cases with 22 
deaths) in the summer of 1924 was an unanticipated episode 
in a campaign which began in 1918 under the leadership of 
General Gorgas as head of a commission of the International 
Health Board. Control work had been carried on in Mexico 
and Central America, Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, 
and Brazil, with a reconnaissance on the Gold and Ivory 
Coasts of West Africa. No case of the fever had been re- 
ported from Central America since 1921. It was hoped and 
believed that with the possible exception of a small focus of 
infection in Colombia the disease had been eliminated from 
the entire area which lies between the Rio Grande and the 
northern boundary of Brazil. This epidemic, however, 
taught its lessons. It showed the value of keeping a mobile 
staff of experts on call. Doctors on duty at other points were 
instructed by cable to go at once to Salvador to help the Gov- 
ernment bring the outbreak under control. The prompt- 
ness with which this was done proved that international or- 
ganization against disease can be speedy and effective. 
The unexpected flare-up in Salvador had another result. 
It forced a careful review of the theory and practice of anti- - 
yellow fever work. How was this outbreak to be explained? 
Had the infection been brought in from outside or had the 
previous campaign failed to extinguish the fire completely 
and left embers smoldering? No absolute answer can be 
given, but there is reason to think that there may be more 
than was originally supposed of those endemic areas, i. e., 
cities, towns, or even clusters of villages between which peo- 
ple are constantly passing to and fro and in which the fever is 
always present. Guayaquil, in Ecuador, which was freed 
from the disease in 1919 had long been a conspicuous endemic 
center from which the fever was distributed by land routes

and by ships. Now that the major sources of danger no 
longer exist north of Brazil, any minor foci which may re- 
main will be sure to reveal themselves, as the flare-up in 
Salvador has shown. 
It is also true that the part which babies and young chil- 
dren play in keeping yellow fever alive may have been under- 
estimated. Unless the mosquitoes by which alone the dis- 
ease is carried from person to person can find susceptible 
victims the malady quickly burns itself out. There are no 
“carriers” of yellow fever as in the case of malaria or even 
typhoid. The people who are attacked either die or get 
well. A survivor is free from the germs and immune against 
a second infection. So it comes about that even if control of  
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
mosquito breeding is neglected in a given community yellow 
fever will disappear provided non-immune persons do not 
come in from the outside to keep the infection going. But in 
settled human groups babies are arriving constantly and 
growing into boys and girls who are susceptible. Children 
usually have the disease in a mild form; very often it is not 
even recognized for what it is. Yet from these sick children 
mosquitoes may become as dangerously infective as from the 
severest cases. So it may happen that in a large city or a 
series of small towns the fever is kept alive without anyone 
realizing it until adult, non-immune strangers begin coming 
in. Then smoldering embers leap into flame. A vigilant 
watch is being kept against such possibilities. The surveys 
made in Mexico, Guatemala, British Honduras, Nicaragua, 
Honduras, Colombia, and the Guianas failed to reveal any 
cases of yellow fever. 
BRAZIL’S SUCCESSFUL CONTROL OF 
YELLOW FEVER 
Oswaldo Cruz, soon after the method of combating yellow 
fever had been worked out in Cuba in 1901, freed Rio de 
Janeiro and southern Brazil of the disease, but measures for 
protecting the northern section were never carried through 
to complete success. In 1923 an invitation from the Goy- 
ernment to the International Health Board to take part in a 
new and, it was hoped, final campaign in northern Brazil 
was accepted. 
Dr. Noguchi of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Re- 
search, the discoverer of the yellow fever germ, made a jour- 
ney to Bahia where he demonstrated to a group of Brazilian 
doctors his delicate methods of detecting the elusive organ- 
ism. He was able also to make further tests which con- 
firmed the specific character of the germ. He was soon fol- 
lowed by a corps of men experienced in yellow fever work. 
In conjunction with federal and state health services 11 posts 
were set up in towns and cities along the coast from Victoria 
in the south to Manaos in the north. Large local staffs of
-P-A-G-E-29
PUBLIC HEALTH 29 
inspectors and assistants were organized. From these cen- 
ters, also, work in outlying areas was administered. 
When work began in these 11 places yellow fever mosqui- 
toes were found to be breeding in or near 80 per cent of the 
houses in a city at one extreme of the list and in 22 per cent 
of the habitations in the community at the other. Within a 
few months this had been reduced to 15 per cent in the first 
city and to 5 to 1 per cent in the others. It has been shown 
that when mosquitoes are breeding in only about 5 per cent of 
the houses there is little or no danger that the disease will 
spread. The exact percentage for safety varies with the lo- 
cality, the number of non-immunes, the climate, and the sea- 
son. ‘To be on the safe side the index, as this percentage is 
called, is reduced to the lowest point possible, often 1 or 2 per 
cent, and kept there in the key points for a year before the 
area is regarded as free. 
The antibreeding measures consist for the most part in 
either covering or screening all water containers to prevent

the mosquitoes from depositing eggs or, when this is not fea- 
sible, in keeping fish in the open receptacles. These fish eat 
the larvae or “wigglers” before the adult mosquitoes are set 
free. To insure success the control work is systematically 
organized and carried out under vigilant supervision. No 
cases have been reported since October 21, 1924. With the 
Brazilian campaign well in hand and a corps on guard in case 
of a recurrence of such outbreaks as that in Salvador, the 
Board will turn its attention to the West Coast of Africa. A 
staff is being prepared for a reconnaissance in the early future. 
STUDIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS IN 
MALARIA CONTROL 
Malaria is a more difficult disease to control than yellow 
fever. The malaria parasites continue to live in people’s 
blood unless destroyed 
by the persistent use 
of quinine in sufficient 
quantities over a period 
of several years. Then, 
too, the malaria mos- 
quitoes are of several 
closely related species 
and, unlike the highly 
domesticated yellow 
fever insect, breed in 
natural collections of 
water, ponds, reservoirs, 
and ditches, often at a 
distance from human 
habitation. Thus ma- 
laria control is by no 
vie reac Hits “yds Me"Winece Means technically easy, ConTAINER except in the most fa- 
vorable circumstances, 
and may not be economically feasible. In extreme cases 
malaria may and does make whole regions practically unin-     
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  PUBLIC HEALTH 31 
habitable. In many parts of the world, for example, in 
large areas of the tropics, along the Italian coasts, in 
Macedonia and Greece, malaria is a dangerous, even 
deadly, foe. Several British colonies, the Panama Canal 
Administration, the Italian Government, and the United 
States Public Health Service, among others, have demon- 
strated the possibility of effecting varying degrees of control 
by large and small scale drainage, the oiling or Paris-greening 
of pools, the use of fish, the administration of quinine, the 
screening of houses, etc. 
Since 1916 the International Health Board has contributed 
to demonstrations in malaria control, especially in towns and 
in counties which include urban and rural districts. During 
1924 the Board aided 13 states, 23 counties, and one town in 
the United States and maintained demonstration units in 
four Brazilian villages near Rio de Janeiro. In the three of 
these latter places in which work had been carried on for 
some time the decline in the number of cases was marked. 
In response to the need of more knowledge about the vari- 
eties, life histories, habits, preference for human or animal 
blood, and the diseases of malaria mosquitoes, about the mal- 
adies of the fish that are set to eat the larvae, about malaria 
in birds, about the possibilities of re-enforcing quinine with 
other substances, studies and experiments were made by 
specialists in the United States, Austria, Italy, Palestine, 
Brazil, Nicaragua, the Philippine Islands, and Porto Rico. 
Two training stations for malaria workers were maintained, 
one in Leesburg, Georgia, the other near Rio de Janeiro. 
THE HOOKWORM AS ADVANCE AGENT OF 
HEALTH 
In contrast with yellow fever and malaria, hookworm dis- 
ease is a simple malady. The process by which tiny worms 
hatched in a warm and moist soil make their way through 
the skin of a human host and finally come to rest in the small 
intestine is well understood and can be clearly explained even 
to the most ignorant. The vermifuges which expel the para-
-P-A-G-E-32
  32 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
sites are simple and cheap. The building and use of sanitary 
latrines put a stop to the pollution of the soil and protect 
the population against reinfection. To weaken the hold and 
bring under control a disease which robs of vitality, stunts, 
cripples, handicaps, and even kills millions throughout the 
hot and moist regions of the world is vitally important in it- 
self. The International Health Board is an outgrowth of the 
original Rocke- 
feller Sanitary 
Commission 
which was or- 
ganized in 1909 
to combat the 
disease in the 
SouthernStates. 
Since then the 
campaign has

trol of hook- 
worm disease does more than give relief from one malady. 
It is an object lesson in public health. It shows a 
community what organized, concerted effort under trained 
leadership can accomplish. It is in a real sense an advance 
agent of preventive medicine, an educator of the public. 
The Board has purposely co-operated in the control of 
hookworm disease as a way of helping local and central 
governments to establish or extend their general health 
organizations. Thus in the United States, Brazil, Australia, 
and elsewhere hookworm units as such have been merged in 
regular health services. 
Elsewhere hookworm measures are continued. In 1924 
the Board assisted 24 states and countries from the West

Indies to Siam, Java, and Ceylon to control the disease, and 
in eight countries made surveys to find out the extent of the 
hookworm problem. As usual, government appropriations 
were increased while the Board’s share diminished. Simple 
as hookworm disease seems, much is still to be learned 
about soil pollution, drugs, various effects of the disease ac- 
cording to age, sex, race, etc. So research went on in the 
Southern States of the United States and in other countries, 
notably China. 
BETTER HEALTH FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE 
The idea that rural life is inherently wholesome and health- 
ful has all the vitality of a popular legend. The crystal 
waters of the old family well, the gymnasium apparatus of 
plow and hoe and saw, the fresh food from field, garden, and 
dairy, the constant outdoor life, the mental serenity which 
comes from contact with nature have been so lyrically ex- 
tolled by orators, chiefly urban, that it is hard to convince the 
man in the street that the farmer and his family are not 
healthier than city folk. 
Yet there are many facts which point in quite the opposite 
direction. An examination of a half million school children 
proved that physical defects occur more frequently in rural 
pupils than in urban. Since 1910 the New York rural death- 
rate has been higher than that of cities. On the other hand, 
for the country as a whole the rural rate is lower than the 
urban. Certain reports on army recruits seem to. be more 
favorable to young men from rural regions. The use of differ- 
ent standards of “rural” and “urban,” however, often makes 
comparisons misleading. New light has recently been 
thrown on this question by the examination of 3,478 male 
students in one of the large state universities of the Middle 
West. The results are distinctly favorable to the large cities 
of over 50,000 population as compared with small cities, 
countryside, and villages. The students from the large 
cities show the lowest number of physical defects. “It-is.a 
well-known fact,” says‘a United States health official, “that
-P-A-G-E-34
34 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
the natural advantages which the rural districts possess are 
more than offset by the better health protection afforded the 
city dweller.” 
To hasten the extension of these safeguards to the small 
town, village, and countryside is one of the aims of the Inter- 
national Health Board. Success in the control of hookworm 
disease has led in the Southern States to the creation of official 
county health organizations, and in other states and a few 
foreign countries similar services have been assisted. These 
county units vary in size, scope, and cost. The usual staff 
includes a full-time health officer, a sanitary inspector or of- 
ficer, a public health nurse, anda clerk. The annual cost for 
such an organization is $10,000. This is paid chiefly by the 
county but in part by the state. In many instances the In- 
ternational Health Board makes a contribution while the 
plan is being tested. The Board’s share varies with the con- 
ditions. Sometimes 10 per cent of the total cost will be 
enough to get a project under way. In other cases aid up to 
25 per cent may be required. In rare instances it may seem 
wise to giveeven more. The duration of the Board’s partici- 
pation likewise follows no rigid rule. At times three years 
will suffice. Ordinarily by the end of five years the Board has 
withdrawn. In special cases aid for a longer period may 
seem justified. In 1924 the Board contributed directly to 83 
county budgets in 22 states of the United States, four coun- 
ties in the State of Sao Paulo, and five demonstrations in the 
State of Minas Geraes, in Brazil, to rural health work in the 
Province of New Brunswick, Canada, and to a health service 
of the county unit type in Czechoslovakia and the Depart- 
ment of Hérault in southern France. 
INTERNATIONAL TEAMWORK IN HEALTH SERVICE 
Municipal and rural or county health organizations are the 
units of state or provincial machinery which in turn forms 
part of a national service. The leading countries have or- 
ganized their systems of public hygiene with varying degrees
-P-A-G-E-35
PUBLIC HEALTH 35 
of efficiency. The colonial administrations, notably of Great 
Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Japan, have 
created agencies of health in their possessions or mandated 
territories. The Government of the United States, directly 
in the Panama Canal Zone and indirectly in Porto Rico and 
the Philippine Islands, has improved sanitary and hygienic 
conditions. 
The gradual movement toward a closer world-wide team- 
work of these national 
systems is significant. The 
chief steps in this progress 
have been (1) the inter- 
national sanitary confer- 
ences in Paris in 1851 and 
1859 to concert quaran- 
tine measures chiefly 
against cholera, typhus, and 
yellow fever, (2) the setting 
up in 1907 of the Office 
International d’Hygiéne 
Publique in Paris to aid in 
carrying out continuously 
the provisions of an inter- 
national convention con- 
cerning quarantine, in seek- 
ing uniformity in vital 
statistics, etc., (3) the crea- 
tion of the Pan American 
Sanitary Bureau, (4) the Nurses on Dury i THe Pamppine

Section of the League of tour of inspection by public health nurses 
Nations, and (5) the reach- 
ing of working agreements between the League, the Office, 
and the Pan American Bureau. 
The Health Section of the League gathers and distributes 
vital statistics, organizes international interchanges of health 
officers, seeks to improve methods of reporting births, deaths,

and the presence of communicable diseases, aids in standard- 
izing sera and vaccines, and renders many other formsof health 
service, e. g., special commissions on typhus and malaria. 
Since 1922 the Foundation, through the International Health 
Board, has been contributing toward the support of the 
epidemiological intelligence service and the health officer

On September 15, 1924, Costa Rica’s Liberty Day, a health procession was held 
by the schools and reviewed by the President of the Republic. The establishment 
of a national health service on a permanent basis is one of the results of a hookworm 
campaign conducted from 1915 to 1921 
interchange of the League’s Health Section. During 1924 
the Board also agreed to aid for a five-year period an experi- 
ment in maintaining at Singapore a regional headquarters 
for the more prompt and accurate reporting of epidemic and 
other disease conditions in the Far East and administering a 
proposed: maritime sanitary convention. The outlines of a 
co-ordinated world health service begin clearly to emerge. 
STUDY TOURS FOR HEALTH OFFICIALS. 
The League’s plan for. interchanges. of health: personnel 
deserves brief description... If international team-work in
-P-A-G-E-37
  PUBLIC HEALTH 37 
preventive medicine is to be genuinely successful the men and 
women in charge in each country must have a vivid sense of 
the task as a whole, must have confidence in their colleagues 
across national borders, must be ready to learn from the 
experience of other countries, and must be magnanimous in 
putting their own knowledge at the disposal of all who may 
wish to profit by it. The printed page does a great deal but 
at best gives a blurred picture. Short international confer- 
ences and casual journeys abroad have value but may easily 
result in superficial, often misleading, impressions. 
The interchanges of the League are something more than 
junkets of hygienists. They are genuine study tours or 
institutes. A group of health administrators and specialists 
from several countries assemble in the chief city of a given 
nation, listen to preliminary expositions, then in small sec- 
tions spend considerable periods in the field inspecting in- 
stitutions and work in progress. Finally the visitors re- 
assemble for conference and discussion. Often more than 
one country will be studied in this way by the same inter- 
change group. To point out in any detail the value of this 
plan in the diffusion of knowledge, increase of efficiency, and 
the fostering of a professional comradeship, would be to 
“elaborate the obvious.” 
During 1924 in addition to the general exchanges two 
special exchanges were organized, one for persons interested 
in tuberculosis, another for school medical officers. The 
general interchanges, attended by 99 officers from 20 coun- 
tries, were held in Great Britain (February 2 to April 10), 
in the Netherlands and Denmark (April 24 to July 12), and in 
Switzerland (August 10 to September 17). Twenty-eight 
officers from 13 countries attended the gatherings of specialists. 
The tuberculosis group spent 100 days in eight countries; the 
school medical officers divided 42 days of study between three 
nations. In addition to these official League interchanges 
the International Health Board on its own account brought 
to the United States as its guests health officials and scien-

207, Europe 472, the East 185; by countries: Germany 
270 (262 small emergency grants), United States 164, China 
(including small grants to Chinese and missionary doctors 
in China) 152, Poland 45, Yugoslavia 36, Hungary 33, 
Brazil 21, Czechoslovakia 21, Canada 16, Austria 13, Ru-

lands 4, Spain 3, Costa Rica 2, Hongkong 2, and Mexico, 
Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Denmark, Italy (through theLeague 
of Nations), Australia, Java, Syria, one each. It will be 
noted that this distribution reflects the relations between the 
Foundation and projects which are being aided in different 
parts of the world. Of the 864 fellows 281 crossed national 
borders to work in foreign countries. The total amount 
spent upon fellowships for the year was $585,148. The 
total number of fellowships directly or indirectly supported 
from 1916 to January, 1925, was 1,472. 
TIDING OVER A CRISIS IN THE MEDICAL 
SCIENCES 
The “resident fellowships’ which have just been reported 
need a few words of explanation. Those established in 
Europe (this does not hold true in China) were created origi- 
nally as an emergency measure. There seemed to be danger, 
especially in Germany, of a break in the continuity of scien-

tific work which was of value to the whole world. So it was 
decided to set up a committee of German medical scientists 
who should select for assistance within limits younger persons 
likely to turn to good account allowances which would enable 
them to continue their scientific careers. Fortunately during 
1924 conditions in Germany improved so much that the need 
of continuing this emergency aid seems likely from now on 
to grow rapidly less. Resident fellowships, however, will be 
: used here- 
after to as- 
sist indivi- 
duals to do 
advanced 
workin their 
own coun- 
tries. These

abroad which 
will permit them to study wherever the best appropriate 
training is to be had. 
These small stipends to promising persons were part of a 
plan of emergency aid which included also grants for labora- 
tory apparatus and supplies and for scientific periodicals anda 
small number of books. At the close of the war many con- 
tinental medical schools, especially in Central and Eastern 
Europe, were in serious straits. They needed to be tided 
over a crisis. The Foundation extended its policy to include 
emergency aid for this purpose. With improving conditions

FIELD SERVICE 41 
this form of help will soon come to an end. During 1924 
emergency contributions were made to 88 institutions in 16 
European countries, not including Germany. 
CONSULTATION AND FIELD SERVICE 
Advice from a well-trained and experienced specialist can 
sometimes do more good than a gift of money. The loan of 
an expert to a health department or to a medical school may 
insure the more efficient use of funds which are already avail- 
able, or small temporary appropriations may help to establish 
new forms of service which will make convincing appeals for 
government or institutional support. 
During 1924 the International Health Board, by the loan 
of experts and by small grants, helped to improve public 
health laboratory service in 10 states of the United States and 
in seven foreign countries. In the same way aid with respect 
to disease reporting, sanitary engineering, or vital statistics 
was rendered to seven American states and to four health 
departments abroad. The General Director and other offi- 
cers made tours of survey and inspection in the United 
States, Europe, and the Far East. The visits of representa- 
tives of the Division of Medical Education to medical schools 
in many countries have already been mentioned. 
The Division of Studies sent a well-known anthropologist 
to Australasia to make a preliminary inquiry and to report 
upon the feasibility of an intensive study of primitive peoples 
in Australia. The same division continued surveys of nurs- 
ing education in Europe. The China Medical Board (1) lent 
consultants in premedical education, (2) maintained an archi- 
tectural bureau which gave advice about laboratory and 
hospital construction, (3) helped hospitals to select and instal 
X-ray equipment, (4) contributed toward the translation of 
modern medical books into Chinese, and (5) helped to estab- 
lish a biological supply bureau which should gather material 
for use in biological courses and distribute it to schools and 
colleges.

  42 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
WORKING THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES 
It is a policy of the Rockefeller Foundation not to set up 
unnecessary machinery but to work with and through certain 
agencies which are equipped to do work in public health, 
medical education, and related fields. There follows a list of 
the organizations to which the Rockefeller Foundation made 
payments in 1924: 
Medical Research Council (Great Britain). Fellowships for 
young British doctors to work in the United States. 
The National Research Council. Fellowships in mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. 
New York Committee on Dispensary Development. Im- 
provements and demonstrations in out-patient services. 
American Conference on Hospital Service. Contribution to 
hospital library and information bureau. 
Union of American Biological Societies. Expenses to 
Europe of representatives; limited underwriting of abstract 
journal. 
National Committee for Mental Hygiene. Surveys of 
mental deficiency, uniform statistics, fellowships. 
Canadian Committee for Mental Hygiene. Applications of 
mental hygiene to school children; fellowships. 
New York Academy of Medicine. Contributions toward 
educational work, pending payment of promised endowment. 
American Medical Association. One half the deficit of 
Spanish Edition of Journal of American Medical Association. 
National Health Council. Final payment toward experi- 
ment in team-work among voluntary health agencies. 
Council on Health Education (China). General budget; 
promotion of interest in modern medicine. 
China Medical Missionary Association. Current expenses; 
maintenance of standards of medical education. 
National Medical Association of China. Expenses of 
Committee on Uniform Medical Terminology in Chinese. 
National Educational Reform Association of China. Salary 
of special supervisor and investigator for government 
schools.
-P-A-G-E-43
  “APPLICATIONS 43 
North China Union Language School. Appropriation to- 
ward new building. 
New York Association for Improving the Condition of the 
Poor, and Committee of Reference and Counsel. Final pay- 
ments on ten-year pledges made in 1914. 
APPLICATIONS FOR AID 
In 1924, formal applications for aid to the number of 622 
were declined. Besides these many tentative requests were 
made both to the central office and to staff members in the 
field. The 622 applications fell into the following groups: 
public health 29, medical education 148, general education 
52, local institutions 120, personal aid 194, miscellaneous 79. 
The requests were not granted because they did not fall 
within the scope of policies which at present govern the work 
of the Foundation. The trustees decline to make gifts or 
loans to individuals, to contribute to the building or main- 
tenance of churches, hospitals (except as certain hospital 
features may be included in plans for medical education), 
and other local institutions, or to support campaigns to 
influence public opinion on social or political questions. A 
record of all applications formally declined is kept and they 
are regularly reported to the trustees. From considerations 
of courtesy and fairness the names of applicants and the 
details of their requests are not made public. 
SERVANT OF A COMMON CAUSE 
This summary story of a year’s activity records co- 
operation with 32 commonwealths of the United States of 
America and with 77 other states and countries. Now and 
then someone has asked whether such aid from without does 
not imply a kind of condescension; whether the Foundation 
does not seem to covet the réle of a corporate Maecenas of 
medicine. The answer is that the very nature of the work 
precludes a feeling of Chauvinism and of patronage. To 
visit many countries, to note the things in which each 
excels, to meet men and women who are contributing to the
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION 
world’s store of scientific knowledge and skill, to learn of their 
plans and needs, to make easier the migrations and inter- 
changes of scientists, to facilitate that commerce of ideas 
which enriches all lands—to have a share in all these things 
is to realize that scientific progress, the development of 
education, the fostering of the fine arts, are not the work of 
one country or race but of continuous international inter- 
course. The Rockefeller Foundation within its chosen field 
seeks to share in this common task as a means of realizing the 
purpose of its charter, “the well-being of mankind through- 
out the world.” 
FINANCES FOR 1924 
The accompanying table presents.a summary of receipts 
and expenditures for 1924. The income accruing from in- 
vestments was a little more than eight millions. Of this 
$7,288,823 was needed to meet the obligations which came 
due during the year. Of the $6,704,504 carried over from 
1923, $6,530,048 was subject to call in fulfilment of out- 
standing pledges. The remainder available for transfer to 
the 1925 budget and subject to appropriations for that year 
was $1,077,144. Details of expenditure for 1924 will be 
found on pages 45 and 46 of this Review. A still fuller financial 
statement will appear in the Annual Report for 1924 to 
appear later in the year. A copy will be sent to anyone who 
applies for it.

Dear Bors anp Girts: 
Some of the songs in this new book which we have planned 
especially for you, will be sung by your teacher, for you to learn 
by hearing. We know that you will enjoy them.. We also know 
that you will enjoy the songs that are to be learned by reading 
the notes, just as you read the words in stories. Use your eyes 
and brains as well-as your ears, and you will see what fun it is to 
find a lovely melody in a row of black notes printed on a page. 
  We hope that you have a phonograph in your school, and that 
on some days you will have listening lessons, for one of the impor- 
tant things that we all need to learn is to sit quietly and listen 
intelligently to music that other people are singing or playing. 
There are two things about singing that you should always 
remember: (1) Every song tells a story or expresses an emotion, 
and in order to sing any song well you must be thinking about the 
story as you sing: (2) Music should be so beautiful that people 
will want to listen to it; so you should try to make your voice 
sound as smooth and velvety as possible. In other words, always 
sing the songs: never shout them. If you will remember to apply 
these two things you will enjoy your own singing and other people 
will like to listen to you: 
Did you every, hear the story of Orpheus? He played on his 
lute and sang so beautifully that the wind stopped blowing, and the 
trees stopped rustling and the very mountain tops bent low to 
listen. Think how it would sound if each of you tried to sing like 
Orpheus. : 
Your Friends, 
Tue Eprrors.

THE UNIVERSAL 
SCHOOL MUSIC SERIES 
FOREWORD 
The editors of these books realize that very few children 
become professional musicians. For the great majority, music 
study is to be justified primarily as an important factor in 
making human life more satisfying. Music is taught for the 
sake of the joy and satisfaction which it brings into the lives of 
‘the many; not merely as a means of enabling the few to re- 
ceive professional training. A series of books to be used by 
all the children of all the people must therefore stress that 
side of music which results immediately in zsthetic pleasure 
rather than that which concerns itself only with elaborate 
technical training in preparation for future achievements and 
enjoyments. In short, we must give the children, abundantly,. 
while they are still in school, the joyful experience of hearing, 
and sharing in the rendition of beautiful music. Accordingly 
we have emphasized, throughout the series, song-singing and 
listening lessons, with “music appreciation” as the general 
objective. The abundance of music of high quality which 
these books contain is perhaps their most distinctive feature, 
and we hope that through singing this music our children 
will come to love music because it is beautiful, satisfying, 
and exalting.. In thus learning to appreciate and to love 
beautiful music, we believe that our boys and girls will be 
inclined to observe and to acquire a taste for all beauty. | Such 
stimulation of the children’s zsthetic instincts will in turn 
tend to enrich, refine and ennoble their entire lives, thus 
amply justifying the time devoted to music. .

Note.—The sharps or flats at the beginning of the staff are called the ‘‘Key-Signature.” 
They are collected at the beginning of the staff in this way so as to make it unnecessary, con- 
tiuually to insert sharps and flats in the various measures of.the music. 1¢ is understood that 
when a # is placed on the fifth line not only this particular “F” but the one on the firat-space 
and any others that may be used in writing on added lines are all changed to “F-sharp.” This 
is only true in the-case of the signature sharp and flat and does not.apply to any extra sharps 
or flats that may occur in the course of the composition. Be very careful always to refer to the 
degrees of the staff vy their correct names. If there are two flats in the signature, for example, 
- do not call the third tine “BY but “B-flat.” What would be the name of the first line in this cage?

‘Note.—Have you ever thought of just what the clef is for? The G clef is a sign which tells 
us that the second line of the staff is “G” (the first “G” above “Middle C” on the piano). If 
we know the seven letters of the musical alphabet (a, b, c, d, e, f, g) we can easily figure out 
the names of the other lines and spaces. The firat- space, for example, will be ““F” because F 
comes before G, and the first line will be “E” because E comes just before F. The second 
space will be ‘‘A” because there are only seven letters in the musical alphabet and when we. 
have used all seven we start all-over again. What is the letter name (or pitch name, as it is 
called) of the first added line above the staff? If you have a good head and wse it you can find out.

Note.—Two children are selected to play the parts. The little girl sings the first half of 
the verse and the little boy the second half. When he says, he has no coat to put on, she 
lorrows one from some other one of the children, and se on for each verse. The last verse, 
which is sung by the soldier alone, always creates great merriment. After the 5th verse omit 
the chorus.

  Note.—You have known for a long time what sharps and flats are but have you ever thought 
of just what they are for? A # on a line or space makes it stand for a higher tone and also 
changes its name. The name of the fifth line, for example, is “‘F” but if a # is written on the 
line its name changes to ‘F-sharp” and it stands for a'tone a “half-step” higher. On the piano 
this meatis the next key to the Fight (black or ‘white). “In the same way a Bon a line or space 
“makes if stand for a lower tone. If, thereforé, a flat is written on the first line the name of 
that line changes from “‘E” to ‘E-Flat,” that is; it stands for a tone, a ‘“‘half-step” lower—the

Foreword 
HE fundamental theory of the teaching of Music in the Primary 
Grades is that Music is for all children and should be within the 
teaching ability of every teacher. 
Interest and spontaneity on the part of both teacher and pupils are 
the absolute essentials of successful primary singing. Obviously these 
qualities are within the reach of every teacher. It should be as natural 
for a child: to sing as it is for him to laugh. His joy of living, his sense 
of companionship find natural utterance in simple songs. 
The song, therefore, should be the basis for instruction from the first 
lesson in the kindergarten to the last lesson given to the normal school 
graduate just entering upon her duties as a teacher. By teaching pupils 
of any grade a number of beautiful songs, a center of interest in Music 
is established upon which may be developed the more formal side of 
music instruction. When love for thé song is firmly rooted in the child’s 
heart and his interest is keen, is the time to begin the more formal 
interpretation of the rudiments of Music. . 
The “Bentley Song Series” covers the work of the Primary Grades, 
One to Four inclusive. The ‘Song Primer’ is a Teacher’s Handbook. 
It is to be used by the teacher in the First grade to teach the songs 
by rote to the children. In the Second Grade, with Book II of the series 
in the hands of the children, the teacher will find in the “Song Primer” 
specific teaching plans for each song, with many piano accompaniments 
charmingly arranged. In the Second Grade the child thus learns to 
read by sight the songs he learned ‘to sing by rote in the First Grade. 
The “Song Primer’’ also furnishes a plan of presentation for the work 
in the Third and Fourth Grades, and should be in the hands of every 
teacher conducting the Music work. 
The ‘Bentley Song Series” is a collection of songs inspired by many 
years observance of what children need and love to express, and they are 
’ written entirely from the point of view of the child. Every song in each 
book has been tested in lower grade classes; its value as a rote or study 
sorig has been established by actual experiment. These, then, are not 
the songs which children may or ought to love to sing, but they are the 
songs which children delight in, and from the singing of which they get 
the largest spontaneous participation of body, mind and spirit. 
It is from such an early musical experience that they will develop a 
liking for music, an appreciation of music, and an ability to take part in 
group singing. Interest, Appreciation, Participation—these are the 
qualities which the ‘‘Bentley Song Series” develops in the primary music 
course and which will carry over into the life of the child.

PREFACE. 
GENERALLY this book has been planned as a sort of “ guide ” 
and to place before the teacher suitable objects sufficiently 
interesting for the training of infants in observation and 
handwork. Even in the teaching of children so young we 
need a basis of training, and I doubt if any of our methods 
is so generally fitted for the purpose of educating the hand 
the eye, and the mind, as. this one of Modelling. Actual 
technical skill wili not be looked for, but it is possible to 
set too low an estimate on this subject for elementary 
teachers and pupils; and, although there is still a call for 
ready-made lessons, the teacher soon discovers that such 
cannot produce the best results. Herein are suggestions, 
but true success can only arise from the personality and 
taste of the teacher to infuse original ideas into the work to 
suit class requirements, and so arouse that interest which 
is of first importance in the teaching of infants.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. 
CHAPTER I. 
INTRODUCTION. 
WITHIN the last two decades various theories concerning the 
beginnings of education have undergone radical changes. In the 
main these changes are due to research and discovery in the domain 
of Child Psychology. In sympathy with these newer theories our 
methods of practice have likewise changed. Abstractions and 
memory exercises, which were at one time thought indispensable, 
have now been largely consigned to the limbo of the past, and 
replaced by the concrete, the real, the actual; the experience and 
knowledge gained therefrom are ‘assuredly far more accurate and 
enduring, and, to that extent therefore, more valuable, than that 
acquired by the former methods. 
To no subject taught in our schools do the above remarks apply 
more appositely than to Handwork. _Cla ~aS.a. 
of instruction for infants, is a. beginning.of. Handwork. The increased 
‘importance which Handwork has assumed in mind-building compels 
the attention of educationisty to that primary, fundamental instru- 
ment—the human hand:”"The'strorgly-marked artificial character 
of our lives under modern ultra-civilised conditions renders it 
more than ever necessary that the hand and eye should, from the 
earliest years of infancy, have as free play as possible, and thus 
receive at least some of the training which,in less constrained 
circumstances, they would acquire naturally and unconsciously, 
Now many children of the present day are, or have been till quite 
recently, absolutely debarred from some of the ordinary time- 
honoured pursuits and amusements natural to childhood, and the 
educational loss has been appreciable. The exigencies of our 
modern notions of cleanliness demand, for mstance, that the 
1
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 CLAY MODELLING FOR INFANTS. 
luxury of making “‘ mud-pies ”’ should be withheld ; and for many 
children the only time when such pursuits are allowed is the brief 
(all too brief in many instances !) yearly seaside holiday, when the 
making of sand castles, forts, houses, canals, and lakes provides an 
occupation of engrossing fascination for those fortunate youngsters 
who are able to indulge in it. 
But sand, admirably clean though it is, has not the educational 
advantages of mud. Its general lack of coherence and its excessive 
friability induce size rather than delicacy, and so limit the scope 
of its utility. The tips of the fingers, in which liesfie most sensitive 
nerves of touch, are scarcely brought into play.V The range of form 
capable of illustration and reproduction is much greater with mud 
than with sand, and the former has undoubtedly provided from time 
immemorial the natural material the child has used to gain and 
increase that sensibility of touch and appreciation of form, which 
are the peculiar birthright of the hand and the prerogative of the 
mind. | 
Without some such initial training, the hand suffers when sub- 
sequently introduced to the use of any tool; and it is to form a 
sanitary substitute and furnish this training that the use of clay 
comes in. Tools of all kinds have a fascination for children, but 
a tool is not always safe unless the child possesses, first, some 
elementary deftness of touch. 
Clay, or any of its substitutes (even mud or putty), is a material 
e manipulation requires the use of no tool other than the 
hand, | has E ~™ The fruition of the sculptor’s idea owes far more to the easy 
manipulation of the plastic clay with which he first fixed it than 
to the marble in which it was finally embodied. It is a question 
whether it ever would have been permanently fixed without the 
pliable clay. 
With clay, the fingers and palms alone will do all that is necessary. 
Consequently they require the maximum of exercise and training 
without the narrowing effect which the use of single tools entails. 
The _possibilities_in_the human, untrained hand, though latent, 
are practically infinite, its sensibility being capable of almost endless © 
extension if properly-exereised-and developed. The sense of touch underlies and.makes-possible_all our ideas of form. The germina- 
tion of all ideas is of the utmost importance;~the usefulness in 
infant education of such a medium as clay is self-evident. As the 
simplest form of handwork, elementary clay modelling is the 
natural foundation of all the more complex forms which require the 
use of mechanical-tools-; to say nothing “of its power of developing 
and influencing the mind through the sense of touch—a matter 
of even greater importance.
-P-A-G-E-15
    
  INTRODUCTION. 3 
Thus, no time spent even in such apparently trivial occupations 
as the making of ‘‘ mud-pies”’ can be deemed educationally wasted. 
The sense of touch the fingers acquire, the strength gained by the 
muscles of the hands, and the facility, subsequently, with which 
bothware used, are all qualities of abiding value not merely in the 
use of tools, but in almost every other manual action of our lives, 
Of even greater permanence and value are the ideas of concrete 
form the mind receives, the creative impulse fostered thereby, 
and the mental exercise such creation involves. The instinctive 
joy of “‘ making something ”’ awakens and stirs the imagination 
in a way that mere words can perhaps never approach. By means 
of it the illustration of a fairy tale, an historical incident, or a 
geographical fact, impresses the same almost indelibly on the 
mind, stimulating at the same time the imagination and giving free 
play to the simultaneous use of the hand and the eye. 
_The idea.thatthe clay_is to be a medium.for.the. piece a 
the child’s artistic sense, or for its training, is a little beside the 
questions "Certainly this specific and secondary consideration 
~shotld not be lost sight of, but the rimar be to give 
dexterity to the fingers, sensibili 
to the muscles, besides imparting more de nite 1deas of form than    
  mere fj ng 5L-ordinary-objects- vould produce. 
The dameniaty acts of of nipping, squeezing, patting, pressing,. 
pulling, grasping, and handling generally are all that are really 
- neécessary~at-first; the response of the plastic clay being so ready ; 
and ideas of form are rapidly increased by the multitude of.shapes 
the clay may be so easily made to assume, 
The interest it excites gives good training in the concentration 
of mind-of which it is so necessary for-all-to acquire the habit if 
any successful work is to be accomplished. This in itself is indis- 
pensable before any definite training in the purely formal art 
processes can be attempted. 
Nor should the purely technical side of the manipulation of clay 
be too much emphasised. Clay Modelling is often spoken of as 
a building-up process, t.e., each form should be gradually built 
up by the addition of more material to that already existing, and _ 
it is insisted on that this process should be rigidly followed. This 
is a ‘mistake. With adults, yes! with infants, certainly not! 
Clay Modelling for Infants is an elementary introductory process, 
used so that ideas of form may be easily conveyed and exercise 
given, as already described. Why tie the children down to one 
process, that of addition ? Is building-up the only process clay is 
susceptible of ? As time goes on, and the child becomes stronger in 
mind, other materials will be introduced to its notice. 4m dealing 
with these other materials, will the process be always the same ?
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 CLAY MODELLING FOR INFANTS. 
There are such operations as carving, bending, hammering. 
chasing, etc., each demanding handwork and involving alteration 
of form. Why not exemplify as many as possible with the clay ? 
Even the clay slab so often recommended is not really necessary 
with infants. The making of one each lesson is a repetition of the 
same process which tends to take up time that could be more profit- 
ably spent on more varied forms. Not that there is any great 
harm in doing it, but infants soon tire of repetition, and the effort 
expended on the slab is so much loss to the real lesson. 
The low relief work often attempted by teachers with infants 
should, in the writer’s opinion, be left alone. Later on it may per- 
haps be touched with safety, though the esthetic and decorative 
features it implies are such as few teachers are capable of attacking 
satisfactorily themselves. The flattening of the planes and. the 
subtle alteration of surface-forms necessary for even very elementary 
work require artistic discrimination added to a sound knowledge 
of form. 
It is the latter that should be chiefly aimed at, by making, tf 
possible, everything in the round. Where children begin to present 
things in relief of their own initiative, they of course should not 
be prevented, but it is not desirable to prescribe such exercises 
to a class of infants, | 
Be it well understood, however, that too hard and fast methods 
of representation should not be imposed upon the child: he should 
be encouraged to present a form according to his own conception 
of it. In this volume there are a number of examples given, indi- 
cating methods of procedure which will render the construction 
of complete objects simpler. These must be used with discretion, 
so as not to hamper the exercise and growth of the child’s 
self-expression.
-P-A-G-E-17
CHAPTER II. 
CLAY: HOW TO USE IT TO THE BEST 
ADVANTAGE. 
THE clay generally used differs in character somewhat from the 
ordinary brown or red clay, such as is used in the making of bricks, 
being as a rule of a whitish, warm gray colour, and less greasy when 
mixed with water. It is known as pipe-clay, and is mostly pro- 
cured from Devonshire ; it has to go through a few processes before 
being used for its specific purpose. A fair proportion of fine silver 
sand, fot instance, must be mixed with it before its original greasy 
nature is overcome. Hard foreign substances, such as stones, grit, 
etc., are previously carefully eliminated. As supplied to the user 
by the manufacturer, it is generally quite ready for use. Its cost 
is from 3s. a cwt., damp; it can also be obtained as a dry powder. 
HOW TO KEEP AND STORE THE CLAY. 
An air-tight zinc-lined box is the best to keep it in, and it should 
be occasionally sprayed with water and stirred or kneaded with a 
shovel or trowel kept specially for the purpose. Small quantities, if 
well wrapped in damp flannel and American cloth, will keep moist 
and plastic for a considerable time. There is an ideal condition 
for use, for if too wet it sticks to the fingers, and if too dry, it is 
short and brittle, being then quite unworkable. There is a golden 
mean between these two states. 
HINTS AND WARNINGS. 
(1) Clay, when not in use, should never be held in the hand, for 
it rapidly loses its moisture and becomes unworkable. To moisten 
it again is a tiresome business after it has been given out to a class. 
If laid aside it will remain moist and be in a good condition for use 
the whole time of the lesson. 
(2) If given out a little too wet the warmth of the hand soon 
reduces it to its proper condition. After this, of course, it should 
be retained in the hand only as long as necessary. 
(3) A little oil on the fingers prevents clay from adhering to them. 
(4) If the clay has been allowed to become a hard solid lump the 
best way to restore it is to break it up carefully into pieces of about 
5
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 CLAY MODELLING FOR INFANTS. 
the size of a walnut, then to enclose the whole in a bag and allow it 
thoroughly to absorb moisture ; it can then be easily manipulated 
by the hand until its original consistency is restored. 
(5) It is needless, of course, to mention that any of the substitutes 
for clay now on the market, such as Plasticine, Pate-d-modeler, and 
Ever-Plastic Clay, can of course be used where expense is not a 
consideration. For many elementary school purposes, they are 
perhaps superior to the ordinary modelling clay. 
(6) Prolonged working with clay will sometimes cause the skin of 
the hands to assume a crinkled appearance, and look rather as they 
do after they have been immersed in strong soap and water for a 
length of time. A little glycerine or vaseline rubbed on them ~ 
after they have been washed and dried will do much to remove this. 
The small quantity of clay given to the children and the limited 
time during which it is in use are, however, hardly likely to cause 
them any inconvenience of this kind. Should wet clay soil the 
clothes, it should be allowed to dry and then be brushed off. 
APPARATUS FOR CLASS USE. 
An ordinary school slate, if one can be found in any school 
nowadays, does excellently as a foundation on which the clay may 
be laid. Whereslates have been already relegated to the stock room 
as obsolete, this will be an excellent way of making use of them 
again. If no slates are available, a piece of American cloth of 
suitable size, say 12” by 12”, may be given out to each child. This 
has the merit of being easily stored and cleaned. The bare desk 
should never be used. Habits of tidiness should be insisted on, 
special care being taken that no clay is allowed to drop on the floor ; 
for when dry and trodden in it forms a highly objectionable dust,
-P-A-G-E-19
  CHAPTER III. 
HOW TO BEGIN TO TEACH CLAY MODELLING. 
WITH the very youngest children a formal set lesson in modelling 
is all but impossible, and it is just as well that it should be so. In 
whatever form work of this kind is taken, it should follow naturally 
after some other lesson and take almost a recreative turn ; in fact, 
be “‘ play with clay.” Even if, owing to the immaturity of the 
child-mind, no particular form is evolved, the preliminary handling, 
feeling, pressing, nipping, squeezing, etc., which the child naturally 
will give it (for all, without exception, will do this when first given 
a piece of clay), will fulfil certain functions, and give the hand a 
certain form of exercise that is beneficial to it. A child’s curiosity as 
to its “‘ feel’’ must be first satisfied. It may need several experiences 
of the clay before this happens. Then, and not before, something 
may bedone. The child may be encouraged to make whatever takes 
its fancy. Technical difficulties at this stage have no terrors. The 
crudest result will satisty its sense of form. Some are so crude as 
to be totally unrecognisable by the adult, but seem to satisfy the 
child. All attempts to hasten his sense of form will be futile. He 
must be left to work in his own way. Utter freedom must be given 
in these elementary processes. Even suggestions by the teacher 
will be found of little use. 
After the recital of a fairy tale, some object, animal, building, etc., 
may be modelled in clay. If time allows, several may be done, and 
the whole grouped into one scene. As before stated, no matter 
how crude the form evolved, it will do at this stage. The great 
thing is to give practice in handling the clay, thereby not only 
exercising the fingers, but also giving play to the imagination, for 
the child, as it proceeds, lingers lovingly over the details of the 
story, investing each shapeless object in clay with the attributes 
of the actors or “ properties’ of the story. 
But when we deal with rather older infants, more correctness 
may be looked for. As the teacher brings in objects and details 
of actual life, which can be seen and handled, he may require them 
to be modelled with much greater exactness and with much more 
detail, either direct from nature, or, occasionally, from memory, 
where it may be difficult to get the object and to place it before 
the pupils. Suggestions by the teacher will be found helpful and 
will be followed by the child. Methods tending to secure the result 
7 
2—(1020)
-P-A-G-E-20
8 CLAY MODELLING FOR INFANTS. 
more quickly will begin to be appreciated; still, however, the 
lessons should be correlated, in as natural a manner as possible, 
to other subjects in the curriculum, and great freedom—even 
latitude—should be allowed to the child as to the manner in which 
to attain his object. 
After a course of two years of the kind advocated above, when 
greater experience has been acquired and a certain maturity of mind 
attained, the set lesson on some particular form may be given. But 
it is imperative that this should not be done in the dry “ bare- 
bones ”’ way so often met with. Such geometrical objects as globes, 
cubes, prisms, etc., are anathema to the child-mind, but disguised 
in the form of cricket balls or footballs, boxes, fruit, etc., the same 
result is obtained in a much more interesting and pleasurable form. 
The order here given need not be adhered to, but the lessons should 
be taken as occasion for them arises. No good teacher would follow 
slavishly anyone’s system ; indeed, no two teachers, even if of equal 
calibre, would be found to follow the same course. Conditions, 
due to attainments and environment differ so greatly that any 
common course is out of the question. 
The primary ideas which the teacher should ever keep in view are 
the building up of the mind and the training of the sense of touch. 
As to gradation of models teachers should be sufficiently experi- 
enced to be able to use their own judgment in the selection of suitable 
objects for successive lessons. This experience may easily be 
gained by a little preliminary practice on their own part. 
In every lesson, except on rare occasions, actual objects should be 
placed before the children for close observation. 
The instructions in method given in the subsequent remarks 
are for the teacher’s guidance only.

SECTION I. 
TOYS. 
MODELLING A BALL. 
(PLATE I.) 
THERE is perhaps little need for any directions for modelling this 
article, as, instinctively, one of the first actions of a child when 
handling a soft piece of clay is to work it between his two hands 
until it assumes a globular shape. Attention should be directed 
towards making it as round as possible. More exercise is given 
to the muscles of the hand and arm than to the fingers in working 
this exercise, but it certainly seems the most natural thing in the 
world for a child to start with. 
The globular shape having been attained, a line may be scratched 
round the ball with a piece of wood, the pencil point, or a burnt 
match, and indentations made to represent the stitches. This will 
give exercise to the fingers. It is not very likely that it will be very 
accurately done at first, but the attempt should be made. 
If time allows, more clay may be added, and then, by renewed 
woiking between the palms of the hands, the representation of a 
football may be obtained. The same tools, a pencil or burnt match 
may afterwards be used to complete its appearance by scratching 
the requisite markings. (Most schools possess a football which can 
be requisitioned as a model.) 
This may again be changed by working it between the palms 
until an ellipsoidal shape is given to it (a Rugby football), and the 
characteristic markings may be similarly added. There is enough 
scope in the above for two lessons. For the last two models a larger 
amount of clay should be distributed to each child so as to emphasise 
the difference in scale. In each case sufficient should be given out 
to make it necessary for the palms of the hands to be used, otherwise 
it will be done with the fingers only.

MODELLING A TOP. 
(PLATE II.) 
Two balls of clay are made, one about twice the size of the other. 
The two are fixed together, and the whole is then moulded in the 
hand until the correct top shape is obtained. 
The flutings for the cord are formed by lines marked round the 
object with a match or the point of a pencil. A hole can be also 
made with the pencil for the insertion of the peg. This is separately 
modelled in the form of a small cylinder of clay and inserted 
afterwards.

SECTION II. 
A DRAPER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A BUTTON. 
(PratE III.) 
THE common bone type can easily be made from a small ball of 
clay. This is laid on the support and pressed with the ball of the 
finger. The finger is worked gently round so as to form the depres- 
sion-at the top. The original circular shape must not, however, 
be lost. The holes may be made with the point of a pencil. 
MODELLING A REEL OR BOBBIN. 
(PLATE III.) 
A cylinder of clay is first made. By revolving between the 
fingers and gently pressing, the flanges can be shown. A pencil 
will easily make the hole commonly seen throughout its length. 
MODELLING A ROLL OF CLOTH. 
(PLateE III.) 
A rectangular piece of clay is first made according to the pro- 
portions of the model. The edges are then slightly rounded. A flat 
piece of clay is added to the top and the join is smoothed over. 
The two ends are then scratched to show the rolling of the cloth. 
The roll, of course, may in some cases be cylindrical.

A BAKER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A BUN. 
(PLATE IV.) 
AFTER forming the lump of clay into a globe, as advised for the 
ball, it may be laid down on the slate or cloth and gently pressed 
with the palm of the hand. By this means it is made to assume 
the required bun shape. Markings, or little pieces of clay, may be 
added on the upper surface to represent the currants. 
MODELLING A SCONE. 
(PLATE IV.) 
A larger piece of clay, shaped similarly to the above but con- 
siderably flatter, is first made. The characteristic cross on the top 
can then be made with the finger tip. Considerable pressure may 
have to be used to effect this, using the finger sideways so that 
the tip incises the clay somewhat. Four scones are made in this way. 
MODELLING A COTTAGE LOAF OF BREAD. 
(PLATE IV.) 
Divide the clay into two parts, one rather larger than the other. 
Take the larger piece and roll it first into a globular shape; then 
gently press it down to represent the lower half of the loaf. This 
is left on the slate while the smaller piece of clay 1s manipulated 
into the shape of the top. The depression at the top can be repre- 
sented by a hole made with the tip of the finger, working it round 
until the proper depth is obtained. The top is then fixed to the 
lower part by gentle pressure. Afterwards the rather irregular 
characteristic shape is attained by gentle pats here and there. 
MODELLING A TINNED LOAF. 
The shape of this article may be obtained by using two rulers, 
or two other flat pieces of wood, and gradually patting the clay 
into shape, much in the same way as a provision-dealer pats a pound 
of butter. The lower portion may have sloping sides or they may 
be vertical. When this is done more clay may have to be added 
to form the top, which is afterwards rounded off with the fingers. 
Different children may have different ideas of the shape of this 
object. Individual preference should be allowed. 
Representations of slices of bread may easily be made by the 
same means as above, or by using the fingers and hands only. These 
slices may, of course, be of various shapes.

MODELLING A TART. 
(PLATE V.) 
Divide the clay into two portions, one much larger than the 
other. The larger portion is then fashioned between the fingers 
into the shape of the lower part of the tart, viz., somewhat like a 
small, deep saucer. The edges may be fashioned into any required 
shape by nipping with fingers, or they may be indented with the 
finger tip, or a pattern of some kind may be scratched round them 
as the fancy of the child directs. The small portion of the clay is 
then made to represent the jam, etc., in the centre of the tart, and 
gently pressed into position. Further ornamentation may be given 
by placing small strips of clay across the part representing the jam. 
MODELLING A PIE. 
(PLATE V.) 
A dish, preferably flat, having been previously modelled, may be 
filled with lumps of clay of various sizes to represent the meat, 
fruit, etc., of the interior, and thin slabs of clay, flattened on the 
slate or cloth, laid on to represent the crust. The hole at the top 
for the emission of steam may be formed by pressure with the 
finger-tip ; and the whole may then be ornamented by adding 
strips of clay, indenting with the fingers, or scratching with a piece 
of wood, as the fancy of the child directs. 
All of these are pleasing exercises for children, giving scope not 
merely for exercise of the fingers, but for that of the memory also, 
as most of them will try to copy something they have seen their 
mothers make. 
MODELLING A CAKE. 
(PLATE V.) 
The cake illustrated is perhaps of as common a shape as any, 
but modifications of course are allowable. 
A flat cylinder of clay is first made. Additions of clay are then 
placed on top so as to form the hemispherical shape found there. 
Too much attention need not be paid to perfecting the top, for a 
certain degree of irregularity will better show the appearance cakes 
usually present. The lemon pee] usually seen may be represented 
if thought desirable.

SECTION IV. 
A GROCER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A PACKET OF TEA. 
(PLATE VI.) 
AN actual packet of about the required proportions will serve as a 
model. 
The square prism shape is first obtained. Two flat triangular 
slabs of clay are then affixed in their places at each end as seen in 
the illustration, so as to suggest the folded ends of the wrapping 
paper ; these must be well pressed on to the prism and the joins 
smoothed over. 
The string can be shown by very thin cylinders of clay fixed 
round the packet, or a groove may be made with the pointed end 
of a pencil. 
MODELLING A PAT OF BUTTER. 
(PLATE VI.) 
This can either be built up, or be patted into shape with two 
rulers in the same way as the provision dealer does. 
Grooves may be made along the top with the edge of a ruler, and 
a pattern should be fastened to it. The one in the illustration is 
a clover leaf, 
MODELLING A PACKET OF SUGAR. 
(PLATE VI.) 
A cone of clay of the right size and proportions is first made. The 
pointed end is nipped in the finger and the clay twisted round 
slightly. Two triangles (flat thin slabs of clay) are then fastened 
to the top and bent over so as to suggest the turning-in of the 
paper.

MODELLING A CHEESE. 
(PLaTE VII.) 
These are interesting and easy exercises on various common 
geometric shapes, 
The Stilton cheese may be first modelled, being a simple cylinder 
of clay. The children may be shown how it is usually cut, and 
allowed to cut their own models similarly. 
The Cheshire cheese is another cylinder of clay but shorter and 
wider. This may also be cut by the children: a ruler will make 
a satisfactory knife. 
The Dutch cheese is first modelled as a flatter and smaller cylinder. 
The edges are then rounded off into the typical shape. This again 
may be cut. A pound of cheese (the usual wedge-shaped piece) | 
may also be given as an exercise.

MODELLING A PIECE OF BACON. 
(PLaTE VIII.) 
Pieces of bacon naturally vary greatly in shape according to the 
part of the animal from which they are cut. The shape given in 
the illustration is perhaps the one children are most likely to be 
acquainted with. 
A rough triangular slab is first prepared, modelling it approx- 
imately into the main shape. The apex is then cut away, and the 
whole is bent into the curved shape necessary. Various markings, 
showing the bones, etc., can then be made with the fingers but 
care must be taken that the main shape is not lost. 
Different children will of course show different shapes, chiefly 
according to the different joints or cuts they are accustomed to 
see at home.

SECTION V. 
A BUTCHER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A MUTTON CHOP. 
(PLATE IX.) 
THE typical shape of a chop is somewhat difficult to describe 
in words, so the reader is referred to the illustration. A flat, 
triangular slab of clay of the proper thickness is first modelled. 
A lump of clay is added to one corner to express the protuberance 
of the vertebra. 
Pressure and working with the finger then produce this requisite 
shape. The curve of the rib-bone, as apart from the meat, should 
be noted carefully. 
MODELLING A LEG OF MUTTON. 
(PLATE IX.) 
This characteristic shape is obtained by first modelling a conical 
mass and then rounding off the base. The whole should then be 
flattened a little. Additions here and there will be required to give 
it character, especially where the bones project. Too much detail, 
however, should not be indicated; if the typical leg-of-mutton 
shape is attained, that is quite as much as can be expected.

SECTION VI. 
A FISHMONGER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A SPRAT. 
(PLATE X.) 
TAké a roll of clay and fashion it into the shape of the body with the 
fingers, flattening one end between the thumb and fingers to repre- 
sent the tail. It should then be attached to the clay ground. The 
different fins may now be represented by the addition of small, 
flat pieces of clay of the required size and shape placed in their 
correct positions. The mouth and gills should be drawn in with a 
pencil-point, and the eye indicated by a small pellet of clay and 
a line drawn round it with the same instrument. Radiating lines 
should be scratched on the surface of the tail to represent the 
markings. 
A large-sized sprat may measure six inches in length, but the 
usual run is from three to four inches. 
MODELLING A HERRING. 
(PLATE X.) 
To represent this beautiful fish, a process should be followed 
similar to that employed in the case of the sprat. The stronger 
markings of body and fin, the fuller eye, the small fins and deeply 
forked tail, should be carefully observed and reproduced. If the 
sprat has been already modelled, draw the children’s attention to 
these points of difference ; afterwards mix up the models and invite 
the children to sort them into groups again. This provides a useful 
exercise in observation.

A FRUITERER’S SHOP. 
MODELLING A CHESTNUT. 
(PLATE XI.) 
MouLD a wedge-shaped piece of clay in the hands. Soften down 
the edges and carefully secure the well-curved surface of the broad 
end. The tip may be got by pinching it with the fingers. Nuts 
are easily obtained, and each child should be supplied with them 
as models to work from. 
MODELLING A WALNUT. 
(PLATE XI.) 
An egg-shaped piece of clay should be fashioned, and be carefully 
pinched along a “ great circle’’ so as to form the ridge where the 
two halves of the shell join; the tip of the pointed end should also 
be obtained. Markings representing the rough surface of the shell 
should be scratched on with a pencil point. 
MODELLING AN ORANGE. 
(PLATE XII.) 
A globular ball of clay should be manipulated in the hands, and 
then depressed or flattened so as to form an “ oblate spheroid ’’-— 
the characteristic shape of the orange, and of the earth according 
to the old geography books. A shallow cavity for the reception 
of the eye is made in the top with the finger. The texture of the 
rind should be noted and imitated, this being somewhat coarse. 
There are numerous varieties of the orange, differing a little in 
shape, and a great deal in size, the best known being the Chinese or 
Mandarin orange, the Maltese and St. Michael’s oranges, and the 
blood orange, which is remarkable for the colour of its pulp. The 
Seville or bitter orange is another species, of a slightly different 
shape, being, in fact, a “ prolate spheroid.’”’” The rind is much 
rougher also, 
It would be instructive to have as many varieties modelled as 
possible, and their peculiarities carefully noted. This would provide 
a valuable lesson in the perception of delicate variations in form 
and size.

MODELLING A MUSHROOM. 
(PLATE XIII.) 
This makes a very pleasing exercise, from which excellent results 
may be obtained. The vertical stem which supports the cap will 
be obtained by a cylinder of clay ; carefully adjust its thickness to 
the size of the cap it has to carry. The inverted saucer-like cap, 
bearing on its under-surface the plate-like gills, which radiate 
from the stem without being actually in contact with it, should be 
modelled in the palm; and, before it is placed on the stem, the 
markings for the gills should be scratched on the inside with a 
pencil point. 
In the “‘ button ”’ mushroom it will be noted that the stem is not 
much thinner than it is in the full-grown one.

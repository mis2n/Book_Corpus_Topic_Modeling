  Often the jurist engaged in interpreting human laws, the 
historian striving to make plain the lessons of the past, the 
teacher intent upon shaping character, the parent desirous 
of aiding his children to acquire good mental habits, do not 
realize that this work has a common purpose in view—to 
discover the principles by which human behavior may be 
regulated successfully.

  PREFACE 
ProcrEssivE education differs from all other kinds in this, 
that it is patterned after nature. It is the kind by which 
human beings have been educating themselves from the 
beginning. Therefore the author has not proposed to pre- 
sent a new system of education, but rather to give a present- 
day interpretation of a very old one, to show how, in the 
light of the contributions of the modern human sciences, 
a teacher may use nature’s ways in the schoolroom, and a 
parent in the home. 
In Part I the contributions of these sciences are presented 
in plain, untechnical language, informally, and with their 
implications for education. ° In Part IT it is shown in some 
detail how these educational implications may be worked 
out in school methods in developing the life of the school 
and in teaching the subjects of study. 
The writings of modern students of the human sciences 
have been quoted freely for three reasons: first, in acknowl- 
edgment of the author’s indebtedness to them; second, to 
lead readers to these sources for further study; third, to lay 
down dependable stepping-stones for systematic progress 
in the discussion. 
Dr. Calvin N. Kendall, former Commissioner of Educa- 
tion in the State of New Jersey, to whom the author is 
deeply indebted professionally and personally through long 
years of friendship, used to say that he learned what good 
teaching was by watching good teachers at work. To the 
many such teachers with whom it has been his good fortune 
to be associated, the author wishes to acknowledge his 
13015

obligation, also to the classes of teachers and mature students 
with whom he has discussed educational problems, and to 
Professor Edwin A. Shaw, of the Harvard Graduate School 
of Education, for a constructive review of the chapter on 
measurements, although he is in no way responsible for any 
shortcomings that may be discovered in the treatment of 
that subject, a treatment specifically from the standpoint 
of and for the teacher who has slight knowledge of the sub- 
ject. Acknowledgment is made of the generous permission 
of authors and publishers to use the quotations cited in these 
pages. 
Suggestions for supplementary readings are made after 
the last chapter of both Part I and Part II. Eleven books 
have been recommended. Of these five have been selected 
to which special references are made that deal with the large 
topics of the different chapters. These books treat the sub- 
ject from five different angles. They are recommended for 
the Teachers’ Library of the school. The other six books 
are informing interpretations of the present problems of 
human life, including the problems of education. They 
should be on the Teachers’ Shelves of public libraries.

PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
CHAPTER I 
TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 
Education is becoming scientific 
Muczs is heard these days about scientific tests, scientific 
measurements, and the scientific movement in education. 
But the idea that education is to become “‘scientific” has 
not been welcomed by all school people with unreserved 
hospitality. Is it because they are not accustomed to 
scientific thinking? Is it because their schools look strange 
when viewed from the scientific point of view? Is it because 
they must change their accustomed mental attitude and 
give up cherished opinions and ideals? The mind has its 
habitsas the body has, and one must make an effort to change 
them, sometimes strenuous and repeated efforts. When one 
is making the change, there is generally a feeling of uncer- 
tainty, of discomfort, of restlessness, of resistance. The 
mind is conscious of itself as the feet are when they are 
breaking in a new pair of shoes. Yet little progress can be 
made in creating a type of education needed in the twentieth 
century, in fact, we cannot participate helpfully nor with 
satisfaction to ourselves in the new school life that is evolv- 
ing in every community, unless we have some understanding 
of the meaning and the method of scientific thinking and 
. make an effort to use it in planning and doing our daily 
school work. 
Perhaps the first thing to note in our brief consideration 
of scientific thinking is that it is nothing new. The thing
-P-A-G-E-16
    4 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
itself is not new, but its use in education is new. The change 
that is taking place now in education is the same that centu- 
ries ago transformed alchemy into chemistry and astrology 
into astronomy. It is a part of that same movement in 
which the practice of healing passed from the hands of the 
medicine-man and “herb”’-doctor to the hands of the trained 
physician. It is the movement in which all the ancient mag- 
ics have become modern sciences, a movement that had its 
origin in, and that has been carried on by, the use in these 
' various fields of a method of thinking, called scientific 
thinking. 
Development of the science of medicine and of the 
science of education compared 
To illustrate just what is taking place in the change re- 
ferred to, let us review briefly the evolution in the practice 
of medicine. The history of medicine has been divided into 
three pretty distinctly marked periods, the Sacred Period, 
the Philosophical Period, the Scientific Period. 
The Sacred Period extended from the earliest times to 
about five hundred years before Christ. During this time 
the arts of healing were “black” arts and religious customs 
handed down from one generation to another. 
Then followed the Philosophical Period, regarding which 
one writer makes this significant comment,— significant be- 
cause it points to the main weakness of philosophical think- 
ing, namely, indifference to facts. 
The Philosophical Period is inseparably linked with the name of 
Hippocrates, who wrote extensively on surgery, though ignorant of 
dissection. 
This period had three successive phases whose character- 
istics are interesting to teachers because they are familiar 
with similar characteristics in the educational period from
-P-A-G-E-17
TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 5 
which we are just now emerging. This is our excuse for 
noting them somewhat in detail. 
In the first phase of the Philosophical Period of medicine 
we find various “systems” or “schools” of medicine ap- 
pearing, in which beliefs soon became crystallized and fixed. 
In education we do not need to look back far into the past 
to find Pestalozzianism, Froebelianism (later kindergarten) ; 
Grube system of teaching arithmetic; Ward, Progressive, 
Aldine systems of teaching reading; Vertical, Slant, Semi- 
Slant, and Palmer systems of teaching penmanship; and 
‘innumerable other systems and isms some of which are still 
with us and have more or less vogue, although an evidently 
declining vogue. 
Returning to the evolution of medicine, we find there, as 
also in education, that the originators and advocates of 
“systems” and “schools” became dogmatic and insistent. 
They were supremely interested in asserting and defending 
each one his convictions. Dogmatism developed into method- 
ism; that is, elaborated methodologies of procedure in har- 
mony with specific dogmas. Interest was centered in prov- 
ing the practicability and the universal superiority of 
“systems,” of the dogmas on which the systems rested, and 
of the methods that had been devised to apply the dogmas. 
Interest was centered in these things rather than in discover- 
ing new facts that might perchance discredit the dogmas, 
methods, and systems. 
But, naturally enough, multiplicity of methodologies pro- 
duced non-conformists, who, without the ability to break 
away from all dogmas, yet refused to be bound by any one 
set of methods. They claimed the right to choose, and there 
followed a time when eclecticism was rife among doctors. 
Does not this sound familiar in teachers’ ears? In fact, 
while it may have been more common in the recent past, do 
we not now hear the advice not infrequently, “Take what is
-P-A-G-E-18
6 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
best from the kindergarten, or from the Ward, or the 
Grube, and unite it with what is best from other ‘systems’’’? 
— the assumption back of such advice being that “systems” 
are the reservoirs from which educational truth is to be 
drawn. But, as we shall see shortly, the real reservoir of 
truth is nature, a fact that medicine discovered long befcre 
education did. 
The Philosophical Period of medical development with 
its three phases came to an end about 300 B.c. (It thus ap- 
pears that medicine is in its evolution more than fifteen 
hundred years ahead of education.) Then opened the 
Anatomic Period that extends to our time. It may properly 
be called the Scientific Period, inasmuch as it has been char- 
acterized by the application of scientific thinking to medical 
practice. Its beginning was marked by the first dissection 
of the human body. 
Reasons for delay in making education scientific 
The foregoing review of the development of medicine 
gives a background for understanding these words of Ma- 
dame Montessori: 
Much has been said in the last decade concerning the tendency of 
pedagogy, following in the footsteps of medicine, to pass beyond 
the purely speculative stage and base its conclusions on the positive 
results of experimentation. Physiological or experimental psychol- 
ogy, which has become organized into a.new science, seems destined 
to furnish to the new pedagogy that fundamental preparation 
which the old-time metaphysical psychology furnished to philo- 
sophical pedagogy. 
The great Italian teacher has given us here a statement. 
amely, that education is now passing from the phil- 
] into the scientific stage, as medicine did fifteen

" TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING q 
hundred years ago, and she has told us why education has 
lagged s so far_behind_her- sister. profession. It is because 
education must find its reasons in the nature of children and 
in the nature of society. “As“long~as these subjects are 
thought of in terms of traditional beliefs, in terms of surmise 
and assumption, education will of necessity be thought of in 
the same kind of terms. It is only when they. are studied 
analytically — that is, scientifically, that is, with a serious 
purpose to find out what the mind of man is, what human 
society is, and how and why these act as they do— it is only 
then that education will be-constructed to harmonize with 
nature, 
We have seen how recent has been the development of the 
study of the human mind into a science (psychology). For 
the development of the study of human society (sociology), 
let us go to a recently published book, The Mind in the 
Making, by James Harvey Robinson. Here we find the 
following: 1 
And now the astonishing and perturbing suspicion emerges that 
perhaps almost:all that had passed for social science, political econ- 
omy, politics, and ethics in the past may be brushed aside by future 
generations as mainly rationalizing.? John Dewey has already 
reached this conclusion in Saga to philosophy. Other writers have 
devoted hundreds of pages . . to substantiating a similar thesis af- 
fecting all the social sciences. This conclusion may be rankéd by 
students of a hundred years hence as one of the several great discov- 
eries of our age. 
So we see that thinking on educational problems is just 
becoming modern, because thinking on all the problems that 
relate to human life is just becoming modern. While, long 
ago, we refused to employ an “‘herb’’-doctor, a “quack” —

2 “Rationalizing” is defined elsewhere by the author as “the process of 
finding plausible excuses for our routine beliefs.” It is another name for 
speculative, defensive, philosophical thinking.
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
that is, one who practiced by the arts of the “natural” 
doctor — we are just emerging from complacency at em- 
ploying teachers and principals who are thinking about 
education in the same way that those engaged in the study 
of the stars, of the earth, and of nature were thinking before 
the time of Galileo, of Columbus, and of Lord Bacon. A 
new world has been made by man to follow the old world 
by the use of a different type or way of thinking. This idea is 
difficult for many to understand. But it is as true that we 
“must be born again” mentally — that is, that we must 
accept and apply a different method of thinking before we 
can become participating members of the new intellectual 
world — as it was true in matters of morals and religion 
when these words, “‘ Ye must be born again,” were first used 
by the Master in trying to impress on his hearers the fact 
that citizenship in a new spiritual world required the adop- 
tion of a new spiritual point of view and a new method of 
living. 
Philosophical and scientific thinking illustrated 
Because the scientific method of thinking in education is 
so new, we must give ourselves time to get used to it. For 
some it will be more difficult to do this than it will be for 
others. Perhaps it is more difficult for some caterpillars to 
pass into the butterfly stage than it is for other caterpillars. 
Certainly we know that all people do not find it equally easy 
to follow the Master’s injunction to be “born again” into a 
new spiritual life. But we are not dealing with figures of 
speech when we are discussing types or kinds of thinking. 
Toillustrate how real the facts are, let us apply the two ways, 
philosophical and scientific thinking, to some common edu- 
cational problems. We will select for our first problem one 
that a school principal meets very often; for our second, one 
that arises in the home. 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 9 
Problem 1. A boy is sent to the school office for miscon- 
duct. He carries a note in which it is stated that James, 
the bearer, has disregarded the rules of the school so often 
that the teacher cannot have him in her room unless he is 
willing to be obedient. 
Let us assume that the principal solves the problem as 
follows: 
a. 
b. eS oo 
J- He talks to the boy, telling him a number of things that 
he knows about him. 
He asks him leading questions which he expects to be 
answered in one way only. 
. He emphasizes the value of an education. 
. He points out the cost of schools to the community 
and to parents. 
. He recalls the necessity of school rules and the impor- 
tance of obedience in every one’s life. 
. He brings into relief the superior wisdom of the principal 
and teachers because of their age and long experience. 
. He urges that all the rules are for the good of the 
pupils. 
. Logically, therefore, it follows that rules must be obeyed 
by all pupils. 
. The principal probably will call attention to punish- 
ments that must follow continued disobedience. 
He finally extracts a promise of conformity to rules in 
future, and James returns to his teacher. 
This is a sample of the authoritative, dogmatic, philo- 
sophical method of thinking, a rather dignified term, we ad- 
mit, for a piece of thinking so common and so commonplace. 
If, however, the principal has adopted the scientific 
method of thinking he will proceed somewhat in this way: 
a. Before saying anything to the boy, he will ask himself 
some such questions and make some such observations 
as these:
-P-A-G-E-22
10 
  PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
(1) What are rules for — to illustrate my wisdom, to 
train children in obedience, to establish a uniform 
plan of conduct? 
(2) Are rules a “means” or an “end”? 
(3) If they are a “means,” a means to what? 
(4) If rules are assumed to be a “means” by which the 
school becomes a better place for all to live in than 
it would be without them, they are evidently not 
serving their purpose with James, for they seem to 
have been the means of excluding him from school. 
(5) The chances are that James is at fault, but possibly 
the rules may be. 
(6) There is maladjustment here. What may be the 
reason — the boy probably does not know. The 
reasons may lie in his health conditions, in his home 
conditions, in his lack of ability to do assigned work, 
in temperament. 
(7) May it be that the school life, as we adults have 
fashioned it, does not give sufficient “play” for 
personality, the object of our chief concern in 
education. 
(8) Perhaps the teacher and I, together with James and 
the other pupils, can work out a type of school life 
and some rules that will be a more successful 
“means” for attaining our desired educational 
ends than our present rules are. 
. With this sort of opp-minded, analytic thinking as a 
background, the prine egins (not to tell James a lot 
t of things) to inquire, estigate, to get facts regard- 
ing the boy, his interests, abilities, etc., etc. 
. With these facts he experiments with the teacher’s help 
and with the boy’s help, until a working plan is found. 
As we are not concerned with the particular plan which 
did work in this oe case, but only with the
-P-A-G-E-23
  TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 11 
method of thinking that was used, we need not follow 
James and his disobedience further. The principal 
by the use of this method of thinking may not find an 
immediate solution of the problem, but he will be led 
by the facts revealed in each experiment to other ex- 
periments that will be nearer a solution. 
Problem 2. A boy goes to his father and says that he 
wants to enter the navy. He knows that his father has in- 
tended that he should be a lawyer. The father may think 
through this problem in two ways, as we have seen the 
principal could think his problem in two ways. 
If he thinks philosophically, he will say in effect: 
a. “My boy, it has been my ambition, since you were born, 
to have you follow me in the law. I have an established 
practice, most of which I could turn over to you. Tam 
older than you. I have had more experience in life. I 
know the difficulties of starting on a career without 
help. You do not know what is best for you. This navy 
business is just a notion. Give it up. The matter is 
settled. You will enter the law school as soon as you 
are ready.” 
But, if the father adopts the scientific method of thinking, 
he will follow somewhat this line of reasoning with himself: 
a. Why does the boy want to enter the navy? 
b. What does he know about it? 
c. How serious is he? 
d. What are his aptitudes for any business so far as they 
have appeared? 
e. Has he had a chance to find out what his long-distance 
tastes and abilities are? 
f. What do I really want for my boy, a particular career, 
or a satisfying and a successful life? 
1 For a further discussion of similar problems see chapter on “Disci- 
pline,” Part II. 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
12 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
g. Am I sure that such a life is not waiting for him in the 
navy? 
h. Am I in danger of spoiling his life, if I insist on my plan? 
Do I know enough to do it safely? 
i. Would it perhaps be well to let him try his plan first? 
j. Am I justified in asking him to try my plan first, with 
the understanding that, if it fails, I will give my full 
consent to his plan? 
Here we see the father’s mind working by the method of 
question, inquiry, investigation, a method that does not 
lead to quick conclusions nor to finalities, but one that 
proceeds experimentally, using the facts as they are pro- 
gressively revealed. 
Philosophical thinking tends to keep things as they are 
The essential differences in the two kinds of thinking are 
now easily seen. 
Philosophical thinking starts with a conviction, a mind 
“made up,” and it proceeds to find reasons for supporting» 
and defending the “conviction.” Our “convictions” be- 
come our standards by which persons and things are judged. 
That act is right, that fact 7s true, that idea is good, that 
decision is just, that object is beautiful, if in each instance it 
harmonizes with our “conviction” of what is right, true, 
good, just, and beautiful. What does not harmonize with 
our convictions we with intolerance label wrong, false, bad, 
unjust, and ugly. 
We hold these “convictions” under different names. Com- 
monly we speak of them as “my opinions” or “my ideas.” 
When we call them by these names, we do not défend them 
very stoutly. But when, in matters of conduct, we speak of 
“my convictions,” we are inclined to label them “ideals,” 
and then we defend them very vigorously, even at times 
fiercely and unto death. But, after all, our “ideals” are but 
+ 
«
-P-A-G-E-25
TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 18 
“ideas” that have become firmly fixed and, so-to-say, 
clothed with somewhat more priestly [garments than our 
more work-a-day “opinions” are, and so we give them 
greater reverence. Our mental attitude toward them being 
more submissive, we being little inclined to think about ideals, 
but rather to use them emotionally, they exercise the greater 
authority over us. When we have built our “convictions ” 
into a system, we have a “philosophy,” and here “ideals ” 
hold a very conspicuous place. The professional philosopher 
builds a super-philosophy which he calls “metaphysics,” a 
nebulous region of thought where all things are sacred be- 
cause nothing is understood. But there is one other field 
in which we find “convictions” under a different name. 
In religion they are known as “creeds.” 
In philosophical thinking we do not ask the question, “Is 
my conviction, my idea, my ideal, my creed true to known 
or knowable facts, or may it sometime possibly be proved 
not to be true?”’ — but, assuming its truth as absolute and 
final, we devote our energies to finding, and to setting forth 
and defending, reasons that support it. So this kind of 
thinking has been called “rationalizing”; that is, “finding 
reasons for going on believing as we already do,” as Profes- 
sor Robinson puts it. 
Scientific thinking tends to promote change 
In scientific thinking we use what might be called the 
reverse of the process described in the preceding paragraphs. 
Ridding ourselves of all “convictions,” we start out to find 
facts. By facts we mean what seems to be so. 'These facts 
we arrange first in this way and then in that to discover 
significant relations, as a savage might who chanced upon a 
gun, a keg of powder, and a box of bullets, or as a civilized 
man from the cold regions would do if he were cast on a 
tropical island and must find out what could be used for
-P-A-G-E-26

food among the unfamiliar products that nature offered. 
After possibly several different arrangements of facts have 
been made, we construct a theory. The theory, or hy- 
pothesis as it is also called, is then given atrial. If the trial 
is successful, the theory is considered a good one to be used 
again. If it fails, it is cast aside and a new one is constructed. 
We have no respect for the theory except in so far as it guides 
us to new knowledge and to new understanding. 
Scientific thinking is a search for truth. 
Philosophical thinking is a search for reasons to support 
and defend an assumed truth. 
Differences in the two kinds of thinking summarized 
A comparative schedule of characteristics will throw into 
relief the differences in these two methods of thinking. 
Philosophical thinking 
It starts with an assumption, a 
conviction, an ideal, a creed, a phi- 
losophy to which the mind is com- 
mitted as a final, absolute truth 
that is not to be questioned. 
The proof of the correctness of 
philosophical thinking is the result- 
ing harmony with the presupposi- 
tions with which the thinking 
started. 
Tt employs the art of the logician. 
It assumes absolute values. 
It is deductive. 
It is idealistic. 
It is interested in maintaining the 
old. It is static, conservative. Scientific thinking 
It starts with a theory that the 
mind holds tentatively and follows 
as a guide in an investigation or an 
experiment in a search for further 
knowledge. 
The proof of the correctness of 
scientific thinking is the workability 
of the results when they are applied 
in ways useful to mankind. 
It employs the art of the system- 
atic investigator. 
It recognizes only relative values. 
It is inductive. 
It is pragmatic. 
It is interested in setting to work 
the new. It is progressive, liberal. 
The use and misuse of each kind of thinking 
Tt may seem that in our discussion so far we have been 
eondemning philosophical thinking and commending scien-
-P-A-G-E-27

tific thinking. If that is so, it is because we are approach- 
ing the subject from the point of view of education, and in 
this field there has been much harm done by the misuse of 
dogmatic thinking. The fact is, however, that both kinds 
are useful, each in its own place. Every one thinks in one 
way some of the time in some departments of his life, and 
at other times in other departments he thinks in the other 
way. 
A man, if he is to succeed in business, must be an open- 
minded investigator of business conditions all the time. He 
must be ready at any time to change his prices, his business 
forms, his business methods. Philosophical thinking carries 
many a business man into bankruptcy. But the successful 
business man, highly scientific in his business thinking, votes 
year after year with the party that his father and grandfather 
supported, just because he was born into that party, and he 
goes to the church that his mother and grandmother sup- 
ported, just because he was born into that church. You say 
that he does these things in politics and religion without 
thinking? Is it not rather true that he says, “In business 
I must inquire, investigate, and be ready to change my 
methods, but I have no time to do this kind of thinking in 
other matters. What my father thought in politics is good 
enough forme. What my mother taught me about God and 
goodness is good enough for me.” In other words, our 
business man is, in his business, all the time searching for 
new facts and for better ways, but in his politics and religion 
he is searching for reasons and for ways for continuing as 
he is. And perhaps we should not condemn him, unless his 
conservatism sometime may align him with the forces of 
unrighteousness. 
We begin these two kinds of thinking early. A baby 
finds a match. He handles it, looks at it, tastes it, rubs it 
now on one énd and now on the other, at last setting it into
-P-A-G-E-28
  16 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
ablaze. In a crude way he is thinking scientifically. But 
he is just as likely, asswming that the match is good to eat, 
to proceed at once to swallow it. This would be an example 
of philosophical thinking, an infantile example, to be sure, 
but at the same time typical of what we older people are 
doing constantly. It may be that, as we have grown older, 
we have only exchanged the swallowing of matches for the 
swallowing of ideas. 
Scientific thinking is harder to do than philosophical 
thinking is, and there is a natural tendency to slip from the 
former into the latter. How easily a “working theory”’ be- 
comes a “conviction.” A frosty morning in early winter 
finds several boys on the edge of a pond. They try the ice 
gingerly, keeping one foot on shore. They venture out a 
little and find the ice still holds. They are experimenters, 
searchers for knowledge. The knowledge they gain they 
put together into theories, each one no broader than the 
facts they have learned. These in turn they use to guide 
them only a little in advance of their knowledge. But the 
“will to believe,” optimism, and courage rise with each new 
successful trial of a theory. Before they are aware of it, 
their theories have become certainties, and they begin to 
hunt for reasons to support the conviction that the whole 
pond is safe, not by trying the ice everywhere, not, in other 
words, by extending their knowledge, but by a process of 
defensive logic. To-morrow the assumption of to-day has 
becomé a fixed conviction and believed as true to-day, even 
if the weather has changed. 
So it is more or less with us all. A small success with a 
theory causes us to accept it as generally true. .Then we 
accept it as true in all times and under all circumstances. 
We pass it along to our children as an “ideal,” although for 
us it was in the beginning but an idea that promised well. 
So our so-called statesmen quote the theories of Washington
-P-A-G-E-29
  TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 17 
and of Monroe on our foreign policy, theories that rested on 
the facts of the world as it was a century ago. Their theories 
became fixed national “ideals” to be defended as final and 
absolute wisdom for all time. This easy-going philosophical 
thinking in national affairs gets nowhere in solving new 
problems that have arisen because of new world conditions. 
But in spite of the fact that this kind of thinking may be 
thus misused, it is nevertheless most useful in its proper 
place. The mental attitude that goes with it gives stability ~ 
to life. Yet, when it is misused, it tends to choke up the 
springs of life with the antique bric-a-brac of outgrown be- 
liefs and institutions; to blind the mental eyes of the present. 
with the reflected glory of the past; to befuddle the intelli- 
gence with the dictates of authority. And when these 
tendencies have lasted too long, the inner urges of life assert 
themselves in rebellion. 
There are dangers, too, that go with scientific thinking. 
It tends to instability and to mental restlessness. To be sure, 
it is the method of the liberal thinker in religion, social 
study, business, politics, and education, but it leads in the 
direction of the wilderness of radicalism and anarchy. 
Without scientific thinking the human race would be in a 
state of savagery. But without philosophical thinking there 
would have been no customs, no institutions, no organized 
society, nothing stable on which mankind could stand while 
preparation was being made for the next advance. There 
come times when it is necessary to accept theories that are 
not fully proved and use them as if they were proved. No 
one person can with profit be doubting everything and in- 
vestigating everything all the time. But there is little 
chance of finding anything in these days that some one or 
some group is not studying intensively with the scientific 
purpose and method. It behooves those who are taking a 
philosophical attitude toward any human interest to main-
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
tain an open and a receptive attitude of mind toward the 
facts brought to light by those who are investigating and 
experimenting, because, as we have said before, when ideas, 
customs, institutions have become fixed to that degree that 
it is a crime and asin to question them even in the presence 
of new facts, then a reaction of violence may be expected. 
How these paths marked out by these two methods of 
thinking come together when they are used without mental 
balance may be illustrated as shown in Fig. 1

The desirable balance beween the two kinds of thinking 
We may hope that the general intelligence of mankind has 
developed to the point where a balance may be maintained 
between these two kinds of thinking, so that ideas, ideals, 
institutions, creeds may change by a process of evolution, 
rather than by periodic upheavals and revolutions. But 
this desired condition in human affairs will be delayed until 
we are willing whole-heartedly to submit our deepest con- 
victions, our most cherished ideals, our most comforting 
belief to the impersonal analysis of scientific thinking. 
This is the way of growth. This is the way of progress, 
This is the way of life that is engaged in creating new physical 
forms through which it may find new ways of expressing itself. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, in an inspired moment, has pic- 
tured for us in miniature the process of progressing physical 
change in which our mental life finds its counterpart: 
Year after year beheld the silent toil 
That spread his lustrous coil; 
Still, as the spiral grew, 
He left the last year’s dwelling for the new, 
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,) 
Built up its idle door, 
Stretched in his last-found home, and knew the old no more. 
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that sings: 
Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul, 
As the swift seasons roll! 
Leave thy low-vaulted past! 
Let each new temple, nobler than the last, 
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast, 
Till thou at length art free, 
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life’s unresting sea! 
This balance is needed in progressive education 
We know people whose minds rethind us of a weather- 
vane, for they are turned about by every breeze of doctrine.
-P-A-G-E-32
  2 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
These are vacillating minds, not progressive minds. We 
are told to “try all things,” and “to hold fast that which is 
good.” The sort of balance is called for here that we have 
been discussing, and the balance is possible to maintain. 
It is entirely within our power to hold steadily to ideas and 
practices that are working well, and at the same time to 
keep them subject to revision when circumstances arise in 
which they do not seem to work or when new knowledge 
shows that our ideas and practices may be improved. We 
are engaged in a business that, perhaps more than any other, 
requires constant readjustments, because it is an ever new 
world in which we are trying to help our pupils find a suc- 
cessful place. 
Summary of Chapter I 
1. In the past thinking on educational subjects, not only 
in the field of theory, but equally in the field of administra- 
tion and of schoolroom practice, has been predominatingly 
defensive, the kind a lawyer uses in defending his client. 
It has started with assumptions and has proceeded to hunt 
for reasons to support an educational policy of conformity 
with the assumptions. 
2. This kind of thinking, called by various names, com- 
monly known as deductive, and less commonly as specu- 
lative, philosophical, and metaphysical thinking, tends to 
keep things as they are. It produces stability, but pre- 
vents progress. 
8. Progress, the discovery of new knowledge, the re- 
valuation of old knowledges, the adjustment of mental at- 
titudes and of life in general to new knowledges and to new 
conditions, comes and always has come by the use of what 
is generally called scientific thinking. This, too, is known 
by different names. It is variously called inductive, experi- 
mental, analytic, pragmatic thinking.
-P-A-G-E-33
  TWO KINDS OF EDUCATIONAL THINKING 21 
4. It is the nature of mind to work in both ways. How- 
ever, philosophical thinking is easier because, having ac- 
cepted certain convictions, ideals, and creeds, we become 
accustomed to them, we find our associates accept them, 
and it requires an effort even to question them. To do so 
may bring upon us suspicion and possibly alienation of 
friends. It is easier to conform and to defend than it is to 
be an aggressive questioner and non-conformist. 
Largely, perhaps, for these reasons in the past scientific 
thinkers have been in the minority. But the advance of 
what is called civilization has been accompanied by a pro- 
gressive increase in the number of scientific thinkers. 
5. Each kind of thinking has its own place and its peculiar 
value. It is a problem that no intelligent person can escape, 
to determine when to use the one kind and when the other. 
Some one has said that we are under obligation to ourselves 
and to the next generation to subject every one of our most 
sacred and cherished convictions to unbiased analysis and 
reconstruction once in our lifetime. 
6. At least it may be said that those who are engaged in 
the work of education are constrained by peculiar moral 
obligations to study their tasks scientifically and to train 
their pupils to think scientifically, because upon the school, 
more than upon any other institution or agency in the com- 
munity, rests the responsibility of adjusting the citizenry to 
a constantly changing world, -

  CHAPTER IT 
THE BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 
Scientific thinking is free from bias and prejudice 
As we have seen in the preceding chapter, one of the char- 
acteristics of scientific thinking is freedom from bias and 
prejudice. Therefore the first thing for one to do who sets 
himself to this kind of thinking in any particular field is 
to put aside all convictions of every kind in that field. To 
do this partially, retaining some pet notion, some particu- 
larly sacred ideal, will be to retain some vestige of swaddling 
clothes which will limit the mind’s complete freedom of 
action and reaction. Thus some significant meaning will 
surely be unperceived. 
In some fields of thought it is not difficult to be impartial, 
and such fields have broadened and have multiplied as the 
years of human history have passed. The time was when 
no one could question that our earth is the center of the 
universe and that the sun and all the other heavenly bodies 
moved in circles about it. No other view was tolerated. 
All minds were closed in the field of astronomy. To-day 
no one is troubled by the discovery of new worlds, by the 
rumor that we have received a radio message from Mars, 
or by any other fact or alleged fact regarding our universe. 
Likewise we have ceased to be prejudiced regarding any 
new discovery in physics or chemistry. We easily adjust 
our minds to the thought that it may be possible to change 
iron into gold, as we have adjusted it to the wireless “broad- 
casting” of music and speech. Our colonial ancestors 
would have considered these ideas and inventions as of the 
Evil One. All minds would have been prejudiced against 
them. In these times, however, we are all open minded to
-P-A-G-E-35
  
BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 23 
receive and discuss any new facts and any new interpreta- 
tions anywhere in the field of nature. 
Difficulty in being unprejudiced regarding human affairs 
But we are not so open-minded in the study of questions 
relating to human life. There many of us appear to main- 
tain the mental biases that restrained freedom of thought in 
medieval times. Our slowness in ridding ourselves of bias 
in this field is due in part, doubtless, to the fact that our 
religion plays a large part here and also to our habit of ap- 
proaching questions relating to human life, that is, matters 
of “mind” and “soul” by introspection. We have become 
accustomed to the idea that “mind” and “soul” are mys- 
teries not to be profaned by the analytic methods of science. 
We have said, “I know that this or that is so, because I know 
it and because I feel it.”” With this set of mind we conceive 
that to approach these matters of the “inner life” from the 
“physical” side is to go by a forbidden path at the end of 
which we are sure to be overpowered by soul-destroying 
influences. 
So it may be expected that many teachers, thus preju- 
diced, will be repelled at first when one who has studied life 
scientifically without such prejudice (the biologist) talks 
about the “mechanistic conception of life.” An explanation 
of life in terms of machinery, of physics, and of chemistry 
seems to make use entirely “material” or “physical,” while 
we are conscious of ourselves, we know ourselves, as in part 
“mental” and “spiritual.” Two considerations may help 
to make us more open-minded to the messages that are 
coming tothe schoolroom with increasing force and frequency 
from the laboratories of science. 
Unfounded prejudices & 
Let us consider first the belief, quite commonly held, that
-P-A-G-E-36
  WA PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
the scientist is a destroyer of religion. This belief has no 
substantial foundation. No fact has been discovered by 
scientific research that disproves or discredits the belief in 
the existence of God, or of the individual mind and soul of 
man, or of the existence of the soul before birth or of its 
continuance after death. Many men and women who stand 
high in the scientific world cherish some or all of these beliefs. 
Neither is there any scientific proof that the “soul” may not 
leave the body for a time and return to it again, or that there 
is not a world of spirits from which messages and messengers 
come to us here on earth, as many good people believe, among 
them scientists of note. And again there is no proof that 
the evolutionary theory of development applies in unbroken 
continuity to the history of man. One may accept all the 
well-authenticated facts that a scientific study of life from 
the “physical” side reveals, and yet hold whatever beliefs 
he pleases on these questions that are so often woven into 
religious creeds. 
To be sure, some people, not all of them scientists, are led, 
by the unquestioned facts regarding our physical life that 
have been brought to light by scientific research during the 
past century, to surmise or to infer that mental and spiritual 
life are but extensions of the physical life, that they are only 
different manifestations of the same energy, but no scientist 
asserts that this has been proved. As an indication of this 
we will quote the words of one who has gone probably as far 
as any in trying to discover physical and chemical explana- 
tions for thought and behavior. He writes: 
We are not yet able to give an answer to the question how life 
originated on the earth. 
A recent writer affirms that 
The appearance of human beings capable of considerable intellec-

-P-A-G-E-37
  BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 265 
tual activity, descendants of the primitive men of the Old Stone 
Age, is “one of the great mysteries of psychology and history.” + 
Another scientist, who has made a special study of the 
influences of the glands of the human body upon mental 
activities and abilities, writes: 
The declaration that a man is dominated by certain glands 
within his body should not be taken to give aid and comfort to 
those who would banish mind from the universe.? 
In Madame Montessori we have an illustration of the 
fact that a highly spiritual idealism need not be disturbed 
by the pursuit of those truths that are discovered by scien- 
tific thinking. She, more boldly than any one else, has 
applied the results of this thinking in trying to solve the 
problems of education. This somewhat extended quota- 
tion from her writings is a call to all teachers to participate 
in the discovery of the world as it is, a world quite different 
from the traditional one of our forbears, and it is a firm re- 
buke to those who assert that such alliance is a union with 
the workers of unrighteousness: 
When man loses himself in mere speculation [philosophical think- 
ing],? his environment will remain unchanged, but when imagina- 
tion starts from contact with reality [the products of scientific 
. thinking], thought begins to construct works by means of which 
the external world becomes transformed; almost as if the thought 
of man had assumed a marvelous power: the power to create. 
It is thus we imagine the thought of God; all creation in the 
divine thought, which has the property of realizing itself. God 
thought: and behold! light, the order of creation, living things, ap- 
peared.

    26 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Modern man by the method of positive science [experimental or 
scientific study]! seems to have found the secret trace of thought 
which puts him in the divine path.? 
So it would seem that no one need be deterred from en- 
gaging in the scientific study of life in any of its many phases 
by a fear that it may lead to atheism or to a denial of our 
personality or of our self-knowledge. If any one has arrived 
at these negations, it is not by following the narrow path of 
science, but by wandering from it into the alluring fields of 
inference and assumption. 
Tf one has succeeded in ridding his mind of the unjustified 
prejudice that scientific thinking about human life leads 
easily to irreligion, he may still feel that at least it degrades 
“mind” and “soul” and “morality” to discuss them in 
terms which we use when we discuss “matter.”” We think 
of matter as gross and, as we say, “material.” We think of 
mind as not only different from matter, but finer, or, as we 
say, “spiritual.” We have here another prejudice that 
prevents us from opening our minds fully to the scientific 
discussion of mental and spiritual things, but there is as little 
reason for it as there was for the other prejudice. These 
different estimates that we commonly put on “mind” and 
“matter” are thoughtlessly made. We do not so differen- 
tiate them in our more serious moments. For instance, in 
the olden time our savage ancestors used to worship the 
sun as a god or the home of a god. They thought of it as 
something “spiritual” and not to be discussed in the same 
terms that were used to discuss the earth. But we know the 
sun as a whirling mass of glowing fluid or gas, drawn through 
space (not by ethereal horses driven by angels) by the force 
of gravity, together with its accompanying worlds and their 
moons. Is this “material” wonder less worthy to be revered

by us than it was by those who conceived of it as something 
“ spiritual”? 
Materialism is what we make it 
Some years ago in late autumn a young man was tramping 
over the hills of northern New Hampshire. By chance he 
found himself on an outcropping ledge at the end of a long 
valley extending far to the north. He sat down or rather 
reclined and lapsed into that state of half-awakeness in 
which mind, body, and nature become one. Then gradually 
out of the mist that closed in the vista at its distant end an 
ethereal whiteness appeared to float suspended in air, like a 
heavenly visitor. The effect of it on the half-conscious 
watcher alone on the projecting ledge was not different, 
perhaps, from that made upon the Bethlehem shepherds by 
the “heavenly hosts.” 
But the rays of the setting sun flashed through the mist, 
for a short moment revealing a mountain with a cap of snow. 
The snow cap and the heavenly visitor was one and the 
same. 
Did the quality of sacredness depart when the flash of 
light explained the vision in material terms? Quite the 
contrary. From that day the young man has had a finer 
appreciation of Hawthorne’s insight into the spiritual 
influences of nature which he sets forth in The Great Stone 
Face, and since then nature has had a new and a holier mean- 
ing. 
If scientists are discovering that physical and chemical 
forces are playing a larger part in the processes of human life 
and of human society than we had before suspected, there 
is no reason for ignoring or rejecting this new knowledge 
because it seems to point in the direction of materialism. 
“Materialism” is what each one makes of it for himself. 
Some, quite without any scientific sanctions, make of it a

godless universe, but others make of it a universe in which 
God is the moving power. To them the world that we know 
through the senses is the body of the creating One.

For all we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool; 
And the ear of man cannot hear, and the eye of man cannot see; 
But if we could see and hear this Vision — were it not He? + 
When therefore modern scientific students use the expres- 
sion “mechanistic conception of life,” when they propose to 
“measure intelligence,” when they find that human oe 
is definitely influenced by the body — that is, by the ‘‘ma- 
chinery” through which life acts — even when they talk 
about the “chemistry of the soul,” there is really no cause 
for being disturbed. They are but using the vocabulary of 
science to express physical, chemical, and physiological facts. 
The language may be strange to us when it is used in dis- 
cussing mental and spiritual things, but the ideas they clothe 
have, many of them, profound meaning for education. It is 
for us, teachers, to discover this meaning and to learn how 
to apply it in our daily tasks. To this end let us take a brief 
General view of the mechanistic conception of life 
We are now quite accustomed to thinking of animal bod- 
ies, including the human body, as machines. Textbooks on 
hygiene point out many likenesses between the two. It is 
shown that the skeleton is made up of different kinds of

levers; that the muscles act like ropes; that the stomach is a 
fuel box; that the heart is a pump; that the lungs are air- 
boxes and ventilating shafts; and that the nervous system 
is an electrical control system, the brain being a central 
switchboard, the spinal cord a “trunk” line, and the differ- 
ent nerves, innumerable “‘party”’ lines. 
But living machines differ from a steam engine in this, 
that they grow in size, strength, and complexity (up to a 
certain limit), that they make their own repairs, and that 
they reproduce other machines like themselves. 
Thus there are a large number of particulars in which 
these two kinds of machines are alike, and at least three 
particulars in which they are very unlike in the nature of 
what we may call their structure. But a machine is a struc- 
ture driven or moved by a force. We naturally ask, “Is 
‘living’ force like ‘mechanical’ force?” 
The answer is that in some respects “life” or vital force 
is very similar to all other forces. For instance, it strives to 
overcome resistance. When we feel an impulse, or when our 
pupils do, to “have our own way,” we are conscious of this 
“push” quality that characterizes all energy, whether it be 
“living” or “mechanical.” A French writer has said: 
eA 
“Etre c’est lutter, vivre c’est vaincre.” 
(To exist is to struggle, to be alive is to conquer.) 
Life force has this other likeness to mechanical force, that 
it expresses itself in different ways through different mechan-~ 
isms. For example, electricity manifests itself now as 
magnetism, now as heat, now as light, now as sound, accord- 
ing to the sort of machinery through which it passes. So 
life force manifests itself as feeling, and as thinking, and as 
aspiration as it expresses itself in the successively complex 
mechanisms that develop from the original cell in which it 
starts.

But life force is peculiar in this, that it is self-organizing, 
and under certain conditions develops “consciousness” 
of self and of the world of nature and of people with which 
it is surrounded. So far as we know, mechanical forces do 
not have this power. 
Of the origin of force we know nothing. We say some- 
times that “electricity is generated in the battery” and that 
“steam is generated in the boiler.”” But we know that in 
neither case is force really generated. In the battery we have 
but provided the conditions favorable for the forces lying 
hidden in the materials in the battery to express themselves 
in the manner that we call electrical. In the same way the 
heat under the boiler provides a condition that releases the 
power inherent in the water. So also we know nothing of 
the origin of “life.”” We become aware of it only when it 
appears in a “cell” that has met conditions favorable for its 
release. A kernel of corn lying in moist, warm soil has 
found these favorable conditions, and a “life” is released 
in the kernel to do its constructive work of root, stalk, leaf, 
flower, and seed building. Whether the “life” of the corn-_ 
seed did in fact originate in the kernel, or whether, in its’ 
growing, it had enmeshed some of that universal energy 
which seems to permeate all nature, no one may say with cer- 
tainty. And one can be no more sure of the source of human 
“life” than of vegetable “life.” 
The only soil we know of, the real foundation stones of our being 
and living, are the cells we are made of.! 
But, while the origin of “‘life” is yet undiscovered, we 
have learned a good deal about it, as we have about other 
forces, by studying how it acts while it is harnessed to its 
self-constructed organism or machinery. Some of these 
characteristics, significant for education, are here described.

i The living cell 
From the instant a cell becomes “alive” the following 
changes can be seen: 
a. The cell begins to divide into a number of parts. This 
is the beginning of growth. 
b. In this change, or growth, certain food elements in the 
cell are absorbed. As, for example, in a hen’s egg, the 
“white” of the egg is used for food by the growing 
chick before it breaks the shell. 
ce. This living process of growth continues — cell after cell 
taking to itself food for the maintenance of its own 
energy and for the production of new cells like itself. 
d. These cells, multiplying in this fashion, arrange them- 
selves in different ways and become changed into a 
variety of forms making different “tissues.” Thus 
bones, muscles, nerves, hair, nails, skin, etc., and the 
vital organs and glands are evolved until the human 
body is fashioned.* 
_ e. This process of growth continues until the capacity 
for growth has reached its limit, unless accident, dis- 
~ ease, or lack of available food interferes. A robin, for 
example, cannot grow beyond the size predetermined 
in the robin egg. And every human being finds the 
bounds of his expanding life, mental as well as physi- 
cal, established in the minute egg in which he has his 
A beginning. 
™ 
Some characteristics of life force 
As this “vital force” works through its mechanism, it 
shows definite native tendencies to act in specific ways. 
a. It seems to have likes and dislikes — to take to itself 
1 The growth of vegetable and lower animal life is by a similar 
Process.
-P-A-G-E-44
  PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
some kinds of food and to discard others, to be attracted 
by certain contacts and repelled by others, as we our- 
selves like sweet and dislike sour. We enjoy the “feel” 
of smooth, silky objects and dislike rough ones. A 
cat “likes” to be stroked from head to tail, and “dis- 
likes” to be stroked in the opposite direction. The 
quality by which a living organism is thus affected is 
called feeling or susceptibility. 
b. There appears to be a desire, a wish, an urge, or an im- 
pulse, by whatever name we may prefer to call it, to 
seek what will give a pleasant feeling, a satisfaction, 
and to avoid what will give an unpleasant feeling. Life 
in its lowest to its highest forms is not quiescent, ac- 
cepting what befalls of joy and sorrow, but it is aggres- 
sive. It seeks for satisfying experiences and it avoids 
experiences that are distressing. 
c. These “desires” for satisfying experiences seem to be 
the impelling and directing causes for action in all 
living organisms. Hunger for food, thirst for drink, 
are among these “desires” and we can get some notion 
of their driving power if we will recall our feeling when 
we were “almost famished for food” or were “dying of 
thirst.” When a “foot goes to sleep,” or some muscles 
have become cramped by being forced into a strained 
position for a long time, or when we have a hard pain 
anywhere, how the whole body calls for relief, and how 
strong the inner urge is to do something that will restore 
the pleasing physical sensation! These desires are as 
much “hungers”’ as our desire for food is a hunger, and 
we are impelled by them as truly and as urgently on 
the higher levels of mental and spiritual living as we 
are on the lower level of the physical. 
d. This also seems to be true of life force, that the mechan- 
ism which evolv“s during the period of growth is always
-P-A-G-E-45
  BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 838 
increasingly better fitted to overcome the difficulties 
that are met with in the struggle with other forces. 
The living machine automatically develops for itself 
and within itself the instruments for a more easy and 
complete mastery of what it wants. Thus we see the 
baby developing bones and muscles for walking and 
grasping that soon make him independent of mother 
and father. Meanwhile the nervous organization is 
developing to a point where the brain takes over more 
and more direction of the adolescent behavior. And 
the whole body develops with its centralizing controls 
until the boy has become an Alexander, a Cesar, a 
Napoleon, or a Christ, who conquers the world of matter 
or subdues the passions of men by his concentrated 
power of personality and by his superior understanding 
of life on its higher levels. 
e. And always, along with the possession of more efficient 
instruments for conquest, come new desires for conquest, 
and these desires rise also to higher levels as the mechan- 
ism for higher thought appears. In the lowest forms 
of life there is only a body and the desires and conquests 
are for bodily satisfactions. As the nervous system 
develops spontaneously, mental desires appear, and 
they increase in number and variety, and they rise by 
slow degrees to the more “spiritual” levels as the ner- 
vous system becomes more complex in structure and its 
interrelations become more fully established. 
f. Thus, when the nervous system has reached a suffi- 
ciently complex stage of development, self-conscious , 
mental life begins, control of self and of environment is — 
extended, and, by an increasing grasp of the meanings 
of experience, behavior is more and more guided by 
“reason”? and is less a matter of instinctive reaction to 
primitive impulses.

g. The living energy we call life has been doing its creative 
work in countless ways for a longer time than the rec- 
ords of history have been kept. There is no ground 
for any assumption that its work is confined to our 
little world or that the mechanistic form we call ‘“‘man” 
is the highest form that can be evolved, or that man 
himself may not rise to levels where he will be “‘super- 
man” in comparison with the best of our day. 
: Educational significance of some facts in the mechanistic 
conception of life 
In the foregoing pages we have been passing in review 
those facts regarding our human nature that are most 
needed to understand what is meant by the biological point 
of view which scientific thinking has established for educa- 
tion. Our review has been brief and rapid, and it is hoped 
that it will be for the reader but an introduction to the books 
of the special students in this field. References to some of 
them will be found at the end of Part I of this book. But, 
inadequate as the statement of facts is, we should not leave 
them without considering briefly their educational signifi- 
eance. To this end, we note: 
First, that our life and the life of each of our pupils de- 
velops in and by a process of strife. To speak of life as a 
“warfare” is not simply to use a figure of speech. “Life” is 
ever striving to overcome and to use for its own satisfactions 
and upbuilding as much of its surroundings as it can seize. 
Emerson saw this, although he did not know the scien- 
tific explanation, when he said: 
Life is a search for power. 
Victory over things is the office of man. 
In some sort the end of life is that man should take up the uni- 
verse into himself,
-P-A-G-E-47

We recognize the existence of this struggle when we face 
questions of right and wrong, when we must decide whether 
we shall do what we ought to do or what is easy and pleasant 
at the moment. But are we not inclined to think of these 
struggles as characteristic of the spiritual life? Do we 
realize that these moral struggles are but samples of what is 
going on within our physical bodies all the time, struggles 
and warfare of which we are seldom conscious, in the bones, 
the blood, the muscles and nerve fibers of us? 
In this particular we share the nature of the one-celled 
microscopic life forms that float in the pools of stagnant 
water by the roadside. The very beginnings of our indi- 
vidual existence are the product of the struggle that living 
germs engage in to go on living and developing. It is the 
struggle of life to realize itself in creative organization that 
evolves the baby form before birth and that develops the 
full-grown man and woman and their higher spiritual char- 
acter. Growth is due to the self-activity of vital force alike 
before and after birth. We owe to it our being. We owe 
to it what we are physically, mentally, and spiritually. 
Our moral struggles are but the projection of the warfare 
that “life” is ever waging in and between all the cells of 
which our body is built. 
We now know that there are no specific differences of kind, but 
only of degree, between the reflex activities of the protozoa and the 
highest mental processes of man, 
It is written that 
Elisha prayed, and said, Lord, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he 
may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he 
saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire 
round about Elisha.

Tf our educational eyes could be thus opened to see our 
pupils biologically, how differently we should often deal with 
them. There is Thomas and Susan, not at all what they seem 
to be to the physical eye. Each carries the marks of the 
battles waged by the vital forces that have surged through 
the bodies and minds of their ancestors during all past cen- 
turies. These marks record victories now for those forces 
that were striving to advance the race and now for those that 
were striving to retard or destroy it. These battles have 
left their scars. Yet what they are, what these children 
possess of bodily and mental strength, is due in large degree 
to this struggle of vital forces in the ongoing life of those who 
preceded them. And now, as they stand before us, there 
is being waged a struggle for mastery between the twentieth 
century and all the centuries that are past. Sometimes the 
sixteenth, the tenth, or an earlier century will win, and then 
we shall have, not a civilized boy and girl to deal with, the 
children of refined and educated parents whom we know, 
but, little savages whose forbears were dwellers in trees and 
caves, people of whom we know practically nothing. They 
are human beings in the making, and they are being fashioned 
by the very strife that we deplore. In truth, the harder the 
battles, the stronger and finer the resulting man or woman, 
provided the right forces win. And this is our task and the 
task of all others interested in Thomas and Susan, to release 
influences that will reinforce those that should win. 
The individual mind is a system of purposive forces, but the sys- 
tem is by no means always a harmonious system; it is but too apt 
to be the scene of fierce conflicts which sometimes result in the rup- 
ture and disintegration of the system.? 
The main object of an education is not to develop mental states, 
but to provide rational assistance in directing vital processes.?

This struggle of which we are speaking is not, it must be 
quite evident, one between the teacher and pupil for mas- 
tery and control of the pupil. Not that at all, but a struggle 
that is going on perpetually within the body and mind of 
every individual, in which many different forces are striving 
for mastery, and the personality is striving to assert itself 
and hold each force in its proper place. In this struggle no 
outsider can participate. Each one must fight it out for him- 
self. But another may be an ally. However, to be a help- 
ful ally, one must appreciate the nature of the conflict that 
is being waged. 
And this brings us to the next point in our consideration 
of the educational significance of the mechanistic concep- 
tion of life. We note: 
Secondly, that these contending forces that we have been 
discussing are of the nature of unsatisfied desires. Life is 
characterized by certain native impulses, called by some 
instincts, ‘by others wishes, urges, and drives. The funda- 
mental impulses are difficult to distinguish from those that 
have been acquired, for these, too, influence us powerfully. 
But the following statement points out three that are gen- 
erally agreed on as basic: 
Three primitive “drives” — one the tendency to preserve phys- 
iological balance, the second, to secure the safety of the individual, 
and the third, to insure the perpetuation of the species — are the 
dominant forces in life. 
These “drives” are coincident with the beginnings of life. 
Thinking must wait for the development of a nervous system, 
but feeling; impulse, emotion appear with the first stirring 
of life in the primitive cell. 
Before self-consciousness and a self-regarding sentiment are de- 
( veloped, conduct is determined by feelings and impulses, or by   
"1 Stewart Paton, Human Behavior, p. 32. By courtesy of Charles Scrib- 
ner’s Sons, New York.
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
ideas and the desires they arouse, either some one desire rising alone 
to consciousness and issuing at once in action, or through a conflict 
of impulses and desires, some of which eventually predominate 
over the others and determine action; but action issuing from such 
a conflict of impulses and desires is not true volition. Action is truly 
volitional only when the ideal of the self in relation to the idea of 
the end to be achieved by each of the conflicting tendencies deter- 
mines the issue of the conflict." 
The impulses that arise singly and together within us and 
within our children are not random, aimless impulses. Each 
one has a purpose, a clearly defined purpose. The purpose 
of one is to protect from harm. Danger in any form, light- 
ning, excessive cold, an onrushing automobile, disease germs, 
broken bones, and bruised muscles, overstrong light striking 
the eyes, lack of food, drink, or shelter — these and a thou- 
sand other conditions within and without that threaten the 
welfare of the body arouse the impulse to self-preservation. 
Because these impulses are at times at war one with the 
other, alike in our pupils and in ourselves, let us not forget 
that each impulse has its useful purpose. No one of them 
can be destroyed without permanent injury to the individ- 
ual. To destroy or root out one of these impulses is more 
harmful by far than to cut off a leg or an arm, or to pluck 
out an eye. 
But, it seems that “life” has within itself, as one of its 
instinctive characteristics, an impulse to regulate its own 
impulses when they become discordant. As we have noted 
before, “life” tends to build up an increasingly complex 
mechanism through which it may express itself in ever more 
refined and higher ways, and to do this it must exercise 
control over its own various impulses. How successful this 
organizing, controlling impulse, or, as Dr. Paton calls it,

“the tendency to preserve physiological balance” is when 
“life” is left to itself, can be seen in every plant that grows 
and in every animal form on land and in the sea. Each form 
comes to its proper maturity because the impulse to main- 
tain a balance of the contending impulses has been on the 
whole successful. 
We have been considering the educational significance of 
the biological or mechanistic point of view. We have seen/ _~ 
that biology shows our pupils to us as organisms developing ~ 
by a process of internal struggles. It shows us further that 
the struggles are between impulses that are characteristic 
of “‘life” itself, that each impulse has its own necessary part 
to play in a successful upbuilding of an individual being, and 
that, while impulses are often “at cross purposes,” there ig 
an organizing, controlling impulse that tends to maintain a 
balance. It is this impulse that causes growth “true to 
form,” that develops central nervous controls and ultimately 
personality with a controlling will. 
But biology points to one other consideration that is 
educationally significant. We note this as our 
Third point. It is this, that all education must be self: 
education. We may try to make men and women out of 
children by the arts of the architect, the sculptor, or the 
tailor, but we shall succeed only in deforming them. Bi- 
ology shows us that the development of mind and character 
is subject to the same laws of growth that the body is. All 
living things, including boys and girls, and men and women, 
make themselves by those powers and impulses that inhere in 
living energy, energy that is working according to its own 
nature, a creative energy in human beings, a man- and 
woman-making energy. Our best service is in codperating 
with nature as a successful gardener does and as a success- 
ful physician does. 
Some time ago the writer chanced to be walking along a  
-P-A-G-E-52

country road in a section given over to market-gardening. 
He stopped to talk with a farmer who was transplanting cab- 
bage plants in hotbeds. In reply to a remark on the amount 
of competition that the market-gardener had to meet these 
days, the farmer said: ‘‘ Well, I have been raising cabbage 
plants for more than a quarter of a century. I study them 
and I know a little more about how they like to be treated, ) 
about what gives them the best chance to grow, than any | 
one about here. I learn something new about cabbage 
plants every year.” 
To be sure, our school garden is given over to the growing 
of higher life forms than cabbage heads, but the old farmer 
has the secret of success in dealing with all living things. 
Our greatest usefulness lies in providing conditions favorable 
for growth, interfering as little as possible with the natural 
processes. 
For the pupils the essential quality of this process seems 
to be best expressed in this conception, that 
  Education is conscious or voluntary evolution.! 
Herbert Spencer had the same idea in mind when he wrote: 
All human progress has been through self-education. 
For the teacher the key to the riddle of self-education 
is this, that 
The primary root of all educational activity is in the instinctive, 
impulsive attitudes of the child, and not in the presentation and 
application of external material.? 
The place of the teacher, the kind of work which she can 
do that will be really helpful, is indicated in these words:

demic, may be described briefly as an effort to direct human activi- 
ties intelligently.t 
The following incident illustrates very clearly and simply 
what is meant by “an effort to direct human activities in- 
telligently.” = 
Directing human. activities 
There is in the city of Boston a certain small neighborhood 
grocery store owned and personally managed for many years 
by a descendant of an old New England family. The owner 
of this store, by the substantial quality of his character, by 
his genuine but restrained interest in human beings, by his 
honest dealing, had become a factor in this stable commu- 
nity, highly respected and generally relied on. 
On one side of this neighborhood store lay the homes of 
tenement dwellers of various nationalities and colors. On 
the other side were the homes of the aristocratic, well-to-do. 
The store served the patrons from both sides with equal 
fairness and human interest. 
One day a poor woman, a widow, came to make her usual 
purchases and, while being served by the owner, remarked 
sadly, ‘I suppose I must have my boy put in some institu- 
tion. He is gone all wrong and I can’t do anything with 
him. He has been getting into all kinds of mischief with 
that gang he goes around with.” 
The storekeeper knew the boy and his growing shiftless- 
ness. He was now a well-built youth of sixteen years or so, 
and had been going in and out of the store since he was old 
enough to run errands for his hard-working mother. He 
felt that the boy was worth an effort on his part, so he said, 
after some further inquiry about the boy’s life, “Send him 
to me and I will see what I can do for him.” 
The next morning the boy appeared, ragged, dirty, care- 
1 Stewart Paton, Human Behavior, p. 396.  
-P-A-G-E-54
42 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
less, indifferent, dilapidated. Without questioning or lec- 
turing, in a friendly way the storekeeper said that he needed 
some one to go about taking and delivering orders for him. 
He would like to have the boy do this work for him if he 
would. 
The wage was agreed on and the offer was accepted. 
About the middle of the morning the boy took an order to 
deliver, but did not return until the middle of the afternoon. 
The storekeeper made no comments, but studied the boy as 
he went about doing the light tasks that he set for him. 
When it came time to close the store, he had thought out a 
plan. He said to the boy, “I wish you would go home with 
me. It will give us a chance to get better acquainted, and 
perhaps my garden and chickens may interest you.” 
The boy agreed with some evident reluctance, and in due 
time they arrived at the storekeeper’s home. He left the 
boy to wander about the place while he hunted up his wife 
and explained his plan. Then he went to join the boy, and 
she hurried to his closet and bureau and selected clean under- 
clothes, a shirt, collar, tie, socks, and a good suit of clothes 
and carried them to the bathroom. According to plan, the 
storekeeper led the boy to the bathroom, filled the tub with 
water and said, “Take a good bath, throw your clothes in 
that corner, put on the clothes you see on that chair, and 
come down to the piazza where I will wait for you.” 
In the course of time the boy appeared, as to externals, a 
new boy. Now came the test of the effectiveness of this 
plan. Had it set to work influences that would start other 
and stronger desires and impulses than those that had been 
his masters before? 
Again the storekeeper did not lecture, but, facing the boy, 
he said in his friendly way, “‘Here is a chance to break with 
the boys you have been going with. I need you in the bus- 
iness. You are now clean and well clothed. Don’t you 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 43 
think you would like to live that way allthe time? What do 
you say?” 
The boy looked the storekeeper in the eyes and said, “I 
see what you mean. I will not run away again.” 
During the five years or more that have passed since that 
day, the boy has gone about his taking and delivering of or- 
ders with regularity, efficiency, and a general air of cheerful- 
ness and contentment. He is respected and trusted by his 
employer and the people whom he serves, and, if signs do not 
fail, he will soon take on the responsibilities of support for a 
fine girl in the neighborhood. 
This bit of biography is not given to exemplify the miracu- 
lous or even the unusual. It illustrates an “intelligent ef- 
fort to direct human activities.” It is “intelligent” because 
it recognized that this boy was controlled by instinctive im- 
pulses and desires. He had been following some of these. 
There were others that only needed a chance to arise into 
consciousness in order to have them possibly become the 
dominating forces in his life. The storekeeper provided the 
conditions favorable for the release of these impulses. The 
inner conflict in this case was short and decisive, but for 
the boy it was “self-education.” 
This storekeeper knew nothing of the “mechanistic con- 
ception of life” or of the “biological point of view” in educa- 
tion. But a thoughtful, sympathetic study of human nature 
had led him to this point of view and his native genius pro- 
duced a trial plan in harmony with it. He was one of those 
“natural” teachers who are the leaven of the teaching pro- 
fession to-day and who ever have been. Scientific study 
but confirms, illuminates, and improves that which experi- 
ence has shown to be sound educational practice. 
May one other observation be permitted? It was not 
the success of this plan that proved the correctness of the 
method. The method would have been just as sound, even
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
if this particular application of it had failed, because the 
method was an “intelligent effort to direct human activ- 
ity.” It was intelligent because, to repeat, it was based on 
an acceptance of the impulses and desires of human beings 
as the factors which control their lives. 
Summary of Chapter IT 
1. In the past there has been a universal prejudice against 
scientific thinking in every field. To-day that prejudice has 
disappeared except in relation to human beings and to hu- 
man affairs. In religion, morals, and the mental and social 
life of men prejudice still prevents a ready acceptance of in- 
controvertible facts that are discovered by scientific study. 
2. The prejudice arises in part from a fear that these facts 
will destroy some of our most cherished and comforting be- 
liefs regarding the origin and destiny of “mind” and 
“soul,” and in part from a repugnance to discussing our 
higher, “spiritual” concerns in terms that we are accus- 
tomed to consider lower and “material.” 
38. Nevertheless, scientific study is discovering how “life” 
acts in and through the body mechanism. It is becoming 
evident that physical and chemical influences are much 
more potent than was formerly supposed, and that much of 
human conduct can be understood only as it is seen from the 
biological point of view. 
4. It is clear that “life” is a self-active force; that it is im- 
pelled to action by primitive impulses, urges, drives; that 
the impulses, primitive and derived, are directed or pur- 
posed by desires for specific satisfactions; that the expression 
of “life” rises to higher levels — from the physical to the 
mental and spiritual — as the cellular organism or machin- 
ery develops in complexity and refinement. 
. 4 &. Progressive education accepts the facts of science re- 
garding human nature, and tries to use them in education.
-P-A-G-E-57
  BIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 45 
From these facts three basic principles are derived, namely, 
a. All education is self-education. 
b. All education has to do primarily with impulses and 
desires rather than with the presentation of material. 
c. The teacher’s task is one of directing activities in 
such a way that pupils will be self-developing person- 
alities in school as truly as they are when left to them- 
selves out of school. (The path along which this vol- 
untary evolutionary process should be “directed” will 
be considered in later chapters.) 
6. Progressive education is just real education. Science 
confirms and improves the educational policies that “nat- 
ural” teachers have always followed. Franklin “sensed” a 
correct way to direct the course of electricity stored in 
clouds; a way that was in harmony with the nature of elec- 
tricity. Steinmetz uses the general method of Franklin, but 
by reason of his greater scientific knowledge he is able to di- 
rect its course more certainly and to a larger variety of use- 
ful purposes. 
From the careful, accurate, painstaking study of human beings 
conducted along broad biologic lines there will be gathered in due 
time the information leading up to a better understanding of hu- 
man nature, its hopes, ambitions, and desires; and by following the 
path of reason we shall discover the causes of success and failure.*

  CHAPTER III 
THE SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 
Life with others is necessary to mental health and growth 
Amone the many impulses that we discover in ourselves is 
the impulse to companionship. Every one craves it. It ap- 
pears to be true that this hunger is so deep-seated in our con- 
stitution that, if it is not satisfied, our mental life actually 
disintegrates and physical health fails. People seek pro- 
longed solitude because their mind is already sick, or else in 
the hermit-life it becomes so. There are numerous illustra- 
tions of this with which most readers are familiar. 
Another indication that the spring of this impulse lies far 
below the surface is given by those who have made a special 
study of the beginnings and the development of the human 
mind. It appears that mind originates in human associa- 
tion, and that it has grown in capacity and ability by exer- 
cise in solving the problems of social organizing and in us- 
ing the social organization for accomplishing the larger pur- 
poses which arise in and because of it. This idea is clearly 
stated and illustrated by Professor Warren. He writes: 
The social environment or “social atmosphere” is much more 
important in determining the higher stages of mental organization 
than stimuli from the ordinary physical environment. Languageand 
the entire function of communication depend upon the presence of 
a social environment. It is reported that castaways show consider- 
able retrogression in mental organization. Alexander Selkirk, whose 
solitary life for over four years on Juan Fernandez Island suggested 
the tale of Robinson Crusoe, lost much of his vocabulary and his 
facility to talk connectedly. Clear thinking is apt to be impaired by 
constant solitude, though alternation of solitary and social condi- 
tions often stimulates rational thought. 
. The extent to which the development of mental life depends
-P-A-G-E-59
  SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 47 
upon social influences in childhood is shown by certain instances of 
children brought up in solitude or apart from human surroundings. 
In the case of Kasper Hauser, who was brought up apparently 
almost without social intercourse, intellectual development was 
permanently stopped. Helen Keller, cut off from human stimuli 
through blindness and deafness, made no progress in mental organi- 
zation till taken in hand by an expert teacher.! 
These illustrations show how essential social relations have 
been and are in one’s life, and they also point to the strength 
of the “urge” that drives old and young alike to association - 
with their kind. Boys must have their “clubs,” girls must 
have their “sets,” men must have their “lodges,’”’ women 
must have their “circles,” all must have their friends. How 
distracted, disorganized one becomes, how one “loses his 
head,” when he realizes that he is actually “lost” from the 
human world or separated from conscious relation in it, as 
when one is “lost in the woods,” or when a child is “lost in a 
crowd.” It has been said that those who live a segregated 
life on remote farms are more subject to mental derange- 
ment than are those who live in cities. There seems to be 
some ground for the widespread disinclination of those who 
live in crowded apartment houses to exchange their unwhole- 
some physical surroundings in the midst of a highly organ- 
ized social order for fresh air and broad fields where, how- 
ever, they will be alone with nature. The origin of this im- 
pulse seems to be a more or less undefined consciousness that 
numerous human contacts and relationships produce a life 
of more abundant satisfactions than an isolated life does. 
May this not be an instance in which the impulse of nature 
is a safer guide than the calculation of philanthropy? We 
seem to have confirmation of it in these words: 
In the individual man, it is the growing richness and accuracy of 
  
1H. C. Warren, Human Psychology, p. 398. By courtesy of Houghton

48 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
self-knowledge which alone enables him to direct his actions effect- 
ively to secure his own welfare and to improve his character and 
powers. 
The self-knowledge of the individual grows chiefly through inter- 
course with his fellows; his idea develops in fullness and accuracy in 
the light of his knowledge of other selves, and this knowledge in 
turn develops in the light of his increasing knowledge of him- 
self.t 
We are thus led to a consideration of 
The educational value of social organizing and organization 
Looking backward over the period during which the social 
order has been in the making, it appears that man has re- 
ceived his finest education while he was engaged in contriv- 
ing the different social mechanisms and while he was using 
them for advancing his higher interests. Not only has he 
discovered the limit and scope of the mental abilities that he 
already possessed at any particular time while he was work- 
ing out an ever more satisfying social order, but the work it- 
self has strengthened old abilities, has developed new ones, 
and has produced a finer mental organization. So that it 
seems not too much to say that social living and social organ- 
izing have been the chief agencies by which brute-man has 
become gentle-man. 
We can indistinctly picture early man wandering alone in 
a world of nature or with but transient family associations. 
He finds that even occasional human contacts bring satisfac- 
tions in three directions, in pure bodily pleasures and com- 
forts, in primitive mental pleasures of friendship, and in the 
consciousness of augmented power through codperative ef- 
fort. These satisfactions become lures to associative rela- 
tions with other groups for hunting or building or fighting.

-P-A-G-E-61
SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 49 
The social groups become more numerous, they become pro- 
gressively better organized and more stable. 
In some such way it is believed that the thinking ability 
of the race has developed as the growing complexity of hu- 
man relationships and the problems of associated life have 
drawn the mind into more intensive and varied uses of the 
thinking mechanism. The natural tendency of individuals 
to repeat what has proved to work well is a social tendency 
also, so that social ways settled into social mechanisms; that 
is, into customs, habits, institutions, and laws. These at 
their best became instruments for carrying on larger indi- 
vidual and group enterprises, and the larger enterprises 
spurred to more strenuous, prolonged, and varied mental ef- 
forts. In turn these extraordinary mental stresses stimu- 
lated the development of new nervous mechanisms, and of a 
better mental organization and a more perfect mental con- 
trol. 
Thus in every individual we may see a replica of the men- 
tal development in the race by means of the education de- 
rived from making and remaking social adjustments and 
from using social organization for the prosecution of super- 
individual tasks. During the first weeks and months of life 
the baby stretches out his hands and gathers for his own use 
as much of the world as he can reach. For him there is but 
one being in the world, himself, and his consciousness does 
not extend much beyond awareness of his cravings for food 
and of physical discomforts. But these bodily hungers are 
his masters and drive him to a frenzy if they are not soon sat- 
isfied, as the little one in any family exemplifies. The re- 
wards of his impulsive activities are (1) bodily comfort, (2) 
new bodily vigor, (8) new nervous awareness of himself and 
of that which is not himself. These gratifying rewards draw 
him on to yet more insistent explorations. 
If the world were all material, the baby could never feel
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 . PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
any but physical hungers and physical satisfactions. He 
would always be a brute. But in his outstretchings he dis- 
covers mother, father, brother, sister, and those other human 
beings who make up the family and neighborhood. He has 
a sense of peculiar satisfaction in his contacts with them, and 
peculiar longings for those contacts are aroused. Without 
plan or definite purpose he relates himself to them and a so- 
cial organization grows up in his consciousness of which he 
finds himself a part. How the little one tries to shape and 
reshape this family organization to conform it to his im- 
pulses and to better realize his own purposes! And perhaps 
too often and too completely for his own best interests he 
succeeds. Thus does he come to know himself, and thus do 
the currents of his living energy become educated into the 
organization of a human mind. 
Therefore our pupils should participate in forming and re- 
forming the life of their school, because of the educational 
value to them of being active in this highest of all mental ex- 
ercises, and also because a life that they have helped to or- 
ganize will be a better one for them than any that teachers 
can make alone. 
The controlling influence in society is satisfaction 
* The great task of mankind has been to create an organization 
which would enable men to realize their wishes.! 
The whole life-process, so far as we know it, whether viewed in its 
individual or in its social phase, is at last the process of developing, 
adjusting, and satisfying interests.” 
It seems more clearly evident, the further the process is 
studied by which we have arrived at the form of social or- 
ganization that we call democratic, that this process has 
been one of response to the immediate consciousness of some 
impelling need or wish. It appears that mankind has been 
1 Frederic L. Wells, Mental Adjustment, p. 958. 2 Ibid., p. 456. 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 51 
driven by the clamor of unsatisfied desires for more and bet- 
ter food, clothing, and shelter, for more power, for freedom 
from oppressive restraints of many kinds. It has been these 
basic urges that have caused the rise and fall of different 
forms of social order rather than abstract ideas of what is 
good or bad government or the ideals of philosophers and 
the dreams of philanthropists. The social order that works 
best for immediate interests has been the order that man- 
kind has ever striven to construct. 
Historically this is pictured so clearly and interestingly in 
the Bible story of the beginnings of Jewish monarchy that, 
at the risk of seeming to make a digression, the story is re- 
produced here in part. With what naive frankness the ac- 
count is given! How like children these primitive Hebrews 
were, like the children we know at home and in school! Is 
there not here a vivid illustration of progressive education 
in which the Teacher keeps hands off, but nevertheless codp- 
erates, that self-education may have its unimpeded right of 
way? 
And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons 
judges over Israel. And his sons walked not in his ways, but 
turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. 
Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and 
came to Samuel. And they said, “Behold, thou art old, and thy 
sons walk not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like 
all the nations.” 
And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto 
Samuel, “Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say 
unto thee, but they have rejected me that I should not be king over 
them. ... Now, therefore, hearken unto their voice: howbeit thou 
shalt protest solemnly unto them, and shalt show them the manner 
of the king that shall reign over them.” 
And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that 
asked of him a king. And he said, “This will be the manner of the 
king that shall reign over you. He will take your sons, and ap- 
point them unto him for his chariots and to be his horsemen, and
-P-A-G-E-64
ec ee eee ee 
52 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
they shall run before his chariots; and he will set some to plough his 
ground and to reap his harvests and to make his instruments of war. 
And he will take your daughters to be cooks, and to be bakers. 
And he will take your fields and your vineyards, even the best of 
them, and give them to his servants.” 
But the people refused to hearken unto the voice of Samuel, and 
they said, “‘Nay, but we will have a king over us that we also may 
be like all the nations.” 
And the Lord said to Samuel, “‘Hearken unto their voice and 
make them a king.” . . . . . . 
And Samuel called the people together to Mizpah. . .. And Sam- 
uel said to all the people, “‘See ye him whom the Lord hath chosen, 
that there is none like him among all the people?” 
And all the people shouted, and said, “God save the king.””? 
This demand of the Jews for a change from the theocracy 
under which they had been living to a new social organiza- 
tion arose from two impulses, a desire to be free from the op- 
pressive restraints and injustices of their present rulers, and 
a craving for national display. Their simple form of govern- 
ment with its invisible ruler no longer satisfied their awak- 
ened national consciousness. New conditions had created 
new mental states, and a new social order must be devised to 
satisfy the new outlook on life. It is significant also that 
Samuel’s theories, put forward as warnings that the new or- 
ganization would not work out to their personal advantage, 
had no influence in diverting the people from the path into 
which their inner urge had pushed them. Their instinctive 
impulse was stronger than his reasoning. They chose a 
form of government that was theoretically less desirable be- 
cause it was immediately more satisfying. | 
Satisfactions are proper guides in education 
It is probably true that these inner urges are safer guides 
to follow than are theories and philosophies. In the situa- 
11 Samuel, chaps, vitt and 1x. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  
SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 53 
tion in which the Jews found themselves in the Bible story 
we have just read, the people were doubtless right, and Sam- 
uel, who had lived his day and did not feel the impulses of 
the new generation, was wrong. There is this danger in the- 
ories, as it has been pointed out in the first chapter: they eas- 
ily become separated from what is, and the farther away 
theories are from facts, the more they interfere with them, 
misinterpret them, warp them, push them from their proper 
relations. But facts have a way of winning out in the long 
run. Such irrepressible facts are the natural impulses and 
cravings of our children. 
So we are laying stress here on the impulses that have been 
and still are basic in producing our present social order, be- 
cause progressive education is determined by the basic, in so 
far as it can be discovered, rather than by the accidental, the 
superficial, the plausible. If the real reasons for the social 
order are found in the natural cravings of our human kind, 
then we should go to these same natural cravings for the rea- 
sons by which we shall be guided in organizing the life of our 
school. Our task will be to train children to create with our 
help a social order in the school of such a sort that each one 
will find the conditions in which his normal cravings will be 
satisfied, and in which he will also become conscious of new 
impulses and desires whose gratification will be good for 
himself and for society. 
The task of education is to arouse an “interest”; i.e., attention to 
and choice of those “interests” that are socially desirable, but of 
which he may not be aware.! 
Society building is a process of adjusting 
Life is not a state, but a process of adjustment.? 
Here again we have a basic fact that should affect educa-

  oat PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
tion. Democracy is not a particular form of government or 
order of society, neither can a democratic education be pro- 
duced by the use of particular forms and formulas. Educa- 
tion in and for democracy must be of the nature of democ- 
racy itself. Now, while it is difficult to say exactly what 
democracy is, as it is difficult to say what gravity is, yet we 
may find out some things about it. 
First, it appears that the evolving process of social organi- 
zation has expressed itself in succeeding forms of which the 
democratic is the latest, although, as we shall see later, prob- 
ably not the last. The forms of past industrial, social, and 
governmental organizations are the external signs of the 
struggle that has been going on from the beginning of human 
life between the individuals and the groups to which they be- 
long. They are the adjustments that have resulted from 
time to time between conflicting interests. 
The political problem of every society is the practical one: how 
to secure the maximum values of competition, that is, personal 
freedom, initiative, and originality, and at the same time to con- 
trol the energies which competition has released in the interest of 
the community.? . 
Popular government has been usually sought and won not as a 
good thing in itself, but as a means of getting rid of tangible griev- 
ances or securing tangible benefits, and, when those objects have 
been attained, the interest in it has generally tended to decline.? 
The different varieties of democracy with which we are fa- 
miliar are then but different solutions of the same problem — 
the ever changing problem of adjusting the insistent and de- 
veloping cravings of individuals and the interests of the 
group. 
Democracy is not a fixed form 
Second, it appears that there is no more reason for think-

SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 55 
ing that democracy in any of its many forms is the final social 
order than there is for thinking that human development 
will stop with us. Viscount Bryce, after a lifelong study of 
democracies, finds no ground for positive assertion regarding 
the further evolution of social organization. He writes: 
Although democracy has spread, and although no country that 
has tried it shows any signs of forsaking it, we are not yet entitled 
to hold with the men of 1789 that it is the natural and therefore in 
the long run the inevitable form of government.!, 
Another student of history concludes that ? 
We must look forward to ever new predicaments and adven- 
tures. Nothing is going to be settled in the sense in which things 
were once supposed to be settled, for the simple reason that knowl- 
edge will probably continue to increase and will inevitably alter the 
world with which we have to make terms. The only thing that might 
conceivably remain somewhat stabilized is an attitude of mind and 
unflagging expectancy appropriate to the terms and the rules ac- 
cording to which life’s game must hereafter be played. 
The testimony of a biologist :* 
We know something about oceanic currents. Of the current of 
the evolution of life we know almost nothing. Certainly the current 
has not yet been charted. We catch glimpses of the direction of its 
sweep. Over what stormy and dangerous seas and to what undis- 
covered island or continent it is carrying us we do not know. We 
set sail millions of years ago; we shall not arrive to-morrow. 
James Bryce again: 
The civilized world seems to be passing into an unpredicted phase 
of thought and life. 
Open-mindedness toward proposals for social readjustments 
Third, it appears, therefore, that in a democracy there is a

* Modern Democracies, vol. 1, p. 11.
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
peculiar imperative to maintain an attitude of open-minded- 
ness toward proposals for readjustments. Patriotism in a 
democracy ought not to pride itself overmuch for defending 
a present status; rather it will give a sympathetic ear to the 
voices of those who feel the present adjustment oppressive in 
some way and will find its gratification in advancing orderly 
reorganizations. 
Educational significance of the social point of view 
We have referred before to the educational value for chil- 
dren of being partners with the teacher in organizing their 
school life and of using it in carrying out satisfying enter- 
prises. Now that we see that the particular form of organ- 
ized community life of which they happen to be a part is a 
temporary adjustment to give each and all of its members 
a chance to grow, it would seem that pupils should think of 
their school organization as a problem in adjustment also. 
A generation ago John Stuart Mill, in his essay On Liberty, 
wrote: 
How to make the fitting adjustment between individual inde. 
pendence and social control is a subject on which nearly everything 
remains to be done. 
Perhaps no progress has been made since this was written. 
If this is true, we cannot begin too soon to make a beginning. 
We may not teach children the specific adjustments that the 
revolving years will bring to them to make, but we can help 
them to take an open-minded attitude toward the problem- 
atic nature of organized life, we can help them to gain some 
insight into the nature of the problem of social adjustments, 
and we can give them a method of solution and some practice 
in applying the method. These values will come by their 
participation in changing the school organization from time 
to time in order to secure new and higher satisfactions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-69
  
SOCIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW IN EDUCATION 57 
To this end pupils should be led to see the likeness between 
a good school and a good community. This will bring them 
to the conception of the social order in a community as an 
unsolved problem and of our forms of national, state, and 
town government also, not as final, perfect machines made 
and delivered to us by our ancestors, but as examples of 
many ways that have grown up and that men have devised 
for living together happily. 
Respect for what is and courageous and loyal support of 
the present order is compatible with a tolerant and judicial 
attitude of mind toward proposals for change, no matter 
how far they carry us from accustomed forms and proce- 
dures — provided they are made in an orderly manner. 
For there should develop, along with this genuinely demo- 
cratic attitude of intelligent open-mindedness to proposals 
for change, an unshakable conviction that “order is heaven’s 
first law.” This is a principle of life in nature, mind, and 
society. 
From the sociological as from the biological point of view 
education is seen as self-education 
If we ask further how these conceptions of society — 
namely, that the origin of social order is in the native im- 
pulses of human life, that the controlling influences in society- 
building are satisfactions, that any particular social organi- 
zation is but one kind of adjustment for the realization of in- 
dividual and group interests, that not even are democratic 
forms permanent adjustments — if we ask how these concep- 
tions and the relation of mind-building and society-building 
affect education, we may find a thoughtful answer in these 
words: 
Democracy in education means not to impose upon others what 
we have and to make of them what we are, but so to influence them 
that they shall work out their own salvation, creating their‘own
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
character, and developing their own convictions and ideals in the 
light of the achievements of the race.* 
This seems to be a program of individualistic self-asser- 
tion, and this interpretation has given character to some so- 
called progressive schools. But thus to interpret progressive 
education is to ignore some of the most fundamental factors 
in the organized life of individuals and of society. Life must 
expand. It must be self-assertive. It must be creative. It 
must be self-organizing and self-adjusting. But in its very 
beginnings life is subject to “controls,” which are in fact the 
means by which consciousness is attained, and by which 
the individual learns how to continue his life and to direct it 
aright. Consideration of these controls will be taken up in 
the following chapter. 
Summary of Chapter IIT 
1. The impulse for human association is a characteristic 
of human nature. The response to this impulse has been the 
cause of the various kinds of social organizations in the past 
and in our day. 
The mind of man has become a human mind by reason of 
this native social quality. Separated from human associa- 
tion the mind of man loses its human qualities. 
We are led from these facts to conclude that education 
should be a socialized process. 
2. Mental power has been developed in the human race by 
social organizing and by coéperative activity in a social or- 
ganization more than by activity in and by means of the 
purely material world. Human beings have been educated 
by human beings rather than by nature. 
Therefore children should participate in making their own 
school organizations. 
8. In human society it appears that the different social

organizations have been made and unmade in response to 
the feeling of unsatisfied desires. At first this may seem to 
be a “low” kind of influence, but it has led to such social or- 
ganizations as we have, while the idealistic dreams of “think- 
ers” have up to the present time had little permanent influ- 
ence. 
We should accept life as it is and make our schools, or 
rather help the children to make them, places where de- 
veloping human beings can realize in large measure the 
satisfactions that they individually crave. 
4. The social order existing at any one time is but one 
attempt to solve the problem of adjusting individual ag- 
gressiveness and group interests. No principles have yet 
been discovered for solving this problem perfectly. Society 
is likely, therefore, to be alway: process of change as 
knowledge and conditions change. The best interests of 
society require the acceptance of this point of view and the 
cultivation of a mental attitude of intelligent tolerance 
toward proposals for change and an intelligent participation 
in orderly changes. 
“This attitude should be cultivated in children in and 
through their organized school life. It is possible to do this 
without weakening respect for and support of the present 
social order. 
5. The program of progressive education is in harmony 
with a program of sound democratic education. Both are 
determined by the basic facts of human nature as these facts 
reveal themselves in individuals and in society.

CHAPTER IV 
THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 
The meaning of freedom 
Prrwaprs no words have been more misused, or at least mis- 
understood, in the discussion of education, particularly of 
“progressive” education, than “liberty,” “freedom,” and 
“self-expression.” The implication, when these words are 
used, is that they stand for entire absence of restraint and 
control. And this meaning is assumed when they are used 
by many who are clamoring for industrial, social, capitalis- 
tic “freedom.” It is doubtless in this unrestrained sense 
that Sir Thomas Moore sang: 
From life without freedom, oh! who would not fly? 
For one day of freedom, oh! who would not die? 
It is the cry, the demand, of “life” when it feels er 
As we have seen, expansion is a quality, a characteristic of 
“life”? The exhilaration of expansion is a reward of liv- 
ing and our children should live under the stimulus of this 
reward. The ambition of a nation to be bigger and stronger, 
of a city to have a larger population, of an organization of 
any sort to extend its activities, of a person to become more 
influential, more wealthy, more learned, more skillful, the 
desire of teachers to grow in knowledge and understanding 
of their work and to rise in their profession — these are all 
the outer signs of primal impulses. When these impulses 
have acted under restraints, they have produced useful, 
organized growth. But, when in nature or in man these im- 
pulses to expansion have escaped from or have thrown off 
controlling restraints, disorganization and destruction have 
resulted. To be of use the fruit tree must be pruned, the
-P-A-G-E-73
THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 61 
privet hedge must be clipped, the cow must be stalled, the 
horse must be harnessed, the steam must be confined under 
pressure. The individual is nothing apart from the group. 
The locomotive is not “at its best?-when it is escaping from 
the restraints of the rails and flying in “perfect freedom” 
over the embankment, neither was the Kaiser nor the Czar 
most a man when he was most free “to do as he pleased.” 
Furthermore, to strive for absolute freedom is to invite 
self-destruction. The locomotive to which we have referred 
ian illustration, as is the life of every autocrat that history 
records. We are told that in past ages whole species of 
animals, in responding to their uncontrolled impulse to 
grow large and to multiply, have consumed all their avail- 
able food supply and have disappeared from the face of the 
earth by way of their own gluttony, and that large areas in 
Central Africa are uninhabited to-day because the peoples 
who formerly lived there have exterminated each the other 
in their struggles to become sole possessors where they 
might have the imaginary enjoyments that would come 
from the unrestricted control of nature’s resources. 
Any such understanding of “freedom” is not gained 
from a study of nature in any of its manifestations. Our 
universe is an orderly organization and its component parts 
are orderly systems because the forces of expansion are 
controlled by the regulating forces of contraction. If expul- 
sive forces had dominated, we should never have had a 
round world on which to live, and it would not continue day 
after day to rotate and year after year to follow its path 
around the sun. The most fundamental conditions for 
~ existence are secured to us because “in the nature of things” 
there is the system-building urge, the tendency of all ex-

up an organism through which codperative relationships may 
be maintained by centralized controls.

The same story is written in the crystalline rocks, in 
every raindrop and snowflake, and in all the manifold forms 
of plant and animal life from the lowest one-cell to the high- 
est genus of homo sapiens. If the characteristic of control 
were not master of the characteristic of expansion — that is, 
of self-assertion — all nature including ourselves would long 
ago have gone the way of sop’s frog, who, in her determina- 
tion to realize her “right of self-expression,” met a fate that 
in our childhood days we thought was well deserved. Here 
is a version of the fable with the flavor of a hundred years 
ago, the time of the publication of the collection in which it 
was found. 
Tue Frog anp THE Ox 
A frog, being wonderfully struck with the size and majesty of an 
ox that was grazing in the marshes, could not forbear endeavoring 
to expand herself to the same portly magnitude. After pufling 
and swelling for some time, 
“What think you, sister,” said she, “will this do?” 
“Far from it.” 
“Will this?” 
“By no means.” 
“But this surely will?” 
“Nothing like it.” 
In short, after many ridiculous efforts of the same fruitless pur- 
pose, the simple Frog burst her skin and miserably expired on the 
spot. 
Without inhibition no organization of a nervous system would be 
possible; and therefore we may explain again that by this term is 
meant that the operations of nervous centers, instead of being 
allowed to go too independently, are constantly controlled, re- 
strained, checked, or altogether suspended from moment to mo- 
ment, according to time needs, by the direct intervention, that is, 
“inhibition” of other nerve centers, or even sometimes by nerves 
specially endowed with this restraining power.” +

THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 63 
The regulating power is one of the fundamental properties of 
protoplasm, and forms the physical basis of life.? 
Thus nature teaches us that there is no such thing as 
unrestricted freedom, and that, whenever expansive forces 
break away from controls, chaos and disintegration follow. 
It teaches us that our universe, our world, ourselves, are 
possible only because there is “in the nature of things” this 
tendency to organized centralized controls. It is equally 
clear that “self-expression,” ‘“self-realization,” requires 
restraints as certainly as it requires opportunities for 
expression. Self-expression is intelligently self-controlled 
growth. 
How we make progress in freedom 
The great teacher and student of human nature, Paul, had 
the secret of the method by which we may effectively attain 
freedom. He writes: 
For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself serv- 
ant unto all, that I might gain the more.? 
That is it in a nutshell. We arrive at larger freedom 
by exchanging one set of controls for another. In many 
common ways we see this law at work. The little girl of 
five years has the “right” to wear her skirts above her knees, 
but this “right” carries with it restraints — she must go to 
bed early, she cannot go to big parties, she must eat at the 
side table if there must be one on Thanksgiving Day; in 
short, she must live the life of a little girl To attain the 
larger freedom of young ladyhood, when she is old enough, 
she gives up her “right” to short clothes and accepts the 
restraints of maturity. She feels these restraints at times 
as limitations to her freedom, but, as a young lady, the 
1 Stewart Paton, Human Behavior, p. 28. 
\ Corinthians, vim, 19,
-P-A-G-E-76
  64 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
childish impulses to stand on her head, to climb trees, to 
yell “at the top of her voice,” must be controlled if she would 
enjoy to the full her “rights” as a “grown-up.” 
One may take satisfaction in wearing dainty shoes, but 
if one exercises the “right” to wear them in all weathers, if 
freedom is uncontrolled, it is likely that the time will come 
when one has not freedom to wear any shoes at all. Real 
freedom in this case consists in restricting liberty, in sub- 
mitting to heavy overshoes in stormy weather, for by this 
restriction one secures prolonged enjoyment of good health, 
a higher satisfaction than the wearing of dainty shoes at 
inappropriate times. 
So, too, a nation assumes restrictions of its unlimited 
freedom in building battleships that it may enjoy the higher 
satisfactions that come with lower taxes and with inter- 
national good-will. It might conceivably exchange the obli- 
gations of a Monroe Doctrine, which it assumed a hundred 
years ago to make secure its “rights” in one section of the 
world, for the obligations of a world parliament in order to 
secure the larger freedom, rights, and satisfactions that 
come from participation in making an orderly world and in 
living in such a world. 
It seems that one, August Thyssen, shares with Hugo 
Stinnes the reputation of being the Rockefeller of Germany. 
All three of these men are free from many restrictions that 
hamper other men. But they have all “paid the price.” 
They have not become free in an absolute sense; they have 
only changed masters. It is reported that in a recent inter- 
view Herr Thyssen said: “It may be easy to envy the em- 
ployer, the so-called capitalist, for his wealth, if one consid- 
ers his life only as continuous joy and pleasure. But even 
if this pleasure should be estimated so highly it can never, 
provided it exists at all, outweigh the work and worries 
burdening those who seriously consider their position in life
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 65 
as the leading spirit in a great enterprise.” On the other 
hand, do we not know from our own observation that those 
children, and men and women also, who are most free from 
responsibility and restraints are those who in fact realize 
least the values that lie hidden in their personality? The 
forces that should go into character-building are dissipated 
for lack of organizing controls. 
But, not only does nature tend to establish controls, it 
seems also to be ever striving to set up higher and yet higher 
mechanisms of control. There appears to be a universal 
hunger in all things for the finer satisfactions that come 
through the higher freedoms secured under these higher 
directing restraints. The life of the seed does not tend to 
regress to a lower life form, but to build up and express itself 
through the higher plant form and to rise into the flower form. 
The chrysalis does not tend to exchange the restraints and 
controls of the cocoon for those of the hairy skin of the 
worm, but it tends toward the controls of wings under which 
a higher and larger freedom is enjoyed. The same tenden- 
cies have raised the life of man to its present levels. 
John Stuart Mill wrote in his discussion On Liberty: 
Desires and impulses are as much a part of a perfect human being 
as beliefs and restraints. 
This sequence of emphasis is natural when one is studying 
humanity in periods that are characterized by the oppres- 
sions of autocrats. But, as these artificial suppressions are 
removed, the other emphasis is found to be equally neces- 
sary and to be equally valid, namely, that 
Beliefs and restraints are as much a part of a perfect human 
being as desires and impulses. 
The fullest freedom comes through self-control 
We may say, then, that control of impulses in the interest
-P-A-G-E-78
66” PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
of higher satisfactions is real freedom. The moth does not 
attain freedom by yielding itself to the attraction of the 
flame. The baby does not who, snatching at its shadow in 
the pond, tumbles in. The girl does not whose impulse to 
the pleasures of the dance leads her into the immoral dance- 
hall. The boy does not attain his freedom by swaggering 
about in the gambling den and by being “man enough” to 
smoke his first opium pipe. But one is not saved in any of 
these instances, one does not secure the full enjoyment of 
freedom, by external controls. 
Those who have been much with children know that some 
of them develop “naturally” in a harmonious way. Nature 
itself has seemed in these children to have provided auto- 
matic checks and controls for impulses. Other children need 
constant assistance in order to maintain a balanced life. 
We shall not consider here how this assistance may be given, 
whether corporal punishment is a proper kind of assistance, 
but we shall put the discussion of these questions into Part 
II in the chapter on Discipline. However, it should be noted 
that personal freedom is attained only through self-control, 
that all our assistance should be to this end, and that it 
should be considered proper assistance only as its effects can 
be measured in terms of self-control. 
When therefore Madame Montessori writes: 
“The principle of liberty is not abandonment but rather one which 
will guide us to the most positive and efficacious care of the child, 
e have no longer ground for confusing the idea of liberty 
and of freedom, as it is used in her methods of education, 
with the idea of license. And these words of another inter- 
preter of the “reason” for progressive education suggest 
the kind of “care” that is “efficacious,” the kind we have 
before referred to.

THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 67 
Freedom means capacity [i.e. individual capacity] to press our in- 
stincts into service. Slavery is the domination of instincts.? 
Control essential to the development of personality 
Let us apply the foregoing ideas more specifically to 
human mental life. 
A bunch of firecrackers sputtering and exploding at ran- 
dom in a Fourth-of-July celebration is a suggestive illustra- 
tion of an animal mechanism driven by uncontrolled im- 
pulses. Babies, kicking and stretching in their cribs; kittens, 
tumbling, rolling, jumping in purposeless frolic, are other 
illustrations. But, to repeat what has been noted before, 
there is a quality in life force that tends to bring order into 
disorderly actions and the machinery of life is built up with 
a view to a more and more centralized control. In fact this 
is the main purpose of the nervous system. 
The capacity of plants and animals to readjust their activities 
when interfered with is indicative of the regulatory power which 
harmonizes and unifies all living things. We see, for example, that 
the various changes in the organism are far from haphazard, but 
proceed in a definite and orderly sequence; resulting in the forma- 
tion of specific structures and in the performance of definite actions 
time after time and generation after generation; and it is this order- 
liness, this definite procession of physical and chemical processes, 
rather than anything in the processes themselves, which is the 
most distinctive characteristic of life.” 
An important feature of living organization is that the process of 
organization is self-operating. . .. The evolution and development of 
an organism is not due to the working of some outside agency.* 
So again there is in the very nature of our being a self- 
regulating tendency to bring our conflicting impulses into an

68 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
orderly system. In and through this process of regulating 
impulses arises the consciousness of a unified self and of a 
personality. In the regulation of our impulses, in bringing 
them under control, we actually make ourselves; and we 
come to know ourselves. It has been a long process by 
which the human race has arrived at this state of centralized 
control that we call self-conscious personality. The process 
has involved chemical control and chemical adjustments, 
physical control and adjustments, physiological control and 
adjustments, nervous control and adjustments, social con- 
trol and adjustments. Each successive control and adjust- 
ment, and each successive mechanism through which control 
and adjustment have been made, has released new powers of 
vital force, has raised personality to a little higher plane of 
being. 
Personality is the result of progressive mental organization.! 
Do we not see a similar release of power for higher types 
of work in the evolution of the automobile? The first 
machine had a single cylinder of crude construction con- 
nected with roughly madeand poorly adjusted moving parts. 
These crudities made control uncertain. Power was wasted, 
work accomplished was small in quantity and unprofitable 
in quality. Gasoline, the motive energy of automobiles, 
was hampered, “enslaved” by these crudities. It has been 
set free to do its work by the development of more perfect 
mechanism; that is, more complex and finely adjusted 
machinery for control. The flying machine, the winged 
automobile, is a yet more perfect example of this law of 
development through controls. 
Lower and higher controls are often in conflict 
When we use the word lower in discussing human life, 
1 Stewart Paton, Human Behavior, p. 395. 
   
-P-A-G-E-81
THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 69 
we have in mind our animal parts, functions, and behaviors. 
We are accustomed to think of the mental life as higher than 
the animal, and of the spiritual as higher than the mental. 
Now, before birth, a baby is _predominatingly animal. He 
starts with an exceedingly limited mind. Of the aspirations 
and ideals of the spiritual life he is not at all conscious. We 
recognize the low level on which the newborn infant joins 
our family group and we treat him as an irresponsible animal. 
But we have difficulty in maintaining our attitude of just 
appraisal. After a few weeks we are inclined to assume 
that our baby has risen to a higher level than he really has. 
This assumption colors our judgments regarding his. be- 
havior. 
Our baby is to-day what his developed nervous system 
makes it possible for him to be; therefore, it will be helpful 
if we know somewhat about this development. We learu 
from the physiologist three facts that mean much for par- 
ents and teachers: 
First, the organism of a human being is under the control 
of three distinct but interrelated centers — the spinal cord, 
the old brain (cerebellum), the new brain (cerebrum). 
Second, these three centers of control do not develop to- 
gether, but one after the other. 
Third, the spinal cord has exclusive control of all animal 
functions until a brain is developed at the top of the cord. 
This first or old brain assumes control of voluntary animal 
actions. Later, the new brain, the large brain, the cerebrum 
develops to the point where conduct is directed by the dic- 
tates of a sense of right and wrong. The accompanying 
diagram will illustrate the relation of these centers. 
It is thus clear that our baby rises to higher levels on a 
ladder of ascending controls. If the higher controls are slow 
in developing, we shall be disappointed again and again in 
his behavior. His conduct will be irresponsible and im-

moral possibly; it will be impulsive rather than reflective. 
We shall be shocked, and he will be confused, if we do not 
understand that the intelligence controls are not yet fully 
developed and in good working condition.

THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 771 
* Moreover, the higher centers are never in perfect control 
of the lower. The animal in our children, and in us all, 
the primitive, the basic forces are always asserting them- 
selves, and many, many times they force the higher centers 
to yield their proper mastery to the older centers of un- 
reflective, impulsive response to lower appetites and wishes. 
No one of us need search far to find samples of these con- 
flicts in which now the higher and now the lower control is 
victorious. The baby is just beginning to understand that 
he must not throw the dishes from the table to the floor, 
but he delights in the crash and in the hurry and excitement 
that it causes. There he stands poised between the satisfac- 
tions of sense and the desire for mother’s approval. The 
decision will be made in terms of brain development. The 
boy who plays truant is the boy whose lower physical con- 
trols of the old brain are yet stronger than the controls of 
the new brain. All of this has been tragically portrayed by 
Stevenson in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, who are but symbolic 
of the struggle that we are all conscious of to “keep down” 
in their proper place the primitive animal impulses and 
desires, for to let them have dominion over us is to deliver 
ourselves over to the controls that made beasts of our pred- 
ecessors. For ourselves it may be assumed that our higher 
control centers are sufficiently developed for the regulation 
of a moral life. But with our children it is different. Their 
higher controls are in process of development, and this we 
should take into our reckoning when we judge them. 
Man is but one link in the animal series. The greater correla- 
tion, codrdination, and association of his mental processes is 
marked by increased intelligence. His progress in civilization is 
also due to the gradual extension of this intelligence and to the 
subordination of the voluntary responses to rational control. The 
highest type of personality is therefore to be regarded as the pro- 
duct of the forcible control of all voluntary activities by intelligence.!

ner’s Sons, New York.

  12 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
The physiological drama of these controls has been written 
interestingly for us by Dr. William H. Thomson: 
The cord might say to the brain, “If you wish to move hand or 
foot you have to ask me to do it for you.” “ Very well, then, do it,” 
is the brain’s answer, “but don’t you move hand or foot till I tell 
you, for since I have been evoluted up here, you have lost your 
senseless independence and must obey me. You were the original 
nervous system, to be sure, just as there were horses before there 
were men to ride them, but since I have come, I am above you and 
you are below, and, as it is, it took me long patient training and a 
great deal of trouble to break you into my service, so that you 
would act according to my orders.” } 
Different kinds of controls that develop personality 
In the foregoing section we have been considering the 
growth of controls within us that produce our sense of a 
unified self, and that cause us to rise to higher levels of in- 
telligent living. But the world of nature bristles with con- 
trols also. The baby soon learns that gravity has him in its 
grip. The wind compels him to hold tight the string of his 
kite. The heat drives him away from the blazing fire. He 
must adjust himself to all nature with which he comes in 
contact. Nature is ignored at his peril. Trifling with the 
facts of nature brings its punishment in the form of frost- 
bitten or burned fingers, broken bones, and a great variety 
of other physical ills. ‘ 
Thus, nature has waked us up, has made us aware of some- 
thing, not ourselves, that must be reckoned with. It has 
challenged us to a struggle. Many times, of course, man- 
kind has been overwhelmed by nature, but on the whole he 
has conquered. Fire imprisoned in stoves has warmed him 
and cooked his food. Cold imprisoned in refrigerators has 
preserved his perishable food and clothing. Water im-

prisoned in reservoirs has done his work. He comes to a 
river that he cannot cross. The restraint irks him. He 
builds a bridge or a boat and thus conquers it. He comes to 
a mountain that he cannot easily climb. He bores a hole 
through it, and, thus mastering it, he goes his way. And 
every time man meets a new control in nature, he “gathers 
himself together” for a concentrated attack. Thus he 
comes to know himself and his powers more surely, thus 
he develops his powers more fully, thus he centralizes his 
personal controls more completely. The controls, the 
hindrances of nature, are positive factors in developing 
personality. 
And the world of human beings is alive with controls for 
each one of us. One cannot go to school to-day because 
mother is sick. One cannot travel this year because the 
family needs the money. One cannot cut down a tree by 
the roadside because it is against the law. Laws, customs, 
institutions, traditions, public opinion, all make us pause. 
We “stop, look, and listen” before we act in unconventional 
ways. ‘These are controls that center our thought, give us a 
more lively awareness of ourselves, of others, and of conse- 
quences. We find, too, that the ambitions, hopes, fears, 
joys, and sorrows of others are controlling influences. They 
limit and direct, they focus our self-consciousness. And 
these controls, like those in nature, engage us in struggles 
whose issue may leave us stronger and better, or, to be sure, 
if the battle goes against us, may leave us crushed by the 
roadside. 
The problem of adjusting self-ecpansion to controls 
It thus seems to be true that a righteous life — that is, a 
right life — one that is finding its satisfactions on ever 
higher levels, such a life is a continuous compromise, a never- 
ending adjustment in which the controls of self, of nature, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86

4 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
and of society are understood, respected, and accepted, but 
in which the urge of inner impulses are also understood, 
respected, and accepted. This double attitude will result 
in a legitimate effort to modify external controls in the in- 
terests of a larger selfhood, and in a judicious self-restraint in 
the interests of society. 
Bertrand Russell has written suggestively on this problem 
of self-expansion and the controls about which we are think- 
ing here. He is trying to arrive at a workable answer to the 
question, “What can we do for the world while we live?” 
He says that, in judging what is best to do at a given time, 
we should keep in mind two principles, namely, these: 
1. The growth and vitality of individuals and communities is to 
be promoted as far as possible. 
2. The growth of one individual or one community is to be as 
little as possible at the expense of another.! 
He says further: 
The combination of our two principles is not in practice an easy 
matter. Much of the vital energies of the world runs into chan- 
nels that are oppressive.” 
  We are reminded of the Biblical injunction to love our 
neighbors as ourselves, and of this other, that we are all 
members of one body. The middle road between controlling 
and being controlled is the road of largest freedom, and of 
fullest development of personality. 
Summary of Chapter IV 
1. There is no support in the nature of man or of society 
for the idea that human “freedom” means absence of con- 
trol. The world of nature, the life of individuals, and of 
1 Bertrand Russell, Principles of Social Reconstruction, p. 227. 
2 Ibid., p. 229.
-P-A-G-E-87
  THE PLACE OF CONTROL IN EDUCATION 15 
human society are alike built on a plan of checks and bal- 
ances. 
Freedom has been achieved, and is being progressively 
achieved, by adjustments of individual impulses, and group 
impulses to the restrictions that are discovered (a) within 
the individual and the group itself, (b) in nature, and (c) in 
the impulses of other individuals and groups. 
By these very restrictions an individual comes to know 
himself and to be a centralized personality. 
2. In meeting these restrictions, man has developed 
higher and higher codrdinating mechanisms and a conscious- 
ness rising to the spiritual plane, until he finds himself pos- 
sessed of intelligence to judge what it is right to do and a 
concentration of personal energy to do the bidding of intel- 
ligence. This line of progress has been characterized by 
constant struggle with the limitations of self, of nature, and 
of society, something in the constitution of things tending all 
the time to create and maintain an orderly ongoing toward 
a more complete and a more conscious unity. 
8. So far, then, from restrictions, limitations, controls 
being evils, they have been our salvation. That child is the 
most unfortunate who has least controls. He is deprived of 
the only possible means of knowing himself, of becoming a 
fully developed personality, of rising to the level of intelli- 
gent self-direction. From this level we can see the “give- 
and-take” that makes for the best living, and can give assent 
to the judgment that 
He that saveth his life shall lose it, but he that loseth it for my 
sake and the gospel’s (i.e. the higher values) shall find it. 
It is toward this kind of understanding of our relationship 
in a centrally organized, a centrally controlled universe, it is 
toward this kind of participation in a common world life, 
that we seem to be under obligation to direct our children.

CHAPTER V 
HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 
Mental training should conform with nature 
Ir a teacher should be asked what she considered the main 
purpose of her school-teaching to be, she would reply, would 
she not? “To train the mind and character of my pupils.” 
We work very hard at this double task and much of our 
effort seems to be exerted with little effect. Our pupils’ 
minds seem to become “trained” in spite of and outside of 
our “methods,” as is illustrated by this interesting bit of 
autobiography: 
When I was a child, attending the first classes of the elementary 
schools, there was a kind teacher who was very fond of us. Of 
course, she kept us captive and motionless on our seats, and talked 
incessantly herself, though she looked pale and exhausted. Her 
fixed idea was to make us learn by heart the lives of famous women, 
and more especially “heroines,” in order to incite us to imitate 
them. She made us study an immense number of biographies in 
order to demonstrate to us all the possibilities of becoming illus- 
trious and also to convince us that it was not beyond our powers to 
be heroines, since these were so numerous. The exhortation that 
accompanied these narratives was always the same: “You too 
should try to become famous. Would not you too like to be 
famous?” 
“Oh, no!” I answered one day dryly, “I shall never do so. I 
care too much for the children of the future to add yet another 
biography to the list.” 1 
The “self-expressive” little girl, who thus impertinently 
took her teacher to task, later became Madame Montessori, 
probably the only one of that teacher’s pupils who ever

-P-A-G-E-90
    78 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
“became famous.” It is quite evident that at least one 
pupil was not intellectually and morally ruined by a poor 
method of teaching. Life has a way of its own and it goes 
its own way with a tendency to disregard what is not useful 
for its nourishment. It is unaffected by unskillful attempts 
to “educate” unless those attempts are so persistent and 
forceful that they break down the natural resistance. Hu- 
man beings come through a good deal of well-intentioned 
educational abuse without apparent injury, just as puppies 
and kittens seem not to suffer permanently from the rough 
handling of their baby masters and mistresses. It would 
seem that Indian babies should become permanently crip- 
pled by being strapped in their cradles where they can hardly 
move hand and foot. But Nature asserts herself when the 
baby is released and the damage seems to be made good. 
We may assume that methods of education which do not 
conform with the nature of “life” are like diseases. The 
strong “throw them off” and the weak succumb. In former 
times ninety per cent of people afflicted with tuberculosis 
died under the then prevailing treatment of closed windows 
and limited feeding. In the case of the other ten per cent 
Nature was strong enough to overcome the disease and the 
wrong method of treatment. Mothers are learning how the 
bodies of their children grow and they are casting aside 
swaddling bands and are adopting methods of feeding and of 
care that are in harmony with the nature of physical growth. 
Teachers are just beginning to study the nature of mind or 
intelligence growth, that they, too, may devise methods that 
will codperate with Nature and not go counter to it. 
The students of individual and social intelligence have 
made progress in recent years in revealing some basic facts 
regarding the conditions favorable and unfavorable for its 
growth and some characteristics of its growth. We will now 
consider a few of these facts that seem to be especially related 
to education.

Thinking is related to nervous action 
We are told that no one has yet been able to discover 
thought in himself or in others apart from nervous action. 
We repeat what has been noted in a previous chapter, that 
to say this is not the same as saying that thought may not go 
on independently of the nervous machinery and of its 
activating energy in the body. That question is apart from 
the practical one of how thinking is carried on in and by 
means of the body. This latter is the important question 
for us teachers. 
Professor Thorndike has written in his Elements of Psy- 
chology that 
      
   
                              
    The proper way to realize the nature of the human nervous 
system, the way its infinite multitude of nerve strings is arranged, 
the currents or stimuli which they transmit and the way these are 
aroused by happenings in the sense organs and in turn arouse 
movements of the body — to realize, in short, the part played in 
human life by the nervous system — is to spend a year or more in 
the study of the histology and physiology of the brain. 
Now few of us can do that, but we can train ourselves to 
view our pupils’ thinking and behavior as conditioned by the 
nervous system. The more we get in the habit of studying 
and judging them thus, the more we shall be able to under- 
stand them truly. 
Learning to speak words 
Let us follow the accompanying diagrams as we consider 
‘what happens when we learn a word. 
Diagram I. The sound of the word, let us say, “bottle,” 
strikes the ear-drum. The sound waves stimulate nervous 
lenergy that travels (so we say in the absence of knowledge of 
just what happens) along the nerve fibers to the “Hearing 
enter.” This center is stimulated and the baby “hears,”
-P-A-G-E-92
  80 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
but only a general or “mere” sound. The stimulation is 
passed along other nerve fibers to the “Motor Center,” from 
which it is transmitted to the organs of speech and the baby 
produces as well as he can the sound that was registered at 
the “Hearing Center.” But his vocal organs are unde- 
veloped and at best the sound was not precisely registered, 
and he says “bot.” In the same vague way he hears and

says “muk,” and when these sounds have been connected 
often enough with a real bottle of milk, at feeding time he 
cries out with great energy, “Bot muk!” “Bot muk!” 
Our baby would not get as far as this, it is evident, (1) 
unless the Ear Mechanism was in good condition; (2) unless 
there had been developed a “Hearing Center” and a “Motor 
Center”; (3) unless nerve fibers had been developed along 
which the impulse could be carried from the Ear to the 
“Hearing Center,” to the “Motor Center,” to the Vocal 
Organs; and (4) unless the Vocal Organs had been developed 
and were in good working order. 
Diagram II. This suggests how new centers and nerve 
connections are developed in the brain so that in time the 
baby is able to hear distinctly and to say, “Bot-tle.” 
Diagram IIT. This suggests the development of centers 
and connecting fibers for hearing and saying clearly two 
connected words, as, “My kitty.” Three such groups of 
centers, with their fiber connections and all connecting with 
the Motor Center for speech, would be necessary before the 
baby could say distinctly, “Bottle of milk.” 
What an inconceivably complex mass of centers and con- 
nections there must be in the brain to make it possible for us 
to converse with words that we have learned by hearing! 
But besides hearing words, we see them, and a different set 
of centers must be developed for the words seen, and these 
in turn must be associated with the “Hearing Center.” 
The sense organs of Taste, Touch, and Smell, each has its 
own receiving centers in the brain and each is connected up 
with all the other Sense Centers and with the various Motor 
Centers through which action is stimulated and controlled. 
Professor Thorndike says: 
Even if we knew the exact arrangement of each nerve fiber in a 
man’s brain, it would take a model as large as St. Paul’s Cathedral 
to make them visible to the naked eye. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
This is a very unsatisfactory glimpse into the very won- 
derful mechanism of our mental life. But is it not enough to 
make somewhat real the statement that, when nerve energy 
flows (if we may use that term) along the connecting fibers 
of the brain from center to center, we are thinking? When 
these currents cease, we stop thinking, for these simple il- 
lustrations of the way we think words are illustrations also 
of the way we do all our thinking. 
Our intelligence not one, but many 
It is very clear, is it not, from our glimpse into the ma- 
chinery of thinking that we do not think and that we cannot 
think sounds unless the Sound Centers are developed in the 
brain and the proper nerve-fiber connections are established. 
So, if I lack musical intelligence, it is because I lack a proper 
brain development in the sound areas. To be musical my 
brain must be stimulated by sounds until the proper Sound 
Centers are developed and the proper connections are estab- 
lished with other centers. 
In a similar way I come to have intelligence in matters of 
form and color; in matters of taste and smell; in matters of 
touch. And in just this way also do I develop a separate 
brain for language, for number, for business, for religion, for 
politics, and for all the other interests regarding which I set 
myself to be intelligent. 
So it is quite understandable that a person may be intel- 
ligent in the grocery business and quite unintelligent in the 
coal business, and that a man may be very successful in 
making money, but not at all successful in investing it. A 
teacher may be highly intelligent in teaching mathematics 
and quite incompetent in teaching art or literature. A 
woman may be a fine cook, but a poor dressmaker. In all 
these cases where intelligence is lacking, it must be evident 
that it can arrive only by way of brain development, by way
-P-A-G-E-95
  HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 83 
of activating new nerve centers and of setting up a new sys- 
tem of connecting fibers. When this has been done, and in 
proportion as it is well and extensively done, we come to have 
“a mind” or “‘an intelligence” broad and substantial in any 
field of thought. 
One’s “intelligence,” then, is not one, but many. It is 
one only in the sense that the United States is one country 
—a large number of intelligences under one central control. 
Thus centrally controlled our different intelligences combine 
to make our personality. Our personality is “rich” in pro- 
portion as we have built up or developed a large variety of 
intelligences, and herein lies the importance of the “en- 
riched”’ courses of study that are so difficult to administer, 
and the importance of the general “culture” collegiate 
course as a basis for special professional study. 
The development of intelligence is the development of the 
recognition of meanings 
When a “landlubber” embarks upon a sea voyage for the 
first time, he is entering a new world. He starts as an 
“ignoramus,” a person lacking a mind in matters of the sea. 
He has as little intelligence in this to him new environment 
as an infant who has just embarked upon his life’s journey 
has in matters of this world. The traveler must develop his 
sea-mind in the very same way that the infant develops his 
mind. : 
At first his sense organs are beset with numberless im- 
pressions that are transmitted to the various sense centers in 
the brain. Very likely there will be some impressions for 
which no center has been yet developed and he will be blind 
and deaf to some things that later he will be aware of. Let 
us select a group of these impressions and note how they 
become filled with meaning. 
Our traveler is standing by the captain as the ship ploughs
-P-A-G-E-96
    84 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
its way through the water. There is a cloud on the horizon. 
To him it is not significant. He has no mind with which to 
see it, and he is hardly conscious that there is a cloud there. 
A breeze blows on his face, but he does not notice that either. 
It is to his consciousness just an agreeable sensation. But 
the captain glances with increasing intentness at the cloud. 
He watches the direction in which the flag at the masthead is 
blowing. His ear catches the whistle of the rising wind in 
the rigging. He says to the mate: “The wind is in the north- 
east. That cloud means that we shall have a storm to-night. 
Reef the sails and batten down the hatches.” 
Note the picture — two men facing the same facts, sub- 
ject to the same sense impressions, but one has discovered the 
meaning of the facts; that is, he has seen the relations that 
make the facts significant. This is understanding. In this 
case the captain made skillful use also of his knowledge, and 
this is wisdom. He is intelligent, he has a mind in matters of 
weather. He is “‘weather-wise,” as we say. 
How may our traveler come into possession of a weather- 
mind? How may he develop weather-intelligence? There 
is but one way, namely, the way the captain developed 
his weather-mind. It cannot be implanted by descriptions, 
pictures, or word explanations. The traveler must be in- 
volved in similar situations where he will make repeated 
attentive observations of weather facts with a view to using 
them. The captain may direct his observation, he may 
shorten the process of intelligence development by sugges- 
tion, but the traveler must focus his own attention on the 
weather facts so that weather sense impressions may make 
their way to and stimulate the appropriate sense centers in 
his brain. The proper connections must be established be- 
tween the sense and the motor centers. Thus the brain 
areas are stimulated to their specialized developments and 
the traveler has the beginnings of a weather-mind. From
-P-A-G-E-97
  
ee HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 85 
the simple beginnings it may be built up to the limit of its 
capacity for development in this field. 
We are familiar with the story of the business man who, 
after a visit to one of the great art galleries of Paris, re- 
marked, “Them frames must have cost a heap of money.” 
This man had not really seen the pictures at all. He had no 
mind that could perceive them. But he did have a highly 
developed money-mind. The frames, therefore, had mean- 
ing for him in money terms. 
Illustrations of this fact that developing intelligence is the 
developing recognition of the meanings of things might be 
multiplied indefinitely, for it is the process by which each of 
us has become intelligent in all the matters with which we 
are concerned. 
Progressive education, then, is the process of enriching, 
enlarging, and multiplying one’s understanding of the world, 
and of developing wisdom in applying this understanding in 
useful ways. It thus appears that isolated facts and mere 
words have no place or use in education. 
Personality and intelligences 
What a person is is determined by the number, the kind, 
and the quality of intelligences that have been developed, 
for, as we have seen, personality is the centrally controlled 
and directed organization of the different minds that exist 
at any time. The stimulation of a new brain area (another 
way of saying the development of a new mind), or the con- 
sciousness of new meanings in familiar facts changes the 
character of our personality in some degree. H. G. Wells, 
in Joan and Peter, writes: 
A man becomes a different man, however slight the difference 
may be, when for the first time he learns the law of gravitation. 
Doubtless Newton was a different man after he recognized 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
86 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
the new meaning in a falling apple, namely, that here the 
same force was at work that held the planets in their courses 
in the heavens. 
Were we quite the same person that Christmas-time after 
we discovered that Santa Claus was father “dressed up,” 
that we were when Santa Claus meant to us a mysterious, 
deer-driving, chimney-climbing, grandfatherly dispenser of 
gifts from a far-away place in the frozen North? 
Intelligence in matters of conduct is “morality” 
In Chapter III we have discussed the significance of 
human relations in the mental life of individuals and have 
pointed out the importance of socialized activities in educa- 
tion. It is the purpose here to call attention to the fact 
that children come to school with minds organized and “set”’; 
that is, with fixed social attitudes, due to the influences of 
the customs and sanctions of the social standards and points 
of view that prevail in the group of which they have been 
members. The number and kind of different minds and the 
organization of these minds into a personality are due largely 
to these relationship influences. 
This is particularly true of their social mind. A child 
reared in a large crowded tenement has a very different 
social mind from that of one brought up in a remote rural 
section. There is no sense of wrong in the consciousness of 
the mountaineer feudist when he shoots a member of his 
enemy’s family from ambush. In fact his “conscience” 
troubles him if he does not shoot him. Truth-telling is not 
obligatory for the child whose parents and friends are saying 
what isnot true whenever it meets their convenience. Swear- 
ing is an innocent form of slang for the boy or girl who lives 
among those who swear constantly in ordinary conversation. 
Stealing is not wrong for one reared as was Oliver Twist. 
But, besides the general influences that have tended to
-P-A-G-E-99
a HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 87 
establish the character of the social mind of our pupils, there 
are also the special influences that are exerted by any special 
group to which they may belong. The customs, sanctions, 
and penalties of a gang, a club, a society, a corporation, a 
union, are often far stronger influences than are those of the 
family or of society in general. That becomes right for any 
member of such a group which the group approves, be it 
lying, stealing, killing, praying, singing, dancing, wearing 
strange uniforms, giving to charity and missions, or number- 
less other things that might be mentioned. That, on the 
other hand, is wrong that incurs the disapproval of the 
group. 
We should not misrate these influences even when the 
effects are most distressing. Not to “play the game” with 
one’s group is to be cast out from it as a traitor, a scab, a 
deserter. The hand of every other one in the group is 
against the “deserter.” For a child to be thus driven out of 
his group because of non-conformity may cause him per- 
manent mental harm. The writer knew of such a child in 
his youth who for a number of years was thus excluded from 
his little neighborhood club because he was not allowed to 
engage in certain of its social activities. Unquestionably 
the social aloofness and timidity of this person in later years 
was due in no small measure to this early experience. 
The story of the development of different kinds of social 
minds under the influences of different social customs is most 
interesting, and, as we shall see later, it is a story with which 
children should become familiar in school. Here, however, 
we can but point out a few facts significant for education. 
1. “Morality” is what any one thinks is right in mat- 
ters of conduct. 
2. What one thinks is right is due to the kind of social 
mind one has at a given time. 
3. The kind of social mind one has is due largely to the in-  
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
fluences of the social groups of which one isa member. This is 
most often determined by accident of birth or circumstances. 
4. What is right in the mind of one may be wrong, there- 
fore, in the mind of another. Right and wrong are related 
to the standards of conduct and to the social approvals to 
which we are accustomed. 
5. A teacher has been subject to these formative influ- 
ences as completely as her pupils have been. She is not jus- 
tified in thinking that her pupils are immoral because they 
act contrary to her standards. If she possesses a superior 
social intelligence, as she doubtless does, it is her task not 
to condemn, but to set influences at work that will start a 
process of reconstruction and of upbuilding of the social 
minds of her pupils. 
The missionary goes into heathen lands to start a process 
of reconstruction of religious minds. That the human mind 
is capable of being remade in all of its special phases explains 
the possibility of progress in human affairs. 
6. But he or she is a poor director of social mind building 
whose own social mind, that is, whose “morality,” has be- 
come fixed, cast ina mould. We live in a changing world. 
What was right one thousand, one hundred years ago may 
be wrong to-day. Card-playing, billiards, dancing, theater- 
going were considered wrong by our forefathers, while get- 
ting drunk was a harmless recreation that every gentleman 
should indulge in occasionally. Most of our industrial 
difficulties are due to the fact that few employers or em- 
ployees have an industrial intelligence adapted to regulate 
human relations in our modern world. The industrial world 
has changed faster than their industrial mind. 
The function of social intelligence and the teacher’s social mind 
The true work of the social mind is thus set forth by a 
profound student of human affairs:
-P-A-G-E-101
  HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 89 
Reason [i.e., intelligence] was born, as it has since discovered, 
into a world already wonderfully organized, in which it found its 
precursor in what is called life, its seat in an animal body of un- 
usual plasticity, and its function in rendering that body’s volatile 
instincts and sensations harmonious with one another and with the 
outer world on which they depend.* 
And Edman in quoting this passage adds: 
Our chief aim in reflective behavior is to discover ways and 
means by which a harmony may be achieved, a harmony of those 
very instincts which, left to themselves, would be in perpetual 
collision, frustrating and checking each other.? 
Can a teacher engage in reconstructing and in developing 
the social mind of his pupils to the end that they may be able 
to use their social intelligence in harmonizing the conflicting 
interests in their world now and in the future, unless his own 
social intelligence, his own “morality,” is adjustable and in 
process of constant readjustment? 
When we observe that morals is at home whenever considera- 
tions of the worse and the better are involved, we are committed 
to noting that morality is a continuing process, not a fixed achieve~ 
ment. Morals means growth of conduct in meaning,...It is 
learning the meaning of what we are about and employing that 
meaning in action.* 
Feeling 1s a factor in the growth of intelligence 
Think over carefully all the subjects that are open to you. 
Select the one you dislike most and take as much of that as the 
college offers. 
This was the customary advice that President Seelye of 
Amherst College used to give to students fifty years ago. 
That a study was cultural in proportion as it was distasteful

was a common notion of teachers of a Puritanic past. For 
one who would “buckle down” to a hard task, just because 
it was hard and distasteful, provided he were strong enough 
to arrive at a successful issue, there may be large good await- 
ing in following President Seelye’s advice. But there can 
come only the feeling of discouragement and of failure to one 
who finds himself bound to a weight that he can by no means 
in his power lift. It is scarcely less depressing to be engaged 
in doing things that seem not to be worth while. 
The anecdote, told, as the writer believes, by the late 
Alexander Agassiz, illustrates this fact. It seems that, 
while Mr. Agassiz was superintendent of the Calumet and 
Hecla mines, he became convinced that there was copper in 
an undeveloped region near by. It was important that his 
conviction should not be known, and he devised a plan by 
which he would take a laborer not connected with the mines 
to the place to dig for him. So he engaged an Irishman 
and they repaired to the selected spot. “Dig there,” said 
Mr. Agassiz, pointing to the place he wanted to prospect. 
The man dug until he was waist-deep in a hole. Then he 
straightened up and said, “What am I diggin’ fur, Mister?” 
“Never mind what for,” said Mr. Agassiz; “just keep dig- 
ging.” Patrick bent his back to his task again, but, when 
he had sunk the hole so that his head was about to disappear 
below ground, he straightened up again and said fiercely, 
“Mister, I want to know what I’m diggin’ here fur. I feel 
like a dom fool jest diggin’ mesilf into the ground.” “If 
you aren’t being paid enough, I’ll double your wages,” 
said Mr. Agassiz. ‘That ain’t it,” snapped out the irate 
\ Trishman; “I'll dig no more till I know what it’s fur.” And 
he shouldered his pick and shovel and strode back to town. 
Patrick was not in school, so he could refuse to do a piece of 
work that to him was foolishness. 
In the past the education of the schools has been for 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 91 
many children an education in bearing defeat, a training in 
concealing humiliation. The natural growth of the mind is 
retarded in such schools. It is important that we who teach 
should realize that feeling is a factor in the growth of in- 
telligence. 
Mental and physical feelings are correlated 
We are accustomed to be guided in our eating and drink- 
ing by our feelings — we eat when we are hungry and we 
drink when we are thirsty. We put on warmer clothes 
when we feel chilly, and we take them off when we feel un- 
comfortably warm. We say we are well when a comfortable 
feeling pervades our body. In general we accept feeling as 
the proper and safe guide in matters pertaining to the body. 
We believe that we are justified in doing this because we 
know that biologically feeling has been the “‘ watch-dog” of 
life — growling, barking, and causing us to draw back from 
what was harmful to the organism, and wagging its tail in 
welcome to what was useful and satisfying. 
But when it comes to education we have said, in effect, 
“Children’s feelings have nothing to do with their mental 
growth. To be sure it is well that they should be physically 
comfortable in school, but thinking is another matter. Feel- 
ing has no place here.” Indeed, is it not true that we have 
assumed that there was no such thing as thought-feeling? 
So far is this from the facts that it is probably true that 
there can be no growth in thinking ability except when think- 
ing is accompanied by a sense of pleasure and that there can 
be no growth in morality except when moral conduct is 
accompanied by a feeling of satisfaction. 
Here is a statement of the effects of feeling on the body: 
Pleasure causes dilatation of the blood-vessels; the circulation, 
and consequently all the functions of secretion and assimilation are 
facilitated; the face is suffused with color, the gastric juice and the 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 PROGRESSIVE EDUCA'TION 
saliva are perceptible as that healthy appetite and that watering 
of the mouth which invite us to supply fresh nourishment to the 
body; all the tissues work actively to expel their toxins, and to as- 
similate fresh nourishment; the enlarged lungs store up large quan- 
tities of oxygen, which burn up all refuse, leaving no trace of poi- 
sonous germs. It [pleasure] is an injection of health.t 
Pleasure is an indication of healthy functional activity; it al- 
ways accompanies exercises which are useful to the organs of the 
body. : 
Unpleasure in any of its numerous forms, weariness, anger, grief, 
pain, produces just the opposite effects, contracting of blood- 
vessels, slowing down of blood circulation, reducing flow of saliva 
and gastric juice, inducing indigestion, effects that induce lassitude 
and indifference.? 
We shall make little progress in bettering education until 
we become accustomed to picture children’s thinking and 
conduct in physiological terms. Thinking and conduct are 
not activities distinct from or separated from the body. 
Our mental life is intimately bound up with, and to a great 
extent conditioned by the processes of the nervous system, and. 
therefore it cannot be understood without the aid of knowledge of 
those processes.* 
To every thought which passes through the mind, to every feel- 
ing on the fringe of consciousness, and to every reflex movement of 
which we are unconscious, there corresponds a “nervous impulse” 
traveling swiftly along a series of nerve elements.* 
The growth of intelligence and of “morality” seems 
clearly to be dependent upon the progressive development 
of mechanistic controls and these controls have developed 
by way of adjusting life to the enjoyment of ever higher and 
more socialized pleasures. Whatever in this process of 
growth has tended to diminish the feeling of pleasure has

tended also to reduce mental activity and to produce aver- 
sion, first in the grosser physical structures and then in the 
finer mechanisms of thought. 
It is only when people find pleasure in the right actions that they 
can be depended upon to perform them.! 
Mental satisfaction in school tasks difficult to secure, but _ 
educationally necessary 
This is a hard saying for us to interpret in ways that will 
work successfully in school, because the essence of satisfac- 
tion in thinking, as it is in playing games and in teaching 
school, is a consciousness of success or of anticipated success. 
It is the beginning of interest and attention and it is the sole 
condition for prolonged mental effort. It is a hard saying 
because, as we sincerely try to provide mental tasks for our 
pupils that are really worth doing, that appeal to them as 
useful and at the same time that are of a sort to be com- 
pleted successfully by all, we discover the great variety of 
minds that they possess. Yet, that we are not excused from 
making this our constant problem, is shown by these strik- 
ing words of thoughtful people: 
At bottom everything depends on the presence or absence of one 
single element in the soul— hope. All the activities of man... 
presuppose a hope in him of attaining an end. Once kill this hope, 
and his movements become senseless, spasmodic, and convulsive, 
like those of some one falling from a height.” 
No one can strive for the fulfillment of a purpose, if its fulfill- 
ment will not bring him satisfaction. But anticipated satisfaction 
is nothing less than hope.* 
A life full of inhibitions is likely not to remain a very vigorous 
life, but to become listless and without zest. Impulse tends to die 
when it is constantly held in check; and if it does not die, it is apt

to work underground, and issue in some form much: worse than 
that in which it has been checked.! 
Summary of Chapter V 
1. Physical training has become more effective in recent 
years because more is known about the nature of the body 
to-day than was known formerly and training methods 
have been devised that work codperatively with the phys- 
ical nature. To be effective, methods of mental training 
must codperate with and not antagonize the nature of the 
mind. Such methods must be devised in the light of the 
recent knowledge made available by students of the mental 
life. 
2. It appears that thinking in all its manifestations is in- 
volved in and involves nervous action. In order to think 
in any field nervous centers must be activated and connec- 
tions between centers must be established. 
8. The sense centers and the motor centers with their 
connections become organized into a system, and a “mind” 
is thus formed in this field. This nervous organization in 
action is organized thinking or intelligence. 
4. For every different kind of sense impressions a distinct 
system of nerve centers and connections must be developed 
in the brain, so that, instead of having one intelligence or 
mind, every one has a Jarge number of intelligences. 
5. These different brain systems become interrelated by 
means of innumerable connecting fibers and all are brought 
under a central control. This centrally controlled organiza- 
tion of many minds in a brain is the “personality.” 
The way in which a brain acts at any time is, then, the result of 
what connections it possesses as features of its inborn organization, 
plus what has happened to it in the past and what actions it has 
previously manifested. From hour to hour and day to day it is 
1 Bertrand Russell, Principles of Social Reconstruction.
-P-A-G-E-107
  HOW INTELLIGENCE GROWS 95 
becoming a new thing. From month to month it takes on new 
habits. Everything that is manifested as knowledge, power, self- 
vontrol, habits of thought and action, attitudes and capacities of 
mind, skill and training may be paralleled within by alterations 
which the nerve cells have undergone. If we had perfect knowledge 
of the entire history of a man’s brain, if we could see from second 
to second just what was going on in it, we should find in its actions 
and consequent changes the parallel of his life of thought and ac- 
tion. 
Let no one object that it is incredible that the history of a man 
involving millions of ideas and acts should be paralleled by any 
bodily organ. A human nervous system is estimated to comprise 
over ten thousand millions (10,000,000,000) nerve cells. Each of 
these is itself a complex organ, and is often capable of many con- 
nections. Since it would take ten lifetimes of ten Methuselahs to 
count their connections, it is evident that the brain is complicated 
enough to register the richest and most active human experience.! 
6. Intelligence grows by developing a consciousness of 
the meanings of impressions — that is, their useful relation- 
ship — and by making use of these meanings in providing 
for personal satisfactions. Intelligences are finer and more 
effective tools for mastering environment, for self-protec- 
tion, and for satisfying cravings than are the muscles and 
bones. 
7. The prime work of education is to assist and direct the 
process of mind building. 
8. The most important of the various minds that we 
possess is the social mind. Every one has some sort of a 
social mind, and the kind he has determines his “morality.” 
Each one’s “morality” has been formed largely by the in- 
fluences of the groups to which he has belonged. 
9. The peculiar function of social intelligence is to or- 
ganize social relationships into a harmonious system. In- 
asmuch as relationships are constantly changing, the social

mind must be in a process of constant growth or it becomes 
incapable of understanding the new situation that has 
arisen and of making wise readjustments. 
10. It is necessary, therefore, for teachers to have social 
minds that are not fixed if they are to be helpful to their 
pupils in directing their mind-building activities. 
11. Feeling reactions are as basic in developing minds as 
they are in developing bodies. Thinking is but an extension 
of the lower physical activities. Its purpose is to provide 
satisfactions and, if these are not realized, thinking and 
growth in intelligence slows down or stops altogether. 
12. Success in activity, in the use of the mind as well as 
of the body, is the central factor in satisfaction. From this 
it follows that mental work in school must result successfully 
if it is to be educational. A difficult problem is here put for 
teachers, but it is a problem that can in no way be avoided.

CHAPTER VI 
AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 
Tuus far we have been considering those general facts that 
scientific study has revealed regarding children — those 
characteristics that ally them with animals and those that 
raise them above the animal level. These little human 
animals come knocking at the door of our school. They 
come in groups, but there are reasons hidden away in them 
that, when brought to light, compel us to treat them, not as 
groups, but as individuals. Whether two, twenty, or fifty 
children are related in a social group, the progressive school- 
teacher holds the individual distinctly in her educational 
consciousness. Let us take one of these little ones, Willie 
by name, and note some of the important factors that make 
him a unique educational problem. 
He is the last of his “line” 
Willie is the last of a long line of ancestors. He is, this 
little mite of a boy, a reservoir into which has flowed rivulets 
of human energy that had their springs in the beginnings of 
time thousands or possibly millions of years ago. He is the 
oldest of his race, not the youngest. Biologically he is a 
little farther advanced than his father and mother are. In 
the human army he is marching just ahead of his teacher 
and just behind his baby sister. 
The long process in which myriads of human beings have 
lived and transmitted their life to successive generations has 
been a process that has brought together, in the union of the 
two cells in which Willie began his earthly career, a com- 
bination of qualities different from that ever made before.
-P-A-G-E-110
    98 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
We can see in him his mother’s blue eyes, his father’s hair, 
his grandfather’s quick temper, and his grandmother’s 
sweet disposition; but these are only the large, conspicuous 
indications of the fact that Willie, taken altogether, is a 
bundle of selected ancestral qualities. There are many 
hidden qualities that will appear from time to time to vex us, 
to surprise us, or to cause us to wonder. We shall be in- 
clined to hold Willie responsible for these qualities, forget- 
ting that they, like the color of his eyes and the kink of his 
hair, have been forced upon him by the all-powerful creative 
energy that brought him into being. Before we act harshly 
can we not take time to adjust our biological glasses and 
view Willie at the end of converging ancestral lines?

Individual differences in body structure 
There never was a human being just like Willie, and the 
world will never see his like again. It is well to know where 
to look for the differences that set him apart from all others 
of the human family. If we compare his body structure 
with that of other children, we find differences: 
(1) in the native quality and in the development of his 
muscles; 
(2) in the native quality and in the development of his 
bones;
-P-A-G-E-111
AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 99 
(3) in the native quality and in the development of his 
nerves, brain, and sense organs; 
(4) in the native quality and in the development of 
his digestive, circulatory, glandular, and respiratory 
systems; 
(5) in the native and acquired quality of the blood that 
flows through his body; 
(6) in peculiarities and defects that may deform his body 
or affect its working efficiency. 
So, while it is true that Willie is like all other human beings 
in the general structure of his body, yet there is no part of 
his machinery that is quite like the similar part in another’s 
machinery. And these differences account for individual 
temperaments. They are also factors in the evolution of 
character. 
We note these differences when they are very evident — 
the blind or crossed eyes, the totally deaf ears, the withered 
leg, the swollen glands of the victim of goiter. These gross 
differences attract our sympathetic, considerate attention, 
but we are just learning that the hidden differences are 
deserving of no less attention. They determine in no small 
degree the sort of pupil Willie can and will be in school, and 
the sort of man he can and will become. Or, to put the 
matter in physiological terms, these differences in body 
(machinery) quality, in body development, in perfectness 
of parts, and in completeness of the entire organism are 
conditions that affect the ongoing of vital force; that is, 
“life,” as it strives to express itself in and through the body. 
They condition health, strength, and vigor. They con- 
dition ability to do this or that physical or mental task. 
They condition ambitions and behavior. 
How body differences show themselves 
The differences that have been mentioned show them- 
   
-P-A-G-E-112
100 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
selves in very clearly defined ways. In fact, the hidden 
differences are discovered and located only by their effects 
on mental or physical behavior. 
1. They are discovered in the quickness or alertness with 
which Willie acts as compared with others. Quickness or 
slowness may be traced to general quality of the body 
machinery or to slow development or defect of some part — 
poor ears, eyes, or vocal organs, defective or weak mus- 
cles or bones, poorly developed nerve centers or nerve 
fibers. 
2. Body differences show themselves in the rapidity or 
slowness of growth. Growth at any time is not a steady 
process. Weare quite familiar with the boy of whom we say, 
“He has not grown for almost a year,” and with the girl 
who grows so fast that mother must “‘let down her dresses 
every few weeks.” And there are varieties in this normal 
irregularity that again are accounted for by differences in 
the body mechanism. A conspicuous illustration of this is 
seen in the processes of sex development, some beginning to 
mature at ten or twelve years of age and others not until 
fourteen or fifteen. 
8. Hidden differences in the quality of human bodies are 
seen in the susceptibility or sensitiveness to that with which 
they come in contact. Some are “‘ticklish,” others are not. 
Some note odors or sounds more quickly and accurately than 
others do. Some can endure a stronger light than others 
can. Some will jump at a noise that causes others only to 
turn the head. Some “catch cold” more easily than others 
do. Some are affected by hardships and comforts, by joys 
and sorrows, by responsibilities and influences of all sorts, to 
which others are indifferent. 
4. The limits of development are fixed by the quality of 
children’s body structure. ‘“‘Can a man add one cubit to his 
stature?” Nature’s reply seems to be that the possible
-P-A-G-E-113
  
AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL . 101 
stature of a man is determined by the quality of his body 
cells. How tall Willie may become, how strong, how suc- 
cessful in reading, writing, arithmetic, and in all the other 
activities in which he engages in school, the possible height 
of attainment, is fixed by the qualities gathered together in 
the union of the two cells which were the basis of his being. 
Willie’s ancestors have said the last word as to how great 
Willie may be physically, mentally, spiritually. He and 
society will say the last word as to how completely his actual 
self shall fill out the measure of what he might be. 
5. The native mental abilities and inabilities of the hu- 
man mechanism appear in almost incredible degrees of dif- 
ference in any one particular and in an almost incredible 
number of particulars. It is now a commonplace fact that 
one person learns to spell a word more quickly by using his 
eyes than by using his ears, and that another can fix the 
correct spelling more quickly by writing than by saying. 
These differences arise, of course, from differences in the 
native quality of our seeing, hearing, speaking, and muscu- 
lar machinery. Teachers have long observed that a pupil 
may be strong in mathematics and weak in language, strong 
in geometry and weak in algebra. Professor Thorndike, 
quoting Dr. Courtis writes: 
A child may be specially strong in addition and yet be specially 
weak in subtraction in comparison with other children of his age 
and grade. 
He then proceeds to suggest that 
It even seems that such subtle and intricate tendencies are in- 
herited. 
And he asks: 
How far is such specialization the rule? Is it the case, for ex- 
ample, that a child may have a special gift for spelling certain sorts 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
of words, for drawing faces rather than flowers, for learning ancient 
history rather than modern? 4 
It would seem that we are yet but pioneers in the dis- 
covery of these differences in individuals that originate in 
the qualities of the original life cells. Progressive education 
takes these differences into account. 
The six ages of man 
We are not unfamiliar with Shakespeare’s division of the 
normal span of one’s life: 
And one man in his day plays many parts, 
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, 
Then the Pieaing achtolbos! Frith his hatchel 
‘ ‘1 And then the lover, 
< ‘ > . Then a soldier, 
. - ce . And then the justice, 
= The sixth age shifts 
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon, 
5 a a Last scene of all 
Is second childishness and mere oblivion. 
The seven-scene play that the dramatist sees enacted 
from birth to death by all who live their allotted threescore 
years and ten, Willie will enact also if he lives long enough. 
He is now in the second act, the “‘age”’ of the schoolboy, not, 
however, “whining” if his school is a truly progressive one, 
but hopeful that the satisfactions of successful endeavor of 
yesterday will be his to-day. 
But, if we should ask Willie’s mother how old he is, she 
would not use Shakespeare’s method of calculation. She 
would say, “He is five years old,” meaning, of course, that 
he has lived five years. That is our ordinary way of think- 
ing of a person’s age, and, when we say that one is five, or 
1 Edward L, Thorndike, The Psychology of Arithmetic, p. xvi, 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 103 
ten, or twenty, or sixty years old, we assume that the entire 
person, that he, is so old. The “age certificates” that our 
pupils bring to us are based on that assumption, and in the 
past we have treated Willie and the rest of our pupils as if 
each one was a unit, and that that unit was as “old” as it 
had lived years. 
But neither our pupils nor we, the teachers, are wnits in 
this sense. We are rather an organization of parts, each 
part growing, maturing at a different rate from every other 
part. For example, a person known to the writer has been 
obliged to consult a foot specialist. During the examination 
the specialist remarked, “You are about sixty years old, but 
your feet are only forty years old. I mean that your feet 
have the physical characteristics of a man of forty.” If my 
friend had gone to other specialists, he might have discovered 
that his eyes were fifty years old, that his ears were seventy 
years old, that his heart was thirty, and that his brain was — 
but we will cease summarizing at this point. We have 
taken enough liberties with this real person. We have used 
him to point to the fact that our imaginary Willie comes to 
us not a symmetrically developed boy, but a physically and 
mentally variously aged individual. The most significant 
of these “‘ages” are these. 
1. Chronological age — length of time one has lived, one, 
two, ten, etc., years. 
2. Anatomical age — maturity of bones and muscles. 
For example, a child who has lived ten years may have 
the bones or the muscles (one or both) of an ordinary 
child of eight years of age or of a child of eleven or twelve 
years. 
8. Physiological age — maturity of the vital and repro 
ductive functions. 
Some children at fourteen years of age show no signs of 
sexual development. They are yet but “children,” while 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  104 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
others at the same time-age are fully developed men and 
women. They marry and bear children. 
4, Mental age — maturity of thinking. 
For example, a child of ten years of age (time-age) may 
be able to do the mental tasks which thousands of experi- 
ments have shown that, in general, eleven-year-old children 
can do, or, he may be able to do only the tasks of eight-year- 
old children. Thus, one who has lived for ten years and is 
called ten years old may be mentally but eight years old or 
younger, or he may be eleven years old mentally or older. 
5. Pedagogical or school age — educational standing in 
school. 
Tf a child enters school when he is six years old and at the 
age of eleven or twelve is found in the fifth grade, his educa- 
tional progress has been “normal.” If, however, at this 
time he is found in the fourth or lower grade, he is said to be 
educationally “‘retarded,” or, if he is found in the sixth or 
later grade, he is said to be educationally “accelerated.” 
It should be noted that retardation in school and accelera- 
tion may not indicate mental ability or inability except in 
those particulars in which a school lays emphasis in deter- 
mining promotion. At present our schools are rather poor 
measurers of all but a few mental abilities, and pedagogical 
age is not and perhaps never can be very indicative of mental 
abilities that are useful in practical affairs or in special fields. 
James Whitcomb Riley was kept in the fifth grade until he 
was fifteen years old. Out of school his poetic mind de- 
veloped rapidly and far, but, according to his own state- 
ment, his mathematical mind was always youthful, if not 
childish. Many boys have failed to develop a reading, a 
geography, a history mind and they are pronounced failures | 
by the schools. But in the affairs of life they often become 
leaders in business or politics.

A pupil is rarely able to do school work even one grade above that corresponding to his 
mental age. This boy was fifteen years old. If he had possessed normal intelligence for his 
age, he would have been in first-year high school. He was found in the fourth grade where, 
as tests showed, his mental age (nine years) would place him. This was as high as he was 
able to work successfully, except in reading. (From Mental Hygiene, for July, 1922, “In- 
auguration of a State-Wide Public-School Mental Clinic in Massachusetts,” by Walter E. 
Fernald, M.D., Superintendent Massachusetts School for Feeble-Minded.) 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
106 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
6. Social age — maturity in social relations. 
Willie is a member of various social groups, family, neigh- 
borhood, day school, Sunday school, play groups, ete. With 
what degree of success does he get along in these groups? 
What kind of personalities and with what level of personal 
maturity does he seek to relate himself out of school? These 
are the questions that arise when we think of “social age.” 
No definite measure has been made for determining maturity 
in this particular, but parents and teachers are aware of these 
differences among children. ‘They are as great and as 
evident as the differences in ability in arithmetic, reading, 
spelling, or in physical strength and maturity. 
If the social relations have had as important an influence 
in developing the human mind as students of the mind as- 
sert, it becomes necessary for us tg give predominating 
weight to this fact when we assume the responsibility of 
placing Willie in a grade or when we pronounce judgment 
upon his retardation or promotion. The mental distress of 
children who are separated from their natural social group- 
ing by school policies of grading, placing, and promoting, ap- 
pears now to have a real reason. Their minds, which must 
grow by social relations, if they grow at all, have been torn, 
in part at least, from the soil where they were flourishing. 
The children cannot explain why they are depressed and 
disturbed, any more than a plant, torn from its bed, can 
explain, why it droops and withers. But the effect of the 
violence done the developing mind is distressingly evident. 
Influences producing individual differences 
It is easier to see that a fact is so than it is to discover why 
it isso. And yet it does help us to understand the meaning 
of a fact if we can perceive even very dimly what is back 
of it.- 
_ It must be admitted at the outset that the eauses for
-P-A-G-E-119
  
AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 107 
things human are not very well known. A human being is 
too complicated, the social world and the world of nature 
in which he lives are too complicated for us to be able to 
trace each fact back to its certain origin or origins. So we 
shall use the term influence, rather than cause, because that 
term conveys the idea of indefiniteness. It is important 
that we keep our minds free from the obsession of positive- 
ness when we study human affairs. 
Influence of ancestry 
Was it not Holmes, the literary “autocrat” of nine- 
teenth-century Boston, who once said in effect that it was 
a good thing to be born into a home where ancestral por- 
traits hung on the wall? Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) 
puts the same idea mathematically when he says that one 
half of a child’s equipment is due to parents, one fourth is due 
to grandparents, one eighth is due to great-grandparents, 
and so forth back to the beginnings of time in geometric 
ratio. - 
One’s “family tree,” therefore, is significant even if from 
some of its branches hangs a horsethief. Pride in a gallery 
of family portraits is well founded, even if all the ancestors 
are not remarkable for good looks. ‘‘Marry into a good 
family” is safe advice for young people to follow, and that 
unborn child is wise who selects his parents with an eye to 
their ancestry. 
But when we have thus complacently stated a general 
truth, we have by no means opened up a plain path to under- 
standing Willie. For heredity does not always operate in 
straight lines. It is subject to “variations” and “regres- 
sions.” Willie may be better or worse than his immediate 
family, just as many an historic person has been and also 
some of our own acquaintances are. 
So, while it still remains true that Willie is a bundle of
-P-A-G-E-120
    108 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
inherited qualities, and that his immediate predecessors had 
a great deal of influence in making him what he is and in 
determining what he can become, yet we know so little about 
the way that this influence has worked that his immediate 
family may not explain him at all adequately. The family 
may not be much more for Willie than the background of a 
picture is for the foreground figures, just a situation in which 
he is placed. Willie’s family may be useful to us more as 
cobperating agents in his education than as a means of un- 
derstanding his strengths and weaknesses. 
Influences of sex 
It is difficult to rid ourselves of the long accepted notion 
that men are different from women. A lot of rather inter- 
esting nonsense has been written around the general idea 
that women are “enigmas” which men cannot decipher. 
Of course that is true, and, if it were not for the romantic 
emotion that befogs our thinking, the fact would be com- 
monplace enough and would attract no attention, any more 
than these facts do, namely, that no man understands an- 
other man, that no woman understands another woman, and 
that no human being, man or woman, understands himself. 
It is evident enough, to be sure, that there are physical 
differences and differences in biological function, but scien- 
tific study seems to be dissipating the assumption regarding 
differences in mind and character. 
So far as experiments upon objectively measurable traits have 
been conducted, the specific differences that individuals display 
have comparatively nothing to do with the fact that an individual 
happens to be a man or a woman. These experiments have been 
conducted with boys and girls as young as seven and with men and 
women ranging up to the age of twenty-five. 
There do not seem to be, on the average, significant original 
differences in mental capacity. 
1 Irwin Edman, Human Traits, p. 192.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL " 109 
As this is being written, a woman is presiding over meet- 
ings of ten thousand people,! and, if reports can be relied on, 
she is doing it with strength, poise, and competency. This 
has been considered in the past “a man’s job.” 
The writer has studied schools closely in many communi- 
ties, and the longer he studies them, the less ground he finds 
forthe popular belief that there is any difference in the admin- 
istrative efficiency of men and women or in their influence 
on pupils. Degrees of success and quality of influence seem 
to be due to individual differences in human characteristics 
rather than to sex differences. It is surmised that, if women 
teachers and women school administrators should all adopt 
knickerbockers instead of skirts, our traditional notions of 
sex differences in mental abilities and in character qualities 
would change. Do away with skirts, and the associated 
notions would disappear also — perhaps. 
Whatever weight may be given to the above surmise, at 
least it will be admitted that in late years boys and girls have 
been going together to the same elementary and secondary 
schools and to colleges, pursuing there the same courses, and 
that men and women have been doing more of the world’s 
work together. Vocational purposes are determining the 
kind of education boys and girls shall receive rather than sex 
differences. 
Thus it is possible to affirm with some confidence that 
Willie’s education should not be different from that of his 
twin sister just because he is a boy and she is a girl. 
Influences of race 
* People have strongly established notions on this point also. 
The differences in color of skin, in characteristics of hair, in 
placement of eyes, in body odor, in language, in diet, and in 
personal habits of dress and manner are conspicuous. It is 
1 Northern Baptist Convention, Indianapolis, June, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-122
110 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
probably the general opinion that these are the external in- 
dications of essential human differences. They give support 
to inherited racial antipathies. Teachers, who have had in 
their classes children of different races, speak of the “warm- 
hearted” Italians, of the “heavy” Danes, of the “com- 
mercial” Jews. Striking and typical as these characteris- 
tics are, it is possible that they may not be any more indica- 
tive of basic peculiarities than was the queue which formerly 
the Chinese affected. Many who have given much study 
to this problem are inclined to the judgment that the mental 
differences are superficial, the results of environment and 
education. This view is expressed in the following quota- 
tions: 
There are popular presuppositions as to the inherent differences 
in the mental activity of different races. The Irishman’s wit, the 
negro’s joyousness, the emotionality of the Latin races, the stolid- 
ity of the Chinese, are all supposed to be fundamental. And ina 
sense they are. That is, in the life and culture of these groups, 
such traits may stand out distinctly. But most psychologists and 
anthropologists question seriously whether these traits are to be 
traced to radical differences in racial inheritance. For the most 
part they seem rather to be the result of radical differences in en- 
vironment. Many of the mental similarities of an Indian to In- 
dians and of his differences from Anglo-Saxons disappear, if he 
happens to be adopted and brought up as an Anglo-Saxon.! 
~ One may say in effect, that an individual is differentiated in his 
mental traits by early association with a certain race and by his 
immediate ancestry and family, rather than by the fact of belong- 
ing physically to a certain race.” 
While, therefore, one may not be positive, it may be said 
that there is a fair likelihood that Willie will bring to school 
about the same personality material, whatever be his race. 
The problem of his education will be conditioned by his racial 
background, but the main factors of the problem are the

-P-A-G-E-123
  AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 111 
same whether he comes from Oriental or from Occidental 
stock. 
Geographical influences 
There has been much speculation on the direct influence of the 
physical environment in moulding the mental type of a people, 
but little or nothing can be said to be established. 
There is a fair consensus of opinion to the effect that what we 
may call climate exerts an important influence. In climate the 
two factors recognized as of chief importance are temperature and 
moisture. High temperature combined with moisture certainly 
tends to depress the vital activity of Europeans and to render them 
indolent, indisposed to exertion of any kind. On the other hand, 
high temperature combined with dryness of the atmosphere seems 
to have the effect of rendering men but little disposed to continu- 
ous activity, and yet capable of great efforts; it tends to produce a 
violent spasmodic activity. A cold climate seems to dispose to- 
wards sustained activity and, when combined with much moisture, 
to a certain slowness.! 
It is then probably true that children in the United States 
who live in the lowland regions of the South, and those who 
live in the hot, dry regions of the Southwest, and those who 
live in the cool regions of the North and East are more or 
less affected in temperament by the climatic conditions in 
which they live. Educational policies, if they are to be 
progressive, should take these influences into account. = 
While the permanent effects of climatic influences may be 
doubtful, the temporary effects of weather conditions upon 
our human machinery are very certain and easily noted. 
The wise teacher will modify her program on extremely hot 
days, or at times when the temperature is too low for com- 
fort in her room. She will systematically try to keep tem- 
perature and moisture conditions favorable for the efficient 
working of the human machine.

Influences of social relations 
Our mental heritage is chiefly an equipment which enables us to 
grow mentally. The direction actually taken by mental growth 
depends almost wholly upon social environment and education. 
The fullest organization of mental life is attained only when our 
inherited possibilities are utilized to the utmost through social 
imitation and training.! 
The kind of self we seek to build up depends largely on the type 
of praise and blame and the general character of the moral tradi- 
tion to which we have been exposed.? 
Thus it appears that people with whom we associate, the 
social customs in the midst of which we have been brought 
up, the schools we have attended, give specific bent and qual- 
ity to our personality. What we know, our attitude of mind 
toward matters that affect us, our judgments of what is 
right and wrong, in fact, the sort of mind we have, is deter- 
mined by our social relations. 
A high-school principal in a large city once said that the 
boys who came year after year from a certain elementary 
school were conspicuously ill-mannered. They had little ap- 
preciation of the meaning of “school spirit” and in general 
they were troublesome wherever they happened to be. But 
in the course of time a new principal took charge of this 
elementary school who knew the educational influence of a 
high type of school life. In the course of two years there was 
a marked change in the kind of school and civic mind that 
the graduates of this school carried to the higher school. In 
the new kind of social relations different personalities were| 
fashioned out of the same material. 
Some of the high scholarship students in recent years i 
Harvard University have been young men from the Filipin 
Islands who were wild children of the jungles when the firs'

American teachers went to set up new social influences there. 
These early teachers, so the writer has been told, actually 
chased these little naked offspring of the head-hunters 
through the forest, captured them, and forcibly carried them 
to the schools. Of these some later became honor students 
at a great Anglo-Saxon university. \ 
The following is clipped from a newspaper account of the 
graduation exercises at an old academy in the Connecticut 
River valley: 
Each year the senior class presents, in an open-air theater, a 
Shakespeare play. This year it gave “The Merchant of Venice.” 
The Portia in this performance was named Anna Dohowski. She _ 
is a Polish girl. Her father and mother came to this country from 
Poland, where they were farmers. They are farmers here, raising 
onions in the valley. So the daughter is a second generation from 
old country stock. She is treasurer of the senior class. She 
plans to become a teacher. The class voted her the prettiest, most 
popular, and best student of the class. That is a striking demon- 
stration of Americanization. It is a good picture of what a fine old 
New England town can do. 
Anna’s ancestors had lived such lives that the two living 
cells in which she started her worldly life were healthy, 
vigorous, and of fine quality. She was fashioned by the 
social forces of the New England town and school. But 
we should not lose sight of the fact that to fashion after this 
pattern the New England forces must predominate. To 
have our schools and communities thus formative, they must 
be kept true to type, and this is an increasingly hard task with 
the rising flood of alien influences. 
We have here an educational factor that is too vital to be 
lightly brushed aside by enthusiasts for “democratic public 
schools.” If our boy, Willie, happens to be in an over- 
whelmingly “foreign” district, his parents may wisely give 
serious consideration to the question of sending him to a 
1 Boston Herald, June 17, 1922. 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 \ PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
“democratic” private school where his social contacts shall 
be predominatingly Anglo-Saxon. And there is a national 
need of educational institutions in which the social influences 
of Anglo-Saxon civilization shall be conserved. This will 
be done, not for selfish reasons, but that these institutions 
may serve those who want to acquire the Anglo-Saxon mind, 
as the old Connecticut town and academy served the little 
Polish girl. , 
A child is a riddle 
"Some riddles you can guess. No one has yet been able to 
guess a child, and no one ever will be able to. 
It is not for you to choose what he [the child] shall know, what 
he shall do. It is chosen and ordained, and he only holds the key 
to his own secret. 
So writes the Sage of Concord, and, in lighter vein, the 
President of Antioch College (Ohio) recites this old rhyme 
to point to our common errors in guessing: 
There was a man who had a clock: 
His name was Mister Spears; 
And every day he wound it up, 
For more than forty years. 
And when at last an eight-day clock 
It turned out to be, 
A madder man than Mister Spears 
I never wish to see. 
This rhyme has a growing volume of illustrations when 
applied to child life. Professor Swift cites a number of il- 
lustrations in the first chapter of Mind in the Making, and 
in school records everywhere examples are multiplying of 
those who, having failed in one grade, have succeeded in the 
next when they have been given a trial. Statistics cover- 
ing many surveys show that more than eighty per cent of 
“trial promotions” are successful.
-P-A-G-E-127
   AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 115 
* This striking illustration of our inability to judge a child 
as a whole came to the notice of the writer recently. 
A little girl was so “dull” at her lessons in the elementary 
grades that she was obliged to repeat phases of her work 
and only succeeded in entering high school by way of ex- 
tended private tutoring. Against her parents’ and teach- 
ers’ strong urging, she set her mind on continuing her stud- 
ies. In high school she failed repeatedly, was tutored, and 
succeeded in just getting into college. Here she traveled 
the same hard road. As her health seemed not to suffer 
and as she was determined and worked so hard, her parents 
provided the tutoring and she finally graduated at the foot 
of her class. But in chemistry she did rather remarkable 
work, and, after receiving her diploma, secured a position 
in a commercial laboratory. Here she has shown genius of 
a high order and has made an original contribution to chem- 
ical science. 
No, it is absolutely certain that we cannot know the inte- 
rior possibilities of Willie or of any other human being, and, 
as we more clearly realize this, we, teachers, are giving less 
and less of our thought to guessing the riddle, and more and 
more thought to providing conditions in the midst of which 
Willie will be able, unhampered by unsuitable school poli- 
cies, to “work out his own salvation” by way of successful 
endeavor in work and play. We shall be thoughtful stu- 
dents of our children, experimenters in, ways and means, 
never determining what they can do by past failures, always 
giving them a chance to try. Thus in time Willie may fill to 
the full his ancestral promise. 
Summary of Chapter VI 
1. That the differences in individuals should be considered 
in education is an idea of relatively recent date. It was the 
school policy formerly to lay down a program of studies, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
establish fixed standards of achievement, and to eliminate 
those who did not reach the standard. This is the practice 
still in many schools, secondary and elementary. But pro- 
gressive education gives first place to the individual, con- 
ceiving of him, as we have seen, as a social being. 
2. One way of approach toa study of individualsis through 
a consideration of those influences that make one person 
different from another. While it is quite impossible to come 
to a complete understanding of a pupil by this road, yet we 
certainly are helped to take a less dogmatic attitude toward 
him, if we realize in some measure the variety and the 
strength of the influences by which he has been beset within 
and without, some of which have actually fashioned him 
and fixed his limitations, while others have contributed only 
superficial characteristics to the organism of his personality. 
The former cannot be affected in any way. But the latter 
may be changed for good or for evil by setting other counter- 
influences to work in school and in society. 
8. The influences that have affected one permanently are 
those mysterious qualities in living energy that have oper- 
ated to produce human beings and develop them to higher 
intelligence levels. 
A child acts as a human being rather than as a beast because he 
has inherited a human nervous system. . . . 
He is a musician rather than a business man because he inherits 
the nervous system of a Paderewski. No matter how general the 
trait may be, no matter how minute and unimportant the charac- 
teristic, its presence is dependent upon some quality in the nervous 
system, 
4. Different parts of the physical mechanism in each 
person have different capacities for development and they 
develop at different rates and at different times. The dif- 
ferent parts of the body are therefore said at any given time 
1 Norsworthy and Whitley, The Psychology of Childhood, pp. 21, 22.
-P-A-G-E-129
  AN INDIVIDUAL PUPIL 117 
to have different “ages.” Variations in the “ageing” or 
maturing process of the body parts produce related varia- 
tions in the mental life. 
These facts regarding the differences in individual chil- 
dren, both the differences that are inherent and permanent 
and those that are superficial and changeable, enormously 
complicate the problem of education. 
An individual with a given heredity may become a notorious 
criminal or a power for good according as he is placed in an un- 
favorable or favorable social environment. 
Much of our mental growth in childhood is due to “unconscious 
absorption” of ideas and to imitation of customs from those about 
us. Our mental organization is moulded after the pattern of the 
community in which we live. 
‘5. Progressive education finds no place for assumptions 
of what a child may do because of what he has done. The 
history of “trial promotions” is an objective proof of the 
futility of any such assumptions. Here is a bit of educa- 
tional history on the college level that points also to our 
prevailing folly in this particular. It is fair to say that 
college policies relating to admissions are slowly becoming 
progressive: 
At Leland Stanford University forty-one war veterans were 
admitted by an arrangement with the United States Veterans 
\ Bureau. 
Of these veterans 
5 had left school before finishing their elementary-school 
course (one leaving in the fifth grade); 
86 had been through the elementary schools, but had never 
completed a high-school course. 
‘Thus none of them had had a “preparation” for college. 
While these veterans were at the university 
18 averaged “B—” or higher (honor grade) of. whom two 
were among those who had not completed an elementary- 
school course; 
1 Howard C. Warren, Human Psychology, pp. 398, 399,  
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
18 averaged “C” or higher (passing grade); 
4 averaged ““C —” (conditional grade); 
7 failed. 
This does not indicate, of course, that college preparation 
should be dispensed with. It indicates that the mind as well 
as the body develops out of school as well as in the school; 
that maturity and ambition may overcome the handicap of 
formal preparation for any advanced work. A child may 
return to school from a summer vacation or after a long 
illness with a changed mental attitude toward study and a 
more developed mind. The lesson for us to take to heart is 
that we should stand aside and let the creative energy reveal 
its own power.

CHAPTER VII 
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 
A school is a part of the social organism 
WE have been considering in the preceding chapter how the 
forces that have been operating in the past and how the 
influences of the present focus themselves in each of our 
pupils and make each of them a personality different from 
every other. These individual differences of pupils give 
reasons enough for discarding the idea that schools should be 
alike. If the pupils in one school are different in tempera- 
ment, abilities, and interests from those in another school, 
then it follows that the two schools should be different. 
We will, then, not try to make a rural school after the 
pattern of a city school, neither will we try to make all 
schools in the same town or city conform to a common 
type. 
But there are other reasons besides the differing pupils 
that lead to the judgment that schools should not be 
modeled one after the likeness of another. These reasons lie 
in the differing influences in the midst of which schools are 
situated. Of course, if a school is thought of as a place where 
children are brought together to learn certain generally 
agreed-on ideas, to gain a few skills useful in civilized life, to 
acquire the habit of fitting themselves submissively into 
prescribed modes of conduct, then all schools will be very 
much alike. They will differ only in the degree to which 
they succeed in realizing these aims. We have read about 
such schools in the Orient where the children sit hour after 
hour on the floor in rows, rocking back and forth while they 
repeat vociferously passages from the Koran. The teacher
-P-A-G-E-132
ep ee ee ie 
120 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
sits always in the same traditionally appointed place, his 
traditional long rod at hand with which to rap the heedless 
pate of one who attracts his traditionally sleepy attention. 
We will not believe that American schools have gone to : 
such extremes of sameness unless we take the story of Icha- 
bod Crane seriously. But we are just emerging from a 
period when a school was judged to be good or poor as it did 
or did not conform with mechanical standards of grading, 
quiet, strict discipline, and accurate recitation. The time 
is not far behind us when it was the ambition of a “progres- 
sive” rural school-teacher to make her school as much like a 
city school as she could. And it is possibly true that there 
are yet normal schools in which prospective teachers are 
equipped with sets of uniform methods and devices with the 
  Fig. 5. Two Conceptions or 4 Scuoon 
‘The inner circle represents the local community. The middle circle represents the state and national communities. ‘The outer circle, the world community. ‘The interacting influences, local, state, national, and world, are suggested by the arrows. The school at the left is connected with the world and the locality only by a stream 
of children, who pass back and forth; the teacher also comes from a normal school equally isolated from the wor'd’s influences. The other school is an organ of the community body, vitalized by local, state, 
national, and world influences, and itself exerting influences upon these various communities — directly upon the local and indirectly upon the others. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 121 
conviction that these are essential in the making of a good 
school. It is scarcely possible to imagine notions more out 
of harmony with the conception of education as a process 
of intelligently directed growth. 
No; each school should have a character of its own, de- 
termined by the forces that give character to the pupils and 
also by those that give character to the community. We may 
illustrate this idea in a very simple way by the accompany- 
ing diagram, that shows on the one hand a school that is 
conceived of as a place apart from the community life, and 
on the other hand a school conceived of as one of the vital 
organs of the social body, partaking of its life and, like a 
healthy gland, pouring back into the community streams of 
wholesome influences. 
Let us consider now a few of these community forces that 
should operate in a school, producing qualities that make it 
different from all others, although they have their origin 
outside its walls. Of these forces some are world-wide in 
their influence, others are National and State, and yet 
others are local. 
Geographical influences 
The books that have been written showing how heat and 
cold, moisture and dryness, mountains and valleys, rivers 
and oceans have been influential in the making and unmak- 
ing of races, nations, and civilizations are many and most 
interesting. A very large part of the story of mankind, and, 
as we have noted in the preceding chapter, of individuals, is 
the account of the influences exerted by the surrounding 
geographical conditions. But we seldom stop to think how 
we ourselves are affected by them in our daily routine 
activities. 
We buy rubbers, raincoats, and umbrellas because rain is 
frequent. We change from warm to cool clothing at the
-P-A-G-E-134
  122 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
dictation of the seasons. We take our daily or weekly bath, 
and we are taught to do so as a matter of health, not realiz- 
ing that this is a custom only where water is plentiful. Trav- 
elers in the Far North tell us that the Esquimos never bathe, 
but consider themselves properly “washed” when they 
have swept off their faces with the bare hand. “It is enough 
for the Arab to rub his hands in the sand... . Millions of 
Arabs have probably lived and died without ever taking a 
real bath.”! What a heaven for small boys and girls must 
be the land of perpetual snow and the land of boundless 
sand! And how laughable for a New England “school- 
marm” to go to these regions with “her standards” of bath- 
ing that have been formed, not in fact primarily because of 
a hunger for cleanliness, but because she had grown up in a 
region where water was abundant! Can we not hear her 
say, “Little Esquimo, little Arab, I cannot have you come 
to school unwashed. Be sure to-morrow morning to take 
a plunge in the bathtub. Scrub your neck, ears, and your 
wrists to the elbows with soap and hot water.” And what 
will the poor lady herself do where Nature builds a glacier or 
* a desert and says, “Dear Madam, here is your bathtub. 
Get such cleanliness from it as you can, you shall have 
no other.” 
Not a few teachers have gone from our cool north lands to 
hot tropical regions and have imposed the clothing customs 
of their home upon the natives. Disease and death have 
been the products of such education. Many people who 
migrate to the tropics from countries where a temperate 
climate prevails often learn only by bitter experiences that 
the mental and physical activities that were virtues in the 
old home are vices in the new. 
We are so accustomed to adapting ourselves to the many 
compelling geographical conditions that beset us in the place 
1 Huntington and Cushing, Principles of Human Geography, p. 314. 
 
-P-A-G-E-135
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 128 | 
where we were born that we do not realize that equally com- 
pelling conditions of a different kind prevail elsewhere. We 
label our habits right, righteous, moral, and we label those 
formed in other situations wrong and immoral. It requires 
a devasting cyclone that destroys our own home, a “freeze” 
that ruins our fruit crop and bursts the water pipes in our 
kitchen, or the confusion that “‘daylight-saving” time causes 
when we want to go on a journey, it takes some such awaken- 
ing personal experience to remind us of the insistent con- 
trols of our geographical surroundings. 
Not only do we generally submit to these influences with- 
out a thought that they are controlling us, but most of us 
are unaware of the fact that these same influences have to a 
degree fashioned us. We are what we are because we have 
lived where we do, because we have lived in subjection to 
certain geographical forces rather than to others, just as we 
should be quite different if we had had other parents. As 
in the former instance, we sense this truth when we compare 
an Esquimo with a Hottentot, because the differences in 
their natural situations are extreme and the people with 
primitive ways of living reflect these conditions clearly. 
Thus we can appreciate the master workmanship of our 
Western plains in moulding the character of the cowboy, and 
of the remote mountain regions in fashioning the independ- 
ent mountaineer and the feudist. But it is a more difficult 
matter for a teacher to realize that, of the children who come 
to her school, those that are brought in wagons from remote 
farms are in fact different children from those that come 
from the village, that those who come from the outskirts of 
a city are different from those who come from the congested 
tenement quarters, and that these differences are due to 
natural causes, among which are influences of the geographi- 
cal situation in which they have grown, and not to any per- 
versity on the part of the children or their parents. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
To show how all-pervading these influences are, the ac- 
companying table is reproduced from Principles of Human 
Geography. 
It is one of the signs of a better understanding of educa- 
tion that geographical factors are being taken into account 
in the conduct of schools. Less frequently than formerly 
does a teacher punish or even criticize a pupil for staying at 
home when health would be sacrificed by “‘braving” inclem- 
ent weather. Every wise teacher sees to it that a pupil is 
warmed and that his clothes are dried before he takes up his 
routine school work. The daily program is adjusted to 
weather conditions. “No-school” signals are devised in 
sections of frequent storms. And more far-reaching in their 
effects than these adaptive measures are the modifications 
in curricula and administrative policies that are being made 
better to fit the schools to the peculiar habits and character- 
istics of children in different localities. 
Adult social influences 
In his Principles of Secondary Education, in the chapter 
entitled “Social Principles,” Professor Inglis has analytically 
and clearly stated the effects of social changes on second- 
ary education. He considers them under four headings: 
1, Changes in the home and family life 
2. Changes in community life 
8. Changes in church and religion 
4, Changes in the vocation 
The large effects of these changes on higher education ara 
likewise apparent in the elementary field. They have 
caused one subject of study after another to be added to the 
school program. They have lengthened the school year. 
They have caused progressive reorganization of the school 
system. But these large effects will be passed over to em-

phasize the less conspicuous social influences that are care- 
fully excluded from the socially isolated school, but that in 
the progressive school are recognized and made use of. One 
or two illustrations will point to these influences. 
A few years ago in a small Eastern city the school board 
was petitioned to close the schools on Tuesday and Thursday 
afternoons so that the children might have time for music 
and dancing lessons, for dentists’ appointments, and for 
other interests that parents thought wise, but for which the 
Saturday and other vacation days did not give sufficient 
time. Some teachers were offended by such a petition, and 
still more by the superintendent’s attitude, for, instead of 
asserting the superiority of school claims over all others, he 
proposed to allow the parents to decide the matter by vote. 
When the votes were counted, it was found that a majority 
had been cast for the free afternoons, and some teachers 
faced the alternative of cherishing a feeling that educational 
ideals were being lowered in their community or of recon- 
structing their educational mind on social lines. Such a 
mind accepts the fact that the schools belong to the people 
who support them and send their children to them. 
What shall a teacher, a principal, or a superintendent do 
with the kind of social or community influence indicated in 
the following incident? In a certain city the teachers were 
beginning to “socialize” the school life. The new point of 
view and purpose were discussed quite fully in the local 
parents’ association of one of the schools. Later a petition 
was circulated and generally signed disapproving the “in- 
novations.” The parents insisted that they sent their chil- 
dren to school to learn “‘to sit still,” “to obey,” and “to 
recite their lessons,” and that they did not want any of the 
new plans to appear in the schools their children attended. 
A chapter in the administrative history of former Presi- 
dent Eliot of Harvard indicates the method of “ progressive”
-P-A-G-E-139
  
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 127 
education in situations of a similar nature. It is said that 
at acertain meeting of the faculty a favorable vote was cast 
for a policy that President Eliot had been urging for adop- 
tion for two years. When the President found that the ap- 
proval had been given by a bare majority, he said, in sub- 
stance, “Gentlemen, a majority have voted for this policy. 
‘You know that I have had it very much at heart for two 
years, for I am convinced that the University would be 
greatly benefited by it. According to the rules of the Over- 
seers I am justified in asking their approval of it and I have 
no doubt it would be given, but I believe that we should not 
go ahead until we are more generally agreed that it is wise. 
Let us consider it further among ourselves and discuss it 
again at some future time.” This same wise, progressive, 
and uniquely successful educational leader has repeatedly 
said in public that his entire educational life has been spent 
in advocating and explaining the policies that were set forth 
in his inaugural address when at the age of thirty-five years 
he assumed the duties of leadership at Harvard. Is he not 
revealing to us here his conception of educational progress, 
that it lies not in forcing our own ideas, but in a develop- 
ment of those ideas in the community mind? 
Children’s social influences 
We have thus far been considering the influences affect~ 
ing education that arise from the adult life of the commu- 
nity. The children’s life together out of school, their man- 
ners, language, social customs, should also be taken seriously, 
and school policies should be modified by them. To try to 
graft the standards and characteristics of a highly refined so- 
cial group upon one that is crude or primitive may produce 
a nice school, but not a genuinely educational one. 
A teacher of a class in English in an evening school reports 
that a girl member said to her one evening, “If I use the re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
fined language that we are taught here, the girls in the factory 
where I work will laugh at me. One said the other day that 
I was getting stuck up and that I was putting on airs, and 
she guessed I was getting too fine to work with common 
folks.” Ridicule by one’s associates and exclusion from their 
circle no one can endure. The school should be on its guard 
against using measures or influences that will tend to bring 
these results to pass. Former President Tucker of Dart- 
mouth once wrote that college life is often criticized for its 
low moral standards, but that it would always be true that 
college morality could be raised no higher than the standards 
in the world from which the students came. The sanctions 
of the community have an influence superior to the exhor- 
tations and teachings of the classroom. 
The boy who finds that the strident call of “‘extree” on 
the street corner will sell his papers, while the more refined - 
“extra,” with a soft modulated intonation, brings him smiles 
and ridicule, but no profits, is little likely to carry into his 
community life vocal refinements and the language ap- 
proved by his school-teacher, although he may use them with 
commendable submission in school — to please her. 
Progressive attitude toward social influences 
But some may say, “To be subject in this way to local 
human influences would seem to sacrifice the possibilities of 
the school for usefulness in bettering the quality of life in 
the ccmmunity.” 
The rejoinder to such a view is that there is a middle- 
ground policy that lies between a complete surrender of the 
school to community influences and an attitude of aloof 
superiority. This middle-ground policy is the one that 
governs progressive education. It is illustrated in the ca- 
reer of President Eliot. To pursue it those in charge of 
schools will be aware of the customs and habits of the people
-P-A-G-E-141
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 129° 
and of the children whom they serve, and they will accept 
them as the proper conditions of their service, as the data 
of their problem. The citizens may be unwise at times, 
their standards may be low, but nevertheless the school 
should not be insulated from their influences. 
It is true that such a policy is not an easy one to carry 
out in practice. Neither is the problem of the college girl, 
who wants to improve the quality of life in her rural home, 
an easy one. The respectful and affectionate daughter will 
not wish to hurt the feelings of her parents by discrediting 
their habitual practices and the home comforts and adorn- 
ments that seem to them adequate and pleasing. The 
thoughtful daughter will realize that she can make little 
real headway if she does not involve the parents in a 
wholehearted participation in creating the new home life. 
It will cease to be their home in proportion as she alone 
makes it. 
This same college girl, if by chance she becomes a teacher, 
will do well to consider that her school problem is very like 
that at home. The community into which she goes may be 
uncultured. What shall she do in the lesson on “manners” 
in civics or hygiene? It is the custom in the homes of her 
pupils to carry food to the mouth with a knife or with fingers, 
for father to sit at table in his shirt-sleeves, for boys and 
girls to go barefoot when it is possible. How different 
from these home standards, how far above them should her 
school standards be? 
One who has followed our discussions so far will not be 
greatly put to it to reply to such a question. At once the 
negative answer will come to mind. She will not attempt 
to set up her standards arbitrarily. The affirmative answer 
is that a multiplicity of mental and physical processes 
should be started and carried on in a copartnership of 
teacher and pupils, she being chiefly concerned that the

nerve currents flowing between the community and the 
school are strengthened rather than weakened. 
Industrial influences 
The degree to which the character of local, State, and 
National industries should affect the making of courses of 
study and the maintenance of different types of schools is a 
question of prime importance for local school administrators, 
as it is for those responsible for State and National educa- 
tional policies. In all school surveys it is given a large 
place. That of the Cleveland schools was reported in 
twenty-five books, of which eight have to do with this ques- 
tion of the relation of local education to local industries. 
But here, as in the case of social influences, it is desired to 
call attention to some less conspicuous factors that should 
affect our educational attitude. 
Not long ago the writer was talking with three boys be- 
longing to one of the pre-vocational classes in the city of 
Boston. They had been transferred to this class from the 
regular schools because they had been failing for a long time 
to do the work of the fifth grade, although they were thir- 
teen and fourteen years old. They were full of enthusiasm, 
for they had just come from a teachers’ meeting where they 
had given an account of a visit to some industrial plants in 
the city, a shoe factory, a machine shop, and a furniture 
factory. 
One boy was asked if he would like to become a shoe- 
maker. He replied, “TI like it all right, but I wouldn’t want 
to stand at a machine every day all my life. I would want 
to get to do office work.” The boy who had caught a 
glimpse of the machine-shop life was willing to work for a 
time as a machinist, but his ambition looked toward sales- 
manship, and the other thought that after learning how 
to make furniture he should want to be promoted to the
-P-A-G-E-143
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 181 
designing room. ‘Thus strongly was the hunger to grow 
asserting itself in these boys, classed as on the border-line 
of “mental deficiency,” when the depression of failure and 
of the sense of insufficiency were removed. 
From talking with many boys of this type the writer be- 
lieves that low mentality shares with high this common im- 
pulse to rise in the industrial world, to work on as high a 
level as can be reached. This brings it to pass that in each 
industry and department of industry will be found those 
men and women whose intelligence is equal to the demands 
that are there made on them, but not equal to the demands 
of more exacting tasks. Moreover, the communities made 
up largely of laborers will be those in which the “group 
mind” has relatively low intelligence. Communities of 
skilled mechanics will be characterized by a higher intelli- 
gence, and communities made up predominatingly of clerks 
and salesmen will also have a “group mind” of a higher 
level than these, but it will be on a lower level than that of 
sections where professional men and women or captains of 
industry live. 
This general human tendency to climb to higher levels is 
complicating the school problem, for all pupils strive to take 
the courses that lead to the levels of life where they may 
engage in mental rather than physical work. This accounts 
for the fact — the writer thinks it must be admitted — that 
the general intelligence of pupils in industrial classes and 
schools is lower than it is in commercial schools, and in these 
schools it is lower than it is in college and technical prepar- 
atory schools. 'To guide those pupils who have proved their 
inability to meet the mental demands of the courses they 
and their parents insist on choosing into courses on a lower 
mental level, and to do this before the discouragement of 
failure grips the personality, is taxing the patience and 
wisdom of school administrators and teachers. The in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
182 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
troduction into some elementary schools of courses whose 
purpose is to produce vocational understanding and intel- 
ligent educational and vocational choice is promising. It 
seems probable that these courses will be found in all 
schools, elementary and secondary, in the near future. 
So, then, the prevailing occupations of the people who 
make up a community will exert an influence in the adjust- 
ment of the level of our educational endeavor and expecta- 
tion. Schools in the same town or city will not be governed 
by the same maeteesacy neither will the schools of the same 
state or nation. 
Influence of persons 
Reformers, whether individuals or in groups, “leading” 
citizens with ideas on education, and politicians, yes, even 
politicians, exert an educational influence in the community, 
and they should be drawn into the councils of those in charge 
of the schools. Their participation may not always be 
helpful. Their ideas may frequently be difficult to assimi- 
late into the school system; yet, for all that they should not 
be ignored, for within the apparently unworkable theory or 
the evident self-seeking may lie a fundamental truth that 
has escaped minds that habitually view education from the 
vantage-point of the school. 
Those who accomplish most in education take these forces 
seriously. A State superintendent, who was in no sense a 
“politician” and who never truckled to any one, used to 
make it a part of his business to call upon the citizens of in- 
fluence in all parts of the State, especially those who were 
known to oppose school improvement. If there could not 
be agreement in all cases, there was established a friendly 
personal relationship and a better understanding of points 
of view and purposes. 
A city superintendent of long, varied, and successful ex-
-P-A-G-E-145
AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL 133 
perience admitted that in recent years a large part of the 
time of one of his assistants had been given to meeting the 
various individuals and groups who showed a desire to help 
the schools. By taking a sympathetic interest in the in- 
terests of community leaders they can be led, as they were 
in this instance, in really useful directions. 
Examples of a few of the outstanding contributions to ed- 
ucation that have been made by people not directly con- 
nected with schools will be sufficient to recall many others 
whose influence is recorded in the history of education. 
The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union was insistent 
for two generations upon the teaching of “temperance phys- 
iology.” Some of the details of their program were edu- 
cationally and scientifically unsound, but the generally 
beneficent quality of their influence can scarcely be doubted. 
Horace Mann, the lawyer turned reformer, proved in his 
own case to his State and to the Nation that in fact schools 
are made in the long run, not by those in immediate charge 
of them, but by the influences that arise from the progres- 
sive life of the community. The adoption in New Jersey of 
the law for establishing special schools for the training of ex- 
tremely retarded children was due chiefly to the educational 
interest of one man.!_ The kindergarten owes its beginnings 
in this country to one woman ? and its extension to many 
women in many communities. In every school district 
there are strong personalities whose influence is an educa- 
tional asset. Let not our indifference, our hostility, our ab- 
sorption in our school routine, our notion that these people 
know nothing about education, prevent the schools from 
profiting by it.

National and other community influences 
National aid to industrial education and Americanization 
has stimulated these newer lines of education. However, 
the influences of these and similar policies do not affect 
teachers directly, but there are other kinds of policies that 
do. For instance, while our country was holding an offi- 
cially neutral attitude in the World War the discussion in 
school of war questions was discouraged by many school 
officials and in some places forbidden.!' But, when war was 
officially declared, these same questions became matters of 
daily discussion, and the national influence was still more 
strikingly shown by the fact that the character of these dis- 
cussions, the points of view that were permitted, were de- 
termined by the way the “‘group mind” of the Nation was 
thinking at that time. 
The kind of patriotism that is taught in school is not, and 
should not be, my understanding or your understanding of 
patriotism, but it is the Nation’s understanding of it. At 
present that understanding is found doubtless in the pledge 
so commonly recited in school: 
I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the Republic for which it 
stands — one Nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
By this pledge children all over the country give exclusive 
allegiance to the Nation. World citizenship is deliberately 
kept out of mind. That has been, and it still is, beyond 
question, the prevailing idea of United States patriotism. 
But if and when it is found that the life of the world has out- 
grown this locally centered idea, that it engenders wars and 
hinders the realization of the larger satisfactions that de- 
veloped intelligence now perhaps makes possible, then 
patriotism will become internationalized. It will then be- 
1 In Boston, for example.
-P-A-G-E-147

come the task of the schools to assist school-children in 
building up an international consciousness and an interna- 
tional mind. But it is not for teachers and school adminis- 
trators to make such a vital change according to their indi- 
vidual conception. It is for them to study the National 
mind, to be sensitive to its changing attitude, to be governed 
by its National ideals now and as they may be. 
Much of what we teach in history, much in geography and 
in literature, is determined for us by National tradition and 
present-day National interests. 
If we accept these National influences as our proper edu- 
cational guides, because we are not the owners of the school, 
but trustees for the public, we shall find it natural and 
proper to be sympathetic with the traditions, sensitiveness, 
and even prejudices of the different racial and religious 
groups from which our pupils-come. If one group is ser- 
iously disturbed because the Bible is studied in school as 
literature, why make that compulsory? Can the religiously 
zealous Gentile. teacher justify herself in teaching her reli- 
gious views and dogmas at Christmas-time in a community 
where these teachings are considered blasphemous? It 
would seem not, but rather that in these and innumer- 
able other matters we shall try to be aware of the various 
influences that are active in the community, town, State, 
and Nation, and let them give character to our school. 
Summary of Chapter VIT 
Two extracts from the Cleveland Education Survey in- 
dicate the point of view of this chapter: 
There is an endless, and perhaps world-wide controversy as to 
what constitutes the “essentials” of education; and as to the steps 
to be taken in the teaching of these essentials. The safe plan for 
constructive workers appears to be to avoid personal philosophies and 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  136 ' PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
to read all the essentials of education within the needs and processes of 
the community itself. 
In a city with a population so diversified as is that of Cleveland, 
progress should be made steadily and consciously away from city- 
wide uniformity in courses of study and methods of teaching. 
There should be progressive differentiation of courses to meet the 
widely varying needs of the different sorts of children in different sec- 
tions of the city. 
1. Every progressive school is as different from every other 
as one child is different from every other child. These dif- 
ferences are due to the fact that such a school is fashioned 
by the character, previous training, and mental abilities of 
the pupils who make it up and also by the community in- 
fluences that are active outside its walls. 
2. The word community has a narrow and a broad mean- 
ing. Inthe narrow sense it is the people with whom we live, 
our neighborhood. In the broad sense it is all people who 
affect our lives, whether we are conscious of it or not. In 
this sense the county, the State, the Nation are all commu- 
nity units. If there is a nation or a people anywhere in the 
world with whom we communicate or have dealings directly 
or indirectly, they form a part of our world community. 
All human beings on the earth are becoming a commu- 
nity very rapidly, some accepting their place in the world 
organization willingly and intelligently, others haltingly, 
suspiciously, fearfully. An individual school is affected by 
influences that circulate in and radiate from all of these com- 
munities, unless those in charge insulate it from them. 
8. Geographical influences, both local and world-wide, 
should be taken into account in making a school. But 
natural geographical conditions are being changed by man. 
A tunnel overcomes the barrier of a mountain, a bridge of 
ariver. Railroads, trolleys, and good highways bring dis- 
tant and isolated places near. These works of man thus

“AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL _ 187 
become geographical forces that may radically change the 
nature of an educational problem. 
4, The educational influences that have their origin in 
human beings come, as do geographical influences, from the 
local life, from the surrounding State, from National life, 
and from the world life. These again may be grouped for 
study according as they arise from the adult community, or 
from the child community. A school has a diminishing 
value as it separates itself from these influences, as it sets 
up standards of attainment and of culture, and pursues 
educational policies without regard to them. 
5. It seems to be true that modern industrial specializa- 
tion operates to bring together in occupations and in home- 
making men and women of similar types of mind and of 
similar mental abilities. We have here again a reason for 
adjusting each school to the mental characteristics, of which 
one is mental level, of the community that it serves. 
6. The influences that individuals and groups exert in the 
community should be capitalized for education. A school 
needs these to stimulate and to give balance to its own 
policies and also to multiply its community ties. These 
influences, however, should be directed and usefully inter- 
preted. 
7. The most remote school, as much as the one in cos- 
mopolitan centers, is affected by National ideas and ideals. 
Every teacher, therefore, is constrained to be a student of 
National and world progress so that he may be able to direct 
wisely educational adjustments. Geography, history, civics, 
and literature are the fields in which a teacher may do most 
damage by imposing his individual ideas upon pupils, 
whether his ideas be traditional or radical. 
Both school people and community should remember that since 
schools are to fit people for social conditions, and since these condi- 
tions are continually changing, the work of schools must change. 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Social growth is never complete; it is especially rapid in our gener- 
ation. The work of education in preparing for these ever-new con- 
ditions can likewise never be complete, crystallized, perfected. 
Not only is this generalization true for school systems, 
but it should be a guiding principle in the making of each 
school.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL 
In Part I it was our purpose to explain the method of think- 
ing that should be used by those engaged in the work of ed- 
ucation, and to bring together the fundamental facts that 
should determine its character. We found that educational 
thinking should be the kind the scientist uses and that our 
reasons for doing this or that in school are to be found in the 
discoveries that scientists have made and are making re- 
garding human nature and the life we are living. It is 
now our purpose to apply these reasons more systematically 
to schoolroom practices, to show the sort of school we 
should have if we accepted them as educational principles. 
It may be well, however, to restat 2 them first in condensed 
form. 
Educational principles derived from Part I 
1. Educational thinking should be scientific; that is, an- 
alytic thinking. It is the kind an investigator uses. 
a. It starts with a hypothesis; that is, with an infer- 
ence from observed facts. 
b. It holds this hypothesis only so long as other facts, 
as they are revealed by systematic study, seem to 
strengthen the inference. 
It is the kind of thinking we expect our doctor to do when 
hethinks (infers) that we have appendicitis. We assume that 
he will not begin at once to use his knife, but that he will con- 
tinue to study our symptoms, holding his first inference as a 
probable explanation of our illness, but only a probable one of 
several that are possible. We think that we have aright to
-P-A-G-E-158
  
146 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
assume that he will not resort to extreme measures until all 
other possible inferences are clearly untenable. Even when 
circumstances or facts justify the hypothesis of appendicitis 
and an operation is judged to be advisable, we still expect 
him to keep his mind open to the reception of new facts that 
may be revealed as the operation progresses. Thus we may 
go under the influence of the ether with the assurance that 
the appendix will not be removed if evidences appear to 
point to other causes of our trouble. 
This is the kind of thinking a principal expects his superin- 
tendent to use when he passes judgment on him, especially 
when that judgment is adverse. It is the kind a teacher 
expects her principal to use under similar circumstances. 
It is the kind parents expect teachers will use when judging 
their children. And, as we look back over our own school 
days, do we not remember occasions when a teacher did not 
do this kind of thinking in a matter that concerned ourselves 
or our schoolmates very vitally? Are not these among our 
bitter school memories? 
Thus teachers of the “»vrogressive” sort will be training 
themselves in the art of getting back of appearances to the 
reasons for the appearances. They will ever keep in mind 
that any reasons that they may discover are possibly not the 
real ones. They will not then take an extremely positive 
attitude towards any of their human judgments. They wil’ 
hold these judgments as working hypotheses only. 
2. Scientific thinking applied to the world of nature re- 
veals it as force working through mechanism. This is 
the “one touch of nature that makes the whole world 
kin.” 
' The stars and all the company of worlds and moons that 
make up our solar system, our earth with its multiple forms 
of what we call dead matter — volcanoes, oceans, crystals, 
drops of water, the winds, the clouds, and the soil under our
-P-A-G-E-159
  
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL 147 
feet — all things are visible mechanisms through which 
invisible force is working. 
The bodies of plants and animals are mechanisms through 
which force acts. 
Man’s body is a mechanism through which force acts, and 
so is the society of which he is a part. 
All life operates through a mechanism, and the higher the form 
of life the more complex, sure, and flexible the mechanism.! 
As the working-ways of life force in the human mechanism 
become better understood a valid basis is established for 
inferring its nature. However, science is not concerned with 
the origin of life, neither has it yet been able to discover why 
life is or whither it is tending. 
8. In nature progress is growth. Growth is the building up 
by vital force of ever more complex mechanisms through 
which life expresses itself in ever more refined, or, as we 
say, higher ways. 
Thus the simple machinery of a microscopic egg grows 
into the highly complex mechanism of a full-grown man or 
woman, when once it is activated into life. 
4. The material which is used in the process of growth is 
taken, seized, appropriated from the surroundings in 
which “a life” finds itself. 
What is taken is determined always by the “hungers” 
which are characteristic of life. These “hungers” multiply 
as the body mechanism grows. When “a life” is able to 
satisfy its hungers, it becomes more abounding. When its 
“hungers” are unsatisfied, development is stunted. There 
are physical hungers, mental hungers, and spiritual hungers 
— three rather clearly marked stages of growth. 
Thus it appears that for “a life” to grow to its full stature

Henry Holt & Co., New York.

  148 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
it must live in surroundings in which it may find that which 
tisfies and find it in available form. This is as true of 
man,as it is of plant and mere animal life. 
Hee we have a basic principle of progressive education. 
aa progressive school is one in which every pupil finds avail- 
“able material for growth. oo eee 
5. Growth is determined by the interaction of two tendencies, 
one to expand and the other to control expansion. 
Impelled by the tendency to control expansion, life builds 
up a nervous system through which control is exercised. In 
the nervous system are a great many control centers. Purely 
automatic physical controls are exercised through minor 
centers in the muscles and through the spinal column 
ganglia. As the first or old brain (the cerebellum) was devel- 
oped, it assumed control of the voluntary physical actions, 
directing them more efficiently in the interests of physical 
well-being. When the new brain (the cerebrum) was devel- 
oped, it began to control actions and to direct further 
growth in the interests of a higher personality. 
6. All growth is the result of the self-activity of vital force. 
In this particular, man (our pupils) is like a plant. We 
eannot make it grow, although sometimes we thoughtlessly 
use that term. The plant grows when it finds in the earth 
and in the air the material which it can appropriate and build 
into its mechanism, its roots, stem, leaves, flowers, and seeds. 
The tropical plant will grow in the Northern regions, 
provided we supply warm and moist air, and a soil like that 
in which it thrived in its native land. We cannot make it 
grow in any other way. 
Here we have a second support for progressive education."

7. Personality has developed by way of human relationships. 
“The human mind is a social product.” 
Human society differs from the society of other social 
animals, ants, bees, etc., in this, that with them the social 
machinery, the social order is the same from generation to 
generation. So far as we can discover, they have lived in the 
same way for thousands of years. Human society, however, 
has been constantly changing, and the changes have been 
similar to those that have been going on in individual man, 
namely, in the direction of a more complex organization or 
mechanism through which larger and higher satisfactions 
have been realized. It seems that the mind of man has 
developed its humanity by engaging in the activities of 
society building and rebuilding. These activities compelled 
physical and mental readjustments, and the cultivation of 
“other-mindedness.” Those are the progressive individuals, 
the progressive social and industrial groups, the progressive 
nations, the progressive races that are most skillful in mak- 
ing these readjustments. ( 
Therefore, education must be a socialized process, one ingots ye

determined, foreordained, by the character of the cells in 
whose union it had its beginning. What it does become 
depends upon the surroundings in which it happens to find 
itself. (Accidents and diseases are not here considered.) 
Herein is found the problem of “individual differences” 
that is so profoundly affecting school policies. The possibili- 
ties of a child no one is competent to prophesy. Therefore, 
we find here a compelling reason, if there were no others, for

making school teaching an experimental process, for thinking 
of a school as an educational laboratory. Thus we have the 
support for the fourth corner of progressive education (see

It would seem that Nature might be allowed to work out 
her own purposes in the lives of men, and that schools are un-

and capacities. Ina very large sense it is true that life itself,

relationships with many other human_heings, by. adjust-- 
ments to the customs, institutions, and ideals in the ‘midst of 
which we live. It comes by the influence of our own thoughts 
and fe feelings u upon ourselves, by the reaction of our mental 
attitudes. And it comes also in these later days by the 
reading of books. In the “school of hard knocks” mankind

learns the lessons that affect him most deeply. The cre- 
ative power that is ever remaking our universe will continue 
to the end of time to be the prime fashioner of the mind of 
man and the architect and builder of his ever-changing 
social order. 
Why, then, have schools? 
Without attempting to give a complete answer to this 
question, let us look along three avenues which may lead to 
the answer. 
1, In the human world as in the world of Nature, growth 
is “wild,” instinctive. Every life is subject to many in- 
fluences, some helpful and many harmful. The poison ivies 
and the grapevines climb over the same stone walls. The 
dogberry and the blueberry grow in the same pasture. That 
some vines and fruits are poison, that some influences are 
bad, has to be learned first by bitter, possibly death-bear- 
ing experience. Jn a school the results of the experiences of 
the past may be transmitted. One may learn to distinguish 
the harmful and the helpful, and to reject the one and to 
Ue 2. Mankind has constructed a very complex social 
mechanism. Ina school one may learn about it and thus_ 
can by merely living more or less thoughtlessly in the com- 
munity. 8. A school is an invention of civilized man to bring about 
definite effects in the lives of the new generation. A pro- \ 
1 gressive school differs from others in this, that its purpose is 
i to assist Nature in building up a human body and mind 
capable of participating in a progressively changing social 
organization. This assistance is given by way of providing 
| asituation in which Nature’s ways are directed and speeded 
up. By attending a good school Johnny may fit himself in 
a few years to share in the common life with a degree of effi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 “PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
ciency that by himself he might not in a lifetime be able to 
attain. 
Let us spend a moment more on a consideration of the 
place of a progressive school in Nature’s scheme of education 
and of its codperative function, for it is essential that we rid 
ourselves of the idea, if we have it, that a school is a place 
where a teacher gives an education to pupils who receive it 
at her hands. That has been a commonly accepted concep- 
tion, as is indicated by the not infrequently heard remark 
that John and Mary “received their education” at such and 
such schools. The “lecture system” of teaching was con- 
ceived in this idea. However, a school so conceived is 
destined to work against Nature and in the end its products 
are quite useless. 
But a school in which natural growth is directed and ac- 
celerated has a very different character. It is a life made 
up of the same constituents that make up the life of the 
world. It may be compared with a greenhouse into which a 
farmer brings the soils from the fields and mixes them to meet 
the needs of each different kind of plant that he wishes to 
have grow there. He tries to make sure that each plant 
will find its nourishment in abundance and in available form. 
Tn these soils he places his plants. He regulates the tem- 
perature and moisture according to Nature’s demands. He 
adds this or that food element as the appearance of the plants, 
as they grow, show the need. He protects against killing 
frosts, hail, and destructive insects. But in all he is careful 
to maintain the natural character of his plants so that they 
will thrive when the time comes for transplanting into the 
open garden. 
Such is a progressive school — necessarily artificial in the 
sense that it is man-made — not a copy of the big world’s 
life, but, at its best, a little world in which the pupils live 
so nearly in accordance with Nature’s ways that they sense 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  BASIC PRINCIPLES OF A PROGRESSIVE SCHOOL 153 
no striking differences when they step from one world into 
the other. This school world is more completely theirs. It 
teems with more opportunities and incentives for desirable 
activity of mind and body. It is more variedly satisfying. 
In such a school there will be no school manners, school 
knowledge, school language, school ideas that pupils must 
acquire for school use, but which they find so discredited 
in their larger world that they fain would conceal and dis- 
card them. 
A teacher, a principal, a superintendent cannot then 
“make” a school, or “set one up,” in a community. The 
natural conditions, the people, the children and the teacher, 
principal, and superintendent — all must be taken into the 
reckoning in the organization and developing of a progressive 
school.
-P-A-G-E-166
  CHAPTER IX 
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 
The character of school life is an educating factor 
Prruaprs the greatest scientific thinker in the field of human 
conduct has said, “The life is more than meat and the body 
is more than raiment,” and again, “A man’s life consisteth 
not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” 
Modern scientific investigators in the same field are dis- 
covering confirmations of the Great Teacher’s judgment, a 
judgment that has direct, practical bearing on education. 
By far the most educational factor in a school is its 
“life.” 
The nature, the characteristics of life as it expresses itself 
in individuals and in groups, have been discussed in Part I, 
and their implications for education have been suggested. 
In condensed form these implications have been formulated 
into educational principles in the preceding chapter. The 
questions that we now set ourselves to answer are, How 
should these principles be interpreted? How may they be 
applied in a school? 
We may be sure at the outset that a socialized school can- 
not be evolved, one in which pupils will be increasingly 
educating themselves under the directing influence of a 
teacher, unless the teacher herself has pretty clearly in mind 
the essential difference between a school built upon the idea 
of pupil submission and one built on the idea of pupil 
development. 
Schools of authority and schools of freedom 
By putting the characteristics of these two types of schools
-P-A-G-E-167
  
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 155 
in parallel columns their differences become evident. Note 
that the characteristics are arranged in ascending order. 
Two types of schools 
Type A 
. Occasional modifications by au- 
thority in direction of lessening 
restraints. 
. Enthusiasm in conformity. 
. Conformity to rules made by 
authority, because pupils believe 
they are right. 
. Conformity, because it is seen to 
be the best policy. 
. Conformity, because that is 
what “going to school” means 
— Acquiescence, 
Conformity by force. : 
. Rules made by adults: for the 
orderly conduct of the school and 
the preservation of authority. 
. School conceived as an institu- 
tion into which a child must fit. Type B 
8. Rebuilding the school life con- 
stantly by pupils and teachers to 
meet new conditions. 
7. Initiative by pupils in interpret- 
ing needs and in proposals for 
adjustments, 
6. Growth of intelligent interest in 
school life as a problem. 
5. Intelligent self-control and self- 
direction in all school affairs , 
recognized as the desirable goal. 
4. Higher and fuller satisfactions 
are the pupils’ incentives. 
8. Intelligent study by pupils of 
their school life becomes the 
guide to action. 
@. Rules made by pupils and 
teacher to provide orderly living. 
1. School conceived as a living 
organism, a developing expres- 
sion of social life. 
If we start with the basic conception of a Type A school, 
we find that, however much we loosen restraints, however 
completely the pupils become adjusted to their teacher- 
regulated life, even if they are quite content and enthusiastic 
in always doing as they are told and if changes are made in 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  156 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
the school to provide more completely for their profit, com- 
fort, and happiness, nevertheless the idea at the center of the 
school life is the same. The teacher is master and the pupils 
are subjects. 
In the case of a Type B school, however, the life of each 
pupil and the school life develop together to higher levels 
of self-directed behavior and by the same processes the 
necessary school regulations are determined and applied. 
In all this progressive evolution the natural incentives and 
purposes are given full play, the teacher finding a diminish- 
ing need to use her authority as the pupils learn the lessons 
and sense the satisfactions of self-control and codperative 
activity. 
A school of freedom not made by liberalizing a school 
of authority 
In the story Uncle Tom’s Cabin, the old slave is owned 
in turn by a harsh master, by one who treats him humanely, 
by one who is friendly, and by one who has a real affection 
for him. But the basic quality of his life is the same. 
There is a serious danger in schools of authority that 
children will become habitually submissive. In fact the 
more liberal the school and the happier pupils are made by 
the rewards of submission, the more serious the danger 
becomes. It is possible to have too much obedience. 
But one does not transform a school of authority into a 
school of freedom by merely removing restrictions. Many a 
black man has been even more a slave after his chains were 
removed than he was before. Not a few children have at 
least been happy and contented under the friendly rule of a 
strong “disciplinarian,” while with the teacher who let them 
do pretty much as they pleased they lost both their pleasure 
in school and the very definite profit of living in an orderly 
manner.
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 1857 
Convention and custom are necessary to carrying forward 
impulse to any happy conclusion. 
Not convention [that is, rules] but stupid and rigid convention 
is the foe.? 
It is not release from controls that makes the change from 
one type of school to the other, but a different interpretation 
of controls. The teacher’s controls will be thought of as 
temporary, to be retained only until pupils can substitute 
others of their own making. Thus viewed, the pupils will 
come to think of them as theirs and will become interested 
in proposing and participating in desirable changes. 
Schools of freedom are not new 
A superintendent of a large city school system was riding 
through a remote country section and at a crossroads was 
about to pass a one-room schoolhouse, when he decided to 
stop and goin. He took a back seat and asked the teacher 
to go on with her work as if he were not present. 
After a time the teacher came to him and said, in effect: 
“T suppose you are finding my school very old-fashioned. 
I have no problem-project or socialized work, because I 
don’t know how to doit. Ihave read about these methods, 
but have not been able to go where I could make a study of 
them and I don’t understand just what they mean. So I go 
on living with my children in the old way.” 
The superintendent had seen the teacher’s self-subordina- 
tion, the natural, well-mannered freedom with which pupils 
moved about the room, the friendly discussion of ideas in the 
lessons and of the difficulties that individuals met from time 
totime. He noted now and then a child doing something for 
the common good without being told, adjusting a shade, pick- 
ing up a blackboard eraser, etc. Signs of “life” were evident 
1 John Dewey, Human Nature and Conduct, p. 167. By courtesy of 
Henry Holt & Co., New York.
-P-A-G-E-170
158 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
everywhere, and he said, “If all my teachers who have taken 
courses in problem-project and socialized methods were 
using them as successfully as you are, I should be quite 
satisfied.” 
Not alone in the progressive schools that are described in 
books, from School and Society to The Dalton Laboratory 
Plan, but in hundreds of unknown schoolrooms in country 
and city to-day, and in many schools of the remote past, the 
idea of self-education has given character to the school life. 
The “natural” teacher instinctively adopts the methods that 
promote it. 
Schools of freedom not made by mechanical devices 
After what has been said in the preceding sections, it per- 
haps is unnecessary to call attention to the fact that a school 
of freedom is not made by introducing special forms of 
recitation or any other particular practices. 
Monitors. Whether appointed by teachers or chosen by 
pupils, monitors are representative of the schoolmaster idea. 
They are clothed with the authority of the teacher to exer- 
cise it in her absence, or to register infractions of her rules so 
that punishment may be meted out when she returns. It 
is a spying system, and belongs, in all its forms, to the 
“boss” type of school. 
School-city. Various adaptations of adult government 
organizations have been tried in American schools with the 
purpose of promoting self-government among pupils. Many 
of these experiments have been in operation for a consider- 
able time, but few have survived the enthusiasm of their 
originators. 
Their main educational weakness lies in this, that a 
“school-city” is not a development of the children’s living. 
The organization does not grow out of their felt need for 
such a controlling machine. When they are engaged in
-P-A-G-E-171
  THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 159 
making it go, they are not living their own lives; they are 
playing, imitating, dramatizing adult living. Now, acting 
a part, while it has its educational value and its place in the 
scheme of life, is not an effective way to influence the char- 
acter of the actor. If it were, our great tragedians would all 
be murderers or near-murderers and those who play the 
part of angels would become angelic. To put the matter in 
another way, in trying to bring a school into the form of a 
city, it is as if we tried to have a child wear his father’s suit. 
An attempt is made to refit the suit — trousers are rolled up 
at the bottom, sleeves are pinned up, pieces are cut out here 
and there, tucks and gathers are made in abundance — but 
the suit remains a misfit, no matter what we do to it. Is 
it not true that the government we have is a good one only 
in so far as it has grown out of our felt needs for adjustment 
in community affairs? So in the self-educating school, the 
forms of school government must be those devised by the 
pupils themselves, with the help of the teacher, in view of 
their conscious need for social regulation. It is difficult to 
imagine that, in meeting these felt needs, children would 
ever devise a highly complex organization. 
Pageants and dramatics. Neither are these — in their 
elaborate forms so interestingly, but, for many teachers 
with limited resources, so discouragingly, described in our 
school papers — the most significant signs of a school of 
freedom. Provided a spectacular, elaborate, public exhibi- 
tion is the culmination of progressive interest in a study of 
some phase of history, geography, or literature, it is likely 
to be highly educational for those who participate. It 
completes a circle of interest. Yet, even so, the informal act 
or tableau has possibilities of more general value, for it is 
performed spontaneously as a part of the regular class dis- 
cussion. It is in fact a pictorial presentation of an idea. 
The idea is in the foreground, the setting is subordinate.
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Children as teachers. It is not a new device, that of having 
a pupil act as teacher. It is the “monitor” idea carried a 
little further. Neither is it new to have pupils “criticize” 
one another’s recitations. But a new emphasis is being 
placed on these practices in some quarters. They are being 
“featured” as the necessary characteristics of a socialized 
school. Yet many teachers are finding that they are involved 
in much superficiality when they try to carry these ideas into 
practice. Pupils may waste much time as teachers, and 
their criticisms and comments may be all too often mechani- 
cal and commonplace. Surely this sort of thing is not what 
makes a socialized, that is, a self-educating, school. 
It should not be understood that pupil-teacher and class 
criticism are here discredited. They are highly educational, 
provided they are educational. But if they are not educa- 
tional, they are practices that are both wasteful and harm- 
ful to the school morale. Again it is not the form that brings 
salvation, but a certain substance, and, if the substance fails 
to appear in a given form, there is no excuse for continuing 
to use it. Of course, the better way is to discover why in 
a given instance these practices are but empty forms while 
elsewhere they are vital and promote areal interchange of 
ideas among the members of a class.! 
Thus far we have been pointing out the directions that do 
not lead to a socialized, self-educating school. Let us now 
enter the road that does lead toit. It is the road of progres- 
sive development in understanding the problems of con- 
duct and in solving these problems in the way that Nature 
directs. Progress implies passing from one stage of growth to 
another. We will therefore go to the student of human na- 
ture to see what help he can give us. It may be that he 
has discovered these different stages of our pupils’ mental 
development.

Conduct levels 
The social psychologist tells us: 
We may roughly distinguish four levels of conduct, successive 
stages, each of which must be traversed by every individual before 
he can attain the next higher stage. These are: (1) the stage of 
instinctive behavior modified only by the influence of the pains 
and pleasures that are incidentally experienced in the course of 
instinctive activities; (2) the stage in which the operation of the 
instinctive impulses is modified by the influence of rewards and 
punishments administered more or less systematically by the social 
environment; (3) the stage in which conduct is controlled in the 
main by the anticipation of social praise and blame; (4) the highest 
stage in which conduct is regulated by an ideal of conduct that 
enables a man to act in the way that seems to him right regardless 
of the praise or blame of his immediate environment.! 
We may represent these levels of conduct by a diagram 
which suggests also the growing enrichment of a life as it 
rises through the different stages.

and wrong

  Life in a self-educating school develops from lower to 
higher levels 
The road by which we must travel to arrive at a genuinely

-P-A-G-E-174
  162 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
self-educating school is here opening before us. We must 
take children where we find them, accept them as they are, 
and develop the life of the school with them from that stage 
in the direction of the next, being sure that we do not in- 
troduce the activities, standards, and incentives of a higher 
stage prematurely. It is the children who must “traverse 
each stage before they can attain the next higher.” We have 
seen a little child placed on the top round of a tall ladder. 
He cannot be left alone there, he will fall. But, if he climbs 
short ladders, and then longer ones, in time he will stand at 
the highest level with assurance. 
Sometimes we are discouraged that a class or an individ- 
ual does not reach the level that we are trying to have them 
live on. A young teacher of superior quality was about to 
leave her schoolroom for the last time at the close of the year 
when one of her boys appeared in the doorway. He had 
come to say good-bye. Now this boy had been very trouble- 
some throughout the year, and the teacher said: “I am sur- 
prised that you have come here now. All this year I have 
tried to treat you like a human being and you have acted 
like an animal. I hope you will behave better in your next 
school.” 
We have not enough facts to pass judgment on the justice 
or wisdom of the teacher’s remark, but we have revealed 
enough of the picture of the school life in that teacher’s room 
to see a boy whose “conduct level” was far below that on 
which the teacher was living and doubtless much below the 
level of the rest of the school. By no means at her disposal 
could she, nor any other, lift him to the level of her very 
proper ambition. She had tried hard to do just that and 
had become tired out in the effort. Might it be that she had 
been too much engrossed with her ideals to analyze the boy 
as she might have done? Was it possible that she did not © 
experiment enough with the influences that were effective on 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 163 
the low level where he was? It may well be true that, be- 
cause of limited intelligence, or of strong outside influences, 
this particular boy was permanently fixed on the lowest 
conduct level. If this were the case, his presence in any 
school would make it impossible for the pupils to raise their 
school life to’as high a level as they could without him. 
This condition a teacher should accept as one of the factors 
in her problem. We shall consider this further in the next 
chapter, on “Discipline.” Werte thro 
The progressive teacher analyzes her situation 
A teacher finds herself facing a new group of children on 
the first day of the new year. She is ambitious to have a 
school in which the life of the children shall be free to de- 
velop. She understands that there can be no development 
that is not aggressive and self-assertive, but that expansion 
must be balanced by controls. She knows that her pupils 
are growing personalities, and she realizes that her task is 
not to mould but to influence the direction of their growth 
toward the next higher level, that the “fashioning” must 
be of their own making. 
Her first work then will be to analyze the situation as she 
finds it. She will ask herself some questions: 
1. Are these children accustomed to a school of Type A 
in which the teacher rules, and they obey? Are they 
habituated to submission, or to expecting that it will 
be demanded? 
2. What sort of home life do they have — are they pam- 
pered, are they allowed to shift for themselves, are they 
dealt with honestly, etc.? 
8. Who are the leaders, and what kind of leaders are 
they? 
4, On which of the four “conduct levels” is the school as 
a whole and are the leaders individually now?  
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
- Questions like these will lead to a discovery of some of 
the factors in the teacher’s problem which will help her 
determine when, where, and how to begin the processes of 
self-education. 
Leading the school into satisfying activities 
With the best intentions we open our school year with a 
talk in which we explain the sort of school we want to have. 
In doing this we yield to a natural tendency. But talk of 
this kind to children seldom carries a school far in the desired 
direction. We make the same mistake here that we do when 
we say to a child, “You are not thinking. Think hard,” or, 
“Be good.” But we do not say to him, “Grow,” or, “Be 
strong,” because we. know that the only way a child can 
grow physically is to engage in an active, satisfying physical 
life, assimilating into his body tissues every moment the 
food that is necessary for his nourishment. So we may be 
quite sure that our pupils will “think,” not by being told 
to think, but by having something mentally satisfying to 
think about. Ina similar way they become “good” by 
finding satisfaction in what we call good action. 
Tf, then, we find that our school is on the lowest “conduct 
level,” we will try to find some way to have the pupils taste 
a satisfaction on the next higher level, although they may 
not be able or perhaps they may not care, to eat a full meal 
on that level. To illustrate. 
A seventh-grade teacher undertook to “socialize” her 
history recitations. She explained the idea to the pupils and 
they seemed to be enthusiastic to begin. She appointed 
members of the class in turn to be teacher. In a short time 
confusion developed, and then disorder. Several causes were 
evident, among them these: 
a. Some of the pupil-teachers were incompetent, lacking 
ability and preparation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 165 
b. The class did not know how to discuss ideas, for all 
their previous training had been in reciting. Naturally 
their comments degenerated into criticisms of mechan- 
ical features of the recitation. Variety here was 
soon exhausted. They began to be indifferent and the 
teacher began to make rules that would induce them 
to “say something.” Finally she resorted to penal- 
ties for non-participation, and the end was in sight. 
ec. Throughout this descent toward failure three boys 
were prominent promoters of disorder. They made 
remarks intended to cause laughter. They were lead- 
ers out of school, and their attitude was accepted by 
others as the proper one. Furthermore, they had 
been troublesome in all their previous schools. The 
teacher kept them after school. She “reasoned” with 
them. She sent them to the principal repeatedly. 
Nothing but punishments and the fear of it seemed to 
influence these boys. 
Now the teacher began a quiet, unobserved study of her 
school, and particularly of these boys. She analyzed their 
leadership to discover the personal qualities that produced 
it, and the kind of social rewards that gave them satisfaction. 
She at last was ready to try an experiment, a class organiza- 
tion in which these boys would find a place of leadership. 
We need not go into the details of the experiment. Dif- 
ficulties were met with, but by degrees through this school 
society the teacher found the way to engage her pupils in 
genuine self-educating activities, and these boys found their 
hungers for power, influence, and popular favor satisfied in 
constructive, rather than in destructive, leadership. 
The method of experiment 
Professor Tyler writes in one of his books, “Life always 
has been, always must be an experiment.” ‘As we go about 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
our work of providing the conditions favorable for the self- 
education of our pupils, we shall be wise if we recall these 
words to mind frequently. In choosing a hat, or a pair of 
shoes, we naturally adopt an experimental attitude. We try 
this shape, and that size, and the other color, until we find 
the one what satisfies us. But to experiment in the conduct 
of our school is another matter. If one plan does not work, 
we become discouraged and resort to the ways of authority. 
The experiments we try should grow out of the immediate 
situation. Plans of last year will not work out equally well 
this year. The high level of socialization that one class 
reaches is far above what another can attain. New pupils 
bring with them different abilities, temperaments, habits, 
and backgrounds. If we will look at it so, our work is a 
game, with all the fascination of new combinations on the 
pupils’ side; and, upon ours, knowledge of the game, versa- 
tility in planning, and skill in executing. 
All of these qualities that are called into play we can cul- 
tivate. We can increase our knowledge of the game by ex- 
tending our study of the human mind and of human society. 
We become versatile in planning by cultivating the habit of 
analyzing our pupils and their present school life to discover 
the motives, the attitudes, the abilities that are there and by 
bringing these into our schemes in a variety of ways. By 
open-minded and courageous trial we shall become skillful. 
Better fail in an experiment than lapse into the easy routine 
of a mere program-follower. A failure, carefully studied, 
has been the beginning of large successes in the experience 
of many teachers. It is the failures of our pupils that 
point most unerringly to their special needs for help. 
Developing intelligence in conduct 
What is Nature’s way of making us wise in our relations 
with others? Is it not by inducing us to think about what
-P-A-G-E-179
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 167 
happens when we act in a particular situation? And is it 
not true that the results of our action is what makes us think? 
If what I do brings pain, loss, inconvenience to myself or 
others, I think before I act in the same way again. 
To form the habit of asking how we should be willing to be 
treated in a similar case is to gain an ally for impartial and sincere 
deliberation and judgment. 
What. we need are those habits, dispositions, which lead to | 
\impartial and consistent foresight of consequences. Then our/ 
\judgments are reasonable; we are then reasonable creatures.* 
Nature does not lecture, she does not tell us how wicked 
we are, and that we ought to be ashamed of ourselves. She 
puts before us the results of what we do, and in turn these 
results stimulate us to picture other results that would have 
followed other courses of action. Thus our impulsive acts 
come to have meaning. In the light of these meanings we 
choose. Engaging in acts in line with our choice, we will. 
By degrees we rise to higher mental levels, and make our 
choices and govern our lives by a finer judgment regarding 
the values that lie before us. 
The will is not a simple impulse toward movement, but the 
intelligent direction of movement. .. . It is action that counts.? 
But in early childhood we can hardly be said to choose. 
Our impulses fly off to meet the chance attraction, and we 
find ourselves involved in what our elders call misbehavior. 
Why did we do it? For the life of us we don’t know. We 
are lectured and reasoned with, but we don’t understand 
what it is all about, however docile we may be, however 
much we may nod our head in acquiescence, and promise 
not to do it again.

After a long lecture of this kind to his little boy, whom 
the father wished to have understand how “naughty” he had 
been, the little fellow found his mother, and with sad eyes 
looked into her face and said, “What did father mean?” 
Not all children react in the same way; some are sullen, some 
go off and play light-heartedly; but we may be quite sure 
that our moral talk finds small place for lodgment in a mind 
morally unformed. 
Psychologists are discovering for us that we are constantly 
in danger of assuming a level of mental development in our 
children that they have not reached. We make our mis- 
judgments with the older children as frequently as we do 
with the very young, possibly more often. Mental levels 
are not determined by years of life. But we pour out upon 
young and old alike without discrimination our mature and 
conventional views, our wise saws. It is so much easier than 
to provide means and open up ways for the children to find 
out for themselves how they ought to live by choosing the 
consequences they prefer in the immediate present. The 
easy way, too, gives us a comforting feeling that we have 
done our duty. But, after all, so much of our moralizing 
is idealistic and therefore far-fetched, if not actually ir- 
rational. 
! In the school life impulses should find direction not 
suppression 
We may say then that directly and indirectly the instincts are 
the prime movers of all human activity. ... 
Take away these instinctive dispositions with their powerful 
impulses and the organism would become incapable of activity of 
any kind.! 
When a child creates disorder in school, when he is mis- 
chievous, it is very difficult to keep in mind that he is not

really doing these things just to be “bad,” or for the sake of 
doing “wrong.” ‘The truth of the matter, however, seems 
to be that he has at this moment given way to impulse, just 
as we do when we “scold” him. We adults call those 
impulsive actions “right” that fit into the conventions, 
customs, conveniences of ourselves or others. Children 
should learn, of course, to adapt themselves to these, but for 
them it is a long process of learning what and how, and we 
shall have little success in helping them if we label their 
troublesome conduct “bad.” We may be obliged at times 
to exert our authority and even physical strength to restore 
an orderly school life, but this will be but an incident in a 
policy of guiding impulses into useful, active channels. 
The rewards of right action 
If the students of human nature are correct, we should all 
be bad provided badness on the whole brought us more 
pleasure than pain. The one who robs and kills, who cheats 
and lies, who loafs away his time as a hobo does so because 
he believes that along these roads he finds the things he 
wants. When we eat candy, we do not choose the tasteless 
or bitter kinds. We buy the hats that are becoming and 
the shoes that are comfortable, or, if we buy uncomfortable 
shoes, it is because the more intense satisfaction of a dainty- 
looking foot has had the stronger drawing power. This is 
what the writer means when he says: 
It is only when people find pleasure in the right actions, that 
they can be depended upon to perform them. And it is by their 
early and habitual performance that they will become pleasant.t 
Now happiness is not in itself a proof of righteousness. 
The tramp by the wayside may be quite happy as he eats 
the pie stolen from some thrifty housewife’s kitchen. 
1 Irwin Edman, Human Traits, p. 458.
-P-A-G-E-182
170 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Schools in which there is little chance for personal growth, 
because they are built on the idea of submission, may yet 
be so liberally governed that the pupils are happy. There 
seems to be a sort of competition among the rewards of our 
actions, and it is for us to see to it that our pupils find the 
rewards of “right action” sweeter than those of “wrong 
action,” that they get the taste early, and that by much 
tasting they come to have a preference for them. 
The naturalness of the desire, even longing, of human be- 
ings for the higher pleasures, the nobler rewards of life, 
provided this tendency has not been destroyed by habitual 
indulgence in the lower, is interestingly expressed in a recent 
story of the Kentucky mountains.! One of the primitive 
feudists is made to say: 
Hit beats anything ever was heared of. You see, the young 
folks in this country never seed no pleasure before, less’n it was 
mean pleasure. We never knowed there was right pleasure. 
While it is true that lecturing, talking to children about 
their behavior, does not give them much additional under- 
standing of it, to discuss with them particular acts may help 
them to see these acts in the light of their consequences. 
Through these conferrings together opportunities may be 
created for trying different ways of meeting specific situa- 
tions to see which yields the best results in general advantage. 
Organizing plays on the school-ground, passing in and out 
of the schoolhouse and building, etc., will become problems 
which in the solving will give understanding and the “‘feel” 
of right action. In other words, the problems of the school 
life should be shared with the pupils. Thus practice of and 
thinking about what constitutes happy living together will 
be combined. 
But we may also find problems of conduct in our reading 
1° The Quare Women,” Ailantic Monthly, October, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-183
THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 171 
and study of geography, history, civics, literature, and cur- 
rent events. These will be more remote and therefore less 
effective for developing conduct intelligence than are the 
personal problems that arise in the pupils’ own school life, 
but they extend the mental horizon and they may be so dis- 
cussed as to throw light on those that are more immediate. 
The influence of school customs 
Under the influence of the teacher her school develops 
customs that determine the quality of the school life. She 
may be quite unaware that this is so, and she may have no 
particular plan, yet, by just living together, certain ways of 
doing things become established, certain mental attitudes, 
rules and regulations. These are the customs, “‘folkways,” 
behavior habits of the school. To go contrary to them is to 
do “wrong,” not only in the eyes of the teacher, but in the 
estimation of the pupils. Their school morality consists in 
conforming to these social forms and standards. Dr. Dewey 
writes: “For practical purposes morals mean customs, folk- 
ways, established collective habits.” 3 
The influence of these established school customs is very 
direct. In the first place, there comes to be an expectancy 
and a mental adjustment on the part of children before they 
actually become members in a school. It is not uncommon 
for one to say to another, “‘ You ’re going to Miss B’s room. 
Well, you’ll have to mind. She won’t take any nonsense.” 
Or, “If you go to Miss C’s room, you can do a lot of things 
you can’t in Miss A’s room.” Or, “Miss D is easy. You 
can do about as you please.” 
When, in the second place, one becomes a member of a 
school, its customs, its ways grip him and begin to fashion 
him. Teachers of experience know how out-of-place a child 
from a “free” kindergarten is during the first weeks in a

-P-A-G-E-184
  172 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
“regulated” first grade. On the other hand, the boy or 
girl who has attended for long a “regulated” school does not 
know how to act in a “‘self-educating” environment. It is 
the story in another edition of the cowboy blustering in the 
city hotel corridor because he feels the misadjustment of 
his ways to those in which he finds himself, and of the city 
chap who is derided as a “tenderfoot” in the cowboy’s 
country. The experience of the young man from our Western 
plains at a fashionable banquet in London during the war is 
recalled. He was seated next to a duchess resplendent in 
native charm and jewels. At a loss for ideas and quite 
abashed, he sat silent a long time. But at last, driven by 
a feeling that he ought to say something, he remarked in 
a voice that carried to all parts of the room, “I don’t 
know what to say to a duchess, but you sure do look good 
to me.” 
To illustrate the subtle influences of our surroundings 
upon our higher life, C. Hanford Henderson relates the fol- 
lowing:! 
You remember, perhaps, that fine incident of the cloisonné 
maker who brought his wares to one of the earlier Paris exposi- 
tions, and sold them to such excellent advantage that he found 
himself quite unexpectedly in possession of fifty thousand dollars. 
He was warmly congratulated, and it was suggested to him that he 
could now enlarge his factory, and with a market already eager, he 
could soon make a fortune. But his reply was something better 
than that. It was that his ware would become inferior if he 
turned it out in such large quantity, that he would spend the 
money, rather, in creating a beautiful garden around his work- 
shop, and that his work-people, in the midst of this encircling 
beauty, would then produce still more beautiful ware. 
We have here a reason for beautiful school buildings and 
grounds, but an even more evident reason for having the 
character of the school life of a sort that will promote crea- 
1 Education and the Larger Life.
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE LIFE OF THE SCHOOL 173 
tive living. The school customs, its ways, and habits make 
this character. The most impelling influence for self-disci- 
pline among our pupils is an orderly school. It is charged 
with electric organizing currents that make self-control easy 
and popular. The school sentiment favors order and dis- 
countenances disorder. School sentiment is the junior 
edition of public sentiment, and public sentiment is the 
strongest force in human society. 
But, while the kind of customs that prevail in a school are 
formative, the attitude that we and our pupils have toward 
their “folkways” makes all the difference in the world in the 
quality of education that is derived from them. This will 
come to mind at once because of our previous discussion 
regarding children’s participation in remaking their school 
ways. The following statement from a book previously 
cited gives an added emphasis to the self-educating use that 
we should make of customs, rules, and regulations: 
But reflective acquiescence in @ custom differs from mechanical 
conformity. It transforms a custom from a blind mechanism into a 
consciously chosen instrument for achieving good. 
School leaders 
As we are engaged with our pupils in developing the life 
/ of the school, conduct leaders will make themselves felt. 
Provided the conditions are favorable, they will rise to 
prominence as the leaders in thought, dramatics, memory 
reciting do when these activities are being carried on. Ina 
progressive school all the various kinds of exceptional ability 
will find opportunities and incentives for use and they will 
receive their natural rewards in school approval, teacher ap- 
proval, and appointment to positions of responsibility and 
trust where leadership can be exercised. 
In a school where submission is the ideal, as in an auto- 
1 Irwin Edman, Human Traits, pp. 421, 422.
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
cratically governed community, there is no place for leaders 
of action. They are suppressed and discredited. If a 
teacher of such a school needs a leader to head the “files,” she 
is apt to say, “I want the boy who has been most attentive 
to his work this morning, whom I have n’t had to correct for 
behavior,” and she picks Fauntleroy Smith, the submissive, 
gentle boy of books, as a reward for not giving her any 
trouble. Naturally enough, human nature being what it is, 
Sam Hawkins and Bill Madden and Jimmy Muldoon feel 
the urge of leadership mounting higher and higher as they 
march behind the docile Fauntleroy. They would put 
“pep” and “go” into the performance. All this is inar- 
ticulate, but it’s in their “bones,” and so when a good chance 
comes they give the line a push and incur disgrace if they 
are found out. We are reminded here of Byron’s explanation 
of Jack Bunting’s profanity. 
He knew not what to say, and so, he swore. 
Now a self-educating school will teem with opportunities 
forall kinds of leadership, and it is the privilege of the teacher 
to direct the school life in such a way that all those with 
leadership abilities find the places where their particular 
kind of strength is called into play, the active, practical- 
minded in leading games, marches, etc., the artistic in art 
exhibitions, the scholarly where scholarship is needed. 
And, in so far as it is possible, the leaders should be given 
their responsibility by their schoolmates, rather than by 
the teacher. This policy may give the teacher anxious mo- 
ments sometimes, for children are no more free from bias, 
personal preference, and jealousy in their choices than their 
elders are. But the teacher has a unique position of influ- 
ence. Through the discussions about conduct problems re- 
ferred to previously, pupils may be led to subordinate these 
personal considerations and determine their choice by esti-
-P-A-G-E-187

mates of abilities as related to the demands involved in par- 
ticular positions. 
As many teachers and principals can testify, what seems 
to be a poor choice by pupils has turned out at times to be 
better than the authorities would have made. The trouble- 
some boy of action has been sobered and his undisciplined 
energies have been brought into control by the responsibili- 
ties of official leadership. He has become an ally in direct- 
ing the school life in wholesome directions. One can well 
afford to have courage and patience, to take some risks, to 
accept some anxiety in carrying out a policy of self-education 
through the school’s life. Its rewards are ample, although 
one cannot avoid some disappointments. It is reported that 
Dr. Arnold, the famous principal of Rugby, once remarked: 
“T always trust my boys, but I expect them to disappoint 
me.” And perhaps the most popular dean that ever pre- 
sided over the conduct of students at the American Cam- 
bridge has written: “Harvard students demand to be treated 
as gentlemen, and to be trusted, although they do not always 
act like gentlemen and are not always trustworthy.” 
Evidences of a self-educating school 
It is not possible to lay down a system of specific rules for 
direction in creating a progressive school. For a school of 
authority this can be done. The teacher can be told where 
she should stand and sit in order to exercise control most 
effectively; how her children should do this and that; the 
exact way to have supplies and books distributed; the num- 
ber of minutes she should keep after school for whispering 
and the number for pulling a girl’s hair — a few minutes 
more if it is red hair, on the theory that the greater the 
temptation, the greater the sin in yielding to it, and there- 
fore the more severe the punishment, if exact justice is to be 
meted out. Lesson plans in great detail can be supplied for 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  176 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
teaching Asia and Timbuctoo and for “developing” number. 
This can be done for developing subjects, but, if the develop- 
ing is to be of growing human beings, these factory-made 
methods will not work. This will come only by daily ex- 
perimenting with policies and practices whose purpose is 
the interpretation of the idea of self-education in a living 
social organism. 
And no one is justified in judging the merits of a particular 
practice abstractly. It is good in proportion as it is pro- 
ducing good results. What might not be highly approved, 
if read in a book, may be producing in a given situation the 
“fruits of righteousness.” 
“By their fruits ye shall know them” is the only reliable 
guide in judging a school, as it is in judging the character of 
aperson. These fruits are so many in variety that it would 
be as impossible to describe them all as it would be to de- 
scribe all the different varieties in shape, color, size, moisture 
content, flavor of the fruit in an apple orchard. New varia- 
tions are appearing daily in all progressive schools. 
Yet there are a few fundamental qualities that are com- 
mon to all schools of freedom. These have been suggested 
in the scale of values of the Type B schools on a previous 
page in this chapter. They are restated here. The ap- 
pearance in any small degree of any one of these qualities is 
a proof that the life of the school is developing in the right 
direction. 
1. When a pupil moves about the room he 
a. does it for a working purpose; 
b. shows self-control; 
ce. shows thoughtfulness in unexpected situations, such as 
meeting another, finding some one using the book he was 
after, passing the teacher or a class at recitation, etc. 
2. An orderly school — not the mechanical order of ninepins, 
but of an efficient workshop. 
8. A quiet school — not the quiet of a graveyard, but of cen-

tented absorption in one’s own or one’s group interests, with 
care to avoid distracting others. 
4. Opportunities for mischief — if there are no such oppor- 
tunities there is no freedom of choice and of self-control, 
that is, no morality. The proof that there are opportunities 
is an occasional disorder. 
. Public sentiment of the school in general discouraging wrong- 
doers. 
. Genuine discussions of school-life problems, but not forced. 
. Growing interest in these discussions. 
. Growing tendency of pupils to raise questions and propose 
ways of bettering school policies. 
. Evidences of satisfaction as pupils rise to higher levels of 
self-control and self-direction, and as they modify the or- 
ganization of their school to give larger play to their interests. 
10. An “atmosphere” of happiness in successful work and play. Onn o © 
The following ideas of some who have been advocates and 
interpreters of progressive education will be found helpful 
guides in judging whether our school is in fact one of au- 
thority or one of freedom: 
True education is what remains behind, when all that was 
learned at school has been forgotten. Emerson. 
The manner in which students react to favorable or unfavorable 
environment is of far more importance as an indication of the 
general trend of activities than is an analysis of intellectual proc- 
esses. Stewart Paton. 
When a child begins to respect the work of others; when he waits 
patiently for the object he desires instead of snatching it from the 
hand of others; when he can walk about without knocking against 
his companions, without stamping on their feet, without overturn- 
ing the table — then he is organizing his powers of volition, and 
bringing impulses and inhibitions into equilibrium. Madame 
Montessori. 
If the habit has not been formed of associating successful achieve- 
ment with effort, the foundations of an education have not been 
laid. Stewart Paton. 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention 
over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character and 
will . . . and education which should improve this faculty would be 
the education par excellence. William James. 
Life is perpetuated only by renewal. If conditions do not permit 
renewals to take place continuously, it will take place explosively. 
John Dewey. 
School life and citizenship 
The life of the school should develop the qualities that 
make a young citizen a desirable and useful member of a 
democracy. Two lists of such qualities are here given. The 
first is the result of long study by a mature student of de- 
mocracies, the second the result of a study by experienced 
school people. 
Characteristics of a Young Citizen! 
1. A lover of freedom. 
The exercise of one’s own’ freedom must 
not infringe the freedom of another. 
. Faith in progress. 
. A disciple of order. 
. The spirit of reverence. 
. Belief in equality. orm oO 2

20. Is courteous and considerate. 
21. Is codperative. 
22. Is broadminded. 
23. Is loyal. 
24. Has a fine sense of appreciation and seeks to express it. 
Summary of Chapter 1X 
1. The character of a school has a strong influence for 
developing the character of its members. 
2. In schools that are based on the idea of authority and 
submission, the prevailing attitude of pupils will be sub- 
missive. Such a school can contribute little to the training 
of citizens for a democratic form of life, no matter how lib- 
eral the authority is, how kindly its spirit, or how happy the 
children may be. 
8. To create a self-educating school the teacher must 
start with a clear conception of it as a social organism in 
which the God-given impulses of life are free to act, but 
under direction. 
4. Direction will be given progressively by the growing 
preference of the pupils for the satisfactions of an orderly, 
codperative life as they experience them in a school where 
they engage with the teacher in making and remaking the 
conditions favorable for their mutual profit. 
5. Such schools are not new, but they have been few in the
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
past. They are becoming the general type because our 
times call for them. 
6. A self-educating school develops. It is not made by 
imposing set forms or by introducing any particular prac- 
tices. It starts with the situation as it is, and evolves in the 
direction of the next higher level of self-directed activity. 
7. A progressive teacher determines her course of proced- 
ure after an analysis of her pupils and of the situation as 
she finds it. She proceeds experimentally. 
8. Pupils develop in their ability to direct their own affairs 
intelligently primarily by weighing the alternative results of 
their own action, and secondarily by discussing the conduct 
problems that appear in the “culture” subjects that they 
study. 
9. School customs and school leaders are influential fac- 
tors in the life of the school. 
10. The reality of a progressive school is not proved by 
the presence of certain so-called socialized and problem- 
project forms, but by evidences of self-control, of self- 
commitment to interests that are profitable for self and for 
the class or school, of an attitude and habit of other-minded- 
ness. 
11. In the life of such a school develop the qualities that 
make for democratic citizenship. 
The government of a state with democratic institutions is the will 
of the people taking shape. 
It is hard to say what liberty is because the essence of it is the 
subjugation of personal inclinations. 
Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control. These three alone 
lead life to sovereign power.?

CHAPTER X 
DISCIPLINE 
Discipline as coercion and as adjustment 
Like all words that have been used for a long time, “dis- 
cipline” has come to have a variety of different meanings. 
We speak of the “discipline” of the mind, and in the Inter- 
national Dictionary we find these interesting quotations from 
the writings of “classical” authors illustrating accepted 
usage in the past. 
“Wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity.” 
Bacon. 
“Obey the rules and discipline of art.” Dryden. 
“The most perfect, who have their passions in the best dis- 
cipline, and yet obliged to be constantly on their guard.” Rogers. 
And then follows the traditional school definition, “ training 
through suffering.” 
“The discipline of the strap.” Addison. 
This last is the sense in which it was understood by school 
committees and school children of a past generation. When 
the former wanted to employ a “good disciplinarian,” they 
looked for one who could “make the children mind,” and, 
when the latter were enrolled in a school whose teacher had 
a reputation as a “disciplinarian,” they knew what to ex- 
pect. 
As the reader will infer from the previous discussion, 
this cannot be the sense in which it is used here. By disci- 
pline we mean individual adjustment in a school life of such 
a sort that it leads to that mental condition in which the 
pupils “have their passions in best discipline.”  
-P-A-G-E-194
  182 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
The diseiplining influence of a self-educating school 
A teacher may be sure that, in undertaking to develop 
with her children a school of the organized freedom type, 
she is in the way of diminishing the number of “discipline 
cases.” This is proved by the testimony of many teachers 
who have found it true in their experience, and the results 
of a study of the records of delinquency in a city school 
system points in the same direction. 
In this city there had been a general adoption of the so- 
cialized, problem-project idea in education in all the schools. 
After two years one of the principals tabulated the records 
of truancies and corporal punishments as found in the super- 
intendent’s annual reports for the two years preceding the 
introduction of the new program and for the two years during 
which it had been tried. He found that during the latter two 
years there had been a reduction in these items of about 
seventy per cent. No doubt other causes had been at work. 
Efficient health work among the children and a closer rela- 
tion of school and home must have had their influence. But 
the more natural kind of school life had very evidently been 
exerting its influence also in changing the school attitude of 
individuals who had found little satisfaction in the other 
kind. 
Discipline from the standpoint of a game 
Yet there never was a society of human beings in which 
some person was not at odds more or less with others in the 
group or with the group as a whole. It is hardly possible 
that maladjustments should not arise in the best schools 
and that members should not enter who are poorly fitted to 
participate in its life. To see just what we mean by “disci- 
pline” in such cases let us return to the point of view from 
which the life of the school is seen as a game.
-P-A-G-E-195
  DISCIPLINE 188 
Some people do not like to think of life from this angle, 
and they have little sympathy with the conception of it as 
an “experiment” or an “adventure.” To use these words 
seems to make sport of what is in fact often a pretty sober 
business. The objection is valid, if it means that we pro- 
pose to think of life as a long holiday of thoughtless frivolity. 
But, if from our recreations we can draw lessons that may 
be profitably applied in our more serious occupations, why 
not learn them? So, without prejudice, let us see what may 
suggest itself for discipline as we consider the contests of 
mature life and the “organized play” in which we engage 
with our pupils. 
A successful game requires rules 
As these words are being written an international race of 
fishing boats is being held in Massachusetts Bay off the old 
fishing port of Gloucester. By a misunderstanding of the 
captains the first race was started and sailed without the 
proper signal from the umpire. Although the race was 
completed, it was declared off because it had not been sailed 
according to the agreed-on rules. Now the sailors on the 
winning boat refused to accept the umpire’s decision and 
only at the last moment was the captain able to get together 
a volunteer crew to sail the second race. 
An intercollegiate football game is being played in a great 
arena. Rules have been agreed on to cover every contin- 
gency or circumstance that can be imagined. Umpires have 
been chosen to see to it that the game is played according to 
the rules. One of them at a critical stage declares a play il- 
legal. The players, if they are real sportsmen, accept the 
verdict and the game proceeds, but one side loses a victory 
that it thinks it has deserved. 
A great strike is at its height. Hundreds of thousands 
of our citizens are united in a common struggle for a larger
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
industrial reward. When the reward is within reach, the 
government secures an “‘injunction”’ that forbids the unions 
to engage further in the struggle. The strikers with a sense 
of “injustice” might have refused to abide by the decision 
of the umpire, the acknowledged government, and have 
resisted. The fact that they accepted the decision is the 
most convincing proof that they realized that rules must 
govern our national life, that citizenship is in reality sports- 
manship, that if a law (rule) has become oppressive, or out- 
of-date, it should be changed, but, to refuse to accept its 
enforcement while it is a law, is to destroy the game itself. 
Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers, the literary successor of 
George William Curtis and William Dean Howells, sets 
forth the need of rules in the games played by church coun- 
cils. He had been taken to task for advocating a League of 
Nations instead of trusting to the “unformulated spiritual 
forces” to keep the peace. The critic proceeds to say, “I 
had supposed that Dr. Crothers managed to keep the peace 
with his deacons without the aid of binding covenants.” 
The doctor replies: “This supposition is correct. Indeed, 
our happy state corresponds to one of the definitions of 
anarchism given in Webster’s International Dictionary: ‘a 
society made orderly by good manners rather than by law’ 
— though it happens that there is a law to appeal to in case 
good manners should fail.” 
Very early in their social experience children feel the need 
of rules. How often we hear little folks saying, “Let’s play 
this way,” or, “Let’s do it that way,” thus suggesting rules 
for their own guidance. Directors of playgrounds tell us 
that one of their chief duties is teaching children how to play 
together under rules. Quarrels and aloofness alike tend to 
disappear as they learn the rules and acquire the habit 
of accepting the umpire’s decisions. Herein lies the need of 
teacher participation in school-yard games, to teach chil-
-P-A-G-E-197
     1 ISCIPLINE 185 
dren the rules of games a 1d to help them learn to yield their 
personal judgments to ti:ose of appointed or elected judges. 
Nature’s laws and our rules 
When Dr. Crothers was speaking of “a society made 
orderly by good manners” he was thinking of one in which 
each member is living according to the dictates of the inner 
social law; that is, Nature’s way, as contrasted with the 
written law that could be resorted to in case one of his dea- 
cons, from ignorance or evil intent, should fail to be guided 
by Nature’s law. 
Now these two kinds of laws ought not to conflict. Law- 
making has in the main been a process of remaking the rules 
of society to bring them into closer conformity to the inner 
laws that are evolving our organized life from generation to 
generation. Our school rules should be thought of in the same 
way, and so they should change as the particular quality of 
human nature appears in the different groups of children 
who come to us year after year, and as we and they come to 
understand what living together successfully means. 
Self-subjection to rules is the goal of discipline 
Before considering the problem of the boy and the girl 
who, like the disorderly adult, does not play according to the 
rules of the game, it does not seem out of place to set up 
once more the goal that we shall keep in mind in all our 
“disciplining.” One of the ancients has expressed it thus: 
Men should not think it slavery to live by the rules of the Con- 
stitution, for it is their salvation.? 
And more recently one has written: 
Obedience is a hateful word to misguided pseudo-democrats and 
anarchists who cannot perceive that without obedience any large 
constructive liberty is impossible.” 
1 Aristotle. ? Richard T. Ely.  
-P-A-G-E-198
186 PROGRESSIVE ED‘CATION 
For some children the growth o} this consciousness of the 
necessity for rules and the desirability of yielding themselves 
to them comes naturally and easily. Marion Crawford, it 
appears, was such a child. This incident in his early lif 
illustrates it. ’ 
Marion had a violent temper as a boy, and he decided to get it in 
hand. One member of his family constantly irritated him to the 
verge of frenzy, and he invented a form of self-discipline which 
very few children would think of imposing on themselves. His 
mother entered his room one day and found him walking around 
and around it, carrying on his back a heavy wooden shutter which 
he had lifted off its hinges at the window. 
“My dear child!” she exclaimed. ‘What are you doing?” 
“Getting over a rage,” he replied doggedly, continuing the 
exercise. “When I am so mad that I want to kill somebody I come 
in here and carry the shutter three times around the room before 
I answer them. It is the only way.” 
Do you think that this self-inflicted reminder to be 
obedient to the inner law of control would have been equally 
effective in his case if mother or teacher had imposed it as a 
punishment? 
Children prefer order to disorder 
It is no exaggeration to-say that no child ever took satis- 
faction in, wanted to return to, or felt anything but pleasure 
at being released from a disorderly school. And this is true 
in spite of the fact that children in general readily fall into 
disorder, are not slow to break laws, and frequently applaud 
leaders of confusion both in and out of school. 
Yet the preference for law and order and control is 
fundamental and instinctive in all human beings. If it were 
not so, an orderly society could never have been built up in 
a world in which there are so many incentives to disorder. 
If it were not so, history would not have the long series of 
stories that it does have of revolutions that passed through
-P-A-G-E-199
  DISCIPLINE | 187 
the period of social chaos and emerged into social order 
again. So that, whatever our failures may be in trying to 
help children build up and yield obedience to an organized 
school life, we may rest assured that there is in every one 
of them an instinctive hunger for order. 
Discipline, a problem in mental hygiene 
It seems, then, that a child is “disorderly,” he is “ troublé- 
some” in school because of an altogether unnatural attitude 
of mind. It is different from that habitually taken by all 
but exceptional children, however numerous the occasional 
lapses may be with all normal children. What is the remedy 
for this exceptional attitude? 
The old-time schoolmaster knew only the remedy of suf- 
fering, “discipline of the strap.” But one who has studied 
his biology to some purpose has found that “cases of disci- 
pline” are cases of defective, diseased, or misdirected minds 
and that the remedy can be prescribed only after the causes 
are discovered. Thus each “case” is seen as a problem in 
mental hygiene. 
To learn how to solve such problems we must go to the 
physiological psychologist, to the specialist in the study of 
mental deficiency and mental disease, not to a penal code. 
The recognition of mental defectives 
In the past these have made a considerable part of our 
disciplinary troubles. Now they are being cared for more 
and more in schools and institutions adapted to meet their 
deficiencies. But teachers will always have “border-line” 
cases and pupils with irregularly developed minds. 
It is not expected that a teacher will be an expert in 
recognizing these unfortunates, for it is sometimes no less 
difficult to identify a genius than it is a fool. One may 
easily be mistaken for the other. This story is told of one 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  188 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
of the leading scholars of the passing generation. He was 
traveling with his wife on a train, reading and talking by 
turns in his usual nervous way. After they had gone thus 
for a time, a woman who was sitting in the seat behind them 
leaned over the wife’s shoulder and said, “I am sorry for 
you, madame, I have one just as bad in an insane asylum.” 
But, if we cannot become experts, we may know some of 
the signs of exceptional mentality, as we have come to 
know the signs of the common physical diseases. When we 
recognize the signs we shall be sympathetic at least. 
The following quotations from the writings of those who 
have given special study to this subject will be suggestive. 
From our study of backwardness we are now able to see that 
“backwardness” is not a disease, nor a fixed condition, nor even a 
\ fault.... All slow, dull, stupid, borderland, feeble-minded, im- 
becilic, and idiotic children may be backward. Some bright, quick, 
witty, brilliant, talented children, who may later in life become 
famous men and women, may be backward.! 
Sk ...No general description can be given that will be applicable 
to every mentally defective child and the following account simply 
states their main characteristics. 
With regard to their physical conditions, a small number might 
perhaps pass as normal; but such cases are exceptional, and the 
majority present unmistakable irregularities of bodily structure or 
function i in addition to their intellectual defect. . ..The cranium 
is... abnormal in shape or size in fully one half of these children. 
haaitieeia tions of the palate and then of the external ear and 
eye occur next in frequency to those of the skull. 
In some children there is a marked diminution of activity, and 
such are stolid, inert, and labored in all their movements. In 
others the reverse is the case, and there is an excess of movement. 
These latter cannot sit or stand still; they are distracted from 
their task by every little thing around them, and they are often 
full of tricks and habits. 
Speech, besides being late in making its appearance, is also 
  1 Arthur Holmes, The Conservation of the Child, p. 114.
-P-A-G-E-201
DISCIPLINE 189 
defective in fully one third of these cases. It may be remarked 
that inability to pronounce not one particular but many con- 
sonants is usually indicative of mental deficiency. 
Defects of hearing occur in about eight per cent of cases, but are 
generally due to disease of the middle ear; defects of vision occur 
in about fifteen per cent of cases. 
Active or voluntary attention is very commonly defective, and 
very few of the children have any capacity for sustained effort. 
In regard to things that are really comprehended, feeble-minded 
children seem to have quite as tenacious a memory as do those of 
ordinary intelligence. 
As aclass they have little initiative or originality, and, although 
some of them copy with remarkable accuracy, the majority are 
not as imitative as are normal children. 
Control is generally deficient, and action is more often the 
result of sudden desires and impulses than of any deliberate pur- 
pose. They are capable of the simple feelings of pleasure, pain, 
fear, astonishment, anger, surprise, and the like, but their emo- 
tions are usually weak and evanescent. 
It is, however, in judgment and reasoning that the chief defect 
of these children lies, and, whatever may be the condition of the 
subordinate mental functions just referred to, there is always an 
impairment of this, the highest constituent of the mind.! 
The foregoing constitutes a body of “symptoms.” It 
may help a teacher to understand an exceptional pupil, but 
it is not an infallible guide, for one who has had wide experi- 
ence in dealing with mentally defectives says, “The fact 
that a considerable proportion of children certified for ad- 
mission into special schools subsequently prove to be non- 
defective is proof that the diagnosis of this condition is by 
no means easy.” 
Dr. Kelynack gives three warnings: 
1. A few words may be said about certain conditions which may 
be mistaken for mental defect. Perhaps the commonest error is 
with regard to children who are merely “dull or backward.”   
ENS Kelynack, Medical Examination of Schools and Scholars, pp. 207- 
10. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
These are the least intellectually gifted of the normal population, 
and they are found in all schools of from five to twenty per cent. 
Differentiation may be very difficult, but I think that attention to 
the preceding points will usually prevent any mistake. It is to be 
remembered that the backwardness is usually confined to school 
work and that out of doors these children are quite able to take 
care of themselves. 
2. There is another group of children whose development is not 
entirely stopped, but merely delayed. 
8. Lastly the mentally defective child has to be separated from 
the imbecile. Theoretically this is impossible, for the one state 
merges into the other; in actual practice, however, if we exclude a 
few cases on the border-line, it is not difficult, for the mentally de- 
fective child can be trusted to carry simple messages, run errands, 
and do little tasks which will eventually lead to his useful employ- 
ment, whilst the imbecile can do none of these things.1 
Discipline of mental defectives 
It goes without saying that the use of force with these 
children is out of the question. Relatively speaking, they 
are in varying degrees irresponsible. They are clearly cases 
that require adaptation of the school policies to their limita- 
tions and needs. To this end these suggestions are made. 
They have been followed with profit in many schools: 
1. When a teacher is convinced that a pupil is sub-stand- 
ard, she should no longer hold him to normal stand- 
ards. On her records it should be noted that he is 
“special.” After this classification has been approved 
by the principal or superintendent, there is no longer a 
question of keeping him “up to grade,” neither will his 
poor record reduce the standing of the class. It is not 
difficult to have the other pupils understand this ex- 
ceptional status and they can always be brought into 
an attitude of sympathy and helpfulness, provided the 
1T. N. Kelynack, Medical Examination of Schools and Scholars, pp. 214, 
215.
-P-A-G-E-203
  
DISCIPLINE 191 
teacher has that attitude herself and appeals to their 
better instincts. 
2. A pupil of sub-standard mentality should be kept with 
pupils of approximately his own physiological and so- 
cial age. It is wrong from every angle to hold such 
children in a low grade year after year because they 
cannot do the required mental tasks. They will not, 
of course, be “promoted” in the ordinary sense. They 
will be adjusted in their school life with a view to reduc- 
ing their influence and promoting their own advantage. 
If in their case scholastic considerations are discarded, 
their own happiness and profit are likely to be increased 
and the disciplinary problem is simplified. In some 
cases it disappears. 
8. Freed from the obligation of maintaining a curriculum 
standard, a teacher is at liberty to give such a pupil 
special tasks, going an errands, preparing and distrib- 
uting supplies, even giving an extra recess, or dismiss- 
ing before the close of school. She will try to “direct” 
his energies on the plane of his abilities and interests, 
and not suppress them. 
The recognition and discipline of moral defectives 
Many, perhaps the majority of mentally defective children are 
quiet, happy, obedient, and inoffensive creatures; but in some 
there is present, in addition to the mental defect, a marked defi- 
ciency or perversion of the moral sense. . . . Such will lie, pilfer, 
and misconduct themselves in a thousand and one ways without 
the slightest compunction. Some are exceedingly cunning in the 
commission of their offenses; others will be guilty of atrocious 
cruelty to smaller children or to dumb animals; others will make 
utterly unfounded accusations against teacher or companions with 
such an amount of circumstance and appearance of truth as readily 
to deceive the unwary.!

192 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
These children should not be allowed to remain at school. 
School boards have ample authority to exclude them and 
they should exercise it more courageously than they often do. 
The meaning of temperament 
~ Our pupils have these varying degrees of intelligence that 
fix the limits of their helpful participation in the life of the 
school. But there are other personal qualities, for which they 
are likewise not responsible, that may convert one of them 
into a disciplinary problem at any time. One of these quali- 
ties is temperament. 
We say a piece of steel has “temper,” and we know that 
it is a quality due to certain substances that have been put 
into the iron while it was being made, and to heating and 
cooling. This temper determines how the steel will act 
when it is bent and hammered and pressed and loaded with 
weights and ground for use as tools. It is what makes one 
piece snap back and another stay put when it is bent. It is 
what makes one horseshoe stand more wear than another, 
and one razor blade take and keep a finer edge than another. 
The psychologist tells us that a human being has “temper ” 
in much this same sense, and that this personal quality is 
fixed in the process of his making. We are not more to blame 
for our temperament than we are for the color of our eyes or 
hair. Neither are our pupils. 
That some children are nervous, quick, alert, responsive, 
and affectionate, and that others take quite different atti- 
tudes is known to all mothers and interested observers. 
Before the birth of Christ a classification of these reactions 
was made by Galen, and he tried to discover their causes. 
His studies led him to think that they were due to different 
mixtures of four substances in the body, blood (sanguine), 
a liquid (phlegm), yellow bile (choler), and black bile 
(melancholy). Thus, he said, that an excess of the first 
 
-P-A-G-E-205
DISCIPLINE 193 
substance produced a sanguine temperament, of the second 
a phlegmatic temperament, of the third a choleric tempera’ 
ment, and of the fourth a melancholic temperament. 
Interestingly enough, the modern student finds that 
Galen was probably right in ascribing temperamental 
differences to physiological causes. The character of our 
mental and soul reactions appears to be due to bodily con- 
ditions and qualities. 
Temperament should be taken then into very serious ac- 
count in a progressive school. Because it is ignored or its ex- 
pression is suppressed when it becomes troublesome in cases 
of discipline in schools of authority, and because in such 
schools preference and undue rewards are given to those 
whose temperament makes them submissive and compla- 
cent, it will be profitable to find out what modern scientists 
have to say about it. One? tells us that it is due possibly to 
the way the heart beats. In tabulated form these are his 
conclusions: 
Heartbeats Temperamental qualities Temperament 
Strong, slow | Warm, impressionable, lively, changeable, | Sanguine 
cheerful, hopeful 
Weak, rapid | Sentimental, introspective, gloomy, pensive,| Melancholic 
unhappy, stubborn, sullen 
Strong, rapid | Energetic, hot-tempered, testy Choleric 
Weak, slow Quiet, slow, persistent, cool, calm, heavy, Phlegmatic 
indifferent 
Another scientist ? shows how the secretions of the numerous 
glands of the body affect our temperament, and he suggests 
that the differences in heart actions are due probably to the 
1 Howard C. Warren, Human Psychology. 
2 Cf. Louis Berman, The Glands Regulating Personality.
-P-A-G-E-206
    194 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
quality of nerve and muscle fiber and to the stimulating 
quality of the blood determined by these secretions. 
Temperament and discipline 
Our classification of temperaments is useful for study, but, 
when we come to analyze real children, we discover that we 
can seldom place one exclusively in a particular class. 
Temperament is a result of the fusion of all the inherited 
physiological qualities that make one what he is. The 
variety of mixtures of qualities is as great as the number of 
individuals. No two people have exactly the same tempera- 
ment, but, whatever it happens to be, it is probably fixed 
at birth.* 
From the foregoing we are able to draw some suggestions 
for guidance in treating our pupils, particularly when they 
require our special analysis, as all cases of discipline do. 
First. As the great mass of people tend to have a balanced 
temperament, it is probable that a teacher will not have in 
her school at one time more than two or three pupils who 
are temperamentally one-sided; that is, pupils who are ex- 
tremely vivacious, or slow, or changeable, etc. 
Second. As it is not possible for a teacher to change a 
pupil’s or her own temperament, she will not try to do it. 
She will rather accept both and give her mind to measures 
for the self-control and self-direction of those elements in her 
own temperament that interfere with her happiness and 
success, and she will try to help her pupils to do likewise. 
Third. The temperament of one person may be repellent 
or it may be attractive to another. A progressive teacher 
will not allow herself to dislike a pupil because his tempera- 
ment is not pleasing to her, or, for that matter, for any 
other reason. Neither will she allow herself to make a 
favorite of one whose temperament is attractive. She will 
1 Cf. Edward L. Thorndike, Individuality.
-P-A-G-E-207
  
DISCIPLINE | 195 
not be able to avoid having preferences, but she can avoid 
showing them in marked ways. A teacher has not the same 
privilege to choose favored pupils that she has to choose her 
friends out of school. 
Fourth. As pupils have different temperaments, it is 
evident that they can no more be treated exactly alike than 
can those who have different mental and physical qualities. 
The diffident should not be thrust into embarrassing 
situations. Many children cannot do their best thinking 
when standing up with the eyes of the whole school upon 
them. Many incipient disorders become large because the 
pupil is flustered by publicity. The unhappy one should 
be cheered. The one with abounding vitality should be 
given work to do. The plodder should have his burden 
lightened, perhaps. All these adaptations to temperament 
require thoughtful analysis and experiment. Repression is 
generally an irritant, or else it tends to cause trouble to 
break out in a new spot, like measles or scarlet fever when 
it is “driven in” by a chill. 
“ Springs.of action” 
This is an expression used by William James in his Talks 
to Teachers. If we could only discover these “springs,” 
many of our discipline problems would be solved easily. 
A little girl was entered in a private school because she 
had not been able “to get along” in the public school. She 
was troublesome here also from the beginning. She pulled 
children’s hair, she tipped over chairs, she booed at the little 
ones, and even opened recitation-room doors and made faces 
at the children at work. The teacher had given much study 
to the subjects, mental ability, temperament, and “springs of 
action.” She paid as little attention as she could to these 
outbreaks, and asked her assistants to watch with her to 
discover, if they could, what particular satisfaction the little   
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  196 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
girl was getting from her performances. After a while the 
teacher thought the child might be hungry for attention to 
an abnormal degree. ‘To find out whether or not this was 
the correct diagnosis, she invited her to come to the baby- 
class and read to the little folks during their rest period. As 
they listened with growing attention, their eyes fixed on her 
with smiling appreciation, the reader showed evident signs 
of contentment. When the period came to an end, the 
teacher brought it about that the pupils invited her to come 
again and, as she left, remarked that, of course, a teacher 
tried to set a good example for her pupils all the time, and 
not simply when she was teaching. The teacher’s course 
was now clear — to provide opportunities for satisfying to 
a normal degree this hunger for attention and to start a 
process within the child that would bring this impulse under 
intelligent self-control. 
These “springs of action” are sometimes spoken of as 
“desires,” “wishes,” “drives.” In Part I they have been 
shown to be the directing influences of our impulses. It 
seems that our vital energy has this essential characteristic 
that it pushes through its mechanism to satisfy some desire. 
It seems to be true that all behavior is due to this urge for 
some satisfaction and that we, teachers, are as completely 
under the control of desires as our pupils are. 
We do not always know what desire is leading us to act in 
a particular way. We deceive ourselves not infrequently. 
We thought we did this kind act or made a generous gift to 
help some one in need, but we later discovered that it was in 
fact to give ourselves an untroubled conscience. It was for 
our own personal comfort. Our pupils are in the same pre- 
dicament. They seldom know why they are disorderly. 
They might not recognize the real cause if we revealed it to 
them. But there is a reason hidden away in their organism, 
, and, if we are to apply the right discipline measures, we must
-P-A-G-E-209
  
DISCIPLINE 197 
discover it. This may not be easy, for the basic reasons 
masquerade in many guises. 
The different “springs of action” and their influence on 
conduct 
For an explanation of these desires and for help in inter- 
preting them in the behavior of our pupils, we must go again 
to those who have made a special study of the human mind. 
Mrs. Elida Evans has given a most interesting and practi- 
cal discussion in this field of psychology, namely, psycho- 
analysis, in her book, The Nervous Child, that has been 
recommended for the Teachers’ Library at the end of Part 
I. Another student of this subject, Dr. William I. Thomas, 
has written: 
We divide wishes into four classes: (1) the desire for new ex- 
perience; (2) the desire for security; (3) the desire for recognition; 
(4) the desire for response. 
(1) In his desire for new experience, a child may set a 
house on fire, just to see it burn, or he may build an igloo in 
which to live the strange life of an Eskimo. A boy may run 
away from home to see the world. He is called a “‘scape- 
grace.” But he is impelled by the same desire that leads the 
explorer and the hunter of big game into the wilds of Darkest 
Africa or into the frozen north to return a “hero.” The 
tramp and the traveler are seeking the same kind of satisfac- 
tion, the distinguishing difference being that the one chooses 
to satisfy his desire for new experience in a way that society 
disapproves, the other in a way that it approves. 
(2) A child tells a falsehood. If we could see into his 
mind we might find that the impelling influence was a desire 
to protect himself from the taunts of comrades or from the ~ 
punishments of parent or teacher, and not at all a preference 
for deception. So a nation acts in time of war. It spreads
-P-A-G-E-210
198 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
untrue reports about the enemy, self-protecting propaganda. 
And this desire for security expresses itself in noble ways 
also. To its powerful influence was due during the late war 
much of the sacrifice of those who stayed at home and gave 
to the limit of their strength and resources, and of those 
who gave their lives on the battle-field. 
(3) Dr. Thomas defines the desire for recognition as a hun- 
ger for distinction in the eyes of the public. A child may 
gratify this desire by conspicuous success in games, or on the 
other hand, by various kinds of disorder, and by “big stor- 
ies” (when told by adults they are called “exaggerations”) 
that draw approving attention or expressions of wonder 
from those whose attention he prizes. The college athlete 
and the social leader have their rewards in the newspaper 
headlines, in their broadcast photographs, as well as in the 
applause of their admirers. Fashions in dress hold their 
sway because of this primitive instinct. The king’s fool and 
the king himself in ancient times were acting, each in his own 
sphere, to satisfy this same desire. Silliness in children and 
their efforts to be “funny,” vanity in their elders, self-dis- 
play in its varied forms — sometimes haughtiness and at 
other times humility, a show of wickedness and of its oppo- 
site, sanctity — may often be traced to this common 
“spring of action.” 
(4) The desire for response is akin to that for recognition. 
It is hunger for approval of individuals. We are all subject 
toit. From it grows love of parent for child and of child for 
parent. Crimes most heinous have been committed to sat- 
isfy it and deeds most heroic. Children (adults also) will do 
unaccountable things to enjoy this satisfaction. A boy will 
stand on his head when fair Imogene is about to appear 
around the corner, for the sublime pleasure of hearing her 
whisper at some later time, “How wonderful that you can 
stand on your head!” It is the same boy who in later years
-P-A-G-E-211
  
DISCIPLINE 199 
selects a gaudy tie when he is about to call on Imogene in the 
hope that her admiration for it may lead to a deeper regard 
for him. What she will do of good and of evil to win her 
boy’s approval, fills the pages of history and of romantic 
fiction. 
It seems to be accepted that these four classes include all 
that are recognizable as “positive” wishes. When a child 
is angry or is afraid, when he hates or dislikes without ap- 
parent reason, he is taking an attitude of opposition to 
something that he feels by intuition will interfere with some- 
thing he wants.! 
Implications for discipline 
We see now that misconduct may be traced to the same 
“spring of action” from which good conduct arises. The 
desire that is calling for satisfaction is right in itself, but the 
means for securing it may conflict with others’ interests, or 
they may be used at inappropriate times, and thus, because 
they are disturbing, they are called “bad” by those who 
suffer. 
We may summarize our conclusions briefly thus: 
1. All the causes that produce cases of discipline in school 
are fundamentally natural and right desires. 
2. The pupil himself is not responsible for them — we all 
have the same desires. 
8. A pupil cannot tell what he wants when he is disorderly. 
The most insistent wants are hidden in his muscles, 
bones, vital organs, and nerve tissues. 
4. External repression tends to strengthen the force of 
these hidden desires, as it does the force of confined 
steam. 
. External “shunting,” or change in direction, of energy 
is better than coercion.

Self-redirection, due to a reévaluation of satisfactions, 
is best of all. 
This best is secured by changing the conditions so that 
there may be opportunities and incentives for experi- 
encing a new and more desirable kind of satisfaction. 
. A disorderly boy or girl, one who does not “play the 
game according to the rules,’’ should be thought of 
as a “patient.” 
a. Have a physical examination, if that is possible, 
provided the disorder is chronic. 
b. Have an intelligence examination. 
ce. Try to discover what brings him satisfaction in his 
wrongdoing. 
d. Experiment to find this out and to discover how he 
can get what he wants in legitimate ways. 
e. Start him upon the study of conduct as a problem 
in social adjustments. 
School life may be adapted to individuals, at its best 
it will be. 
Disobedience or disorder should never be taken per- 
sonally. 
Disciplinary measures should not be thought of as 
punishments, for no sins have been committed. They 
should be thought of rather as remedies in a process 
of rectifying maladjustments. 
Thus in brief the method of discipline derived from a 
study of the nature of children is two-fold: 
a. Diagnosis; finding probable causes. 
b. Experimental treatment. 
The use of force in discipline 
Whether or not it would be possible to avoid the use of 
force in the education of all children, if we only knew enough
-P-A-G-E-213
DISCIPLINE 201 
about their “wishes” and were ingenious enough to devise 
situations in which wrongly directed impulses would be au- 
tomatically redirected into right directions, the writer does 
not know. But he believes that, as a practical matter, force 
is properly used as an element in the experimental treatment 
of some cases of discipline. Even the poet Browning writes: 
All’s love, but-all’s law. 
There can be no school unless there is an orderly school life, 
and among children, as among adults and nations, there will 
be one now and then who will find his satisfaction in lawless- 
ness and disorder. One must have in mind an imaginary 
world and not the world as it is who advocates “peaceful” 
measures under all circumstances. Mr. Arthur J. Balfour, 
the great English statesman, in an address on the League of 
Nations has said: 
We can say with truth that, after all, at the root of society 
there must be the element of force, and there must be a criminal 
law for criminals, that the peaceable citizen may be protected by 
the police. 
So let no young teacher begin her work in school with the 
idea that “little dears” are too nice to be naughty, or that 
the older children are “such ladies and gentlemen” that 
they need no control. This is perhaps the most dangerous 
fallacy that can possess a teacher’s mind. It will produce 
inevitably a disorderly school. It has caused the failure of 
many teachers who have held it. 
The teacher is responsible for the order, the spirit, the 
work of the school. “At the root” of the school there must 
be the element of force to be called upon when the organ- 
ization of the school or the orderly life of a pupil cannot be 
maintained without it. 
But the teacher has a delegated, a limited authority to 
use force, and the community from whom the authority
-P-A-G-E-214
  202 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
comes does not approve an act outside the established 
limits. When a punishment to be effective must be severe 
to the point of questionable propriety, it should not be given. 
At this point it is wise for the teacher to say, “I am not will- 
ing to have a contest with you or punish you more severely. 
You may go and we will both think it over.” Back of the 
teacher is the principal, and back of him the superintendent, 
the school board, and the lower and higher courts supported 
by the police and the army. It is a part of our educational 
task to have pupils very early in their school life look down 
this perspective of organized force for the preservation of 
organized society. The writer has found that this perspec- 
tive view has sobered many irresponsible boys and girls. It 
has helped them to understand that the limitations of the 
teacher’s authority are not indications of weakness, but 
rather that there are reaches of control from which no citizen 
canescape. ‘Two roads open before them, and there is little 
that is attractive to be seen along the lawless road. 
It is not difficult to determine whether the exercise of 
force is right in any of its various forms — keeping after 
school, suspension, or corporal punishment. If there are 
evidences that the pupil is adjusting himself to the school 
life, the force has been wisely applied. If there are no such 
signs, if the same force has to be applied again and again, it 
probably has not been wisely applied, and the teacher will 
do well to make a new analysis of her pupil and of the situa- 
tion and try a different experiment. 
One of the many superior primary school teachers with 
whom it has been the writer’s privilege to be associated was 
accustomed to have “military days” in her school. She was 
one of those who had a school of freedom long before it was 
understood why this was the only kind in which a child 
could be really educated. But, at times, her little people 
lost the sense of order, so she said. Then she would talk
-P-A-G-E-215
  DISCIPLINE 203 
the matter over with them at some morning exercise, so that 
they, too, might see the problem as she did, and would sug- 
gest having a soldier-school for a while. This meant exact 
and prompt obedience to orders. They had military drills 
in standing, sitting, turning, marching. They passed to 
their classes at command and all the school life was regulated. 
After a day or two she would ask if they were ready for the 
free school, but interestingly enough sometimes they would 
vote to continue the military school another day, and occa- 
sionally they would ask to have it, “because they wanted 
the teacher to tell them what to do.” 
Is it not true that we all, even Dr. Crothers’ deacons, 
need this consciousness of the existence of a regulating force, 
“a power not ourselves” that holds our lives in law-abiding 
courses? 
Summary of Chapter X 
1. Coercive discipline, the “discipline of pain,” is not 
justified except as it promotes self-adjustment, for a “case 
of discipline” is a pupil who is mentally out of harmony 
with the school life. 
2. An organized community life must have its laws, so 
must a school have rules for its orderly ongoing. Laws and 
rules alike should be in agreement with the inner workings 
of human life. But even if they are not in full agreement 
they should be obeyed by all, until desirable changes are 
made in an orderly manner. 
8. There will be some who disregard school rules. The 
causes may be found in physical disorders, mental disorders, 
moral disorders, in temperament and previous education, 
and in misdirected impulses which in themselves are normal 
and right. 
4. The method of discipline appropriate in a self-educating 
school is the method of science — analysis and experiment. 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  204 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
5. This method involves different treatment for different 
classes of disorderly pupils — physical treatment for the 
physically defective; intelligence tests to determine degrees 
of mental deficiency with treatment according to their 
mental level; exclusion from school of morally defective 
pupils; a recognition of the basic facts of temperament; 
and some understanding of the influence of hidden desires 
whose satisfaction pupils are impelled to meet, although 
they may not be conscious of the particular desire that con- 
trols them at any time. 
6. Both the one who is being disciplined and all other 
children should grow in their consciousness of the authority 
that is ever present to preserve our orderly life, and of the 
force that is available, if good-will does not suffice. The ex- 
istence of this authority and force makes it unnecessary, as 
it is unwise, to exercise undue severity in controlling school 
children.

  CHAPTER XI 
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 
Education through the study of subjects 
We have been considering the life of the school as an educat- 
ing factor, and the way to make it educating in a progressive 
school. We have seen that children are educated also by 
their life at home, by their plays, their relations with adults, 
by the manners, customs, institutions, and ideas that pre- 
vail in the communities of which they are members. The 
original and still very large purpose of the school is to supple- 
ment these various educational influences by the systematic 
study of subjects. 
It is trite to state again that in the past those schools were 
ated high in which the pupils were able to repeat accurately 
hat the teacher had told them and what had been assigned 
for learning in a book. But now we are seeing that such 
repetition is no more a sign of education in a child than it is 
ina parrot. For example, it is not at all difficult for a very 
young child to memorize and repeat glibly a statement 
like this: “Gravity is the force that attracts all bodies and 
particles of matter toward one another.” However, he 
may not be one whit more educated after he has said it than 
he was before. He becomes educated only by increasing his 
understanding of what it means. 
In the case of gravity he drops a ball and a variety of 
other things, noting that they fall to the earth. He notes 
the falling rain and snowflakes. He learns that, when he 
himself falls to the earth, when he jumps into the air, he is 
really pulled toward the earth’s center. And so he continues 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
Ee Re eS i a Ee Ee ee EET Bl Pe ane TG eee eee 
206 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
| to note that clouds and the moon do not fly off into space, 
| and that for some reason the earth follows its yearly path 
around the sun, that the stars of the Dipper and of Orion 
maintain their relative positions night after night. Heturns 
to the earth and notes that the particles that make up a 
rock cling together and that this is what makes the rock 
hard. In time he discovers in the laboratory that the atoms 
of which substances are made also hold together. From 
| teachers and from books he learns that scientists have dis- 
covered that all these facts are due to the same attractive 
energy called gravity, and that gravity is what the grocer 
and the butcher are measuring when they weigh a pound of 
sugar or a pound of meat. He continues to expand his under- 
standing of the meaning of gravity by learning that a drop 
of water is round like the earth, that the airplane flies and 
that the balloon rises, all because of this same attractive 
force. In the course of time he will understand the way 
gravity acts as the mass and the distance between masses 
vary. He will come to realize that its influence is all-pervad- 
ing and that his own body is exerting a pull upon the earth 
and upon every one of the heavenly bodies to the most re- 
mote star, and that, although his own pull upon them may 
be unimaginably slight, it is yet enough to make him an 
integral part of the universe. 
Thus there grows within his consciousness a larger and 
richer understanding of the meaning of gravity, and, as its 
meaning grows, he is able to use the idea ever more effec- 
tively in his thinking, possibly in his business, if that hap- 
pens to be the manufacture of airplanes or the shooting of 
long-distance guns. This is mental education. 
Study is systematic mind-building 
It is at once apparent that this process of developing an 
understanding of meaning is not one of storing up the prod- 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 207 
ucts of other people’s thinking. Memory has its use, of 
course, but it is to record the understandings of meanings 
as they develop in the student’s own mind, to hold them and 
to bring them forward as they are needed. No other mean- 
ings have the slightest significance, yours as teacher, mine 
as lecturer, or an author’s found in a textbook. 
We thus come back of necessity to our self-education 
point of view from which our pupils are seen building their 
own minds as they build their own bodies by taking what 
the mind, as it is, can make use of. Only that new material 
can be assimilated which the mind, already built, can utilize. 
If there is not a mental readiness, a preparedness for the new, 
it becomes refuse. Shingles cannot be built into a house 
until the roof timbers have been placed and the roof board- 
ing has been laid; neither can the second story rest upon 
air. At least the supporting frame of the first story must 
precede it. 
Nature never makes these mistakes in its building proc- 
esses. It does not because in fact it cannot. Its method is 
growth and this must be a continuous process of inner 
development. But Nature is a “ hit-and-miss” teacher, 
and, if we attend her school only, we may find that we have 
missed many more of the meanings that we could use profit- 
ably in our manifold business of living than we have hit. 
So the school has been invented to supplement systemati- 
cally what haphazard Nature leaves undone or only par- 
tially done. But we get nowhere unless we follow Nature’s 
method, and, if we do follow Nature, our “teaching” be- 
comes converted into helping children systematically to 
build up their understanding of the meanings of things; that 
is, their intelligences, that is, their minds. 
If we hold to this point of view we are compelled, it would 
seem, to accept certain consequences that give direction to 
our helping.
-P-A-G-E-220
  208 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Guides for helping children in study 
1. We should find the level of understanding to which a 
pupil’s mind has developed in a given subject before we 
start him on a study of it. 
There are two questions that need answering here: 
a. What is the level of his general mental ability or 
maturity? 
b. What kind of a mind or what intelligence has he built 
up in the particular subject that he is about to study? 
The first question is answered with a considerable degree 
of accuracy by the intelligence tests, provided they are 
given by competent people and their results are experi- 
mentally verified. These tests applied in a school in the 
city of Rochester, New York, ninety-eight per cent of whose 
pupils were Italians, showed that “fully one half of the 
children who are six years of age are less than five and one 
half years old mentally.” ! From this same report we learn 
that, of fifty-five children in this grade recommended for 
non-promotion, forty-nine had a mental development below 
six years when they entered school. Here we have an 
illustration of what happens, and in the nature of the case 
must happen, when we try to engage children in mental 
tasks on a level higher than that to which their minds have 
grown. 3 
In few schools, however, is it possible to apply mental 
tests scientifically. But much can be discovered by noting 
the reaction to the subject. Does the pupil show signs of 
understanding in face, manner, or word, or is he indifferent? 
The latter attitude indicates that for some reason the mind 
is not yet ready for the work in hand.     
     
    
                          
      
      1'T, A. Zornow and L. A. Pechstein, “An Experiment in the Classifica-| 
tion of First Grade Children Through the Use of Mental Tests,” Elementai 
School Journal, October, 1922.
-P-A-G-E-221
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 209 
Just how those whose mental level is below the level of 
work that is prescribed are to be adjusted so that they may 
grow mentally along with those of the same physical and 
social level is yet an unsolved problem. But pushing, pull- 
ing, nagging, and punishment are not adjustments. Nature 
says, “Wait.” But no one wants to wait for anything in 
the twentieth century, and many parents and others in 
control of children will doubtless continue to press them 
into mental tasks prematurely. 
But our second question points to a mental condition that 
is quite different from that which results from deficiency or 
slow growth. A mind may be normal or supernormal in its 
native capacity and development and yet be unprepared to 
understand, because it has not thought enough in a given 
field. Life has not brought the pupil into contacts that 
have provided material for or incentives to the making of 
ideas in that field. A mind is made by thinking. The kind 
of mind we have is determined by what we think about. 
Therefore the child who lives on an isolated farm has a 
different mind from the one who lives in a basement tene- 
ment of a large city. They may have equal mental capaci- 
ties, their minds may have developed normally, bué their 
intelligence is different. 
In the past we have taught reading, geography, history, 
and arithmetic on the assumption that children in the same 
grade brought to these subjects the same minds. The 
studies that have already been made of the contents of chil- 
dren’s minds, what they know and their understanding of 
what they know, show that this assumption is far from the 
truth. 
In general we tend to pitch our teaching too high. We 
find ourselves discussing subjects from the points of view of 
our own built-up intelligences. Textbooks have this same 
fault often. They are the expression of the author’s mature 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  210 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
mind. We use our adult tastes and judgments in determin- 
ing what children ought to learn. Happily a beginning 
has been made of selecting textbooks on the basis of chil- 
dren’s preference, but such wisdom is not yet very wide- 
spread. 
Sometimes, however, we pitch our teaching too low. The 
time was when in night schools mothers and fathers of 
families, and young men and women, were taught to read 
with the primer. For these people with a rather broad 
education through their everyday life to spend their eve- 
nings saying 
I have a little kitty. 
She has sharp claws. 
My dolly has tiny feet. 
—is highly ridiculous. But our day-school practice is only 
a little less faulty when we restrain the pupils’ minds from 
leaping ahead because we fear to encroach upon the territory 
of the next grade, or, what is even less defensible, because 
we underrate their intelligence acquired out of school. 
2. The new material for study should be related to the 
understanding the pupil already has, and it should be in a 
form that can be assimilated on that level. 
If what a pupil says and writes is his own and not simply 
a reproduction, if he seeks more of the new after the first 
sample, we may be quite sure that his understanding is 
growing, that his mind has found nourishment. 
3. We should adopt a method that stimulates assimilation. 
In search for such methods those who have studied the 
mind and its ways have pointed out the importance of 
interest that sets the mind to work, of purpose that deter- 
mines the direction of its activity, of relationship with other 
minds engaged in realizing the same purpose. These ideas 
have given rise to the problem type of teaching and to the
-P-A-G-E-223
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 211 
socialization of learning that are discussed in the following 
sections and chapter. 
4. There are economical and there are wasteful ways of 
using the mind in what we call study. Pupils should be 
shown the economical ways. 
A few illustrations will point to what this means. 
A careful study was made recently of the difficulties 
involved in reading numbers.' It was found that in school | 
we are using a traditional method that has been discarded 
for some time in the business world. For example, we 
teach children, when they read the number, 23,476, to say, 
“twenty-three thousand, four hundred seventy-six.” Tele- 
phone girls, however, and those who read numbers in differ- 
ent lines of business, say, “two three, four seven six”; and 
they say, “five, four two” when they read 542. This is 
much more direct and simple than our school method, and 
it was found that its use reduced errors. 
In spelling it seems that a series of words can be mastered 
more quickly and easily if a pupil finds out by an initial test 
just which words he does not spell correctly. He then puts 
his time and effort on these. He also learns a particular 
word most easily by locating the point of failure and giving 
his attention to correcting that. 
We are told that, in reading, the mind works most effi- 
ciently if it seeks for the main idea first. To do this requires 
a habit of sweeping the eyes over relatively long stretches of 
print. This, then, is a mental habit that children should 
acquire. It will increase their success in problem-solving in 
arithmetic as well as their ready comprehension in all 
kinds of reading. 
We memorize a poem or any other kind of material more 
quickly and we retain it more permanently if we first under-

tional Monograph, No. 18, June, 1922. The University of Chicago Press. 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
212 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
stand it as a whole and then proceed to learn the thought 
units of which the whole is made. We also make better 
progress if we divide the learning into several periods rather 
than try to perfect it at one time. 
So there are skillful and there are clumsy ways of using 
the mind as there are of using a saw or any other tool or 
piece of machinery. It is true that one who has a mathe- 
matical mind will find for himself the skillful ways of doing 
mathematical work, and one who has a language mind will 
learn for himself how to read and compose skillfully; but 
others need to be shown the better way and to be given 
practice in its use. 
Two young men undertook to put in order a victrola 
whose machinery had stopped working. One was book- 
minded, the other was machine-minded. The former ap- 
plied the screw driver at once to the head of the most prom- 
inent screw that appeared when the mechanism was taken 
from the case. If he had carried out his purpose, the 
machine would have fallen apart. The latter, however, 
quietly took it up, looked it over carefully from different 
angles, dropped a little oil on one or two bearings and the 
trouble was remedied. 
A high-school class was memorizing a poem. The ques- 
tion was asked, “How are you studying this selection? 
How do you go about a memorizing task?” About half the 
class could give no answer. One said, “I say one line over 
and over until I can repeat it without the book, then I learn 
the next line in the same way, and so on through the selec- 
tion.” Several agreed that they used the same method. 
But one said: “I have tried several ways, but I have found 
that I succeed best by getting the idea of the whole first. 
Then I find the most important divisions. I try to picture 
the different parts as they follow one another and then I 
memorize them.” This young lady had a student-mind.
-P-A-G-E-225
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 218 
She needed no help in such a piece of mental work, but evi- 
dently all the rest of the class did need it. 
5. A pupil should not be cramped by another’s methods of 
study. 
It is possible to teach children the better ways of using 
their minds without pursuing them so closely that their 
thinking is hampered or becomes mechanical. For ex- 
ample, we say that, to understand a problem in arithmetic, 
we should 
(1) read the problem through carefully, ° 
(2) find out 
a. what the problem calls for 
b. what is given 
c. what process or processes of calculation should be 
_ used 
d. the probable, approximate answer 
In addition to these steps the author of How Numerals 
Are Read, referred to previously, tells us that the problem 
should be read twice, first with attention solely on the condi- 
tions, ignoring the figures; and again with attention, not to 
the exact figures, but to the significant parts only. That is, 
if the number is $1240.50, let the mind note $1000, $1200, 
or $1240, according to the conditions, ignoring the unessen- 
tial. 
Without doubt this is the way that a mature mathemati- 
cian proceeds in solving problems, and we should teach our 
pupils to proceed in this way. We might even put an out- 
line of the “steps” on the board and have them follow it for 
a time. But to continue this practice indefinitely will 
surely slow down their mental action and hinder the develop- 
ment of skill for the mathematically minded. The brain, 
the machine that does our thinking, is too vital an organ to 
be thus fettered. It tends to work so rapidly that the 
different steps in a process seem to be merged into one, as
-P-A-G-E-226
    214 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
when a “lightning” calculator glances at a double column of 
figures and states the correct sum at once. 
In Teaching Spelling by Plays and Games, Dr. S. A. 
Courtis writes: 
Each child is able to decide for himself the best way for him to 
study. Children vary so enormously in capacities and mental 
organization that no one method is best for all. The teacher’s 
task is to see that each child realizes clearly just what the goal is, to 
inspire him to make an effort to reach it, to reward effort, to aid 
by suggestions those who fail, but not to dictate methods. 
What is true in the study of spelling is equally true in the 
study of every other subject. Good methods should be 
taught. Special training in the use of them should be given 
those who fail. But methods of thinking should not become 
a sort of mental bondage. 
Individual and socialized study 
We are discussing education through the study of sub- 
jects in school as contrasted with other kinds of education 
in other places, and we have been considering it from the 
point of view of the individual pupil. But relationship with 
other minds is a condition of mental health and growth. It 
has been said that English statesmen have developed their 
statecraft first in the debating clubs of Oxford and Cam- 
bridge. Benjamin Franklin had no such opportunity, but 
he tells us that he early realized that to understand a sub- 
ject one must talk it over with others. He therefore 
gathered together from time to time a few kindred spirits 
and in their meetings discussion was long and heated. 
These are examples of genuine socialized study. 
The traditional recitation is socialized study on a low level 
What a difference, on the one hand, between the mental 
activity of the debating clubs of an English university and
-P-A-G-E-227
     'INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 215 
the discussion groups that gathered around Franklin, and, 
on the other hand, that which went on in the recitations to 
which many of us have been accustomed. What ordinarily 
happened in the recitation? The teacher asked questions, 
did she not, to find out if we could retell (that is, cite over 
again) what the author of a book had written. 
The writer remembers that some years ago an experienced 
seventh-grade teacher came to his office with her geography 
textbook open at two different maps of North America, one 
made on a Mercator projection and one on a spherical pro- 
jection. The maps were therefore of distinctly different 
shapes. She said, “One of my boys asked in the class to- 
day, if the maps of North America were all alike in the geog- 
raphy. I told him,” she continued, “that it was his business 
to learn what the book said, not to ask foolish questions. It 
was not likely that the textbook writer would try to deceive 
him by making different pictures of North America.” 
“Well, why do you come to me?” was the query. “If the 
textbook ought not to be questioned, why isn’t the matter 
settled?” She replied: “I’ve been looking at these two 
maps, and, for the first time in my life, they don’t look Just 
alike. Are they alike or aren’t they?” 
Suppose this teacher had had the same kind of mental 
socialization with her principal that her pupil had had with 
her, how much would her geography mind have developed? 
But by discussion, comparison, the addition of a small 
amount of information to her stock, she went away under- 
standing a little more than she had before about maps and 
with a new interest in the subject. 
The traditional recitation often misdirects study 
A fourth-grade teacher of exceptional personality was 
conducting a recitation in “language.” At one point in the 
lesson she copied on the board a sentence from a pupil’s
-P-A-G-E-228
216 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
composition that she held in her hand. Pointing to a word 
she said: “I do not think this is a very good word to use here. 
Will some one suggest a better one?” After some urging 
several ventured to propose a different word, but she re- 
ceived each proposal with the remark, “No, that is not 
what I want.” One little girl was notably eager, but she 
was holding herself in restraint while she intently watched 
the teacher’s face. Then the visitor noticed that the 
teacher’s face was very expressive. A decidedly unac- 
ceptable suggestion met with a frown, while other pro- 
posals were received with varying approaches to a smile. 
The little girl was, as the event proved, sizing up these 
various suggestions in terms of the teacher’s facial expres- 
sion, cudgeling her little brain meanwhile for some word 
related to those most approved. At last she raised her 
hand and, when permission was given, in her eagerness 
snapped out a word that brought a full tide of smiles to the 
teacher’s face and a cordial “That is fine, Mary. It is just 
the word I had in my own mind.” 
Here, it is true, was a socialized situation, but a mental 
relation, not among the pupils themselves, but between a 
few individuals and the teacher. It was also evident that 
the children’s minds were not engaged in language study, 
but in attempts to unravel the riddle of the teacher’s mind 
— “What word does she want?” One of the class studied 
this riddle systematically and solved it. Without doubt she 
became more intelligent in the direction of mind-reading, but 
surely not in the discriminating use of words to express 
thoughts. 
Many other illustrations might be given to show that 
merely sitting together in classes engaged in recitations does 
not automatically produce nervous activities in the brain 
that lead to the growth of understanding in the subject under 
consideration. So long as the mind is directed by a purpose   
-P-A-G-E-229
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 217 
to outwit the teacher, to please her, to avoid censure or 
punishment, in short, by any purpose that leads its activities 
away from systematic thinking within the subject, so long 
will there be little mind-building in that field of thought. 
The socialized recitation is not a form 
We see, then, that a recitation is not socialized just be- 
cause two or more pupils are brought together in a class. 
Neither is it socialized by introducing a special form or way 
of conducting it; for example, by having a pupil take the 
teacher’s place and the teacher sit in a pupil’s desk at 
the back of the room, or by having the pupils do all the 
talking. 
In a fifth-grade school a very lively talking exercise was 
going on. The pupils were telling experiences. One after 
another rose and made his little talk. The stories and in- 
cidents seemed to be enjoyed, but those who had a story 
to tell were just waiting impatiently to get their chance. 
There was very little thoughtful listening. It was a highly 
individualistic exercise, although it was in a social setting. 
It had all the earmarks of a period of mental recreation, not 
in itself an improper use of time occasionally. But, in the 
teacher’s mind, it was a socialized language lesson. Yet 
there was no specific language thinking here and therefore 
no growth in understanding of effective use of language or 
in understanding ideas that were pressing to be expressed 
adequately. 
To have a pupil and teacher exchange places once in a 
while, or even frequently, is in itself a desirable practice. 
It is good for the teacher, good for the class, good for the 
pupil-teacher, provided it works out well. It is not working 
well if the pupil-teacher is indifferent, poorly prepared, or 
incompetent. It is not working well if the class is indiffer- 
ent. Such a situation may have a socialized exterior, but
-P-A-G-E-230
218 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
there is little socialized thinking. To continue to force the 
form irrespective of the substance will surely dissipate the 
class morale. 
Having pointed out what a socialized recitation is not, let 
us try to discover what it is, by viewing it from several 
angles. 
The socialized recitation as an idea 
As an idea the recitation is conceived of as an intellectual 
game, or, perhaps better, as training for the competitive 
game of life. Every member of the class “gets into” the 
game according to his abilities. 
When the game is a new one, the players must be taught 
how to play it by a little instruction, a little practice, more 
instruction and more practice. 
As the game progresses, difficulties will arise. These will 
be discussed and ways of overcoming them will be devised. 
Leaders will arise who will find opportunities for directing, 
or, as often happens, it will be discovered that there is no 
intellectual leadership in the class. 
The teacher’s responsibility in a socialized recitation, 
thus conceived, is not difficult to determine. A few ques- 
tions will indicate it. If she is supervising a game on the 
playground; 
1. When does she take charge? 
2. When does she stop the game? 
8. When does she stand aside and watch? 
4. Does she ever give formal instruction? 
5. Does she ever leave the players to themselves? If so, when 
and for what purposes? 
. How much liberty does she allow? 
. Can she allow the same liberty to all groups? ND 
Where the teacher sits and stands and whether she sits or 
stands are details, not of primary but of quite secondary
-P-A-G-E-231
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 219 
importance. She should be at any given time where her 
presence is most needed, sitting near one or a group that is 
steadied by her personal influence, retiring into the back- 
ground when the purposes of the lesson are being realized 
without her, standing by to help an inexperienced leader. 
When she sits at her desk there is a tendency for pupils to 
direct their minds to her from habit, rather than to the dis- 
cussion of the subject. But this habit may be broken, and 
then she is no more in the way of genuine socialization at 
her own desk than she would be sitting at the back of the 
room. 
In this organized game in which minds are the players and 
not bodies, in which ideas are tossed about and not bean- 
bags and balls, the teacher’s réle is evident. She is coach, 
trainer, umpire. Her responsibility is twofold — to see that 
the recitation is producing growth in understanding and to 
transfer the conduct of it to the pupils as far and as rapidly 
as it can be done without sacrificing its educational values. 
But while filling these positions she is also always one of the 
players. 
The socialized recitation as a point of view 
That point of view can be stated thus: “Education is a 
process of growth, (a) in understanding the meanings of 
things, (b) in guiding one’s life in accordance with these 
meanings.” 
It is not what we repeat that counts, it is what we under- 
stand and do. Itis a process going on in individuals, but in 
relation with others who are thinking on the same under- 
standing level. Some teachers have conspicuous mental 
adaptability. Others have very little. All great teachers 
have had it, ability to discover the pupil’s mind and meet it 
where it is. But children meet each other’s minds naturally, 
so that they are their own natural teachers. Agnes Rep- 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  220 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
plier has called attention to this fundamental fact of child 
life in one of her charming essays.!_ She writes: 
The opinions of twelve-year-old Bobby Smith are of more 
moment to ten-year-old Tommy Jones than are the opinions of 
Dr. and Mrs. Jones, albeit Dr. Jones is a professor of psychology 
and Mrs. Jones the president of a Parents’ League. 
The movement to socialize the school life, including 
study, does not involve doing away with the adult teacher; 
it rather calls upon her to discover her pupils’ minds and to 
associate her own more intimately with theirs. But, in 
addition to this, it emphasizes the educating value of associa- 
tion of a child’s mind with those of other children, and it 
provides conditions favorable for such association. 
So this educational point of view produces a social em- 
phasis; that is to say, if one has this point of view, one just 
naturally throws away the manner and method of a peda- 
gogue (a driver of children), and becomes a trainer. The 
emphasis in the recitation is placed on pupil activity, pupil 
participation. 
Now this point of view and this emphasis after a time 
produce a social state of mind in the teacher, and, while her 
mind is becoming educationally socialized, her school be- 
comes genuinely democratic in its conduct and in its in- 
tellectual activities. 
That this is a growth and not the imposition of set forms 
upon pupils and teacher we may be helped to see by asking 
some questions pertinent for democracies. 
1. Do all democracies have the same form? 
2. Why is Russia in chaos to-day and why is Ireland in dis- 
tress? 
8. Are all kings able to transform themselves into presidents 
with equal success?

Currents.
-P-A-G-E-233
  
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 221 
4. When is a democracy, whatever its form, considered a suc- 
cess? Is any democracy perfectly democratic? 
So we need not be disturbed if every recitation is not 
perfectly socialized. The trend will be in this direction if we 
are committed to this idea, if we maintain this point of view. 
Direction of development is more important than its perfec- 
tion. 
ti 
How to begin to socialize a recitation 
A gardener does not expect to pick flowers during the 
first days of spring. Cultivating the soil and seed-planting 
come first. The flowers are often not gathered by the 
planter of the seeds. We should be willing — teachers, 
principals, and superintendents — to begin in small ways. 
A very practical beginning may be made with a teacher- 
pupil study recitation. A new section in history, geography, 
hygiene, arithmetic, spelling — in any subject at all — is to 
be taken up. Instead of assigning a lesson to be learned, let 
the teacher and pupils study it together. 
First — What is the section about? 
The pupils must “run through” it to find out. When 
half the class think they have discovered, one will give his 
idea. If it is thought to be inadequate or faulty, other 
ideas will be expressed. Perhaps all will re-read the whole 
section, and this is likely to bring about agreement. 
Then comes a search for the subordinate ideas, or the 
thought divisions and subdivisions. Orderly informality 
will be encouraged. Questions and comments will be wel- 
comed hospitably. Important parts will be located. Out- 
lines may be made, or a series of questions arranged, or sup- 
plementary investigations may be provided for. 
Some one may be wondering what pupils are to study in 
their study periods, if lessons are prepared in the class with
-P-A-G-E-234
  222 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
the teacher. Is not the answer to this that, if in such a class- 
teacher study some ideas are not encountered that the text 
does not treat with satisfying fullness, pupils are little likely 
to profit by further study of this particular section? Is not 
that one of the objects of the study together, to find out 
what is and what is not deserving of extensive consideration? 
There is no recommendation here that all study be of the 
teacher-pupil kind. We are discussing the simple ways of 
beginning to develop socialized recitations. 
After the socialized study of a lesson may come recita- 
tions with open books. If the book is not to be memorized, 
why keep it closed? Why not use books in recitations as 
we mature people use them in our private study? 
Pupils may prepare questions, a few at a time, to put to 
their classmates. Committees may take turns in making 
outlines and summaries. They may singly and in groups 
make prepared reports on matters that arise in discussion. 
In these beginnings, and later, teachers will have in their 
classes the same children that they had before they under- 
took to establish real mental contacts among their pupils. 
Among them will be, in greater or less proportion as chance 
determines, the indifferent, the inexpressive, the over- 
expressive, the excitable, the irresponsible, the mischief- 
maker. These may complicate the teacher’s problem, they 
will certainly retard the development of her plans, but they 
should not turn her aside from the direction in which she has 
chosen to lead her school. 
Illustrations of simple forms of socialization 
A fifth-grade teacher felt that her class was able to ad- 
vance beyond the beginning stages of socialization, but that 
specific preparation was desirable. She might have told 
them that she would like to have them conduct their own 
recitations occasionally, have proceeded to appoint a 
 
-P-A-G-E-235
  
INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 228 
teacher, and have taught them how to do it as they needed 
instruction. This plan would probably have worked well, 
for her pupils were of rather a fine quality. But she chose 
to give preparatory training through a school organization. 
During her informal before and after school contacts with 
the pupils she dropped the idea into their minds. It grew 
until several of them came to her and asked if they could not 
have a school club. 
A time was set for discussing the proposition during school 
hours. At this time, instead of assuming charge of the 
school herself, she began at once to put her plan into opera- 
tion by explaining the need of a temporary chairman. She 
showed them how to nominate, and to vote. She sat by the 
chairman and coached him, telling him how to stand, how to 
recognize a speaker, how to control the meeting. She did 
not hesitate herself to exercise necessary control over the 
excitable, and to set matters straight when they became 
somewhat tangled. 
Thus step by step the organization was completed, the 
rules for the conduct of the club were made, and programs 
were arranged. After some weeks it seemed quite natural 
for the pupils to elect their leaders for recitations in some 
subjects, and for other activities as occasion for them arose. 
They had learned how to do it. 
But again socialization does not depend upon the re- 
placement of a teacher bya pupil, however desirable that 
may be at times. 
A room full of sixth-grade children was reciting with 
geographies open upon their laps or desks. Wall maps of 
different parts of the earth hung around the room. When 
the visitor entered, the teacher was at the rear, pointer in 
hand, evidently clearing up some debated question. The 
pupils were half turned in their seats, manner alert, and eyes 
bright. The teacher’s face was aglow. Pupils and teacher
-P-A-G-E-236
  
  224 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
were asking questions and making comments. History, 
geography, civics, hygiene, were mingled so that at the close 
of the period one could not have told in which subject the 
lesson was. Personal observation, past readings, reference 
to the textbook in hand, the dictionary, and history were 
resorted to. Children were evidently free both physically 
and mentally, but, when self-control broke down, teacher- 
control intervened, yet only to restore self-control. Here 
was a highly socialized recitation under the direction and 
control of a teacher. 
In a little country school half a dozen over-age boys and 
girls were reciting a lesson on “The Surface of the United 
States.” It was the first meeting of this class with the new 
teacher. She was discovering her pupils and was conducting 
the lesson as they said former teachers had conducted it. 
Their books were closed, hers was open before her. She 
asked the book questions and they were trying to remember 
the answers they had learned. Evidently there had been no 
mental activity on their part in the direction of understand- 
ing the meanings hidden away in the text. 
The teacher meantime was watching for an opening 
where she could start the development of ideas. After all 
the pupils had recited, she asked a question that surprised 
them. It was not one they had met in the book. “Will 
some one draw a line on the board showing the ups and 
downs you would meet if you walked across the United 
States from the Atlantic to the Pacific?” 
No one budged, but they slyly looked at one another and 
grinned. After some persuasion one went to the board 
timidly and drew a very crude and inaccurate surface line. 
The teacher and class then began to discuss it. It was dis- 
covered very soon that they must specify the location of the 
line. This led to study of the map for an east and a west 
terminal point. It brought into use the parallels. It in-
-P-A-G-E-237
  INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 225 
volved the beginning of a series of studies of important 
cities from the point of view of their location north of the 
equator. 
So the line was made and remade as they together recalled 
what they already knew and as they studied map and text to 
make the line relatively true to facts. They discovered the 
contour key at the bottom of the map and it took on mean- 
ing as they used it. 
Supervised study and a quiet period 
We should not close our discussion of individual and 
socialized study without some reference to that term, much 
used of late, “supervised study.” At least five different 
meanings have been ascribed to it: 
1. Overseeing study — keeping pupils at work. 
2. Helping over difficulties. 
8. Talking about study — telling pupils how to do it. 
4 
5 . Providing conditions favorable for study. 
. Training children in the art of study. 
While all these meanings are valid, the last two express the 
vital meaning for elementary schools. 
It is reported that Dr. Arnold used to say to his boys, 
“You come here not to read, but to learn how to read.” 
All that has gone before in our discussion leads to the same 
conclusion broadened to include all subjects. 
It is not an easy task, that of teaching children how to 
study. We have not been taught how ourselves. Many 
university students, working for their doctor’s degree, con- 
fess that they never have learned how to read with efficiency. 
It is only slowly that research students are discovering for us 
the better ways of applying our minds in studying the differ- 
ent subjects of our school curriculum. Some progress has 
been made, however. We know better than we used to how 
to go about memorizing a literary selection and the arith-
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
metical tables; how to solve problems; how to study a spell- 
ing lesson; how to take an examination. We are learning 
the more effective ways of reading for facts, for understand- 
ing, and for appreciation. 
No one can transmit skill. One can gain it only by being 
shown how and then by doing something that way, by hav- 
ing the faults in his execution pointed out, and by trying 
again, with emphasis on the trying, because mere repetition 
does not carry with it improvement. 
This training in teaching children how to use their minds 
in their different mental tasks is best given as a part of the 
regular class exercises. The socialized recitation is pecul- 
iarly adapted to teaching methods of study. But individu- 
als will need supplementary help in methods of study as they 
do in understanding and in drill. 
But many pupils go through school without ever having 
experienced the satisfactions of study under really favorable 
conditions. They do not have them at home and the school 
has not provided them. We may profitably borrow from 
the Montessori and kindergarten schools their “quiet hour.” 
Elementary teachers who have set aside one period a day for 
quiet, undisturbed individual study, have found unexpected 
rewards. If one steps unobserved into a room at such a 
time, he can almost feel the mental growth of the pupils as 
he can feel the growth of leaves and buds in the quiet wood- 
lands on a warm spring day. ~ 
Summary of Chapter XT 
1. Education through the systematic study of subjects is 
the peculiar business of the schools. 
2. Mind-building is both an individual and a social mat- 
ter. Both kinds of study should be provided for. 
8. The recitation, conceived as a retelling exercise, is 
faulty in that it ignores the general intelligence level, and
-P-A-G-E-239
     INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIALIZED STUDY 227 
the specific subject intelligence level of the pupils, and also 
in that it does not provide for the development of under- 
standing of the meanings of the facts and ideas with which 
the lesson deals. : 
4. Research in the field of mental activity is revealing 
better ways of studying different subjects. These should be 
taught to pupils and they should be given practice in using 
them. This can be done without interfering with mental 
individuality. 
5. General failure has followed and will follow attempts 
to socialize recitations from the outside; that is, by way of 
changes in the external forms of conducting them. The 
form is unimportant and will evolve itself, if the teacher 
understands and believes in the idea, and starts in the direc- 
tion that will lead to its realization. She will accept what 
limitations she herself may have. She will begin on the 
level of her pupils’ present development. She will be gov- 
erned by their abilities and the signs that the socializations 
are bearing genuine educational fruit. 
6. Supervised study is most usefully thought of as teach- 
ing how to study and providing favorable conditions for it. 
A daily study period or “‘quiet hour” may become a richly 
profitable part of the school program.

CHAPTER XII 
THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 
They are unprofitable as mere forms 
Anyrutne that attracts our attention may be judged in two 
ways, by considering its external appearance or by studying 
its internal nature. 
Here is a watch. Its case looks like gold. Its hands are 
moving around the face, indicating the correct time. 
Scratching the surface, however, we find that it is thinly 
plated, and, looking within, we find toy works, an imitation 
of the real machinery of a watch. It will have a short and 
uncertain life as a time-keeper. 
An Oriental rug hangs in a store window, beautiful in 
design, coloring, and sheen. In appearance it is a hand- 
made, vegetable-dyed, antique whose quality has been 
proved by century-long use in some mosque or Bedouin 
tent. But examine its weave. Test its colors. Use the 
magnifying-glass on its surface. It may be a genuine prod- 
uct of a native craftsman or it may be fresh from the dye 
vats, looms, and “doctoring” shop of a modern factory. 
A young apple tree is covered in the spring with blossoms, 
while others, planted at the same time, have none. Are the 
flowers a sign of strong, wholesome growth or of low vitality 
that is being misdirected to premature fruitage? One can- 
not determine except by an examination of the growing 
conditions. 
So it is in regard to what we do in a progressive school. 
What appears on the surface is not in itself a proof of an 
educating life. We shall not, therefore, introduce problems 
and projects, any more than we do socialization, as forms, 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 229 
however highly they are approved. But we may be quite 
sure that the form will take care of itself if we set to work the 
living energies of our pupils which alone can bring to pass 
anything of genuine educational worth. 
Before discussing how we may begin to do this in very 
simple ways, it may be well to clear away two difficulties 
that seem to have troubled many teachers. They lie in the 
different definitions of the problem and the project, and in 
the reports of very elaborate examples of them in educa- 
tional writings. The former have been confusing and the 
latter disconcerting. 
Different. definitions are confusing 
Definitions have their value, but they are not useful for 
all purposes. For example, we find in the dictionary this 
definition of man: 
A human being; an individual of the genus Homo. Man is the 
highest type of animal existing or known to have existed, but 
differs from other animals more in his extraordinary mental devel- 
opment than in anatomical structure. 
How many of our man acquaintances should we recognize 
by way of this definition? A man looks pretty indistinct 
when seen through this telescope. 
Equally indistinct does a particular problem or project 
appear through the following definitions, selected from 
many. 
A project is a unit of educative work in which the most promi- 
nent feature is some form of positive or concrete achievement. 
A school project is a problem, the solution of which results in 
the production of some object or knowledge of such value to the 
worker as to make the Jabor involved seem to him worth while. 
A project is a whole-hearted, purposeful activity proceeding 
in a social environment.
-P-A-G-E-242
  230 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Each. of these definitions emphasizes one or two character- 
istics that are judged to be indispensable in a project; the 
first, a concrete achievement; the second, an outcome worth 
while in the worker’s mind; the third, whole-hearted, purpose- 
ful, socialized activity. They do not give quite the same 
conception of what the words “problem” and “project” 
mean, and some question arises in a thoughtful teacher’s 
mind as to how “whole-hearted” her pupils must be, how 
completely they must be absorbed in an activity to justify 
her in calling it a project. 
Complexity and elaboration not essential characteristics 
The nation-wide discussion of problem-projects has been 
illustrated profusely with descriptions of highly complex 
activities, involving a wealth of materials, not found in or- 
dinary schools, and absorbing the pupils’ and the teacher’s 
rather exclusive attention for weeks and even months. 
Upon reading these reports teachers are inclined to wonder 
how they can engage in such elaborate undertakings, 
hampered by limited resources, curriculum demands, and 
perhaps by departmental restrictions. They doubt possibly 
their own ability to direct such enterprises. 
It is quite true that, if these externals were the essentials, 
project methods could be used only in schools exceptionally 
well equipped and by teachers of unusual ability and train- 
ing. But they are not the essentials, any more than a Paris 
model is an essential kind of head covering for a woman, or a 
hundred-dollar Panama for a man. These are not to be 
despised, provided circumstances permit their purchase and 
use, but millions of heads have adequate and pleasing cover- 
ing made at home by deft hands. 
However, as the Paris models are studied for the funda- 
mentals of style and for suggestive details by thousands 
who have not the skill to create or the money to buy them,
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 231 
so we may find ideas, both in fundamentals and in details, 
from the reports of those who are using problems and 
projects under more favorable conditions than ours are, in 
the endowed private schools, the experimental schools, and 
where liberal and codperative administrative policies prevail. 
We may see in these reports the large educational possi- 
bilities that lie in these methods. Below the surface we may 
find the essential qualities, the heart of the matter. 
Then we shall discover that the terms “problem” and 
“project” are but school names for the common, everyday 
kind of thinking that we ourselves do and that every one 
does out of school whenever there is a purpose to accomplish 
something. The introduction of these words into educa- 
tional discussion is a very clear indication of the change that 
we are all trying to bring about in school — a transfer of 
emphasis from memorizing and reciting to constructive 
thinking, from storing the pupils’ minds with other people’s 
ideas to engaging them in building and using their own 
ideas. 
So, for a time, let us forget the names that have been 
more or less troublesome and consider the ideas for which 
they stand. We can find these ideas in the first chapter of 
this book, for in fact, problem and project methods are but 
the methods of scientific thinking applied by pupils in their 
study of subjects. However, as in that chapter we were 
considering the teacher’s thinking and here we are consider- 
ing the pupils’ study, it may be well to approach the matter 
from a different angle. 
What the mind does when it thinks 
On a summer afternoon you are lying under a tree. All 
nature is drowsy. You fall into its mood. The flow of 
blood slows down in your veins. Your nerve energies creep 
along their customary paths through the nervous system 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
    282 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
from one center to another. You are scarcely conscious of 
yourself or of the world. In a dreamy sort of way mental 
pictures, dim memories come and go intermittently and 
without connection behind your half-closed eyes. Your 
mind is idling like a machine when the engine is slowed down 
and is out of gear. In such a state you are on the border- 
line of thought, but you would hardly say that you were 
“thinking.” 
Now a leaf falls on your face ever so lightly. Perhaps you 
start. Your blood and nerve energies leap forward. Con- 
sciousness is more alive. But it is only a leaf, you brush it 
aside and lapse into mental idling once more. 
A chattering squirrel drops a nut from above. It arouses 
you again, but this time to fuller consciousness, and per- 
chance you take a keener interest in what has happened. 
If so, you wonder what it was that dropped. You proceed 
to investigate. You find the nut. You look about for the 
squirrel. Possibly you spy him, and contented you retire 
once more to the land of dreams. It may be, however, that 
some interest leads you to hunt for the squirrel’s hole and 
you find yourself wide awake, blood coursing through your 
veins as you climb the tree, nervous energies converging 
along the lines that lead to the seeing and hearing centers, 
your whole personality directed, focused by one purpose to 
find the squirrel’s retreat. 
What was it that changed the character of your thinking, 
so that now you are mentally alert and pursuing a connected 
train of thought, while but a moment before your mind was 
wandering hither and thither in semi-consciousness? Was 
it not something that “dropped into consciousness,” a 
something that caused the nervous machine to stop its 
idling and “gear” itself up with what had happened, a

                                What determined the intensity of your thinking and the 
duration of your mental effort? Was it not an interest that 
gripped you and led you along and more deeply in your 
pursuit of a purpose? ‘The falling leaf only aroused a pass- 
ing interest, it did not draw you into sustained think- 
ing. But the falling nut not only aroused, it also stim- 
ulated to systematic and sustained mental and physical 
activity. 
What, then, does the mind do when it thinks? It pursues 
a connected and continuous series of activities which are 
directed by a purpose and stimulated by interest or desire to 
attain the purpose. 
Levels of thinking 
Thus we see that thinking may be on a very low level of 
consciousness and of mental activity, and it may rise to a 
very high level where the mind and body are engaged in 
“whole-hearted,” concentrated, codperative endeavor for 
the attainment of an intensely desired end. Newly born 
babies are thinking on the lowest level all the time except 
when they are hungry; so are we, adults, a good part of the 
time. There is no work that the human machine finds so 
hard and so fatiguing as creative thinking — mental activity 
on the highest level.' Dr. Arnold of Rugby once said of his 
boys, “Nothing insults them so much as to be asked to 
think.” 
While diagrams are not very satisfactory devices for il- 
lustrating mental states and activities, they seem to be the 
only means we have of making tangible to a degree what by 
its very nature is intangible. The accompanying diagrams 
will at least suggest the growing complexity and “worth- 
whileness” of our thinking as interest and effort rise to 
higher levels, from a state of semi-consciousness to where, 
for example, we are making wireless electrical inventions,

Purpose directs our thinking 
What is it that causes the mind to rise to higher levels of 
interest and effort? The answer is “purpose.” 
I am passing by a show window about which a crowd is 
standing. I am curious, but only to the extent of slowing up 
as I pass. Another stops, peers this way and that to see 
what the attraction is, and goes his way. A third pushes 
through to the window. What aroused curiosity in me 
stimulated sufficient interest in another to cause him to 
pause, and in a third it developed a defined purpose to in- 
vestigate, to find out. Yet another is seen going into the 
store to learn more about the new invention that was on
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 235 
exhibition in the window. There may be a dozen or more 
people who follow him, each of them engaged in a different 
investigation because each has a different wish to satisfy, a 
different purpose in mind. My immediately controlling 
purpose led my mind to take but a passing interest in this 
particular window exhibit. But of the other passers-by one 
is interested in similar machines. His purpose is to examine 
it more carefully for mechanical ideas. One is looking for a 
present for his boy, and his purpose is to find out the cost. 
One is a hardware dealer, and his purpose is to negotiate for 
the right to sell it. 
So the kind of thinking, its intensity, and duration will 
be determined in each case by the particular purpose of 
each one and the importance of that purpose in his esti- 
mation. 
The minds of our pupils are controlled in the same way. 
The level to which their thinking rises, the extent to which 
they are absorbed in it, and their persistent sticking to a 
mental task are all determined by the purpose that possesses 
them. 
Let us note here that intensity of mental application and 
persistence may be as great on the level of knowledge as on 
that of understanding or of creative thought. One’s pur- 
pose may be realized on the knowledge level. If a parent 
sends a child to the store to find out the price of butter, the 
purpose is realized on the knowledge level. So, too, when a 
teacher assigns a fact lesson, there will certainly be no think- 
ing above that level in study or recitation unless by chance 
a higher level purpose is introduced. Again, thinking may 
be intensive and prolonged on the understanding level with- 
out ever rising to creative thinking, or, if the purpose is a 
lowly one, thinking may be almost of the “idling” sort. For 
this reason one is not likely to think much when he is copy- 
ing compositions or doing tasks as a punishment. The pur-
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
pose here is to “get by” and thought will proceed on the 
““setting-by ” level. 
It is the pupil’s own purpose that directs his thinking 
In the preceding illustration it may be seen that my inter- 
est, my thinking was determined by my purpose. The pur- 
poses of the other bystanders affected me only slightly. The 
same is true of our pupils. The kind and the intensity of 
the thinking that they do will be governed always by their 
purposes. This fact has raised for progressive teachers a 
most interesting question, namely, how their educational 
purposes can be translated into pupils’ purposes. Perhaps 
the way will be most clearly seen in illustrations. 
For example, a teacher desires to promote the health of 
her pupils. Exercise is one means of realizing this purpose. 
But children do not care to exercise merely for health any 
more than grown-ups do. So she finds that, when they 
exercise with the sole idea of improving their physical 
condition, they are inclined to be indifferent, listless, care- 
less. Exercise of this sort does not go far toward pro- 
moting health. 
But, without discarding her purpose, let the teacher select 
plays and games of various kinds that involve the kind of 
exercises she desires the pupils to take —stretching, turning, 
bending, twisting, running. These games they play heartily. 
They exercise with a health-giving interest and intensity, 
thus realizing the teacher’s purpose, although theirs is to 
have fun or to win the game. 
Wise parents adopt the same policy. A child has a fickle 
appetite, and refuses to eat the cream toast that has been 
prepared to tempt him. He is not moved when mother 
says she wants her little boy to grow strong and big. Her 
purpose does not interest him. But when she says: “‘This 
is Mr. Toast. He isn’t happy out here in this plate. He
-P-A-G-E-249
dee 
\ 
THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 237 
wants to go in where it is nice and warm. When I count 
one, two, three, you tell him to jump, one spoonful at a 
time.” If the child accepts this suggestion, he has a pur- 
pose that now moves him, and his mother’s purpose is ac- 
complished also. 
Let us take another illustration. 
A teacher has a very comprehensive, long-distance pur- 
pose to have her pupils understand the world in which they 
live. But this cannot be arrived at immediately or by a 
direct route. It must be approached by way of understand- 
ing the hemispheres, the continents, the countries that make 
up the world. But each of these is also too comprehensive, 
so in the study of India, for example, she selects the topic 
“Customs of India.” 
Here, as in the former case, the teacher will soon discover 
that Johnny and Mary are not stimulated to intensive, con- 
structive thinking by the teacher’s purpose to have them 
“understand the world.” If they are “good children,” they 
will, of course, learn what the book contains and strive to 
meet the teacher’s standards of accurate recitation. But 
they have no immediate use for an understanding of the 
customs of India and so the purpose to get it does not 
stimulate or give direction to their thinking. 
But if through discussion it should be proposed to drama- 
tize a street scene in Calcutta, or a procession of pilgrims 
to some holy place, the mental attitude would change at 
once, provided, of course, that this purpose takes possession 
of their minds. It will lead them to hunt for knowledge, to 
compare, judge, select facts, to construct ideas and to use 
them in verbal and material ways. 
The teacher wanted them to understand the customs of 
India. They have arrived at her desired goal by following a 
purpose of their own. To them the pageant was an end in it- 
self, To her it was a means to a larger and more remote end. 
   
-P-A-G-E-250
238 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Whether or not a purpose that orginates within a pupil’s 
mind or in the class mind is more educative than the one 
that is proposed by a teacher is a rather nice question to 
answer. Shall we not agree that pupils should be given 
encouragement, opportunity, and help in determining for 
themselves their study purposes, because ability to con- 
struct purposes — that is, mental initiative — is one of the 
main factors that make for success in life’s work. But is 
it not also true that some of our most compelling purposes 
have come from the suggestions of others? Many a man has 
been led into new endeavors by ideas put into his mind by 
some one else. They became his by adoption. 
We may then summarize our discussion of purpose in 
thinking thus: 
1. A pupil’s thinking purposes must be his own. 
2. They may originate within his own mind, preferably 
there, but they may be suggested by classmates or by 
the teacher. These latter are effective, however, only 
in the degree that a pupil makes them his own. 
8. Therefore a teacher’s educational aims should be inter- 
preted in narrow, short-distance purposes that pupils 
will adopt as their own for inspiration and guidance in 
daily study. 
4. Any evidence that pupils are engaging in earnest, 
systematic thinking is proof that the teacher has been 
successful in her interpretation. 
Mathematical use of term “problem” extended to all subjects 
Let us return now to our troublesome terms, “problem” 
and “project.” As to problem, it has its familiar place in 
arithmetic. Here is a very simple one: 
I have two apples and you have three. How many have we 
together?
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 239 
This is essentially a question to be answered, is it not? 
Our method of answering is, first, to be sure we understand 
what is wanted; second, to hunt around in the problem to 
find what is given us to work with; third, to make up our 
minds how to work it; fourth, to put the parts together in 
the way that our judgment directs to arrive at the desired 
answer. 
* Now that is just what we do whenever any question is 
asked us, or when we ask ourselves one, provided we are in- 
terested enough to make a thoughtful reply. For instance, 
a stranger meets us on the street and asks, “‘What is the 
shortest way to the station?” 
We must first make plain to ourselves what his question 
means. What station does he want, the police station or 
the railroad station? If there are two or more of the latter, 
which one? Having found out what the question means, it 
becomes a problem, for we must think where we are, where 
the desired station is, the different streets that lead to it, and 
make up our minds as to the shortest route. And so it has 
come to pass in late years that any matter that engages our 
mind in systematic, analytic thinking is called a problem, 
because then we are doing mentally just what we do when 
we solve mathematical problems. 
We know that problems in arithmetic range from very, 
very simple ones, like the apple problem we have previously 
given, which require very little thinking, to those that are 
highly complex. We also know that in the case of some 
problems it is important for us to solve them correctly, we 
have something at stake that we prize, while in the case of 
others we are rather indifferent. “What is at stake” de- 
termines for us the intensity of our desire to carry our think- 
ing to the point of complete and correct solution. 
Again resorting to illustration, let us assume that a 
teacher assigns a lesson in geography. It isa series of un-
-P-A-G-E-252
  240 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
related map questions. Even such a lesson has the essential 
characteristics of a problem or a series of problems for each 
pupil to solve, namely, ““What are the answers to these 
. geography questions?” He must understand what each 
question means and make an analytic study of the maps to 
gather the material which he puts together for the answer. 
But it is more than probable that his thinking will be on a 
low level of knowledge for the most part because he can 
realize his purpose without pushing up to the level of under- 
standing. Furthermore, his mind will act on a low intensity 
level because he will have no use for the answers other than 
to satisfy the teacher. The hunger for general knowledge 
is not very compelling in children. 
So even a map question is a problem. And, if one should 
ask, “How can I introduce the problem method of teaching 
in my school?” the answer would be, “‘ You have it already. 
You could hardly have a school at all and not use the prob- 
lem method.” No, the important question is not, “Do I 
have problem teaching?” but, “Are the problems my pupils 
are solving worth while in themselves, are they worth while 
in the pupils’ minds, and do they engage them in mental 
activity on the higher levels of understanding, and of con- 
structive thinking?” 
The specialized use of the term “project” 
Some of our problem-solving is carried on in the mind 
exclusively. An adult would solve the simple apple problem 
that way. But in his early number lessons a child would 
probably be taught to solve it with real apples, drawings of 
apples, pegs, drawings representing pegs, figures, and words; 
as, for example, shown in Fig. 8, on page 241. The pure 
mental thinking has been expressed here in a variety of visi- 
ble ways, including the use of concrete material. 
For another illustration let us suppose that a woman needs:
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 241 
a new dress. The dress becomes a problem when the need 
leads to a purpose to have it. The problem is first solved 
partially in the mind, then further in design drawings, in

making and using patterns, and finally in cutting and sew- 
ing, and fitting the dress material. | 
So also a carpenter thinks his problem in his mind and 
then thinks it in wood. The farmer plans his spring plant- 
ing and then continues his thinking in carrying out his plans 
in the fields. ~ 
Now, while the working-out of a problem, or, as we may 
say, solving it, in some visible, tangible, or material way is 
still a problem in that it involves the mind in purposeful 
thinking, one can see that it is somewhat different from a 
purely mental solution. It is one thing to plan a dress and 
quite another thing to make one. ‘The latter requires ad- 
ditional knowledges, understandings, and skills. For this 
reason a distinctive name, “project,” has been given to those 
problems that require the use of material in their solution. 
So we have come to speak of “shop projects,” “garden 
projects,” “household arts projects,” etc. 
_ There has been a good deal of debate in some quarters
-P-A-G-E-254
242 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
over such questions as these, “When does a problem become 
a project?” “Is an arithmetic problem a project when its 
solution is expressed in figures or diagrams, or is it not a 
project unless it is worked out in wood, iron, or some other 
material?” These questions are about as useful as, “When 
does a lamb become a sheep?” and, ““How many angels can 
stand on the point of a needle?” We had better discard 
the names altogether if we are to waste our time in such 
medieval debates. ‘The significance of these terms lies in 
this: that they point to the new educational emphasis upon 
engaging the minds of our pupils in purposeful activity that 
shall tend to have outcomes in expression on the construc- 
tive thought level. It is relatively unimportant what name 
we use to describe or classify a given activity. Verbal com- 
position, oral or written, is of the nature of a project, al- 
though some might not be willing to classify it as such unless 
it was a highly elaborated composition to be used for a 
dramatization. Our geography, history, civics, and other 
subject projects are not educational because we thus name 
them, but only in the degree that they lead the pupils into 
constructive thinking. 
t It may be noted that problems and projects are both 
individual and socialized. When a boy makes a table all 
by himself, it is an individual project, but, if he makes it 
couperatively with others, it becomes a socialized project. 
Both kinds have their important place in life and in school 
education, as we have seen in the preceding chapter. 
Educational enrichment from the use of problem, project, and 
socialization methods 
If we understand these terms as they relate to thinking, 
we shall find them constantly useful as standards in judging 
the educational worth of our school and as guides in our 
effort to make it better. The following diagram will in-

Teacher’s Question 
Focus of Attention 
Fic. 9. Raisive tHE Epucationat Leven or Scuoon Work 
Thinking may be compared to a river that begins in 
some underground spring, emerges to the surface, and glides 
onward in ever-widening and deepening channels. The river 
begins to do “work” when it meets something that it must 
overcome — a pebble cast into its smoothly flowing stream, 
a rock in its bed, a dam, a water-wheel geared to a thousand 
looms. But, as we do not expect a river to be turning so 
many looms at every point in its course, so we should not 
expect our pupils to be engaged in intense, constructive 
thinking all the time. On the other hand, we shall find our
-P-A-G-E-256
  AS PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
school becoming educationally enriched as we progressively 
transform it from a reciting into a problem-project-socialized 
school. 
The qualities of a good problem 
1. It will grow out of a discussion in which as many of 
the class as possible and the teacher participate. 
2. It will be related to the course of study. 
That is, the problems and projects should be progressive, 
as they are in mathematics, one leading up to and laying 
foundations for the next. However, teachers cannot be 
governed very much by this consideration until problem- 
project curricula have been worked out more completely in 
the various subjects than they are at present. 
8. The more narrow and definite a problem is, the more 
thinking is focused and stimulated. 
For example, compare the thought-compelling qualities 
of these subjects for a composition: Clothing; Hats; Spring 
Hats; Spring Hats for Five Dollars; A Spring Hat for Myself 
Not to Cost Over Five Dollars. If I really need such a hat, 
I shall do some intensive, constructive thinking (a problem) 
and possibly be involved in making one (a project) before I 
have a hat about which I can write a composition. 
4. The more potentially fruitful it is, the better. 
There is a problem to be solved in this, “Locate Five 
Cities,” but there is not much in it that one could think 
about. However, if the problem is, “Why Have the Five 
Largest Cities in the World Grown up Where They Are?” 
we have one with almost unlimited thought-provoking 
possibilities. 
5. A problem is a good one in proportion as it induces 
individual and group effort. 
One cannot prophesy about problems in this respect. 
, Sometimes one that starts poorly develops unexpectedly,
-P-A-G-E-257
THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 245 
| and again one that was attacked with enthusiasm loses its 
drawing power. 
6. The more varied the activities that are called into play, 
the better the problem. 
a, use of books d. composition 
b. construction e. drawing 
c. dramatization f. investigation 
7. It will call for individual and also for socialized think- 
ing and construction. 
Individuals, small groups, and the class or school will 
find incentives and opportunities to exercise initiative, to 
solve problems, and to contribute detail projects to the 
carrying out of a large one in which all are interested. Sand 
table, school store, schoolroom decoration, public day pro- 
gram projects are examples. 
When is a problem solved? 
Some problems and projects can be completely and 
finally solved, but this is not an important characteristic, 
except in the field of mathematics. In other fields a feeling 
of finality in connection with problem-solving is to be de- 
plored, because the subjects are not susceptible of final judg- 
ments. This has been emphasized in the chapter that treats 
of scientific thinking. When children are solving problems, 
they are engaged in scientific thinking, among the desirable 
fruits of which are 
a. an unsatisfied mental appetite 
b. an open mind 
So in many instances the answers arrived at should be con- 
sidered tentative, and many questions that investigating 
minds may raise will necessarily remain unanswered. 
From the teacher’s standpoint the answers to questions 
are far less important than the intensity and variety of  
-P-A-G-E-258
  26 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
mental activity that the problem induces the pupils to 
engage in. If a hunger remains, so much the better. It 
will lead to continued interest and further study. 
Educational products of problem-project thinking 
No complete enumeration can be made of these products, 
neither can they be accurately measured. Yet they should 
be evident in personal development. There should be signs 
of growth in 
a. knowledge f. open-mindedness 
b. understanding g. tolerance 
ce. mental courage h. social adaptability 
d. mental daring i. individuality 
e. ability to find worthy purposes j. interest in further study 
Summary of Chapter XII 
1. The terms “problem” and “project” have come into 
common use in educational discussion. What they mean 
and what their proper methods are is more clearly seen by 
a study of mental activities than of definitions or of highly 
complex examples of them. 
2. When we examine mental states we find that they 
vary from mere consciousness to extremely intense, pro- 
longed, concentrated activity. 
8. We find also that it is purpose, aim, desire, motive 
that draw the mind into these varying degrees of thinking. 
- The purpose gives direction and determines the particular 
method of thinking in a given instance. 
4. But there is a general method that is discoverable in 
all the different varieties of purposeful thinking. In trying 
to realize its purpose the mind proceeds as it does in solving 
a problem in arithmetic — it examines (that is, analyses) 
the situation that it must meet to reach the desired goal, it 
devises ways of meeting it, and it carries out its plans.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE PROBLEM AND THE PROJECT 7 
Briefly it thinks analytically and constructively, that is, 
scientifically. 
5. Whether the mental activity is slight or intense, 
whether it is simple or complex, whether it stops when it has 
found out a few isolated facts, or after it has memorized a 
few word-spellings or stanzas of poetry, whether it stops 
here or proceeds to understand the meanings of the facts, 
words, and stanzas, and continues on in its thinking to con- 
struct new ideas which it can and does use in various ways; 
in short, whatever the mind does and however far it goes, is 
all determined by what it sets out to accomplish. 
6. Of course purposes are often changed as they are ap- 
proached, either in a way to sustain and prolong thinking 
or to shunt it into unforeseen channels. But invariably 
thinking follows its purpose as the nation follows its flag. 
7. It thus becomes the educational task to have the men- 
tal activity of pupils engaged in realizing purposes that will 
lead to personal and social profit, so to interpret the large 
educational aims in the life of the school and in the study of 
each subject that the pupils’ knowledge, understanding, and 
mental attitude shall progress in the direction of these aims 
while the pupils are engaged in realizing their own personal 
aims. It is only in this way that their thinking can be 
raised above the low level of mere memorizing, repetition, 
and of mental subserviency. 
8. So it comes to pass that the term “problem” has 
been adopted to indicate this kind of purposeful, analytic 
thinking. A problem is not a problem, then, because it leads 
to elaborate, spectacular outcomes, but because it engages 
the pupils’ minds in accomplishing something that they 
want. This may be attained simply and briefly, or it may 
carry them far into constructive thinking and expression. 
Whither the developing purposes of the pupils lead, the 
teacher codperatively, helpfully, follows, provided their pur- «
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
poses lead in the direction of her larger aims. When there 
are no purposes, it is the teacher’s task to provide conditions 
out of which they will arise. 
9. Inasmuch as the extending of pure mental thinking 
into expression involves new problems that call for new and 
different kinds of mental activity, the term “project” has 
been adopted to designate it. A project is a problem that is 
carried over into some concrete form of solution. At what 
point a problem becomes a project is a matter difficult to 
determine and of little importance when it is determined. 
10. Problems and projects may be both individual and 
socialized. 
11. The products of problem-project methods of study 
are the same as those that come from training in scientific 
thinking.

  CHAPTER XIII 
SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 
What appreciation is 
Att of life is not comprised in aggressive activity. There 
are leisure times when the body and mind are receptive. 
“What happens” is not used, but enjoyed. At such times 
we surrender ourselves to the sights, the sounds, the odors 
of nature — the glory of the sunset, the song of birds, the 
fragrance of pine trees. And again we are lost in a story, a 
poem, a song, a sermon, a statue, a beautiful building, and 
when we find ourselves we are not wiser nor better, perhaps, 
but just strengthened, refreshed, and inspired. We have 
been in communion with something akin to our better selves. 
This is what is meant by the word, appreciation, for 
Fernald writes in his English Synonyms: 
To appreciate anything is to be deeply or keenly sensible of or 
sensitive to its qualities or influence, to see its full import, to be 
alive to its value, importance, or worth; as, to appreciate beauty 
or harmony; to appreciate one’s services to a cause. 
From this we see that, while appreciation is not a process 
of mental development, it is conditioned, nevertheless, by 
the kind of mind we have at a given time, its sensitiveness, 
its intelligence, its attitudes. It is the reaction of what we 
are to what presents itself for our approval, enjoyment, and 
possible inspiration. 
Individuality in appreciation should be conserved 
When we really like anything, anybody, any influence, 
we are surrendering our very selves to it. It is disastrous, 
therefore, to make pretenses. What we are at any time is
-P-A-G-E-262
    250 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
what our inheritance and the use we have made of circum- 
stances have made us. We are our own most sacred posses- 
sion, and when we say “we,” our pupils are included. In 
no figurative sense, the soul-salvation of these children 
depends upon the preservation of a genuine acceptance of 
themselves. 
That they will differ in their likes and dislikes follows as a 
necessary sequence from their differences in temperament 
and in quantity and quality of mind. But neither we nor 
they can unravel the tangled skein of influences that have 
made them what they are, so that we are able to answer the 
question, “Why do they like this and dislike that?” 
We recall in this connection the old Latin quotation — 
De gustibus non disputandum 
(Concerning tastes it is useless to dispute) 
and the French saying — 
Chacun a son gotit 
(Every one has a right to like what he likes). 
Shylock speaks to the same effect in the Court Scene of the 
Merchant of Venice: 
Some men there are love not a gaping pig; 
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat; 
And others, when the bagpipe sings i’ the nose. 
Masters of passion sways it to the mood 
Of what it likes or loathes. 
Yet we are deeply concerned that our pupils like the best 
in manners and in the arts, and in our zeal we thoughtlessly 
use policies and methods that tend to impose upon them 
our preferences. We put before them a picture and say, 
“Ts n’t this beautiful? It is greatly admired by those who 
have refined tastes.” Or we say of a poem or story, “I am 
sure you are going to like this.” Thus we have created a 
situation in which it is almost impossible for them to react
-P-A-G-E-263
  
SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION = 251 
sincerely. We have put them in a position similar to that in 
which we find ourselves when we are in the presence of an 
artist or a “critic” of reputation. We are inclined to accept 
his reaction as the proper one. Unless we are on our guard, 
we shall repeat his approvals so often that we shall deceive 
ourselves into thinking we felt what he felt, although at the 
time we had no particular personal reaction to the work of 
art in question. 
This is a subtle form of self-deception that in time saps the 
strength of our personality. More and more we inhibit our 
own reactions, we wait to find out how others are going to 
feel, and we take over their sayings, their judgments, even 
their enthusiasms and ecstasies and plume ourselves with 
them. 
Of course this is the farthest removed from the result we 
desire to arrive at in our “appreciation lessons,” yet it is the 
result that follows naturally from our method. However, 
before we formulate other methods, it is desirable to examine 
the nature of appreciation a little further. 
Appreciation on different levels 
Our reaction to what we see, hear, feel, taste, smell, 
touch, and to what we read and think about may be on the 
level of sense impressions, or of understanding, or of ideals. 
When appreciation involves all three levels our reaction is 
stronger, richer, more stimulating, and more completely 
satisfying than it is when it remains on the first or second 
level. 
To illustrate: 
Color — A rainbow appears in the sky. 
On the level of sense impression, we see the colors and 
we say, “How pretty.” 
On the level of understanding, we see the colors, but in 
addition we know that they are due to an infinite number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  
252 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
raindrops, each one a prism through which a ray of light is 
passing and in its passage is broken into the spectrum colors. 
We know that the drops of water from which the different 
colors come to our eyes so that we see a rainbow are not the 
same drops from which the rays come to the eyes of one 
standing next to us. We know that, if there are a thousand 
people looking at the rainbow, there must be a thousand 
rainbows, although all seem to be looking at the same 
one. So we look at our rainbow and say, “How wonder- 
ful.” 
On the level of the ideal we see the rainbow as a promise 
of God to his people: 
And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make be- 
tween me and you and every living creature that is with you for 
perpetual generations: I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be 
for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. And it shall 
come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow 
shall be seen in the cloud, and I will remember my covenant; and 
the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh. 
For him who sees the rainbow thus, it is a message from 
the creative mind. He stands awed, he is uplifted by a 
sort of divine inspiration, he worships. This is the level of 
beauty. 
Form — A cross rises from a church steeple. 
On the level of sense, it is but two pieces of wood fastened 
together at right angles. In proportion it may be pleasing, 
but to a savage it is but a shape, no more to be noted than a 
circle or a square. 
On the level of understanding, a carpenter sees it as a piece 
of joiner work. A Mohammedan knows it as a symbol in 
the religious life of other peoples. He thinks of it along with 
totem poles and prayer wheels. He understands its signifi- 
cance to others, but it does not move him. 
On the level of the ideal, the cross unites the human and-
-P-A-G-E-265
  SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 253 
divine in the life and sacrifice of Christ. It inspires humility, 
hope, reverence, adoration in those to whom it is thus a 
symbol. 
Taste — A slice of bread. 
On the level of sense, it is food to the hungry. 
On the level of understanding, it is to the cook a mixture 
of flour, yeast, and other ingredients that would have been 
just a bit “lighter” if it had not baked quite so fast. 
On the level of the ideal, it is to Jews in the Passover 
Bread a reminder of the goodness of God in their time of 
need, and to Christians in the Communion Bread the body 
of Christ or a symbol of it. 
Feeling — The feel of a hand. 
On the level of sense, we like or we do not like the feel of 
the hand we shake when we are introduced to a stranger, 
or possibly we may scarcely feel the hand we touch. 
On the level of understanding, the doctor feels a hand to 
determine its warmth, the dryness of the skin. He is inter- 
ested in learning something by feeling. 
On the level of the ideal, the lover seeks the hand of the 
loved one and is thrilled at its touch. So the touch of a 
baby hand stirs the mother, inspires her and becomes the 
dominating control of her life. 
Odors — The perfume of incense fills the room. It is 
merely pleasing or disagreeable in its effect upon our sense of 
smell. 
On the level of understanding, the dealer in incense, the 
manufacturer, the connoisseur distinguishes by the odor the 
Hindu, the Chinese, the American makes. His intelligence 
is brought into play and not alone his senses. 
On the level of the ideal, the worshiper is led into religious 
attitudes of mind, to worship. He is sensitive to it as a 
religious influence. 
Sound — The church bells are ringing. 
   
-P-A-G-E-266
  j 
254 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
On the level of sense perception, the tone and quality 
please us. 
On the level of understanding, we know that the bells are 
calling the faithful to prayer and worship, but they make no 
appeal to us. We may know how bells are made and the 
' quality of tone that a certain maker alone can produce. We 
may know the history of a bell or a chime of bells. But these 
are all facts, thought on the understanding level. 
On the level of the ideal, the devout religionist feels the 
bells calling him. Memories of the past, sorrows, pleasures, 
and the spiritual comfort and uplift of worship give value, a 
sense of worth to the sounds. 
It must have been on this level of appreciation that 
Thomas Moore wrote: 
THOSE EVENING BELLS 
Those evening bells! those evening bells! 
How many a tale their music tells 
Of youth, and home, and that sweet time 
When last I heard their soothing chime! 
Those joyous hours are passed away; 
And many a heart, that then was gay, 
Within the tomb now darkly dwells, 
And hears no more those evening bells. 
And so ’t will be when I am gone; 
That tuneful peal will still ring on, 
While other bards shall walk these dells, 
And sing your praise, sweet evening bells. 
Degrees of appreciation 
When we say that appreciation is on three different levels, 
namely, of sense, of understanding, of ideals or of the spirit, 
we do not mean to say that length of life alone determines 
what the level of our appreciation is in a particular instance.
-P-A-G-E-267
SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 255 
This is far from the truth. Many a child thinks and feels 
in some situations on a much more spiritual plane than do 
his elders. It is a matter of experience, of “what one has 
done with what happens,” more than it is a matter of age, 
and we can say this without belittling the enrichment that 
the ongoing years bring to every one in some degree. And 
children of the same age differ in this respect also. An 
incident illustrating this comes to mind in Dombey and Son, 
an old-fashioned story, but very true to life in its essentials. 
We recall that Paul Dombey had been placed in a school 
by the seashore. His room looked out over the ocean and he 
spent much time by the window musing. His practical- 
minded friend, Toots, could not at all understand how one 
could waste leisure that way, and on one occasion he sought 
him out determined to get light on the riddle. 
- PAUL AND TOOTS LOOK AT THE OCEAN TOGETHER 
One evening Mr. Toots was sitting at his desk, oppressed by cor- 
respondence, when a great purpose seemed to flash upon him. He 
laid down his pen, and went off to seek Paul, whom he found at last, 
after a long search, looking through the window of his little bed- 
room. 
“Tsay!” cried Toots, speaking the moment he entered the room, 
lest he should forget it; “‘what do you think about?” 
“Oh! I think about a great many things,” replied Paul. 
“Do you, though!” said Toots, appearing to consider that fact in 
itself surprising. 
“Tf you had to die,” said Paul, looking up into his face — 
Mr. Toots started, and seemed much disturbed. 
“Don’t you think you would rather die on a moonlight 
night, when the sky was quite clear, and the wind blowing, as it 
did last night?” 
Mr. Toots said, looking doubtfully at Paul, and shaking his head, 
that he did n’t know about that. 
“Not blowing, at least,” said Paul, “‘but sounding in the air like 
the sea sounds in the shells. It was a beautiful night. When I had 
listened to the water for a long time, I got up and I looked out.  
-P-A-G-E-268

There was a boat over there, in the ve light of the moon; a boat 
with a sail.” 
The child looked at him so steadfas' hy, and spoke so earnestly, 
that Mr. Toots, feeling himself called upon to say something about 
this boat, said, “Smugglers.” But with an impartial remembrance 
of there being two sides to every question, he added, “‘or Preven- 
tive.” 
“A boat with a sail,” repeated Paul, “in the full light of the 
moon. The sail like an arm, all silver. It went away into the dis- 
tance, and what do you think it seemed to do as it moved with the 
waves?” 
“Pitch,” said Mr. Toots. 
“Tt seemed to beckon,” said the child, “to beckon me to come!” 
Here were two boys, facing the same facts, with the same 
knowledge doubtless regarding what they saw, and yet their 
appreciation differed, not only in kind, but in intensity. 
The level of our appreciation is the level of our developed minds 
If it is difficult for us to realize the limitations of our pupils’ 
understanding because of the immaturity, the undeveloped 
condition of their brain areas, it is even more difficult for us 
to realize that their capacity for appreciation is also limited 
by their past experiences. They, like ourselves, have no 
appreciation of that of which they are ignorant, of that to 
which there is not something akin in their own minds, of that 
to which they are not to a degree attuned. 
Illustrations are the best eyeglasses through which to see 
the truth. 
Madame Montessori gives an incident that points to 
limited capacity of appreciation for lack of the related kind 
of sense training. She writes: _ 
One day I heard a surgeon giving to a number of poor mothers a 
lesson on the recognition of the first deformities noticeable in little 
children from the disease of rickets. It was his hope to lead these 
mothers to bring to him their children who were suffering from this 
disease while it was yet in the earliest stages and when medical help
-P-A-G-E-269
  
SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 257 
might still be efficacious. The mothers understood the idea, but 
they did not know how to recognize these first signs of deformity, 
because they were lacking in the sensory education through which they 
might discriminate between signs deviating only slightly from the 
normal. Therefore these lessons were useless. 
To take another illustration: 
There is in the city of Boston a memorial to Phillips Brooks, 
the great New England preacher of the past generation. It 
is by Saint-Gaudens. Under a pulpit canopy the preacher 
stands as he did in life with outstretched arm delivering his 
message. Just behind, resting one hand on the preacher’s 
shoulder, is a figure representing Christ, and in the back- 
ground rises a cross so large as to dominate the group. 
Those who stand before this memorial may be divided into 
three classes from the standpoint of their appreciative re- 
action. 
One class see it as a group of bronze figures only. They 
know nothing of the man or his message or the religious at- 
titudes of the times in which it was given. To them the 
preacher is too youthful to be impressive, the figure of 
Christ is a bit incongruous, and the cross is out of proportion 
and intrusive. On the level of sense perception, few people 
seem to be impressed by this memorial. In fact, popular 
disapproval has been so strong that its removal was pro- 
posed. This was prevented only by an adverse decision of 
the State Supreme Court. 
Another class of people stand before this group of figures. 
They are artists, artisans, and those who think of Phillips 
Brooks as an historic personage. Their appreciation is on 
the level of artistic standards, of workmanship, and of 
historic truthfulness and suggestiveness. 
And there is a third class of people who carry to the ap- 
1 Maria Montessori, The Montessori Method, p. 220. By courtesy of 
Frederick A. Stokes Co., New York.
-P-A-G-E-270
  
  258 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
preciation of the memorial minds into whose making have 
gone influences from the great preacher’s words and life, 
who were a part of the generation to which he delivered his 
message of the divinely human Christ, a Christ whose life 
was dominated by the cross. These people do not think of 
Phillips Brooks as one who could or did grow old, but as the 
incarnation of eternal youth giving and interpreting to his 
day the message from God through Christ by way of the 
Cross for the healing, the rejuvenating of individuals and of 
nations. To those whose minds are stored with ideas relat- 
ing to the preacher and his times, whose ideals draw them 
into sympathy, it is an increasingly satisfying reminder of a 
great preacher and of the greater personality and of the 
ideals that controlled and inspired him. 
So it seems that our appreciation is not determined by 
what there is in a work of art, but by the level of develop- 
ment of our minds in the field of ideas that the artist was try- 
ing to express. We may go even further and say that what 
we admire in a person, a work of art, a bit of nature is what 
we put into it. 
We appreciate what we ourselves put into things 
It is said that Robert Browning, on being asked what he 
meant when he wrote a certain stanza in one of his poems, 
replied that he had quite forgotten what he did mean, and 
that any one was at liberty to put into it such meaning as he 
liked. 
This is what Browning himself did to a “certain star”: 
MY STAR 
All that I know 
Of a certain star 
Ts, it can throw 
(Like the angled spar)
-P-A-G-E-271
  SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 259 
Now a dart of red, 
Now a dart of blue: 
Till my friends have said 
They would fain see, too, 
My star that dartles the red and the blue! 
Then it stops like a bird; like a flower, hangs furled: 
They must solace themselves with the Saturn above it. 
What matter to me if their star is a world? 
Mine has opened its soul to me; therefore I love it. 
What was it that the poet really loved here? The star 
was an incandescent world millions of miles away: of course, 
without mind or soul or any other human quality. What he 
loved — was it not his own soul that he had put into it? 
A nude statue is vulgar or divine as we endow it with 
vulgarity or divinity by our own thinking. It is but a 
block of marble, but how differently different people 
view it. 
_ As Browning implied in the reply to his questioner 
above, what we put into things is vastly more significant 
than what the writer or artist had in mind. What he 
is expressing is important to him, but to others it does 
not matter. The curious will want to know what the 
creator of a work of art meant, but, if they find out, the 
knowledge counts for little. It does not enrich their ap- 
preciation much. A musician was asked, by one who 
wanted to “listen intelligently” while the “Spring Song” 
was being played, what Mendelssohn had in mind when 
he composed it. He replied: “Don’t bother with that. 
Give yourself up to the music. If you find yourself reliv- 
ing springtime moods, those are the only meanings of conse- 
quence to you. Don’t strive, however, to recall them, for 
the ‘Spring Song’ may be for you simply beautiful sounds, 
and it cannot be anything else to you by merely trying.” 
It is so, is it not, with the portraits of our friends? They 
are but effigies, shadows of people cast on sensitized paper,
-P-A-G-E-272
   
260 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
but every time we look at them, we make them live with the 
thoughts and feelings of our own minds and hearts. 
In our appreciations we are like Narcissus who fell in love 
with his own reflection in the pool, or like Pygmalion who 
became enamoured with the statue that he himself had made, 
so successful had he been in endowing the lifeless marble with 
his own ideals of womanhood. 
Some hindrances to immediate appreciation 
Everything that appeals to us for appreciation has two 
phases, form and meaning. 
In some instances the form may be pleasing, but the 
meaning may be insignificant or obscure. Mother Goose 
rhymes, nonsense verse, ragtime music, Brownie pictures, 
much popular fiction, are examples of the former, and the 
Venus of Milo is an example of a beautiful form concealing 
its meaning. | 
There may be deep meaning expressed in what to us is un- 
pleasing form. Doré’s illustrations of Dante’s Inferno are 
examples, and some of Rodin’s statues, and Sargent’s frescoes 
and Henry James’s writings. 
The highest art is meaning that makes a universal appeal 
expressed adequately in appropriate form. 
But the form may not be pleasing at first because it is 
unusual, unconventional, unfamiliar. For that reason we 
do not like at once a new style of hat or dress that we come 
to admire as we get used to it. Japanese art was for a long 
time considered crude by Western artists, but now these same 
artists appreciate it for its exquisite refinement. This, of 
course, is why we have little appreciation of literature in a 
foreign language with which we are not on intimate terms. 
So again we come to the point where we see that we ap- 
preciate only what we are prepared to appreciate. One may 
not care for a picture or any other work of art, either be- 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 261 
cause he himself has not a stock of ideas that are akin to 
those suggested by the object, or because the form is so 
different from that to which he is accustomed that he finds 
himself unable to put any thought or feeling into it. 
Examples from literature 
These different hindrances to children’s appreciation have 
been little considered by the makers of our school reading 
books when making their selections of poetry. The burden 
of responsibility to recognize these difficulties and to provide 
for them rests, therefore, upon teachers. The following il- 
lustrations will help to make the general statements of the 
foregoing section more definite. 
Here are two bird poems. Compare them for form and 
meaning with a view to the probability of their being ap- 
preciated by children eleven and twelve years old. 
TO A SKYLARK 
Ethereal minstrel! pilgrim of the sky! 
Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound? 
Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye 
Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground? 
Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will, 
Those quivering wings composed, that music still! 
Leave to the nightingale her shady wood; 
A privacy of glorious light is thine; 
Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood 
Of harmony, with instinct more divine; 
Type of the wise who soar, but never roam; 
True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home!

THE HEIGHT OF THE RIDICULOUS 
I wrote some lines once on a time 
In wondrous merry mood, 
And thought, as usual, men would say 
They were exceeding good. 
They were so queer, so very queer, 
I laughed as I would die; 
Albeit, in the general way, 
A sober man am I. 
I called my servant, and he came; 
How kind it was of him, 
To mind a slender man like me, 
He of the mighty limb! 
“These to the printer,” I exclaimed, 
And, in my humorous way,~ 
T added (as a trifling jest), 
“There’ll be the devil to pay.” 
He took the paper, and I watched, 
And saw him peep within; 
At the first line he read, his face 
Was all upon the grin. 
He read the next; the grin grew broad, 
And shot from ear to ear; 
He read the third; a chuckling noise 
I now began to hear. 
The fourth; he broke into a roar; 
The fifth; his waistband split; 
The sixth; he burst five buttons off, 
And tumbled in a fit.

THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER 
‘The sun was shining on the sea, 
Shining with all his might; 
He did his very best to make 
The billows smooth and bright — 
And this was odd, because it was 
The middle of the night. 
The moon was shining sulkily, 
Because she thought the sun 
Had got no business to be there 
After the day was done — 
“Tt’s very rude of him,” she said, 
“To come and spoil the fun!” 
The sea was wet as wet could be, 
The sands were dry as dry. 
You could not see a cloud, because 
No cloud was in the sky; 
No birds were flying overhead — 
There were no birds to fly. 
The Walrus and the Carpenter 
Were walking close at hand; 
They wept like anything to see 
Such quantities of sand; 
“Tf this were only cleared away,” 
They said, “it would be grand!” 
“Tf seven maids with seven mops 
Swept it for half a year, 
Do you suppose,” the Walrus said, 
“That they could get it clear?” 
“T doubt it,” said the Carpenter, 
And shed a bitter tear.

“Oysters, come and walk with us!” 
The Walrus did beseech. 
“A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, 
Along the briny beach; 
We cannot do with more than four, 
To give a hand to each.” 
The eldest Oyster looked at him, 
But never a word he said; 
The eldest Oyster winked his eye, 
And shook his heavy head — 
Meaning to say he did not choose 
To leave the oyster-bed. 
But four young Oysters hurried up 
All eager for the treat; 
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, 
Their shoes were ‘clean and neat — 
And this was odd, because, you know, 
They hadn’t any feet. 
Four other Oysters followed them, 
And yet another four; 
And thick and fast they came at last, 
And more, and more, and more — 
All hopping through the frothy waves, 
And scrambling to the shore. 
The Walrus and the Carpenter 
Walked on a mile or so, 
And then they rested on a rock 
Conveniently low; 
And all the little Oysters stood 
And waited in a row. 
“The time has come,” the Walrus said, 
“To talk of many things; 
Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax — 
Of cabbages — and kings — 
And why the sea is boiling hot — 
And whether pigs have wings.”

“But wait a bit,” the Oysters cried, 
“Before we have our chat; 
For some of us are out of breath, 
And all of us are fat!” 
“No hurry!” said the Carpenter. 
They thanked him much for that. 
“A loaf of bread,” the Walrus said, 
“Ts what we chiefly need; 
Pepper and vinegar besides 
Are very good indeed — 
Now if you’re ready, Oysters dear, . 
We can begin to feed.” 
“But not on us!” the Oysters cried, 
Turning a little blue; 
“After such kindness, that would be 
A dismal thing to do!” 
“The night is fine,” the Walrus said, 
“Do you admire the view? 
“Tt was so kind of you to come! 
And you are very nice!” 
The Carpenter said nothing but 
“Cut us another slice; 
I wish you were not quite so deaf — 
I’ve had to ask you twice.” 
“Tt seems a shame,” the Walrus said,’ 
“To play them such a trick, 
After we’ve brought them out so far, 
And made them trot so quick!” 
The Carpenter said nothing but 
“The butter’s spread too thick!” 
“T weep for you,” the Walrus said; 
“T deeply sympathize.” ‘ 
With sobs and tears he sorted out 
Those of the largest size, 
Holding his pocket-handkerchief 
Before his streaming eyes. _

They’d eaten every one.

                              Appreciation and learning 
It is not difficult to sense the essential likeness and the 
essential difference between appreciation and learning. 
They are alike in this that both are self-activities. We 
cannot transfer to our pupils our likes and dislikes of persons, 
influences, pictures, poems, stories, or music. Any attempts 
of ours in this direction, if they are successful, will result only 
in insincerity and superficiality, which in fact is the same 
thing. As what one learns he must learn for himself, so 
what one appreciates he must appreciate for himself. If 
we have forty pupils, there will be forty degrees of favorable 
reaction on the different levels on which the forty personali- 
ties are alive in the field suggested by a given work of art. 
But appreciation and learning are different in that learn- 
ing is a process of building minds and of developing sensitive- 
nesses to things and influences, while appreciation is a re- 
action of our already constructed minds to what presents 
itself for our judgment and pleasure. To-day I may care 
nothing for Browning’s lines — 
Grow old along with me! 
The best is yet to be,

old in me to put into them. But to-morrow, if I have used 
my yesterdays wisely, the life meanings of all my past years 
flow into these lines, as the rays of the sun flow into a room 
when the curtain is raised. An appreciation lesson will not 
then be a learning exercise, but one of enjoyment. At these 
times we shall feel no responsibility for inducing a liking for 
the picture, the musical selection, the piece of literature. 
We shall be concerned only to provide the conditions favor- 
able for the pupils’ genuine reaction. It is a situation in 
which the individual and the work of art are alone involved. 
It is a case of lover and beloved where a third party is an 
intrusion. The pupils’ unresponsiveness to what we deem 
worthy will show their immaturity or lack of mind training. 
If the former, time alone can make good the deficiency. If 
the latter, educational opportunities should be provided, 
but not in this period. 
Our general disregard in education of the difference be- 
tween learning and appreciation, and our neglect to provide 
opportunities for appreciative contemplation, unhampered 
by. instruction and by teacher influence, may account in 
part for the low level of tastes and enjoyment of the many 
who have passed through our school courses in drawing, 
music, and literature. So many seem neither to know how 
‘to enjoy fine things in any form nor to care for them. 
But when we say that there should be times set apart for 
the pure enjoyment of art, we are not saying that our pupils 
should be shut off from the enjoyment of it at other times. 
In all learning periods — in fact, as a part of the learning 
process — appreciation has its place. As pupils are studying 
and practicing a song, how refreshing to have the teacher 
herself render it artistically, or to have a phonograph repro- 
duction. The pupils can hardly fail to sense and enjoy the 
effects that they themselves have not yet been able to pro- 
duce. In other words, appreciation is properly a phase of
-P-A-G-E-281
    SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 269 
learning, but it also has its own specific place quite inde- 
pendent of learning, and this place should be provided for 
and should be sacredly guarded. And the same idea holds 
good in studying and appreciating pictures and literature. 
Appreciating pictures 
What is there in a picture to enjoy? 
First, there is the material the artist has used and the way 
he has used it — the figures, the foreground, the background, 
the center of interest, and lines and colors, the proportions 
and perspectives. One might say that these are the exter- 
nals of a picture. If they are repelling, we are not likely to 
hold further communion with it without a conscious effort. 
But, if we continue to let our minds play with it, meaning 
suggestions arise which release memories and ideas from our 
mental storehouse. They come crowding into consciousness 
to find their places in the picture. They come and go, and 
some return to take up their abode there. Thus it acquires 
a meaning for us that is individually ours. 
And it may be that we shall find ourselves stirred by love, 
or hatred, or anger, by patriotism, by longing for heroic or 
self-sacrificing deeds, by regrets, hopes, ambitions, aspira- 
tions. These reactions are above the level of facts and their 
‘meanings. They are mental reactions on the religious level.! 
Appreciating music 
What is there in music to enjoy? 
There is the senuous medium, the sound. 
The feeling for tones is something more than mere pleasantness; 
it is also a mood. . . . These sense feelings are the subtle, but basal, 
material of all beauty. 
But tones are given us in succession. 
1 Cf. chap. v, “Drawing and Applied Art,” by Fred H. Daniels in How to 
Teach the Special Subjects, by Kendall and Mirick.  
-P-A-G-E-282
  270 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
In its time aspect, music has two chief characteristics, rhythm 
and melody. 
Music supplies us with no definite images of nature, as paint- 
ing and sculpture do, and with no ideas, as poetry does. . . . It sup- 
plies us with the feeling tones of things and events. ... It moves 
wholly in a world of pure feeling, with no embodiment save only 
sound. 
Yet — and this is the central paradox of music — despite its ab- 
stractness, nay, because of this very quality, it remains the most 
personal and intimate of the arts. For, itself offering no images of 
things and events to which we may attach the feeelings which it 
arouses, we supply ourown. We fill in the impersonal form of mu- 
sical feeling with the concrete emotions of our own lives; it is our 
strivings, our hopes and fears, which music expresses. By denying 
us access to the world about us, music compels us to turn in upon 
ourselves; it is we who live there in the sounds. For, as we have 
seen, the rhythmic tones seize hold not only of our attention but of 
our bodies also — hand and foot and head and heart — resounding 
throughout the whole organism. ... As we listen to the music, we 
shall see the things we hope for or fear or desire; or else transport 
ourselves among purely fanciful objects and events. Music is a 
language which we all understand because it expresses the basic 
mold of all emotions and striving; yet it is a language which no two 
people understand in the same way, because each pours into that 
mold his own unique experience.* 
In the foregoing Professor Parker has iaid before us what 
there is in music to enjoy. It is not the words in a song that 
are musically significant. These belong to literature and we 
appreciate them as literature apart from their musical set- 
ting. It is the sounds with their varied pitch, color, inten- 
sity, and quality, succeeding one another with rhythm and 
melody. 
We probably make too much of the words that accompany 
vocal music for our best enjoyment of it. Instrumental 
music is not thus adulterated. May we not have here an 
explanation of our often keen enjoyment of religious music

    SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 271 
in spite of the unacceptable ideas that accompany it? Do 
we not ourselves frequently sing hymns with spiritual 
refreshment and uplift, although the words we sing convey 
what to our intelligence are heathenish ideas — in fact, are 
we not at times quite unconscious of the words? So, too, 
we may enjoy an opera the more when it is sung in a lan- 
guage that we cannot at all understand, and we may to our 
musical advantage close our ears to the fragments of ideas, 
the oft-repeated word phrases that go with an oratorio. 
They are bothersome and quite unnecessary. 
But listening to music in this way and for this kind of 
enjoyment requires for most of us opportunity and direction 
as well as previous training, culture, and life’s experience. 
The opportunity should be provided in special appreciation 
periods scattered through the school year.! 
Appreciating literature 
What is there in literature to enjoy? 
We are told that “literature is the expression of life.” 
But that is just what we have seen that pictures and music 
are, so that it would seem that our enjoyment of literature 
will be not essentially different from our enjoyment of all 
other kinds of art. The stimulus to enjoyment, however, 
comes by way of words rather than by way of sounds, or 
lines, colors, forms. 
Many who have found their deepest satisfactions in litera- 
ture have written about what that enjoyment consists in 
and the conditions that make it possible. All seem to agree 
in this, that there are three kinds of enjoyment, that of 
form, of ideas, and of inspiration. 
In a previous section we have noted that the form — that 
is, the words and the ways the words are put together (the 
1 Cf. chap. m1, “Music,” by D. R. Gebhard, in How to Teach the Special 
Subjects, by Kendall and Mirick.
-P-A-G-E-284
  \ 
272 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
style) — may obscure the thought. For those who have a 
taste for words, however, there is keen enjoyment as they 
sense the quaintness, the old-fashioned word simplicity of 
the following selection with which Washington Irving brings 
to a close his essay on “The Mutability of Literature.” 
And, by the way, Irving reveals to us here, in familiar con- 
versation with “a little thick quarto” that he has found on 
the shelves of the library in Westminster Abbey, much that 
is suggestive for a teacher who wishes to lead her pupils into 
profitable appreciation of literature. But to return to the 
poem. 
Thorow earth and waters deepe, 
The pen by skill doth passe; 
And featly nyps the worldes abuse, 
And shoes us in a glasse 
The vertu and the vice 
Of every wight alives 
The honey-comb that bee doth make 
Is not so sweet in hyve, 
As are the golden leves 
That drop from poet’s head! 
Which doth surmount our common talke 
As far as dross doth lead. 
Not many of our children seem to have a taste for words 
and style, either because of temperament or because they 
have had little chance to cultivate it. It must be admitted 
that in schools little attention is paid to it, although a 
genuine interest in words is fundamental in the writing of 
good compositions. 
There is more general interest in ideas than in the forms 
by which they are suggested, but, as in the case of pictures 
and music, our pupils will enjoy meanings in the degree and 
in that variety to which meanings have already been built 
into their minds. 
Even the simplest beoks, such as these about nature, require that
-P-A-G-E-285
  
  SELF-EDUCATION AND APPRECIATION 278 
there should have been in the reader some previous life, some train- 
ing of the eye, some curiosity about birds and beasts and the treas- 
ure-trove of the sea beach. The having lived is the essential condi- 
tion of any appreciation of literature, the appeal to experience lies 
back of all literary pleasure.! 
And, as in the case of the other arts, there is that third 
kind of enjoyment of literature that comes with the con- 
sciousness of spiritual expansion, and this in their childish 
way our pupils may share with the most mature. 
The reader cannot transcend at the moment his own season; as a 
child he reads as a child, and asamanasaman. A boy of ten may 
read Homer, but he reads it with the power of a boy of ten. Itisa 
child’s Homer. The dependence of the book on the reader being so 
strict, it is always advisable to keep literary study on a near level 
with life as it is in the individual case.? 
And this is particularly true of the selections read by the 
teacher or pupils in the period given to appreciation. For 
the largest and richest enjoyment these selections should be 
of relatively familiar vocabulary, direct and simple style, 
and on a level with their probable experience and spiritual 
development. 
In looking at our nature, we discover, among its admirable 
endowments, the sense or perception of beauty. We see the germ 
of this in every human being, and there is no power which admits 
greater cultivation; and why should it not be cherished in all? * 
Summary of Chapter XIII 
1. Appreciation is consciousness of values and enjoyment 
in that consciousness. 
2. The old saying, “You can judge a person by what he 
likes,” is true, because one likes what he himself is. 
8. The conception of the artist, the composer, the author, 
1 George E. Woodberry, The Appreciation of Literature.

-P-A-G-E-286
    274 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
may be unknown, but we may yet value the production and 
enjoy it because we endow it with our own ideas and concep- 
tions. 
It is in thy power to think as thou wilt. The essence of things is 
in thy thoughts about them.! 
4, Whether or not we enjoy the lines and colors of a pic- 
ture, the tones, rhythm, and melody of a song, the discrim- 
inating use of words, and the balanced, symmetrical struc- 
ture of a literary selection depends entirely upon our mental 
development in these fields. Likewise our enjoyment of the 
meanings of works of art depends upon the variety and full- 
ness of meanings of our own ideas. And a work of art will 
have no inspiration for us except as we have experienced in 
our own mental life the aspirations, hopes, or fears that can 
respond to its suggestions. 
5. The preparation for appreciations is made by the life 
we live in and out of school. To give wise direction in a 
school life in which conditions are favorable for varied self- 
education in conduct and study is to give the best assistance 
a teacher can give for the pupils’ progressive enjoyment of 
beauty in all forms. 
6. While it is true that appreciation is an integral part of 
the process of learning, it is also true that it has its place 
apart. Therefore, perhaps not frequently but occasionally, 
pupils should have opportunities for pure enjoyment un- 
alloyed by instruction. They should learn how to put them- 
selves into different forms of beauty, how to surrender them- 
selves, sense, understanding, imagination, to a work of art.

  CHAPTER XIV 
EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND THE TEACHER 
“Ts the scientific measurement of education by the applica- 
tion of scientifically determined standards a matter that 
should concern me and my school?” is a question often asked 
nowadays by thoughtful teachers. The following discussion 
is intended as an answer to this question. 
Teachers have always measured the work of their pupils 
Like most if not all of the so-called new things in education, 
scientific educational standards and the scientific measure- 
ment of educational products by the use of scientifically 
determined units of value under standardized conditions 
have had their beginnings in the unscientific practices of 
school teachers in the past. Teachers have always measured 
their pupils’ work, placing this one at the head of the class 
and that one at the foot; giving this one ninety per cent and 
that one sixty per cent; promoting this pupil because his 
work was “passable,” and retarding that one because his 
work was a failure. 
It isevident that, whenever a teacher thus passes judgment 
on her pupils, she is in reality “measuring” the amount and 
quality of their school work or their ability, in most cases 
both. 
But measuring and judging requires a standard. If one 
measures cloth, one must use an agreed-on standard of 
length — a yard, for instance. If one measures wood, one 
must use the cord as the standard, or the board-foot. If one 
judges that this lead pencil is hard while another is soft, or 
that this house is large and that small, it is because there is in
-P-A-G-E-288
276 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
the mind a standard (possibly an indefinite one) from which 
the lead pencils and the houses vary. 
Bases of measurement are either changeable and indefinite 
or they are standardized. The writer can remember when 
it was not uncommon to measure cloth by stretching it 
from the tip of the nose to the tip of the fingers stretched as 
far as they could be horizontally from the side of the body. 
Between nose and finger-tips was a yard. It is still common 
practice to measure distances by “pacing,” one “pace” 
being reckoned as a yard. But such measurements are, of 
course, inaccurate, a yard depending on the length of one’s 
arm or upon the length of one’s stride. In all matters that 
involve much value every one insists upon using standard 
units of measurement. 
As we look back over the history of education, it seems 
strange that not until the twentieth century did it occur 
to any except a very few people that it was either desirable 
or possible to measure the work of the schoolroom by the 
use of “standardized” units of measurement. Those who 
first proposed such a thing were ignored or ridiculed. But 
when there arises a consciousness of the value of anything, 
then standards of value are set up and used in measuring it, 
as in the case of silver, gold, and diamonds. 
And so it happened in the case of children. When the 
world realized that they were the Nation’s wealth, far above 
the value of precious metals and costly stones, then the 
proposition to reduce waste in their education by physical 
and mental measurements of a sort that were more exact 
than guesses was taken seriously, and the movement for 
scientific standards and scientific measurements in education 
began in earnest. 
Scientific measurements in education 
At this point many will say, “Yes, it is quite evident that
-P-A-G-E-289
  EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 277 
it would be better to measure children’s abilities and their 
attainments in school by agreed-on standards as uniform as 
a foot-rule and a pound-weight, but is it possible to do it? 
Are not the mental abilities of human beings and their 
thoughts immaterial things, so unlike cloth, and wood, 
and gold, that no such measurements can be applied to 
them?” 
It is true that up to very recent times it was believed that 
human abilities and educational products could not be 
measured. But that is exactly what is now being done. 
Already marvelous results have been attained and there is 
promise of yet more marvelous results in the future. 
A brief word as to the nature of these measurements will 
help one to see that there is really nothing mysterious about 
them. 
In the first place, it may be noted that mental abilities are 
not measured directly, but indirectly. To understand what 
this means, let us illustrate by the way wind, and electricity, 
and the power of machines are measured. When one says, 
“The wind is blowing thirty miles an hour,” there is no 
intention of implying that any one has ever been able to 
get hold of the wind and measure it as one does a piece of 
cloth. Not that, but, as we know, some one devised a 
machine which was worked by the wind. The work that 
the wind was thus made to do — the revolving of a wheel — 
shows how “strong” the wind is. Then, by applying scien- 
tifically determined standards, the mile and the hour, it is 
possible to determine just how fast it is blowing — so many 
miles an hour. Likewise the electrician does not measure 
electricity itself, that is, directly, but he measures the work 
that an electric current does. If the current can create a 
large, brilliant light, or if it can move powerful machinery, 
the electrician knows that the current is strong and he can 
determine just how strong by applying agreed-on standards 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
    278 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
of measurement to the work performed. Again the power 
of a machine is determined in 4 similar manner by measur- 
ing the amount of work it can do, and this amount can be 
stated in what are called foot-pounds or horse-power. 
It is in this indirect way that mental abilities are measured. 
A human being is.‘a machine. This machine is moved by 
nervous energy. No one can get hold of this energy, but, 
as in the case of an electric or a steam machine, the quantity 
of the human energy and the quality of the human machine 
can be perceived by the quantity and quality of the work 
that it does. Or, to put it in another way, we must measure 
the abilities of children by measuring their activities. It 
only remains to agree on standards of measurement in order 
to be able to state with accuracy that this boy or that girl is 
of a certain grade of intelligence, and that they possess this 
or that degree of ability in arithmetic, reading, spelling, 
penmanship, etc. When the tasks that children are set to 
do are arranged in a series according to the degree of difficulty 
that the doing of them involves, there results a “scale.” 
Already “scales” of general ability, of arithmetic abilities, of 
penmanship abilities, of reading abilities, of composition 
abilities, have been devised, and others are being made by 
specialists who are working in this department of educa- 
tion. 
It will be admitted that no one of these “scales” is yet so 
far perfected that it can be used with the certainty with 
which a foot-rule and a yardstick are used. It would be 
surprising, indeed, if final, generally agreed-on standards of 
mental measurements had been devised in the short period 
of ten years during which students have been at work on 
them. But such as they are, tentative, incomplete, many 
of them crude, they have brought, nevertheless, great 
blessings to the schools.

EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 279 
Some results from the use of educational measurements 
To make it clear that scientific educational standards 
and measurements should not be discredited because they 
cannot be used as easily and as effectively as a quart measure, 
astatement of some of the benefits that have come from their 
use follows. 
1. By the use of “general intelligence tests” mentally 
defective children have been identified and by thou- 
sands have been removed from the regular school to 
schools especially devised for their care and train- 
ing. 
2. In high schools and colleges “general intelligence 
tests” are being applied to discover the abilities of 
students. The results of these tests are used by the 
school authorities as aids to understanding the students. 
They are also used by the students themselves as 
guides in selecting courses of study. All teachers will 
welcome the help that such tests will give when they 
are perfected. Already in many cases the tests have 
shown that an unsuccessful student has plenty of 
ability, but islazy. This was suspected before, but the 
“tests” confirm the suspicion. Many natural leaders, 
who have been merely stalling, have had their own 
abilities revealed to them. They have been placed 
ahead in the school system where they have found 
themselves and opportunities for the exercise of their 
latent powers. Again the tests have shown that the 
unsuccessful student has not the ability to do the 
assigned tasks. He is doing as well as he can. When 
this is known as a fact, this student’s problem is sim- 
plified for him and for the teacher. 
8. By trying out various tentative standards with thou- 
sands of children, there is being established a body of
-P-A-G-E-292
280 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
facts regarding what ought to be expected of children 
in quantity, quality, and rapidity of performance in 
each subject of study and in each grade. Already these 
facts have been influential in changing courses of study 
in spelling, in handwriting, and in arithmetic. 
. Standard tests and measurements have shown that the 
tasks we formerly thought were quite simple, such as 
spelling a word, adding numbers, and reading, are in 
fact very complex. This knowledge, when it is more 
nearly complete and when it is formulated into “laws” 
of teaching, will be of immense help to teachers. 
. By these tests a teacher learns much about the special 
difficulties of her pupils in different subjects. In the 
light of this knowledge she may give special help to 
individuals and groups. 
. When a standard has been established, for example, in 
fifth-grade handwriting, a teacher in this grade not 
only has a sure basis on which to judge the performance 
of her pupils, but the performance of her school as a 
whole can be compared with that of other fifth grades 
in her town, and the performance of all the fifth-grade 
schools of the town can be compared with similar 
performances in other towns and cities. But in making 
the comparisons the precaution should always be 
taken to supplement subject tests by intelligence tests 
in order to show how the schools tested compare in 
intelligence or capacity. 
. Teachers and others interested in education are coming 
to see that children’s success in school is determined 
primarily by the tasks that are set for them todo. The 
determination of what they should learn, the degree of 
skill they should acquire is limited by their abilities. 
These are more correctly judged by comparison with 
the work of large groups of children than they are by
-P-A-G-E-293

EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 281 
referring to the opinions, the theoretical “say-so,” of 
older people. 
The teacher’s relation to educational measurements 
Education has often been compared with the practice of 
medicine. Some light is thrown on the teacher’s place in this 
new educational movement by reference to the medical 
profession. 
In medicine there are “original investigators” — that is, 
people who devote themselves to research; there are 
“specialists”; and there are “general practitioners.” 
“Original investigators” discover and formulate new truth. 
“Specialists” by special training in a limited field are able 
to use the finest medical tools in a highly technical way. 
The “general practitioner” uses the results of the studies of 
“investigators” as standards of judgment and as guides in 
his practice, but he does not attempt to use the refined tools 
or the elaborate technical methods of the “specialist.” 
In education there has developed a similar situation. 
Groups of advanced students are making investigations and 
experiments from which are being formulated standards, 
and methods of applying these standards, in educational 
measurements. These investigators are also in charge of 
the educational measurements carried on as a part of so- 
called “school surveys” of State, County, City, and Town 
systems. 
The “specialist” in educational measurement has already 
made his distinctive place. In an increasing number of 
cities he is employed as a part of the administrative de- 
partment. His duties are to apply “standards” rather than 
to invent them, and to study the results of the “measure- 
ments” with school officers and teachers with a view to 
bettering school practices. Doubtless in time such a 
“specialist” will be a member of the faculty of every large 
 
-P-A-G-E-294
Fe er eee aE ete er roe eee er wig eeepe ep Pees a mae 
282 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Superintendents and supervisors are what may be called 
“general practitioners” in this field. They should be com- 
petent, by reason of some special study and training, to 
employ scientific tests in the schools for which they are 
responsible. They are doing this in increasing numbers 
with large and vital results for teachers and pupils. How- 
ever, it is not to be expected that they will be able to use 
them with the refinement, elaboration, and exactness of the 
“specialist.” 
But has the teacher any place or responsibility in this new 
movement? There can be but one answer. Her place is a 
large one and her responsibility is clear. The teacher who is 
to be useful in the schools of to-day and of to-morrow will 
be intelligent regarding this movement. She will under- 
stand the purpose of educational standards and measure- 
ments. She will know in a general way how standards and 
scales are made and how they are used. She will be able to 
codperate intelligently with supervisors and specialists when 
measurements are made in her room. She will be able to 
interpret the returns that come to her showing the ratings 
of her pupils. She will understand that the tests are in- 
tended to aid her. They are not for the purpose of fur- 
nishing material by which she, the teacher, may be judged 
by her supervisor. 
The foregoing statement regarding the teacher’s responsi- 
bility implies a limit beyond which she is not responsible. 
Neither she nor any one else without training should attempt 
to apply the highly complex scales in the technical ways used 
by the “specialist.” To do this requires special study and 
controlled practice. In all cases that involve the vital in- 
terests of pupils, trained judgment in “diagnosis” is required 
and a period of “probation” for the pupil affected, so that 
the correctness of the diagnosis may be confirmed or dis- high school, and he will ra his place in rural districts also. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 283 
proved. Unless the results of scientific measurements are 
correctly interpreted, they may do more harm than good. 
In this connection it may be noted that each pupil’s per- 
formance in his various tests constitutes a record which he 
should undertake to beat, not another’s record, nor that of 
the class, but his own. 
And now a brief word regarding some of the “standards” 
and “scales” that have been devised for measuring the work 
of school children in the different subjects of study. 
HANDWRITING 
In former times the standard of school handwriting was 
beauty. To-day the standard is legibility, smoothness, and 
speed in performance. 
Professor C. T. Gray, of the University of Texas, nas 
pointed out nine qualities to which attention should be 
given: (1) heaviness of line; (2) slant; (3) size; (4) align- 
ment; (5) spacing of lines; (6) spacing of words; (7) spacing 
of letters; (8) neatness; (9) formation of letters. 
These qualities Professor Gray has arranged in a table or 
schedule form and has assigned a standard value on the 
basis of one hundred per cent perfect score. In the follow- 
ing table the figures in parentheses represent the highest 
per cent allowed for each quality:

Standard and other scales 
It is apparent that one needs a standard copy with which 
to compare a given piece of writing in order to use this 
schedule. One may, of course, use one’s own judgment or 
one may use the copy-book, but it is better to have one of 
the standard scales. It is not very important which of the 
several scales a teacher does use, as her interest is in improv- 
ing the writing of her pupils rather than in giving their work 
an exact rating. For this purpose the so-called Gettysburg 
Edition Handwriting Scale, devised by Leonard P. Ayres, is 
recommended. It can be had by sending to the Russell Sage 
Foundation, New York City. Its cost is five cents. Another 
very practical scale is that devised by Professor F. N. Free-
-P-A-G-E-297
    EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 285 
man, of Chicago University, and sold by Houghton Mifflin 
Company of Boston, Massachusetts, for twenty-five cents. 
It takes into account five qualities, and directions are given 
for rating them. Perhaps the best scale for practical use is 
one made up of specimens of the handwriting of pupils in a 
school test, arranged by comparison with the Ayres Gettys- 
burg Scale. 
The foregoing are scales of adult handwriting arranged in 
order of excellence. The Director of Penmanship of the 
Boston public schools has arranged a series of scales by 
grades. There are samples of pupils’ writing for each ten 
weeks of the eight elementary-school years with standard 
ratings that are easily used by pupils in judging their own 
writing. Houghton Mifflin Company are the publishers. 
But it is perfectly feasible for pupils to use the “copies” 
in their copy-books as standards with which to compare 
their own writing if no other standards are at hand, and 
thus to rate the different qualities of their writing by the use 
of the Gray Schedule of Rating previously given. For 
convenience this schedule may be put on the blackboard. 
But it is desirable to have one or more standard scales on a 
study table where they are accessible to pupils for reference. 
Again a teacher may wish to emphasize one quality at a 
time. In this case one hundred per cent may be used as the 
perfect score for each quality. If a pupil finds that in 
“spacing of, letters” his writing is fifty per cent uniform 
when compared with the copy-book sample or the “standard 
scale,” his work is “cut out” for him in the matter of letter 
spacing. It is also very easy to find the class average’ for any

quality. Those below the class average will then work to 
reach it, and those above will work to raise it. It is a 
stimulating exercise to have pupils rate one another’s writ- 
ing, but this will be better done if one quality is considered 
ata time. However, during practice it is wiser for them to 
have in mind only the scale and their own writing, for their 
ambition should not be to write as well as some one else, 
but to raise the quality of their own writing from one grade 
to the next. 
Measuring speed in handwriting 
Up to this point form of handwriting has been considered. 
However, speed is scarcely less important than form. A 
teacher may test the speed of her pupils’ writing in the fol- 
lowing manner: 
The class may memorize one or two simple sentences. 
When they have learned them thoroughly, let them write 
them as many times as they can in three minutes at the rate 
they ordinarily write in their regular work — not their 
penmanship lessons. At the end of three minutes, let each 
pupil count the number of words he has written and divide 
by three. This will give the average number of words he has 
written per minute. 
It is now interesting to find out how these scores compare 
with a “standard score” for speed. The class may make 
its own standard score by taking the average score made by 
pupils in each grade. But the question, “Do we write too 
fast or not fast enough?” is important. The following table 
gives the approximate standard rates determined by tests 
with many thousand children. Note that the figures in the 
table represent the number of letters, not words, written 
per minute. Letters are more accurate units of measure- 
ment than words are.

  This speed scale does not mean that all pupils should be 
trained to write at these rates. Some will and should write 
faster, and others will and should write more slowly. On 
the other hand, the scale constitutes a series of guide-posts 
that teachers and pupils should not neglect in the process of 
improving handwriting. 
SPELLING 
Spelling ability cannot be measured by scales 
The most commonly used “spelling scale” is that devised 
by Leonard P. Ayres. It is supplied by the Russell Sage 
Foundation of New York City at the price of five cents. 
The fact is that even this one scale is not of great value as a 
test of spelling ability. Spelling, so it would seem, must be 
tested in other ways than by scales, for each word is a spelling 
problem by itself and must be mastered individually. There 
are no “general spelling abilities” that may be trained, as 
there are handwriting abilities. So that a test of spelling 
must be a test of ability to spell separate words. 
It is very evident, then, that the first and most fundamen- 
tal task of the scientific student of spelling is to find out 
what words children in each grade should know how to 
spell. This task has not yet been performed to the satis- 
1 These grade standards are recommended by Harry Houston, Super- 
visor of Penmanship, New Haven, Connecticut. See “A Six-Year Pen- 
manship Course”; in Elementary School Journal, June, 1922.

  288 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
faction of every one, and students are still at work on it. 
- But considerable progress has been made. The number of 
words that should be studied for spelling in the elementary 
grades is now reduced to about three thousand. Of this 
number the one thousand most difficult have been identified, 
and of this one thousand the one hundred most troublesome 
have been discovered and listed as “Spelling Demons.” 
Tests in spelling 
The best way for a teacher to test her class in spelling is 
to dictate fifty words selected at random from those that have 
been studied during a given period. Each word should be 
put into a sentence and then pronounced separately; as, 
Yellow is the name of a color. 
yellow 
If the words from which these fifty have been selected are all 
words that have been assigned to the grade by scientific 
studies of children’s actual writing vocabularies, and if they 
have been well taught, studied, and reviewed, the teachers 
may expect a score of one hundred per cent. In the upper 
grades the test may consist of seventy-five or one hundred 
words. Statisticians tell us that such a test of fifty to one 
hundred selected words is as valid an indication of ability to 
spell all the words that have been studied as the writing of 
the entire list would be. 
These scientific studies of spelling ability show quite 
conclusively that pupils will write a list of words from dic- 
tation as described above with greater accuracy than they 
will when they are using the words in composition. Teachers 
must expect a variable degree of accuracy in spelling. The 
same pupil is not consistent in his spelling. Children are 
imperfect human machines, like their teachers, principals, 
and superintendents.

Scales for measuring different elements in reading 
In the year 1919 was published the report of a survey of 
the Gary Public Schools. In the volume entitled Measure- 
ment of Classrooom Products, Dr. S. A. Courtis thus sum- 
marizes the results of the use of scientific standard tests in 
reading: ! 
Ability in reading may mean: 
(1) Ability to recognize silently the general meaning of words of 
a given range of difficulty. (Tested by the Otis Reading 
Scale.) 
(2) Ability to “sound” correctly a given set of words. (Tested 
by the Jones Scale.) 
(8) Ability to read aloud smoothly and with proper expression, 
without regard to whether the meaning is understood or not. 
(Tested by the Gray Scale.) 
(4) Ability to read either silently or orally and to understand the 
essential relations existing between the essential elements 
of what is read. (Tested by the Courtis Scale.) 
(5) Ability to read either silently or orally and tell in one’s own 
words the substance of what has been read. (Tested by the 
Starch, Brown and Gray Scales.) 
(6) Ability to read instructions either silently or orally and be 
able to act in accordance with the instructions. (Tested by 
the Kelley Scale.) 
(7 Ability to read again and again (study) until one has mas- 
tered the contents of a passage so that one can answer ques- 
tions about it or use the information in solving problems. 
(Tested by the Thorndike Scale.) 
(8) Ability to read a passage and interpret the allusions which it 
contains. (No scale yet devised for testing.) 
(9) Ability to read a selection and be stirred emotionally by its 
esthetic elements. (No scale yet devised for testing.) 
(10) Ability to read a passage and interpret the mood, ideas or 
ideals of the author. (No scale yet devised for testing.) 
(11) Ability to read a selection and make judgments as to its

  290 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
style and merits as a piece of “Good English.” (No scale 
yet devised for testing.) 
After enumerating the above reading abilities, Dr. Courtis 
proceeds to say: 
And there are doubtless many other possible variations of the 
senses in which “ability to read” may be understood. 
Unfortunately, the makers of tests have not given much attention 
to this phase of the subject. They have labeled their productions 
“Tests of Reading”’; and have been content to say explicitly or to 
imply that by reading ability is meant the ability to complete this 
test successfully. But when several such tests are given to the same 
children, as at Gary, one would seem to have the right to expect 
that the reading abilities as revealed by one test will show some 
agreement with the reading abilities revealed by the next test, since 
both are reading tests. This, however, is precisely what the results 
in general do not show. 
Some conclusions drawn from scientific tests 
The conclusion that must be drawn from the foregoing 
and from the testimony of other investigators is that there 
are no reading scales at present that a teacher is justified in 
using by herself for the general purpose of testing reading. 
Up to the present time more than thirty reading scales have 
been devised and others are being worked out. Supervisors 
and superintendents, who have been trained in their use, 
can throw much light on the reading problem of the schools 
under their charge by applying any one of the approved 
scales. The results of such measurements, if they are made 
in the right spirit, will reveal most important suggestions for 
the improvement of teaching. 
But it should not be concluded that the scientific study of 
reading has been of no value to teachers just because the 
scales or tests now available give uncertain results. This is 
far from true. Perhaps the most important contribution 
that this study has made is the proof that “reading” is a
-P-A-G-E-303
  
EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 291 
much more complex operation than any one had thought, 
that it consists of doing a number of specific things, each 
different from the other, and that each different kind of 
work requires a specific ability and a specific training in 
order to develop skill in doing it. 
For instance these tests have made it quite clear 
a. That it is not possible to develop ability in silent reading 
by means of oral reading. Silent reading is a different 
kind of mental work from oral reading and it calls for 
the exercise of different abilities. : 
b. That understanding of what is read, does not automat- 
ically come from or develop along with either silent or 
oral reading. For the development of ability to readily 
understand what one reads special training directed to 
this end is necessary. 
c. That pupils may be able to pronounce words whose 
meaning is lacking or is very limited, and, on the other 
hand, that they may possess a body of ideas, a wealth of 
“experience,” which they have no words to express or 
through which to understand another’s expression. 
It thus becomes the teacher’s problem to keep a 
balance between these two elements of composition 
and reading, namely pronunciation of words and mean- 
ing of words. 
d. That the rate of reading has a relation to “understand- 
ing.” It seems to be clear that teachers should train 
pupils to read (silently) with a speed that will hold their 
attention closely and carry them over non-essentials 
to a ready grasp of the total idea and its important 
divisions. 
Testing reading without scales 
If she desires to know how her pupils compare one with 
another in their ability to read orally, let her select a story  
-P-A-G-E-304
  292 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
of medium and uniform difficulty of the preceding grade. 
Let her divide this selection into thought units, if possible of 
approximately the same length. Then allow all the class to 
read through the selection silently and discuss its meaning. 
Next allow each pupil to read a “thought-unit” without dis- 
cussion. The factors to be rated are (1) clearness of ut- 
terance, (2) correct pronunciation, (3) intelligent expression 
(or interpretation). 
If the teacher wishes to test the pupil’s relative ability in 
understanding, let her select as noted above a passage from 
the previous grade reader of medium difficulty in vocabulary 
and thought, long enough to require three minutes in the 
reading. After the pupils have read this selection silently, 
let them answer in writing some questions that will test their 
understanding of what is read. Four or five questions are 
enough for this purpose. If five questions are asked, those 
who answer all of them correctly may be rated A. Those 
who answer four correctly may be rated B, etc., to E. 
For a test in rate of reading the teachers may again select 
in a reader of the previous grade an interesting selection 
that has no verbal difficulties for the class. 
1. Tell the class that you want to find out how rapidly 
each reads when he reads to himself. 
2. Explain how you are going to do it. 
8. Have the books passed to the class. 
4. When each one has a book and is attentive, let the 
books be opened to the right page and be placed on the 
desk open side down. 
5. At asignal the class take books and read for two minutes 
to give a good start, each marking with a caret (V) 
the point where he stops. At another signal they begin 
reading and are stopped at the end of another minute, 
when they make another caret (V). 
6. Let the class now go on and finish the story.
-P-A-G-E-305
  EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 293 
7. After the story is finished, let each one count the num- 
ber of words read between the two carets. This will be 
a rough indication of their rates of reading, and the 
teacher can record them on a slip of paper prepared 
for this purpose. 
Such a test of rate of reading is not scientific and it is not 
exact. However it willreveal the rapid readers, the medium, 
and the slow readers, and this is one of the very important 
revelations that the most scientific of scientific tests would 
make. 
After such a test teacher and pupils could scarcely fail to 
be interested in comparing this rate of reading with the rates 
made by pupils of the same grade elsewhere. It will not be 
possible to establish a “standard” rate until it has been 
determined just how easy or difficult the testing selections 
should be. This has not yet been determined. Moreover 
the methods of conducting the tests have not yet been agreed 
on, nor the methods of computing results. But the rates 
given below are about midway between the extremes of 
slow and rapid reading rates that have been recorded by 
different investigators. They are taken from Professor 
Gray’s report.

  Readers are now being published that suggest methods of 
training in silent reading and in the study of reading for ap- 
preciation, and also methods for testing and for developing 
speed. Teachers will find a set of such readers and the ac- 
companying manual most useful additions to their working 
libraries even if the books are not provided for their pupils.

ComposiITION 
What is involved in judging a composition 
Perhaps there has been more controversy over the various 
attempts to measure compositions than there has been over 
the attempts to measure any other educational product. 
From these controversies have emerged a few clear conclu- 
sions. Among them are the following: 
1. It is possible to measure the quality of a composition in 
an impersonal way, and with scientific exactness, al- 
though one must have a good deal of training and expe- 
rience before he can do it. 
2. There are two distinctly different questions that it is de- 
sirable to answer regarding the quality of a composition. 
a. What is its absolute value? 
That is, what is its quality when compared with 
a series of compositions arranged according to a regu- 
larly ascending scale of quality that has been scien- 
tifically determined, irrespective of the age or train- 
ing of the writer? 
b. What is its relative quality ? 
That is, what is its quality when compared with 
compositions written by pupils of the same grade; 
when compared with the work of members of the 
same class; when compared with the writer’s previous 
work? 
8. There are a number of distinctly different qualities that 
combine to make a composition good or bad, namely, 
punctuation, spelling, organization, style, interest, sub- 
stance, etc. In rating a composition each of these 
qualities should be given consideration in accordance 
with a predetermined scale of rating. Such a scale of 
ratings has been worked out in connection with the 
Hillegas Scale.  
-P-A-G-E-307

| EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 295 
The Hillegas Composition Scale 
The first serious attempt to establish composition stand- 
ards was made by Professor Hillegas, of Teachers College, 
Columbia University. His work resulted in the so-called 
Hillegas Composition Scale. It consists of ten compositions 
arranged in order of merit. The first composition is non- 
sense. The last is a well organized, thoughtful composition 
with literary merit. 
These compositions were selected and arranged with such 
care that no one questions that together they constitute a 
“scientific scale” of composition values. It is generally con- 
sidered the best for use in determining the absolute value of 
a composition. 
But Dr. Courtis in his report on the survey of the Gary 
schools states that “It must be admitted at once that this 
scale cannot be used effectively without training.” It is not 
referred to here therefore in order to recommend it for teach- 
ers’ use, but because when it is interpreted, it reveals to 
them a scale of values or ratings of composition qualities 
that they will find helpful. 
Dr. Courtis has made this interpretation. It will be found 
on page 245 of his report on the Gary Public Schools — 
Measurement of Classroom Products. He labels it   Awnatysis or THE Hittrcas Composition Scauz 4

C. Literary Merit (Interesting to read) 
Interesting material marred by imperfect use of 
words 70-79 
Well selected material expressed in well chosen 
words 80-89 
Exceptional content and quality 90-99 
Note: This analysis should be read as follows: 
If a composition because of its gross errors in mechanics proves 
difficult to read and understand, it falls in the first division of the 
scale (0-30). Ifthe meaning is not clear after repeated attempts to 
decipher the composition, the value assigned it should be between 
0 and 9 points, depending on the amount that can be read. If the 
meaning is decipherable, but with difficulty, its quality should be 
rated from 10 to 19 points, and so on. 
With the foregoing as a basis of judgment, a teacher may 
rate a given composition much more accurately than she can 
by the variable standard of her own experience, even though 
she does not attempt to apply the refinements of rating em- 
ployed by the “specialist.” 
Grade scales 
The foregoing indicates how a teacher may use a composi- 
tion scale to help her judge the absolute value of a composi- 
tion. But, as noted before, it is a matter of equal import- 
ance, perhaps of greater importance, to determine the value 
of a composition as a Third, Fourth, or other grade produc- 
tion. Scales for this purpose have been devised. Professor 
Hosic ! proposed one in the Seventeenth Year-Book of the 
National Society for the Study of Education, Part I. For 
lack of space only the composition rated E (Excellent) in 
each grade is reproduced here. These compositions have 
been carefully rated by teachers in the Parker Practice

School, Chicago Normal College. Teachers are justified in 
using them as a basis of judgment in rating pupils in their 
own schools.

thought the horse was hungry and I let him eat, but when I went to 
pull him away he would not let me. I pulled so hard that I lost the 
reins and had to get down although I did not know how to get on 
the horse again. I got the reins over the horse’s head, and pulled 
him up by the fence. He would not stand still long enough for me 
to get on his back. After a while I got tired of standing there so I 
pulled him up again and got him to eating. While he was eating I

An Incident on Horseback 
About two years ago this summer I was on a farm in New York 
State. It was near the village of Jay. The people we were staying 
with kept a boarding house as well as a farm. 
They had six horses, two buggy horses and four truck horses. I 
rode horseback on the smallest buggy horse. One day when I was | 
horseback riding the dog (which belonged to the lady with whom 
we were staying) began to snap and bark at the horse. This got 
him nervous so in order not to be thrown I steered him around in a 
circle. The dog sat in the middle looking at us every minute but 
before long he got so dizzy that he could not get up. I thought we 
could get away before he recovered but I was entirely mistaken for 
when I pulled on the other rein the horse would not turn. He kept 
on in a circle until the hired man who happened to be in the yard 
came and took the dog away. I then stopped the horse. | 
You may be sure I did not ride around the dogs again.

My First Ride on the Street Car Alone 
My most exciting experience was my first ride on the street car 
alone. Iwas nine years old and I was going to see one of my girl 
friends who lived on Sixty-fifth and Kimbark Avenue. I was going 
to take my doll with me and I had a great deal of trouble getting it 
dressed just so. It was at the time when they had open cars in the 
summer. I could find no place to sit but up in front with the motor- 
man. When the conductor came up to collect my fare he said, 
“Well, who is this?” I did not answer him at first until he asked
-P-A-G-E-311
  EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 299 
me what my name was. Then he saw my doll and said, “Oh! you 
have a baby with you. Well I guess I’ll have to charge you extra 
for it.” Iwas beginning to get frightened at that but to change the 
subject I told him to let me off at Kimbark Avenue. The motor- 
man turned around and said, “‘I will take care of her but you had 
better go and finish collecting your fares.” After the conductor 
was gone the motorman started to talk to me in spite of the sign 
above his head which said, “‘“Motormen must not talk to passen- 
gers.” He asked me where I was going and if my doll was ever sick. 
Every once in a while he turned around and said, “I think I hear 
your doll crying.” 
I was glad when we came to Kimbark Avenue because I did not 
like to have everybody asking me questions. When the conductor 
lifted me off the car I found my friend waiting for me. When I told 
her what had happened in the car she laughed and I could not imag- 
ine why.

Breaking a Door Glass 
Young as I was, I was very fond of marbles, especially those 
brown, hard ones that were six for a cent. I was always using 
them when I should have put them away. It was one Binday, 
when I was told to put them away, that I disobeyed, and took them 
with me to a friend’s house. 
It was great sport, throwing my marbles against the stone stairs 
and catching them as they bounced back to me. But my fun was 
soon spoiled by a marble which went too high and broke the large, 
engraved, plate glass door that led from the porch into the house. 
My mother was summoned and I was told, in fact I knew very well, 
what would happen when I got home. As I was very small I threw 
the marble into a sewer thinking that would help matters but it 
did not. This combination of pleasure and misfortune cost my 
father thirteen dollars and a half.

Scale given on a previous page a teacher may rate the composi-

Classroom composition scales 
Teachers and pupils may make composition scales for 
themselves. These will not have the scientific exactness of 
those made by specialists, but they will serve an immediate 
and important purpose. 
A teacher may select five to ten different compositions — 
short paragraphs are best for this purpose — and mount 
them on a long piece of cardboard in the order of excellence 
as she judges them by reference to the relative values of 
qualities found in Dr. Courtis’s analysis of the Hillegas Scale 
given on a previous page. The pupils can compare para- 
graphs of their own with this scale as they compare their 
handwriting with the handwriting scale. 
It is also a profitable exercise for pupils to take a small 
number of paragraphs written by their classmates and ar- 
range them in a series according to quality. This will train 
their critical sense. Five paragraphs for this use are better 
than a larger number. 
Again, each pupil may write five paragraphs on the same 
subject with the purpose of putting into each successive one 
a finer quality of mechanical excellence, of organization, or of 
literary merit so that they can be made into a “scale.” 
ARITHMETIC 
Need of arithmetic standards 
With the narrowing of the field of school arithmetic has 
come a demand for greater skill on the part of pupils. Now, 
skill involves not only an understanding of what is done, and 
accuracy in doing it, but it involves, too, a certain standard 
of speed. Stenographers and typewriters find out very 
quickly that they may be absolutely accurate in their work, 
but that they cannot hold their positions unless they can turn 
off a satisfactory amount of work in a given time. The time
-P-A-G-E-313
  EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 301 
or speed element enters into all the business of modern life. 
The use of arithmetic is no exception to this rule. 
There are, then, two fundamentally important ques- 
tions that teachers of arithmetic need to have answered for 
them. : 
1. How accurate should we expect pupils to become in cal- 
culation and in problem-solving? 
2. How rapidly should they work? 
No process of guessing, estimating, or “thinking” will 
produce satisfactory answers to these questions. The an- 
swers must be found by wide and laborious investigations 
from which “standards” of accuracy and of speed may be 
derived. Some tentative standards of this sort have been 
found, but to use them as a basis of comparison with the 
work of any one school requires special training. 
Although the untrained teacher is not advised to apply 
scientific measurements in her school without the assistance 
of one who has had special training in their use, she is not, 
for that reason, without responsibility to definitely strive to 
improve the arithmetical skill of her pupils in accuracy and 
speed up to a desirable point. 
This desirable point is not the greatest speed which pupils 
are capable of attaining, nor is it absolute perfection in per- 
formance. To be sure, sixth-grade pupils should have a 
higher rate of speed in giving the combinations, 0-9, than 
third-grade pupils should have, and within these limits their 
work should be perfect. On the other hand, such high stand- 
ards should not be expected of them in the advanced work of 
their grade, or in fact in the more difficult phases of the pre- 
vious grade assignments. 
Without using an elaborate or exact method of testing, 
the relative standing of pupils in a class in accuracy and 
speed may be revealed in the following manner: 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  302 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
Rough tests of speed and accuracy in calculation 
Provide the class with primary arithmetics. Let them 
turn to the page on which are review exercises in addition 
combinations, 0-9. 
Directions: “At a given signal you [the pupils] will write on your 
paper the answers to the addition examples, placing your answers 
in the same order in which the examples occur. Write as rapidly as 
you can without making mistakes. 
‘As soon as one pupil has finished all the examples, I [the teacher] 
will give the signal to stop.” 
Note: For such a test half a page of these simple combina- 
tions is enough for fourth and fifth grades, and a whole page 
for grades above the fifth. 
At the signal to stop, all cease work. The teacher reads 
the correct answers while each pupil indicates with a cross 
his incorrect answers. (Papers may be exchanged among 
pupils according to the teacher’s judgment.) 
Let each pupil record at the top of his paper (a) the num- 
ber of examples attempted, (b) the number of correct an- 
swers. 
The teacher may then write on the board the number of 
examples attempted by each pupil. Rewrite these ratings 
in regular ascending series. The middle rating will be the 
median, half the class falling on one side of it, and half on 
the other. 
Without attempting to state what ought to be the stand- 
ard of the class or of each individual, the teacher will be safe 
in suggesting that each pupil below the median should try to 
increase his rate to the next point above his own. 
In the same way the range and median degree of accuracy 
may be determined. 
Even so simple a test as this will give to teachers and pu- 
pils a definite idea of individual ability in rate of work and in
-P-A-G-E-315
EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 3808 
accuracy that is much more inspiring than former general 
judgments. 
Following this test in addition combinations, 0-9, similar 
tests in subtraction, multiplication, and division combina- 
tions, 0-9, may be given, and tests in simple fraction and 
decimal combinations. Rate and accuracy tests of a similar 
sort may be given in single, double, and triple column addi- 
tion, and in more difficult examples in the other fundamental 
operations. 
The latest arithmetic textbooks contain tests of this sort, 
graded as to difficulty and with standardized rates of per- 
formance. They should be very useful to teachers who wish 
to have their pupils measure up to those in well-conducted 
schools in other parts of the country. 
Rough tests of reasoning ability 
It is desirable to know two facts regarding a pupil’s ability 
to solve problems: (a) how rapidly he can work, (b) how dif- 
ficult problems he can solve. 
To test the rate at which pupils “reason,” it is well to se- 
lect a page of very simple one-step problems. Begin with a 
page in a primary textbook as in the test for rate in calcula- 
tion. 
Let the pupils be ready with a slip of paper on which is 
written their name, and, in a column near the left-hand 
edge, numbers from 1 to 15 corresponding with the numbers 
of the problems. 
The books are opened to the selected page and pupils are 
asked to indicate on their paper the process to be applied in 
each problem. It can be done by using the signs, +, —, x, 
To determine the class medians for speed and accuracy, 
proceed as in tests for calculation. 
It is much more difficult to test the limit of abilities to 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
304 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
“reason” problems. No satisfactory “scales” have yet 
been devised. However, pretty definite information can be 
gained by testing on progressively difficult problems. 
Some conclusions from scientific measurement 
of arithmetic abilities 
The foregoing tests suggested for teachers who are un- 
trained in the use of scientific measurements are, as has been 
stated, not in any sense “‘scientific,”’ because the material of 
the tests is not standardized, the rate and accuracy of per- 
formance are not standardized, the conditions under which 
the tests are given are not standard conditions, and the 
method of calculating the ratings is not an exact method. 
Therefore, the results are only crudely indicative and they 
are of value only to the teacher and her pupils. They could 
not be properly judged in comparison with “standard” re- 
sults obtained by “scientific measurements,” although such 
comparison may be suggestive of strength and weakness in a 
pupil or a class. 
But, as in the case of other school subjects, scientific meas- 
urements in arithmetic have revealed some most important 
facts regarding arithmetic abilities that are of general inter- 
est to teachers. A few of them will be stated briefly. . 
1. There is no such thing as a general arithmetic ability. 
Each particular kind of arithmetic task requires a particu- 
lar kind of ability. Professor Monroe has pointed out that 
There are probably not fewer than 86 significant (i.e., socially 
important) types of examples (integers 30; common fractions, 36; 
decimal fractions, 20-40). This total does not include the specific 
abilities involved in the writing and reading of numbers, in the ta- 
bles of denominate numbers, and in the solution of problems. A 
complete diagnosis of a pupil’s abilities to do the operations of 
arithmetic would involve the measurement of his ability to do each 
of the 86 types of examples.*

, 2. Individual children differ very widely in their arithme- 
tic abilities. ' 
‘ It has been found that some fourth-grade pupils rate 
higher than some eighth-grade pupils in tests on the funda- 
mental processes. To put the same fact differently, there 
are in eighth grades a great many pupils of fourth, fifth, and 
sixth grade ability in arithmetic. 
Some pupils are naturally quicker but less accurate, 
others are slow and accurate, others still are slow and inac- 
curate, and yet others are both rapid and accurate. 
While it is difficult to determine whether or not in a given 
case inability in arithmetic is in reality native incapacity, yet 
a sure knowledge that pupils do differ in capacity willcause 
the teacher to give up any ambition to train all of them to 
meet a common standard. Her ambition will be rather to 
bring influences and methods to bear to the end that each 
one may improve in desirable specific directions. These 
desirable directions have been discovered by the use of 
“standard tests.” 
8. There is a limit beyond which it is not profitable to 
spend time in teaching arithmetic. 
It was very early discovered that the schools which de- 
voted most time to the subject were not those in which pu- 
pils ranked highest in arithmetical performance. 
4, Accuracy is not promoted by slowness. 
Experiments have seemed to prove that a pupil does not 
improve in accuracy by slowing down. On the other hand, 
he does not improve in accuracy by hurrying. There ap- 
pears to be an improvement in accuracy as a pupil ap- 
proaches his normal rate of speed when that is governed 
by a desire to do his best. 
5. It is not desirable to train pupils beyond the normal 
standard of their grade. 
Training with a view to attaining the highest possible
-P-A-G-E-318
  806 PROGRESSIVE EDUCATION 
point of excellence is as harmful as under-training, perhaps 
more harmful. 
Grocrapuy, History, ETC. 
Scales for measuring abilities in geography, history, and 
grammar have been devised, but comparatively little serious 
study has yet been given to these subjects. The “standards” 
and “scales” proposed up to the present time are so tenta- 
tive that they are not of much use to teachers. 
Maeasvurine INTELLIGENCE 
When we are measuring the performance of children in the 
various subjects of study, we are measuring their ability to 
do certain things in these subject fields under certain condi- 
tions. Attempts have been made also to measure general in- 
telligence; that is, to measure by one composite scale enough 
of the various kinds of intelligences to make a reliable basis 
for a judgment of mental development or mental age. 
The first successful scale for this purpose was not devised 
until about fifteen years ago.! This early scale has been 
perfected and with it those who have adequate training and 
experience can determine mental age with a good degree of 
accuracy, but not so certainly as to warrant final judgment 
without somewhat prolonged observation. No one is justi- 
fied in basing any conclusions whatever on the results of tests 
with it who has not had such training and experience. 
Professor Woodrow writes: 
" And how are we to determine the intelligence of a child except by 
the use of our measuring scale? There is no certain method. We 
must go ahead and make our measurements (by a specialist), then 
watch to see whether or not the future success of the child harmo- 
nizes with them.?

EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENTS AND TEACHER 307 
A teacher need have no concern regarding the intelligence 
of children who progress normally in school. In judging the 
mental level of those who are retarded, indifferent, and 
troublesome, she will find very helpful the suggestions for 
the recognition of mental defectives given in Chapter X. 
Guided by such analysis of abilities and activities that are 
shown in and out of school, she should seek the codperation 
of parents in experimental trials which may lead to a further 
revelation of the child’s mental needs and limitations. .

  To Comrades in Teaching Spelling: 
We all know that much written work in High Schools, and like- 
_ wise in Colleges, is marred by misspelling. We also know that pupils 
_ who misspell in High School will fail to spell correctly in correspond- 
ence later. SPELLING IS CHALLENGED ON EVERY SIDE, AND 
WE MUST MEET THE CHALLENGE. 
Too often we have considered Spelling an elementary subject, 
to be entirely mastered and finished before High School. This mis- 
take is the chief cause of our present difficulty. 
For many years, I have been studying the problems met in teach- 
ing Spelling. A year ago, I sent a questionnaire to the teachers of Eng- 
lish and other teachers of Spelling in High Schools throughout the Coun- 
try. More than a thousand teachers replied at length, pointing out 
the problems in their own schools. They asked for constructive sug- 
gestions for teaching Spelling, going into detail regarding the difficulties 
they encountered. Furthermore, they gave clear reports regarding the 
most effective means they were using to arouse interest and secure 
worth-while results. 
This Book is, therefore, the result of many years of observation, 
study and research, reinforced by the combined experience of able: 
teachers in the field. It offers the solution of the Spelling problems 
in High Schools, and provides a new and different approach to the 
work, not merely a review of lessons previously studied, but a founda- 
tion for the mature and continued study of the growing vocabularies 
needed in writing. It recognizes the intelligence, maturity, and ex- 
perience of the High School student, and secures his cooperation from 
the outset. 
The vocabularies, based upon the most recent scientific investi- 
~gations, are presented in related groups, thoughtfully selected because 
they illustrate interesting features of English word-structure which 
are fundamental causes of misspelling. The student’s initiative is 
appealed to. Self-help is inevitable. 
Read the Preface and the Analysis of Contents. Observe how the 
variety of presentation stimulates thought and overcomes the indif- 
ference bred of monotony. Correspondence, with your suggestions 
and criticisms, will be welcomed.

FOREWORD 
To TEACHERS: 
Is Spelling a High School Subject? 
Since experience shows that spelling has not been completely 
mastered in Elementary Schools, the High School has at present 
no alternative. Unless it makes good the proved deficiencies in 
spelling, the student graduates with a distinct handicap. The fact 
that he cannot spell shows that he is not yet endowed with power 
to teach himself to spell after graduation. That power has 
become more and more essential. Today, business men, the 
colleges, the general public, graduates themselves, challenge the 
results thus far secured in spelling. 
The Real Test of Spelling. 
Whatever may be the present attainment, the real test comes 
when new words are confronted. They will surely be met, for 
change of scene, of occupation, or of interest, will present a new 
and an ever-increasing vocabulary. Must these bring confusion 
and failure? Or shall we assure ourselves that our students have 
won both power and the consciousness of power to deal with new 
words as they come? 
Conditions Have Been Carefully Studied. 
Increased attention to the subject of teaching spelling has 
been induced by thoughtful study of the reports from High 
Schools and Colleges, which prove that training in spelling has 
not accomplished the desired and expected results. One inference 
from the returns is that too much has been demanded. The 
reaction is in the direction of presenting limited lists of the words 
most commonly used. This is undoubtedly wise, so faras it 
means a thoughtful and well directed study of the fundamental 
vocabulary. It has already developed a vigorous attention to 
the subject.

The Lessons Taught by Experience. 
But the chief cause of the disheartening results in spelling has 
not yet received emphasis. The teaching profession has assumed 
that spelling is wholly an elementary subject, to be mastered 
and completed in the elementary schools. We have maintained, 
in the age of greatly increased demands upon the individual, 
the theory that sufficed when education was narrow, and such 
demands were limited. 
\\The study of language demands life-long attention. We never cease 
learning the uses of words. We are always adding to our vocabula- 
ties: always encountering and needing to use new words. If we spell 
correctly when this test comes, it is because we have become conscious 
of the laws of spelling — the habits of the language — and because we 
have learned how to help ourselves and have accustomed ourselves to 
apply these laws. 
The One-Method Routine a Failure. 
Spelling has been taught largely by a single method, which, 
obviously, has not sufficed. Words have been selected, memo- 
rized for the time being, repeated in writing or orally, and the 
exercise has been marked, success or failure. Then more words, 
more memorizing, more repetition, and more marks. Teachers 
report the failure of this particular method, resulting in lack 
of interest in the subject. To overcome this indifference, this 
inertia, new methods must be attempted, and new interest 
aroused. To return, with no new appeal, to a subject supposed 
to have been completed, would naturally court failure. 
Teachers Report on the Subject. 
This book has been written to meet a need emphatically 
expressed by teachers of English and principals of High Schools 
throughout the country, to whom a questionnaire on spelling 
in High Schools had been addressed. Prompt and full replies 
declared the general need of help in teaching spelling. They 
outlined the phases of weakness in spelling, supplied lists of 
words repeatedly misspelled, and emphasized the need of con- 
structive methods of presentation. The statement came from
-P-A-G-E-7
es eee) eee EE EE Te OTE ee ee Nee ene ee 2 ne ee eee 
ili 
all sides that further use of lists of words, unsupported by 
intelligent methods of teaching, would be literally hopeless. 
Departments are striving to add instruction in spelling, even 
out of school-hours, to schedules already overburdened. 
The Causes of Misspelling Analyzed. 
These returns represent the judgment of mature teachers, 
with full knowledge of conditions. Their. reports have been 
analyzed and the causes of misspelling studied. They corre- 
spond to the misspellings of adults in the correspondence upon 
which the Ayres’ List was based. Single words had been taught, | 
supposedly; laws had not been mastered nor exceptions noted. 
The New Appeal: Recognized Aims. 
The author believes that High School spelling can be, and 
should be, constructive, developing power which will be of life- 
long service. It can summarize and build upon the knowledge 
gained through previous training; it can proceed with conscious 
aim and with new initiative on the part of the student, in the 
High School period. 
It should be open to all students and not limited to poor spellers, 
for none should be deprived of the new view and the maturer 
vision that a fresh motive and approach may give. It should al- 
ways enlist student initiative, and should employ to the full the 
class exercise, with its social experience, and its team spirit. It 
should train the students to appeal habitually to the Dictionary. 
It should raise the standard of clear speech —a social duty. It 
must make students conscious of the relation of letter signs to 
word sounds. And it should lead the students to the joy of 
mastering plain English, both spoken and written. 
The Social Exercise the Chief Factor in Practice. 
This can be done, chiefly through the constant use of the class 
exercise, in which free criticism is natural, and where everyone 
may help his neighbor; through the clear and constructive use 
of the present vocabularies of the students; through the study of 
groups of common words, which follow usual customs of spelling; 
 
-P-A-G-E-8
    
Iv 
through alert attention to troublesome words, the variants, 
the Stumbling Blocks; through taking possession of the indis- 
pensable monosyllable and the syllable groups; and through the 
conscious methods of self-training. 
Words Taught in Groups Exemplifying Laws. 
~ Words must be taught in groups, whenever possible, because 
recognition of type and the laws of spelling comes only through 
comparison and contrast. A rule is a recognized law applying 
to similar groups of words. Pupils must be able to recognize the 
group; also to point out exceptions to the law, or variants from 
ce group. 
The Groups Are Foundation Stones. 
The book provides constructive work in spelling; therefore, 
we study the structure of the language, and the laws of word- 
building. By this means with thoughtful repetition of recog- 
nized forms, students become able to master, unaided, the new 
words which experience constantly requires in their growing 
vocabularies. 
The words selected, for study and for illustration, in this book 
are taken from three fields: — 
» 1. The words which authentic investigations have shown to be 
_ most commonly used, and therefore essential. 
2. The words reported, by High School Teachers, in the replies 
to the questionnaire, as being often misspelled. 
3. Words needed to illustrate essential laws or customs of 
spelling. They are grouped because related in meaning, in use, 
in sound, or in form and structure, or because they vary from the 
type. All the words in the book, or selected lists, are to be 
spelled, according to the need of the class. 
,, Initiative Can Be Aroused : 
’ 1. By Class study of words or customs before the individual 
study or the fixed assignment. The first exercise, presenting a 
new idea, should always be discussion by the class. 
¥ 2. By Class practice, to bring out points under discussion, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  Vv 
to reveal both the strength and the weakness, the knowledge and 
the ignorance, of the students. Revealed difficulties should be 
followed by individual study and practice, recorded in the 
student’s exercise book. Class leaders, or team leaders, should 
help to supervise or test this individual work. 
VA 3. By Class contests, for skill and for interest; and Class 
tests, to discover whether understanding is general, so that the 
subject may be dropped. 
Develop the Individual. 
By definitely assigned exercises; by analysis of failures; by the 
use of the individual exercise book, with lists of words failed, and 
constructive exercises suited to overcome the difficulty. Since. 
strength in the individual strengthens the class, the team leader 
should help the individual to come up-to the standard. Class 
spirit brings out, the individual. 
In general, we can make constant constructive use of the 
student’s present vocabulary, We can work out rules in class. 
We can make constant appeals to the Dictionary. We can 
attack each troublesome word in the most effective way, ad- 
dressing efforts where they are most needed. We can dispose 
once for all of troublesome small groups of words. 
  Variety Is Essential: Always One Purpose. 
Some exercises should be oral, others written; some should be 
class exercises, others individual. All should tend not only to 
the immediate and correct spelling of the elementary vocabulary, 
but also to the development of needed power. 
The Textbook Supports the Work of all Departments. 
No High School can content itself with the limitations of any 
textbook or any single list of words. The English theme calls 
for one vocabulary, the business letter for another, the scientific 
analysis for a third; and soon. Every subject makes its demands 
upon the student, and reasonable ones. But all the problems of 
the new field can be brought to the class and solved in the light 
of laws which have been developed.
-P-A-G-E-10
  vi 
The textbook should make clear the General Principles, the ‘ 
Particular Exceptions, and the Foundation Stones of the Ele- 
mentary Vocabulary. It should show the student how to study 
new words. The Faculty should point out the words particularly 
required in their subjects, and help students to realize the impor- 
tance of including these words in their study. 
The Student’s Exercise Book: 
This book should provide the record of the Individual Prac- 
tice and Study. It must vary with the individual, emphasizing 
his needs and overcoming his difficulties. It should give evidence 
of his own effort, his peculiar vocabulary, his interests, and his 
own Mastery of Words. This record should be a true account of 
his progress and measure of his understanding. 
Plans of Instruction Varying With Conditions. 
The work must encounter many obstacles. It cannot count 
upon a fixed period of free time, in all schools, continuing through 
the four high school years. This book, therefore, has prepared 
not a regular and fixed program, but a collection from which every 
instructor and almost every student can serve himself, securing 
the thing which he most needs. This cannot be done with an 
invariable order. Subjects must be presented and plans of work 
suggested, exercises outlined and facts made accessible, through 
the textbook. These must be fundamental, typical, suggestive: 
and paving the way for Self-Help in Spelling. . 
The success of the work must be measured not merely by 
counting the words spelled, nor by our assurance that a certain 
list has been mastered. The real achievement is the student’s 
growth in power and his ready and independent mastery of 
new words, as they are encountered. 
The author gratefully acknowledges the generous help given 
by high school teachers, from every State in the Union, who 
gave such material aid in their full reports and their helpful 
suggestions in answer to the questionnaire which was sent them. 
All good wishes to those who join in our Common Endeavor 
to lay the Foundation Stones of Written English.

| ANALYSIS OF CONTENTS — FOR TEACHERS 
The Act of Spelling is naming or writing in order the letters of 
a word: but Spelling can never be mastered by the mere repe- 
tition of letters. 
Ability to Spell involves the prompt recognition of the Struc- 
ture of Words; while spelling correctly in one’s own writing re- 
quires understanding of the Meaning and Uses of Words. 
The lessons of this book, therefore, emphasize in turn: 
I. The Syllable-Unit in Word-Structure; 7-12 ff. 
II. Word-Building Showing the ‘‘ Make-up” of the Word: 
Adding a Suffix or Prefix to the Base; the Derivative; 
Inflections. 13-37 ff. 
III. Structure Related to Sound: — Sound-Analysis, studied 
for Constructive Spelling, and also for Clear Speech 
and the understanding of the Dictionary’s plan of 
showing Pronunciation. 40-69 ff. 
Structure related to Sound ‘is also taught in Clear Speech, 88- 
97 ff; and Queer Fashions in English Spelling, 80-87 ff. 
IV. Structure related to Meaning: — Derivation, Definition, 
and Synonyms; The Use of the Word in Sentences. 
103-121 ff. 
V. Accepted Structural Forms Required in the use of the 
Written Word; (since Spelling is to be used in 
Writing Sentences): — Punctuation; Capital Letters; 
Forms used in Letter-Writing, and permitted Ab- 
breviations, 133-142; Contractions, 100; Apostrophe 
in Possessives, 35. 
VI. Rules of Spelling. 
Major Rules. — (Concerning Suffix in Derivatives): 
$4, 36, 37;:70; 150. 
Customs and Rules concerning Letter-Signs for Word- 
Sounds: — 80-87. 
All Phonetic Structure, (40-69) is a basis of Common Customs 
or Rules, of Spelling.
-P-A-G-E-12

VII. Using the Dictionary as a Teacher, 4. The Dictionary 
shows Lists of Words in Alphabetical Order, 5-6. 
The Dictionary Shows Words Divided into Syllables, 7. 
The Dictionary Points out the Accented Syllable, 9. 
The Dictionary Shows Pronunciation: by using Diacriti- 
cal Marks; by Respelling, using Equivalents, 40-61. 
The Dictionary Shows the Meaning of Words: by Show- 
ing Derivation; by Definitions; by Using Words in 
Sentences; by naming Synonyms, 103 ff. 
The Helps afforded by the Dictionary are analyzed, and ex- 
plained. Students are expected to use the Dictionary in all lessons. 
All Lessons either explain some structural feature of Spelling, or afford 
practice in it, or both. The syllable, the base, the suffix, the prefix, 
the inflection, the sound-unit, letter or phonogram, are examples. 
The feature, custom, or rule is presented to the Class and discussed 
by the class, with exercises to make it plain. Practice is added at fre- 
quent intervals later. This review, which takes the form of a new 
lesson, has its basis in sound Psychology. It leads to the habitual appli- 
cation of the principle involved. 
Exceptional customs, and unusual groups of words are vividly pre- 
sented, and made to light up the common custom or form, which is never 
clearly discerned except by comparison and contrast. Variations from 
the type should be mastered in groups;— (shown by the cei group). 
Miscellaneous groups of Lessons, and variety in length and in treat- 
ment, make it possible for all teachers to select lessons and to drill 
according to the needs of their class, and the time now available. 
In Group-Structure, Lists, Related Words and Inflections,.the author 
has definitely avoided the inevitable confusion of the terms stem and root 
in relation to the two types of derivatives. The structural term, base, 
is used whenever a suffix or prefix is added to a word already in use in 
English. The process is Word-Building, and the base is the foundation- 
word upon which the derivative is built. 
The more remote syllable, born in the dim past, handed down through 
many languages, perhaps, and properly known as the root, belongs to amore 
mature and scholarly study of derivation. The term “ derivative,” 
however, belongs to both modern and primitive History of Words. The 
derivative has been reported by thoughtful observers as being the chief 
stumbling block in Spelling.

AUTHOR’S LETTER TO STUDENTS 
This book is addressed to you, Students in High Schools, 
because you are now passing through a critical period of your 
Education. Consciously or unconsciously, you are more and 
more facing forward, eager to learn, and assuming more and 
more the direction of your own training. 
These pages take account of what you have already learned, 
and make ready for the tests that Life will provide when your 
lessons in school are ended. 
A living language, like a human being, is always changing. 
With the War came new and vivid experiences, and, therefore, 
many new words. A new vocabulary accompanied the advent 
of the telephone, the telegraph, the automobile, the aeroplane, 
and the radiograph. Nobody has yet reached the end of learn- 
ing to spell. 
This book, then, does not attempt to present to you the last 
lesson in spelling. Far from it! It opens to you, for your own 
earnest participation, a life-long series of lessons, all of which you 
must guide, and through which you will develop abiding interests, 
growing power, and richer understanding. 
It aims ‘to lead you to the easy, right, and satisfying use of 
written words, as long as you live; and to the clear speech which 
you owe to those who hear your spoken words. It promises 
continual progress along enticing roads, and the constant joy of 
growth in power, in interest, and in understanding. 
For you, the book has been written; to you it is hopefully 
addressed, and with you it faces forward. Only through your 
own initiative, your own team-work, and your own hearty shar- 
ing in the spirit of the game, can it lead you to the 
MASTERY OF WORDS

THE CLASS EXERCISE 
The two essential exercises in learning to spell are the Class 
Exercise, and Individual Study and Practice. 
In the class one gets all the advantages of Teamwork. Every 
member of the class makes his contribution. It may be ques- 
tion, comment, illustration of the fact under discussion, or writ- 
ing exercises upon the blackboard. All these things help. All 
sides of the question come up, because different minds work 
differently. Even the misunderstandings and mistakes will help, 
if they lead to a clear explanation. 
To the Class Exercise, then, one may give much, by entering 
into it with a will, and taking part as he would in any other 
contest or game of skill. The study may prove that the entire 
class has mastered the subject; or it may show that more study 
or practice is necessary. Then should follow the individual 
work, in which each pupil seeks to overcome his own particular 
difficulty, as revealed by the Class Exercise. 
The Slogan for the Class is Good-Will: Every one helps to 
make the lesson worth while for every other member of the class. 
But in the end, the mastery of spelling, or anything else, de- 
pends upon the individual. Unless one reaches out for under- 
standing, eager to learn, he cannot be taught. Knowledge and 
power are won, not found: we pay for them with our own earnest 
effort. If we go to our work with a will, it will be well done. 
For Individual Practice, then, there is but one indispensable 
element, — The Will to Learn. 
  
Copy into your notebooks, and learn by heart, these famous lines. 
So nigh is grandeur to the dust, 
So near is God to man, 
When Duty whispers low, “‘Thou must,” 
The Youth replies, “I can.” — Emerson.

THE GENERAL PLAN OF STUDY 
1. Lesson introduced: (in the text, by the author.) 
2. Class study of the new lesson, with teacher; discussion; 
illustrations drawn from the experience of the students and from 
their ordinary vocabulary; individual failures noted. 
3. Class practice or drill, for greater familiarity and skill. 
4. The class contest; led by the teacher or by the chosen 
leader. This sums up the lesson and shows whether it is generally 
understood. Continued failures indicate need of more study. 
This may be a general or an individual need. 
This class contest is a game of skill, testing both the indi- 
vidual and class. Individual skill advances the team; individual 
failure holds it back. 
5. An exercise book should be maintained and gradually 
written by every student. Its chief uses are: 
(1) To record usual customs of spelling observed by the 
class and illustrations furnished by the individual. 
(2) To note small groups of words varying from the usual 
custom and to add other illustrations which occur from 
time to time. 
(3) To note exceptional words which must be studied 
separately, and learned by sight. 
(4) To list, and use properly, all words misspelled by the 
student. 
6. The test (not contest) is like any other “examination.” 
Its object is to find out whether one has mastered a point or 
the truth in question. One may test himself; he may be tested 
by the class or through exercises assigned by the teacher. 
Self-examination .is always profitable; class examination is 
helpful; — while the teacher’s examination must give the final 
measure. The record shown in the exercise book is the most 
complete individual test which can be offered. The class itself 
should suggest needed tests and make ready for them.

The Dictionary as a Teacher of Spelling 
For Reading and Discussion 
The story of the Dictionary.is an interesting one. In 1783 
Noah Webster published his spelling book, which was afterwards 
widely used throughout the country. This foundation for read- 
ing proved so useful that the author determined to write a book 
which would help the people of this new and young country to 
teach themselves, and to maintain and increase their knowledge 
of the Mother Tongue. 
People who read and travel little, are likely to have a limited 
vocabulary, and often a faulty one. In the earlier days, traveling 
was difficult, and homes were scattered. It was hard to get 
books and many families had to do without them. Webster 
hoped to bring our rich and beautiful language within the reach 
of all the people of America. 
To gather together the words of the language, to make their 
meaning plain, and to arrange them so that they would be easily 
found, was no slight task. All the last years of Noah Webster’s 
life were devoted to this task. 
He accomplished his great life-work, however, and made this 
remarkable gift to the people of America. The latest edition of 
Webster’s Dictionary contains over 400,000 words, — the rich 
accumulation of centuries of English Speech. 
Other good Dictionaries have since been written and are in 
common use. Every class, every home, and at last every indi- 
vidual, should be provided with a Dictionary. 
The Dictionary should be our chosen Teacher of Spelling. 
For the proper use of the Dictionary, study and practice are 
necessary. 
Can you, readily and rapidly, find a word in the Dictionary ? 
Can you understand the Dictionary signs used in showing pronunciation? 
Do you know the meaning of the abbreviations used by the Dictionary? 
Have you learned to enjoy an Unabridged Dictionary ?
-P-A-G-E-17
  5 
Words in the Dictionary are in Alphabetical Order. 
All lists, or records, must be arranged in an orderly fashion; 
otherwise they will be useless. To find a word in a list, you 
must understand its particular order or plan of arrangement. 
The accepted order is the alphabetical order. Words of the 
Dictionary are arranged in Alphabetical Order. 
Alphabetical Order means, in the first place, that the order of 
the initial letters of the list is the order of the letters of the 
Alphabet. 
Examples: Apple, ball, crow, dove, eggs, fish, grass, hills, Indian, jelly, 
king, lily, moon, nest, oven, peach, quail, rice, sugar, tea, usual, violet, 
well, Xenophon, yard, and zinc, are in alphabetical order, so far as 
the initial letter is concerned. 
Apple, eggs, hills, moon, violet, zinc: are in alphabetical order. 
Omissions do not count. The arrangement of initials is still in the 
order in which they are found in the alphabet. 
In Complete Alphabetical Order all the letters of every word 
must be considered. If it happens that the initial letters of two 
words are the same, the second letter determines the order: if 
first two letters are the same, the third determines the order: and 
so on, even to the last letter of words alike in the initial letters 
or syllables but differing at the end. 
Examples: Hail, hair, half, hall, halloo, hallow, halo, halt, are in 
alphabetical order. 
All these words begin with ha; the last six begin with hal. Why 
does hair follow hail? Why does hall follow half? Why does hallow 
follow halloo? And halt follow halo? 
  
Are you looking for a word in a Telephone Directory? You 
need to know Alphabetical Order. Do you wish to find a topic 
in any Index? Or a name in a city Guide Book? Or a town 
in a Railway Time Table? Without knowing Alphabetical Order, 
you waste time, and perhaps fail to find the name wanted. 
Prepare yourself for these ordinary necessities.

The Dictionary Shows Words Divided into Syllables 
In speaking, we unconsciously divide our words into parts, 
which we ordinarily neither think about nor name. The voice 
in speech does not come forth in one unbroken sound; rather, 
it is like a chain, in links, or units. With a single impulse of the 
voice we may pronounce a word, as no, or man; or merely a part 
of a word, as no-ble, or man-ly; no-bility, or man-liness. 
It requires one impulse, or push, of the voice to say man; 
two are required for man-ly; three for man-li-ness. 
Pronounce the following words, and feel the number of pushes, 
or impulses, which are required for each word. 
affect direct appear begin 
affection directly appeared began 
affectionate direction appearance beginner 
affectionately indirectly apparently beginning 
We have seen that some words are spoken with one impulse 
of the voice. The words, big, wish. shall, fox, wing, are examples. 
These are words of one Syllable. 
Webster’s Dictionary tells us that a Syllable is an ele- 
mentary sound, or a combination of such sounds uttered 
together with a single effort or impulse of the voice, and 
constituting a word or a part of a word. 
Words of one syllable, only, are monosyllables. A word of 
two syllables is a dissyllable; of three syllables, a trisyllable; 
while a word of four or more syllables is called a polysyllable. 
The word sense is a monosyllable; senses is a dissyllable; sensa-

1. Read and discuss the text on the preceding page. 
2. Write upon the blackboard in lists: ten monosyllables, ten 
words of two syllables, and ten polysyllables. Divide each word 
of the last two lists into syllables, using the hyphen (-). 
3. Select ten pupils to write the following words upon the black- 
board, properly divided into syllables. Correct errors. Then use 
the words in appropriate sentences.

The Dictionary Points Out the Accented Syllable 
Looking carefully at words in the Dictionary, we find that 
some syllables are separated from the following syllable by the 
hyphen (-), as is customary when syllables are divided in writing. 
But after certain syllables we observe a short, sharp, slanting 
line ('), instead of the hyphen, which points out the Accented 
Syllable. 
In all words of more than one syllable, one syllable is pro- 
nounced with greater emphasis than any other. In bal’ance, 
village, and sep’arate, the first syllable is thus stressed. In 
dis pute’, af fect’, be lieve’, the final syllable is emphatic. 
This stress on a syllable of a word is called Accent. The 
Accent Mark, or Sign of Accent, is that short, sharp, slanting 
line (’), placed just above and after the syllable stressed. 
If a word is very long, it may have two accents; a strong, 
or Primary Accent, on one syllable, and a less strong, or 
Secondary Accent, on another. In this case, a lighter mark 
is used for the secondary accent. Im-pos’si-bil’i-ty, un’- 
mis-tak’a-ble, show the two accent marks. 
The hyphen between syllables is omitted by the Dic- 
tionary when the accent is indicated by the accent mark. 
CLASS EXERCISE 
1. Review the lists of words in preceding lessons, pointing out 
the accented syllables. Write the words upon the blackboard, properly 
syllabicated and accented. If in doubt, consult the Dictionary. 
2. For quick decision and rapid oral drill, point out the accented 
syllables in a paragraph or page of some textbook used by the class. 
  
Form the habit of observing the syllabication and accent of all 
new words. Look them up in the Dictionary. 
To misplace the accent is to mispronounce the word.

The Base and Derivatives 
CLASS EXERCISE: For Discussion 
The original word or primitive form of a word, which is not 
derived from another, but is the stock or root from which other 
words are derived, is called a root. 
But many English words modify their form to express changes 
in the idea. This change is usually made by adding a prefix or 
suffix to a foundation word, called the base. If a syllable is 
placed before the base, it is called a prefix; if written at the 
end of the word, it is called a suffix. 
Familiar examples are: play, player; use, usual, usually, useful; 
order, orderly, disorderly. In these examples play, use and order 
are base-words; the others are derivatives. 
Select a page from your history or from a reading book, and name 
the derivatives found on the page. Point out the meaning of the 
different derivatives, and name the base of each. 
Words Tied Together by Meaning; Base and Derivative

Practice in Word-Building 
The Base and Derivative in Related Groups 
The base carries the family meaning belonging to the group; the 
suffix and prefix indicate different shades of meaning, applying to 
different members of the family. 
Example: Author, names a person who writes. He authorizes the 
use of something he has written; that is, he gives to another authority 
to use it. Authorship means the identity of the author, or means the 
work done by an author in writing. ‘The authorship of the book was 
not known.” Authorship may be his profession or business; that 
is, he may write books to earn his living. 
The meaning of the base-word, author, runs through all these 
words, but the suffix modifies this meaning. 
CLASS EXERCISE: Groups of Related Words 
Spell and use in sentences, showing the meaning of each word 
and how the derivative is formed from the base. 
Point out the base of each group, and the prefix or suffit. Discuss 
the effect of the prefix or suffix. Give examples of similar groups.

How the Compound Word is Built 
CLASS EXERCISE: Compound Words 
Two or more words, expressing different ideas, spoken or 
written together to express one idea, make a compound word. 
Non-conductor, deathbed, out-of-the-way, are such words. 
The parts of compound words are sometimes separated by a 
hyphen; but not in the greater number of such words. 
A language is always growing and always changing. It often 
happens in the development of the language, that the hyphen drops 
out after the word becomes familiar. The process is always going 
on. There is therefore no exact rule for the use of the hyphen for 
all compound words. If in doubt consult the Dictionary. 
Compound words must be guarded in spelling because the in- 
sertion of the hyphen where it does not belong is a form of mis- 
spelling. The problem with compound words is to know when 
to use the hyphen and when to omit it. 
Watch for words containing the hyphen and list them in your note- 
book. Insert the hyphen only when you know that it is required. 
Compound Words: With and without the Hyphen 
Make a collection in your exercise book of compound words in 
which the hyphen occurs: Among them include some of the follow- 
ing words. Use each word in a written sentence. 
death rate son-in-law half-mast 
post-office father-in-law half title 
folk song sister-in-law halfway 
up-to-date four-and-twenty man-of-war 
go-as-you-please forty-four office-holder 
happy-go-lucky one-hundred-fifty time-table 
self-esteem ex-Governor worn-out 
self-praise President-elect well-to-do 
self-respecting acting-chief time-honored
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 
Word-Building: Compound Words 
In the development of the language certain words have been 
joined to make one word, so that a single word takes the place 
of a phrase or even a sentence. We speak of the weather fore- 
cast or a bystander, not thinking how these words came to take 
their present shape. 
Study the following words to see how they were built and what 
meaning they have, getting help from the Dictionary both at home 
and at school. Expand the words into phrases or clauses. 
forecast side-tracked pathfinder rock-ribbed 
bystander light-winged deerslayer loving-kindness 
wheelwright keen-eyed roadster tight-fisted 
butterfly dreadnought high-minded close-mouthed

Compound Words: Without the Hyphen 
Each of the following compound words must be written as 
one word without the hyphen. 
All compound pronouns, also, are written without the hyphen. 
Make a list of similar words in your exercise book. Include 
all the compound pronouns (myself, themselves; .and whoever, 
whatever, eic.).

Syllabication: Compound Words 
CLASS EXERCISE: Oral and Written 
When dividing a word into syllables, the prefix or suffix is 
usually written as a separate syllable. This is because the 
meaning of the word appears more clearly in such a division; 
(dis arm, wn able). 
Divide the following words into syllables. Use each word in a 
sentence; explain its meaning. Spell. Name similar words. 
forego forerhost foreground foresail 
forecast foresee forefathers forenoon 
undertake underneath overwork overdue 
undergo underwrite oversee overland 
outside _ outdo outlet outcome 
outskirts outlay outrage outgo 
inlet inside within withdraw 
income indoors without withhold 
highland highway afterglow afterwards 
highroad highminded afternoon aftertime 
In writing, as in print, a word may be broken at the end of a 
line, and a part of the word carried to the next line. This 
break is indicated by the hyphen. 
Compound words which are written with a hyphen should 
never be thus broken except at the place where the hyphen 
occurs.

GRAMMAR HELPS SPELLING: The Parts of Speech 
Sentences express thoughts. They are made up of words, which are 
signs of ideas. 
Words have different uses in the sentence and are divided accord-. 
ing to their use, into eight Parts of Speech. 
The uses of words in sentences are these: 
1. They name objects, and are called nouns. 
A noun is the name of an object. 
2. They take the place of a noun, to prevent too much repe- 
tition and awkward speech. Such words are called pronouns. 
A pronoun is a word which takes the place of a noun. 
3. They describe objects (red, big), or point them out (this, 
that), or number them (one, two). Such words are called adjectives. 
An adjective is a word which is used with a noun, to express 
quality, to limit or define it, or to indicate number. 
4. Words express action, doing something (throw, push), or 
they express merely being or existing (is, were), and are called 
verbs. Every sentence must contain a word which can assert. 
A verb is a word which asserts action or form of being. 
5. Words may modify the meaning of a verb just as adjectives 
modify a noun. Such words are called adverbs. An adverb may 
also modify an adjective or another adverb. 
An adverb is a word joined to a verb, adjective or an- 
other adverb, to modify its meaning. 
  
These five Parts of Speech have different forms to express different 
shades of meaning. In all but pronouns, the original word, which is 
called the base, takes an added syllable to show this change in 
meaning. Such change in words is called inflection.
-P-A-G-E-33
  
21 
6. A word may join another word to the word which it 
modifies, or introduce a phrase. Because these words are placed 
before the important word of the phrase, (noun or pronoun), 
they are called prepositions. 
A preposition is a word which introduces a phrase, and 
joins a noun or pronoun of the phrase to the word which it 
modifies. 
7. A word may join together words, phrases, clauses or even 
sentences. Such words are called conjunctions. 
A conjunction is a word which joins words, phrases or 
clauses. 
8. A word may express surprise, joy, or some other emotion, 
apart from the thought of the sentence. This word is “ thrown 
in’ between the sentences and is called an interjection. 
An interjection is a word, apart from the sentence, express- 
ing some sudden emotion. 
Prepositions, conjunctions and interjections do not change 
their form through inflection. 
Words Having Different Uses 
Some words have more than one use, having different reta- 
tions to other words in the sentence. They are classified accord- 
ingly in different parts of speech. In the sentence, “I walk to 
school,” walk is a verb, but in “I had a long walk,” walk is a 
noun. 
The word duplicate has three different uses; it is an adjective, a 
noun and a verb. In reading the Dictionary it is important to note 
all the uses of the word in order to understand the definition.

Regular Inflections of Verbs, With Changes in Spelling 
CLASS EXERCISE: For Discussion and Study 
Verbs change their form, (and spelling), to show changes of 
meaning. These changes in form are called inflections. 
Examples: He walks to school. He walked to town last night. 
He is walking for exercise. He had walked a mile before I met him. 
In these examples the verb changes to indicate time: this inflec- 
tion is called tense. 
In the Present Tense, indicative, the verb changes its form in 
the third person singular number, taking the ending s or es. 
I walk, he walks; I watch, she watches; I change, it changes. 
In every case, s or es is added to the verb to “ agree with the 
subject,” as the rule has it. 
The Past Tense and Past Participle take the endings d or ed, 
while the Present Participle takes the ending ing. 
I walked; I have walked; I am walking. 
The Dictionary notes these changes in the form of verbs, show- 
ing the endings of the past tense and past participle, and some- 
times of the present participle. The form which the Dictionary 
defines and lists, is the present infinitive, always used with to. 
This form of the verb, without to, is the present indicative. 
The Present Tense, Past Tense, and Past Participle, are the 
Principal Parts of the verb. 
Bring a Grammar to the Class, to recall conjugations, and other 
definitions. 
Look up the following words in the Dictionary to see what forms 
are indicated besides that of the infinitive. Write on the blackboard 
all the verb forms whose endings are given by the Dictionary. 
enjoy regard engage publish 
carry escape employ allow 
obtain destroy select arrest
-P-A-G-E-35
  
23 
Groups of Regular Verbs, Showing Inflections 
The inflections of regular verbs reveal certain customs of 
English spelling which underlie the major rules of spelling. 
They all are concerned with the suffix, added to the verb-base. 
1. Observe that the base may remain unchanged when the regu- 
lar suffixes —s or es, ing, and ed — are added. 
paint load watch ben efit 
paints loads watches ben’efits 
painting loading watching ben’efiting 
painted loaded watched ben’efited 
2. But note that final silent e is dropped before the suffix 
es, ed, or ing, all of which begin with a vowel. 
hope plane accuse replace 
hopes planes accuses replaces 
hoping planing accusing replacing 
hoped planed accused replaced 
3. Also observe that in monosyllables, or in final accented sylla- 
bles, the single final consonant, if preceded by a single vowel, is 
doubled before ed and ing. 
hop plan admit occur 
hops plans admits’ occurs 
hopping planning admit’ting occurring 
hopped planned admit’ted occurred. 
4. Note also that final y — if preceded by a consonant — changes 
to i before es or ed; but not before ing. 
try pity study obey 
tries pities studies obeys 
trying pitying studying obeying 
tried pitied studied obeyed 
  
These Inflections illustrate the Major Rules of Spelling.

example following. Add, when possible, a noun from the same 
base. Note any irregular inflection.

CLASS EXERCISES 
Language is mastered by use. The Class Exercise emphasizes 
many aspects of the word studied, and affords good practice. 
The Exercise may combine both speaking and writing. It brings 
out various meanings of words, because different minds use words 
differently. Most words have many meanings. 
At its best, the class exercise is like any other good game. 
In a boat race, every rower helps to win; the strength and skill 
of every man count; his weakness or his lack of skill hinders. 
So, in a good recitation or discussion every pupil contributes 
something, and his knowledge or skill counts for the class. 
Take pride in making your contribution, and bring to the class 
the spirit of true sport. 
  
Study the base and the derivatives; compose sentences for each 
word; spell the words, or write sentences from dictation. 
Attend carefully to syllabication and accent.

The Inflection of Nouns 
CLASS EXERCISE: Number, Singular and Plural. 
Nouns which name one object are said to be in the singular 
number and are called singular nouns. Boy, shop, knife, pony, 
rose, are in the singular number. Nouns naming more than one 
object are in the plural number. Boys, shops, knives, ponies, 
roses, are in the plural number. 
Nouns change their form to indicate number; they are inflected. 
Inflections always indicate a difference in meaning, and always 
—in regular forms — are made by adding a suffix to the base. 
Nouns add s to the singular number to form the plural. 
Exception: When the noun ends with s, or a sound which 
will not unite with s, es is added. 
Glass, glasses; match, matches; box, boxes, are examples. 
WRITTEN EXERCISE: Plurals 
Write the plural of the following nouns, using them in sentences. 
Explain in every case why es is added instead of s. 
driver Mary matron match 
lawyer Kate maid sledge 
farmer Mr. Smith master carriage 
scholar Mr. Brown servant ax 
senator Mr. Clark veteran box 
minister John dentist league 
Certain nouns have irregular plurals, which virtually are new words 
and do not need a rule of spelling. Man, men; ox, oxen; mouse, 
mice; woman, women, are examples. 
The two Mr. Browns. The other Johns. 
The three Marys. ‘“‘ The ayes have it.” 
Avoid awkward plurals. A phrase may be substituted, as in this 
example: 
My two cousins, each called Kate. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  
34 
CLASS EXERCISES: Plurals, Regular and Irregular 
1. Write ten regular plurals which require merely the addition 
of s to the singular. 2. Write ten plural forms which require the 
addition of es to the singular. 
3. Write a list of ten irregular plurals; as mouse, mice; man, men. 
Rules of Spelling for Certain Plural Forms 
1. When a singular noun ends in y, preceded by a consonant, 
the y changes to i in the plural form and es is added. 
Examples: study, studies; duty, duties; canary, canaries. 
(Observe that the behavior of nouns ending in y is exactly like the 
behavior of verbs with the same ending. They follow the same rule.) 
2. Some words ending in f, or the sound of f, change f to v in 
the plural and add es. This is not true of ff final; to which 
s alone is added without change of the consonant. 
Examples: loaf, loaves; puff, puffs; knife, knives 
Plural Nouns Ending in -ies 
Spell each plural; then spell the singular, and use in sentences 
both singular and plural. 
countries authorities bodies burglaries difficulties 
enemies beauties duties boundaries galleries 
groceries centuries salaries factories ladies 
companies liberties families histories armies 
legacies qualities inquiries deputies societies 
policies quantities libraries luxuries varieties 
  
If a noun is a part of a compound word, it may still change its form, 
to denote number. Refer to the Dictionary for such plurals. 
man-of-war sister-in-law grandchild 
men-of-war sisters-in-law grandchildren
-P-A-G-E-47
35 
Inflection of Nouns: The Possessive Case 
A noun may indicate possession, or ownership; it is then said 
to be in the possessive case. (John’s book; the men’s coats; 
the world’s work). Such a change in form is an inflection. 
The sign of the possessive case in the singular is the apos- 
trophe and s, placed after the word denoting ownership. 
John’s hat; the boy’s ball; Mary’s book; the bird’s wing. 
When the noun ends in s, in the plural, the apostrophe only is 
added; otherwise, the plural follows the rule. 
Men’s hats; bakers’ bread; the Joneses’ car; are examples. 
Warning: The apostrophe is never used to indicate the possessive 
case of a pronoun. It’s is the contracted form of the two words it is. 
EXERCISE: Individual 
Use the following nouns in written sentences, in both the singular 
and the plural possessive form. Bring the written sentences to the 
class, for exchange, correction, and discussion of any difficulties 
that may arise in either writing or correction. 
  author niece hero lady 
captain shepherd woman victim 
doctor villain child visitor 
governor fly man pastor 
partner enemy sister church 
John’s hat Mr. Brown’s dog  Tom’s sister 
Mary’s dress The Browns’ car The Joneses’ barn 
The boy’s sled The wife’s story The Balches’ picnic 
The boys’ books The wives’ stories The Smiths’ farm 
These are examples of the ordinary use of the apostrophe.

  36 
Inflection of Adjectives and Adverbs 
CLASS EXERCISE: The Suffixes er and est 
Adjectives are inflected if they express quality. They change 
their form to indicate a greater degree of the quality, and this 
inflection is called comparison.. The monosyllables add er to 
show that the object has a greater degree of the quality indicated: 
as thick, thicker; strong, stronger. The suffix est indicates that 
the quality exists in the greatest degree, as sweetest, thickest. 
Adjectives of more than one syllable are usually compared by 
using more and most: modern, more modern, most modern. 
Adjectives thus compared are said to be in the positive, com- 
parative or superlative degree; the addition of er indicates the 
comparative degree, while est shows the superlative degree. 
The following examples name the forms used: 
Positive, rich; comparative, richer; superlative, richest. 
Positive, beautiful; comparative, more beautiful; superlative, most 
beautiful. 
Adverbs of manner are inflected like adjectives; as, Jack ran 
faster than Jane. Your work is done most cheerfully. 
Customs of spelling must be noted in connection with these in- 
flections of adjectives and adverbs, just as with verbs and nouns. 
1. If the positive degreé ends in y (preceded by a consonant), 
y is changed to i before the suffix er or est. Examples: happy, 
happier, happiest; merry, merrier, merriest. 
2. Adjectives or adverbs ending in silent e drop the e before 
er or est. Examples: blue, bluer, bluest. 
3. Adjectives or adverbs ending in a single consonant preceded 
by a single vowel, double the final consonant before the suffix er or 
est if the base is a monosyllable. 
Examples: big, bigger, biggest; glad, gladder, gladdest. 
Discuss the text above; then choose leaders to test the power of 
the class to spell correctly inflected adjectives in common use. They 
may be listed on the blackboard for study, before the test.

Changes in spelling when suffixes are added to the base 
CLASS EXERCISE: For Discussion and Illustration 
The base sometimes changes when a suffix is added. In order 
to study these changes, we must recall certain facts. 
1. Spelling a word is naming or writing the letters of the 
word in their proper order. 
2. The letters of the alphabet are either vowels or consonants. 
3. A, e, i, 0, u, and y are vowels; the other letters of the 
alphabet are consonants. 
1. When the suffix begins with a vowel, a base ending in e 
drops the e. 
Fine + al = final; move + ing = moving; _ blue + ish = bluish. 
Exceptions: final ce and ge, when the suffix begins with a, as in 
peaceable, changeable. 
2. When the suffix begins with a vowel, a base ending in 
y (preceded by a consonant) changes to i, before it. Final y is 
retained, however, before the suffix ing. 
Carry + es = carries; daisy + es = daisies; pity + ed = pitied; 
but play + ed = played. Playing, staying, retain the y. 
3. When the suffix begins with a vowel, and the base ends 
with a single consonant, preceded by a single vowel, the final 
consonant of the base is doubled, if the base is a monosyllable, 
or if the final syllable is accented. 
Examples: hop, hopping; run, runner; compel’, compelled’; quit, 
quitted. 
Add any suffix you choose, to any familiar words illustrating 
these rules and having these endings. Decide upon the correct spell- 
ing, with the help of the rules and the Dictionary. 
  
These three Rules are Foundation Stones. Carefully observe all 
words to which they can be applied, for they will enable you to master 
the spelling of a great number of words.

The Dictionary Shows the Sound (Pronunciation) of 
Words by Using Diacritical Marks 
All spoken words can be separated into their sound elements. 
These are represented in the written words by letters or groups 
of letters. Separating a word into its sound-elements may be 
called Sound-Analysis. Naming or writing the letters in order 
is Spelling. 
In the English Alphabet there are twenty-six letters. Six of 
these are called vowels; (a, e, i, 0, u, and sometimes y). These 
stand for vowel sounds, voice sounds, made by the unimpeded 
breath passing between the vocal cords and out through the 
mouth. In the other sounds the voice is checked or modified in 
the throat or by the help of the teeth, tongue, or lips. They 
always accompany the voice sounds, never making a word alone, 
and are therefore called consonants. 
Every syllable must contain a vowel, but not necessarily a 
consonant. The terms vowel and consonant name both the 
sounds of the language, and the letters which represent them. 
All the sounds of the language must be represented by twenty- 
six letters. Since there are more than forty sound-elements in 
spoken English, some letters must be used to represent more than 
one sound. To such letters some sign must be added to show 
their sound in a given word. The signs, or marks, which are 
thus added to letters to indicate sounds are called Diacritical 
Marks. These marks are in constant use in the Dictionary; 
therefore, we must learn to know them.

The Vowel Sounds in English: with Diacritical Marks 
The Long and the Short Sounds 
All vowels have a long sound, sometimes called the name 
sound, because the sound is the same as the name of the letter. 
The long sound is marked by the macron (~), placed above the 
letter. The following examples show the Long Vowel Sounds. 
a as in dle, ate; € as in éve, Eva; ias in ice, Ida; 6 as in old, 
dcean; a as in ise, inion; ¥ as in style, apply. 
All vowels have also a short sound, marked in the Dictionary 
by the breve (~) above the letter. 
& as in St, tix; € as in égg, énd; i as in ink, city; 6 as in ndt, 
odd; & as in ctip, rust; ¥ as in happy, mystery. i 
Italian a (4) 
The vowel a has a third sound, called the “ open throat” 
vowel, or Italian a. This oftenest occurs before r in the same 
syllable, as in farm. It is marked with the dieresis over the 
vowel (i). 
Examples: hark, part, army, cirgo, startle, regiird, mamma. “ 
The Long Vowel a Before r 
Long a has a modified sound, when preceding r; it is shown 
in bare, spare, stare. This sound of a is marked by the circumflex 
above the a (a). 
Examples: fdre-well, faring, cAring; from fare and care. 
Make lists, in class, of twenty familiar words, to illustrate the 
sounds defined above. Write the words, with the diacritical marks, 
upon the blackboard.   
date act army care 
place back charge dare 
able rapid farther prepare 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 
Vowel Sounds Modified Before r: Equivalent Sounds 
All vowels are modified when followed by r. The following 
examples show that er, ir, or, and ur have practically one sound. 
The unusual combination, yr, has the same sound. This sound 
is marked by the tilde (~), over the vowel, except in the case 
of u, which is marked by the circumflex (*). 
Examples: férn, hérd, clérk, térm; bird, stirred, chirp, 
birch; word, work, world, worm; cir, carl, barr, farl; 
martyr. 
The common sound of o before 7, however, is that shown in 
corn, form, storm, remorse. This is called the broad sound, and 
is indicated by the circumflex above the vowel: (cérn). 
CLASS EXERCISE: Oral Test 
Divide the class into two teams, each having a leader. Test on 
the sounds thus far presented, and the use of diacritical marks. 
Call for extended lists, to be suggested by the class. Failures, 
either in correctness or promptness, count for the opposite side.

Broad a, and the Middle a, as in Fast 
The broad sound of a occurs in wall, walk, Walter, crawl, drawn. 
It is marked by the dieresis, placed below the letter (a). 
The vowel a has a middle sound, less marked than the Italian 
a; it is shown in fast, last. This sound of a is marked with one 
dot above the a, (4); gldss and mdster are other examples. 
Intermediate and Obscure Sounds of a 
The vowel a, which is the hard-working vowel of the language, 
has a great variety of sounds. In addition to those already 
described, it has, in all unaccented syllables, a much less em- 
phatic sound. Long a (a), in unaccented syllables, becomes 
half-way long and is marked thus: (a). We find this mark over 
ain the Dictionary pronunciation of senite, voyage, fortunite. 
Initial a, standing alone in unaccented syllables, is quite 
obscure in sound. If the syllable were accented, the sound would 
be like a in fast. This sound is represented by the italic a with 
a single dot above (a); and the same mark is used for final 
obscure a. The Dictionary shows this mark in ddult, dmong, 
dbove, ddrift, and in sofa, and ided. 
Short a (a) in unaccented syllables is italicized and marked 
with the italic breve. Mordl, findl and ovdl are examples. 
All these obscure sounds are slightly different, but not to 
the untrained ear. In studying spelling, observe carefully all 
vowels in unaccented syllables. 
Repeat the exercise of the previous page, illustrating all these 
obscure sounds of a.

440 
Diphthongs 
Certain vowel sounds are represented by two vowels, which 
are sounded in combination. These are called diphthongs. Oi 
and oy, as in spoil, noise, joy, oyster, annoy; and ou and ow as 
in spout, devour, sour; howl, scowl, crowd, are diphthongs. 
The sounds oi or oy, may be separated into 6-i, if slowly 
pronounced; while ou or ow will become 4-00, when spoken, 
slowly. The natural ‘‘glide” blends the sounds. 
The single vowel i represents two sounds blended into one 
(a-i), and is really a diphthong. Long u represents two 
sounds (i-00 or y-00), blended. 
In a few cases, a and e (pronounced @) are united in a 
syllable, becoming a true diphthong; asin Ane’as. 
Make two lists, in class, for oi and oy, and for ou and ow, to 
determine whether their positions in the word are alike or different. 
State your conclusions in writing. Copy the conclusions, with the 
lists, in your individual notebook. 
Vowels Doubled 
The vowels e and o are doubled to indicate certain sounds. 
The “double e”’ (ee) is sounded as long e (é), and very often 
takes its place. Keep, sleep, deep, creep, are familiar examples. 
The ee is not marked. 
The double o (00) has two sounds, long and short, marked 
like a single vowel, with macron and breve: 60, long, as in ndon, 
spoon, food; 60, short, as in b06k, good, stood. 
A is doubled in only a few instances, as in Aaron, Isaac, bazaar; 
while i, y, and u are not doubled.

Obscure Vowels in Unaccented Syllables 
All the other vowels are like a in having a less emphatic long 
sound in unaccented syllables. This varies all the way from a 
slight flattening of the long or full sound, to the complete elision 
of the sound. 
We speak of these sounds either as.half-way long, or obscure 
sounds. The Dictionary marks the unaccented long sound by 
placing a short line over the macron (*), as in preface, évent, 
obey’, natiire. The obscure short sound is indicated by italics. 
It is important to fix the attention on the accented syllable, and 
then to note the vowels of the unaccented syllables. One of the most 
difficult problems of spelling centres in the obscure vowel of unac- 
cented syllables.

46 
The Vowel u 
The vowel sound called long u is really a complex sound. It 
consists of 60 preceded by i or y as in yes. Y00, (or i-060), is its 
true pronunciation, when initial. The sound appears clearly in 
ase, init; also in ctéire; acite. 
This sound of @ is not easily made in English words, without 
close attention. It is most easily spoken at the beginning of 
a syllable. It is the true sound of long a. 
In words containing u, when the preceding sound tends to pass 
over the y, the sound of u becomes plain 60: as in rude, true, 
blue; and is marked u. 
U also has a sound like short 66 in fo0t. You find this in 
pull, push, pudding, sugar. (This sound is marked u.) 
The Vowel y 
The letter y stands for the sounds of the vowel i, when it is 
not a consonant. It is a duplicate vowel. Even its consonant 
sound partakes of the vowel sound. 
In try, apply, tyrant, the y is long, and should be marked as other 
long vowels, with the macron (¥). In happj, silly, and cr¥stal it has 
the short sound, marked with the breve (¥). In martjr, before r, 
it still behaves like i, and has the same mark that i would have in 
the same place (¥). 
Look up in the Dictionary ten words containing either long u 
or u. See if your ear detects the difference in pronunciation. Write 
the words upon the blackboard, marked according to the Dictionary. 
Copy into your notebooks.

For Quick Recognition of Vowel Sounds in Spelling 
1. Pronounce each word in the following list, dividing the word 
into syllables, and naming the accented syllable. 
2. Point out the vowel of each syllable, giving and naming its 
sound, and its appropriate diacritical mark. 
3. Use every word in a sentence which clearly shows its meaning; 
then spell the word.

Consonant Sounds in English 
Many consonants, like the vowels, do double work, rep- 
resenting more than one sound. It is necessary to group them, 
therefore, and to observe the work done by each letter, in spelling. 
Consonants Having Only One Sound 
The consonants which ordinarily have but one sound, and, 
therefore, cause little trouble in spelling, are listed below, in 
words which clearly show their sound. They require no diacritical 
marks. 
b as in baby, bib; f as in feel, feed; h as in his, hold; j as in 
just, jelly; k as in kill, kick; 1 as in let, lame; m as in man, 
mind; p as in pen, pup; r as in red, ring; t as in tell, tan; was 
in we, wing; v as in vote, vein; y as in you, yell; z asin zebra, 
zeal. 
Consonants Having More Than One Sound 
Consonants having two different sounds cause much confusion in 
spelling. C, g, and s require careful attention. 
The Sounds of c 
The consonant c has two sounds. In the words cell, ceiling, 
since, ¢ has the sound of s as in sing. ‘This is the soft c. Its 
diacritical mark is the cedilla (,), placed beneath the letter, as 
in cell. The Dictionary substitutes s for soft c, in pronouncing. 
In the words can, cold, cup, zinc, critic, c has the sound of k. 
This is hard c, designated sometimes by a short horizontal line 
drawn through the letter, thus: (e). In showing pronunciation, the 
Dictionary substitutes k for hard c.             
      
    
            
     The soft c is used before e, i, and y 
                   city civil Nancy catch escape 
cent, decide Lucy cost comfort 
recent, accept Cyrus close custom      
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 
The Sounds of g 
G, like c, has two sounds, soft and hard. The hard sound is 
almost invariably used before a, 0, and u, or before a consonant; 
as in go, gap, gun; grip, glimpse. 
The soft sound of g (marked §g) is like the sound of j; as in 
giant, orange, dingy. Where the Dictionary shows pronunciation 
j takes the place of soft g. This sound occurs only before e, i, 
or y; but g is sometimes hard when preceding those vowels. 
Note carefully words containing the sound of j, for the ear does 
not show us whether g or j is used in writing the word. 
The Sounds of s 
S usually represents one of two sounds; the hissing sound, as 
in snake, sing, silver; or the sound of z, as in rings, does, doves. 
The hissing sound has no diacritical mark; s having the sound 
of z is marked thus: (gs). This sound of s is called the soft sound, 
and z is used in the Dictionary pronunciation: (haz, iz.) 
The Sounds of x and z 
X always stands for two sounds. It represents ks, as in taz, 
oxen; or-gz, as in example, exist. 
Z has ordinarily its familiar sound, as in zinc, zeal, prize. 
In a few words, however, it has the sound of zh, as in azure; 
zh is then used in the Dictionary, in showing the pronunciation: 
(azh’tr.) 
The Sound of q 
Study in the Dictionary the list of words beginning with q. 
Note that q is always followed by u, and that qu must always be 
followed by a vowel, never by a consonant. Qu represents the 
sounds of kw. Examples: quail, queen, quite, quote.

Additional Consonant Sounds Represented by Two Letters 
The Consonant Digraph 
There are certain indispensable sounds of the English language, 
which are represented by two consonants. The sound represented 
is not the equivalent of the two consecutive sounds, but they 
are usually blended into one, as ng in sing. Sh, as in ship, shall, 
shudder, dish, wash, crash, is such a sound. We hear it often 
alone by itself, a warning Hush! Sh! 
Two letters representing a single sound in this way constitute 
a digraph. The digraphs included in the consonant group are: 
sh, ch, ph, th, wh, ng, gh. Their sounds are shown below. 
sh as in ship, shall; th as in this, that; 
ch as in chin, much; ng as in ring, long; 
ch as in chaise, machine; wh as in while, what; 
th as in thin, thick; ph as in graphic, cipher; 
gh as in trough, laugh. 
CLASS EXERCISES 
Point out the consonant digraphs in the following words, show- 
ing the sound of each. Illustrate each sound in a word which 
you use in a sentence. 
Learn the derivation of the word digraph. Name and illustrate 
five consonant digraphs, showing the sound of each. 
laugh crush rather Ralph 
charming machine thinking naphtha 
touch whistle singing whimper

  Digraphs and their sounds should be studied until they are as 
familiar as the single letters of the alphabet. Fix your attention 
on any that are unfamiliar, and observe the words in which you 
Sind them.

Silent Letters: A Problem in Spelling 
CLASS EXERCISE: For Discussion and Spelling 
If every letter had its own sound, and if there were a separate 
letter for every sound, spelling would be a simple matter. The 
English language has more sounds than letters, and many letters 
represent more than one sound. In addition to these troubles, 
many English words contain silent letters, which are not heard 
in the spoken word, but must be remembered in writing. 
In the word day, we hear two sounds and see three letters; 
in rogue, are three sounds, but five letters; in yacht, three sounds 
and five letters. In all these words are letters which must be 
remembered when we write, but never pronounced in reading or 
in speaking. 
The eye must always be alert to detect the silent letter. The 
Dictionary does not point it out in pronouncing the word; it 
simply omits all silent letters. 
Words Containing Silent Letters 
Point out the silent letter in each of the following words. In every 
case name another word, similar in both form and sound, in which 
the same silent letter occurs. Then spell the word. 
Use the words of the list in sentences composed and dictated by 
the class, and written upon the blackboard.

Letter-Groups, or Phonograms 
A character or symbol used to denote a word, a syllable, or a 
single sound is called, in shorthand, a phonogram. 
The term phonogram may be applied also, in spelling, to a 
single letter or a group of letters, representing a single sound, 
or a sound group, whether as a single word, or a syllable, or 
a part of a syllable; as ate, abate, late. 
The letter group may contain either a single vowel and the conso- 
nant associated with it, as Ad, if; or two vowels with a single consonant, 
as ate, ime; or two associated vowels with a final consonant, as ain, éat, 
Phonograms may be alike in sound but different in form. They 
provide good material for a Class Contest. 
Words Containing Rhyming Final Phonograms 
Words to be compared and contrasted. Note the rhyming phono- 
gram, and name other words having the same final phonogram, 
af possible. Then use the word in other sentences. 
After studying, spell orally, and promptly, using the word in a 
new sentence to show its meaning.

Many mistakes in spelling arise from the fact.that two different signs 
may stand for the same sound. It is not enough to know the sound 
of aword; its form and meaning must be associated with the sound. 
Table of Equivalent Vowel Sounds, for Drill 
Here are different vowels, single or in combination, which 
are often used to represent the same sound; (equivalent phono- 
grams). 
a =6 wash — odd ea =€& bean — complete 
ey =4 they —ate oa =6 goat — mote 
é=4 there — care ew =i dew — duty 
a =€@ liar — miner ew = 00 brew — brood 
i= 6 police — even igh =i light — hide 
i=é first — stern ay =4 hay — late 
6=t son—sun eigh = 4 eight — ate 
9 = 60 woman — wood ei =é receive — recede 
9 = 60 do—choose ie = @ belief — impede 
6 =a horse — warn ow = 6 arrow — hero 
6 =€@ minor— miner ou =6 pour — pore 
u = 060 rule — fool ou = 00 soup — pool 
u = 00 full — wool ue =i argue — use 
¥=1_ fly —ice ui =i build — filled 
y =i hymn—him aw =6 caw —corn 
y =€ martyr — sister au =6 author — order 
ai=4 rain— mane uy =i buy —ride 
er = ir = ur = yr; her, fir, fur, myrrh. 
Oi, with its equivalent oy, is a diphthong; so is ou, as in 
out. Ou has an equivalent, ow. Long u and long i are really 
diphthongs. Long u equals %-00, while long i equals d-é. 
Look intently; listen carefully. Find out, after any error in spell- 
ing, just why you made that mistake. Then be sure to master the 
misspelled word, once for all.

How the Dictionary Shows the Pronunciation of Words 
Respelling 
We have observed the use of various combinations of letters 
to represent the same sound. The following words, which rhyme, 
illustrate this problem: 
Care, fair, pear, their; sheet, meet, feat, deceit; rate, great, 
eight, straight; school, rule; wool, pull; boys, noise; ball, haul. 
This problem is met by the Dictionary with the device of 
Respelling. One of the rhyming or equivalent sounds is chosen 
as the type or example, and substituted for the other letters or 
phonograms. Thus, 6 is substituted for a in ball in respelling 
(b6l); 00 is used for u in rule (rdol); 4 is used for au in taunt. 
(This device helps in determining the pronunciation of a 
word, but it does not master the spelling of the word. The 
use of equivalent phonograms will be studied later. The ac- 
cepted substitutes used in respelling in Webster’s Dictionary 
are listed on the opposite page.) 
CLASS EXERCISE: Words that Rhyme 
Distinguish between the words of the following pairs, showing 
clearly how the endings differ in form, although sounding alike.

The Dictionary in Respelling Uses the Following Plan 
The letter c never appears. When hard, k stands for it; when 
soft, s stands for it; also for sc, ss ands. (cent = sent; miss = mis) 
The letter d when it sounds like t, is represented by t. (ld0kt) 
The letter g in respelling stands for its hard or true sound only. 
The letter i stands for itself And y, or any vowel digraph that has 
the sound of i. (dryly = drili; height = hit) 
The letter j stands for itself and for soft g. (ginger = jin’gér) 
The letters qu do not appear; kw and in a few instances k alone 
represent them. (queer = kwér; liquor = lik’ér) 
The letter z stands for s sounding like z; also for itself. (has = hiz) 
The digraph wh is reversed in respelling; hw, showing the order 
of its sounds, takes its place. (while = hwil) 
The digraph sh stands for itself, for soft ch, as in chaise, and all 
other combinations which are pronounced sh. (chaise = shiz) 
The digraph th is not marked when it stands for the voiceless 
sound; it is marked by a horizontal line drawn through it when 
voiced. (breath, breathe). 
The diphthong oi stands both for itself and for oy; (i invariably 
takes the place of y in respelling). (joy = joi) 
The diphthong ou stands for both ou and ow. (owl = oul) 
The letter u with the macron stands only for the true sound of 
u, the diphthong or blended vowel sound, i-00. When u sounds like 
60, that symbol is substituted. (use = uz; rule = rool) 
  All vowel digraphs are represented by the single vowel having the 
same sound as the digraph. 
Silent letters are in no way represented in Dictionary respelling, 
which takes account of sounds only. Therefore they must be care- 
fully observed in every word studied for spelling.

Homonyms: Alike in Sound, Different in Meaning 
Certain pairs of words in common use, chiefly monosyllables, 
are alike in sound but have different meaning. These words are 
called homonyms and have been familiar to us from the beginning 
of our writing. Nevertheless frequent errors in the use of these 
essential words occur at all stages of our study of English. We 
must search for the cause of the trouble, and find its cure. 
Examples of Homonyms 
grate — great suite — sweet troop — troupe 
— their — there stile — style told — tolled 
pride — pried wait — weight throne — thrown 
scull — skull minor — miner rote — wrote 
  Three things concerning homonyms should be remembered. 
1. To the ear, the two words sound ewactly alike. 
2. To the eye, they are both alike and unlike. Some 
letters are common to both, but there is always a 
difference in spelling. 
3. In thought, and in use, they are totally different; in mean- 
ing they are extremely unlike. To confuse them, there- 
fore, shows want of thought or else ignorance of 
their meaning, and form. 
The cause of the misspelling is that we note the likeness in 
sound and stop there, thinking no further about the word; there- 
fore, we select the wrong word when writing. 
The cure is to make the difference in meaning prominent, and 
to use the words in ‘sentences, until the different forms are in- 
Stantly suggested by the meaning of the word. 
Practice often the making of new sentences to fit these troublesome 
words. Continue this until they cease to be troublesome 
  
To select and use the wrong homonym is to misspell. 
   
-P-A-G-E-75

Class Exercise in Homonyms 
Study these pairs of words in class; use each word in sentences. 
Spell orally, as words are dictated, using this model.

words. Suggest other words containing the same final letter-group.

CLASS EXERCISE: For Discussion and Practice 
Final Silent e, in Common Phonograms 
The silent letter which is most familiar is the final silent e. 
This is oftenest found following a single consonant, preceded by 
a long vowel, as in plate, face, incline, repose, amuse. 
The final phonograms which end in silent e are so common 
that it is quite worth while to know them as essential letter- 
groups. They must be carefully noted in applying important 
rules of spelling. The following letter-groups, or phonograms, 
contain long a and end in silent e. 
ace: lace, place, replace ame: same, shame, blame 
ade: lade, glade, degrade ane: sane, plane, insane 
afe: safe, chafe ape: cape, shape, escape 
age: rage, stage, outrage ase: base, chase, erase 
ake: lake, flake, forsake ate: date, skate, relate 
ale: tale, stale, regale ave: pave, crave, deprave 
aze: daze, blaze, amaze 
Extend each list in class, using other familiar words. 
Add words suggested by students, so long as the exercise is profit- 
able. When all are familiar with the long a group, and readily add 
to the lists, build groups of words with similar final phonograms 
containing the other vowels. 
  
Knowledge of the sounds of the language is called Phonetics or 
Phonics, from the Greek word Phonos, meaning sound. The same 
root-word is in telephone, graphophone, phonograph. : 
The Knowledge of Phonetics helps spelling, as well as pronunciation. 
Without it one masters only one word at a time, instead of conquering 
the related group. Phonetics helps in consulting any alphabetical list 
or file. It is the basis of Shorthand.
-P-A-G-E-79
67 
The Vowel-Digraph 
When two vowels are associated in the same syllable, as in 
bread, pain, coal, appear, one vowel is usually silent. This com- 
bination is not a diphthong, in which the blended sound makes 
a modified vowel sound as in boy; it is the vowel-digraph. 
The vowel-digraph may have different sounds in different 
words. Thus, ea is pronounced 4 in great; € in meat; but é in 
bread; while ei is é in receive, and i in height.

The Major Rules of Spelling, Affecting Derivatives 
You have already discovered in your practice that certain 
changes in spelling may occur in Derivatives, when the suffix is 
added to the base. These changes always require particular 
attention to the final phonogram of the base; for the application 
of the rule depends upon the presence of certain phonograms. 
The major rules are these which follow. 
1. Silent final e is dropped before a suffix beginning with a 
vowel. Hope, hoping; please, pleasing; force, forcible. 
A reasonable exception: the final silent e is retained in deriva- 
tives, when it follows soft c or g, in order to maintain the soft 
sound of the consonant. Examples: peace, peaceable; change, 
changeable; singe, singeing. 
2. Final y preceded by a consonant changes y to i, before a 
suffix beginning with a vowel (unless the suffix begins with i, 
when it keeps its place, to avoid doubling the i.) Study, studies; 
pity, pitiable; fly, flying; study, studying. 
No rule is needed for words ending in y, preceded by a vowel, 
for there is no change in such words. Key, keys; play, player, 
playing; valley, valleys. 
3. Words ending in a short voweled phonogram (a single 
consonant preceded by a single vowel), double the final consonant 
before a suffix beginning with a vowel, if the base is'a mono- 
syllable, or is accented on the final syllable. Ship, shipping; 
omit’, omit'ting; refer’, refer'ring; plan, planned; but, o'pen, o’pen- 
ing; differ, dif'ference; complain’, complain'ing; shipment. 
Observe that all these rules require quick recognition of the final 
phonogram and the accented syllable. 
Make lists in your exercise book to prove these rules. 
  
hope singe study plan 
hoped singed studies planned 
hoping singeing studying planning

Lists of Words for Study (in Related Groups) 
(For Discussion before Studying the lists) 
The words in the following lists are arranged in related groups, 
in order to secure the advantage of the common meaning, the recog- 
nition of the use of the suffix or prefix, and the mastery of the par- 
ticular form which is common to the group. Each member of the 
group helps in the mastery of the entire group. This likewise takes 
advantage of the law of association, which supports the memory. 
Failure to take advantage of the group would mean waste of 
time in the study of unrelated words. It would also mean failure 
to gain power from building on previous experience. Those who 
have learned to spell have consciously or unconsciously mastered 
the laws which govern such groups. So far as we have customs 
in the use of language which give us related groups, we should take 
advantage of all that these groups can reveal to us. 
In any mature study of language, we must search for the law or 
ruling principle that runs through such groups of words in our own 
vocabulary. When any base-word is studied, we should master the 
entire related group, once for all. 
This saves time and effort, and gives us added power in spelling. 
The miscellaneous list, however, offers the severest test of the 
knowledge of the word. After the groups have been studied, and 
mastered, the separate words should be assembled in miscellaneous 
lists for tests, contests and reviews. 
  
The true and final test is the ready use of the word when it is 
needed in writing. And since no help may be near when this test 
comes, and since, in business relations, the penalty attached to mis- 
spelling may be heavy, our best efforts must be given to mastering 
every troublesome word.

one which is composed for you. If the word seems unfamiliar or 
awkward, make more sentences in which it is plainly used. That 
makes the word yours.

Queer Fashions in English Spelling 
CLASS EXERCISES 
This section, called Queer Fashions, is inserted to secure 
attention to both the usual and the exceptional behavior of 
letters in English spelling. 
The behavior of certain letters provides a basis for rules of 
spelling. One who observes closely can judge whether the final 
sound of k,in a new word, should be spelled with k, c or ck in 
writing. A little observation will keep you from using j as a 
final letter. The exceptional appearance of letters like u as 
silent letters should be recognized, and the group affected 
should be mastered, once for all. 
Collect in your notebook groups of words which illustrate these 
Queer Fashions. If you listen for examples in conversation, or watch 
for them in reading, you will greatly stimuiate your sense of word 
sounds and your interest in spelling. Your own lists will be much 
more useful to you than any lists arranged by others, for you. 
The Behavior of q 
Q is an odd letter; it never represents a sound without help, 
but always requires the presence of u, which follows it. Together 
these letters have the sound of kw, as in queen, quell, quality. 
There are a few exceptions, as in antique, and pique, where the e 
with the u is silent, and q has the sound of k alone. The u remains 
beside it, however. 
Study in your Dictionary the words which begin with qu. What 
vowels oftenest follow these two letters? 
  
Noah Webster hoped that his Dictionary would help in the education 
of the American people. He wished them to be eye minded, using 
words in books and in letters, and not merely ear minded, knowing 
the language only through spoken words.
-P-A-G-E-93
  81 
The Behavior of x, th, f, and v 
In writing syllables remember that x never begins a syllable; 
it always ends one. 
ex ist tax ing ex hib it vex 
ex act fix ing ex am ine vex a tion 
The equivalent of final x ordinarily requires three letters, 
cks; cs is more likely to represent the sound in words of more 
than one syllable. 
wax box mix vex annex 
wicks locks sticks wrecks civics 
F and v are twin sounds, made in exactly the same way, except 
that f is a breath-sound, while v is somewhat vocal (sub-vocal). 
It is interesting to see the exchange of these consonants in related 
words. 
Some nouns ending in the sound of f, change f to v in the 
plural. 
elf leaf life loaf 
elves leaves lives loaves 
A similar exchange occurs in related nouns and verbs. 
relief belief grief thief 
relieve believe grieve thieve 
The same change takes place in words ending with the sound 
of th. The breath sound changes to the sub-vocal sound, when 
the noun changes to a verb. 
breath wreath cloth 
breathe wreathe clothe 
  
Knowing letters as the Signs of Sounds is indispensable to 
the Mastery of Spelling. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 
The Sound of j Final Is Never Written j 
J never appears at the end of a word whose final sound is j. 
You will always discover ge or dge there, the e being silent, 
but evidently protecting the sound of g or the preceding vowel. 
Without final e, g would be hard in urge, and i would be short 
in oblige. 
bandage rage urge judge bridge 
suffrage outrage oblige badge knowledge 
The Behavior of n, w, and wh 
The letter n makes one variation from its usual habit. It 
sounds like ng before k or the sound of k or qu sounding like kw. 
In these cases it is spoken back in the throat and is exactly like the 
nasal ng. 
bank honk conquer trunk anchor ink 
brink monk conqueror shank banquet zine 
W is a queer letter, representing a half-vowel (or almost 
wholly vowel) sound. The two initial sounds wh and w must not 
be confused. The first (wh) is hd and the second (w) is 60. In 
the initial wh the letters are practically reversed in sound, the h 
preceding the w; and it is pronounced hw, while w alone is 00. 
Compare the initial w’s throughout the following list, plainly 
showing this difference in your clear pronunciation 
whack which where work whistle 
whale what whey wash wherefore 
wharf while while would weather 
when whither whenever weave whether 
W is really silent in whole, wholly, whose, whom. In these words h 
alone is sounded because the oo blends with the succeeding vowel. 
  
page paging sink wharf weather 
judge judging bank wheel whether 
   
-P-A-G-E-95
  
83 
The Behavior of c, k, and ck 
The work of k is divided between k and c. The sound of k is 
oftenest represented by hard c (cat, cup, custard). At the end of 
a monosyllable, however, k often follows after c, but they repre- 
sent the single sound; (sick, back, clock, whack). 
This final ck is retained in derivatives (blacking, knocker, sickest, 
lucky). In these cases c could not do the work alone, for following 
its usual habits it would be soft before e or i, and could not represent 
the sound of the base. 
The k sound final in a word of more than one syllable is repre- 
sented by c alone (civic, frolic, cubic). In asmall group of words, 
however, final k (sounded) is que (written); physique, unique. 
The sound of k is sometimes, but not often, represented by ch. 
This is always in words derived from the Greek or the Hebrew. 
(Chasm, choir, and chorus are from the Greek; patriarch is from 
the Hebrew.)

CLASS EXERCISE: Discussion and Word-Listing 
The Various Sounds of the Digraph ch 
The consonant digraph ch requires attention, because it behaves 
differently in different words. Its ordinary sound is that which 
occurs in chimney, church, rich, much. We find it occurring both 
as an initial and final sound. This sound is unmarked in the 
Dictionary respelling. 
In words which come to us from the French, ch has the sound 
of sh, as in machine, chivalry, chaise. This is the soft sound and 
is marked as the soft c is marked, by the cedilla placed beneath 
the c; (machine). 
In words which have come to us from the Greek, ch has the 
sound of k, as in character, chemist. This is marked by the short 
line drawn through the c, as in its equivalent hard e (eh). 
Thus, ch may be pronounced ch, sh or k, and is a cause of 
confusion. It calls for alert attention. 
. In one more situation ch should be noted. At the end of words 
it is often preceded by silent t, as in match, watch, ditch. Re- 
turns from the field show this is a frequent cause of misspelling; 
the t is often omitted when it should be used, or inserted where 
it does not belong. 
This mistake happens in our commonest words. Guard against 
it and help your class to overcome this difficulty. 
Build, in class, lists of words to show the behavior of ch in 
its various sounds. Consuli your Dictionary.

The Sounds of s; Often sh or zh 
When the hissing sound of s is final we find it represented 
either by s, ss or ce, while a common sound of final s is the soft 
or “buzzing ” sound, like z. 
hits miss bliss once lace runs 
laughs kiss chess dance place moves 
An occasional sound of s is that of zh, as in pleasure, or vision; 
or like g in words derived from the French, as garage; while in 
sugar and sure, its sound is that of sh. 
Determine the sound of s in the following words. See how the 
letter is marked in the Dictionary respelling of each word. Is it s? 
or 2? or sh? or zh? Use the words in sentences. Spell. 
aspiring glimpse result various 
disguise hustle tension season 
distress prison vision reason 
emphasis loosen fusion sugary 
factories oasis leisure insurance 
The Sounds of z 
Z has ordinarily its familiar sound, as in zinc, zeal, prize, 
zealous: in a few words, however, it has the sound of zh, as in 
azure and glazier. This is noted in the Dictionary respelling. 
The sound of z final is written either s or z or zz. In the third 
person singular of verbs and at the end of plural nouns s is always 
used for this sound. When z does appear it is almost invariably 
followed by silent e, and is usually preceded by a long vowel.

Customs and Rules of Spelling, Related to the 
Sounds of Words 
The Final Sound of 4 
Long a, final, is usually represented by the vowel digraph ay; 
in a very few cases eigh or ey; but never a. 
delay today weigh they prays 
stay relay sleigh convey obeys 
gray array neigh obey delays 
When s is added, no silent e intervenes. 
These endings of the base-word may be carried into a deriva- 
tive, still ending the base, but no longer ending the word. 
staying grayish playing weighing obeyed. 
praying grayness playful sleighing obeying 
Prepare, for a class test, a list of twenty words ending in the sound 
of long a. Use these in an oral Class Contest, to quicken the sense 
of syllable sounds, and the ready recognition of phonograms. 
If any student fails, he should use the misspelled word in a 
sentence, not leaving the word until he has spelled it correctly. 
Other rules may be derived from “Queer Fashions.” 
The Signs of Hard g 
There are many signs of the hard g, among them being the 
silent u, after g, or the consonants 1 and r following it. These are 
found in: 
guilt grasp glitter guard ground glum 
guess guild grip glove glass grumble 
  
play weigh obey . guilt grow 
playing weighing obeying built glue

The Cultivation of Clear Speech 
To Read, Discuss, and Illustrate 
  Slow pronouncing is a kind of sound analysis. It separates 
the syllables, which are the major units of sound. This clear 
articulation develops the syllable sense, and greatly helps toward 
correct spelling. 
In ordinary speech words are often blended and their vowels 
elided. The familiar pronunciation of the phrase ‘‘ I am going to” 
shows this. It would be difficult to spell the ordinary pronunci- 
ation. This is an extreme case. Some elision is both ordinary 
and reasonable. It is an element of musical speech. 
On the other hand, the words of a public address must be 
spoken much more clearly, and with greater precision, so that 
the entire audience will hear whatever is said. Actors have 
thorough training in clear speaking. Reading aloud requires 
more care, as to enunciation, than everyday conversation. 
The oral exercises in spelling are training drills in clear speech. 
In these it is reasonable to over-emphasize obscure syllables 
until their form is fixed. It is much better to say @vil’ for a 
time, and thereby to remember the i, than to elide the i, and then 
to spell the word evel. 
  Practice clear speaking. Appoint judges to mark the class 
in Enunciation. The test may be reading a paragraph or a 
list of words, so that everyone listening will hear and under- 
stand. 
Reading poetry aloud and listening to poetry will increase 
pleasure in clear speech as well as rhythm. It will also help 
to develop the Syllable-Sense and the recognition of accent 
and emphasis. 
Practice reading aloud, both at home and in class. Learn by 
heart poetry that you like, and recite it to the class. Accept 
criticism cheerfully. 
 
-P-A-G-E-101

CLASS EXERCISES: Clear Speaking 
Words Ending in ing 
Pronounce clearly words ending in ing. The final sound is 
never n, in such words, but is ng. If this final syllable is often 
slighted in your school, drill on lists of words containing it. 
Decide this question for yourselves. 
making reading hurrying taxing filling 
smiling writing worrying waxing swinging 
running spelling climbing fixing ringing 
knocking working steaming asking singing 
doing playing smoking pushing hanging 
The Suffixes ness and less 
The suffix ness should not be pronounced ‘‘ niss.” It is better 
to over-emphasize the e than to substitute the i. Words in 
which this suffix occurs must be spoken slowly. The same rule 
applies to the suffix less. 
illness hardness _—_ sweetness harmless __ restless 
dullness mildness thickness useless tactless 
dryness goodness quietness endless voiceless 
wetness wildness earnestness soundless ruthless 
softness roughness worthlessness noiseless smokeless 
The Suffixes ent and ence 
The suffixes ent and ence require careful attention. Although 
the vowel is obscure, it retains the e sound. Short u should 
never be substituted. 
frequent moment element patience 
patient document ~ instrument experience 
decent monument subsequent monuments

-P-A-G-E-102

Clear Speaking (Continued) 
Words Ending in aw 
Words ending in aw are often carelessly pronounced, as if 
ending with r. This happens oftenest when the final aw precedes 
a word or syllable beginning with a vowel. One hears “‘J sor 
im go,” for “I saw him go”; “I can’t drar it” for “TI can’t draw 
it”; “drawring” for “drawing.’”’ Do not shirk the burden of 
pronouncing these words correctly. Pause a little, after the aw, 
but do not insert the r. 
drawing cawing pawing thawing saw him 
sawing clawing gnawing cawing draw it 
Words Ending in a 
Final @ (obscure) should not be pronounced er. Take pains 
when this final syllable precedes the initial vowel of the word 
following. ‘Move the sofa in here”; (not soferin); ‘Who put 
that idea into your mind?” (not idearin). ‘Is Martha in the 
kitchen?” (not Martherin). Such. combinations require a slight 
pause to separate the final vowel from the next word. 
Drill on Consonant Combinations 
Some consonant combinations are hard to pronounce, and are 
slighted when final. Clear speaking requires vigorous exercise 
of the throat muscles in words like the following. These com- 
binations cannot be hurried; they must be spoken slowly. 
facts dragged taxed shields rounds 
ducks drugged mixed fields wounds 
reflects rigged fixed worlds stands 
instructs sagged relaxed holds finds 
reacts lagged boxed wields grounds 
Bring to the class nonsense rhymes or sentences for practice in clear 
speaking. Compose such sentences for use in class contests. It should 
require careful attention to read or pronounce the sentences correctly.
-P-A-G-E-103
91 
Consonant Groups Which Require Attention 
Initial shr must be spoken slowly and clearly. Do not substi- 
tute s for sh. Practice on lists like the following; look up the 
words beginning with shr, in the Dictionary. 
shrink shrill shriek shroud 
shred shrug shrank shrimp 
shrine shrub shrunk shrivel 
When words end in sm, rm, Im, or thm, no vowel sound should 
be inserted between the consonants. Holmes, in ‘‘The One-Hoss 
Shay” speaks of ‘wood from the settler’s ’ellum,” and makes it 
rhyme with “sell ’em.” Lowell, in his famous “‘Biglow Papers” 
uses a great many words thus pronounced. Both authors are 
quoting mispronunciation of local dialect. 
elm helm prism baptism rhythm 
film overwhelm chasm patriotism spasm 
The Letter r Should be Clearly Pronounced 
When telegraph messages are taken over the telephone, the 
operator is instructed to repeat the number containing the word 
“three” with the r strongly trilled, that there may be no possi- 
bility of mistaking the word and causing an error in an important 
message. : 
In certain regions of our country, r is trilled so that it sounds 
almost like a burr, while in others it is omitted, as when farm 
is pronounced as if spelled fahm. The latter pronunciation is, of 
course, incorrect. 
Watch the speech of your own class to learn whether the r is 
correctly spoken. Make lists of words to test this.

Intermediate and Obscure Vowel Sounds in Final Syllables 
Accenting words means that the accented syllable is clearly 
spoken; but we slip over or elide the unaccented syllable. This 
causes much confusion in syllables ending in 1, n, or r. 
In some cases the elision of the vowel sound is complete, as in 
evil, shovel. The Dictionary indicates this by using the apos- 
trophe in respelling; ev’l, shov’l. 
Pay careful attention to all final unaccented syllables. Study 
the following words. See how the Dictionary indicates the pronun- 
ciation of each word. Spell, and use in sentences 
bushel equal able alter similar 
nickel legal angle border altar

A Hint to the Class 
Correct Pronunciation can be gained best in class, when everybody 
takes part, and carefully notes pronunciation. Frank credit should 
be given for plain and correct pronunciation, and equally frank 
criticism of faulty speaking. 
Many students are already accustomed to the various sounds, 
and speak clearly. They can therefore help the class, including 
particularly those who are unaccustomed to Sound-Analysis. Since 
indistinct pronunciation and confusion of sounds prevent correct 
spelling, this practice is of great importance. 
Watch the progress of the class, therefore, and help all you can.

  The Class Exercise may be a test of skill, affording practice in 
some essential phase of spelling, and at the same time showing 
what knowledge or skill must be gained by the class. 
  Words 
which are usually confused, like weigh, way; angle, angel; coarse, 
course, may be cited, used in various illustrations contributed by 
the class and mastered; while those already familiar will be noted 
and passed by. 
Such lessons result in added skill, and greater familiarity with 
forms hitherto troublesome; while many students learn from the 
exercise that they must train themselves further in some particular 
direction.

The Class Exercise may have for its object investigation of a 
custom of English spelling. For instance, the class may follow 
up the letter combination ie to learn in what group of words 
it occurs, and whether the ei group is more common. The 
common experience of the class must be drawn upon and words 
contributed by the class. The lengthening of one list far be- 
yond the other proves the truth which is sought. 
Such an exercise has great value. It should precede assigned 
individual exercises. In fact, these assigned exercises should vary 
according to the needs brought out in the class exercise.

The Word All and Its Compounds 
The word all, in compounds, loses the final 1. This occasions 
misspelling, both in the words where two I’s are inserted by 
mistake, and also when words which should be separated are 
written as one word. 
Are you ready to go? Yes, we are all ready. All right, then. 
All aboard! Hurry up, John! You are almost left behind. The 
conductor has already called the train. You are altogether too 
slow, and always behindhand. 
Study every use of the word all, and give close attention to the 
various compounds in which the word loses the final 1. Distinguish 
between the separate words and the derivatives. 
Contractions: Spoken and Written 
When any part of a word is omitted in speaking, the written 
form of the spoken word shows this omission by using an apos- 
trophe, in the place of the letter or letters omitted. This short- 
ened form of the word is called a contraction. 
The word not is often shortened in speech, the vowel being 
omitted. We therefore commonly use the following contrac- 
tions: isn’t, hasn’t, didn’t, don’t, haven’t, aren’t, won’t, wouldn’t, 
shouldn’t, couldn’t. These contractions plainly show their origin, 
with the exception of won’t, which means will not. 
The words am, is, and are are often shortened in the same way, 
the vowel being elided: 
I’m going to Boston. Who’s there? 
We’re having a party. He’s afraid. 
Yow’re in a hurry, aren’t you? They’re looking for you. 
Use in séntences all the contractions referred to above. Make a 
list in your notebook of the contractions ordinarily used. 
The list which reviews ordinary contractions can best be 
composed by the class, with exercises for occasional dictation. 
  
To omit the apostrophe in the contraction is to misspell the word.

Verbs as Base-Words 
The suffix er, meaning ‘‘ one who” 
The suffix er, when it means “ one who,” is always added to a 
verb. Examples are: make, maker; love, lover; rob, robber; lose, 
loser; hunt, hunter. 
Make, in class, lists of words which illustrate such derivatives. 
Group the words according to the custom of spelling which they 
illustrate. Show how each nown maintains the meaning of the verb.

Using the Dictionary: The Meaning of Words 
The Dictionary shows the meaning of the word in four 
different ways. 
1. It presents the early history of the word with its 
meaning as it has changed through the years, and in the 
different languages through which it came into English. 
In other words, it shows the derivation of the word. 
2. It gives the definition of the word, which is a clear 
statement of its meaning. A word sometimes has many 
definitions according to its different uses. 
3. It illustrates the various uses of the word, with quo- 
tations from well-known writers whose use of the English 
language is approved. 
4, It names synonyms, other words which have nearly 
the same meaning, and which may sometimes be substi- 
tuted for the word which is defined. 
As soon as we take advantage of these helps we begin to 
enjoy using the Dictionary. 
Ignorance of the meaning of the word is one of the 
chief causes of misspelling. This can be cured only by 
greater familiarity with the word, and more constant use, 
in reading, speaking and writing. The reading habit in 
the end conquers poor spelling, for it makes the essential 
words familiar and fixes their form. 
  Knowing the meaning of the word is an essential part of learn- 
ing to spell. The words which really belong to us and which, 
therefore, we may freely use in writing, are those whose meaning 
we clearly understand. 
Take pains to study the meaning of new words which you 
hear spoken, or meet in reading. Then use them.

Word-Groups for Study and Spelling 
Interpreted, and Used in Sentences 
The word-groups in the following pages should be discussed, 
studied, memorized, and spelled. Both meaning and form should 
be clearly understood. Every student should use the words 
freely, composing his own sentences. He should be able to write 
the illustrative sentences from the text, on dictation, or to make 
his own sentence, promptly, when challenged. The Dictionary 
should be in constant use. 
Most words have many meanings. The Century Dictionary 
gives three columns of its large page to definitions and uses of the 
familiar word high. The following exercises illustrate one mean- 
ing only, to start discussion. The Dictionary, and your own habit 
of speech, will suggest other meanings or uses of each word. By 
such discussion and illustration, make the word your own and 
adopt it into your vocabulary, to be at your service. 
The words needed in everyday recitations in the various 
High School subjects, may be dealt with in the same way. This 
treatment of Word Study is meant to be suggestive and typical, 
but not final. Extend it to other groups. Do not waste time 
with single words; master the group. 
Do not attempt the study of too many groups in a lesson; rather, 
learn all that you can about a common group and be sure that the words 
are mastered in form, pronunciation, and meaning. A brief oral test 
may come at the end of the class period. 
  
The Spoken Word is a marvelous thing. A mere quiver of 
the air, it is, — passed on from speaker to hearer, millions of 
times, through generation after generation. We go our way, 
but the word survives with its meaning. Frail and unnoticed, 
it is,— but mighty; for in it and behind it is the Mind of 
Man.

or preceded, is a precedent. We speak of establishing a precedent 
when we set up something which may become an example.

oc-ca'sion oc-ca’sioned oc-ca’sion-al oc-ca’sion-al-ly 
Occasion may be a noun or a verb. (The verb to occasion means 
to cause.) 
The accident occasioned great excitement. His conduct occa- 
stoned grave anxiety. 
A special event may be spoken of as an occasion. An event is 
occasional when it happens now and then, or occasionally. 
per-form! per-form’ing per-form’er per-form’ance 
To perform an act is to accomplish that thing, or to fulfil a duty. 
The word is principally used in reference to actors on the stage, 
who perform their part. They are called performers, and the play is 
a performance. Anyone who performs is a performer and the thing 
done is a performance. 
pos-sess’ pos-sess'ing pos-ses’sor pos-ses’sion 
To possess is to have and to hold. One may possess a farm or 
automobile, or the affection of his friends. In that case he is the 
possessor of these things; all these are his possessions. 
Possess sometimes means to take possession and obtain or main- 
tain, as ‘‘ to possess one’s soul in patience.” 
pre-fer’ pre-ferred’ pre-fer’ring pref’er-ence 
To prefer is to place one thing in advance of another, or to think 
more highly of it. 
“T prefer mathematics to history; Jane’s preference is art.” ‘In 
preferring work to play, John is like his family.” 
(Note the change of accent and the single r in preference.) 
de-fer’ de-ferred’ de-fer’ring def’er-ence 
To defer is to put off or postpone. The picnic was deferred on 
account of the weather. 
One may defer to the judgment or wishes of another. This is 
really a totally different meaning, and the two words defer have dif- 
ferent histories. (See derivation.) Def’er-ence belongs to the second 
verb only. It implies respect for the judgment of another.

grief grieve griev'ing griev'ous 
Grief usually means distress or mental suffering occasioned by 
sorrow or deep anxiety. The verb grieve was derived originally from 
a word meaning heavy. We grieve a friend when we cause him 
sorrow or wound his feelings. That which causes sorrow or weighs 
one down with anxiety is grievous.

oc cur’ oc curred’ oc cur’ring oc cur’rence 
Occurring used to mean running against, or clashing (see derivation). 
It now means merely to be in one’s mind, as “‘ It occurred to me ”; 
or, merely, to happen. Occurred is more formal than happened, but 
that which happens is called an occurrence. 
prin’ci ple un prin’ci pled prin’ci pal prin’ci pal ly 
Principle is a noun always, but a person who is not guided by 
principles or laws is called unprincipled. Principal may be a noun, 
as ‘“‘the principal of the school’’; or an adjective, meaning leading 
or chief, as, ‘‘It was the principal event of the day.” Principally 
means chiefly. 
Associate principal with leadership or importance; principle with 
law and truth. These words are often misunderstood and therefore 
used incorrectly. : 
(Use them in many relations and in clear sentences until they are 
familiar. The final syllables should not be pronounced alike. In 
principle, the e is elided; in principal the final vowel is obscure a.) 
pre pare’ prepar’ing pre par’a to ry prep a ra’tion 
To prepare is to make ready. One who is making ready is pre- 
paring. That which is done in preparation for anything is said to be 
preparatory; and that which prepares an individual, as for example 
a school, may also be called preparatory.

There will be a picnic by the lake near the village; all the people 
thereabout will come. Jack was lame and, therefore, could not join in 
the game. He told me all the whys and wherefores, for he thoroughly 
understood the matter. Where could one find James? Do you know 
his whereabouts ? 
Thereabout and whereabouts are common examples of compound 
words which have grown up by adding one word to another. The 
word is in itself a phrase. Therefore and wherefore are less notice- — 
able, but follow the same habit of growing languages.

Each of these four words is likewise compounded of two words. 
We forget that the words were ever separated and think of them, 
always as one.

One meaning of policy is the plan or organization accepted by a 
group or an individual; it applies also to the course chosen and 
adopted by an individual or a group. To understand the policies of 
a government is to know political science, or the science and art of 
government. This may be called politics in the true sense. 
A politician is one devoted to politics. In the finer sense of the 
word, this means a statesman.

de ceive’ re ceive’ con ceive’ per ceive’ 
These four words with their derivatives are the essential words in 
which the phonogram cei (pronounced sé) is found. They are all 
derived from the same Latin root, meaning to take, which comes to 
us from the French (capere, to take). 
(If the entire group is mastered, with the word ceiling, there is 
no need of a rule for ei after c. Look up all four .words in the 
Dictionary, to learn their exact derivation.) 
To deceive is to state or pretend something which is not true, 
causing another to believe something which is false. To conceive is 
to take into one’s mind some thought or idea. To perceive is to see or 
understand; to take into and through one’s mind. To receive is 
to take, to accept, that which comes, or is paid, or is sent. 
I received your letter. His plausible story completely deceived 
me. The architect conceived the plan of the cathedral. He perceived 
that he had blundered. 
de ceit’ con ceit’ re ceipt’ per ceiv'ing 
Deceit implies the intention to deceive; it is a trick which misleads 
another. A receipt is a written assurance that something has been 
received. (Observe the unusual silent p.) Conceit originally meant 
the conceiving, or that which was conceived. It now applies to con- 
ceiving one’s self as better than he is, and implies vanity. “His 
self-conceit is astonishing.” 
Perceiving is the present participle of perceive. ‘‘ Perceiving his 
error, he corrected it.” 
Te cep’tion de cep’tion per ception con cep'tion 
Reception is the act of receiving. The word is frequently applied 
to an occasion where many persons are greeted or received. Deception 
is the act of deceiving; conception is the act of conceiving, or that 
which is conceived. Perception is the act of perceiving. 
This is the maker’s conception of a beautiful and useful chair. 
His clear perception of conditions made his advice valuable. 
This group of words clearly shows how the Latin root, coming 
through the French, has become necessary to our everyday speech in 
many ways.

agitated. A committee may become agitated in discussion. 
ar’gue ar’gu ing ar’gu ment ar’gu men’ta tive 
To argue is to present reasons for and against the fact or principle

truth without arousing feeling. 
char’ac ter char’ac ter ize char’ac ter is’ tic 
Character (from the Greek) may mean a sign or symbol, as in 
shorthand; it may stand for personality, indicating good qualities;

is to set forth the qualities or character of a person, event or thing. 
con sid’er con sid’ered con sid’er a bly con sid er a’tion 
To consider meant in the beginning to look at and to study the 
stars. This was deliberate and long continued. Consideration

reasons both for and against. In discussion one distinguishes quali- 
ties and attempts to set forth the truth which is being discussed.

ap point’ ap point’ed dis ap point’ dis ap point’ment 
To appoint is to point out or designate a person, time or place. 
One keeps his appointment when he comes at the appointed time.

live up to expectations. (See derivation.) 
ap pear’ ap pear’ance dis ap pear’ dis ap pear’ance 
To appear is to come into view, as “The train appeared around the 
curve.” Or, it means simply to seem, as “He appears worn and 
weary.” This is the sense in which we use appearance. We judge 
by “appearances.” Or, it mearis merely the act of appearing, as 
“The appearance of the teacher ended the game.” 
To disappear is to retire from view; disappearance is the going 
out of sight. 
(Remember the pp in spelling these words and their derivatives.) 
com mit’ com mit’ted com mit'tee com mis'sion 
To commit is to give in trust; or to do; or to pledge one’s self.

care of the state’s prison. The question will be decided by the school 
committee, to whom the care of the schools is committed. 
com pel’ com pelled’ com pul’sion com pul’so ry 
To compel another is to force him to do something; one is com- 
pelled to yield. Compulsion (derived from the past participle of 
the same verb) makes the act compelling. A compulsory law is one 
which compels obedience. We speak of compulsory attendance at 
school, — the attending under compulsion. 
com pete’ com pet’ing com’pe tent com pe ti’tion 
To compete is to strive or seek for something which others also are 
striving to gain. One becomes competent as he proves himself suc- 
cessful in such competition. Competent, however, loses the sense of 
strife in a race with others. Its synonyms are adequate, capable, 
sufficient, qualified, or fit, An examination may be competitive.

for'mer ly for'mal ly sta’tion er y sta’tion a ry 
These words are never confused in reading, nor even in writing, 
when their true meaning is remembered. In reading, the context 
suggests the meaning. Former and latter are opposites. Formal 
and informal have opposite meanings. 
“ At the formal dinner everyone was formally introduced.” “ For- 
mal is according to form; adhering to form.” 
“Tn former days the children attended the district school.” 
One stands well in the community; he keeps his station or standing. 
A thing is stationary when it does not move, but keeps its place. 
Both root and suffix, in stationary, have the same vowel, a. 
“The stationer sells books, papers, envelopes, which are the sta- 
tioner’s goods, or stationery.” (Remember, the stationer owns his 
stationer-y.) 
change’ chang’ing changed change’a ble 
ex change’ ex chang’ing ex changed’ ex change’a ble 
These words illustrate soft g as the final sound of the root. This 
softness is indicated and maintained by the presence of silent e.

store are not exchangeable. The winds are changeable, blowing from 
both south and west. His mind is constantly changing.

Relation also means the act of relating or reporting. 
Words are related to one another in the sentence; prepositions 
indicate such relations.

CLASS EXERCISE: The Meaning of Words 
Synonyms 
A synonym is one of two or more words which have the same 
or nearly the same essential meaning. If a word has many mean- 
ings, there may be another word in the language for each meaning. 
A person may be called dull, and the synonym chosen may be 
stupid. But when a knife is dull, this synonym is not used. 
You will find in the Dictionary the many synonyms which 
may be substituted for a word, each in its own place. 
Use in sentences the synonyms of the following groups. Point 
out any difference in meaning or in use. . 
Copy in your notebooks ten new words met in your daily work 
or reading, and find synonyms for them. Report to the ‘class for 
discussion and criticism. 
add; attach, enlarge, increase 
abitle; dwell, remain, reside 
allow; admit, tolerate, consent to 
business; affair, commerce, work 
calm; cool, peaceful, still 
catch; capture, secure, seize 
cease; conclude, end, finish 
circumstance; event, fact, item 
danger; hazard, peril, risk 
desire; craving, longing, wish 
displace; confuse, disturb, mislay 
do; accomplish, finish, transact 
draw; drag, haul, pull 
endure; bear, permit, tolerate 
faithful; devoted, loyal, true 
A Synonym is not a definition, but it helps 
to show the meaning of words.

Know the meaning of words, and in the company in which 
they belong,’ that is, in sentences. Using the word makes it 
yours. You become used to it both in speech and in reading, 
and it remains yours when you write, when you really spell for 
a purpose. You will repeat its true form, spelling correctly, if 
you are used to it. Use the words which give you trouble. 
Words are tools. 
Skill in the use of tools comes only through practice.

CLASS EXERCISE: The Habits of e Silent 
Silent e usually shows that the preceding vowel is long, as 
in came, home. (Sometimes, however, the vowel is short; bade, 
olive, promise, facile.) 
Silent e may show that the preceding c or g is soft: service, 
damage; or it follows s, z or th when in unusual final positions, 
or when it is needed to distinguish a noun from a verb: wreath, 
wreathe; pleas, please; squeeze. 
E is sometimes silent in the ed of the past tense, as dreamed, 
hoped, stopped, offered. This occurs when the final consonant of 
the base easily blends with final d. 
Find examples of these uses of silent e. 
Silent e, Final or Maintained in Derivative 
Study the list, observing not only the final e, but the vowel and 
consonant preceding it. Match each word when you can with 
another word which rhymes with it. Watch to see whether every 
rhyme also contains the silent final e. Spell the words and use 
them in sentences. : 
wrote safe passed huge supplies 
whole safety ordered hugely severe 
used raise once hoarse while 
tired raised none horse phrase 
      
stayed phrase mere welfare done     some service merely farewell scrape 
since seized like dropped immense 
sense scheme likely choice severely     
Double e is usually equivalent to @, except as in the words 
breeches, been, and coffee, in which it has the sound of short i.

Customs in Writing Syllables 
CLASS EXERCISE: for Discussion and Practice 
When it is necessary to divide a word at the end of a line, it 
should always be separated between syllables. 
If the word has one syllable only it must not be divided; it 
is better not to divide a short word at the end of a ie, even if 
it has two syllables. 
The double consonant coming between two vowels is separated 
in syllabication, one consonant being attached to each syllable: 
ap-ple; man-ner; tun-nel; stop-ping; hol-low. 
The rule just stated applies also when two different consonants 
come between two vowels: Muil-ton; sel-dom; cor-ner. But no 
digraph is ever divided: stock-ing, with-out. 
When it is necessary to preserve the meaning or sense of the 
base, this separation of the two consonants is not made. Horn y, 
brown ish, self ish, are examples. 
Ordinarily, a single consonant between two vowels is attached 
to the first syllable if the preceding vowel is short; to the last 
syllable if the preceding vowel is long. 
Monosyllables are never divided at the end of a line. One 
often thinks of the ending ed in one syllable words as an addi- 
tional syllable and making a division, for this is a suffix. But 
words like beamed, closed, blazed, dreamed, etc., are still mono- 
syllables in spite of their termination, and must not be divided. 
Separate these words into syllables, applying the appropriate rules. 
advice something economy deceive consider 
almost strengthen volunteer desperate discover 
already substitute sympathy desperation discovery 
scissors exhibition tenant definite peaceable 
scenery expectation tendency definitely changeable 
  
In writing, indicate the division into syllables by the hyphen, 
used at the end of the first line, but never on the following line.

Abbreviations 
CLASS EXERCISE: For Reading, Discussion, and Illustration 
To abbreviate is to shorten. In spelling, abbreviation means 
the shortened form of a word. In titles or addresses, the shortened 
form is frequently used, as, for example, Dr. for Doctor; Mr. 
for Mister; Jr. for Junior. 
In a list of proper names, as in a telephone directory, the 
initial of the middle name is used to save space, and sometimes 
the first name is abbreviated. These shortened forms are often 
used to save time, but it is usually better to write the name in 
full whenever this can reasonably be done. In personal letters, 
abbreviations should be rarely used. 
The entire name of the State, written plainly in address- 
ing an envelope, may prevent the letter from going to New 
Mexico instead of New Hampshire, or New Jersey instead of 
New York. 
It is always right to abbreviate the titles written Mr., Mrs., 
Messrs., or Saint in a proper name (as St. John, St. Clair), 
and to use the initial only of the middle name, in an address. 
In business writing the sign (&) may be used for the word and, 
while in business letters or statements the abbreviations of com- 
mercial lists or statements will be used. 
With these exceptions there are three invariable rules for 
writing abbreviations. 
  1. A period must be used after every abbreviation or initial used 
as an abbreviation. This is a part of the spelling. 
2. The abbreviation of a proper name or title is always capitalized. 
(Mr. Jas. K. Jones, Jr.) 
3. Abbreviations should be avoided, if possible, in personal letters, 
with the exceptions named above.

Rules for the Use of Capital Letters 
Names of persons and places must begin with a capital letter. 
This applies to a particular name, as Mary, Boston; not a general 
name, as woman, city. In other words, proper nouns begin with 
capital letters. 
Every sentence begins with a capital letter. 
The important words of a title, as of a book, article, or story, 
must begin with a capital letter. 
; Boys of Today, the Men of Tomorrow; Spending the 
Winter with Grenfell in Labrador; Why. Everybody 
Should Learn to Swim. 
The abbreviation of proper names, or titles used in names, 
should begin with a capital. (Mr. Chas. E. Smith.) 
All initials should be written in capitals, in proper names. 
The letters used for Roman numerals are usually written in 
capitals. 
In addressing a letter use no punctuation except the periods 
required after the abbreviation, or initial. But every word of 
the address (except prepositions or conjunctions, and the adjec- 
tive the) must begin with a capital letter. 
The words J and O should always be written as capital letters. 
Every line of poetry should begin with a capital letter. 
Adjectives derived from names of places or persons should 
begin with a capital letter. 
The name God should be written with a capital letter. 
The use of capital letters and punctuation marks in letter 
writing is illustrated in a following section.
-P-A-G-E-150
138 
Rules of Punctuation 
Marks of punctuation are used merely to make the meaning of 
the sentence plain. They should be used only when needed. 
The marks most commonly used are the period (.), the comma 
(,), the interrogation point (?), the exclamation point (!), the 
semicolon (;), the colon (:), the apostrophe (’), the hyphen 
(-), the dash (—), and the parenthesis ( ). 
A period must be used at the end of every declarative or im- 
perative sentence, and after every abbreviation. 
The interrogation point must be written at the end of every 
question. 
The exclamation point follows the interjection, or the exclama- 
tory phrase standing alone, and the exclamatory sentence. 
The comma separates words in a series, and is written after 
every word of the series except the last. 
Examples: I saw James, John, Kate, and Mary at the picnic. 
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the rights of every 
citizen. 
The comma encloses a parenthetical phrase; that is, one which 
breaks the thought or is thrown in. 
Example: Your brother, I mean James, wishes to speak to you. 
The comma separates phrases or clauses which are not very 
closely connected in thought, and which need to be observed as 
separate groups. The use of the comma in your writing depends 
upon the emphasis which you wish to give. 
Examples: The books in the library are mine. The books, in the 
library only, are mine.

The semicolon is used between clauses, if no conjunction is 
used. 
Example: ‘Children had come from all quarters, they hurried in 
after school; they left their games and sports; they came in groups 
and in crowds; all wanted to be there.” 
The semicolon is used like the comma in the series, except 
that the parts separated are the major parts of the sentence. 
The colon precedes a list or an example, or it separates the 
parts of a long sentence, usually codrdinate. 
Examples: 
These words are nouns: John, James, boy, girl. 
The interrogation point is made like this: (?). 
They roused the village; they sounded the fire alarm; they sent 
messengers from house to house; they used every possible means to 
find the missing child: but in vain. 
The apostrophe indicates the omission of a letter in contrac- 
tions, and it is also the sign of the possessive case. 
Example: “ This isn’t my book; it is John’s.” 
The hyphen indicates the separation of syllables, or the parts 
of a compound word. When a word is divided at the end of a 
line, in writing, the hyphen is always used. 
The dash sometimes follows the comma, or takes the place of 
the marks of parenthesis. It should be seldom used. 
Example: I dread,— am afraid,— to go. 
Marks of parenthesis set off an inserted phrase, usually ex- 
planatory. 
Examples: “I came Wednesday, (you had invited me), but found 
no one at home.” “Marks of Punctuation (the period, comma, etc.) 
are intended to make the meaning clear.”

LETTER WRITING 
Arrangement and Punctuation 
Spelling is chiefly required in writing letters. The letter is 
merely a written message. It should be clearly stated, correctly 
spelled, and should follow the accepted forms of letter writing. 
Every letter should show clearly the place where it is written, 
the date of writing, the name and address of the person to whom 
written and the name or signature of the writer. 
The place and date constitute the Heading of the letter; the 
Beginning, or Salutation, names the person to whom it is written; 
then follows the Message with a Friendly or Formal and Courteous 
Closing; then the Signature. 
Friendly letters may vary very much in the freedom of form; 
but business letters carefully follow the accepted forms. 
The Heading contains the name of the state, the town or city, 
and if necessary, the name of the street with the house number. 
This is followed by the date. The accepted form of punctuation 
of the Heading is indicated in the examples given: 
Examples of Headings 
Hopedale, Illinois Boston, Massachusetts 
June 16, 1923 April 13, 1923 
Fairfield Hospital 110 East Street 
Oldtown, Maine Alton, Illinois 
March 19, 1923 June 5, 1923

Springvale 1755 Maple Avenue 
Kansas Springfield, Ohio
-P-A-G-E-153

In a business letter, the complete address of the person to whom 
the letter is written may follow the heading. However, many 
writers prefer to place this business address at the end of the 
letter after the signature of the writer, but on the left side of 
page. Following are examples of headings and salutations for 
business letters, using the open form of punctuation. 
Smith, Brown and Company Miss L. K. Dodge 
35 Nassau Street Smith Publishing Company 
Dallas, Texas Topeka, Kansas 
My dear Sirs, My dear Miss Dodge, 
Messrs. King, Blake and Company President Lawrence Lowell 
39 Broad Street Harvard University 
Louisville, Kentucky Cambridge, Massachusetts 
Gentlemen, My dear Sir, 
Both the Salutation and the Ending of the letter are followed by the 
comma. The Signature requires no punctuation except the period 
after any initial. 
  Examples of Salutations 
   
    
   My dear cousin, Dear Sir, 
Dear cousin, My dear Sir, 
Dear old Jack, Dear Madam, 
My long-neglected brother, My dear Madam, 
Dear Joe, Dear Mr. King, 
My good friend, My dear Mrs. King, 
  “My dear Mrs. King” is more formal than “Dear Mrs. King.”

   The forms given above will serve as a foundation 
for ordinary writing. As you become familiar with 
well written letters, you will recognize possible varia- 
tions in arrangement. But the rules for punctuation 
and capitals must be adhered to, and variation from 
the forms should come only after actual experience 
with excellent types in genuine correspondence.

SUMMARY OF HELPS TO PRONUNCIATION 
I, DIACRITICAL MARKS 
As Used in Webster’s International Dictionary 
In the English language there are more than forty sounds, 
but in the alphabet there are only twenty-six letters. 
Since all the sounds must be represented ‘by these twenty-six 
letters, it is often necessary to add some sign to show exactly 
what sound is indicated. Every vowel stands for several sounds. 
Diacritical marks are used to show which sound of a letter is 
intended. These marks are in constant use in the Dictionary. 
1. Diacritical Marks Used With Vowels 
Macron: cane, méte, pine, note, cube, fly 
Breve: cdn, mét, pin, not, ctib, baby 
Tilde: hér, girl, work 
Circumflex: cdre, cérn, carl 
Two dots above the letter: stdr, machine 
Two dots beneath the letter: wall, June, move 
One dot above the letter: fast, son 
One dot below the letter: wolf, push 
Apostrophe for omitted vowel: ev’n 
2. Diacritical Marks Used With Consonants 
s (=z) is marked g: has 
x (= gz) is marked x: egist 
c (=s) is marked ¢: cent 
ch ( = sh) is marked ch: maghine 
th (subvocal) is marked th: this 
g (= j) is marked g: ginger 
n (= ng) is marked n: ink

IV. Marks Used with Obscure Vowels in Unaccented Syllables 
In unaccented syllables, short Italian a is obscure in sound. 
This is identified in the Dictionary by using italics with the same 
mark as that of the clear sound (dsleep). 
The long vowel sound is more or less obscured in unaccented 
syllables, and is somewhat shortened. This halfway sound is 
indicated by a line over the macron (senate, library, évent, péetic, 
dbey, tnite). 
The short vowel in a final unaccented syllable, as final, novel, 
comet, is somewhat obscured. It retains its mark, the breve, 
but it is written in italics to indicate the loss of force and clear- 
ness; (findl, novél, circtis). 
All vowels are somewhat obscure in unaccented syllables 
The Dictionary marks only extreme and regular cases of obscure 
vowels; but ordinary pronounciation may greatly obscure the vowel 
of any unaccented syllable. 
Unaccented syllables therefore become a source of many errors 
in spelling. 
Carefully study every word to detect and observe the wnaccented 
vowels. A list of words is given below. 
Examples of Vowels in Unaccented Syllables 
sugar sentence separate 
secret distance appetite 
honest difference blizzard 
organ silence elevate 
eleven furnace magazine 
equal gallant palaces 
voyage private salaries 
intimate balance celery 
imitate current misery 
excavate currant gallery

Rules of Spelling: Foundation Stones 
The major rules of spelling centre about four distinct 
difficulties of English spelling, which are readily over- 
come if clearly recognized. 
1. The habit of silent e, final, or in a final syllable. 
2. The customs of the vowel y, when final. 
8. The sound of soft c and of soft g with their relation 
to e andi. 
4. The doubled consonant. 
Studies of the misspellings which occur reveal the reasons 
for selecting the wrong form. The chief reason is the 
failure to bring to the forefront of the mind the groups 
affected by these major rules of spelling. 
Attend to these stumbling blocks, then. Why not make them 
the Foundation Stones of Good Spelling? 
Words Containing Silent e 
Observe the silent e in both roots and derivatives; note also when 
it is dropped. Spell each word and use tt in a sentence. 
safe amuse invade divide relate 
safety amusing invading dividing elating 
safely amusement invasion division elation 
wise grateful complete endure include 
wisely _ gratefully completely enduring including 
wisdom gratitude completion endurance inclusive 
Make similar lists to illustrate the four ‘Foundation Stones.” 
Recall and state the rules.

  151 
CLASS EXERCISE 
The Syllable in Spelling: For Discussion and: Illustration 
The syllable is your major unit in correct spelling; your 
stumbling block when you misspell. You do not misspell the 
entire word, having no single letter in its right place. Ordinarily 
it is a single syllable that causes your downfall. 
Sometimes it is the accented syllable, with a vowel digraph 
hiding a silent letter, where you hear only a long vowel sound; 
(pain’ful). Or perhaps you retain the silent letter which should 
be dropped, as in the word judgment, often misspelled. 
Sometimes it is the syllable.in which the unusual silent letter 
chooses to camp and stay; (neigh’bor). 
Often, it is the unaccented syllable, with its obscure vowel; 
(sep’a rate). Chiefly, it is the behaviour of the final syllable, 
especially when it becomes joined to a suffix; (die, dy’ing). 
And again, it is the extra syllable, which loves to slip in, con- 
fusing the spelling, as in the much abused “ ath(a)letics.” Except 
for the intruder, the word is spelled right. 
Build lists of words on the blackboard, suggested by the class, 
illustrating these truths. The words may be taken from any text- 
book used by the class; or from the ordinary speaking vocabulary; 
or from the lists of misspelled words in the exercise books. 
  
It is clear that we must redouble our attention to the accented 
syllables; fo the final syllables; and to the lightly spoken and 
frequently elided unaccented syllable; and we must exclude 
positively the extra syllable that will creep in, if we hear words 
mispronounced, and fail to pay attention. 
When you learn that you have spelled a word incorrectly, 
look at once to see where you failed, and why. Then fix in your 
mind at once the right form and sound, and repeat it whenever 
you have a spare minute, until you have mastered it.
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 
Double Letters: A Common Cause for Misspelling 
The doubled letters, particularly the doubled consonant, provide 
a double cause for misspelling. If one of the letters is omitted, 
the word is wrong; it is also wrong if the letter is doubled when 
it should be single. 
It is worth while to search for the types of words in which 
the doubled consonant occurs. We may learn to avoid the 
trouble. 
Three distinct groups of words contain the doubled conso- 
nant, each for a different reason. 
1. Certain consonants are doubled when following a vowel 
at the end of a monosyllable. 
skiff buzz full quill burr fuss 
snuff fuzz knoll small whirr pass 
When these monosyllables take a suffix, in forming a derivative, 
the doubled consonant remains; it was inherited, so to speak. 
Remember, then, that the final doubled consonant of the mono- 
syllable is retained in the derivative. 
2. We know that when the base ends in a single consonant, 
preceded by a single vowel, the consonant is doubled before a 
suffix beginning with a vowel. 
drop hat glad whip rob red 
dropping hatter gladden whipping robbery reddish 
The same is true when the phonogram occurs at the end of 
an accented syllable (final) in the base. 
occur admit permit combat regret control 
occurred admitted permitting combatted regretting controlled 
  
Make a study of doubled consonants, showing, as you list them 
in your notebook, that certain groups of words have acquired this 
element in a certain way.
-P-A-G-E-165
  153 
3. When the Prefix Causes the Doubled Consonant 
The prefix may be attached to the word without change, as 
in outside, outermost, understand, unlike. Or, it may change 
its final consonant so that it may be more easily spoken in com- 
bination with the initial letter of the root. 
The prefix ad often combines with the initial. letter of the 
sound which is easiest to speak. Jllegal, which means not legal 
(in-legal), is made in this way. The sound which is usually 
taken is that of the initial letter, and the consonant is thus 
doubled, as in the following examples. 
accept accuse accustom _ arrogant 
affirm allege appetite ammunition 
Spell and use in sentences the following words. Show the meaning 
of the prefix, and point out any change in it. 
accept attack account accommodate 
accuse attempt assistant accomplish 
affairs attract accident accustom 
affect arrange aggravate acknowledge 
appoint address accurate aggression 
appear acquaint associate ammunition 
Look after your prefix and see what happens to it when it 
is placed before different consonants. Do not confuse ad words 
beginning with ad (or a modified ad), with those which begin 
with obscure a standing alone; as about. Give a clearer sound, 
approaching short a, to the prefix vowel, and dwell more upon 
the sound of the consonant. 
  
ad muse’; but de cuse’ achieve’; but de quaint’ 
ad round’; but dc count’ alert’; but dl low’

Doubling Consonants When the Prefix is Added 
Adding the prefix doubles the initial consonant of the root, 
in the following verbs. 
Study, spell, and use in sentences each word of the list. 
Write for each verb the present, past tense, and past participle. 
Account for the doubled consonant. 
appoint accept allow supply 
appear accuse allies suggest 
approach accustom arrange succeed 
apparent accord arrive success 
annex account assist suffix 
  
If a word does not belong to your own vocabulary, the way to 
make it your own is to use it often in senfences. Compose many 
sentences clearly spoken and well written, for each new word.

For Discussion 
WHY LEARN TO SPELL: THE REPLY 
My words are my own, to say what I think; to speak or 
to write what I choose to speak or write. 
But others hear what I say, and see what I write; my 
speech concerns others. 
I need to understand what they speak or write; 
I must know how to make them understand my words. 
Therefore I must be able to speak clearly, pronounce 
rightly, spell correctly, and use words with their true 
meaning. 
This is a lifelong study, which calls for a keen mind, alert 
attention, seeing eyes, hearing ears, and joy in under- 
standing. But words shall become my tools and shall 
enable me to express my thoughts clearly, and to under- 
stand what others have to say to me. 
I must undertake for myself, and must carry on, the 
Mastery of Words. 
THE TEST: Learn by Heart 
To be able to pronounce all the words one wishes to use, 
clearly and rightly, so that they may be easily heard 
and plainly understood; 
To write with ease and accuracy the vocabulary that sets 
forth what one thinks and wishes to express, out of 
his own growing and changing experience; 
To add, habitually and with ease, new words as they are needed, 
and without further instruction; 
This means the Mastery of Words.

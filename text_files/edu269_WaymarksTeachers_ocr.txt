GREETING. 
  N the ever-to-be-remembered record of the experience 
of Christian and Hopeful in the dominion of Giant 
Despair, we read of their return to the King’s Highway, 
to the stile over which they had ventured into the en- 
ticing by-path. “Now, when they were gone over the 
stile, they began to contrive with themselves what they 
should do at that stile to prevent those that should 
come after from falling into the hands of Giant Despair. 
So they consented to erect there a pillar, and to en- 
grave upon the side thereof this sentence: ‘Over this 
stile is the way to Doubting Castle, which is kept by 
Giant Despair, who despiseth the King of the Celestial 
Country and seeks to destroy his holy pilgrims.’ Many 
therefore, that followed after, read what was written, 
and escaped the danger.” Thus the friendly waymark 
bestowed upon all who were able to “read what was 
written” the best fruit of the pilgrims’ experience. 
We like to think of the King’s Highway as safely 
hedged by such guides, and marked as well by signs of 
paths surely leading to the Beautiful Gate. But is it 
not true that our way is so marked? The experience

  of others in our common work is ever a waymark to 
guide all who are able to read what is written. The 
notes which follow are recorded in this hope, — that 
these fruits of every-day experience in every-day school- 
rooms may prove to some fellow-traveller helpful 
waymarks,

NATURE STUDY. 
I. PURPOSE AND PLAN. 
EFORE any work is outlined in the subject it will 
be well to state our motive in introducing nature 
study into the curriculum of our schools. No teaching 
can be definite unless the teacher is clear-sighted in her 
recognition of the purpose of her work. She should 
appreciate the one great motive in educating the child, 
and should realize in what measure the daily lessons 
of the school-room help to achieve this end. Nothing 
else helps so much to strip from the teacher’s methods 
the cumbersome crusts of custom, and to clear the way 
of the accumulated trash of random suggestion, leaving 
the path free for the steady, even march toward the 
one goal. Such recognition of the true end of teach- 
ing serves to sift all methods which are cried by hobby- 
riders or flung to the breeze by amateur experimen- 
talists. It tests the material brought forward to heap 
upon our course of study, and selects such method and 
such matter as must without fail give to the children 
the utmost help in reaching this mark that is set be- 
fore them. It is a magnet which draws to itself the 
appropriate means for instruction, and repels the worth- 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 NATURE STUDY. 
  less. It organizes the forces at our disposal, brings 
order out of chaos, simplicity out of multiplicity, har- 
mony out of conflict. By this overruling and dominat- 
ing purpose should the teacher’s work be judged, and 
only that which urges toward the chosen object be 
pronounced good. 
This purpose — we state it without attempt at argu- 
ment — is character-building, — developing in the child 
all powers which make him an upright, honorable, help- 
ful, and happy man, which will fit him to live well the 
life which is his, to run well the race which is set be- 
fore him. No lower aim will content a people who 
have declared their firm and abiding belief that all men 
are born free and equal, with an inalienable right to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. To fit the 
child to live a life worth living, to help himself and 
others to such living, to the fullest liberty, to the 
capacity for happiness and the means of securing it, 
—is not this the end of education? And is our school 
work in the right line if it does not do its part to help 
toward this end? Out of it must come greater power 
to think, and righteous thoughts; greater capacity for 
feeling, and sympathy with our brother's need; greater 
power of expression, because great thoughts and noble 
feelings demand expression; greater power to see, and 
to see the beautiful. We teach the child to add, sub- 
tract, multiply, and divide; and what avails it if he use 
his power to cheat his neighbor, and give false weight 
and measure? We teach him to calculate, to weigh 
values, to think with mathematical directness, and omit 
the training which would make these tools work for 
righteousness; and he has only become better able to 
scheme and plan for his own betterment and his neigh-
-P-A-G-E-11
  
PURPOSE AND PLAN. Ir 
  bor’s ruin. We teach him to read, without implanting 
in his soul such love of the good in literature that he 
will choose the good and no other, and we have opened 
for him doors into evil paths as well as good, without 
power to withstand the temptations of the one and to 
steadily pursue the other. We give him language 
power to express his thoughts; what thoughts? We 
train him to write — what ?. We would make his body 
strong and powerful; to what end? We would make 
him amenable to school discipline; and why? To 
what end shall we train eye and thought, heart and 
will? To what end shall we read and study and work 
with the most earnest endeavor and most thorough 
earnestness? To this end, and none lower: that we may 
help the children toward this ideal which we set before 
them, —a strong, wholesome, well-rounded life, worth 
the living for self and for others. 
And are we to do it all? No; no one of us is capa- 
ble of so much; but we are to take hold of hands with 
all who are working toward the same end, and to do our 
part. We cannot do it well unless we keep our eye on 
the goal, and so tend steadily toward it. 
Passing for the time the other means for development 
in our ordinary curriculum, let us turn at once to the 
nature study, and note its relation to the end which we 
have in view in our teaching. What has it to do with 
the well-being of the child? Does it properly belong 
in our course, judged by the standard which we have 
just accepted? 
One of the necessities of our life is knowledge of our 
environment. In this world of nature we are set to live 
our lives, among its trees and flowers, its rocks and rills, 
through its storm and shine, amidst its silent, eternal
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 NATURE STUDY. 
  forces. Upon its life does our physical life depend; 
with our apprehension of its laws and appreciation of its 
beauty is our spiritual life concerned. If the wheat 
ministers to our physical need and provides us food, 
none the less does the beauty of the growing grain 
satisfy the eye, and the truth of which the seed is a 
type feed the soul. The law which guides the moun- 
tain torrent in its course, moves the mighty glacier in 
its bed, or sows the fluttering seed of the maple, guides 
our steps. We battle with the storm on sea and land, 
and its strength becomes our own, —a part of muscle, 
nerve, and sinew, as well as of heart. We share with 
grass and flowers the blessing of the sunshine, and then, 
looking upon our friend of glad, joyous heart, say noth- 
ing better than this, ‘‘ His nature is sunny.” The high- 
est aspirations and convictions of the soul are spoken in 
terms of nature: “As the hart panteth after the water 
brooks, so panteth my soul for thee, O God.” “Thou 
art my Rock.” “Stormy wind fulfilling his word.” 
From earliest time has man, looking upon the face of 
nature, learned to see his Creator and read his laws. 
In no other way can we so well read the laws of life 
and love, and come to know “the Father of Lights, in 
whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” 
That the child may be reverent and upward-looking, 
and that he may come to know himself as subject to 
eternal laws, we would have him study nature. But 
this is not all, though it stands first among the many 
reasons for this training. The child’s “ pursuit of hap- 
piness” depends upon the power within him, the power 
to see and enjoy beauty. Holmes has said, ‘One must 
have the ocean in his soul if he would enjoy Nahant; 
he must have the mountains in his heart if he would

live in Berkshire.” Why could Wordsworth say of 
Peter Bell, — 
“ The primrose by the river’s brim 
A yellow primrose was to him, 
And it was nothing more” ? 
Because he had not primroses in his heart; because his 
eyes had never been opened to see the beautiful. Think 
how barren this world must be to such a man, — how 
limited his capacity for happiness, how narrow his liv- 
ing, — not because his work is common or his lot in 
life mean, but because his eyes are holden, so that 
he can not see the wonderful beauty that fills his path- 
way. How can we withhold from the children the 
training which will open their eyes to see, which will 
make the wilderness blossom as a rose, the “‘ mountains 
and hills break forth into singing”? Lessons which 
direct their attention to the wonders of the world about 
them, and lead them to love the beautiful therein dis- 
played, must increase their avenues of happiness, and 
enable them even through heaviest drudgery to make 
music in their hearts and to see the beautiful wherever 
they are placed. Such open vision should come from 
the nature study, — clear seeing, earnest thinking, rev- 
erent feeling. If these results do come, we must place 
nature study upon our list of essentials. What is essen. 
tial if these powers are not? 
The immediate ends in view in the nature lesson are 
observation, knowledge, expression, and enjoyment. 
The child should learn to see the plant or mineral 
clearly and to state truthfully what he has seen. He 
should learn to observe in an orderly manner, so that 
his observation may be complete. In order to obtain 
this result, he must develop through these lessons the
-P-A-G-E-14
14 NATURE STUDY. 
  power of continued attention. The child naturally gives 
his attention simply to the thing in which he is inter- 
ested, and only as long as he is interested. He is like 
a butterfly that flies from flower to flower, hardly alight- 
ing, always changing, never at rest. He must learn to 
hold his thought to one definite subject and to one 
definite purpose until he has obtained all the knowledge 
that he can obtain from his study. The nature lesson 
affords a better opportunity for this training than other 
observation lessons. His observation should also be 
thoughtful, —the wy should always follow the what. 
He sees that the cat has sharp, tearing teeth; why? 
He watches the cow chewing her cud; why does she 
masticate her food in this strange fashion? He sees 
the arrangement of the toes on the foot of the wood- 
pecker; why is not a woodpecker’s foot like an owl’s? 
He sees the curious arrangement of pollen in the lady’s- 
slipper; why is it so curiously placed? He sees the 
wonderful construction of the milkweed seed; why is it 
furnished with silky wings? He sees the twisting ten- 
dril of the grape-vine tightening and hardening about 
the trellis; why has the stem this power? All observa- 
tion should lead to questioning, — serious, thoughtful 
questioning, that must develop a reverent spirit. | 
From these nature lessons the child should gain 
knowledge, and this knowledge should be useful and 
definite. We may well ask here what knowledge is 
useful. The common tendency is toward materialism. 
That knowledge is considered most useful which shows 
immediate result in bread-winning. Reading, writing, 
and arithmetic have been considered indispensable to 
earning dollars and cents, and therefore essential; but 
the true teacher has broader views. She recognizes the
-P-A-G-E-15
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 15 
  
value of lessons which develop power in the child, 
and which enable him to enjoy life and to intelligently 
interpret his surroundings. The element of enjoyment 
should be emphasized all the more when the finger of 
destiny seems to point a child toward a life of dull and 
hard routine. Ifthe boy has to pick stones on the road 
or to handle hammer and drill in a quarry, all the more 
need of his learning to see the beautiful around him, 
and to read in nature such messages as will cheer and 
encourage him. in his toil. Knowledge which increases 
capacity for enjoyment, which opens new and right 
avenues through which the child may see and find pleas- 
ure, which ministers to his highest good, which helps 
his soul to grow, — this knowledge is useful knowledge. 
In another sense we must look for useful knowledge 
among the materials which will prepare the child for 
future study. Out of the broad field of knowledge 
which would be interesting and helpful to the child, we 
must select those subjects which will furnish foundation 
truths for the work which is to be done later in the 
_ school course. Before geography is studied as a science, 
all primary ideas involved in its study may be given the 
child in these observation or nature lessons. The 
foundation facts of botany may be observed in the pri- 
mary school. Birds, animals, fishes, frogs, bees, and 
butterflies — companions of the child in his home life, 
in his play, in his walks to school, in his vacations in 
the woods and fields—should be teaching him the 
underlying truths of zoology. The beginnings of min- 
eralogy and geology are in the pebbles with which he 
dams the stream, or the sand with which he plays upon 
the seashore. But best of all, the intelligent observa- 
tion of all these manifold objects gives him knowledge,
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 NATURE STUDY. 
through the getting of which he becomes able to get 
more and more. He grows in power to help himself, 
and so to help others. - 
This knowledge, in order to be useful, should be 
definite, a result of accurate observation and clear state- 
ment. No vague chatter about the pebble, the flower, 
or the insect will suffice. All teaching should lead the 
child to see and to know something which becomes 
definitely and clearly his own. 
One of the incidental, yet important, aims in nature 
study is expression. The nature study furnishes abun- 
dant opportunity for development of language power. 
These lessons are among the best lessons in thought 
getting. The child is constantly arriving at new thoughts 
which he desires to express to others. The eagerness 
of his desire insures interest in the lesson. The teacher 
should regard this lesson as a language lesson as well 
as a science lesson, although the language aim is not 
uppermost. But the child is constantly forming habits 
of expression. She should see that this expression is 
correct in detail, that it is complete, and that it is well- 
arranged. These results may be secured in part through 
the direction of the observation. Accurate observation 
must be expressed by accurate and correct statement. 
Orderly observation involves well arranged and system. 
atic expression. If the child sees the whole object and 
the parts in relation to the whole, he will be able to 
describe as he sees. The arrangement of paragraphs 
will naturally follow the grouping of ideas that come in 
orderly observation. 
Care should be taken in these lessons to keep the 
most important aim in the foreground. The lesson is to 
teach the child to see, to think, and to feel, and then to 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
    PURPOSE AND PLAN. 17 
  supply words to express what he sees and thinks and 
feels. /It is a mistake to give a lesson for the sake of 
teaching certain words. Teach the words only when 
they are needed to express the thoughts which demand 
utterance. Do not bring a flower to a child for the 
sake of teaching him the term calyx, but give him the 
term when he has learned that he needs it to describe to 
you the flower which he has found and in which he has 
become interested. The term vertebrate is not needed 
until the child has discovered that some animals are 
not possessed of a backbone. When it becomes neces- 
sary for him to group these animals which he has 
studied, he will recognize the necessity of the term, and 
it will be easily fixed in his mind. The words which 
he needs to use to express his thought become his own. 
Words which are impressed upon his memory by the 
teacher, without his recognition of this need, will be 
easily forgotten. They do not become a part of his 
experience. Teach the technical terms as they are 
needed for the expression of thought, but do not make 
them the chief end of the lessons. 
The child should gain through every nature lesson 
not only training in observation, new knowledge, and 
added power of expression, but also a greater power to 
see the beautiful, greater love of nature, and fuller ca- 
pacity for enjoyment. Observation, knowledge, expres- 
sion, enjoyment,—these should be in some measure 
the outcome of every nature lesson. 
The method to be followed in such teaching may be 
simply outlined in three words, — get, see, and say. If 
the child is to learn to observe, he must observe some- 
thing. It goes without saying that any lesson in ob- 
servation must be given in the presence of the object. 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 NATURE STUDY. 
  The lesson upon plants involves the presence of plants; 
stones are indispensable to a lesson on minerals, and 
an animal must likewise serve as illustration for the 
animal lessons. Get the specimen first of all. Let it 
be a specimen which the children, can easily obtain for 
themselves. Flowers grow everywhere. They are most 
valuable for study, because they will be seen again and 
again wherever the child may go. Hence it is doubly 
necessary that he should be able to interpret the message 
which they have to speak to him. They will line his 
life’s pathway; he must learn to see them aright. They 
can easily be brought into a schoolroom. The supply 
is unlimited; the children can procure them for them- 
selves, and can observe them at home as well as in 
school, because the material is so abundant and so 
easily obtained. Plant lessons naturally predominate in 
the nature study. 
Many animals can easily be brought into the school- 
room. Insects in glass bottles, birds in cages, fishes 
and snails in the aquarium or glass jar, beetles and frogs 
in pan or tub. Stones are always to be had for the 
asking. The miracle of the snow-crystal is repeated for 
us every winter, and so is the marvellous tracery of the 
frost upon the window-pane. “The stars come nightly 
to the sky,” the moon waxes and wanes, the sun rises 
and sets, winds blow, and rain falls. All the forces and 
facts of nature have their message for the children 
and for us, and easily lend themselves to our reverent 
questioning. 
Having the specimen, the next step is to see it. We 
have read of those who, having eyes, see not, and hav- 
ing ears, hear not. Of how many of us is this a faithful 
description? The teacher who would lead the child to
-P-A-G-E-19
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 19 
  
see must herself be open-eyed. She must see in the 
aster all that she would lead the child to see in it, and 
more. Unless she has learned to observe, she can nei-~ 
ther direct nor test the observation of her pupils. 
Remember, the child is to see and to gain knowledge 
through his own seeing, not to be told what the teacher 
sees. It is much easier for us to do the work than to 
help the child to do it; but their profit is in their doing. 
Learn to direct the attention of the children to the point 
to be observed, and to hold it there until the child has 
completed his observation. The attention of the child 
will be dependent upon his interest in the subject. Your 
manner of questioning and your own interest in the 
subject will do much to determine his interest and at- 
tention. Question skilfully, definitely; ask questions 
which will lead the child to think. Not: ‘“ What about 
the aster?” No one can answer definitely an indefinite 
question. Rather, direct the attention of the children 
to some definite point: “Look at the root of the aster. 
What is its color? Think; tell me how you see it. 
Look at the stem. Break it. What do you learn by 
breaking it? Look at this little yellow flower; look at 
this purple flower; are they alike or different? In what 
are they different? What is the shape of the yellow 
flower? What is the shape of the purple flower?” If 
a pupil becomes inattentive, give him a question to 
answer, or ask him to repeat an answer already given. 
Distribution of the questions will help to hold the atten- 
tion of the pupils, Orderly arrangement of the ques- 
tions will lead to orderly observation and complete 
description. 
Lead the children to verify statements that are made 
by others. John finds that his aster is purple. What
-P-A-G-E-20
20 NATURE STUDY. 
  
is the color of Jane’s, or Kate’s, or Joe’s? Mary says © 
that her stem is brittle. What does John find, and 
Kate, and Susie? Joe finds the ray-flower shaped like 
astrap. Does John, or Mary, or Kate? It is well for 
the children to hear the universal testimony before 
making their decision. So they come to know both _ 
sides of the shield. 
Observation which is clear and definite, and in which 
the children are interested, will stimulate to outside 
observation. No lesson is wholly good which does not 
lead to continued observation out of doors and at home. 
In order to encourage this habit, ask the children to tell 
what they have seen that is like the fact observed in the 
lesson. Give periods for the reports of out-of-door 
observation. Let the children keep note-books and 
compare notes. 
Through her emphasis of important facts the teacher 
can determine the knowledge which will remain with 
the child, —his interest, which is the chief factor in 
determining his memory. The children will naturally 
be attracted by many items which are not in themselves 
worth remembering. The curious streaks in the apple 
will mean as much to them as the number of seed-cells ; 
yet the latter fact is one which the. teacher will em- 
phasize in reviews. It is the one which gives the clue 
to the group to which the plant belongs. In the lesson 
on the aster, the structure of the two different kinds 
of flowers is the fact to be reiterated. Many other 
common flowers belong to the family thus described. 
The many flowers in one head, and the shape of the 
different flowers, are items which determine classifica- 
tion. The child need not know this now; but the 
teacher should know it, and in her reviews hold the
-P-A-G-E-21
    
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 21 
  attention of the children to those truths which they need 
to remember. 
All which is true in regard to correct expression in 
the language lessons applies to the expression element 
in nature study. Thought should come first, expres- 
sion afterward. The correct form should be taught by 
giving the child the right pattern, and then by affording 
abundant opportunity of practice. The systematic ar- 
rangement should come through the teacher’s plan, and 
the child’s habit of careful arrangement; ease and flu 
ency will result from frequent repetition of familiar facts. 
In the reproduction of the nature lessons, the teacher 
can give her attention to form and expression. In 
observation and thought getting the form should not be 
allowed to interfere. 
The following plan may suggest to teachers who have 
not yet attempted this work, the order of observation. 
This may be used until the teacher finds a better way 
for herself. 
I. Observation of the plant as a whole. (Place found, — 
kind of soil, sun or shade, — how found, general characteristics, 
and use.) 
II. Observation of parts. 
1. Root: color, kind, quality. 
2. Stem: position, shape, color, parts. (Break: woody, 
pithy.) Structure: joints, nodes. 
3- Leaves: parts, kind, veining, margin, shape, arrange- 
ment. 
4- Blossom: position, arrangement, parts, color, number 
and arrangement of parts. 
5. Fruit: kind, number, structure, time of ripening, use, 
distribution. 
6. Seed: studied as fruit.
-P-A-G-E-22
  
22 NATURE STUDY. 
The children will observe simple facts, and express 
them in appropriate language. “If the technical term is 
necessary to the expression, do not hesitate to give it. 
Do not say “saw-toothed,” when the child understands, 
or. may understand, that “serrate” expresses that 
meaning. 
After observing a leaf or flower, draw. The drawing 
leads to more definite observation. It is a mode of 
expressing what the child sees, and so affords the 
teacher a test of his observation. In this drawing, ap- 
prove observation of essential facts rather than fineness 
of detail. If the child shows that the base of the birch- 
leaf is broad and the apex pointed, the margin serrate, 
and leaf net-veined, his drawing is good, even if it seems 
crude and unfinished. Aim to make the drawing a 
simple report of the observation — not a picture. 
The comparison of different objects leads to more 
accurate observation. The grass-blade is seen to be 
narrow when placed beside a lilac-leaf. The rose-leaf 
is shown to be compound when compared with the 
simple geranium-leaf. The absence of stipules is shown 
only when a leaf is compared with another having 
stipules. After describing one animal, plant, or stone, 
compare it with another which is very different, that 
the contrast may give definiteness to the ideas gained. 
Compare it also with one which is like the first, in order 
to afford review of the ideas obtained through the first 
observation. j 
Other things being equal, select a familiar specimen 
for study, in order that the pupil may apply his knowl- 
edge in his every-day life. Make a careful sequence 
in selecting specimens. In the animal lessons, for in- 
stance, select types of the different branches of the
-P-A-G-E-23
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 23 
  animal kingdom. In studying birds, lead the children 
to observe the types of waders, scratchers, runners, and 
the like. With plants, choose such as to illustrate the 
leading classes, — plants with parallel-veined leaves, 
then plants with net-veined leaves ; flowers which are 
five-parted, flowers which are three-parted ; plants climb- 
ing by tendrils, others which are erect without support. 
So arrange this sequence that every new lesson shall have 
been prepared for by the lessons which have gone before, 
and that all together may give some harmonious whole. 
Let the reproduction of the observation lesson be 
oral first, and then written. The written work is more 
definite and more helpful when it has first been shaped 
in speech, 
Add to the observation some selection from literature 
which will show the thought of others in the direction 
in which the child has been studying. If he has been 
studying the fall flowers, let him learn to repeat Mrs. 
Jackson’s “ September” or “October.” If he has been 
observing the snow-flake, let him read “ Snow-bound,” 
or Emerson’s beautiful “Snow Hymn,” or Lowell’s 
“First Snow-fall.” If he has been describing his walk 
in the fields, read to him from Burrough’s “ Pepacton,” 
or Thoreau’s “Excursions.” Help him to memorize 
other selections which crystallize the poet’s thought. 
Through such reading and study he will begin to see as 
the poet sees, and feel as the poet feels. He will reap 
the benefit of the poet’s clear vision, and will learn not 
only to observe, but to interpret nature, — to ‘look 
through nature up to nature’s God.” 
In discussing nature study with teachers, the writer 
has found that the same difficulties are met in every
-P-A-G-E-24
24 NATURE STUDY. 
  schoolroom, and the same questions are everywhere 
asked. In order to help some of the teachers who may 
attempt this work for the first time, a few questions are 
here repeated and answered. 
“How long a time would you give to the description 
of one plant; and how many plants would you study 
in a term?” 
A common question. The answer cannot be given 
in exact numbers. The purpose in giving these lessons 
is not to multiply knowledge of facts, but to increase 
the child’s power of observation and his love of nature. 
~ Therefore the value of the lessons consists, not in the 
number of specimens observed, but in the manner in 
which the lessons are given. Continue the observation . 
of any one plant just so long as the pupils are inter- 
ested, and it provides opportunity for new. observation 
and new knowledge. If the work becomes monotonous, 
and so wearisome, to the children, bring in a new 
specimen. In observing the second plant or animal, 
the facts learned through the observation of the first 
will be reviewed, and new ones will be gained in the 
lines in which the new specimen differs from the old. 
The variety in the specimens occasions new interest, 
and the knowledge gained is repeated, reviewed, and 
increased through the observation of the new object. 
The teacher must be her own judge of the time when 
the child has learned all that he can learn from the 
specimen in hand. It is better for the child to leave an 
object with incomplete knowledge of it than to become 
indifferent through too long observation in the same 
line. But the teacher should be careful to keep the 
relation of the specimens in her mind, and to choose 
every day one which will afford opportunity for review-
-P-A-G-E-25
  
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 25 
ing the points already learned, and which will also 
interest the child in new lines. 
“When should the technical terms be introduced?” 
Just so soon as they are needed for definite and com- 
plete expression. The lesson should never be given for 
the sake of the term. Flowers should not be brought 
into the schoolroom for the purpose of teaching the 
child the term calyx, or corolla, stamen, or pistil. 
Rather, the child should come to the term when he 
finds it necessary in order to express his thought of 
the flowers. In all the lessons in science, as in lan- 
guage, the thought should determine and lead to the ex- 
pression. Do not hesitate to give the children the true 
terms when it appears that their language will be made 
clearer by the use of the true term. They will remem- 
ber the new word because it expresses the new idea, 
and it is naturally added to their vocabulary because of 
this very need of expression. The child, like his elders, 
prefers to call objects by their right names, and no term 
will present any difficulty to him after he has mastered 
the idea which it expresses. 
“How much written work would you require?” is 
another frequent question. 
At first, very little. There is a tendency to exagger- 
ate the value of the written record of the observation, 
so that the writing, rather than the seeing, becomes the 
end in view in the work. The object of the writing is 
to make a permanent and definite record of the obser- 
vation. The value of the writing lies in its affording 
both permanence and definiteness of expression. In 
the lower grades, ask the children to write in answer to 
questions, or from simple topics. Later they may write 
a description from their individual object, without the
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 NATURE STUDY. 
  
teacher’s help. This written description should be ac- 
curate, and orderly in arrangement, It should be illus- 
trated as far as possible; the diagram or picture of the 
object studied is a more faithful representation of the 
picture which he holds in his mind than is afforded by 
the words of his description. Encourage the pupils to 
draw everything that they see, boldly, simply, for the 
‘sake of showing the pictures which their minds hold. 
This drawing is invaluable, not only because it fixes the 
results of the observation, but also because it affords 
the teacher a picture of the child’s knowledge. In 
drawing, ask for accuracy and truth, and emphasize the 
important facts. Do not aim at picture-making, but 
at a truthful representation of form, size, and structure. 
“What plants can I use, or what animals or minerals? 
How shall I know what is best?” 
Three considerations must determine our choice of 
specimens. First, they should be familiar, rather than 
strange. If the child is observing a familiar plant or 
animal, he has already a fund of information which he 
can give to the teacher and to his mates. This giving 
begets confidence, and an interest in the subject, and 
places him in an attitude for receiving. Further, if the 
objects are familiar, and are frequently met in his daily 
walks, the child will have abundant opportunity to 
remember and apply the new knowledge which he has 
gained. He will become more thoughtful and observant 
as he moves in his beaten path. Second, the specimens 
should be those which can be easily obtained in abun- 
dance and kept in the schoolroom. Flowers furnish 
ample material; minerals can be found everywhere; 
animal life abounds in every village and city. The 
specimens which can be easily brought and kept in the
-P-A-G-E-27
  PURPOSE AND PLAN. 27 
  schoolroom are those which should be selected for the 
schoolroom study; and the results of the child’s ob- 
servation of these specimens should lead him to like 
observation out of doors, where he can meet the objects 
not easily brought into the schoolroom. And third, the 
specimens, besides being familiar and easily handled in 
the schoolroom, should be those whose study will afford 
useful knowledge. The field from which we may select 
is wide. We might easily travel in it a lifetime without 
seeming to exhaust its material in any degree. It is 
necessary to outline a clearly defined path, and to 
decide what subjects can most profitably be studied. 
If the science is to be pursued in the higher grades, 
such knowledge should be obtained through the child’s 
first observation as will lay the foundation for his future 
study, In the observation of animals, for instance, the 
types should be studied, so that he may become familiar 
with the individuals of the classes before he comes later 
to the study of the characteristics of the classes. The 
minerals which are most common in the rocks about 
him should be carefully observed, and the types of the 
great orders of plant life. No teacher can cover the 
entire field; but she can see that her selection affords 
opportunity for learning the essentials in each of the 
paths that she follows. 
It is well to keep a record of the specimens observed. 
In some of the happiest schoolrooms we have seen such 
a record upon the blackboard. Sometimes it appeared 
in the form of a border, in the units of which were 
drawn the objects observed. The procession would 
change from the milkweed, aster, and golden-rod, the 
apple and nut, to the snowflake and the icicle. Each 
showed some phase of the life of the season studied.
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 NATURE STUDY. 
  
The children should also keep their individual records. 
The pocket note-book is invaluable; in this the child 
should record his observations, not only of the speci- 
mens which he studies in the schoolroom, but also of 
those to which he is attracted outside. The observation 
of the schoolroom is worth little unless it results in the 
habit of seeing outside the schoolroom. Encourage the 
children to bring in items of interest which they have 
recorded. Compare notes, and lead them to see which 
facts are best worth knowing and remembering. If one 
day in the week is given to the reading and discussion 
of the matter recorded in these note-books, much will 
be done to encourage in the pupils a continued habit of 
observation. 
“Would you never tell the children anything? Must 
they find out everything for themselves?” 
Tell them when the time is ripe, — when the children 
are interested and eager to know, and when they have 
learned all that their eyes can tell them. Give them 
the further knowledge which they could only get through 
reading. These lessons ought to lead to larger and 
more intelligent reading, as well as to more careful ob- 
servation; and if the teacher judiciously adds the cov- 
eted plums of knowledge when the children have been 
reaching for them, and then points them to the sources 
whence they can obtain more knowledge, her telling 
will be as helpful as their seeing. 
“Would you use wild-flowers alone in the plant 
lessons?” 
No. In order to prepare the children for the obser- 
vation of the plant life in the spring, they should study 
house-plants in the winter, so that they may know how 
to look at their wild kindred. Have garden plants in
-P-A-G-E-29
PURPOSE AND PLAN. 29 
  
the schoolroom, and teach the children how to care for 
them. Plant seeds, and watch their development. Bring 
in buds and twigs in winter, and watch their develop- 
ment in the water and sunshine. Through this obser- 
vation the child will be prepared for the revelation of 
leaves and flowers that comes so abundantly in the 
outside world in the springtime. 
“ How can I prepare myself for these lessons?” 
This question is the most serious one that is asked. 
The greatest obstacle to the way to science teaching is 
Jack of preparation on the part of the teacher. But we 
cannot wait until every teacher has been trained through 
scientific study; we must make a beginning now. If 
the teacher has no knowledge of flower, or stone, or 
animal, let her choose a subject which seems most inter- 
esting to her, and learn through her own observation. 
Let her take some flower, and write all that she can see 
about it; then take some good book and verify what 
she has seen; then let her lead her children to see what 
she has seen. Her seeing will add interest to her teach- 
ing, and open avenues for her reading. Her desire to 
see and know will inspire that desire in the children; 
and simple and small as her first results may be, they 
may nevertheless be true and wholesome, and may lead 
to greater power and fuller knowledge. If she can 
study under the guidance of some one who has been 
well trained, so much the better; but if this help is 
wanting, she need not fear to make a beginning. The 
more clearly she sees, the better her children will ob- 
serve; the fuller her appreciation of nature, the greater 
the inspiration which she will give to her class; the 
more faithful and loyal her efforts, the more certain her 
success,  
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 NATURE STUDY. 
“What books shall I use?” 
This is a question which can, fortunately, be an- 
swered definitely. A list of books which may be found 
helpful is given in the final chapter. There is, how- 
ever, a certain class of books which are most desir- 
able for the teacher, although they do not offer help in 
methods of teaching. For uplift, for inspiration, she 
should go to the lovers of nature; she should read 
Burroughs, and Thoreau, and Mitford. She should 
study Wordsworth and Whittier, that she may learn 
to see nature through the poet’s eyes, and to love 
the subject that she teaches. The direct influence of 
this reading upon her thought and feeling will react 
upon her teaching, making it far more helpful than 
any study of outlines could be. If she finds, “sermons 
in stones, tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
and good in everything,” she will also find for herself 
a way to share her pleasures with her pupils.

OF CHILDREN. 
Description of the common house geranium. 
This plant grew in the window-box in our schoolroom. We 
have kept it in the sunshine, and have watered it every day. 
It has made our windows beautiful. We did not pull it up to 
look at its roots ; that would have killed it, But we have seen 
the roots of other geraniums. They were like hundreds of 
little brown threads. Ours must be like the others, 
The stems are round, stiff, and woody near the ground. 
The young stems seem covered with velvet. 
The leaves are sometimes alternate and sometimes opposite. 
They are kidney-shaped, with palmate veining and crenate 
margin, and are marked with a brown stripe near the edge. 
All the leaves are thick and velvety. The petioles are round, 
velvety, and from two to six inches long. At the base of the 
petioles are small green scales or bracts. These are fastened 
to the branch, and seem to wither and fall off; for some leaves 
have brown scales, and some have only scars to tell that the 
scales have been there. 
The flowers grow in clusters at the end of a long stem. I 
counted fifteen blossoms in one cluster. The flower stems are 
of the same length. There are five green, lance-shaped sepals 
in the calyx; and five red, rounded petals in the corolla.
-P-A-G-E-33
  LESSONS ON PLANTS. 33 
  
There are ten stamens with long, slender filaments grown 
together. The pistil becomes a long green tube as it ripens. 
I have not seen the seed. 
STUDY OF THE SWEET-PEA. 
Observe the seed in the spring. Soak seeds in water, 
and lead children to discover the seed-coat, the cotyle- 
dons, the radicle, the plumule. Plant them in clean 
sand or in a moist sponge, and watch their development. 
Question the children as to the changes that take place. 
Require them to keep little note-books in which they 
can draw the pea in the different stages, and record 
their observations. Lead them to observe and answer 
the following questions: What parts of the seed do you 
find? How does each change in soaking? What part 
grows first? In what direction? What next? What 
change takes place in the cotyledons? What becomes 
of the seed-coat? How are the young leaves folded? 
How are they arranged on the stem? 
For home observation, learn how peas are planted; 
how long before the leaves appear; how the stems are 
supported; how high the plant grows; when it first 
blossoms; how it is cared for. 
In September, study the entire plant. Where does it 
grow? For what purpose planted? What is the char- 
acter of the root? What does the root do for the plant? 
How can you show it? What is the character of the 
stem? Is it strong or weak? What is its position? 
Why does it not stand erect like the corn? How is it 
supported? How are the leaves arranged on the stem? 
Observe each leaf. How many parts to each leaf? 
(Teach compound leaf.) Where are the tendrils? How

do they support the plant? Observe leaflike parts at 
base of petiole. How are they placed? Draw them. 
(Teach stipules.) Where are the blossoms? How many 
on each stem? Do you find calyx? Corolla? Sta- 
mens? Pistil? Color of calyx? Number of sepals? 
Are they united or separate? Equal or unequal? What 
is the color of the corolla? Are the petals equal or 
unequal? Draw them. (Teach standard, the largest; 
wings, on each side; keel, the two inner petals.) Are 
they united,-or separate? 
How many stamens? Growing from what? How 
grouped? Where do you find the pistil? | What is its 
shape? Draw it. What does the pistil become in fruit? 
What part of the flower remains in the fruit? 
What are the parts of the pea-pod? How does it 
open? How many peas does it contain?. To what are 
they attached? Describe the ripe fruit. : 
Write a full description from the record made above.

STUDY OF THE APPLE. 
I. Observe apple-trees. Note height, position of 
trunk, color and other characteristics of bark, place and 
position of branches. Compare the apple and fir trees. 
Learn at home about grafting. Where are apples 
cultivated? 
II. Plant and study seed. 
III. In early spring place twigs in water and watch 
the development of the buds. What is the shape of the

twig? Are leaf-buds and blossom-buds separate? How 
can you tell? Do you find scars on the twig? Where? 
What do they tell? 
IV. Study a twig bearing blossoms. Which came 
first, leaves or blossoms? When? What was the size 
and condition of the leaves when the blossoms opened? 
Arrangement, shape, and parts of leaves? Do you find 
stipules? What becomes of them? Compare the up- 
per and under surface of the leaves. Draw, showing 
veining and margin. How are the blossoms arranged? 
Compare the stems in length. Shape of calyx. How 
many sepals? United or free? Shape? Where are 
the petals set? Howmany? Free or united? Shape? 
Color? To what are the stamens attached? How 
many? Do you find one or more pistils? How many? 
Look for unripe fruit. What part of the flower becomes 
fruit? What part falls off (deciduous)? 
V. Study the apple in season. First, as a whole: 
shape, size, color, use. Second, the parts: skin, flesh, 
seed-cells, and seeds. Cut it open and draw the sec- 
tions. Note that the skin is thin, smooth, glossy, closely 
adherent. The flesh juicy, composed of small cells. 
The seed-cells five, horny. The seeds brown, oval, 
pointed at the upper end, many. 
VI. Read and recite Bryant’s “ Planting of the Apple- 
Tree.” Read to the class Thoreau’s “Wild Apples.” 
Apples are well described in Holland’s “ Bitter Sweet.”

  STUDY OF THISTLES. 
(For Primary Grades.) 
Founp: In dry fields early in September. 
HeicutT: About three feet. A tough, stout, prickly weed, 
with large, fragrant, purple blossoms. 
Root: Stem-like, round, brown, tough, with small rootlets 
(tap-root). 
Stem: Stiff, upright, round, grooved, hollow, green. 
Leaves: Long, narrow, cut in sharp points, tipped with 
spines. (Why?) 
Bup: Cone-shaped, covered with green, pointed scales, tipped 
with spines. 
Biossoms: On the end of stalk, purple. One head with 
very many little blossoms having long, slender, white 
tubes. 
Seep: After the blossom fades, each seed flies away, helped 
by the thistle-down, —light, silky hairs fastened to end 
of the seed. 
READING-LESSON TO ACCOMPANY DESCRIPTION. 
Little Thistle grew in the brown field all alone by herself. 
She thought she was all alone, for no other thistle was near her ; 
but Sweet-fern grew near with his fragrant leaves, the golden 
Aster smiled in the sunlight, and everywhere the soft gray moss 
made a carpet where the flowers might play. 
“T wish I might fly away like that swallow,” said little 
Thistle. “I must stay here alone in this brown field, because 
this tough root holds me so firmly in the ground. Nobody 
loves me, with these sharp ugly leaves that would drive any- 
body away. What can I do?” The swallow flew near, and 
heard her sigh. “Just grow your very best where you are, 
little Thistle, and some day you may have your wish,” he said.
-P-A-G-E-37
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 37 
  
So little Thistle stopped sighing, and tried to be as sweet as 
she could be. She lifted her purple head into the sunshine, 
and became so fragrant that the bees came in little companies 
to share her sweetness. “We love you, Thistle,” they said. 
When the hot days came, and the other flowers nearly fainted, 
Thistle’s long root found water to drink low in the ground, so 
she was still brave and bright. 
She became afraid one day when a cow came across the 
field where she grew, eating flowers and leaves and grasses as 
she passed. ‘How sweet that thistle is,” said the cow ; “ but 
I must not touch those thorny leaves;” so the thistle was 
saved. 
One day I looked across the fields and saw little, white- 
winged seeds flying through the air. I thought they were fairy 
birds, for their wings were soft and shiny ; but when they came 
near I saw that Thistle was having her wish, — she was flying 
away. 
LESSON ON CORN. 
Grows where? What kind of soil does it need? 
How is the soil prepared? When planted? How is 
the seed prepared? How planted? (Plant corn and 
watch growth. Soak seeds. Lay over cotton on glass 
of water.) 
Study seed : Observe seed-covering, albumen, caulicle, 
plumule, cotyledon. 
Study plant: General appearance, height, grace. 
Roots: Many, tough, like cords, spreading from 
bottom of stem, short. 
Stem: Tall, erect, jointed, smooth, flattened on side 
next the ear. Within, white pith, in which we find many 
white, woody (longitudinal) fibres. 
Leaves: Growing from joints, wrapped about the
-P-A-G-E-38
38 NATURE STUDY. 
  
stem from one joint to another, then spreading, long, 
narrow, sharp, pointed, with parallel veins and entire 
edge. 
Blossom: The plant has two kinds of blossoms. At 
the end of the plant stem is a spreading tassel made of 
many small blossoms. In these blossoms we find the 
anthers. The dust or pollen falls when we shake the 
tassel. 
Growing from the joints of the stem are the ears of 
corn. We know there must have been flowers with 
pistils where the seeds are found. The blossoms were 
once hidden away in the wrappings that now cover 
the seed. 
Describe the fruit: What is the silk? Its use? Why 
are some ears of corn red and white? Commit to 
memory Whittier’s “Corn Song.” Read the story of 
Mondamin in “ Hiawatha.” Why is corn called Indian 
corn? Draw the seed in different stages of germina- 
tion. Draw a section of the stem. Draw a leaf. What 
plant do you know that is like the corn plant? Com- 
pare the corn plant and the pumpkin vine. 
LESSON ON THE DANDELION. 
The dandelion grows everywhere, — in the fields, on 
the lawn, and by the roadside. This dandelion blos- 
somed in early April. I have seen many in November. 
The root is a long, thick tap-root, with a milky juice. 
The leaves seem to grow from the root, and lie flat 
on the ground like a rosette. They have ragged 
edges. The sharp points gave the flower its name, — 
Lion’s tooth. 
The flower stem is hollow, with a bitter, milky juice.
-P-A-G-E-39
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 39 
  
Children make dandelion curls from the stem. The 
yellow blossom is set in a green cup or involucre. 
This involucre is made of a double row of narrow 
green scales. The many bright yellow flowers grow 
from a flat disk. When the flower goes to seed it 
forms a feathery ball. Every seed has a tiny tuft of 
silky hairs, with which it rides away upon the wind. 
What use is made of dandelions? How many years 
do they live? How are they sown? Are all dandelions 
alike? Compare leaves of different dandelions. Draw 
the disk, the leaf. Can you find stamens in the little 
blossoms? Pistils? Memorize part of Lowell’s poem, 
“To a Dandelion.” 
DESCRIPTION OF AN ASTER. 
(By Primary Children.) 
We find the aster growing by the roadside and in the woods 
and fields. It has many purple or white starlike blossoms. 
The word “aster” means s¢av. The root is brown and fibrous. 
The stem is round, stiff, woody, and easily broken. The leaves 
are alternate, net-veined, sessile, narrow, pointed. The flowers 
are many and in large sprays. Every blossom is really a family 
of tiny flowers, called a head. ‘The asters have two kinds of 
flowers in each head, —ray flowers, and disk flowers. The 
ray flowers are on the outside, and are purple. The disk 
flowers are on the inside, and are yellow. The ray flowers are 
strap-shaped ; the disk flowers are tube-shaped. The cup of 
green scales which holds the blossom is the involucre. 
The children who observed the aster and wrote this 
description, committed to memory these lines of Helen 
Jackson’s : — 
“ The lands are lit 
With all the autumn blaze of golden-rod, 
And everywhere the purple asters nod, 
And bend, and wave, and flit ;”
-P-A-G-E-40
40 NATURE STUDY. 
  and also the couplet, — 
“ Asters by the brook-side 
Make asters in the brook.” 
They learned to recite “October’s bright blue weather,” 
and Longfellow’s — 
“ Spake full well, in language quaint and olden, 
One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine, 
When he called the flowers so blue and golden, 
Stars which in earth’s firmament do shine.” 
OCTOBER LESSONS. 
(For Young Teachers.) 
Our thoughts are with the young teachers who are 
making so many new beginnings; and our purpose in 
grouping these few lessons is to help them to undertake 
work which to many seems vague, because difficult, and 
yet to which they may bring much native wit, in spite 
of their trepidation and seeming lack of preparation. 
The lessons, for want of a better name, may be termed 
observation lessons. Their object should be to interest 
the children in their every-day surroundings, to lead 
them to observe more thoroughly, and through the 
study of the fruits, to associate with the harvest the 
truth which the ingathering typifies. The lessons will 
be very simple, and far from exhaustive. They may 
serve as a beginning, to stimulate both teacher and 
pupil to more scientific work later. At least, they will 
make the children and their growing leader more con- 
scious of the beauty about them, and help in some 
measure to open their eyes and ears to the message 
which wayside flower and forest leaf may bring, or the 
truth which is wrapped in the unnoticed seed or the

  accustomed harvest. The lessons being prepared for 
October, the material should be what that month affords. 
The few remaining fall flowers may serve for the first 
week; the changing leaves will supply material for the 
second ; the common fruits and vegetables for the third ; 
while the fourth may be given to the study of memory 
gems and the harvest lessons. 
Among the flowers, we shall find the golden-rod, 
aster, gentian, sunflower, and late clover. Begin with 
the golden-rod, which so many school-children would 
choose for the national flower. Bring an entire plant to 
your class Monday morning, and try to secure as 
perfect a specimen as possible. 
Ask your pupils to tell you where they have found 
the golden-rod. After several have told their expe- 
riences, the class will be ready to tell you that it grows 
“ everywhere,” as far as they know. It blossoms when? 
Some will remember having seen the blossom in July; 
and now it is October, and the fields are still bright 
with the sturdy flowers. Notice the long, stiff, brittle 
stem, the arrangement of the narrow leaves, which they 
may represent by a drawing. Call attention to the 
shape of the plumed blossoms, which leads us to speak 
of a “spray of golden-rod.” Then lead the children to 
see that each spray is made up of numberless little 
yellow heads set in green cups. By and by they may 
be told the names of these parts, and discover for them- 
selves the tiny flowers of which the heads are composed. 
But these lessons do not purpose to teach the technical 
terms. The children will want them later; and when 
they need them, they can be easily fixed in the 
memory. 
Attention has been called to the height of stem, the
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 NATURE STUDY. 
  
shape of the leaf and spray, and the general structure 
of the blossom. Ask the boys and girls to look for 
other specimens of golden-rod, and see if all are alike. 
They will find a short-stemmed, narrow-plumed golden- 
rod in the school-yard, perhaps. In the swamp, near 
the old stone wall which borders it, is a tall, graceful 
specimen, with slender, spreading plumes. Some will 
find the sweet golden-rod; others, the showy, club- 
shaped blossoms; and others still, the brilliant speci- 
mens that grow near the sea. Some will be in seed 
already; these will deserve close attention. Collect 
specimens of the different varieties, not to lie around in 
heaps on the desks, but to be arranged neatly in sepa- 
rate jars. They will doubtless stir you to seeking their 
names and learning more of their kindred. If the chil- 
dren have observed closely enough to tell in writing the 
marks which characterize the golden-rod, so that they 
are able to recognize it, and have come to recognize 
the variety in the groups that grow near their homes, 
we may be sure that they have gained in interest, and 
that their eyes are brighter than before the lesson. 
The next lesson may introduce the asters, purple and 
white. The meaning of the name creates interest among 
the pupils. These star-flowers grow—where? They 
are not so well known as the golden-rod, and will need 
closer observation. But already the class observe with 
greater enthusiasm. Let them compare the white and 
purple asters, then the asters and golden-rod. Tell 
them, if you choose, that each purple ray is a flower in 
itself, and bid them look for the tiny yellow flowers in 
the disk. Then set them hunting for different asters 
in woods and fields. Read to the class Bryant’s “ Death
-P-A-G-E-43
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 43 
—_——— 
of the Flowers,” and lead them to see that he too cared 
to watch — 
“ Upon the hill the golden-rod, 
The aster in the wood, 
The yellow sunflower by the brook.” 
The following lesson may have the sunflower for its 
subject. Bring a specimen in which the seeds have 
ripened, as well as a fresher one. If possible, have the 
entire plant. The large, rough, long-stemmed leaves 
may be described and drawn. The tough woody stalk 
should be observed. The large, overlapping scales of 
the cup, the yellow ray-flowers, the smaller disk flowers, 
have probably been unnoticed before, though the sun- 
flower is an old neighbor. See how the seeds are 
packed in their little sockets. What must have been 
in the disk before the seeds came? What differences 
between the sunflower and the aster? Are they alike 
in anything? 
For the next day, can you not find the gentian, that 
beloved autumn blossom, that comes 
“— alone 
When woods are bare and birds have flown, 
And frosts and shortening days portend 
The aged year is near his end”? 
Perhaps you will find the closed gentian, with its clus- 
ters of vivid blossoms. Perhaps the delicate fringed 
gentian will reward your search. Notice the bright 
color, the delicate fringes, the thick clusters of the 
closed blossoms, or the slender-stemmed cups of the 
daintier flower. See how the leaves are set. Think of 
all the fall flowers you know. Are any others like this? 
Read parts of Bryant’s “Fringed Gentian” to the class. 
Another lesson may be given to the late clover, white

  or red. Draw the beautiful form of the leaf, and speak 
of the trefoil (three-leaf), its other name. Separate the 
head into the individual flowers, and see how many and 
how similar. Let the pupils observe these without 
question, and see what they have to tell. What new 
thing does the leaf tell? Look at the stems where they 
join the stalk. Is any larger flower like the tiny clover- 
flower? 
_ In the afternoon of some Friday let each pupil choose 
and bring a flower which has been studied, and write all 
that he can see in it. Judge then whether the lessons 
have been fruitful. Think about the leaves, which shall 
furnish materials for the next week’s lessons. 
There is ample material for many lessons in Octo- 
ber’s leaves, with their gold and crimson, their olives 
and browns. Beauty of color is added to beauty of 
form, and the children will delight in both. We will 
not forget the simple purpose of our lessons, —to win 
the children to greater enjoyment in the beauty about 
them, and to make them desirous of new knowledge 
of their every-day surroundings. So these lessons will 
not attempt to lead to classification or technical terms, 
but will aim to inspire an interest which will prepare 
the way for a more careful study by and by. 
Monday’s lesson should have been made ready in 
good season. No teacher can afford to take up any 
lesson without careful preparation. For the experi- 
enced teacher the details need not be so carefully 
planned; her experience has been in itself a prepara- 
tion. But that will not render illustration unnecessary, 
and illustration involves preparation. Do not hope to 
awaken interest and lead the pupils to good work 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 45 
  
unless you are willing to do faithful, earnest work in 
preparing your own lessons. 
The talks about the October flowers have opened 
the eyes of teacher as well as children. The trees 
have new messages for her. She comes to Monday’s 
lesson with her hands filled with leaves, and a ready 
enthusiasm speaking in eye and voice. The children 
have remembered Friday’s request, it is to be hoped, 
and have their hands full, too. The specimens which 
they find for themselves will have a double interest. 
Here are oak, maple, and ash, birch, poplar, and beech, 
pine, cedar, and hemlock. The elm and the locust are 
represented, the horse-chestnut and the linden, the 
hickory and the chestnut. 
Begin with what the children know, —a rule that 
may be safely applied in all your teaching. Let them 
mame for you the different leaves which they have 
brought. Place the familiar ones by themselves, those 
which are unfamiliar being laid in another group. If 
you find, as you doubtless will, that some of the pupils 
know much more than the rest, lead them to tell how 
they distinguish one leaf from another. In their 
endeavor to lead their neighbors to see the charac- 
teristics of the leaves, they will observe more closely 
themselves, and see more clearly because they must 
state definitely. 
“The elm leaf has one point, and the maple has 
five,” they say. ‘The veins on the maple leaf seem 
to start from the end of the stem, and in the elm leaf 
there is one large vein in the middle, with smaller ones 
branching from it.” Now we come to the need of words 
which we have not used before. “The point” of the 
elm leaf is the apex; the large vein is the mid-vein;
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 NATURE STUDY. 
  
such veining is called “feather veining.” Find the 
apex of the birch leaf, of the chestnut, of the oak. 
The edges of the maple and oak leaves are cut in, to 
make several large “ points.” These are lobes. How 
many lobes has your maple leaf? Your oak leaf? 
Have you any other lobed leaf? 
The time of the lesson has been used, and the chil- 
dren have learned this, —that there are many leaves 
which they do not know, growing near home, and that 
they need to know the right names in order to describe 
them to one another. Some of these terms they have 
learned in this lesson. 
If the lesson has caused both teacher and children 
to realize that there is a new story for them to read in 
the leaves, and that they must find the words which fit 
the story, there will be no lack of interest in Tuesday’s 
study. It is very probable that the teacher herself 
needs to study carefully the leaves which she brings to 
this exercise. There is a little book prepared by Miss 
Youmans, and called “The First Book of Botany,” which 
will answer questions about shapes and names. It is 
a help in studying the leaf forms. 
Bring to the class for Tuesday the maple and elm 
leaf, and have the children draw both. As they draw, 
teach them to name petiole, blade, apex, base, veins, 
and margin. Then compare the two. Which has the 
longer petiole? Which is lobed? Which is feather- 
veined? How do the margins differ? Which has a 
notched margin? That is called saw-toothed, or serrate. 
Which has a plain margin, without teeth? That is called 
entire. How many lobes has the maple? See if you 
can draw it without looking at the leaf. Notice the 
base of the elm leaf. Look closely at the leaf, so that 
you can draw it from memory.
-P-A-G-E-47
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 47 
  
Wednesday take the oak and birch. The pupils 
will work more rapidly, because the comparison in- 
volves review of Tuesday’s lesson. Thursday, the 
horse-chestnut and the poplar. What other compound 
leaves do you know? What curious fact do you ob- 
serve as you study the petiole of the poplar leaf? 
Friday study the corn, the grass, and the pumpkin 
leaf. Place the broad leaf beside the narrow one, and 
the children will exclaim at the marked difference. 
What new veining do we find? Find and name the 
parts of the pumpkin leaf. What strange characteristic 
of the stem? Of the surface of the blade? 
In the afternoon of Friday review the week’s work. 
Let every pupil draw and describe some leaf, observing 
its parts in turn, and telling how it can be distinguished 
from other leaves. Encourage the children to make 
collections of pressed leaves, and to count the number 
of kinds which they can find. And bid them watch 
the glowing October colors, and learn the dress worn 
by the ripening leaves. What trees are gold, what red, 
what brown? From what trees are the leaves soonest 
stripped? What leaves cling after they are withered? 
What can you find upon the twigs from which the 
leaves have fallen? What story has the witch-hazel 
to tell? The birch? The alder? What trees have 
their fruits? — but that belongs to next week’s lesson. 
Does not the first lesson lead to many more? The 
children will share your interest, and the October 
lessons will foretell April lessons of a larger growth. 
October’s fruits are so many and so varied that the 
“general lessons” of the entire month might well be 
given to them. Remembering our purpose,—to de-
-P-A-G-E-48
OG ge

velop in the minds of the children a wider interest in 
nature, and to lead them to feel that she has many 
lessons for them to learn,— we will suggest work that 
will induce these results, rather than those that would 
tend to closer observation and more definite knowledge 
of individual objects. From the following, select for 
the third week’s exercises those for which you can best 
obtain specimens and illustrations. Begin always with 
that which is already familiar to the children, and em- 
phasize the new thoughts as they are developed. In 
every lesson recapitulate for the sake of impressing the 
essential points made in the exercise, and leaving the 
non-essentials in the background. Do not spend time 
in having the pupils relate that some apples are green, 
some are red, and some are yellow. The character of 
the seed-cells, their number, and the juicy pulp which 
surrounds them, deserve more attention. These are 
essential points of difference between the apple and 
other fruits, — as the pumpkin, for example. 
I. Name ten fruits cultivated at home. 
Name ten fruits which can be obtained in the markets. 
Name ten fruits which are used for food. Ten which 
are not used for food. 
What is the fruit of the oak? The chestnut? The 
ash? The box-elder? 
What is the fruit of the beet? The turnip? The 
cabbage? The potato? The tomato? The corn? 
What is fruit? 
Where are the seeds of the pumpkin? In what are 
they enclosed? Name other fruits like the pumpkin. 
In what are the seeds of the apple enclosed? Name 
other fruits like the apple. 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  LESSONS ON PLANTS. 49 
  
What fruit most resembles the peach? How does 
the peach differ from the apple. 
What is the fruit of the hickory tree? How does it 
differ from the apple? 
Name all the juicy or fleshy fruits you remember. 
Name all the dry fruits. 
II. Bring to the class green and ripe tomatoes, 
Observe the fruit as a whole, and the structure and 
arrangement of parts. 
Where does it grow? Characteristics of the plant. 
When does it ripen? 
Use, — how prepared for use? 
Parts, — skin, pulp, seeds. 
Skin, — color, thick or thin, rough or smooth. 
Pulp,—juicy or dry? Howcomposed? How shaped? 
Seeds, — how many? How attached? Howshaped? 
Draw as a whole and in sections. 
Observe the part of the stem to which the fruit is 
attached. What do you find? Do you know any 
other fruit like the tomato? 
III. Study the cucumber, squash, or pumpkin, as 
you have studied the tomato, and compare the three. 
Write the differences between them; the resemblances. 
How do they differ from the tomato? 
IV. Collect specimens of dry fruits found on the way 
to school. 
What specimens have you found that you cannot 
name, among all which have been collected? 
What fruits open to allow the seeds to fall out? Do 
they open in the same or different ways? What kinds 
of opening do you find? 
Study the bean and pea in the pod. Compare with 
the morning-glory, the poppy, or the nasturtium.

—— 
Find the touch-me-not, and show the children how 
the fruit opens. 
What fruits do you find without any provision for 
opening? 
V. How are seeds planted? When? 
Let some boy describe the proper method of plant- 
ing corn, beans, tomatoes. Howis wheat sown? Rye? 
Oats? 
How are the seeds of wild flowers planted? The 
dandelion? The thistle? The aster? 
Who helps to plant the acorn and chestnuts? The 
cherries and berries? How are the seeds of the touch- 
me-not scattered? The witch-hazel? 
Show how the beggar-ticks which stick to our cloth- 
ing are carried; the “stick-me-tights;” the burdocks. 
What other seeds are planted in the same way? 
How are the seeds of the ash and maple carried? 
The seeds of the pine? Of the cottonwood? 
In what ways have you seen seeds distributed ? 
Name seeds that are distributed by the wind; by 
birds; by squirrels; by means of the wool or hair of 
animals. 
Select some seed to draw and describe. 
The study of the fruit leads naturally to the thought 
of the harvest, the ingathering of the fruits, and the 
truths of which they are the type. Let the last week 
of the October lessons be given to these. From among 
the many familiar harvest hymns select one which the 
children can best understand, and teach it carefully. 
Lead them to consider the thought in the song, that 
they may sing with the heart as well as the voice. To 
that end it will be necessary to study the verses thought-
-P-A-G-E-51
LESSONS ON PLANTS. SI 
———_—_——_—$ 
fully before they are committed to memory. Some of 
us remember singing the joyous refrain, — 
“ Come cheerful companions, unite in our song;” 
and adding, — 
“Sing for the deacons whenever you sing,” — 
the childish and innocent paraphrase of — 
“Sympathy deepens whenever you sing.” 
Evidently the thought in the song had been a minor 
consideration with the instructors of our youth. How- 
ever we may smile at our childish misinterpretation, we 
should try to prevent our pupils from making the same 
mistakes. The reverent spirit which will come through 
thoughtful study of their meaning should pervade the 
singing of the harvest hymns. 
Beyond the learning of the hymn, take time to study 
some poem which is appropriate to the season, and 
encourage the children to bring to you selections which 
they have read and liked. Here is one from Whittier, 
modified by its separation from the poem to which it 
belongs : — 
“This is the pleasant harvest time, 
When cellar bins are closely stowed, 
And garrets bend beneath their load, 
And the old swallow-haunted barns, 
Brown-gabled, long, and full of seams, 
Through which the moted sunlight streams, 
Are filled with summer’s ripened stores, 
Its odorous grass and barley sheaves, 
From the low scaffolds to the eaves.” 
Question the children until the picture is real to 
them, and they are sharers in the joy it speaks. With
-P-A-G-E-52
52 NATURE STUDY. 
  
what are the cellar bins stored? Beneath what load 
do the garrets bend? Who has seen a swallow-haunted 
barn? Who can tell more of them? What is the 
“moted sunlight”? Can you shut your eyes and see 
its beams lighting up the dusty old hay-loft? What 
are “summer's ripened stores”? Who knows the 
“odorous grass”? What do the full barns and over- 
flowing bins tell us? Think of the people who are 
everywhere rejoicing in the year’s harvest. Why? 
What came before the harvest? Speak of the care of 
the ground, the sowing of the seed, the toil that was 
necessary before the harvest could be gathered in. 
And you will not forget “the early and the latter 
rain,” or the summer sunshine, without which the 
harvest would have failed. Do not preach; that will 
avail little. But if your spirit is earnest and sincere, 
the veriest child in your room will unconsciously come 
to lift a grateful heart to the Lord of the harvest, and to 
recognize in some measure the beautiful truth that we 
are workers together with Him. 
If your pupils learn readily, and your heart is in your 
work, there will be time to memorize other “gems” 
before the week is past. Parts of Whittier’s “Corn 
Song” may be committed to memory, after they have 
been studied. How joyous it is, and full of “the us- 
sung beauty hid in life’s common things below.” 
There is joy and gladness, song and sunshine, in 
Helen Hunt Jackson’s “ October’s Bright Blue Weather.” 
‘Tis a beautiful thing to associate with the familiar 
sights and sounds which have been dullest prose to 
country boys and girls. You have done much for 
them if you have been able to link with their every-day 
commonplace, this thought of beauty: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 53 
  
“O suns and skies and clouds of June, 
And flowers of June together, 
Ye cannot rival for one hour 
October’s bright blue weather. 
“ When loud the bumble-bee makes haste, 
Belated, thriftless, vagrant, 
And golden-rod is dying fast, 
And lanes with grapes are fragrant; 
“When gentians roll their fringes tight 
To save them for the morning, 
And chestnuts fall from satin burs 
Without a sound of warning ; 
“When on the ground red apples lie 
In piles like jewels shining, 
And redder still on old stone-walls 
Are leaves of woodbine twining ; 
“When all the lovely wayside things 
Their white-winged seeds are sowing, 
And in the fields, still green and fair, 
Late aftermaths are growing ; 
“When springs run low, and on the brooks, 
In idle golden freighting, 
Bright leaves sink noiseless in the hush 
Of woods for winter waiting. 
“O suns and skies and flowers of June, 
Count all your boasts together, 
Love loveth best of all the year 
October’s bright blue weather.” 
If you have loved your lessons on leaf and flower 
and fruit, the children will love this poem, and rejoice 
in the beautiful familiar pictures it paints for them. 
Its words are sweet and simple, and few of them are 
strange. You will not need to analyze it line by line, 
though you may have to explain the ‘ aftermath,” and
-P-A-G-E-54
  54 NATURE STUDY. 
“golden freighting.” But if you heartily enjoy its 
music and beauty, the children will share your enjoy: 
ment. Their lessons should have helped to prepare 
them for this. 
If it pleases you to gather the lessons into a Friday 
afternoon exercise, you may make a pleasant, helpful 
hour which the children will always remember. The 
written descriptions of leaf, flower, and fruit may be 
read, the poems recited, and the harvest hymns sung. 
If the room is decorated with leaves and fruits, and 
the boards are filled with appropriate selections, it 
may be a miniature Harvest Festival, and a fitting 
close for the October Lessons.

A SPRING LESSON. 
(Reported in the hope that it may be suggestive to those teachers who are ques- 
tioning how to teach.) 
The children had been watching eagerly for the first 
signs of spring. The long Northern winter had out- 
lasted their interest in snowballs and snow forts. Long 
before the winds had lost their keenness or the ice had 
disappeared from the pavements, the boys had collected 
on the bare spots in the sidewalk to play marbles, and 
the girls had produced their hoops and jump-ropes, to 
help the spring along. Inspired by the faith and hope 
ef the children, the robins came back, by two and in 
zompanies, to sing their spring messages. The blue- 
birds were not to be outdone. They hurried so fast  
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 NATURE STUDY. 
  after the robins that it was hard to tell which came first. 
Then the poplars shook out their gray tassels, the 
maples reddened in the sunshine, the winds repented 
of their iciness, and at last, one day in early April, 
Willie Lando came breathless into the schoolroom, 
bearing, close held in his grimy little hands, a pasque- 
flower. 
“T found it out here on the prairie, beyond the mo. 
tor track,” he volunteered, pleased at the commotion 
excited by the advent of the welcome blossom. “ By 
and by there will be heaps of ’em,— ground covered 
thick as spatters; but now they look just like little gray 
balls of fur. This was the only flower I could find.” 
The other children gathered around, to ask questions 
and to express their astonishment and delight. But their 
investigations were interrupted by the school bell which 
summoned them to their seats. The interruption was a 
brief one, however ; for the teacher was wise, and knew 
the value of a word inseason. Although the programme 
for the day gave the first period to arithmetic, Miss 
Hayes changed her plan, that she might teach the chil- . 
dren the lesson that the pasque-flower came to bring. 
The enthusiasm already aroused might thus be strength- 
ened and turned into channels where it would prove of 
most avail. So, after the morning hymn had been 
sung, and the child voices had joined in repeating the 
words of greeting, Miss Hayes introduced the new- 
comer to the children. 
“Willie has brought us something to enjoy this morn- 
ing,” she said; “how many would like to thank him?” 
The little hands were lifted to speak the thanks, which 
were not belied by the eager faces. Willie sat up 
proudly in his seat, and mentally resolved to come to
-P-A-G-E-57
  
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 57 
  
school that afternoon, instead of going fishing, as he 
had planned. The questions were continued. 
“ What is the flower which I hold in my hand?” 
Minnie called it a mayflower; James ventured to 
announce that the boys called those blossoms goslings ; 
and Maud named it crocus. Miss Hayes heard them 
all, then talked with the children of the Easter just 
passed, and they repeated together their Easter hymn. 
Then she told them that the little blossom is called the 
Easter flower, or pasque-flower, because it blossoms at 
Easter, and comes to tell the children of the new life 
that will show itself soon in the budded trees and the 
brown-carpeted woods. They were glad to use the new 
name. 
“Look closely at the flower and be ready to tell me 
something about it,” Miss Hayes says, holding the blos- 
som where all can see it. 
The eager eyes were fixed on the flower, and the 
hands and faces soon indicated that some discovery had 
been made. “The flower is purple.” “There is some- 
thing like gray fur under the purple part.” “TI can see 
something yellow inside the flower.” ‘The stem is 
covered with hair.” 
“Let us all look at the stem and think about it,” Miss 
Hayes suggested. With her pencil to direct their eyes, 
and her questions to lead their thoughts, the little ones 
succeeded in finding, and saying, that “The stem is 
short, round, green, hollow, and is covered with silky 
hairs.” The children who could remember all that they 
had seen, and could tell it in one sentence, were allowed 
to hold the flower and describe the stem to the class. 
They were eager to share the privilege. The eyes were 
summoned to watch while the description was given, to 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
58 NATURE STUDY. 
  see if it was wholly true. ‘ Because we want to see the 
truth about the pasque-flower, and to tell the truth 
about it,” Miss Hayes said gently. 
The time was short, it seems. The eyes and lips had 
been busy, and yet they had been busied only with the 
stem of the little flower. “Shall we talk about it again 
to-morrow?” Miss Hayes asked. The glad “Yes!” 
betokened so much interest that she rejoiced in her 
change of programme. 
Willie Lando retired with great dignity and sense of 
responsibility, to put fresh water in the vase that held 
the blossom. The next morning there was another 
lesson; and so on the next, and the next. Meanwhile 
the children had searched the fields far and wide, and 
had been rewarded by finding the blossoms in generous 
numbers for themselves. Before the lessons were done 
they all had flowers of their own, which they held gently 
and lovingly as they described them to Miss Hayes. 
The descriptions varied in completeness and in arrange- 
ment. The following is Willie’s : — 
“T found this little blossom out on the prairie, near 
the motor track, the roth day of April. It is called the 
pasque-flower, because it blossoms at Easter time. It 
is the first flower we see in the spring. The pasque- 
flower has a short, round stem, which is hollow, and 
covered with long, silky hairs. There is one purple 
flower on the end of the stem. The flower-cup is made 
of six broad, purple leaves, which are silky on the out- 
side. There are several rows of stamens inside the 
flower. They are like little threads, and have a yellow 
anther at the end to hold the pollen. The stamens are 
around the pistils. The pistils are white now, but by 
and by they will be like long brown feathers, which will

fly away in the wind when the seed is ripe. That is 
the way the pasque-flower is planted. Underneath the 
blossom there is a cup of narrow, silky leaves; these 
are folded around the bud to keep it warm. The leaves 
of the pasque-flower grow after the blossom has come.” 
On the blackboard next day we found a reading les- 
son for the children, which Miss Hayes had placed 
there: — 
OUR PASQUE-FLOWER. 
The winter snows were hardly gone, 
When in her robes of fur 
The pasque-flower came to cheer our hearts, 
We ran to welcome her. 
We knew her in her soft gray cloak, 
Her purple silken gown, 
And in the sunshine, too, we saw 
Her dainty golden crowr. 
“Oh, tell us, little flower,” we cried, 
“ How dared you come so soon? 
The winds are cold. The other flowers 
Will scarce be here till June.” 
“TI came because the boys and girls 
Were waiting for the spring. 
I knew it would seem nearer if 
I helped by blossoming. 
“I wrapped me in my warm fur coat, 
I donned my purple gown, 
And borrowed sunshine from the skies 
To wear upon my crown. 
“J gathered courage then, and pushed 
The soft brown earth aside; 
For, since the warm spring sun had come, 
What need to longer hide?

3 DESCRIPTIONS OF PLANTS BY CHILDREN IN 
PRIMARY GRADES. 
  
GERANIUM. 
The parts of the geranium are roots, stem, leaves, and buds. 
The roots look like little threads. 
Some roots are white, and some are brown. 
The roots grow down in the ground, and the stem upward 
like we would raise our arms. 
‘The stem feels hard and rough. 
In some places it is shiny, and some it is not. The leaf has 
a blade. The stem has little bracts. 
The geranium leaf is shaped like a shield. 
The veins in the leaf are shaped like a hand. 
It is a tame flower. 
RENA RuTH RussELL. First Year.

The bloodroot grows in rich, damp woods. 
The root is hard and thick, and has red juice. The stem is 
smooth and round and long, and of a reddish color. 
The leaf is round, and has from five to seven lobes. There 
is only one simple leaf on a stem. The leaf is smooth. The 
flower is like a white star. 
There is only two sepals. There are two rows of petals. 
There are four in each row. There are many stamens. There 
is only one pistil. 
HeILMA Nitsen. First Year. 
ANEMONE. 
The anemone is the earliest of all the flowers in the spring. 
The root of the anemone is like sweet potatoes. The roots 
keep the food in the winter time, and in the spring feed the 
yittle new leaves. The stem of the anemone is long, round, and 
smooth. At the end of the stem is a whorl of leaves. The 
leaves are compound. 
At the end of the flower-stem is a number of flowers. The 
anemone has from five to fifteen sepals. ‘There are many sta- 
mens which carry the pollen. There are many pistils. They 
catch the pollen as it falls. Below the flowers is a whorl of 
leaves like a collar.

The children said I was a tap-root. Tap is a nickname for 
tapering. 
James Byrnes. First Year. 
  
Would you like to know about the dandelion leaf? 
The parts of it are the blade and petiole. 
The blade is long, green, and flat. 
The blade is deep cut. 
The midrib and petiole are long. 
The midrib is thick. 
The petiole is short, and grows lighter-colored towards the 
root. The dandelion leaves are good to eat. 
Douctas Kincarp. First Year. 
  
Miss B. gave me a dandelion stem, with a flower. 
The stem is long. 
It is a light-yellowish green. 
It is cylindrical, smooth, and hollow. 
Miss B. told us to trisect the stem. 
There is sap inside. 
It is like milk. 
We can curl the stem. 
It tastes very bitter. 
Ray SmitH. First Year. 
  
Willie and Hollis brought us some dandelion flowers to study 
about in school, and we had a lesson about it. 
The dandelion blossom has hundreds of little flowers in one 
blossom. 
There are five petals, but they are so close together that it 
looks like one. 
There are five stamens, but they are so close together that it 
looks like a little tube around Mrs. Pistil. 
Mrs. Pistil is longer than the stamens are.
-P-A-G-E-63

  Mrs. Pistil has two little mouths on the top of her head, and 
when the bugs or the bee does not come, Mrs. Pistil has to curl 
her mouths to get the pollen herself.

other lawns. 
I would like to go over with the other dandelions. Perhaps 
the wind will take me some day. 
WILLIE CAWLEY. First Year. 
JACK-IN-THE-PULPIT. 
Jack-in-the-Pulpit grows in the woods near a dampy place, 
and we find the blossoms in under Jack, and we find the 
blossoms in May. 
It grows about a foot high. We call it Jack-in-the-Pulpit 
because it looks like a little man in the pulpit. It is called 
spadix and spathe. Jack is called spadix, and the pulpit is 
called spathe. The corm is called Indian Turnip, and it is 
called Indian Turnip because under the roots is a hard corm 
which is sometimes called Indian Turnip. 
The roots are fibrous, and grows right above the corm. 
Jack has got compound leaves, and with parallel veins in it. 
And it is folded in a leaf. There are two kinds of flowers ; 
some flowers have stamens, and some have pistils, and they do 
not grow on the same plant. 
THERESA ANDERSEN. (Nine years old.) 
BLUE VIOLET. 
It grows in the woods where the dirt is not very dry, and 
sometimes in moist places. It is low, and it blooms in spring.
-P-A-G-E-64
  64 NATURE STUDY. 
  
It has a fibrous root, and there are many. It grows in a 
thick bunch at the top of the root. 
The leaves are palmately veined ; they are heart-shaped, and 
each has a stem of its own. 
The corolla is dark blue; the lower petal has a spur; it is 
furry, and has dark-blue lines, and there are five petals to the 
corolla. 
The calyx is green; it hangs down like a little ear. There 
are five stamens, and they are green on the lower part and 
orange color on the upper part. 
The pistil is green, and it has a round top.

BUDS. 
On some twigs the buds are alternate, and on others they are 
opposite. 
When the buds are opposite they look like this [drawing], 
and when they are alternate they are like this [drawing]. 
Just below each bud I can see where the leaf dropped off 
last fall. After the leaves had gone away last fall, the tree 
and the buds went to sleep, and slept all winter. 
As soon as the spring came and the sap began to flow, the 
little buds pushed out their heads in the warm sunshine. 
The little bud cradles are made of brown scales. 
GERTRUDE SHERMAN. Third Year. 
THE BEAN. 
When I opened the bean I saw two little white leaves and a 
white sprout. It looked like this picture [drawing]. 
When the bean is planted, the white sprout goes down and 
makes the root, and two little leaves will come up, and the 
bean. 
When the bean comes up it is in two parts, and two little 
_ leaves come up, and they are the bean. 
I will show you the picture of the next plant [drawing]. 
After a while the little leaves that were in the bean will grow 
up ina little plant. The two halves of the bean will get green 
and brown, and as soon as they are brown they fall off.

THE BEAN. 
When I split my bean open I saw two little leaves and a 
little sprout. The color of the leaves and the sprout are white. 
It looks like this [drawing]. 
When the bean is planted, the sprout grows down and makes 
the root, and the bean and the leaves grow up.

When the bean comes up it separates in two parts. Just 
between the two parts of the bean the same two little leaves 
are there. This is the way it looks [drawing]. 
After a while the leaves get bigger, and it looks this way 
[drawing]. 
By and by the two halves dropped off because they had no 
more food in them. 
CATHERINE LouGEE. Third Year. 
THE BEAN. 
When I looked inside of the bean I saw two little white 
leaves and a small sprout. I think you will like to see a picture 
of the inside of the bean. 
When the bean is put in the ground the little white root goes 
down to the dark earth, and the little leaves steam, and the 
bean comes up to see the sunshine. 
When the bean comes out of the ground it opens, and the 
same beans come up between the two parts. I will show you 
a picture of it. 
When the leaves are real large they look like this. 
After a while the beans get green, and then they wither and 
fall off. 
AGNES GLESSNER. Third Year. 
THE GERANIUM. 
The geranium is a house and garden plant. It is an herb 
which grows one to four feet high. 
We use the geranium to make our home look bright. The 
parts of the geranium are root, stem, leaves, and flowers. It 
has a fibrous root which looks like little threads. The stem is 
long, round, woody, erect, juicy, and diffuse. 
It has a brownish green stem covered with hairs. 
The leaves grow alternately from the nodes on the stem,
-P-A-G-E-67
  LESSONS ON PLANTS. 67 
  
The parts of the leaves are, blade, petiole, and stipules. 
The blade is green, kidney-shaped ; it has a scalloped, lobed 
margin, and is palmately veined. 
It is covered with little hairs, which make it feel soft and 
velvety. The petiole is round and slender. The stipules are 
two little green leaves at the base of the petiole. 
ALICE PETERSON. (Eleven years old.) 
THE RUE ANEMONE. 
The anemone is found near the edge of woods, in the month 
of May. It has a fleshy root. 
The stem is smooth and slender, it is short, and the color is 
green or brownish. 
It has a cluster of leaves growing in underneath the blos- 
soms in a circle’ called the involucre. 
The blossoms grow inclusters ; it has no corolla; it has from 
five to ten sepals, — in my blossom there are five sepals; and 
there are many stamens. 
It has seven pistils ; the color is purple. 
BERNARD BENSON. Third Year. 
GERANIUM AND OXALIS. 
The leaves of both are net-veined. They both have short 
petioles. Their colors are green. The two blossoms grow in 
clusters. They both have five petals and five sepals. The sepals 
are pointed. The geranium and oxalis have ten stamens and 
one pistil. They are both house plants. The root of the 
geranium is fibrous, and the root of the oxalis grows in a 
bulb. 
The geranium has a simple leaf, and the oxalis has a com- 
pound leaf. The geranium is kidney-shaped, and the oxalis 
is heart-shaped.
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 NATURE STUDY. 
  
The geranium has a scalloped margin, and the oxalis has a 
smooth margin. The blossom of the geranium is larger than 
the oxalis blossom. The petals of the geranium are separate. 
The petals of the oxalis are joined together. 
ANNIE BJORNSEN. Third Year. 
THE DANDELION. 
Early in spring we can see this brave little plant. A few 
days of warm sunshine is all he wants. After a while he will 
meet us with his bright golden face. Because of its bright 
color and sweet perfume the blossom is very attractive to bees, 
butterflies, and children. 
Because it is so common it is not loved by some people. 
The gardeners don’t like the dandelion because it is so hard to 
dig up. The root of the dandelion is very large. It has a 
thick middle part that sends out other small roots. The dan- 
delion has long, green, slender, deeply cut leaves. 
It has a yellow flower which consists of many little flowers. 
When the petals fall off, a circle of down forms, and changes 
the flowers into a pretty little balloon. 
IpA MELIN. Third Year. 
THE GERANIUM. 
The geranium grows wild in the southern part of Africa. 
The geranium has a fibrous root, — it is called fibrous because 
it is like threads. The stem is. upright, and the branches 
spread. The shape of the stem is round, it is green, and it 
is covered with soft hair. One leaf is on each node; they are 
on opposite sides of the stem. We call these leaves alternate. 
The shape of the geranium blade is reniform, or kidney-shape. 
The margin of the leaf is crenate. The veins start from the 
petiole, and they spread like the fingers on our hands. The
-P-A-G-E-69
LESSONS ON PI.ANTS. 69 
leaf feels very soft. It is so soft because it has soft hairs on 
it. We find on the stem near the petiole are the stipules or 
scales. The little scales become dry and drop off. The gera- 
nium flower is in a cluster; they look like an umbrella, and 
they are called an umbel. The calyx has five sepals; the 
color is green, and the shape of it is more of a pointed shape. 
We find near the largest sepal there is a little hole called the 
honey-tube. The corolla has five petals, and the colors are 
different. There are three large ones and two smaller. There 
are seven to ten stamens, and one pistil ; we find on the end of 
the pistil five little curls. 
Oxca Peterson. Third Year. 
THE PASQUE-FLOWER. 
The pasque-flower is found in March, and sometimes it is 
found in April first. It is sometimes found on the sunny hill- 
sides, and sometimes in the woods under the trees. 
The root is found under the earth. It is called the under- 
ground stem, and in winter it is under ground all the winter. 
The stem is hollow, so that it can take up food from the 
earth. The stem outside is round, and it has on it soft hairs 
like down. 
On the stem, a little way up, is a kind. of cup called the 
involucre. 
The leaves do not come until after the blossom dies down. 
Then the leaves start to come up from the root. 
The blossom is very beautiful. Inside of the blossom are 
some little fine hairs, and at the end are some little bags. 
Inside of the blossom are some little pistils which catch the 
dust, and the dust goes down into a little passage which is 
called the ovary, which holds the seed.

Knocks at the tiny door,

And some fell upon a rock, and as soon as it was sprung up 
it withered away because it lacked moisture. 
And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with 
it and choked it. 
And other fell on good ground, and sprang up and bare fruit

PEAS. 
We were going to plant peas in the can. 
We first soaked the peas. We soaked them so they would 
sprout sooner. 
If we dig up a pea that has been planted three days, we find 
2 funny little sprout coming out of it. It is called the stemlet.
-P-A-G-E-71
  LESSONS ON PLANTS. 71 
  
The seed leaves of the pea stay in the ground. They are to 
give food to the plant. They give food to the plant till the 
plant has strong enough roots to take its own food. 
In a few days the stemlet sends three or four roots down into 
the ground. A little bud rises out of the ground. It soon 
turns into the real leaves of the plant.

THE SWEET-PEA. 
I am a sweet-pea. I grew in a garden. I am purple and 
pink. One day a little girl came and picked me. The little 
girl took me home to her mother because I was so pretty. Her 
mother put me in a glass of water, and said I was a sweet smell- 
ing flower. 
There were some more sweet-peas out in the garden, and a 
little rose-bush by it. I wonder if the little girl picked a 
rosebud. Nina L. Wituiams. First Year. 
STORY OF THE BEAN. 
When I was young I lived in a long, green house and had 
five little sisters. In this house there were six rooms. There 
were no doors, but arches, one at each room. 
We wore green dresses, and we used to sit along the side of 
the house. Our house had no windows, so we did not see what 
was around us. One day we heard a man and a boy witha 
pail. 
The boy was just about to pick our house with us in it, when 
we heard the man say, “ Jimmy, don’t pick those beans ; we’ll 
let them go to seed ;”” but we did not know what going to seed 
meant. 
When we grew older, we wore lighter dresses and lived in a 
brown house. One day when we were very thirsty, and the 
house was very dry, it cracked, and we tumbled out. Then we
-P-A-G-E-72
72 NATURE STUDY. 
  saw what was around us. We saw that our house was on a vine, 
and the vine was climbing a pole. 
Then we saw the man and the boy with a basket; and the 
boy said, “ Look ; the beans are all over the ground.” Then 
he picked us up, and we were put away in a dark place, where 
we went to sleep. 
The next spring we heard the man say, “Come, Jimmy ; we 
will plant those beans.” And we were put into the warm, moist 
earth, and in three or four days we sprouted. 
LEILA WITcHIE. Second Year. 
AN ACORN STORY. 
I am an acorn, and my mother is an oak-tree, and I have 
lots and lots of brothers and sisters. 
We all live in the dark, cool forest. There are not many 
people out here in the forest, only hunters and trappers. I have 
to hang on with all my might now, because if I didn’t I would 
tumble. 
Last night I almost fell off; and I think I shall let go next 
time, to see where I shall go to. 
Well, I let go this morning; so here I am on the ground 
without my snug little cradle. It is getting so cold that it makes 
me shiver nearly all the time. I got so chilled that my skin is 
broken. Oh dear, how I wish I had stayed with my mother! 
It is night; and here I am in a dreadful storm, being driven 
into the ground by the rain and hail. 
Now I am in the dark ground with my skin broken, and J 
am afraid I shall never see my mother again. 
There is a little embryo inside of me, with a little root and 
stem. But now I am glad I did not stay with my mother in my 
old home, because I am growing up just a little way from her. 
If I am patient, and no one cuts me down, after many years 
I will be a grand old oak, just like my dear mother, out here in 
the cool, dark forest.

a, 
THE MORNING-GLORY. 
The morning-glory is a dicotyledonous or exogenous plant, 
because it has two cotyledons or seed-leaves. 
The pod is round, and has three cells, with two seeds in each 
cell. The calyx adheres to the pod. 
The seed is covered with a brown coat or covering. In the 
seed we see the embryo and the albumen. The albumen is 
stored around the cotyledons instead of in them, as it is in the 
bean and pea. The cotyledons are all rolled up when in the 
seed, but are of quite a good shape. When the seed is green 
the albumen is soft and gummy, and of a light-pink color. It 
would not keep this way; so as the seed ripens the albumen 
hardens. The plumule cannot be seen, but it is there ; and if 
you soak a morning-glory seed you will see it. 
The three cells in the pod show that there are three pistils 
in the blossom. 
The root is small and fibrous; it is of a light-brown color, 
and has little rootlets. These rootlets get mineral food from 
the ground. 
The radicle is the part that grows between the root and the co- 
tyledons. The plumule is the leaf-bud between the cotyledons. 
The stem is round and green; it is jointed, slightly hollow, 
and slightly wooded. There are little hairs on it which all 
point downward. 
The leaves are heart-shaped, and have an entire margin, 
and are net-veined. They are attached to the large stem by 
tiny stems called petioles. The leaves are simple, and grow 
alternately. 
The flower grows in the axil of the leaf. Its parts are the 
stamens and pistils, the corolla, and the calyx. It is mono- 
petalous, and is funnel-shaped. The corolla is not divided, but 
there are five lines which show where it might be divided. 
The filaments of the stamens are fastened to the corolla. 
There are three pistils which are joined up to the stigma.
-P-A-G-E-74
  
74 NATURE STUDY. 
The blossom opens early in the morning, and then closes for 
the day. 
The fruit of the morning-glory is dehiscent, because, when it 
is ripe, the pod breaks open and scatters the seeds. It is a plant 
that lives one year. The morning-glory seeds are planted, and 
the blossoms are used for bouquets. 
HELEN L. Moony. Fifth Year. 
CLOVER LEAF. 
Leaves are flat and thin green bodies that make the foliage of 
plants and trees. 
The leaf of the clover is divided into three little leaflets, and 
on account of this is sometimes called trefoil. 
The leaflets are oval in shape, with a midrib up the centre, 
and many little veinlets branching out from it. 
At the bottom of the stem the stipules grow fast to the leaf- 
stalk. 
The upward face of each little leaflet is soft like velvet, and 
the under side is lined with soft silky hairs. 
A field of clover makes a pretty carpet of green for a lawn; 
and when the sweet blossoms come in June it is a pretty sight, 
and fills the air with fragrance. 
——. Third Year. 
MINNEAPOLIS, May 8, 1890. 
Dear Miss Gowpy, — This week we have had a lesson on 
the clover. I thought it was a beautiful lesson, so I shall try 
and write you what I can remember about it. 
The clover is a little plant that grows very near the ground, 
with many little stems growing from its fibrous root. 
On the top of each little stem there are three little leaflets. 
The blossoms also grow on a long stem in the shape of an oval. 
There are many little flowers in one head, and our teacher
-P-A-G-E-75
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 75 
  said the bees call them the horns of plenty. I guess they do 
that because each little flower has so much honey in it. 
When the clover-blossom comes I pick a little basket full, 
and then sit down on the grass and pull them to pieces, so I 
can suck the honey out of each little flower. 
When the blossoms wither they do not fall off, but stay in the 
calyx. 
I cannot remember any more, dear Miss Gowdy, so good-by, 
Your loving pupil,

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN., Dec. 14, 1892. 
Dear Aunt, — We have been studying about trees, and I want 
to write and tell you about one I see every day on my way to 
school. I call it a linden, but some people call it a basswood. 
There are many lindens along the streets in Minneapolis. 
The trunk of the linden is very straight. The bark is rough 
and dark-gray in color. The inner bark is very thick. They 
use it in making mats and coarse rope. 
The wood is white and very soft. It is used in making 
dishes and furniture. 
The leaf is roundish, with a pointed apex and heart-shaped 
base. The leaf is very one-sided. 
The fruit looks like a bunch of grayish-pink peas on a long 
stem, which is joined to a long, narrow leaf like a wing. We 
_ had some in school, and they were very beautiful. 
The wind carries these wings about with the fruit hanging to 
them, so that new trees come up a long way from the mother

OAK LEAVES. 
There are three kinds of white oaks. We can tell them by 
their leaves, because they have short petioles and no bristly 
points on the leafmargin. The kinds of white-oak leaves are 
the bur, white, and swamp. 
I can tell each kind, because the bur has a large, thick, coarse, 
irregular-lobed leaf; the white oak is deeply lobed; and the 
swamp oak has quite a fine leaf with a waving margin. 
The petioles of all are short ; the blades are oval-shaped, net: 
veined, and have an entire margin, and vary in size. 
There are as many kinds of black oaks as white oaks, — the 
scarlet, red, and pin. The scarlet-oak leaf has a long petiole, 
having deep regular lobes, usually five in number. 
The red-oak leaf is very much like the scarlet, only it is large 
and has a short petiole. The pin oak has a small, fine, almost! 
skeleton leaf with a long petiole. Galls are often found on the 
leaf, caused by insects biting the leaf, and the sap forming a 
hard bunch. In the fall these leaves turn to beautiful shades ol 
ted, yellow, and brown.

OAKS. 
We have two species of oaks, the black, and the white. The 
different kinds of black oaks we have seen and studied are the 
scarlet oak, pin oak, and red oak; and the different kinds of 
white oaks are the bur oak, swamp white oak, and the real 
white oak. 
Both grow in about the same soil and climate, and both are 
about the same size, only the white oaks have the thicker trunks. 
They both are the same shape, with far-spreading branches, but 
the branches of the white oaks are more irregular, and so give 
larger tops to the trees. They grow much faster than the black, 
but do not live so long.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
LESSONS ON PLANTS. 7 
  
The bark of both is rough, that of the black oaks being dark 
and deeply furrowed, while the others have a light, scaly bark, 
which is easier to pick off, and thinner. The inside bark of 
both is rough, dark-yellow, and that of the black is used for 
tanning. 
The wood of the black oaks is heavier, darker colored, and 
is much coarser grained than the white. The wood of the oaks 
which grow here is used mostly for fuel and posts, as it is too 
coarse for other uses ; but some kinds of oaks are used a great 
deal for furniture, inside work on houses, and parts of ships. 
The foliage of the white oaks is heavier than the black, and 
the leaves are larger and thicker. The leaves of the black oaks 
are a bright, glossy green, while those of the white oaks are a 
light dull-green. Most of the black oak leaves have deeper 
lobes than the white, and the lobes are sharp and bristle-pointed, 
while those of the white are round and smooth. The veining 
in both is alike. 
The bitter acorns of all the black oaks have smooth cups, 
while the sweet ones of the white oaks have rough cups, some- 
times fringy at the top. 
The leaves of both turn to many beautiful colors in the early 
autumn ; but later, after the heavy frosts come, they turn to 
a dark brown, and those of the white oaks fall, but those of 
the black oaks stay on all winter, and fall as the new buds 
begin to come in the. spring. 
The black oaks sometimes have a light-green ball, which is 
called an oak-ball or oak-apple. It is formed by little insects. 
The white oaks do not have these, but have a smaller ball on 
the leaves and small twigs, which is called the oak-gall. It has 
inside of it a little egg about as large as a pea, and inside of 
that is a little fly all curled up for winter. Ink is made from 
some oak-galls,

ment. Surfaces, — smooth, woolly, hairy, etc. Terms taught 
when they are necessary to accurate description. Add parts 
of flower, — calyx, sepals, corolla, petals, stamens, pistil. 
Pupils should give connected descriptions. 
Grape III. 
Review and continue previous work. Describe different 
flowers, and collect specimens. In spring study trees of 
Minneapolis. Watch the development of leaf buds. Note 
covering and arrangement. Study shape and arrangement of 
leaves, qualities and uses of fruit, time of ripening. Learn to 
distinguish and name familiar trees. Observe the germination 
of seeds, and the growth of young plants. In fall add to the 
study of fall flowers observation of seeds and fruits. Make 
list of those observed, and note resemblances and differences. 
In this and the following grades the pupils should record their 
observations in note-books.

  III. LESSONS ON ANIMALS. 
STUDY OF INSECTS. 
The first step in the observation of insects is to 
lead the children to recognize the characteristic marks, 
or at least those which their own eyes can easily deter- 
mine. Small animals, no internal skeleton, body in 
three segments, covered with a horny skin; three pairs 
of legs attached to middle segment, usually two pairs 
of wings. The children should collect specimens, 
observe and compare, until these points of general 
resemblances have been fixed in their minds. Then 
they may examine individuals more minutely, record- 
ing the results of their observation. Following the 
study of a single specimen should come the comparison 
of specimens which differ. The question emphasized 
should be “ Why?” as soon as the “What?” has been 
answered. The teacher should guard against telling the 
children what she has seen, instead of leading them to 
see for themselves. Her questions should be definite 
and direct, requiring thoughtful answers. 
The preparation of material is the first step in the 
lesson. While the pupils should ,be encouraged to 
make collections for themselves, the teacher should not 
trust to these for her material. She should obtain for 
herself enough specimens to supply her class. The 
only needed apparatus for catching the insects will be 
the butterfly net and a pair of hands. They may be
-P-A-G-E-81
LESSONS ON ANIMALS. 81 
killed easily and quickly by placing them in a wide- 
mouthed bottle containing a preparation of cyanide 
of potassium. A few cents’ worth should be placed 
in the bottle, covered with water, and enough plaster 
of Paris added to form a coating through which the 
fumes can escape. This bottle should be kept tightly 
_ corked, and distinctly labelled “ Poison.” 
For mounting specimens, use a wooden or stout 
pasteboard box, and glue to the bottom small pieces 
of cork. Cut stoppers in layers for this purpose. Use 
needles or slender pins. A particular kind of pin may 
be bought for this purpose, if the collection is elaborate. 
Insects gathered in quantities, and needed for class use, 
may be preserved in alcohol. They should be dried 
before using. Butterflies cannot, of course, be so 
treated; they may be folded in paper. 
OUTLINE. 
Children who have observed animal life during the 
first three years of school life will be ready for the 
detailed study suggested in the following outline: —

STUDY OF THE GRASSHOPPER. 
A common insect, found everywhere in the grass; 
green, yellow, or brown; having a tube-like body from 
one to two inches long (according to specimens seen). 
This body is in three parts: head, thorax, abdomen. 
Find and name parts. 
HEAD. — The head is long and narrow, and moves 
very easily, There are two large compound eyes on 
the sides of the head. (Use microscope if possible.) 
A pair of jointed feelers is attached to the head. There 
are two pairs of mouth parts. 
THORAX. — The thorax is in three bands; it seems 
almost flat above and below. Two pairs of wings are 
attached to the thorax. The outer pair are long, nar- 
row, and stiff, covering the inner; the inner wings are 
thin and delicate, and folded like a fan. These are of 
different colors. Some have a bright orange band at 
the edge. These inner wings are used in flying. There 
are three pairs of legs, one pair attached to each seg- 
ment. The hind legs are long, stout, pointed, stiff, and 
used for jumping. 
ABDOMEN. — The abdomen is long and slender, made 
of segments. In the sides of the segments or rings are 
openings showing the ends of the breathing-tubes. 
Hasits. — Grasshoppers feed upon the grass and 
leaves where they are found. They deposit their eggs 
in the ground or on twigs. The young have not full- 
grown wings. 
Why do children say, — 
“ Grasshopper, grasshopper, grasshopper gray, 
Give me some molasses, and I'’ll let you away”?

accustomed to the presence of children. Let it move 
about, and ask the children to observe its movements. 
Allow the children to feed it at suitable times. Com- 
pare with their cats at home. 
“What can cats do that you cannot do?” “They 
can catch mice and birds. They can climb trees. 
They can spring farther and run faster than we can. 
They can scratch and bite.” ‘What do they eat?” “I 
give my kitty bread and milk and meat.” ‘“ How does 
she drink the milk?” “She laps it with her tongue.” 
“If you should not feed her, would she go without 
food?” ‘No; she catches mice or birds.” ‘Let us 
see how she is fitted to do these things; why she is a 
good mouse-catcher; why she needs to spring and to 
run.”

EGGS. 
I have seen a collection of eggs. They were all different 
shapes and sizes, and some are blue, and white with brown 
spots, and some are brown. We have a hen’s egg in school. 
We broke a little of the shell off, and it was very brittle and 
- smooth. On the inside there is some white lining, and when 
you pull it it will stretch. 
Next to the skin there is the white part of the egg, and it is 
a little thicker than water. 
Next to the white part it is yellow, and they call it the yolk. 
Little chickens come out of hen’s eggs.

A BULL-HEAD. 
A bull-head has a large mouth and a large head. His body 
tapers and is brownish-green. 
His fins are to help him swim, and he has three, — one on 
each side, and one on his back. 
They are made out of thin skin, and bones under the skin. 
On the other side of the body it is white. He makes his 
gill go out and in all the time. 
He has whiskers, but they look like horns. He has three 
teeth, and one is on his tongue. 
The tail is fan-shape, with fringe at the end. He is very 
slippery, and if you pick him up he feels like a piece of ice. 
He has no scales, but tough skin, and was caught in the 
Mississippi river.

THE RABBIT. 
I have been looking at two cute little rabbits, and I thought 
I would tell you something about them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
94 NATURE STUDY. 
  
They are in a cage on Miss Taylor’s table, but they like the 
home that they make themselves. The home that they make is 
called a burrow, that is under the ground. 
They were eating a little while ago, and they would put their 
little front paws upon the box, and put their little heads into 
the box and eat. 
‘They bite their paws. When they wash their faces they stick 
out their tongue and lap their paws, then it washes its face. 
One of them is very particular, it seems to me. 
He takes the box that his food is in and puts it up close to 
the corner, and that does not suit him. So he moves it again 
till it suits him. 
They gnaw all the wood they can find. 
One is white, and the other is white spotted with gray. They 
are nearly as large as a cat. They are covered with fur which 
is nearly an inch long. 
The rabbit is a vertebrate, because it has a back-bone. 
The head is very pretty in shape. The ears are long, and 
pink inside. I can see the little red veins running through 
the ears. It has beautiful large, round eyes, and when the sun 
is bright the eyes are like garnets. Their teeth are long, and 
they look like pearl. They have four on the upper jaw, and 
two on the lower jaw. 
I can see the tracks in the winter. They look so cunning 
hopping around. I have seen them stand up on their hind 
legs and curl their front legs up. 
They run wild by our house, and even on the sidewalk. I 
have watched them play around in the lumber-yards. I think 
they are very quick in their motions. With such long ears they 
can hear exceedingly well. 
My grandpa had two rabbits and a cat when I was down there, 
and after a while the cat and rabbits were friends. When the cat 
was asleep the rabbit would jump over the cat. And they would 
put their paws on her and lie down beside her. It was very 
cunning to see them, but they ran away before we came home.

Leaped aside and at a distance 
Sat erect upon his haunches, 
Half in fear and half in frolic, 
Saying to the little hunter, 
‘Do not shoot me, Hiawatha.’”

THE BUTTERFLY. 
The butterfly lives only one season. Its body is rather slim, 
and is divided into three parts — head, thorax, and abdomen. 
The body is covered with little scales. The head is set on so 
that it can move freely. 
On the head are two large compound eyes. With these eyes 
he can see in all directions. And placed between these eyes 
are three simple eyes, hidden by the little hairs on the head. 
Its feelers are fine, like hairs, but have knobs on the end. They 
act as a sense of touch. 
The mouth parts are so small that they cannot be seen only 
through a microscope, but we find they are very curious, — the 
under lips being drawn down to form a long, hollow proboscis, 
which the butterfly thrusts into the longest and narrowest flowers 
for honey. 
The upper lips are hairy, and when the butterfly does not 
use its proboscis, it rolls it up, and the upper lips protect it. 
The butterfly drinks its food, so that makes it a drinker. Its 
food is chiefly honey. 
Attached to the thorax are different appendages, — the legs 
and the wings. There are three pairs of jointed legs. This 
insect is not a walker, seldom using its legs, only when eating or 
resting. 
There are two pairs of wings, and they are covered with dust 
which looks like scales. 
These scales give the wings their color. Their wings are
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 NATURE STUDY. 
stretched a little network of threads. It uses its wings, and not 
its legs for moving about. . 
The upper and lower wings are not hooked together, like 
that of the moth. Its wings are called vans. Their wings are 
very bright and pretty. The upper wings of the butterfly are 
the widest, and they have smooth edges, and are triangular in 
shape. The lower wings of the butterfly are rounded, and have 
not such smooth edges as the upper wings. 
True butterflies fly only in the daytime, and not at night. 
They come out at about nine o’clock, and go to their hiding- 
place about four or five o’clock in the afternoon. They also 
hide away on a rainy day. 
The wings are painted with very pretty colors. The rainbow 
colors can be found on most every butterfly except a few. 
When the butterfly rests, its wings are held up; and as the 
upper side is the brightest they are protected, because the 
under part is generally the color of the flowers on which they 
feed, or the color of a dry leaf. It is also protected when 
flying, for it travels in a zigzag direction through the air. 
The butterfly goes through all the changes, — from an egg 
to a larva, then it is a chrysalis, and finally an imago, or perfect !

THE LAND-TORTOISE, OR MUD-TURTLE. 
(Told to teacher.) 
I found my turtle under a piece of paper on the sidewalk. 
When I brought it home it ran around in the water. Then we 
took it out, and she walked on the floor. It was three inches 
long. It was a little one. 
The mud-turtle has four legs. It has a sharp tail. When 
you take him by the head the head sneaks in.

FABLE OF THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE, OR 
THE RABBIT AND THE TURTLE. 
(Oral, written down by teacher.) 
Once there was a rabbit by a creek, and he saw a mud-turtle. 
He said, “Do you want to try a race?” Then the rabbit 
laughed and said, “‘To-morrow at the noon we will have the 
race.” He came to-morrow at the noon and said, “ Let me try 
now the race.” The rabbit ran fast, and the mud-turtle went 
not so fast. The rabbit laid down by a stone to sleep. And 
the mud-turtle went by the rabbit, and he began to laugh. 
Then the rabbit woke up, and he go on, and go on, to the 
place, and when he got there, there the mud-turtle was. 
And the mud-turtle laugh because he beat him on the race.

All creatures both great and small, 
For the dear God who loveth us 
He made and loveth all.” 
The rabbits lives in the woods in little holes. He is covered 
with soft fur, gray and white. The rabbit’s head is just like a 
egg shape. His eyes shine, they are kind of gray. His ears 
are long, and they lay down when you don’t call him. When 
you do, he puts them up. His mouth is cut in half; it looks 
like three lips, two above and one below. He has four long, 
sharp teeth, so he can cut and gnaw. His nose looks just like 
he’s shivering. His whiskers are white and long. He has a 
body soft. His tail is short, and he curves it up. The rabbit's

legs are short in front and long in back. He has five toes in 
front and four in back. They have life in them to go fast. 
He has scratchers in his toes.

HABITS OF A RABBIT. 
The wild rabbit lives in the woods. He lives in holes down | 
in the ground; sometimes they make it, sometimes they find 
holes made. He eats cabbage, grass, tender bark, and leaves. 
When he runs he hops. 
He lies down and puts his feet all under him. 
When he washes his face he sits up on his two hind feet, and 
he uses his front paws just like we use our hands. I know 
because he is in the schoolroom and I saw him wash his face. 
The rabbit is white in winter, the color of the snow. He is 
gray in summer.

ADVENTURES OF A RABBIT. 
(Verbatim report of story as reproduced by a child.) 
Once there was a rabbit and he run away, and his father told 
him not to come back till he could stay in his own little bed. 
And his father said, “ Though you should cry and beg all day, I 
won’t let you come home again.” 
He lived far in the wild woods. He had three brothers and 
two sisters. He ran away every day. 
He met little Bossy Whitefoot. She was eating grass in a 
field, and thinking of the days when she would be a cow. She 
trotted on her toes, and saw two frightened eyes. The rabbit 
said, “It is late, I must be going.” 
The next he knew he met a goat, and the goat cried, 
“Intruder, hold! I'll bunt you, if you don’t get off my 
reek.” And the goat was tired of waiting, and he started —
-P-A-G-E-99
LESSONS ON ANIMALS. 99 
  
and there was nothing to do but stand and stare. All he saw 
was the spot, with nothing on it. The rabbit had run away, 
and there was nothing but a pair of flying feet and just a little 
part of an eye. 
Four little lambs, running by, called to the rabbit to come 
and play with them in that pretty spot of clover. 
Then there was a bellow and a snort close to his heels, and 
a great big bull tried to catch him. There’s no telling whether 
he will get away, but he does, 
He hears a whinner and a snort, and a pony kicked up his 
heels, pretending to play ; and the rabbit cried, “I ain’t come 
to play.” 
Close to his heels there came a pack of flying dogs. ‘That 
was the worst thing of all. He goes in a hole in the fence, 
and the dogs stare at his toes —and they didn’t see his toes 
very long. 
He met three children, and one tried to feed him clover 
while another tried to catch him with a rope and a string, and 
a ketch knot on the end. He got away, and ran on and on 
when all other young things were going to bed. When you 
hear the wind, it’s the little rabbit rushing here and there ; and 
when the rain goes pit-a-pat, it’s his feet pattering by. 
RAYMOND BarreETT. (Seven years old.) 
THE HEN. 
The hen is one of the most useful birds that there is. The 
hen has very small wings for such a large bird, because they do 
not fly. The rooster has larger wattles and comb than the hen. 
The bill has a little hook on the end, so that they can pick up 
the food that they eat. The hen has a very small tail for such 
a large bird. The hen’s feet are not like the duck’s, because 
they do not swim. The hen has nails so that they can scratch ; 
because the hen scratches she belongs to the scratcher family. 
The colors are black, white, gray, and brown. When the hens 
set it takes about three weeks for the egg to hatch. Just after 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  100 NATURE STUDY. 
the chickens are hatched, they have no feathers on; they have 
down. The hen eats corn, bread, wheat, stones, and little 
pieces of glass. After the hen eats her food it goes to the 
crop, then it goes to the gizzard, then it gets ground up. 
The hens have to have stones to help grind up the food. 
When we lived in the country we had a hen that would lay 
eggs without shells on, in the winter. People burn bones for 
them to eat, because they cannot get anything in the winter 
time to make the egg-shells. We eat the hens and their eggs, 
and make cake out of the eggs. 
ALVIN CAMPBELL. Second Year. 
THE CRAB. 
The crab is an articulate, because it has a jointed skeleton. 
Its eyes are placed on two stalks, so it can see all around. Its 
eyes are compound. The crab has five pairs of legs. The 
front legs have a large pair of pincers that it uses to catch 
its prey with. 
The crab walks sideways. There are several kinds of crabs. 
The land crab, hermit crab. 
The crab sheds its shell every year. The shell splits open 
on the back, and sometimes the crab leaves some of its legs on 
the shell. 
The female crab carries her eggs on her abdomen. If you 
touch the crabs, they will put their tails under them and 
walk off.

THE HOUSEKEEPER. 
The frugal snail, with forecast of repose, 
Carries his house with him where’er he goes; 
Peeps out, and if there comes a shower of rain, 
Retreats to his small domicile amain.

Touch but a tip of him, a horn, ’tis well — 
He curls up in his sanctuary shell. 
Copied by Myra Rosinson. Third Year. 
THE SNAIL. 
The snail has a soft body, and lives in a shell. The snail 
lives in warm and damp places, such as by the walks of gardens 
and parks. They carry their shell on their back when they are 
out of it. When they want to go in the shell, they pull back 
their feelers, and their body will go in the shell again. 
They eat most of the time in the night, and could spoil a 
whole garden in one night. 
When cold weather draws near, they crawl under a log or 
stone, and go in their shell and cover the open places with a 
curtain. 
This is made pretty thin, so that they can breathe. 
AN OYSTER’S REFLECTIONS. 
Two years ago I was a very small oyster. There were 
thousands of us, and we were no larger than particles of dust. 
After we were hatched, mother thought it best to keep us in 
her shell until we were big enough to start out for ourselves. 
One day, out we all ran ; there were so many that we made the 
water yellow. Some of my brothers were carried away by the 
undercurrent, and some of them attached themselves to rocks, 
and I found this branch of a tree firmly imbedded in the sand. 
One day some of my oyster friends closed their shells 
because they saw a boat above them. 
Pretty soon an oyster-dredge was let down, and tore my 
brothers from their homes. , 
We oysters have many enemies, — lobsters and crabs will 
make a meal of us; star-fishes like us, too.

A LOBSTER’S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF. 
I would like to tell some of the land folks that my color is 
not as it is after being boiled. Such folks could not have lived 
on the seashore, and seen fishermen bringing in the lobster-pots 
with blackishing lobsters inside. 
We lobsters don’t look like our mother. We stay with our 
mother till we are about six inches long. If we get alarmed, 
we run under mother and hide. We change our shells in hot 
weather, and shed our old ones. New ones grow on, about one 
third bigger. 
I have nineteen pairs of gills,and four pairs of legs, and a 
lot of teeth in my stomach. 
Well, my dinner hour has come, and I will go and get some 
clams. I need not depend on my stomach teeth. I have 
teeth in my claws, too. 
Joun H. Bocart. Third Year. 
A CRAB’S ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF. 
We crabs wear our bones on the outside. It is the best way, 
because we do not get so many bumps and knocks. 
I am afraid of getting hurt just now, for the other day I 
backed out of my shell. I am making a new dress, out of 
lime which I get from the seawater. We change our shells 
once a year. 
I look very different from what I did when I was a baby. 
Wise men did not know what to call me, but thought I was a 
new kind of a water-animal. 
When I get big enough, I shall stop changing my shell. 
You can hardly tell my head from my body. I have my shell 
to protect my body.

  THE FISH. 
The fish’s body is long and thin, and the tail is fan-shaped. 
Tt does not walk, because it has no feet. It gets along in the 
water by swimming. ‘The fish’s body is covered with scales, 
which are transparent. It feeds on worms, grubs, and other 
fish smaller than itself. Fishes breathe through gills, instead 
of lungs as we do. Fishes open and shut their mouths 
because water is all the time passing through it. The gills 
sift the air from the water. 
It takes the water in through its mouth, and lets it out by its 
gills. Their scales overlap each other, and point toward the 
tail. The fish has six fins. The scales are nearly round, and 
the edge is scalloped. The fish’s tail is shaped like a fan, so 
that it can use it like an oar. We call the fish a cold-blooded 
animal, because it feels the same way the water feels that 
it is put into. The fish’s mouth is very large, and it has a small 
_ red tongue. 
Erne, Heatu. Third Year. 
A fish is not like a crab, because it has a backbone and a 
crab has a jointed body. An oyster is not like a crab, because 
a crab’s shell is jointed, and an oyster’s shell has two parts. 
A star-fish has no backbone like a fish, and no jointed body 
like a lobster’s. 
It is not like an oyster, because its parts come from the 
centre.

  OUTLINE OF ANIMAL LESSONS. 
Grave I. 
Observe and describe familiar animals, selecting such as may 
be studied to advantage in the schoolroom. ‘The cat, dog, 
rabbit, gopher, and squirrel are illustrations. Lessons on the 
cow and horse, given from pictures, should be supplemented 
by wisely directed observation outside the schoolreom. Use 
the cases prepared for studying live specimens. Study cover- 
ing, parts of body, food, habits, and care of young. The feet 
and teeth should be observed carefully. Kindness to animals, 
and proper care of domestic animals, should be emphasized in 
these lessons. Give information which the observation of the 
children has made them ready to understand. Use stories of 
animals for Language Lessons when practicable. ‘Try to lead 
the children to observe outside the schoolroom. Work for 
definite and correct expression, but do not emphasize the 
expression so far as to draw the attention from the thought. 
Grape II. 
Study birds. Be sure in the observation that the attention is 
directed to the characteristics which belong to all birds. Note 
these characteristics as in the individuals studied, and so lead 
the pupils to the class idea. In selecting specimens, choose 
those which differ widely, as hen, duck, heron, owl, and robin. 
Study a nest, egg, feather, noting parts and arrangement of 
parts. In comparing birds, emphasize the structure of bill, 
legs, and wings. 
Grave III. 
Fish, lobster or crayfish, oyster, clam, and starfish. Make 
simple lists for classification, noting simple resemblances and
-P-A-G-E-105
LESSONS ON ANIMALS. 105 
  differences. In these lists use familiar animals only. Compare 
different animals, telling in what they are like and in what 
different. 
Grave IV. 
Build upon the preceding, and lead to classification of verte- 
brates into mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fishes. 
From chart, study man as a vertebrate. Group different orders, 
noting characteristics which mark the order, and make more 
definite study of one, as quadrupeds or birds. Hold to 
the principle, not to the fact of classification, and deduce the 
classification from the results of observation. Read to the 
pupils from “Animal Life in the Sea and on Land.” Study 
plan of Morse’s “ First Book.” 
GRADE V. 
Study crustaceans and insects as compared with vertebrates. 
Note the essential points of resemblance which determine their 
grouping. Divide insects according to the structure of wings. 
Study lobster from specimen, and compare with crayfish if 
possible. Note helps in Colton’s “Zodlogy,” and Morse’s 
“ First Book.” 
Grave VI. 
Study, in detail, oyster, clam, snail. Outline classes of the 
animal kingdom, using familiar types. Lead from observation 
of familiar animals to reading of others related to those studied. 
Distribution of animals. 
In all work, lead to accurate observation, clear and definite 
thought and expression, a reverent spirit, and knowledge of 
essential facts and principles.

IV. LESSONS ON THE HUMAN BODY. 
TEMPERANCE LESSONS. 
So much has been written and spoken of late in regard 
to teaching physiology and hygiene in the schoolroom 
that it would seem idle to add any words to the list. Yet 
there are many schoolrooms where the work is not un- 
derstood, and where the lessons prove failures because 
the teachers do not know the scope of the work, and 
the methods that should be employed. Probably there 
are few schools where the State law is not carried out to 
the letter. Doubtless there are very many schools 
where the law fails because it is fulfilled in letter only; 
still more, where well-meaning but ill-guided teachers 
waste time and opportunity in talking about alcohol and 
hygiene without adding a whit to either the knowledge 
or power of the pupils who listen to them, and perhaps 
repeat their words. The power to talk about bone, 
muscle, and sinew does not mean health; the knowledge 
that alcohol may destroy health does not always help to 
teach temperance. There must be more than that in 
our teaching. It is nowhere else more true than in 
these lessons that the spirit giveth life, the letter killeth. 
Why are these lessons taught in our schools? What 
should be our purpose in giving them? Toward what 
end should every lesson tend? 
“Why, we call them temperance lessons,” a young 
teacher replies; “and they teach the children temper: 
ance.”
-P-A-G-E-107
  LESSONS ON THE HUMAN BODY. 107 
  
“That means?” 
“Tt means abstaining from the use of alcohol and 
tobacco.” i 
Our young friend is not alone in her thinking, or 
rather, in her not thinking. Too many, if called upon 
to answer the question, might render an honest opinion 
after the same fashion. And because their ideas are so 
. vague and their vision so narrow, their teaching must 
fail to accomplish the desired results. 
Because the evils arising from the use of alcohol and 
tobacco are so great, the friends of temperance have 
endeavored to provide such instruction for the young 
as shall keep them from intemperate habits. Their 
hope must have been that children would turn from the 
temptation if they were shown the dire results that must 
follow the formation of such habits. But experience 
with human nature shows that one may have full knowl- 
edge of the probable results of a wrong course, and yet 
choose it deliberately, or slide into it through weakness, 
or be led into it through cowardice. A boy skates as 
near as he dares venture to the thin ice about an air- 
hole, not because he does not know that the ice is thin, 
the water cold, and the danger of drowning imminent; 
but because in the face of the knowledge he delights to 
take his chance of escape, and to enjoy the excitement 
of the experiment. How natural it is for us all, in 
watching another’s course, to feel that we, in his place, 
could have avoided the quicksands and escaped the 
storms ! 
This knowledge of danger is not enough to prevent 
the formation of evil habits. The most it can do is to 
aid the judgment. But the boy must love the right, 
must hate the wrong, must have a constant purpose to 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  108 NATURE STUDY. 
choose the right, even when the wrong seems pleasanter 
to his taste, and the strong will that is firm in trial, or 
his knowledge will not avail. The feelings must be cul- 
tivated, the will trained, the moral sense developed, to 
make the knowledge of use. 
What should we aim to accomplish through these 
lessons, then? What do we mean by a temperance 
lesson? 
If temperance implies self-control, obedience to law, 
right feeling, and clear knowledge, then any lesson 
which helps toward these results is so far a temperance 
lesson; and our temperance teaching is incomplete if 
we have omitted the means through which any or all of 
these results are reached. If knowledge is unaided by 
feeling, and the will is weak, the good fruits of the 
teaching will be few. 
We should add to the list of temperance lessons such 
exercises as will develop self-control and teach obedi- 
ence. It is easy to see that these need not be tabulated, 
nor given a place on the programme. Any exercise in 
which the pupils implicitly obey the teacher’s command, 
even when it opposes their heart’s desire, bears fruit in 
temperance, — is a temperance lesson. The bell rings 
as John Brown is making a “ home run” in that game 
so dear to the hearts of American youth. If he turns 
his course at once toward the schoolroom, instead of 
waiting to touch the base, is he not strengthening a 
quality which may keep him from intemperance? John 
Jones waits for “another strike” after the bell. Which 
of the two, other things being equal, would stand firmer 
when tempted to smoke or to drink? 
The teacher distributes colored crayons for the little 
ones to use, and tells the children not to lift them from
-P-A-G-E-109
  
LESSONS ON THE HUMAN BODY. 109 
the desk until her word is spoken. The impatient little 
hands are folded until the restriction is removed, al- 
though the eyes look longingly at the new treasures. 
Is not the lesson taught as truly a temperance lesson as 
the one in which the children learn the number of bones 
in the human body? Need we feel that temperance 
teaching is omitted when such habits are developed? 
In true temperance lessons the moral element bears 
an important part. The effect of alcohol upon nerve 
and muscle may be clearly shown, and abstinence be 
advised as a matter of expediency (however named), 
health being the reward of the denial and disease the 
penalty of the indulgence. Or thesame lesson may be 
taught in such spirit that the children will recognize 
some of the sacred responsibility that rests upon them 
to keep their bodies pure and strong; will feel that 
they have no right to make themselves weak and help- 
less when they should be strong and helpful; will look 
with reverence upon the wonderful houses given them, 
and know that it is their privilege to keep them fit to 
be the “temples of God.” There is no doubt that the 
second lesson is of greater worth than the first — is the 
true lesson we would teach. But only through the right 
spirit in the teacher can such lessons be given. Only 
_as she appreciates the sacredness of the lesson can the 
children learn strength and purity and nobility from her 
teaching. 
And here it may not be out of place to say that these 
lessons should not consist entirely of warnings against 
evil. Why not show the blessings that accompany right 
doing, as well as the penalties consequent upon wrong 
action? Why emphasize the bad instead of the good? 
Purity of thought and life are not best taught by dwell-
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 NATURE STUDY. 
  
ing upon impurity. Why incite to strength by empha- 
sizing weakness? It seems pitiful to open the eyes of 
children prematurely to the effects of evils they had 
never imagined, when the time might be spent in in- 
creasing their love for the good, which must help to 
keep them from evil. 
Again, such lessons, to inspire the children as they 
should, need to be given at fitting seasons, rather than 
by rote. Nothing is more distasteful to a child than 
prating. Too early he begins to look for words which 
are uttered for effect, and not because the truth begs to 
be spoken. A ready-made lesson on moral subjects is 
known as such by the children. The word has to be 
spoken “in season” to bear fruit. 
The newspaper reports an accident where many lives 
are lost through the negligence of a drunken switch- 
tender. There is an opportunity to impress the evil 
effects of drinking. Why should engineers be temper- 
ate mep? Why should pilots? Why should we? At 
such a time the questions mean much, and a word will 
accomplish more than a sermon spoken when the time 
was not ripe. 
Do not omit the lessons, then, but rather teach tem- 
perance with might and main. Let the lesson be such 
as will give clear, definite knowledge, —-will lead to 
truer tonceptions of right and wrong, greater love for 
purity and goodness, nobler purposes to direct, and 
stronger will to overcome. Fulfil the letter of the law, 
and give it life through the wise method and earnest 
spirit of your teaching.

  REPORT OF LESSON ON THE HUMAN BODY, GIVEN 
TO FIRST-YEAR PUPILS. 
Miss Hope has been asked to repeat for us all a lesson 
that she taught last month in her class work. So to- 
night we assemble in her schoolroom, instead of in the 
office, and watch her as she gathers her little class 
about her. 
“T have liked Miss Hope’s lessons on the human 
body,” Miss Oldways is saying; “she has struck the 
keynote, I think.” Miss Makepeace smiles a glad reply 
to her words: she is happy in her friend’s praise. Miss 
Oldways meant to reassure “Little Hope,” who evi- 
dently shrinks a little from the ordeal before her; and 
perhaps she meant to set us listening for the keynote. 
The young teacher reads only interest and good-will 
in our faces. She knows we are her friends, and 
straightway she forgets us in the lesson. 
“You may show me your right hand, Jennie. Your 
left hand, Mark. Your right arm, Kate. Your left 
arms, class. George, point to your left elbow. Susie, 
point to your right elbow. Harry, you may bend your 
right wrist. Mark may bend his left wrist. You all 
may move the fingers of your right hands. Show me 
the palms of your left hands. Rap on your desks with 
your knuckles. Show me your index fingers; ring 
fingers; little fingers; middle fingers; thumbs.” 
The children point quickly to the parts named. The 
questions come so fast that their attention is fixed, and 
they show eager interest. 
“You may show me how you can bend your fingers;
-P-A-G-E-112
112 NATURE STUDY. 
  your wrists; your arms. Show me how you can move 
your separate fingers; your thumbs. Will somebody 
tell me what we call these bending-places?” 
Mark answers readily, “We call them joints;” and 
adds further, “ Here is a joint at my elbow that lets me 
bend my arm forward and back.” 
Miss Hope smiles her appreciation of the knowledge 
he has treasured, and calls upon other pupils to name 
other joints. Alice bends her wrist for the class to watch 
its movement. Susie twists her forearm, and George 
swings his arm to show the freedom which the shoulder 
joints allow. 
“Let us see what we can make our hands and arms 
do,” Miss Hope says to the eager class. They stand at 
her signal, and follow her through a series of graceful 
movements. The arms are stretched, relaxed, lifted, 
dropped, waved, swung, in rhythmic motion. All the 
joints are used, all the muscles called into exercise. 
The little people play upon the piano, they throw snow- 
balls, they lift heavy stones, they cradle the sleeping 
baby, they gather flowers, they sow wheat, they saw 
wood, they pick up chips, —all with a keen zest and 
eager entering upon the play proposed. 
“While we rest,” Miss Hope continues, “ Alice may 
tell us of what use her hands and arms are to her.” 
“They help me to eat my dinner, to carry my books 
to school, and to button my cloak,” enumerates Alice, 
looking back over her day’s experience. ‘They help 
me to draw my sled up-hill, and to fasten on my skates,” 
Mark adds. Jennie wants to say that her hands help to 
make music when she practises her lesson; and Kate 
tolunteers that without her hands and arms she could 
aot play ball. After nearly all the class have mentioned

  some work of their hands, Miss Hope turns the direction 
of their thought by a gentle question: — 
“Can our hands be of use to any one else, as well as 
to us?” 
Little Jack cries eagerly, ‘“ My arms are of use to my 
father when I saw wood. I carry the wood in for my 
mother, too;” and the little lad straightens himself to 
look as tall as possible, in his consciousness of his power 
to serve. 
“I am glad to think you can do that, Jack.” Miss 
Hope speaks approvingly ; and Jack’s face wears a glad 
smile. 
“T can rock the baby when mother is tired,” Alice 
ventures timidly. ‘I get a pail of water every morning 
before I come to school,” Mark declares, as if he finds 
difficulty in remembering any help he has given. “I 
set the table every morning,” Jennie adds, and continues 
thoughtfully, “I might do more if I tried, I think.” 
“Tam very glad to hear all this about our hands,” 
Miss Hope is saying. “I think I should like to hear 
the words we learned about beautiful hands.” 
The little hands are folded, and the child-voices repeat 
together, — 
“ Beautiful hands are those that do 
Work that is earnest and brave and true, 
Moment by moment, the long day through.” 
“ And the other words we like,” suggests Miss Hope. 
“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy 
might,” chime the earnest voices. 
“Who will tell me how we should care for our 
Yands?” 
There are many volunteers. Hope chooses little

Jack, whose eagerness has already brought him to 
his feet. | 
“We must wash them clean with soap and water, — | 
lots of water, — just as often as they get black at all. 
And warm water is the best, if they are very black.” 
“T know how you can keep them soft,” Grace says, 
speaking for the first time. ‘“ You have to rub them 
with glycerine.” “I remember about the nails, too,” 
adds Jennie. ‘You told us how to take care of them, 
Miss Hope.” 
“You told us something else, Miss Hope.” ’Tis 
Mark’s voice this time. ‘‘ You told us about the ‘clean 
hands and a pure heart,’ for you said it wasn’t enough 
to be clean outside.” 
“What kind of hands do we want to have?” “Clean 
hands,” the children answer. 
“Can you think of any hands that we love very 
much; better than any other hands in the world?” 
Alice is ready to answer. “I love my papa’s hands. 
They are so strong. He lifts me way up into the air 
when he plays with me, when he comes home from 
work.” 
“What has made his arms so strong, Alice?” 
“He says ’t is working for us.” 
“That’s like the blacksmith, don’t you know,” Mark 
offers, eagerly. “ ‘And the muscles of his brawny arms 
are strong as iron bands.’ That’s because he ‘swings 
his heavy sledge.’” 
“Then what shall we do to make our hands strong?” 
asks the teacher. 
“We must work,” chime the voices again in chorus. 
“And are there no other hands that we love?” 
pursues Miss Hope.

“My mother’s hands,” little Kate makes answer. 
“She strokes my hair with her hands, and it’ feels 
good.” : 
Then follows an eager recital of the loving work of 
the mother-hands, ending with the decision that they 
are gentle because they are loving. 
“ Now we will think once again what we would choose 
for our hands,” Miss Hope says, bringing the little 
wanderers back from their excursion. 
“Clean, and strong, and gentle,” Jack sums them up. 
“What must we do to make them strong?” 
“We must work.” 
“ And to make them gentle?” 
“We must be loving.” 
“Then when we go home let us look for some loving 
work for our hands to do,” the young teacher says, as 
she dismisses the class, and smiles her good-night.

LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
I. PURPOSE AND PLAN. 
HE language lesson has its place in every school 
programme of to-day. We have come to recog- 
nize the importance of teaching the child how to use his 
mother tongue, and through these language lessons are 
attempting to give him the power. But the lessons 
would be much more effectual if their aim was clearly 
apprehended, and the methods were adapted to this 
aim. 
The very definition gives us the keynote of our lan- 
guage lessons, and furnishes us with the principle which 
should guide our work. “Language is any means of 
communicating ideas,” says Webster. In the old gram- 
mars we read, “A word is the sign of an idea, and is 
either spoken or written.” In the same pages we learn 
that a sentence is “the expression of a thought in 
words.” All the definitions point to the same truth. 
A word exists only that it may embody an idea; a sen- 
tence only that it may express a thought. Language is 
simply the expression of thought. When words cease 
to signify ideas, and sentences to express thought, they 
are no part of language or language lessons. 
The aim in language lessons should be simply the 
expression of thought. But the child must have the 
thought before he can express it. Lessons for thought-
-P-A-G-E-120
    120 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
getting, for the development of new ideas, must precede 
all forms of expression; otherwise the lessons will be 
simply word work, and the product of the lessons will 
be only words. 
There must be in the primary course lessons whose 
object shall be to lead the child to new ideas, which he 
may make his own, incorporating into his language the 
words which express these ideas. These lessons, in 
which the child gains new ideas, or clearer conceptions 
of ideas which were dim before, may be geography, 
history, reading, or the science lessons. Nothing new 
can be taught to the child, no new idea can be given 
him to express, without increasing his language power; 
for he grows in power of expression as he has more 
thoughts which seek expression. Hence these lessons 
are the foundation language lessons, without which the 
drill upon expression Zer se is useless. 
The various lessons for thought-getting will be out- 
lined under the different subjects. In this chapter the 
lessons in expression or form-getting will be emphasized. 
The form of expression is determined largely by habit, 
and the habit is in turn determined at first by the ideal 
placed before the child. The boy says, “I ain’t got no 
pencil,” because this pattern has been set for him at 
home, and constant repetition has made it habitual. 
The right form is fixed in the same way in the language 
of the child of more favorable surroundings. This child 
says, “I have no pencil,” with as much ease as the other 
displayed in his incorrect expression. The correct form 
of expression, whether it be pronunciation, inflection, or 
construction, is fixed by presenting the right ideal, and 
then occasioning the frequent repetition of the form to 
be learned. In no other way can the habit of correct
-P-A-G-E-121
    
PURPOSE AND PLAN. m20 
  
expression be formed. If the teacher is to present to 
the child the ideal of expression, it is essential that her 
own language should illustrate the qualities which she 
would teach. If her own association tends to fix in her 
speech incorrect forms of expression, she should make 
every effort to remedy the fault, and to accustom herself 
to the choicest language through reading the best books. 
Aim to present to your pupils the best example of 
English undefiled. Refrain from current expressions 
which attract because of their suggestiveness or absurd- 
ity, but which lower your standard of speech. The 
ideal which you present to your pupils should be the 
highest, not in the language lesson alone, but always. 
No knowledge of rules will take the place of the con- 
stant practice in the use of good English. The power 
to speak correctly comes through use, as we have said, 
and not through memorizing rules of speech. This is 
constantly proven in the experience of our acquaint- 
ances. I have heard a girl, who could analyze and 
parse “ Paradise Lost” to the entire satisfaction of her 
teacher, affirm that she did not like “them kind of 
sentences.” Her language was not modified by memo- 
rizing rules. Her form of expression had been fixed 
in earlier years. Omit the rules from the primary work, 
and give instead example and practice, over and over 
again. 
This practice may be given in connection with all 
lessons whenever an error is observed, but this is not 
enough. To offset the constant practice in wrong usage 
at home, there should be definite periods when the chil- 
dren give their attention to the correction of their habit- 
ual errors. Observe the language of the pupils, and 
make notes of habitual errors. For a week or a month 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
122 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  note all the incorrect expressions used by your pupils, 
and you will discover that they fall under a very few 
heads, if you attempt to classify them. The plural 
forms of nouns, the agreement of noun and verb, the 
case-forms of pronouns, and the tense-forms of irregular 
verbs will comprise them all. You will discover, more- 
over, that certain nouns, pronouns, and verbs are the 
staple stumbling-blocks. Set apart certain language 
periods for drill in these forms. Illustrations will be 
given later. Do not omit these lessons, but do not 
consider them the only class of language lessons to be 
given. 
Another quality of expression to be desired is fluency. 
Ease of expression can only be gained by practice. The 
chief element is the desire to express thought. If the 
child has something to say, he will not be hindered 
nor hampered; say it he must and can. This is the 
great value of the thought-getting lessons as language 
lessons. They give the child thoughts which he de- 
sires to express; and the very desire gives fluency in 
expression. The frequent practice gives ease, because 
expression becomes familiar, and so “easy.” We com- 
monly express this same truth when we say that a thing 
is easy for us because we are used to it. Custom, use, 
practice, give ease. Ease in expression must come 
through repeated expression, — the opportunity of the 
language period. 
It is not enough for language to be correct and fluent. 
It should be well chosen, the best expression of thought, 
and we may say, of the best thought. We cannot be 
satisfied to omit the esthetic element from our work. 
Taste is cultivated, just as accuracy is taught, by famil- 
iarizing the pupil with the ideal. The ideal of expres-
-P-A-G-E-123
  WRITTEN WORK. 123 
sion is found in the best literature. Happy the teacher 
who loves the best, and who presents that ideal to her 
pupils. 
II. WRITTEN WORK. 
All expression of thought in words is language. 
In ordinary life oral language predominates over the 
written. So it should be in the language period. The 
oral expression should precede and prepare the way 
for written work. The child is hindered by attempting 
to write before he learns to talk; for writing involves 
all the difficulties of oral expression, with the added 
burden of spelling, punctuation, and manipulation of 
pen, ink, and paper. Freedom, ease, and accuracy 
of oral expression should be gained in large measure 
before the writing is attempted, and the steps in written 
work should be carefully graded. Many teachers make 
the mistake of asking their pupils to write, in the half 
hour of study, what could not be accomplished in a 
half-day by themselves. The result is what might be 
expected. Failure begets indifference, and the work is 
either not attempted, or it is most carelessly done. Fit 
the lesson to the capacity of the pupil. Make it so . 
easy that he can accomplish it, and so hard that its 
accomplishment requires effort. Then see that it is 
done, and that the power to do grows with the constant 
practice which the lessons afford. 
The purpose of the work in written language should 
be, as in oral language, to express thought. This pur- 
pose should never be lost sight of in the attempt to 
teach the necessary forms. It is easy to let this written 
work degenerate into writing declarative or interrogative
-P-A-G-E-124
124 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
sentences, and lists of words having a certain plural 
form, with kindred exercises whose only object is to 
fix certain mechanical forms and usages. These forms 
must be learned by the child, but they should not 
appear to him the only end to be attained in his work. 
The expression of thought is the great purpose, and 
these forms are simply means leading toward clear and 
correct expression. 
The teacher should remember, in all written work, 
that these forms and customs are arbitrary. They can- 
not be discovered through reason on the part of the 
child. The one and only way in which they can be 
taught is to show the pattern or ideal to the child, and 
then to lead him to observe how and where this pattern 
is used in expressions with which he is familiar. After 
the use of the form has been clearly discerned by the 
child, the next step is to fix this form in his mind 
through continued practice until it becomes a part of 
his habitual expression. First, aid him to see the ideal 
clearly; second, give him opportunity to imitate it in 
his practice. 
The work becomes very simple as soon as the teacher 
has recognized the directness of the method, and has 
looked over the work to be done, in order to determine 
the order, or the steps, and the number of facts to be 
taught. These are, in reality, very few. We can almost 
count upon our fingers the rules for written expression 
that must be followed in ordinary practice. Our labor 
is confined to these few lines: the use of the marks of 
punctuation, the use of capitals, and the division of the 
subject into paragraphs, with the forms which are 
accepted in letter-writing. 
The marks of punctuation present themselves in the
-P-A-G-E-125
  
WRITTEN WORK. 125 
  first written work which the child attempts. The first 
thought that he writes is expressed in a sentence, and 
the sentence, to be correctly written, should close with 
a period. From the day when sentence writing begins, 
the teacher should insist upon the use of the period at 
the close of every statement. She need not give the 
rule to the child in stated words, but she should call 
his attention to the period in her sentence which he 
copies, and should tell him that his own will be 
incomplete without it. If she continually demands 
the presence of this mark in all his written sentences, 
the use will become habitual, and the child will not 
need to be told in later years that this is a necessary 
part of his sentence. 
During the first year of school the use of the inter- 
rogation point can be taught in the same way. Just 
as soon as the child is able to distinguish a question 
and its answer, he is able to place the interrogation 
point after his sentence. If this practice is insisted 
upon from the beginning, this point, too, will be easily 
taught, and the language lessons of every day will 
afford abundant opportunity for practice, through which 
the habit becomes fixed. 
The use of the comma after direct address, and after 
words in a series, should follow in the second year. By 
this time the child will find in his reading books ample 
illustration of this use of the comma, and by careful 
questioning may be led to see under what circumstances 
this mark of punctuation is used. Holding fast to the 
habits already gained in the use of the period and 
interrogation point, the teacher will add to these, in 
the same way, this power to use the comma in its 
right place.  
-P-A-G-E-126
126 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
The next mark of punctuation, in natural order, is 
the apostrophe. In children’s work this will appear 
first in contractions, and its use should be taught in 
connection with the spelling lesson. It will be easy 
to show that the apostrophe in “I’H” takes the place 
of the “wi,” that the apostrophe in “can’t” takes the 
place of “no.” This the child will see for himself, if 
the teacher questions thoughtfully; and after he has 
grasped the new idea he should have repeated drill in 
finding words in which the apostrophe is so used, and 
showing what letters have been omitted in the contrac- 
tion. This work may easily be done in the first half 
of the second year of school. In the second year the 
use of the apostrophe in possessives should be taught. 
The teaching of this point involves more skill and 
care on the part of the teacher than does the previous 
work, because it demands more thought and knowledge 
on the part of the child. He must learn to distinguish 
the name of the owner, to select words which denote 
ownership, and learn the place of the apostrophe. 
Because the practice differs, or seems to differ, in the 
singular and plural, it is better to take one step at a 
time, and introduce the children to the singular posses- 
sive without attempting the plural. This use should 
be firmly fixed by constant and varied practice before 
exceptions are brought into the lessons. 
The points remaining to be emphasized in punctua- 
tion, are the semicolon, dash, exclamation point, and 
quotation marks. It is doubtful whether children in 
the primary grades will become so proficient in writing 
as to need the semicolon to make their sentences clear. 
The use of the dash is so varied and indefinite that this, 
too, may be postponed to the time when grammatical
-P-A-G-E-127
  
WRITTEN WORK. 127 
  
construction has been taught. The use of the exclama- 
tion point is easily impressed, but it should be timited 
in the early work to exclamations which demand the 
mark of astonishment. It is often used where the 
comma can well take its place. 
For the third year of school we have left, then, simply 
the use of quotation marks to add to practice upon 
the points already learned. The manner in which these 
should be taught will be indicated in a lesson follow- 
ing this chapter. The order of work here, as with 
the apostrophe, should be carefully determined by the 
teacher. The points which she wishes the child to see 
should be carefully, clearly stated by herself as well as 
by the children. They should be led to discover the 
use of this mark of punctuation in their readers, and 
should have frequent drill in its use when writing. 
Dialogues afford a good opportunity for this practice, 
or stories into which some conversation enters. Care 
should be taken, however, to postpone the broken quo- 
tation until the pupil has gained facility in the use of 
the unbroken quotation. 
The use of capitals is the second division of the 
written forms to be mastered by the pupil. The order 
of progress is like that outlined for the marks of punc- 
tuation. Many of the rules over which careful pupils 
have labored, and which they have attempted to apply 
in their compositions, after having broken them over 
and over again in their earlier writing, and so having 
fixed the habit of incorrect usage,—many of these 
forms may be easily taught by impressing the right 
pattern upon the mind of the child in the earlier 
lessons. Just as he learned to use the period at the 
close of every statement which he copied, so should
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
he accustom himself to the use of the capital letter 
at the beginning of every sentence. No sentence which 
is copied, written from dictation, or used in original 
work, should be accepted by the teacher unless it begins 
with a capital. If she persistently adheres to this plan 
of action, the first year in the school will fix the habit 
with the ordinary child, and nothing more need be said 
about it afterward. If this work has been omitted in 
the beginning, the same steps must be taken in later 
years; but they will be taken of necessity with greater 
labor and pains, because the wrong habit has become 
fixed in the interim. 
The second step will be fixing the use of the capital 
in proper names. This does not involve teaching the 
pupil that a proper noun is the name of a person, place, 
or thing. It is enough to tell him, in the first sentence 
in which such nouns are used, that Harry’s name should 
begin with a capital, or John’s, or Kate’s, or Mary’s, as 
the case may be, and after repeated illustration he 
readily derives the fact, which is true to custom, that 
all names of people are written with a capital letter. 
The use of the capital in names of places will be taught 
in the same way, as occasion requires in the ordinary 
expression of the child. | 
Perhaps the most difficult point to be taught will be 
the use of the capital in direct quotations. This point 
should be met when the use of the quotation marks is 
fixed. 
Third upon our list of written forms is the paragraph. 
Division of a subject into paragraphs depends entirely 
upon the division of the thought, and upon this alone. 
It should be taught whenever composition is taught, 
beginning with the earliest exercises in description and
-P-A-G-E-129
  
WRITTEN WORK. 129 
  narration. If the child has become accustomed in oral 
description to separate what he has to say into natural 
parts, arranged in the natural order, it will be an easy 
matter in the written expression to teach him to indent 
the beginning of each part; but it often happens that 
the teacher thinks of the paragraphs only when she 
comes to written expression, without having realized 
that the habit of systematic arrangement is that upon 
which this item of form will depend. When the child 
describes the plant as a whole, and then in its parts, a 
description of the whole would naturally make one 
paragraph, and description of parts another; or, if the 
description is full and complete, a paragraph may be 
given to each part. The systematic arrangement of 
the topics which determine the description will also 
determine the grouping of the thoughts which enter 
into the paragraphs. It is well for the teacher in the 
earlier writing to indicate an outline of topics which the 
child is to follow, impressing upon him that each one 
is to serve as the foundation for a paragraph; and she 
herself should remember that the paragraph exists 
simply to show these divisions which come through the 
regular arrangement of thought. She should emphasize 
this arrangement, and lead the child to criticise his own 
expression until he learns to see the relation of his 
thoughts, and the groups in which the sentences belong, 
Lastly we come to the letter forms, which can be 
fixed only by presenting and emphasizing the facts 
which usage has sanctioned, and then affording occasion 
for repeated and varied practice. Because most people 
make use of their knowledge of written forms merely 
in letter-writing, having no other opportunity of express- 
ing their thoughts in writing, this common form of 
9
-P-A-G-E-130
    
130 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  expression should be emphasized in every schoolroom; 
and because many children leave school before entering 
even the grammar grades, it is well that this practice 
should begin in the primary school. 
There are three distinct steps in mastering the letter 
form. First, the child should see, attentively observe, 
and describe, the place appropriated to’ each part, — 
the heading, superscription, and address. Second, he 
should copy carefully the examples placed before him. 
After this step, and third, he should apply this knowl- 
edge by placing his own compositions in letter form. 
Simple descriptions of plant or animal or mineral, the 
story told in the morning or read in the reading-lesson, 
may be reproduced day after day in letter form. Notes 
to parents, schoolmates, or teachers, may be copied and 
dictated for the spelling lessons. The ingenious teacher 
will find manifold opportunities for making the child 
familiar with these forms in his every-day language 
lesson. They cannot be too early fixed in his mind. 
The simplest and most direct forms should be used, — 
those which are in current use, and which the child will 
have frequent occasion to use for himself in his daily 
life. Other forms may safely be left to the period when 
rhetoric comes to his aid. 
The test of the pupil’s power to write in accordance 
with usage is best made through the dictation exercise. 
The use of the dictation exercise has been outlined in 
connection with the spelling lesson. The same plan 
should be observed in the language lesson. 
It will readily be seen that all the work thus far out- 
lined, in teaching the child to use the forms which 
custom has made necessary in writing, may be given in 
connection with language work, necessitated in the ex:

LESSONS FROM PICTURES. 131 
  
pression of the child’s thought. The use of the capital, 
period, interrogation point, and quotation mark is to 
be fixed through the necessary repetition of the sen- 
tences which express the author's own thought, the 
reproduction of a story, the discussion of the day’s work, 
the paraphrase of the memory gem, or the outcome of 
the science lesson. As in oral lessons, thought is first, 
expression second ; and forms of expression are taught 
that they may fittingly embody thought. 
The habits which are fixed with the written language 
work are as important as the knowledge gained, and 
they are taught in the same way. Every habit is fixed 
by thoughtful repetition. The habits of neatness, order 
of arrangement, accuracy, should be daily becoming 
stronger. If no careless work is received, if no untidy 
work is allowed, if the proper order is insisted upon day 
after day, week after week, month after month, the cor- 
rect habits of work will be fixed; but the price that must 
be paid is thoughtful and patient persistence and un- 
swerving adherence to the ideal which the teacher has 
placed before the child. Such results cannot be ob- 
tained in a day, nor a week, nor a month. They require 
the line upon line, and precept upon precept, and the 
faithful insistence every day upon the best results that 
the pupils can attain. Only des? will insure better. 
III. LESSONS FROM PICTURES. 
The lessons from pictures are among the most helpful 
language lessons if they are properly taught. Unless 
the teacher has in mind a definite purpose, and definite 
means to achieve that purpose, the language lesson 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    132 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  becomes a mere talking exercise, aimless, vague, and 
profitless. Many lessons which are reported as being 
very enthusiastic and interesting belong to this class. 
The child is in no wise profited by the lesson, beyond 
the fact that he is interested during the period. If the 
teacher carefully chooses her subject, questions defi- 
nitely, holds in mind the knowledge which the child 
should gain or the power which she would develop, the 
lesson becomes a help in language training. The pic- 
ture serves to develop a subject, which suggests new 
thoughts to the pupil, and affords opportunity for the 
expression of the knowledge gained. 
The purpose of a lesson from a picture should be 
to lead the child to observe, to think, and to express 
his thought. The lesson which results in observation, 
thought, and expression has the elements of a good 
lesson. 
Observation should be accurate, —the child should 
tell just what he sees, not what he thinks he sees. It 
should be thoughtful, —he should come to recognize 
the meaning of what he sees. It should be well ar- 
ranged, —centred about some chief object in the pic- 
ture. It should be complete, — including all that may 
be seen in the picture. The expression of the child’s 
thought should be accurate, — that is, truthful; it should 
be complete, not fragmentary. It should be well ar- 
ranged. The teacher should so question the child and 
so direct his observation as to secure these ends. 
The simplest picture lessons are those in which the 
child simply describes what he sees in the picture. 
This description should not be fragmentary. The child 
will tend to see isolated objects, and merely to state the 
fact that he sees these objects. “I see a boy.” “I see 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
  LESSONS FROM PICTURES. 133 
    
a horse.” ‘TI see a watering-trough.” He has seen the 
picture as a collection of objects, not as one group which 
expresses a single thought. Lead him to see every 
object in the picture in its relation to a central figure. 
“T see a boy and a horse standing by a watering-trough. 
The horse is drinking from the trough, and the boy holds 
his halter that he may not get away. Not far off is the 
barn. The door is open, and I can see the stalls within. 
There are other horses in the barn, and I think the 
boy will lead this horse back and bring the others out to 
drink.” Through such an exercise the child learns to 
see relations and to express them in separate sentences. 
The teacher should see that the child does the talking, 
that his answers are complete and well arranged. To 
this end, she should give the children an opportunity to 
repeat the entire description, first, in answer to questions 
in some definite order, and second, without any such 
help. In this way the child becomes independent and 
accustomed to complete expression. When he answers 
the isolated questions merely, the teacher often helps 
by look, inflection, or suggestion, and the child does 
little independent work. For older pupils the descrip< 
tion may be written, the order being suggested by topics 
or questions upon the board. The habit of complete 
expression and a right arrangement is one of the most 
important results of such lessons. 
The second way in which a picture may be used is as 
the basis of an imaginary story. The order of the work 
in such lessons is, first, observation; second, thought; 
third, imagination; and fourth, narration. In order to 
make the work definite and helpful, the teacher should 
carefully hold the children to certain subjects for dis- 
cussion, They will tend to ramble as they travel through
-P-A-G-E-134
    134 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  the fields of imagination, and often will lead far from 
the subject originally suggested. She should keep in 
mind the frame for the lessons. In the picture which we 
have just described, for example, she may decide upon 
the one central figure, the boy, and determine to lead 
the children to imagine, first, his work; and from that 
his previous history. Her questions may be something 
like the following. After the children have seen and 
described what is in the picture, she says, “ Let us name 
this boy.” “We will call him Joe.” ‘Let us imagine 
where he has lived, and what kind of life he has had. 
Where is he now? In the city or in the country? In 
the village or upon a farm? Who owns the farm? Is 
Joe Mr. Smith’s son?” Some one suggests that Joe 
used to be a poor boy living in the city, and that Mr. 
Smith has taken him to help him on the farm. “How 
did Mr. Smith happen to be in the city?” “He went 
there to sell vegetables in the market.” “What was 
Joe doing?” “Joe was blacking boots and selling pa- 
pers in the street.” “How did Mr. Smith happen to 
see him?” “ Joe stood near the market, looked hungry ; 
Mr. Smith gave him an apple, talked with him, liked 
him, asked him to go home and help him. Joe was 
glad to leave the street for the farm. He works hard, 
and is glad to work, is trusted by Mr. Smith, goes to 
school in winters, is growing to be an-honest man.” 
If the pupils write this story or repeat it, they should 
be helped at first by topics or leading questions which 
will assist them in grouping their thoughts. The whole 
work of paragraph-making may be taught in this way. 
After the children have become accustomed to this kind 
of exercise, and have learned to write a complete story, 
they may be given different pictures and allowed to
-P-A-G-E-135
LESSONS FROM PICTURES. 135 
  
write individual stories without help. Much valuable 
training may come out of these exercises. 
The material for these lessons should be carefully 
selected. The picture should be large, that it may be 
easily seen by every pupil in the class. It should con- 
tain few objects, in order that the description may be 
centralized and complete. The picture is more pleasing 
to little children if colored. It may be made helpful 
in color lessons. The subject should be one in which 
the children would naturally be interested; not a land- 
scape or a village, but a scene which represents life and 
action, — child-life if possible. It should suggest good 
thoughts, and be artistically good as possible. We 
have no time nor effort to give to placing before the 
children anything less than the best. Pictures of news- 
boys lounging about the lamp-post, half sick from 
smoking their first cigar, might be interesting to the 
pupils, but they are not inspiring. Choose, rather, a 
picture of a St. Bernard dog, supplied with his life- 
saving outfit, finding the half-buried traveller in the 
snow;" or a picture of a little sunshine-maker tending 
the baby sister, that the tired mother may finish her 
work, 
The new ideas in geography or reading may often 
be best taught by means of pictures. By all means 
make a collection-to use in the schoolroom. 
These pictures need not be expensive. In fact, the 
best collection may involve an expenditure of time and 
effort merely. Excellent illustrations for the geog- 
raphy, or history, or general lesson, are found in our 
illustrated papers. Advertisements of the various rail- 
ways offer beautiful illustrations of natural scenery. 
Some of the advertising cards which are gratuitously
-P-A-G-E-136
  136 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
distributed by many firms may be made useful. These 
may be mounted upon stout manilla paper. Cut the 
paper in sheets of equal size, mount one card or picture 
only upon the sheet. Leave a wide margin. The 
picture stands out boldly from such a background, is 
more plainly seen by the pupils, and is more easily 
kept. A portfolio of pictures can be collected in a 
short time. They will be found helpful, again and 
again, in language lessons. 
Many questions arise as the teacher attempts to lead 
her children to the description or story in the picture 
lesson. “Would you have the children always answer 
in complete sentences?” The aim will be to develop 
in the children the power of complete expression, but 
that is not the only aim, and often is not the immediate 
aim in the lesson. If the teacher wishes to lead the 
child to think, and succeeds in arousing his interest in 
the picture before him, she will often find it wise to 
leave a fragmentary or incorrect statement uncorrected 
for the time being. If the attention of the child is 
centred upon the form of his expression, it is with- 
drawn from the object which he is observing. In order 
to have an interesting and complete description, she 
must hold the attention to the central object; therefore 
it is frequently best to accept sentences which would be 
unsatisfactory as final, but which cannot be corrected 
at the time without marring interest in the lesson. At 
a later period she may give lessons whose object will 
be to correct the expressions used in the description. 
In these exercises she can hold the pupil to complete 
and correct expression. 
“ How soon would you use such pictures?” is a ques- 
tion which is often asked. They are very helpful in
-P-A-G-E-137
LESSONS FROM PICTURES. 137 
  the primary grades. They suggest subjects for conver- 
sation in the early lessons, when the child is becoming 
acquainted with the teacher. All children are inter- 
ested in pictures. They love to look at them and ask 
about them; and the picture will prove a good starting- 
point for many of the early lessons in language or 
reading. They may often be used as the basis for the 
reading lessons. Their use should continue through the 
grammar grades, especially as a help in geography and 
general lessons, and as a foundation for written work. 
The teacher should observe herself most carefully as 
she gives these lessons. Her manner and questioning 
will do much to determine the value of the lesson, and 
questions should be clear, definite, and direct. They 
should necessitate thought on the part of the children, 
and not put the words into their mouths, relieving them 
from all need of thought. They should be well shaped, 
and should be answered just as asked. “What did 
Johnny do?” should not be answered by, “ He is going 
to the barn.” Only one form of the verb could be used 
in answer to that question. See that the child hears 
just what the teacher asks, and answers just what 
she asks. The habit of attention and obedience thus 
acquired is invaluable. 
Guard against repeating the answer of the child. 
The teacher often falls into that habit because she is 
not well prepared with her questions, and she uncon- 
sciously hopes to gain time. The habit may also come 
through the attempt to make all the class hear what 
one pupil has indistinctly said; but the pupils are thus 
relieved from all responsibility in making the others 
hear, and they will not speak clearly and distinctly unless 
they are required to do this work for themselves.
-P-A-G-E-138
  138 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
The tendency of the child will be to imitate the 
expression of those first called upon to recite. To 
prevent this, the teacher should distribute her questions 
carefully, varying them to suit the need of the children, 
and in accordance with the purpose of the lesson. If 
the aim is to help the children to right arrangement 
and complete expression, it will not matter that they 
all say and write the same thing. The object here is 
form-getting, and there is but one ideal of form. But if 
the teacher’s object is to develop power of individual 
expression, the children should work with separate 
pictures, or write without the teacher’s help. 
A profitable exercise for the teacher herself is the 
writing of a description or story which she would 
require from the pupils. If she watches her own work, 
and discovers the difficulties that are in her own way, 
she will work more patiently with the children, and will 
also recognize more clearly the ideal which she should 
place before them. 
IV. LESSONS ON WORD-FORM. 
We have now come to recognize in our teaching that 
knowing a thing is not equivalent to doing it, and that 
knowing does not always result in doing; so the day is 
past when the study of rules of grammar is depended 
upon for fixing correct habits of speech. The child’s 
forms of expression are fixed at home, — first, through 
the pattern which is set him by his father and mother 
and sisters and brothers, and second, by the constant 
repetition of this form. The habit of correct expres- 
sion must be fixed in the same way. The teacher must
-P-A-G-E-139
  LESSONS ON WORD-FORMS. 139 
  
set the pattern for the children, and then occasion the 
use of the correct form. The following exercises illus- 
trate the manner in which this can best be done. 
EXERCISES IN FIXING CORRECT FORMS. 
(To correct the use of two negatives, as, “I ain’t got 
mo pencil; ” “I didn’t have no time.” Exercises given 
to primary grades.) 
Teacher, — To-day I will play that I am borrowing. I 
will ask you to lend me something. Please lend me your 
knife. 
Pupil. —1 ain’t got no knife. 
“Johnny, please lend me your knife.” 
“T have n’t got no knife.” 
“ Katie, please lend me your knife.” 
“T have no knife.” 
“ Katie’s answer was right. I like the way in which she said 
it. Listen; I will ask her again. Katie, please lend me your 
knife. Johnny, please let me take your knife.” 
“T have no knife.” 
“ Please let me take your watch. Please let me take your 
umbrella.” 
“T have no umbrella.” 
“Please lend me your pen.” 
“T have no pen.” 
“ Will you give me an orange?” 
“T have no orange.” 
“Let Katie take your book.” 
“T have no book.” 
The continuation of this exercise makes it necessary 
that every child use the correct form. The teacher 
should emphasize the correct form rather than the
-P-A-G-E-140
140 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
incorrect, calling attention to the one who gives the 
right answer and not to the wrong one. 
(To fix the correct form of the pronoun used in the 
nominative case.) 
Teacher. — John and Peter may run across the room. John, 
tell me what you and Peter did. 
Answer. — Me and Peter run across the room. 
“ Peter, tell me what you and John did.” 
“T and John ran across the room.” 
“The polite way is to name John before you name yourself. 
Now tell me again.” 
“ John and I ran across the room.” 
“Now, John, Peter told me very nicely. Listen while he 
tells me again. Now you may answer the question, What did 
you and Peter do?” 
“ Peter and I ran across the room.” 
“ Kate, in what class are you?” 
“T am in the highest class.” 
“Tn what class is Mary?” 
“ Mary is in the highest class.” 
“ Katie, tell me in what class you and Mary are.” 
“ Mary and me are in the highest class.” 
“Do you remember how Peter told me who ran across the 
room? Peter, tell us again. Now, Kate, tell me who are in 
the highest class.” 
“ Mary and I are in the highest class.” 
“ Who lives on roth Street? John, Jack, Mary? Mary, you 
may tell me what three children live on roth Street.” 
“John, Jack, and I live on roth Street.” 
“Susie and Belle may take these pencils.” 
“Susie, what girls have my pencils? ” 
“ Belle and I have your pencils.” 
“Belle, what girls have my pencils?” 
“Susie and I have your pencils.”
-P-A-G-E-141
  LESSONS ON WORD-FORMS. I4I 
  This exercise will need to be repeated many times in 
the ordinary schoolroom, but the children never tire 
of the practice when varied as above suggested. The 
right form is emphasized, and the children are required 
to use it over and over again. This accomplishes much 
more than the repetition of arule. The use of the right 
form becomes habitual only through practice. Written 
exercises in filling blanks may be assigned after the 
right ideal of the form is fixed in the minds of the 
children. 
Irregular verb forms. 
The mistakes which occur in the use of irregular 
verbs are always to be found in the use of the past 
tense and the perfect participles. There is no need of 
drilling upon all of the several forms. Centre all the 
attention upon those where the difficulty is found. 
Exercise : ~ 
Teacher (writing upon the board). —Mary, what am I 
doing ? 
“You are writing upon the board.” 
“John, what did I do?” 
“You wrote upon the board.” 
“ Kate, what have I done?” 
“You have written upon the board.” 
“ Mary, tell Kate what I did upon the board.” 
“Miss A. wrote upon the board.” 
“Susie, tell Kate what I have done.” 
“ Miss A. has written upon the board.” 
“John, I will give you my chalk. What did I do?” 
“You gave me your chalk.” 
“Kate, what have I done?” 
“You have given your chalk to John.”
-P-A-G-E-142
142 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  “Susie, what did I do.” 
“You gave your chalk to John.” 
“See this piece of paper. What am I doing?” 
“You are tearing the paper.” 
“What did I do?” 
“You tore the paper.” 
“ What have I done?” 
“You have torn the paper.” 
“ Mary, tell Kate what I did.” 
“Miss A. tore the paper.” 
“ Kate, tell Susie what I have done.” 
“Miss A. has torn the paper.” 
“See the crayon. What am I doing?” 
“You are breaking the crayon.” 
“What did I do?” 
“ You broke the crayon.” 
“ What have I done?” 
“You have broken the crayon.” 
“Tell John what I have done.” 
“Miss A. has broken the crayon.” 
“Tell John what I did.” 
“Miss A. broke the crayon.” 
In the above exercises the teacher must insist upon 
close attention to the form of her question, and exact 
answers. After a few such lessons, the children will 
become accustomed to the correct form and will 
observe its use in the class, and then it will be possible 
to call the attention of the pupil, by word or sign, to 
his use of the incorrect form, and such a correction 
will not interrupt the current of the lesson. After 
these exercises have been given, the teacher may insist 
upon the correct use in all the exercises of the day. 
Frequently the pupils become critics, and report any 
departure from the new ideal that has been presented

to them. In selecting forms for drill, choose those 
that have been used incorrectly. Drill upon one until 
that form is fixed before attempting another. 
V. POEMS AND STORIES AS LANGUAGE 
LESSONS. 
The lessons which provide material for language les- 
sons, as far as thought-getting is concerned, are in two 
classes, — those in which the material is gained through 
observation on the part of the child, and others in which 
the child gets his needed thought through listening 
to the teacher’s story or through reading for himself. 
Among the many subjects which might well be chosen 
for the language lessons, the writer has come to select 
two chief sources, — science, and literature, including 
history. The work which the child does in observation 
is incomplete unless it is re-enforced and interpreted by 
the observation of others; and this re-enforcement must 
come through reading. Again, the observation helps 
the child to interpret what he reads, and makes the 
poem or story more clear than if he himself had not 
been open-eyed to his own surroundings. If the gen- 
eral lessons are chosen in these two lines, the lan- 
guage lessons will naturally be associated with them, 
and the work in each line will supplement that of the 
other. In considering the language lesson as such, we 
must remember that its purpose is both thought and 
expression. Through the study of the poem or story 
the child will obtain new material for expression. His 
horizon is widened by going beyond that which he
-P-A-G-E-144
144 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
himself has seen, by reaching out into the new fields 
which his observation has enabled him to discover. In 
thinking of the observation lesson isolated from such 
reading or study, we are reminded of Sam Weller’s reply 
to the inquiry as to whether he had seen a certain 
important event in which Mr. Pickwick was interested. 
His words were, “ Having only eyes, my wision is lim- 
ited.” The child’s vision is limited, if he has not been 
taught to see with the mind’s eye, to use his imagination, 
and to translate the new through his knowledge of the 
old; so the story, the poem, and the fable should be 
brought into the schoolroom, introduced into the lan- 
guage class as well as into the reading, and used to 
supplement and complete the science lessons. 
If the child is to gain thought which becomes his 
own, and is to express it afterward, this thought should 
be in every case worth the getting, something that 
will not only add to his knowledge, but which will 
accustom him to the beautiful in thought and expression, 
and so will inspire him to follow higher ideals. All the 
stories or poems selected for repetition in the school- 
room should be the best which the child is capable o: 
hearing and appreciating. We make a mistake when| 
we read down to the children, — when we imagine tha 
all truth must be diluted before they can hear it o 
attempt to assimilate it. The child is by nature a poet; 
he appreciates what is most beautiful in poetry; he wil 
prefer the poem to the jingle, will unconsciously selec 
that which is best; and the expressions which he canno’ 
understand remain with him in his memory, recurrin 
again and again as some association recalls them, unti 
his later experience enables him to interpret their mean 
ing, and they come with new fulness of truth or beauty ii
-P-A-G-E-145
POEMS AND STORIES. 145 
  
his time of need. But the period of his childhood is the 
period in which he should become familiar with beauty 
of thought and expression; not through analysis, —that 
time is not yet, — but through simple absorption of the 
ideas presented to him in the rhythmic poem or story. 
There is no other period when he takes so strong and 
eager hold upon such things. He absorbs now what he 
will interpret hereafter; and he should be made familiar 
with the good, in order that when he comes to the time 
of choice, with the power of reading to serve as a key 
to unlock the door of the treasure house, he shall know 
the gold from the dross, and will choose that which is 
of eternal worth. 
In his beautiful preface to “Child Life in Prose,” 
Whittier wrote, “The child is always something of a 
poet. If he cannot analyze with Wordsworth and Ten- 
nyson the emotions which expand his being, within his 
fulness of life blest above the birds and flowers, he finds 
with them all nature plastic to his mind and eye. Not 
irreverently has Jean Paul said, ‘I love God and little 
children; ye stand nearest to him, ye little ones.’ 
“very well remember how at an early age the sol- 
emn organ roll of Gray’s ‘Elegy’ and the lyric sweep 
of Cowper's ‘ Lament for the Royal George, moved and 
fascinated me with a sense of power felt rather than 
understood. ‘A spirit passed before my face, but the 
form thereof was not observed.’ Every day, with un- 
guessed meanings, these poems spoke to me, in an 
unknown tongue indeed, but like the wind in the pines 
or the waves on the beach, awakening faint echoes and 
responses, and vaguely prophesying of wonders yet to 
be revealed. 
“John Woolman tells us that when a small child he

read from that sacred prose poem, the book of Revela- 
tion, which has so perplexed critics and commentators, 
these words: ‘He showed me the river of the water of 
life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of 
God and of the Lamb;’ and that his mind was drawn 
thereby to seek after that wonderful purity; and the 
place where he sat and the sweetness of that child 
yearning remained still fresh in his memory in after life. 
The spirit of that mystical anthem which Milton speaks 
of as a ‘seven-fold chorus of hallelujahs and harping 
symphonies,’ hidden so often from wise and prudent stu- 
dents of the letter, was felt, if not comprehended, by 
the simple heart of a child.” 
The truth which Whittier has so emphasized has been 
illustrated over and again in our primary schoolrooms, 
We have seen children drinking in the story of “ Hia- 
watha” or Whittier’s “Snowbound,” or reciting with 
joyful voices Tennyson’s “ Song of the Brook,” or sing- 
ing still more sweetly his “Sweet and Low, Wind of the 
Western Sea.” We remember a class of first-grade 
pupils who could recite pages of “ Hiawatha,” and 
whose chief delight was to play it, taking the part of 
the pines and fir-trees and the animals in the forest, of 
Nokomis and Hiawatha, and even representing the wig- 
wam. Their eyes kindled as they recited the beautiful 
words, and their lives were beautified and made happier 
by the thoughts and pictures which had entered into 
them through their study of the poem. Children whose 
home life was narrowed and dwarfed, whose opportu- | 
nities were meagre, whose surroundings were rough and 
poor, entered into the spirit of the poem with the same 
eagerness as did the children of more favored homes.

Minneapolis learned nearly all of Whittier’s “ Snow- 
bound,” and begged to be allowed to continue their 
study when the time came for changing the course of 
the recitations. A class of little Scandinavian children, 
to whom had been read Longfellow’s beautiful poem, 
“My Lost Youth,” turned in troubled disappointment 
to the teacher as she closed her book at the third stanza, 
saying, “ That is all you can understand.” ‘Do read it 
to us even if we do not understand,” they pleaded, 
touched and held by the rhythm of the poem and the 
beauty of expression, which they felt even if they did not 
comprehend. How much better to read these poems 
to the children, to give them such food for their imagi- 
nation, to fill their lives with such pictures and such 
ideals, to bring them into fellowship with the good and 
the true and the beautiful, —how much better than to 
measure out to them page after page of words which 
express the diluted thoughts of the ordinary reader, or 
to tell them the stories gathered at random from the 
child’s story book or the teacher’s memory. re 
Out of such teaching should come greater power to 
imagine pure and beautiful pictures, the ideals of what 
is strong and noble and true, as history has shown us 
these virtues, and a love for the beautiful, —strong 
enough to lead the child away from the slough of trash 
which is waiting to swallow him up. 
The stories chosen for the language lesson should be 
fables or parables, teaching truth in the form which the 
children love so well, or anecdotes embodying the truth 
in heroic form. Much as children love the marvellous, 
and delight to hear the animal speak, or see the brave 
invariably winning renown and the beautiful invariably 
inheriting riches and bliss, they are still more entranced
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 LANGUAGE LESSONS. 
  
by the stories of real life, —the true stories for which 
they plead, and for whose repetition they constantly 
urge. 
The teacher will find numerous sources upon which 
she can draw for her stories, but she will find no one 
book or paper which will contain sufficient material 
suitable for her class, nor would it be best if she could. 
The story which will teach the child most is the one 
which she herself loves and appreciates, which she 
remembers because she has loved and appreciated it. 
The best poets should be read, the best books should 
be studied, myths and fables and traditions should yield 
their treasures, and history should pledge its heroes to 
the teachers of little children. All that is best in her 
life affects the life of the children; that which is most 
truly hers affects them most. No story which she reads 
from the book to her class will have the power or charm 
of the story that she tells because she has loved it — has 
sympathized with the truth which it expresses, or has 
been inspired by its ideal. 
Teachers should become good story-tellers, — should 
know how to present the point of a story, how to dress 
it and give it its fittest setting; they should come to the 
children with no barrier of book or paper between them 
and their class, but should give out the story from the 
reservoir of their own experience, warm.and glowing 
with the warmth of their own appreciation and enjoy- 
ment. Then the story will touch the heart of the child, 
and become a part of his experience too. 
The stories should be short and pointed. If the 
object of the lesson is to teach the child to repeat them, 
giving him power in narration, they should be short 
enough to be told, remembered, and repeated in one

lesson. For little children, short fables and anecdotes 
should be chosen. They should be repeated by the 
teacher until they have been absorbed by the child, and 
then they should be told over and over again by the 
children. In this repetition the teacher should insist 
upon a definite order of telling, a complete and concise 
narration. The child need not necessarily reproduce the 
exact words of the teacher, but he should reproduce the 
meaning, — should learn to tell the tale as it was told to 
him, to repeat it faithfully. He should tell it concisely, 
stopping when he is done, driving the nail home. His 
practice in story-telling teaches the child to arrange the 
parts of the story in the natural order, develops ease 
and fluency of expression, and,—nor is this the least 
important result, — aids him to become more ready and 
easy in conversation. 
Often it is well for the teacher to read entire books 
or stories of some length to the children, in order thus 
to interest them in the right type of literature. It is 
well to set aside a period on the programme for such 
reading. The children will show a marvellous power 
to retain and repeat the story. We have seen twelve 
pages of manuscript which a child in a primary third 
grade wrote after hearing the story of the Conquest of 
Mexico; and his manuscript was nearly equalled by all 
the other children in the grade. Another class of chil- 
dren were ready to tell the story of “ Little Lord Faunt- 
leroy” from the beginning to the end, even repeating 
accurately dialogues occurring in the story. No exercise 
gives the child greater enjoyment than does this story: 
telling; and if it is wisely conducted, no exercise is 
more profitable. 
The poem should be handled delicately in the lan-

guage lesson. It isa spiritual thing. It should be 
taught only by some one who is thoroughly in sympathy 
with it, who loves the poem, and desires to teach it; 
nor: should it be dissected too roughly. The poem 
should be chosen because the teacher enjoys it, as well 
as with the thought of adapting it to the children. It 
should be in line with the subject studied, fastened to 
some story of noble deeds, or to some study of wayside 
flowers, or to the signs of the passing season. Often the 
poem should be read and re-read without comment, 
until the children have imbibed something of its spirit, 
and until they question its meaning. Again, it should 
be presented to them as a picture, as in some of the 
studies that follow this chapter. In other cases the 
words should be studied until they become clear chan- 
nels for passage of the thought, clear windows through 
which the child looks out upon new landscapes. The 
poem should be read as a whole before any such study ; 
and all the study of the words should be considered as 
an attempt to throw side lights upon the picture as a 
whole, that the children may see it more clearly, and so 
the better appreciate it. 
The story of the life of the author, as far as the 
children may enjoy it, should come after the study of 
the poems, and not before. Their only need of knowing 
the author is because they have heard his message, and 
so his life becomes of value to theirs. Teach the poem 
first ; tell of the author afterward. 
This study of poems should include also the memory 
gem, the jewels set in few and fitting words which can 
be learned in the odd minutes of the day, and repeated 
over and over again in the fragments of time. Some 
memory gem should be always upon the board in every

schoolroom. If the children cannot read it, still let it’ 
appear for the service it may do the teacher. It helps 
to give the thought wings, and to lift the ideal out of 
the treadmill which the routine of the school may. so 
easily become. Some teachers open their school with 
the repetition of the memory gems which the children 
have learned; others close the day’s work with the 
same exercise. “I like to begin the day well,” says the 
one teacher. “TI like to send the children home with a 
good thought in their minds,” rejoins the other. Both 
are right. The writer remembers a silver-haired old 
man whose eyes glowed and whose face was illu- 
mined as he repeated long extracts from Goldsmith’s 
“Deserted Village” or from Pope’s “Essay on Man,” 
which he had committed to memory as a boy in school. 
Over and over again the pictures which the poet paints 
so well had gladdened his thought; over and over again 
his mind was carried back to the happy days of child- 
hood when he learned his lesson. Who can tell how 
many times the poet’s picture had comforted and in- 
spired him? To many a life the strong words of the 
Psalms come back in the same way with healing and 
inspiration at times of deepest need, when no other help 
is near. These seeds have been sowed in childhood, to 
bear fruit a hundred-fold in maturer life. We cannot 
spare these lessons from our schoolroom. There must 
be time for the story, the poem, and the memory gem.
-P-A-G-E-152
IIL. 
READING. 
I. AIM. 
ss Ho shall reading be taught?” and, “What are 
the aims in teaching reading?” are questions 
which should be answered by every teacher who 
attempts to teach a child to read. The second ques- 
tion should be first, for the aims in teaching reading 
will largely determine the method. A clear under- 
standing of the “why” definitely shapes the “how.” 
The teacher's comprehension of the purpose of her 
work causes every lesson to trend in harmony with 
that purpose. 
Let us look for the purpose in teaching reading. 
To that end let us inquire what reading is. 
I read a letter from my sister, telling me of her stay 
in Rome and the new scenes she is looking upon. 
What do I get from the letter? My sister’s thought 
about Rome. I read in the paper the account of 
Lieutenant Peary’s expedition through the frozen 
zone, and I get new thoughts of the life in Greenland. 
Through my reading I am getting thought. Reading 
is thought-getting. We vead when we get the thought 
expressed in the printed or written page. 
But that is not all. Nothing is really ours until we 
have shared it. Our conception of reading is not com- 
plete until we have added to our thought-getting the 
thought-giving. The first is silent reading only, the
-P-A-G-E-153
AIM. 153 
  second is known as oral reading. It goes without 
saying that the power to give the thought depends 
upon the power to get the thought. 
Having decided upon the meaning of the work, let 
us be guided by it in shaping our teaching. If reading 
is getting and giving thought, a child reads only when 
he gets, or gets and gives, the thought expressed in 
the printed page. No naming of words, or repetition 
of sentences will count as reading unless the child 
masters, and so possesses, the thought expressed by 
these words. 
What does such reading involve? Let us see, — and 
in no clearer way can we see than by putting ourselves 
in the place of the children. Let us read a stanza: — 
“ The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, 
The lowing herd winds slowly o’er the lea, 
The plowman homeward plods his weary way, 
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.” 
Do you get the poet’s thought? Do you see the 
picture which he sees? Some one says frankly, “I 
am not quite sure. I have read the stanza a great 
many times, but I do not know who the curfew is.” 
Evidently he thinks the curfew is a man — the sexton, 
probably, who tolls the bell. Another explains the 
meaning of the word, — tells how it originated in the 
custom ordered by William the Norman, when England 
obeyed his word, and the peasants covered the fire at 
night at the sound of the curfew (couvre feu — cover 
fire) bell. So the sunset bell comes to be called the 
curfew. Yes, number one reads the line now, and sees 
why the curfew seems to toll the knell of the dying day. 
He could not get the thought before, because he did 
not know the meaning of the word. One element
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 READING. 
  involved in this thought-getting, then, is knowledge of 
the meaning of the words used. 
Further, it is necessary that the reader should know 
the form of the words read. He must recognize every 
word as representing some idea, and separate it from 
every other word expressing other ideas. Uncon- 
sciously, but nevertheless surely, we compare every 
word we see with the form of the word which we carry 
in our minds. This word is ‘the,’ and no other; the 
next is “curfew,” and no other. Knowledge of the 
form of the word is essential to thought-getting. And 
if the thought is to be expressed to others, the knowl- 
edge of the sound of the word is also essential. As to 
the words, then, reading involves knowledge of their 
meaning, form, and sound, and the perception of the 
form must instantly suggest the meaning and sound, so 
close is the association of the three. 
Reading as thought-getting must therefore be pre- 
ceded by lessons which prepare for reading. The child 
must be taught the meaning, form, and sound of words 
before he can read sentences made up of words express- 
ing thoughts. To keep before the child’s mind in his 
reading, the purpose of thought-getting, the teacher 
herself should recognize and clearly hold this purpose. 
The study of words should not be named reading, but 
simply word-study. The thought, which is the life- 
spirit of the sentence, should be chiefly emphasized in 
the reading lesson, and all barriers to. the thought- 
getting should be removed in the preparatory lessons. 
Since ignorance of the sound, the form, or the meaning 
of words would be a barrier, much attention must be 
given in the preparatory lessons to removing these 
obstacles.
-P-A-G-E-155
AIM. 155 
  
There is but one way in which the child can learn 
the meaning of new words, —the object, or quality, or 
action, or relation must be perceived through the senses. 
All new ideas — better, all primary ideas — are so 
obtained. If the word “orange” is to be presented 
to a child who has never seen one, the orange itself 
must explain the meaning of the word. A good picture 
is a partial substitute; a vivid description is next best. 
It pictures the unknown in terms of resemblance to 
what is already known. 
The teacher needs to distinguish between words that 
represent ideas entirely new to the child and those 
already familiar, and to supply herself with material 
for illustrating the new word. For this purpose, in 
primary classes, objects should be obtained when pos- 
sible. A collection of pictures is invaluable. The 
power to describe well is also indispensable. The new 
idea must be added to the child’s experience, and with 
it the word which embodies it. Without the idea the 
word is valueless, and only through the appropriate 
sense can this idea be gained. This truth is especially 
and prominently applied in the first-grade classes, but 
it is equally true of all grades. The difference in extent 
of application is due only to the fact that the older 
pupils have already largely acquired the ideas expressed 
in the vocabulary met in their reading. This process of 
acquiring ideas must occupy much of the time of the 
early lessons in learning to read. 
Having possession of the idea, — which is, we may 
say, the spirit of the word,—the child must become 
familiar with the form and sound which embody it. 
To this end the child is helped by all exercises which 
demand attention to form and sound. His power to  
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 READING. 
  
recognize and name different words depends upon his 
power to see resemblances and differences between 
forms. He must learn to observe forms attentively. 
Everything that helps him to recognize different forms, 
or to group those which are alike, will help him to this 
power of recognizing and remembering words. This 
truth should be remembered in planning busy-work, 
“so called. 
The child will observe most attentively that in which 
he is most interested. If he is thoroughly interested 
in the object whose name he is to learn, he will attend 
to that name. The name should be presented and the 
association fixed when the child’s interest in the object, 
picture, or description is fully awakened. Much of 
the monotonous drill upon word forms would be ob- 
viated through remembering and applying this simple 
principle. 
After the word has been thus presented, it must be 
repeated over and over again; that is, occasions for 
its use must be presented to the child. That is very 
different from repeating without any reasonable occa- 
sion, simply because the teacher so directs. If the 
child, of necessity, uses the new word in written and 
oral statements, — copies it in various relations, finds it 
among others, illustrates it by drawing, —it becomes 
his own, a part of himself, a part which he has found 
necessary to the expression of his thought. Such 
repetition or drill fixes the form in the child’s mind. 
Without such repetition, however vivid the first image 
of the word, it fades away, an unused and useless thing. 
It is use only which entitles us to hold our possessions. 
The child might learn an infinite number of words| 
through such presentation of the meaning and form,
-P-A-G-E-157
  
AIM. 157 
  
and yet be comparatively helpless in considering a new 
form, so varied are the form fashions of our English 
words. To enable him to help himself, he should 
associate the sound with the form, learn to resolve a 
word into its sound elements, and to recognize a new 
form through its likeness to those already familiar. 
Knowledge of the phonic values of the letters gives 
the child command over classes of words whose type 
he has learned to recognize, and thus renders him inde- 
pendent of the teacher in naming new words, or in 
recognizing the new form of words expressing familiar 
ideas. A part of the time allotted to word-study should 
then be given to drill in phonics, to the end that the 
child may become self-helpful in his reading. Further, 
this study of sounds leads to attention to sound, clear 
articulation, and distinct speech. Lessons in phonics 
will be outlined in the following pages. 
So much for word-study, which must prepare the 
way for reading. Now for the reading itself, which is 
thought-getting. 
Thoughts are expressed in sentences. The child 
should always read sentences, and read them for the 
thought which is in them, since reading is thought- 
getting. Should we not consider from the beginning 
the kind of thought the child gets? We learn to read 
that we may have the power to read the thoughts of 
others. At the same time that we teach a child to 
read, we should teach him to love and desire that which 
is good to read. His power to read should be a gate 
opening into fair, fruitful fields, not into treacherous 
and poisonous swamps. So great is the good, or so 
fearful the evil, that may come to a child through 
his added power, it behooves us to spare no pains to
-P-A-G-E-158
158 READING. 
  make this power work for righteousness, truth, and 
beauty. 
What thoughts should the child get? Only those 
worth the getting, — the high, the noble, the beautiful, 
the pure. That is, after all, the purpose in our learning 
to read. We might better never read if these fields 
were not open to us, and we used our power in learning 
of evil. And this purpose should dominate the teacher 
from the very beginning, should guide her in choosing 
even the first sentences which she places upon the 
board for the child. 
Now that script is so universally used in teaching 
beginners to read, the subject-matter of the first sen- 
tences can be shaped at the teacher’s will. The thought 
that determines our best school readers is in the same 
line, and as soon as the first steps in reading have been 
taken, the whole field of good literature is open to the 
young reader. How vital the need that from the begin- 
ning he be taught to consider language the vehicle of 
the best thoughts, so that he may turn at once to the 
best when left to his own choice. 
Let the teacher of little children, then, aim to make 
reading always the getting of good thoughts, —thoughts 
in themselves beautiful and uplifting. Choose the best 
for the child to read, and early teach him to recognize 
this purpose in his reading. 
We have spoken of our lessons which prepare the 
way for reading, but we have only partially prepared 
when we have worked with words. The reading of a 
poem or story depends upon power to see and to 
remember, to feel and to imagine. One who reads well 
possesses these powers in a marked degree. Our read- 
ing lessons must be so conducted as to develop these 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  
AIM. 159 
powers, and many another lesson, must help to this end. 
Read Whittier’s ‘‘ Barefoot Boy,” and observe the work- 
ing of your own mind as you read. Do you travel hand 
in hand with the Barefoot Boy through wood and fields? 
Do you see the “sand-rimmed pickerel-pond, and the 
walnut slopes beyond”? Are you sure “where the 
oriole’s nest is hung, and how the robin feeds her 
young”? Your power to read this depends, first, upon 
your having had, at sometime in your life, experiences 
akin to those of the Barefoot Boy. The more you have 
seen in brook and field and wood, the more you will 
read in the poem. The more you have loved the free 
country life, the better will you enter into the feeling 
of the poet, and share the experience of the boy. You 
paint the pictures which the poet describes for you, but 
you must get the colors from your own experience. 
You imagine the scenes because there has been some- 
thing like them in your life. Can you imagine a boy 
who has always lived in a back alley, reading that 
poem? How can he imagine fresh fields and clear 
waters, having known only dark walls and unwholesome 
gutters? Before he can be taught to read, he must 
broaden his experience. His horizon must take in the 
woods and fields, and he must share their happiness. 
We cannot do all this for all children; but we can 
remember that the child gets out of the sentence only 
such thought as he is able to experience, and then our 
teaching of reading will not stop with words. All 
lessons which awaken new ideas and thoughts, all les- 
sons which guide the imagination to new fields, all 
lessons which cultivate the feelings and enable the 
children to put themselves in the place of another, all 
such lessons are preparatory to good reading. They  
-P-A-G-E-160
    160 READING. 
  
help the child to interpret the printed page, to share 
the thoughts and experiences of others. The nature 
study brings the child into sympathy with the world of 
nature, furnishing him with ideas which are recalled by 
poem or story. The description of heroic deeds kindles 
the young imagination, and the child pictures himself, 
too, as a hero. Howcan one read of noble deeds if 
he has not experienced noble impulses? How can one 
imagine or express pity if he has never felt it? The 
reading presupposes living. All lessons which help the 
child to broader knowledge and to clearer interpretation 
of life are actual helps to good reading. The true read- 
ing lesson does not stop with word-naming, but rather 
tends to strengthen all the powers of the child and to 
widen his experience. 
II. PREPARATORY LESSONS. 
In the first grades, time is lost by beginning too early 
to read, before the child has taken the preparatory steps. 
It is essential that the teacher should have some definite 
idea of the range of the child’s thought. She should 
learn what he knows in various directions, where he has 
lived, what his home surroundings are, with what classes 
of objects he is best acquainted, how far he has observed 
these objects. She must inspire in him such confidence 
in himself and her as shall lead to free expression of 
what he knows. If an essential to reading is knowledge 
of the meaning of words, these preparatory conversa- 
tions must show the teacher what meanings are foreign 
to the child’s experience. If he is to express the thought
-P-A-G-E-161
PREPARATORY LESSONS. 161 
  which he gets through reading, he must first be accus- 
tomed to oral expression. The need of these first lessons 
is greatest when children have limited opportunities at 
home, are shy and timid in expression, or are hindered 
through associating with those who speak another lan- 
guage. With such children, a month’s lessons in 
language, in expressing freely their own thoughts, 
should precede any attempt to study the written word- 
forms. And in all classes in primary grades, these con- 
versation lessons should accompany the reading, to 
develop in the children the habit of free expression, to 
show the teacher the extent of their ideas, and to afford 
the opportunity of adding new ideas. A conversation 
about life on the sea should prepare the way for reading 
of the wreck of the “ Hesperus,” for example. Skipper, 
deck, waves, lighthouse, beach, seaweed, are unknown 
quantities to children who have never seen the sea. 
A talk which shows the teacher where the child’s 
knowledge ends, and which gives him the pictures of 
the life which the poem describes, is indispensable to 
the right reading of the lesson. So with stories of travel 
or tales from history. The lessons which serve to inter- 
pret the pages of the reading lesson are of first moment. 
In such lessons the teacher needs the quick insight 
which will enable her to recognize at once the limit of 
the child’s knowledge and the line where she needs to 
give information or otherwise present the new ideas, 
The exercise should not degenerate into prattle about 
what the children already know, nor should the teacher 
be the only one to express her thoughts. Guard against 
aimless lessons, Know before the conversation begins 
just what you aim to do, and then do it. 
Ir

  III. HOW TO GET EXPRESSION. 
“ How shall I get expression in reading?” is a ques- 
tion often asked. The means attempted are many. 
“Read as you would talk,” the teacher says, forgetting 
that the child talks ordinarily with teeth close together 
and no visible opening between the lips. “Let your 
voice fall at a period,” commands another, and straight- 
way the lesson becomes to the child a search for periods 
and an effort to remember the rule. The solution of the 
problem will never be reached in these ways. 
What do you desire? Expression, — expression of 
thought. The child is to give you the thought which 
he finds hidden in the sentence. What first? He must 
get it. What next? He must desire to give it, and 
realize that he is giving it. He should do this as natur- 
ally as he would toss a ball to’you. You must question 
as naturally as if asking him to toss the ball. But keep 
your mind and his on the ball, the thought. Avoid doing 
anything to direct the attention of the child away from 
the thought, to his inflection, his pronunciation, his atti- 
tude, his manner. Hold to the thought now and take 
another time for these items, when they can be first. It 
matters little whether the lesson is in first grade or 
eighth, the fashion of it is the same. Little Kate reads 
word by word the sentence, “ Mary wore her new brown 
dress to school yesterday.” Her voice is low and timid 
because she is not sure of her power. “Read again, 
Kate; tell me what Mary wore to school yesterday.” 
“Yes, and now tell me where she wore her new dress, 
And now tell me when she wore it. Perhaps Mary 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
HOW TO GET EXPRESSION. 163 
  
has two new dresses. Tell me which one she wore to 
school.” By this time Kate has forgotten to be shy, 
and she has a message to deliver in answer to your ques- 
tions. “ Now tell Jennie what Mary wore yesterday. Tell 
Paul. Tell me again.” If instead, the teacher should say, 
“Emphasize brown, or yesterday, or new,” or “ Make 
these words strong,” the child thinks of the words and 
emphasis, not the thought. And she does less thinking, 
by far, than when questioned as above. The more she 
thinks, the better her expression will be, because she has 
more thought to express. The words now represent 
ideas to her. 
John, in the higher class, is reading “ Paul Revere’s 
Ride”: — 
“ A hurry of troops in the village street, 
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark, 
And beneath, from the pebbles in passing, a spark 
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet — 
That was all, — and yet, through the gloom and the light, 
The fate of a nation was riding that night, 
And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight, 
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.” 
How can we help John to read this with expression? 
By enabling him to see the picture he describes, to take 
the place of the brave rider, to live again through the 
stirring events of those Revolutionary days, to feel the 
pride and courage of the hour. Stir his imagination. 
Forget the school walls, the familiar desks, and ride in 
the dark through the village street on your momentous 
errand. And John will ride too. 
Then would you do nothing with breathing exercises 
or vocal drill, nor ever show a pupil how to hold his 
book? Yes, if John’s enthusiastic rendering is hindered

  by the habitual tension of his organs of speech, give 
special exercises that will lead to freedom of these 
organs. Short sentences may be sung through the dif- 
ferent tones of the scale. Familiar sentences may be 
used for practice in slow or rapid reading, cheerful or 
sad tones. Lists of words involving the troublesome 
sounds may be pronounced again and again, clearly, 
slowly, rapidly. But these exercises should be given at 
a time separate from the reading lesson, if possible. In 
the reading, emphasize reading. . 
IV. SUGGESTIVE HINTS. 
Much time should be given the pupil for silent read- 
ing, when he gets the thought for himself without the 
aid of teacher or classmate. The need of the lesson is 
twofold: the teacher must test the child’s power to get 
the thought alone, and the child must learn how to 
study. A most helpful exercise is that in which the 
teacher questions the class upon the lesson studied, so 
as to necessitate silent reading before the replying. 
Her questions should be clear, definite, searching, 
leading to clear and definite thought on the part of 
the child. Such questions will lead him to recognize 
each sentence as having a message to deliver to him. 
“ By the shining Big Sea Water, 
Stood the wigwam of Nokomis, 
Dark behind it rose the forest, 
Rose the black and gloomy pine-trees, 
Rose the firs with cones upon them; 
Bright before it beat the water, 
Beat the clear and sunny water, 
Beat the shining Big Sea Water.”
-P-A-G-E-165
    SUGGESTIVE HINTS. 165 
  
“What are we reading about?” “The wigwam of 
Nokomis.” ‘What do we learn about the wigwam?” 
“Tt stood by the shining Big Sea Water.” “Can you 
see this Big Sea Water? How does it appear?” 
“Shining.” “Why?” “The sun shines upon it.” “How 
do you know?” “It is called the Sunny Water.” “Can 
you see across it? How far does it reach?” “Is it 
quiet?” ‘No; it beats against the shore.” ‘Before the 
wigwam is brightness. Do you see anything else?” 
Darkness behind it.’ “ What makes it seem dark?” 
“ Dark pine-trees and firs.” “Are they large or small as 
you see them? What is the shape of the firs? What do 
you see upon them? Can you draw the picture?” 
Such study of the lesson with the teacher shows the 
child how to study by himself, and keeps him from 
simply naming the words on the page without get- 
ting the thought. These lessons should be given fre- 
quently in second and third grades. They may be 
followed by reproduction of the material in the child’s 
own words. 
Picturing with pencil.— A help to see the picture 
which the sentence suggests is the picturing with the 
pencil. The imagination works more definitely, and the 
words grow to have definite meaning, as the child pic- 
_ tures his thought. This suggests profitable busy-work 
for primary grades. The accompanying illustrations 
show work done by children in the first school-year in 
illustrating the poems and stories read to them. 
This picturing serves a double purpose. It not only 
helps the child to the recognition of the idea in the 
word, and impresses that idea, but it also affords to the 
teacher a picture of what-is in the child’s mind, and so 
helps to guide her teaching.

  Reading to children. — If we would have the children 
love what is good in literature, we must early familiarize 
them with it. No literature has a stronger hold upon us 
than that which we loved as children. Into our child- 
hood associations were woven the poem and story, so 
that the charm of the early days comes back with the 
familiar words. Long before the child learns how to 
analyze the poem or essay, and to weigh the words which 
the author has chosen, he feels the spirit of the story 
and is unconsciously uplifted by it. There is a period 
of absorption of literature which must precede analysis 
of literature. Read to the children much and often, but 
only the best: so will you keep before them the ideal 
which will unconsciously influence their choice as they 
enter the world of books. Recall in their walks through 
woods and fields the beautiful pictures of Whittier’s 
“Barefoot Boy.” Let the snow-fall suggest the dearly 
loved “Snow-bound.” Bring Hawthorne to tell his 
“Wonder Stories,” and Longfellow to sing the music of 
his “ Hiawatha.” Read of the life of the Orient and the 
old days of Greece and Rome. Tell the true stories of 
noble deeds. Keep high ideals, both of thought and 
expression, vefore the children, and kindle in them the 
desire to explore for themselves these Elysian fields of 
which you have given them a glimpse. 
The newspaper. — What has been said of the ideals 
which should be presented to children may serve as an 
argument against using the newspaper in the schoolroom. 
In neither subject nor fashion of expression does it serve 
as amodel. There is much in the columns of the daily 
paper which we would withhold from a child. As an 
avenue for information it may be useful to mature 
minds, but we cannot afford to use it before the standard 
of literature is fixed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  
SUGGESTIVE HINTS. 167 
  
Supplementary reading. —The use of supplementary 
reading has become so general that we can hardly speak 
of it as supplementary ; it has become incorporated into 
the work of all progressive schools. The need lies in 
the fact that pupils memorize the contents of the pages 
of the one Reader long before they have conquered their 
difficulties, and there is no incentive to study the sen- 
tences or to closely observe the words which they con- 
tain. Supplementary reading presents the same words 
in new relations expressing new thoughts; and the child, 
desiring to obtain the new thought, is urged to closer 
attention and more earnest study. The multiplication 
of books suited for school Readers multiplies opportuni- 
ties for practice in interesting ways, and develops skill 
as it can only be developed, — by practice. 
Easy reading. — Much easy reading tends to ease, 
accuracy, and fluency, The attempt to read what is too 
difficult leads to halting and stumbling. The eagerness 
to read in an “advanced Reader” often results in fixing 
these faults, when an abundance of easy reading would 
give the necessary skill. 
Concert reading. — Reading in concert is a device 
often adopted by teachers in the hope of accomplishing 
more work than in individual reading. The hope is not 
founded upon principles of teaching nor knowledge of 
children. A little careful observation shows us that in 
concert-reading the bright child or the loud-voiced boy 
leads, the others waiting to follow. The result is a 
dragging chant which has in it neither life nor thought, 
and which effectually prevents the natural and easy 
expression which should be cultivated in all the lessons. 
The only place for concert-reading is in vocal exercises 
when the selection is easy or familiar, or in the recitation 
of gems already completely memorized.
-P-A-G-E-168
  168 READING. 
  
A term in common use among teachers is “ sight 
reading,” used to denote the reading of books not in 
daily use, and without preparation. The object of such 
exercises is to test the pupil’s power to read, and to 
afford practice in reading without previous study. The 
material chosen should be less difficult than that se- 
lected for the lessons to be studied. As our Readers 
are graded, the pupil should use as “sight Readers” 
the Reader of the grade below his own. 
The exercise in reading at sight is not so valuable to 
the child as the lesson to which he has given previous 
thought, and should not usurp the place of the prepared 
lesson. It serves as an excellent test, however, and 
possesses the charm of novelty which enhances the 
interest in the lesson. 
V. LESSON IN READING. 
(Grade 3 to 5.) 
Subject. — Longfellow’s “ Builders.” 
Purpose. — The ruling purpose in teaching the poem 
to children is to lead them to appreciate the loyalty to 
an ideal which inspires faithful work, even if the results 
are unseen, From this thought the pupils are led to 
look at the temple as a type of their own character, 
which they should build as loyally. 
Means. — Intelligent reading of the poem, with appli- 
cation of the truth to daily life of the pupil. 
Preparation. — See that the children already have 
adequate ideas which underlie the words used in the 
poem. The seen is used to interpret the unseen, and 
can serve as an interpreter only when intelligently  
-P-A-G-E-169
LESSON IN READING. 169 
  understood. In the poem the building is used as a type 
of the unseen but real character. Direct the thoughts 
of the children first to some visible building which is in 
process of erection. Who plans the building? Who 
works to carry out the plan? What is the work of each 
one? What materials does each use? Where must the 
best work be done? What if some of the foundation 
stones are omitted or unevenly placed? What if the 
timbers are not well fastened together? What if the 
material is poor and worthless? I once saw a brick 
building over whose door a stone tablet bearing the 
builder’s name was seen. The building was nearly 
ready to fall because it had been cheaply built. What 
was it always saying of the builder? One summer as 
I rode through the country, I saw a fine farm whose 
fields were separated by solid stone walls. My friend 
said to me, “ Joe White built those walls. He is dead 
long ago, but his walls still stand. You can know them 
whenever you see them, they are so well built.” What 
were the walls always saying of their builder? In the 
old world are many beautiful cathedrals made of stone 
Some of them were hundreds of years in building. The 
plan was made centuries ago, and ever since workmen 
have labored to carry out the plan. In some of them 
are niches (explain) in which stone statues are placed. 
Some of these niches are high up in the walls where no 
one will ever climb. There are parts of these statues 
that will never be seen. The workmen knew this when 
they carved them, and yet these statues are perfect in 
every part. Why? What do they tell you of the 
workmen? (Show pictures of cathedrals.) 
Study of the poem.— Read entire poem to the chil- 
dren, and then ask them to read it aloud. Question
-P-A-G-E-170
  170 READING. 
after the reading. What does the poet call all of us? 
Where does he say that our work is? What structure 
do we build? What do we use to build it? By what 
means, with what tools, are we shaping to-day? A boy 
works hard to solve a problem in arithmetic, — does his 
very best; how is he shaping his to-day? Another 
copies his neighbor’s work; how is he shaping to-day? 
Another leaves undone to-day’s work; when can he do 
it? There is a “yawning gap between.” Who sees? 
Do you? Does any one? How wrought the old build- 
ers? How should we? How can we make ready for 
to-morrow’s work? When? 
Memorize and repeat often. Use the thought of the 
poem in appealing to the scholars for faithful work. It 
should impress the ideal of honest, faithful, every-day 
work, and should lead the pupils to respect such work. 
The next step is to lead them to choose it.

IV. 
SPELLING. 
HAT are we asking a child to do when we ask 
him to spell? To hold the picture of the 
word in his mind so exactly that he can reproduce 
the form in writing, or name in order the letters which 
make the word. How shall he be taught to do this? 
Spelling involves power to recognize and remember 
form. This power can be gained only by observing 
forms, — seeing resemblances and differences. The 
child is helped toward good spelling by every lesson 
in which he observes forms, and notes their resem- 
blances and differences. Drawing, writing, reading, 
word-study, all help to make the good speller. But 
there must be also definite lessons in which the child 
gives his attention to the forms of words, with the 
intention of reproducing them. 
Another power that is needed in spelling is the 
power to associate with the sounds included in a word 
the characters which’ represent them. Many of the 
words in the English language must be spelled by 
sight alone, since there is no phonic law which gov- 
erns them. But there are many large classes of words 
which are spelled exactly as they are pronounced, and 
a knowledge of the sounds of the letters at once gives 
the key to the pronunciation. Besides observation of 
form, the child must give attention to sounds. He 
must know all the possible sounds of the letters, singly 
iz  
-P-A-G-E-178
178 SPELLING. 
  and in combination. In teaching children to spell, 
then, we must aim toward these results, — power to 
see the word so clearly as to hold it accurately in 
memory, and reproduce it exactly; and as a means 
toward this end, attention to the sounds of the letters, 
so that the phonic laws which govern our spelling may 
help in this reproduction. 
The recognition of this purpose would give definite- 
ness to the spelling lesson, and enable the teacher to 
dispense with much of the aimless droning over words. 
The first step in learning to spell is learning to see 
and distinguish forms. There are many varieties of 
exercises that are helpful in this direction. For the 
little children, cut cardboard or pasteboard into differ- 
ent forms and sizes, and teach the children to assort 
them, placing together those which are alike. Letters 
printed upon cardboard may be used in the same way, 
and words are next in order. Cut from any newspaper 
acolumn or paragraph of print, and instruct the chil- 
dren to draw a pencil-mark through every word which 
is like the copy you place before them. In order to 
do this, the child must keep in mind the form of the 
word which he is to recognize and mark. And this 
holding the form in mind is the first requisite for good 
spelling. 
The next step is accurate copying of the word set 
before the child. Many teachers begin the oral spell- 
ing too soon, ignoring this important step. Copying 
the word from the board fixes it in the mind. The 
next harder step is to copy it or write it from the mind- 
picture, the word being erased from the board. Much 
work of this order should be done in the first year of 
school,
-P-A-G-E-179
SPELLING. 179 
  The next and hardest step is naming the letters of 
the word in order, from the memory of the form of the 
word, While oral spelling is more difficult than written 
spelling, it is at the same time less helpful. We need to 
spell only that we may write. We shall need, in actual 
practice, to write a word a hundred times to once spell- 
ing it orally. The chief value of oral spelling is the 
roncentration of attention upon the mental picture 
which it requires, and the emphasis which it gives to 
syllabication and the phonic value of letters. It should 
be used to vary the spelling exercises, but the written 
spelling should predominate. 
Much is gained if the pupil is taught correct habits 
of study through the spelling lessons. It is a mistake 
to direct him to “study the spelling twenty times over,” 
or to write it ten times. He should learn from the 
beginning to observe each word carefully, fixing its 
form in mind in the shortest possible time, not the 
longest possible. He should decide for himself which 
word demands the greatest effort in its mastery, and 
apply himself to learning it. Such study of the lesson 
leads to power as well as knowledge. Let us illus- 
trate: The teacher has assigned as the spelling lesson 
these words, which I find at the head of a Third Reader 
lesson, — destroying, doubt, forward, instantly, vege- 
tables, result, clumsy, tongue. What should be her first 
question? “Which of these words are new to the 
children? (If any are already familiar, no time should 
be wasted in studying or copying them.) All are new. 
Then which are easiest? Those which can easily be 
spelled by sound: De-stroy-ing is easy; it could not 
be spelled otherwise. How many syllables? Pro- 
nounce the first; the second; the third. Cover it and
-P-A-G-E-180
180 SPELLING. 
  
write from memory. Now compare your copy with 
the word. What word next? Vegetables. How many 
syllables? What is the sound of g? Copy from mem- 
ory. What must we remember about doubt? 2 is 
silent. What is the sound of s in resw/¢? Like z In 
clumsy? The same. Anything new or hard about 
instantly? About forward? About tongue? Yes. 
ue, final, is silent; 0 has the sound of short ~; 2 andg 
are sounded together. Look carefully at the word, and 
fasten it so that it will not slip. Cover, and write it five 
times. Let no one fail on that word.” 
Such study is much more valuable than the indis- 
criminate copying or repetition of the letters. It 
centres the attention on the point of difficulty, and 
masters the form at once. 
Shall we require the children to use the words in 
sentences? Yes, if the meaning is new, or you wish to 
test their knowledge of the meaning. Otherwise the 
exercise is of no value in learning to spell. When 
the use of sentences is required, insist upon sentences 
which mean something, — not “I see some vegetables,” 
but “Turnips and carrots are vegetables;” “The heat 
is destroying the crops.” 
If it falls to the lot of the teacher to select words 
for spelling, she should aim to make the pupils familiar 
with three classes of words: — 
1. Words spelled in accordance with phonic law, so 
that each word becomes the key to all similarly spelled 
and pronounced, —as block, night. 
2. Words in common use, which must be frequently 
repeated in all writing, — as which, have, were, there, etc. 
3. Words which are unusual in their spelling, or 
must be spelled by sight, — as tongue, thorough, etc.
-P-A-G-E-181
SPELLING. 181 
Such words need not be spelled by sound, but it is 
helpful to analyze the sound of the word, showing what 
value is given to each letter; thus, in ¢ongue,o has the 
sound of short #, xg is a digraph, and final we is silent. 
Such attention to the word helps to fix the form in 
memory. 
Groups of words associated in meaning are easily 
learned by the pupils, — the association helps. Articles 
to be bought at a grocery, at the hardware store, to be 
seen in the kitchen, the parlor, on a farm, in the library, 
are among the many lists which may be chosen. 
The manner of conducting the spelling exercises 
should be varied, not only in order to arouse greater 
interest, and the attention which accompanies interest, 
but also to afford tests of the pupil’s power in different 
directions. The fashion of the method may be changed 
in many ways, to suit the personality of the teacher and 
class, but the following may be used to advantage in 
every schoolroom : — 
1. Dictation Exercises. — These are of two classes, — 
exercises which the pupils study in advance, and those 
which are given without previous preparation on the 
part of the pupil, as a test which may show the teacher 
in what directions the pupils need further study. A 
word as to the preparation and correction of work in 
the first-named exercises. 
The selection to be studied should be written neatly 
upon the board, unless it is contained in some text- 
book which all the pupils possess. Before they attempt 
to study it their attention should be called to the points 
which they need to study most carefully. Is it prose 
or poetry? If the latter, how is each line written? 
What is the zew word in the first line? How spelled? 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
  182 SPELLING. 
What marks of punctuation are used? Why? In the 
last papers written by the class, a certain mistake 
was made. What? What shall we remember in this 
writing? 
Every teacher should have in her schoolroom a cam- 
bric curtain which slides on rings upon a cord, and 
which can be readily moved to cover any part of the 
blackboard. If the dictation exercise is placed upon 
the blackboard early in the morning, the curtain should 
cover it until time for use, that the exercise may be 
fresh before the eyes of the children and so their inter- 
est may be better secured. While the class studies the 
lesson, the curtain is drawn aside. When the time for 
recitation comes, the teacher can easily cover the exer- 
cise with the curtain, thus removing all temptation to 
copy, and yet retaining the selection for future use. 
When all are in readiness for the writing, the teacher 
should read once, slowly and clearly, the sentences to 
be written, but once only. If the child knows that he 
will be given repeated opportunities to get the sentences 
he will not listen so carefully. It is fair to say, however, 
that the teacher’s pronunciation should be distinct and 
her voice clear. Much of the child’s power to listen 
well depends upon her power to speak well. 
Guard against interruptions during the dictation. Let 
the undivided attention be given to the words to be writ- 
ten. If John asks one question and Kate another, all the 
children stop to listen. If a window must be closed or 
a door opened, let it wait for the moment, rather than 
turn the thoughts of all the class away from the dicta- 
tion to the window or door. In the teacher’s endeavor 
to correct pupils she often so emphasizes the fault as to 
draw the attention of the entire school away from the
-P-A-G-E-183
SPELLING. 183 
  lesson in hand, and then she wonders why the pupils 
are inattentive. Help the children to habits of attention 
by your own attention to the lesson. 
After the writing is done the exercises should be cor- 
rected. Will you have the pupils correct their own fail- 
ures, or correct one another’s, or will you correct all 
errors for them? Noone method is good enough to 
exclude all the others. “ My pupils cannot correct their 
own mistakes,” saysone. “Why not?” “ Because they 
do not see them, or else are not honest enough to say that 
they do.” The best of reasons, these, for using the first 
method. The pupil does not see the mistakes because 
he has in mind the wrong picture of the word and 
repeats the mistake which he has made in writing it. 
‘Teach him to compare his work with the original pattern 
upon the board, not with the image in his mind. Re- 
move the curtain and compare, line by line. Is the 
boy dishonest in his corrections or report? Then help 
him to feel that honesty is better than a seemingly per- 
fect paper. Your comment and approval will effect this 
if stress is laid upon the right thing. The training in 
correcting his mistakes is quite as valuable to the pupil 
as the first writing of the exercise. Instead of individ- 
ual correction of their own papers, the children may 
exchange with their neighbors, in some regular order. 
This method is good, for many reasons. It gives the 
children opportunity to compare their own work with 
another’s. It ensures marking the spelling or punctua- 
tion for what it is, not what it is meant for. “Oh,” 
complains John, “ Jack has marked my word wrong, and 
I spelled it right.” ‘He wrote a W instead of an M,” 
says Jack. And if the teacher is wise the M that looks 
like a W is marked wrong, until John learns thereby to 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  184 F SPELLING. 
  be more careful. Such criticism may be made very 
helpful to both critic and criticised. Great pains should 
be taken to encourage an honest, friendly spirit in criti- 
cism. Guard against the comparisons which exalt the 
work of one at the expense of another. Encourage the 
spirit which rejoices in another’s well-doing or progress. 
This is worth more than a perfect paper in spelling. 
But the one need not be sacrificed to the other. 
Neither method of correction above described will 
take the place of the teacher’s personal supervision of 
the work. It is not necessary for her to look at all 
papers every day, but she should see them often enough 
to know how every pupil progresses. The pupil prizes 
her personal recognition of his good work. Her eye 
will discover in his papers what he would never see, for 
his mistakes are typical to her and tell of lines in which 
he needs to work. 
The chief value of the examination of the papers is 
that the discovery of mistakes prevents their recur- 
rence. This is true only when the teacher calls the 
attention of the child to the error and leads him to 
remedy it. The child must learn to profit by his failure, 
and to avoid any repetition of it. See that the misspelled 
word is carefully studied and repeated. 
2. Oral Spelling. —In oral spelling the word should 
be pronounced by the child before spelling, to fix the 
attention upon the word and to show the teacher that he 
hears it correctly. In spelling, the syllables should be 
divided by slight pauses. The child should be trained 
to see the syllables in a word, and to separate the word 
into syllables. Such training helps in both pronuncia- 
tion and spelling. 
3. The Spelling Match.— The spelling-match is too
-P-A-G-E-185
SPELLING. 185 
  
good to lose. No other fashion of oral review so 
delights the hearts of the children. It should not be 
omitted. 
An interesting exercise is that in which each child 
names and spells a word beginning with the letter with 
which the last word ended. If number one spells wagon, 
number two may give xeedle, number three, error, 
number four, ready, etc. If the words are limited to 
a certain number of syllables, still more thought is 
required. Words may be required to begin with a cer- 
tain letter, to contain a certain letter, to be proper names, 
or may be verbs, adjectives, or nouns. Such variations 
add to both interest and profit. 
The spelling should include word analysis, and phonic 
analysis. Children should know all the sounds of the 
letters before leaving primary grades, and should be able 
to make words containing given sounds. Careful atten- 
tion should be given to rhymes, to words spelled alike 
but pronounced differently, and to words pronounced 
alike but spelled differently. Lists of words illustrating 
some of the fundamental rules of spelling should be fre- 
quently given. The following will suggest many others 
which the teacher should prepare for the class. 
I. Words alike in termination : — 
back hack Jack lack pack rack sack 
tack black crack clack whack knack 
II. Words derived from same root: — 
call calling caller called recall miscall

GEOGRAPHY. 
I. AIM AND PLAN. 
EOGRAPHY is the study of the earth as the 
home of man, and the chief aim in studying 
geography is to know the earth in relation to man, to 
study the natural forces, animal and plant life, climate, 
location, divisions of land and water, to learn how they 
contribute to, how modify, the life of man, and to rec- 
ognize the laws by which man’s life is governed. The 
early study of geography should be given to observa- 
tion of the life at home, near the child, — nature as he 
sees her in his home surroundings. Through the early 
lessons he must become familiar with the life of the 
animals and plants in his neighborhood; with the 
movements and appearance of sun, moon, and stars; 
with the work of frost and rain and sun; with the 
minerals and soils; with the fields and brooks. Through 
learning to observe these definitely and thoughtfully 
he possesses himself of ideas which will help him to 
interpret all truths of geography later. He can only 
know the life of the Esquimau in Greenland by seeing 
first the winter life in his own home and imagining the 
related conditions in the still colder country. The 
orange which he has seen in the market, and the plants 
in the greenhouse, help him to imagine the orange 
groves in California and Florida. The study of the
-P-A-G-E-188
- 188 GEOGRAPHY. 
  
wayside brook leads him to understand the river Nile 
and the Ganges. The fern that he sees by the familiar 
brook must help him to interpret the tropical forests 
of ages ago. The life of the kitten and dog which are 
his playmates introduce to him the tiger and the wolf. 
The corn in his garden patch must grow to represent 
“ the great harvest of Kansas, and the little field of grain 
widen. to tepresent the wide farms of the Dakotas. 
The hill up which he draws his homely sled must rise 
in height till it typifies the Himalayas. The little pond 
on which he skates in winter and by whose edges he 
watches for frogs or water-lilies, or where he fishes in 
summer, must widen its borders as he pictures the 
Great Lakes or even the wide ocean. The messages 
that he learns from flower and bird and. bee, help him 
to interpret the lives of plants and animals everywhere. 
The study of the blacksmith’s forge or shoemaker’s 
bench, the work of the “ butcher, the baker and cabinet- 
maker,” as he sees them day after day in his own 
neighborhood, lead him to understand the commercial 
conditions and occupations of men. His little barter- 
ings with his mates are the type of the commerce that 
covers the ocean with sails. Watchful, thoughtful, 
sympathetic study of the world at home prepares him 
to know the world abroad. 
It must follow then that the early lessons in geog- 
raphy are simply lessons in observation of natural ob- 
jects. The science lessons lead the way to geography. 
All lessons which enable the child to see clearly that 
which lies about him and then to picture from that the 
related unknown, thus developing his powers of obser- 
vation and imagination and interpretation, are really 
fundamental lessons in geography. The study of geog- 
   
-P-A-G-E-189
  
AIM AND PLAN. 189 
——_— 
raphy as such may not begin before the third grade. 
In that year of school one period a day may be given 
to oral geography lessons, to related observation les- 
sons, and reading which will lead the thought of the 
child away from home to the home of other boys and 
girls and the conditions which surround their lives. 
Through this observation and reading, the imagination 
should become sympathetic, and the child should be 
taught to put live conceptions under the otherwise dead 
words of his geography. After a year of the study 
here outlined he ought to be able to work from books, 
interpreting the words there used and making the pic- 
tures real and the experiences actual. 
A part of this year’s oral work should be given to 
excursions, which will give the children new power to 
observe, not only plant and animal life, but the forms 
of land and water and the forces at work to produce 
them. All the natural features of the country near at 
hand, the brooks, the ponds, the meadows, the hills, 
should be observed, drawn, described; and the teacher, 
by her thoughtful questioning should lead the children 
to question their surroundings, to ask why the pond is 
where it is, why the brook flows in the direction in 
which it does flow, why the grass grows greenest in 
one part of the meadow, why pines are found in one 
section and dwarf oak in another, how the pebbles are 
rounded, how the leaf mould is deposited, “how the 
robin feeds its young or the oriole’s nest is hung.” 
The chief object of the excursion should be not so 
much to accumulate knowledge through the teacher’s 
description of what she sees as to develop in the chil- 
dren the habit of thoughtful seeing, questioning, and 
imagining. Outline lessons given later will suggest
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 GEOGRAPHY. 
  some of the work. A full and most excellent outline 
has been prepared by Mr. Frank Murdock, of the 
Bridgewater State Normal School of Massachusetts. 
The teacher will find its pages most helpful and 
suggestive. 
Another form of the oral lessons should be the study 
of the occupations of the people, and this study should 
be so conducted that the child will come to realize the 
one great truth that all men have their work to do and 
that all are working together for the good of the whole. 
Lead the child to question what people have been at 
work in order that he might have his morning’s break- 
fast, his dinner, or his supper; what people must labor 
and how, in order that he may have the schoolroom 
with its furnishings; what animals, what plants, what 
people, have contributed to his clothing; what labor 
has entered into the manufacture of the books which 
he reads, his toy, or the utensils with which he works. 
Description of the work which each trade involves, the 
materials which are used, the tools which the workman 
must employ, the wages which he receives, the condi- 
tions under which he labors — all these may be dis- 
cussed by even the lowest classes; and this description 
should lead not only to knowledge and thoughtfulness, 
but to a realizing sense of the dignity of labor and 
responsibility that rests upon us all to do our part in 
the work of the world. No other subject is more help- 
ful, none tends more truly to help the child to rid him- 
self of selfish love of ease and fit him to do his part of 
the world’s work. ‘ 
Another subject for discussion should be the build- 
ings of the city, the streets, the parks, the schools, and 
the government. Who pays for the erection of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
  AIM AND PLAN. Igl 
City Hall or the Town House? Who pays for the 
paving or straightening or the widening of roads? For 
laying of sewers, for the lighting of the streets? Who 
provides the schools and pays for their maintenance? 
Why is it right for them to do this? Why do they 
do it? What is the need of government in the home; 
in the base-ball match; in the tennis game; in school; 
in city; in the state? Why should rules be made, and 
by whom should these rules or laws be obeyed ? 
Following the outline thus suggested, the child 
should learn the representation of places by the dia- 
gram or map as a preparation for map study. The 
object of these lessons will be to enable him to inter- 
pret maps, to read the lessons which they have in store 
for him, and to express his knowledge of place and size 
and relative position by means of maps and diagrams. 
It is a mistake to lay too much stress upon this depart- 
ment of geography. It is only one phase of the work 
which the child should do. The life study which has 
preceded this work is the more important of the two. 
In order to understand the meaning of the map, the 
child must learn to represent familiar places by maps 
or diagrams. He should begin with the school desk, 
should measure it accurately, and then draw by scale 
a representation of its surface. Upon this diagram he 
should name the directions, north, east, south, and 
west, and learn the arbitrary law that the top of the 
map represents north, and the bottom south, and the 
right-hand east, the left-hand west, etc. From the 
desk his next step should be the diagram of the school- 
room, placing the doors, windows, desks, teacher’s desk, 
etc. This, too, should be drawn from accurate meas- 
urements, that the child may get the idea that the
-P-A-G-E-192
192 GEOGRAPHY. 
  map represents proportionate and not actual distances, 
relative and not absolute size. The drawing of the 
school-yard is next in order; then the representation of 
one or two of the main streets of the town, with some 
of the prominent buildings.” This should be enough 
to enable the child to recognize the meaning of the 
lines that are used in representing different portions of 
the earth’s surface, and to clearly interpret the maps 
used in his geography. Thus the maps should be 
studied by the child with the same observation and 
thought which is involved in the science lesson. The 
child should see and think,—should question, and 
not simply answer the questions suggested in the text- 
book. Let him question his mates as to what they learn 
from the map, in order that he may be more eager to 
search for himself. Let the map study invariably pre- 
cede the study of the text, so fhat the child may learn 
to think for himself instead of accepting the statements 
of others. He looks at the map of North America, 
sees the location of the river basins. What do they 
show of the slope and height of the land? Why does 
the Mississippi flow south, and the McKenzie River 
northwest? The St. Lawrence southeast? Why are 
the rivers of the eastern coast so short? Of what use 
can they be? What use can be made of the St. Law- 
rence and the McKenzie? Why? Suggest questions 
the child’s study of the map should answer, and such 
study will enable him to come with deeper interest to 
the words of the text. 
Preceding detailed study of the map, the lessons on 
the globe should be given; the form, size, movement, 
zones, the relations of land and water, should be con- 
sidered. This study of the earth as a whole should
-P-A-G-E-193
AIM AND PLAN. 193 
  
precede the detailed study of continents, countries, and 
States, in order that each of these may be considered 
in their relation to the larger whole. During the first 
years the child has been studying his own environ- 
ment, getting new ideas which will enable him to inter- 
pret life and conditions away from home. His thought 
has been reaching out, from the familiar to the strange, 
from the near to that which is far away. Now he must 
come to the study of the earth as a whole, for which 
his previous study at home has prepared him, and he 
must learn to recognize his home as a part of the great 
earth, influenced by the conditions which influence all 
life, which govern life in all lands. The study of the 
globe prepares now for the study of the continent. 
The study of the continent prepares the way for the 
study of the country; this is followed in turn by the 
study of the State, especially the child’s own State, 
which must be known in its relation to the others which 
with it make up the fatherland. Then the government 
and history and present conditions of the county, city, 
or town, may be intelligently understood. 
After this detailed study there should be a summing 
up of what the child has learned, — an analysis of his 
knowledge, a grouping according to subjects. Now he 
studies, not the country with its different interests, but 
some subject which is illustrated in all countries, — the 
river basins of the world, mountain systems of the 
world, winds and currents, governments, religions, 
races of men. Such review prepares the child for out- 
side reading in the lines in which he is interested, and 
deeper and clearer thinking. Such study prepares the 
way for the life-long study of the home of man.

II. SUGGESTIVE LESSONS. 
LESSON ON SNOW. 
(First Grade.) 
The general lessons for the month January were 
upon snow-crystals and other forms of water, and their 
uses. 
The aim of the work has been to cultivate the obser- 
vation, powers of expression, and the imagination. 
Parts of the poem by Lowell, “The First Snow-fall,” 
have been learned in connection with the work. 
The story which forms the basis for “The Snow- 
flake’s Story” was read by the class from the black- 
board as reading lessons. 
The class had previously read one chart, one primer, 
and considerable blackboard work. They had constant 
practice in reproduction. 
Amy V. ATKINS, Zeacher. 
THE SNOWFLAKE’S STORY. 
(Reproduction was written down exactly as given by pupil.) 
“How do you do, little snowflake? I am glad to see you. 
Where did you come from? Are you a winter flower? May 
I take you into the house?” 
“Tf you do, little girl, I will take off my winter dress.” 
“ Where do you live?” 
“TI live in the big sea. One day I thought I would like to 
travel. I asked some of my friends to go, too. Many said 
they would like to go. The cloud was our train and the wind 
was our engine. We rode over many cities and towns. We 
saw many rivers and ponds. One day we met another en-
-P-A-G-E-195
  SUGGESTIVE LESSONS. 195 
  gine. It was a cold wind and it made us cold. That was 
when we put on our winter dresses. 
“ This made us heavy, so we broke through our car and came 
flying down. 
“The children were glad to see.us. They runand jumped and 
said, ‘Oh, it is snowing!’ You see we did one good thing. 
We made the little people happy. 
“Now I will tell you about my dresses, My every-day dress 
is named water-drop. One of my dresses is named vapor dress. 
I put that on when I am too warm. It is a thin dress. One of 
my dresses is called a snowflake. I wear my snowflake dress 
when it is cold. My very thinnest dress is steam. You cannot 
see it at all. 
“T will tell you oe good thing I can do. When I am steam 
I can help make the engines go. 
“When I am a snowflake I help cover the little flowers so 
they will not freeze. When I am a rain-drop I help give little 
flowers their drink. 
“When I am on my way home I run down the hills, through 
the rivers and lakes to the sea. I feel very glad to get home.” 
Given orally by PAULINE THOMAS. 
LESSON ON THE WIND. 
(Second Grade.) 
i 
Object. — To lead the children to observe currents of 
air and to question first as to the cause, second as to 
their usefulness. Place light feathers over the stove or 
register. Thistle-down, milkweed-seed, or tinder, may 
be used in the same way. ‘“ What does the feather do?” 
“Tt rises.” “Why?” “Because the air carries it up.” 
“How does the air over the stove or register compare  
-P-A-G-E-196
  196 GEOGRAPHY. 
  
with that in the other part of the room?” “It is warmer ; 
it is heated.” “Then what air is moving from the 
stove?” “The heated air.” “In what direction?” “It 
is moving up, or rising.” ‘But if the heated air rises, 
taking the thistle-down with it, what must there be in 
the place where the heated air has been?” Other air 
comes in. If we open a window the air from the win- 
dow comes in toward the stove. The thistle or feather 
floated in other parts of the room will be drawn toward 
the heated current. When our boat is carried down 
stream by the water, we say it is moved by the current. 
We can speak of the moving air as a current. “Is the 
air in the room quiet or moving?” “It is moving.” 
“ How do you know that it is moving?” “ Because the 
thistle-down and feathers move with it.” “ What makes 
it move?” “The heated air rises and the colder air 
takes its place.” “If I put a piece of cork and a stone 
in this pan of water, what does the stone do?” “It 
sinks to the bottom.” “Why?” “ Because it is heavier 
than the water.” ‘What does the cork do?” “It 
floats.” “TI hold the cork in the bottom of the water; 
what does it do when I release it?” “It rises.” “Why 
does it rise?” “Because it is lighter than the water.” 
“Why does the heated air rise?” “ Because it is lighter 
than the other air.” ‘Then we have found that the 
heated air in the room is lighter than the colder air, and 
that it rises.” ‘Where does the cold air come from to 
take the place of the heated air?” “It comes from the 
sides of the room near the windows.” “In what direc- 
tion must it move?” “It moves toward the stove or 
register. If the stove is at the east side of the room 
the air moves toward the east and from the west. If the 
stove is at the west side of the room the air moves toward
-P-A-G-E-197
SUGGESTIVE LESSONS. 197 
  
the west and from the east.” “At recess we will notice 
the air out of doors and see whether it is quiet or 
whether it seems to be moving.” The children learn 
that it is moving and report after recess. ‘In which 
direction is it moving?” ‘Toward the north. It tore 
a piece of paper; it blew Johnnie’s kite; it blew the 
ends of my scarf.” “Why do you suppose the air out 
of door moves? Why does it move in the schoolroom ?” 
“ Because one place is warmer than another, and the air 
moves toward the warm place where the heated air has 
risen.” ‘So it must have been with the wind; air is 
moving toward a place which has been warmer and 
from which the air has risen.” 
II. 
“Yesterday we found currents of air in the room and 
out of doors, and we called these out-of-door currents 
wind. Yesterday the wind was blowing from the south. 
That was a south wind. The wind blowing from the 
north would be what?” “A north wind.” ‘A wind 
from the east?” “A wind from the west?” “A wind 
from the south-east?” “A wind from the south-west?” 
“ Let us see what the winds do for us. Who can tell? 
What is it that moves the arms of the windmill?” 
“What is it that moves the sails of the ships?” ‘ What 
is it that brings the clouds with the rain?” ‘“ What is it 
that dries the clothes on washdays?” “What is it that 
takes away the hot air from our faces and makes our 
rooms cool in the summer time?” When the air in 
the schoolroom becomes hot and stifling and unwhole- 
some to breathe, what does the wind do for us?” “If 
the air of the city becomes foul and bad, what does the 
wind do for it?” “The wind brings health on its wings.  
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 GEOGRAPHY. 
  It brings the rains that water the earth and make it bud 
and blossom. The winds help us to carry our messages 
and do our work. We could not live without them.” 
Let the children commit to memory the poem on the 
winds from “Open Sesame,” or recite the familiar 
lines, — 
“ Whichever way the wind doth blow, 
Some heart is glad to have it so, 
So blow it east or blow it west, 
The wind that blows, that wind is best.” 
Show the children pictures of a windmill, and tell them 
of the work done by windmills in Holland. Show the 
picture of a sail-boat, and talk of the work which the 
winds help us to accomplish. ‘The winds and waves 
are on the side of the ablest sailors.” Ask the children 
to explain the meaning. Tell them the story of Ulysses 
and the winds; of AEneas and AZolus, 
STUDY OF OCCUPATIONS. 
(Third Grade.) 
Lumbering. — Let us look about the room this morn- 
ing and name everything that we use that is made of 
wood. Yes, the desks, the floor, the doors, the casings 
and the blackboard, the window-frames, the seats, the 
frame of the clock, the wood of lead-pencil, the pointer, 
the back of the erasers, the entire frame of the building 
itself; all are made of wood. We could hardly have 
our school and prepare our lessons without this useful 
material. Where does it come from? Yes, from the 
trees. Where do the trees grow? In the woods. 
Where are the woods? Those nearest to us that are

  cut down for lumber are in the northern part of Minne- 
sota and Wisconsin. What should we see if we were 
in the pineries? Mile after mile of unbroken forest, 
tall trees, higher than our heads, birds, squirrels, bees, 
and brooks, wild flowers, but no man until the lumber- 
man comes to cut down the trees to be made into lumber 
for us. The tree must be felled. By whom? How? 
Its branches must be trimmed. It must be cut into 
logs, carried to the river bank, rolled into the river to 
be floated down a hundred miles — often two or three 
hundred miles, to the saw-mills. How does the lumber- 
man live while he is in the woods? What does he eat? 
Who cooks his food? What is his house? Who is with 
him? Are his wife and children, too, in the woods? 
Are there schools and churches, as we have? Does he 
work in winter or summer? What tools does he use? 
How does he get the logs to the river? How will the 
owner of the logs know them when he sees them? Will 
they float straight down the river till they get to the 
mill? Who takes care of them, — pulls them off sand- 
bars or snags or out of coves where the river bends? 
Who sees that they stop at the right place, -—at the 
right mill? What is the place called where the logs are 
kept before they are taken to the mill? What are the 
men called who take care of them? What tools do they 
use? Is their life easy or hard; dangerous or safe? 
What kind of men must they be? What is done with 
the log when it is taken into the mill? How is it sawed 
into boards? What moves the machinery? What men 
must work in the mill? Where are the boards placed 
after being sawed? Who buys them? Who moves 
them? Who works upon them? What men must work 
to complete the schoolhouse from the boards and beams?

SUGGESTIONS FOR A FIELD LESSON. 
(Primary Grades.) 
The school adjourns this afternoon to Mr. Raymond’s 
field, where they sit with their teacher in the shade of 
the old pine-tree, and hold their little note-books in 
hand, ready to record their discoveries. 
“Let us draw a map of the field,” the teacher says. 
“What is its shape?” “Square.” ‘ What is on the 
north side?” “Mr. Townsend’s field.” ‘ What sepa- 
rates this field from the one on the north?” “A stone 
wall.” “What lies east?” “The pasture.” ‘What 
separates this field from the pasture?” ‘The brook.” 
“What lies on the south?” “The orchard, with a 
fence between.” ‘And what lies west?” ‘The road, 
on the other side of the wall.” ‘“ What is the highest 
part of the field?” ‘“Ebenezer’s Hill. We slide down 
that hill in winter.” “In what direction do you slide?” 
“Toward the brook. That is the steepest side.” 
“Why do you choose the steepest side?” “ Because 
you go fastest and farthest. You can go way across the 
brook. The little ones slide on this side, where it is n’t 
so steep, but they don’t go so far as we do.” “Call the 
side of the hill the slope; hold your paper as you think 
this side slopes; now the side toward the brook; which  
-P-A-G-E-201
  SUGGESTIVE LESSONS. 201 
slopes most? Which slope do the little ones choose? ” 
“The easy one.” “Yes, or the gradual slope. The 
older boys choose the steep or abrupt slope.” 
“Suppose the brook were to start from the top of 
the hill; on which side would it run faster?” ‘“ Down 
the steep side, or the abrupt slope.” “Which would 
make the slower brook?” “The gradual slope.” 
“In what direction does the hill slope?” ‘Toward 
the east, and toward the north.” “ Which is the lowest 
part of the field?” “That part down by the brook.” 
“Look across the brook. The land slopes down to the 
brook there, too; which is the more gradual slope?” 
“The one on the other side.” “Lay two pieces of 
paper as the slopes lie. Where would you place the 
brook? What shall we call that low place between the 
hills? Yes, it is a valley. Let us look at the valley 
of the brook. Climb the hill and we can see better. 
What do you see?” “The hill slopes gradually to 
the south, and then ends in a flat meadow.” “Does 
the brook stop there?” ‘No, it runs on; I have fol- 
lowed it to the pond.” “Why does n’t it stop and make 
a pond in the meadow?” “It must be that the meadow 
does slope, even if we don’t see it.” “In which direc- 
tion do you think it slopes?” ‘Toward the south.” 
“Why?” “Because the brook flows south.” 
“Now let us go to the brook; throw a Jeaf into it. 
What becomes of it?” “It floats on the top of the 
water.” “Just where you dropped it?” “Oh, no; it 
is carried along.” ‘What carries it?” “The water.” 
“Why?” “The water is always moving.” “Why?” 
“It is trying to get to some lower place. Father says it 
is this brook that makes Centre Pond. That is where it 
goes.” “I will let you follow the brook with me on the

map by and by. Now Jamie may throw a leaf in the 
water and make it float toward me.” “Oh, but it 
won't!” “Why not?” Because that isn’t the way the 
water flows.” ‘The movement of the water is the cur- 
rent. The leaf flows with the current. Look to see if 
anything else is moving with the current.” “ Yes, sticks, 
dead leaves, and the grass in the water is moved as far as 
its roots will let it go.” ‘“ Where do the sticks and pieces 
of leaves move fastest?” ‘Near the middle of the 
brook.” ‘What does that show?” ‘“ That the current 
is strongest in the middle.” “The objects are moving 
down-stream. Point up-stream. What shall we call 
the ground that borders on the brook? Stand so that 
you can look down-stream. You all are on the left 
bank. Where is the right bank? How will you find 
the right bank of any brook? How will you know 
which way is down-stream? Which is higher, the 
right bank, or the left bank, of this brook?” 
“Suppose a great rock should be placed in the bed 
of this brook, what would happen?” “The water 
would run up against it, and then go around it.” 
“What would happen then?” After some discussion 
the children decide that the water would wear away the 
soft bank. “Is any part of this bank being worn away? 
Look and see. Run up and down the brook. See 
where the current is swiftest, and think why. Find 
places where the bank is wearing away. See if you 
find any rocks in the bed of the stream; any pebbles. 
How does the water appear as it runs over the stones? 
How do the stones affect the current? What do you 
find growing on the bank? In the water? What 
animals do you see? We will come again to watch 
them.”

SUGGESTIVE LESSONS. 203 
  Add the brook to the map of the field. Indicate 
direction of the current,— right or left bank. Children 
write, first, what they remember, unassisted; second, 
answers to questions. 
Commit to memory Tennyson’s “Song of the Brook,” 
or Sidney Lanier’s “Song of the Chattahoochee.” For 
further lessons, trace the brook back to its beginnings, 
study springs, and follow the life of a water-drop. This 
will involve lessons on vapor, clouds, rain and snow, soil 
and rocks, and the sea. Lead the thought of the chil- 
dren to the laws which are so beneficent, and which 
guide the raindrops and the brooks, and paint the 
colors of the rainbow. And lead them to associate 
with the brooks and the sea the thought of the poets, 
and the pictures in their poems. Encourage individual 
observation, and the use of pocket note-books. 
Lead from the brook to the river, the pond to the 
sea, the hill to the mountain, the meadow to the prairie. 
By learning to interpret his own surroundings, the child 
gains power to picture other lands.

NUMBER. 
N teaching number, as in all other subjects, the 
method will be determined by the end in view, -— 
the results which we hope to gain through our teaching. 
If we ask ourselves why we teach arithmetic, we may 
more readily determine how we should teach it. 
The one aim which has been uppermost in the minds 
of most teachers has been the obtaining knowledge. 
This is but one of the results to be secured, but it is an 
important one. Through the arithmetic lessons the 
child should gain clear and accurate knowledge of all 
the facts of number which are needed in his daily life, 
in buying and selling, in reckoning obligations and in 
meeting them. A certain fundamental knowledge is 
indispensable for getting our daily bread. Further than 
this there must be taught the essentials of arithmetic 
which are necessary to the future study of mathematics, 
if the child continues his course in school. And further 
still, and quite as important, is the knowledge which is 
gained simply to afford discipline in the getting. Knowl 
edge for daily use, knowledge for foundation of future 
study, and knowledge for discipline, should be obtained 
through. the lessons in arithmetic, 
But of greater value to the child is the power which 
becomes his through this knowledge-getting. If arith- 
metic is rightly taught, the child grows through the 
study in power of observation, power of thought, and  
-P-A-G-E-205
NUMBER. 205 
  
power of expression. All the primary ideas and truths 
of number must be obtained through observation; there 
is no other way in which they can be learned. The 
teacher who forgets this truth and endeavors to teach 
her child facts in number by simply causing him to 
reiterate her statements, is violating thd fundamental 
principle, and without doubt fails to accomplish her 
purpose. Only through observation can primary ideas 
be obtained. 
But observation is not enough for future acquisition 
of knowledge; the child’s observation must be thought- 
ful. Through his first seeing he learns fundamental 
truths which should always lead him to think out for 
himself other truths which depend upon these. Unless 
the observation is thoughtful, the child’s knowledge 
never extends farther than what his eyes can see. (The 
individual fact which he perceives must lead the way to 
the general truth which he apprehends through reason; 
and his lesson in arithmetic should develop the power 
of clear and definite reasoning. 
Added to the power of observation and thought should 
be greater facility in expression. The child’s obser- 
vation and thought are not complete until they have 
been definitely express¢d. This expression may be by 
means of figures, words, or drawings; but it must be 
accurately made in order that the thought may be 
fixed in accurate form, and that the teacher may learn 
through this outward expression to measure the child’s 
knowledge and power. 
The continued work along these lines will give to the 
child the essentials of knowledge that underlie future 
work, and by means of the processes involved will fix 
certain habits of thought and study. These habits are
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 NUMBER. 
  
accuracy of observation, definiteness of thought, and 
clearness of expression. In written work this accuracy 
and definiteness involve neatness in arrangement also. 
There should be no dimness of idea nor vagueness of 
expression nor carelessness in record of the questions in 
arithmetic. All the statements should be clear and 
straightforward, all results and processes should be 
accurate; a habit of definiteness and accuracy should 
grow in every lesson. 
The kind of lesson which the teacher will give must 
depend upon the end in view. A lesson to teach a new 
fact of knowledge will be given in one way, a lesson 
intended to fix the fact or to strengthen a habit or 
develop power should be given in another way. The 
teacher must clearly determine, before every lesson, 
just what she intends to accomplish through that lesson, 
and just how she intends to accomplish it. It is well 
for her to ask herself, as the class pass to their seats, 
what fact they have learned during this exercise, and 
she should be able to assure herself that certain knowl- 
edge has been imparted or certain powers have been 
strengthened by the exercise. / A lesson for the getting 
of new knowledge, or a devéldpment lesson, involves 
presenting a new idea to the child. The element of ob- 
servation predominates in all such lessons in the lower 
grades. If the child is to be taught the new fact that. 
six and two are eight, or that four quarts equal a gallon, 
the objects must be presented to him and he must be 
led to see their relations. If the truth is new to the 
child there is only one way in which he. can be led to 
see it, and that is by means of objects. He should be 
shown the six balls and two balls, the six pennies and 
two pennies, six rings and two rings, or he should see
-P-A-G-E-207
NUMBER. 207 
the four quarts measured and poured into the gallon 
measure. Such a lesson is often called a development 
lesson. It should be necessary only in presenting new 
ideas, and it should be followed always by thoughtful 
drill in which the child has abundant opportunity to 
repeat and apply his knowledge. Having seen that 
one gallon equals four quarts, he can think for himself 
that two gallons are eight quarts. Having seen that 
six and two are eight, he ought not to need objects 
when he comes to the fact that sixteen and two are 
eighteen, or that twenty-six and two are twenty-eight. 
Every fact that he perceives in the development lesson 
should be made the basis of all the related facts that 
can be associated with it, and this association should 
be a part of the drill lessons. 
Lessons for strengthening the power of thought and 
of expression and for fixing in the memory the pictures 
seen in the development lesson are drill lessons, and 
should supplement and complete the development les- 
sons. The work in arithmetic is not complete without 
the two phases. It is a mistake to emphasize one to 
the exclusion of the other. Each has its proper place, 
and if the teacher clearly comprehends the purpose in 
each lesson she will more thoughtfully shape her 
method. 
In all the development lessons the teacher should 
see that the pupils are prepared for the new truth that 
is to be taught. Everything upon which the new 
thought depends must be definitely in the mind of the 
pupil and clearly stated before the new thought is in- 
troduced. So the connection is fixed between the old 
knowledge and the new, and the lesson of to-day is 
related to the lesson of yesterday. Without such care- 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
208 art NUMBER. : 
  ful relation the work is fragmentary and weak. The 
isolated, separate lessons involve much loss of time and 
energy on the part of both teacher and pupil. It is 
useless to attempt to teach a definition of a cube when 
the children do not know how to define a square; use- 
less to attempt to teach the definition of a square before 
the children can recognize a right angle. See first that’ 
the ground is prepared for the new lesson and that all the 
facts relating to it are brought into the foreground 
by a careful and thoughtful review. 
Again, the new truth should be properly illustrated.’ 
If it is a fact which the child can get through observa- 
tion only, appropriate materials should be ready ‘for 
him to observe. If the new truth depends upon the 
one learned yesterday, illustrative problems should be 
used and the old steps carefully stated so that the one 
to-day is clearly recognized in its place. See that the | 
illustration illustrates simply the point to be taught in 
the lesson; see that the questions are clear and defi- 
nite, impelling the child to accurate observation or 
definite thought; and see that every statement or ob- 
servation or conclusion is accurately made. 
Having led up to the observation of the individual 
instances, lead the child to compare this with other 
instances until the individual truth becomes general. 
He sees that six apples and two apples are eight apples, 
that six cents and two cents are eight cents, that six 
“books and two books are eight books. He should 
continue this grouping with all objects which are fa- 
miliar to him until he is ready to recognize the general 
truth that six and two are eight. But this individual 
statement with familiar objects should always precede 
the general statement.

  ‘The purpose of the drill, as has been stated, is to fix 
in the mind of the child the facts observed and to de- 
velop skill in application of these facts. In order to 
achieve this result, ¢he teacher must test and question 
thoughtfully. She should work in the line of the child’s 
need. Do not drill over and over again upon some- 
thing which the child already knows. Nothing leads 
more surely to indifference and to slovenly habits of 
thought and expression. Lay stress upon the lines in 
which he is weakest. Know at the end of every reci- 
tation just what truths the child has in his possession, 
just what ones need to be presented anew, and what 
ones must be fixed by further repetition. Give the 
greater time to that which is more difficult. Let each 
lesson be a guide for the next, showing the teacher the 
lines in which she must work for the future. 
In the primary work in number the child should fix 
in his memory, after proper development, all the funda- 
mental combinations and separations which underlie 
the processes of addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
“and division. These facts are few in number if the 
teacher knows how to group them. The tendency is 
to give much time to drill upon facts in the multipli- 
cation, omitting the addition, subtraction, and division, 
which are quite as necessary. There are addition, 
subtraction, and division tables, as well as multiplica- 
tion tables, but unfortunately, the facts to be taught 
in these three lines are not so well classified in the 
teachers’ minds. All the facts which the child needs 
to know in addition and subtraction are revealed in 
the study of the numbers from one to twenty. If the 
child masters these he has the key to all the rest; for 
example, when he learns that 2 and 7 are 9, he has the 
14
-P-A-G-E-210
210 NUMBER. 
  
key to the 12 and 7, which are 193 the 32 and 7, which 
are 39. Whenever he finds 7 and 2 to be added, in 
whatever order or kind of units, the sum is always 9. 
When he learns that 8 and 7 are 15, he is preparing 
the way for the 28 and 7,58 and 7, 98 and 7, and so 
on. These tables of endings in addition should be 
as carefully observed and memorized as the common 
groupings in multiplication. 
Again, every combination studied in addition teaches 
the fact in subtraction which is its complement. Since 
5 and 2 are 7, 7 less 2 are 5, and 7 less five are 2; since 
8 and 7 are 15, 8 from 15 are 7, and 7 from 15 are 8. 
Then 7 from 25 are 18; 7 from 95 are 88, and so on. 
All the facts ever needed in subtraction should be_ 
taught before the child has completed the study of 20. 
The largest minuend ever used in subtraction is 18; 
the largest subtrahend is 9. . A little study will show 
what groups in subtraction will cover all the problems 
which the child needs to solve. These facts should be’ 
carefully presented, and repeated over and over until 
the results are absolutely memorized and the difference 
is stated as soon as the two numbers are compared. 
A careful study of the groups of numbers known 
as the multiplication tables, will indicate the combina- 
tions which are most difficult for the pupils, and upon 
which most time and effort must be spent. In the early 
lessons the teacher should make very plain to the chil- 
dren the fact that the multiplication is a short statement 
and method of addition, and should teach him to build 
for himself, through addition, the products learned in 
the multiplication tables; but having learned to build 
this combination, and to prove its accuracy, the child 
should memorize the result, so that the product is
-P-A-G-E-211
  
NUMBER. 211 
  suggested instantly when the factors are named. All 
teachers recognize the fact that a few combinations 
present more difficulties to the pupils than any others. 
8 times 7,9 times 6,9 times 7, 8 times 9, are among 
the number. The tens sing themselves through the 
memory of the children; so the elevens abide in the 
, memory through their rhythm. The fives are learned 
in the same way. The wise teacher appreciates this 
fact, and singles out the difficult combination for careful 
development and thoughtful drill. Often the child’s 
appreciation of the fact that these are difficult will 
whet his determination to master them. “Here is 
something hard to remember,” the teacher says; “ let 
us see if we cannot master it to-day,” and the combina- 
tion is built, is memorized, is applied in problems, and. 
each child goes to his seat from the recitation with the 
consciousness of a new possession. Such emphasis on 
the hard places would do away with much of the 
teacher’s repetition, which leaves no impression because 
it is so indifferently performed. 
With the groupings of the even numbers in mul- 
tiplication, should come the corresponding division. 
Since the 3 fours are 12, there must always be three 
fours in 12, or 4 threes in 12. One third of the 12 is 4; 
one fourth of the 12 is 3. These facts are but one, and 
should be learned as one. Again, in written multipli- 
cation and division, there is constant need of the power 
to hold in mind two results, — a product and sum in 
multiplication, a remainder and quotient in division. 
Thus in multiplying 25 by 6, the child must remember 
not only the 6 fives and the 6 twos, but the 6 twos 
plus 3. In dividing 150 by 6, he must not only remem- 
ber the 2 sixes in 12, but must compare 15 with the
-P-A-G-E-212
212 NUMBER. 
  nearest multiple of 12, holding in mind the product 
and the remainder left after subtracting this product. 
Hence his drill on the fundamental combinations should 
include drill in these double lines. He should add to 
the even products, and divide where there must be 
a remainder. Such drill will do away with much of 
the difficulty common in written multiplication and 
division. 
Added to these essential facts of numbers which 
underlie the four processes, must be the recognition 
eff concrete units, and knowledge of the terms which 
must be used in the simple processes. The child’s 
knowledge of these units, — as the foot, the yard, the - 
pint, the quart, etc., — must be gained in the first place 
through observation. In no other way can they be 
taught. It is not enough for the teacher to tell the 
child that three feet equal one yard. He will never — 
know it until he measures for himself, and so makes 
the truth his own. He must separate the unit into equal 
parts in order to know the fraction. He must see, 
use, and name, the factors, the product, the divisor, the 
dividend, in order to deal definitely and easily with 
' these terms and the ideas which they represent. These 
must be seen before being memorized by the child in 
his primary lessons. 
As soon as the child has mastered these lowest terms 
of his work, he need not be confined to illustration, or 
to objects of any sort. The mental picture takes the 
place of the tangible object. It is a mistake to tie 
-the child to splints or pegs after he has begun to grasp 
the real idea of number to which the use of the groups 
of objects should lead him. The teacher who has 
taught the child the combinations in numbers to 10 by 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  NUMBER. 213 
means of objects, should have tested in every number 
the child’s power to see the combinations without the 
objects. That should be the first step in presenting 
the new number. If he is taking 8 for the first time, 
let her discover how much he can tell her about 8 
from his knowledge of 7; and when she finds his idea 
is confused or dim, then let her bring the objects to 
the rescue. But not until then. If the child has in his 
mind the picture of the number, or if he can build this 
picture from what he knows of some other number, the 
material object is unnecessary. Use the object only 
when it is needed to make the number clearer to the 
child. Let him use it in order to prove to the teacher 
that his words express ideas, and that he understands 
their meaning, but do not hold to the form of using the 
objects when there is no need of their use. 
Many of the processes can be best taught by the 
judicious ‘use of objects. Subtraction, the carrying in 
addition, partition and division, reduction, should be 
‘ made clear and tangible to the child by concrete illus- 
tration ;“ but as soon as the child has recognized the 
truth that the illustration is intended to teach, the ob- 
ject should be done away with and he should depend 
upon the mental picture in his memory. 
The number lessons should teach clear analysis and 
definite statement. To this end the teacher herself should 
think clearly and state definitely. Often the teacher’s 
putting pointless and indefinite questions utterly pre- 
vents the child from thinking clearly. His mind is 
confused, befogged, because her thoughts are so vague. 
The teacher should develop in herself a power and 
habit of clear, logical, and definite questioning, and 
should demand from her pupils thoughtful answers to
-P-A-G-E-214
214 NUMBER, 
  
her questions. “How many are 7 fives, Johnnie? 
asks the teacher. “30,” Johnnie replies boldly; and 
the teacher kindly suggests, “ You thought I meant 6 
fives, did n’t you; Johnnie?” “Yes’m,” the boy wil- 
lingly assents. So she cultivates the child’s habit of 
listening to something like what she meant to say, in- 
stead of hearing the exact question and answering it 
exactly. She accepts what she thinks he means to 
say, instead of what he actually does say. No definite- 
ness of thought can come from such recitations. An 
equally fatal habit is that in which the teacher continu- 
ally prompts and suggests the answer, doing the work 
for the child, putting the words into his mouth, sug- 
gesting the form of statement, and completing the 
broken sentences. Under such tuition the child be- 
comes helpless, and his work is hopeless. The child 
should learn to think for himself, to speak for himself; 
his words should be interpreted as meaning just what 
he says and nothing more nor less. Such interpreta- 
tion will do much to help him to clear and healthful 
thinking. 
The object of the so-called analysis of problems is to 
lead the child to recognize the steps in his thinking and 
to clearly state these steps. The analysis should lead 
him to see the end which he attempts to reach, and to 
recognize the steps by which he attains it. Such think- 
ing gives added definiteness to his thought and clear- 
ness to his expression. 
The mechanical repetition of a form of analysis is of 
no value to the child. He must recognize clearly the 
conditions of the problem, and the process of solution 
which these conditions demand. His own statement
-P-A-G-E-215
NUMBER. 215 
  
will express what he himself sees much more truly than 
will the teacher’s words, while his willing acceptance 
of her formula makes her blind to his actual need. 
Until the child recognizes the exactness and beauty of 
the logical statement as it is phrased in the formula, 
let him hold to his own, working his way toward the 
clearer light. 
An illustration may show more plainly the line of 
work which is most helpful to the child. The following 
is suggestive : — 
A man paid $72.00 for a wagon and $8.00 for repairs, 
then sold it at a loss of $9.00; how much did he re- 
ceive for it? 
«What are you to find?” “Tam to find how much the 
man received for the wagon.” (Keep this end in view.) 
“What are you told to help you?” “What he paid for 
the wagon ($72), what the repairs cost ($8), and how 
much he lost ($9).” ‘‘ What must you learn?” ‘“ What 
the entire cost was.” ‘“ Howcan you learn that?” “By 
adding the first cost, $72, and the cost of repairs, $8, I 
find.the entire cost $80.” “ What further must you find?” 
“T must find the selling price.” ‘What have you to help 
you?” “T know that the selling price was $9 less than 
the entire cost.” “ How do you know that?” “Because 
he lost $9.” ‘“‘ How will you find the selling price?” “By 
subtracting $9 from the entire cost, $80. The differ- 
ence is $71, therefore he sold the wagon for $71.00.” 
Thus far the teacher and child have worked together, 
the teacher directing the thinking. The work is not 
complete until the child can solve the problem alone, 
and further state and solve all similar problems. His 
independent solution should be something like this: — 
I am required to find the selling price of the wagon.
-P-A-G-E-216
216 NUMBER. 
  
I know that the entire cost of the wagon was $72 plus 
$8, or $80. I also know that the selling price is $g 
less than the entire cost. The selling price must be 
$9 less than $80, or $71.00. 
The written explanation should be something like 
the following : — 
Required: The selling price of the wagon. 
Known: The first cost, $72, the cost of repairs, $8, 
and that the sum of these is $9 more than the selling 
price. 
$72 plus $8 equals $80, entire cost. 
$80 minus $9 “ $71, selling price. 
The child comes so slowly to the power to think 
consecutively and to state his thoughts accurately that 
we are often tempted to put the words into his mouth 
in order to hurry the desired result. But we do not 
hasten it by our impatience. We deter it. The child 
merely accepts our words; he does not think. And 
he fails to get out of the exercise any help toward 
thinking the next time. The best help which the 
teacher can give is to question definitely, logically, pa- 
tiently, over and over, until the child recognizes the 
relation of the question and the need of the steps in 
the process. After he comprehends the conditions of 
the problem he should solve many others until his 
power is assured. But his power is complete, not when 
he can solve the problems classified as being alike, but 
only when he can recognize and read the conditions, 
wherever and however stated. Then the formula will 
not hurt him, for he recognizes the general truth; but 
then he does not need the formal expression, for he 
has become able to state the truth for himself.

In these few pages no summary of the facts of number 
can be given, nor of the processes involved in number 
work; but the aim has been to indicate a few of the 
leading and essential characteristics of good teaching as 
applied to number. These methods may be carried out 
in manifold ways, varied by the teacher’s personality 
and skill, but the principles of the work abide the same. 
We may test our power to teach number by our pupil’s 
ability to think /clearly, to state definitely, to grasp new 
conditions, and by his absolute possession of the funda- 
mental facts of number. ’

SEAT WORK. 
I. PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. 
F we were to count the number of hours which the 
ordinary pupil spends in recitation during his school 
course, and the number of hours given to work at his 
desk, we should find that the latter is by far the greater 
part of his school life; and if this is true it ought to 
follow that the teacher’s thought and care should be 
proportionately distributed between the class instruction 
and recitation and the occupation which fills the other 
periods. During these hours of “ busy work,” as they 
are called in the primary schools, the child ought to be 
fixing the facts and truths learned in the period of 
instruction, adding to the knowledge already gained, 
developing power in the lines in which he is working, 
and strengthening right habits of study. Too often the 
teacher’s chief purpose in assigning the busy work is to 
keep the child quiet until the period of his next recita- 
- tion. Too often she fails to give the needed thought to 
the preparation of this important part of his work and 
hers. The direction for his occupation at his desk is 
given on the spur of the moment, often after the class 
is called for recitation. The occupation has no relation 
to the work that has gone before or that is to follow. 
The materials are not provided, directions are not defi- 
nitely given; and the immediate result is a deluge of
-P-A-G-E-219
PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. 219 
  
questions as to the work and the manner in which it is 
to be performed. Disorder and dissatisfaction result 
from such thoughtless ruling; but more serious still is 
the habit of indifference and inattention and of disorder 
that results from the long hours spent in profitless occu- 
pation, or in mischief which its assumed author is sup- 
posed to find for idle hands to do. Many a teacher 
might trace the indifference, inattention, and disorder of 
her school to this source. A child who is profitably 
occupied has few opportunities to disturb his neighbor ; 
certainly his inclination to do so is diverted by the work 
in which he is interested. But the immediate difficulty 
in discipline is not commensurate with the hidden but 
fatal habits which are surely fixed in these profitless 
hours, and the loss of the knowledge to which the work 
of these hours should have led. 
Every teacher feels it incumbent upon her to prepare 
a programme of daily recitations in order to facilitate 
her work. Without such an arrangement her work 
would be chaotic. She must have some order of pro- 
cedure, and must adhere to that order. Through this 
arrangement the school work comes to move steadily 
and evenly toward the desired results. Such a pro- 
gramme is quite as necessary for the seat work. The 
children should know not only the time of the recitation 
period, but the work to be allotted in the study period. 
They should know the purpose of that work, and should 
direct all their energies to accomplish that purpose 
just as truly as in the recitation period. The best pro- 
grammes show to the pupil the work for every period 
of the school day, including the seat work, and to the 
arrangement of this occupation the teacher should give 
her most careful attention.
-P-A-G-E-220
  
  220 SEAT WORK. 
  The seat work should be related to the other lessons 
of the day. Too much time is spent in isolated work. 
There is a tendency in many schools to treat each exer- 
cise as if it were a unit by itself, with no relation to any 
other exercise. Through such isolation each exercise 
is shorn of its strength. No truth is complete without 
the truths related to it; no exercise is complete without 
the others which should be associated with it. Every 
step in arithmetic, for instance, depends on that which 
has gone before, and prepares the way for that which is 
to come; and the teacher who appreciates the relation 
of each part to the whole will teach most clearly and 
definitely and with the greatest economy of energy. 
There is no time to waste in the schoolroom. Every 
lesson should count in attaining a few certain great 
results, and every lesson assigned for study should have 
its place in the chain of lessons which leaves the child 
with a certain fund of useful knowledge, or certain 
powers and habits through which he can acquire such 
knowledge for himself. The lesson assigned for seat 
work should either afford the child an opportunity to 
gain new knowledge, or through varied repetition it 
should fix knowledge already presented, or its purpose 
should be to fix habits which can become assured only 
through the exercise thus presented. 
To this end the teacher should have in mind just what 
she desires the children to do, just why, and just how to 
do it. She should be prepared with all the material 
necessary for the work, — pencils well sharpened and of 
suitable length, paper of proper size, ink free from sedi- 
ment, pens clean and flexible, illustrations for the board 
work, needles and worsteds for the sewing, — everything, 
in short, which is needed for the work which she has
-P-A-G-E-221
  PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. 221 
  
chosen. Further, she should prepare as well definite 
directions for the work. A multitude of questions that 
arise from the pupil’s uncertainty is thus prevented, and 
the definite purpose of his work is assured. These 
directions should be clear and concise, and should be 
stated but once, clearly and concisely. Having the 
materials and understanding the directions, the children 
should lose no time in getting to work. The period 
should be a period of work, and not of listless dawdling. 
To insure this, the work should be suited to the capa- 
city of the children, and should provide occupation for 
the entire period. A question always arises here. Some 
pupils work much more rapidly than others, and will 
have their task completed when the others have hardly 
begun. To lengthen the task assigned to the entire 
class would discourage the slower ones. The only course 
which the teacher can adopt is to provide additional 
work for the quicker pupils, — books to read, or further 
work in the same line to be done. This provision should 
be made in order to prevent the brighter pupils from 
spending a part of the period in idleness and its at- 
tendant mischief. 
Another ounce of prevention is stored in the proper 
distribution of materials. A little system in this matter 
prevents much confusion at the time of beginning the 
work. In the primary schoolroom as well as in the 
higher grades, the different children may help the teacher 
in this work and so help themselves to habits of order 
and system. It is well to spend some time in the begin- 
ning of the term in teaching the children how to distrib- 
ute and collect material. The order should always be 
the same, in order that the process may be quickly fin- 
ished and the work of the schoolroom may be disturbed
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 SEAT WORK. 
  
as little as possible. If cards are to be distributed they 
should be fastened in neat packages. The pencils should 
be kept in uniform boxes or on cards to which bands have 
been fastened through which the pencils may be inserted. 
The writing-books, the tablets, the pegs, the sewing 
material, should be distributed and collected in a cer- 
tain order, if not with certain signals. The time spent 
in teaching this order in the first days of the term will 
be gained many times over in the added facility which 
results from this drill. 
The work should be varied from day to day, especially 
in the lower grades. Variety helps to hold the interest 
of the pupils and so their attention, but though materials 
may differ, the purpose should be the same, and the 
materials in every case should be adapted to securing 
the one result. 
The material should not only be varied from hour to 
hour, but also from week to week. The wise mother 
puts away some of the playthings of her children, to 
bring them out after a few weeks of absence, when they 
have all the charm of-a new toy. The same princi- 
ple operates in the schoolroom. In order to prevent 
monotony in the assignment of desk work and to insure 
profitable work, the teacher who is attempting this plan 
for the first time might well keep a note-book in which her 
programmes are written. Devices which are suggested 
by her reading, or by experience of her teacher friends, 
or by her own failures and successes in the schoolroom, © 
should be chronicled therein, and with them a record of 
the work assigned from day to day. This record will 
help her to vary the programme and so hold the in- 
terest of the children. 
The child should be taught how to do the work at
-P-A-G-E-223
  PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. 223 
his desk just as he is taught how to solve the problem 
in the class or to use new material in drawing or science. 
This is especially true of little children. They should 
be taught how to handle the materials placed before 
them, the pegs, the splints, the worsteds, the sewing, 
the weaving. In written work they should be carefully 
taught the best arrangement of their work, and should 
be urged to make every exercise better than the pre- 
ceding one. Such instruction when new work is 
presented, helps the child to make the best use of the 
materials placed in his hands. 
A word as to the correction and supervision of seat 
work. How often the teacher, in the hurry and pressure 
of the day, calls a new class and says to the pupils who 
have been employed at their desks, “ Clean your slates 
and write this new exercise,” without a glance to see 
what work is to be erased from the slates at her bidding. 
The children have been toiling for half an hour per- 
haps, writing sentences, drawing illustrations, or copy- 
ing words, and these are effaced with one movement of 
the sponge, with nobody to see that they have ever been 
written. What wonder that the child becomes careless 
and indifferent, that his writing is poor, his words are 
ill-spelled, that his drawing is indifferent, that pictures 
which his fancy pencils take the place of the work 
directed by the teacher. We would become indifferent 
and careless under the same circumstances. No teacher 
can afford to deprive herself and the children of the few 
moments needed for quick and clear-sighted supervision 
of the work. ‘But I have no time,” cries the over- 
burdened teacher. The truth is that the few minutes 
saved to spend upon the recitation of a part. of the 
pupils, results in far less advantage to them than would  
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 SEAT WORK. 
the same time given to the supervision of the work at 
the desk, for through the teacher’s approval or criticism 
and through the knowledge that all the work will come 
under her eye, does the child acquire new earnestness 
and interest in his work and a habit of careful working. 
These are worth more to him than the knowledge he 
might gain in the time given to this direction on the 
part of the teacher. 
This direction need not be detailed and minute. 
Passing rapidly through the aisle, the teacher glances 
from one desk to another; her practised eye sees at 
once that Johnnie has worked faithfully and well, that 
James has copied carelessly, that Susie has done better 
than yesterday, that Kate is untidy and careless; the 
word to the one and look at the other, a neat slate 
lifted before the class, a sign of approval worthily or 
truly won, a word that tells the school that the teacher 
is satisfied with the effort made, — these take but little 
time, but they achieve most important results. For 
such a prize the children will work diligently and faith- 
fully, and in the working will learn habits of untold 
value to themselves. In this examination of the work 
the teacher should use great care in both commenda- 
tion and reproof. Her word of approval will deter- 
mine the line in which the children will work. If she 
commends neatness of arrangement they will work for 
that. If she commends rapidity, they will strive for 
that. If she singles out one slate as the “ best in the 
room,” that honor will be the one desired. It is most 
important, therefore, that she should approve the quali- 
ties that she desires the children to gain. Her com- 
ment should never be, “ Michael has done better than 
Timothy,” or “John’s slate is the best in the class.”
-P-A-G-E-225
  
» PURPOSE AND DIRECTION. 225 
Michael should be compared with himself and what he 
did yesterday. John’s work should be measured in 
the same way. ‘All the class have done their best,” 
should be the most welcome reward which she could 
bestow. The teacher should encourage in the children 
the delight in good work, whoever accomplishes it. The 
spirit of rejoicing in the successes of another, and the 
determination to outgrow the work and power of yes- 
terday — the spirit of her criticism and the words in 
which she phrases it will do much to determine this 
ideal on the part of the children. She should approve 
neatness, endeavor, spirit of the work, obedience to in- 
structions. The work that covers pages but is illegible, 
the work which is acknowledged to be less than the 
child’s best, the work which was done unwillingly or 
carelessly, the work which does not fulfil the teacher’s 
instructions, should never be commended; but the child 
who tries to do just what he is told to do, loyally, faith- 
fully, as well as he knows how, should be approved 
even if but one sentence out of ten is complete or the 
entire page is undecipherable. Quantity should be the 
last item to win praise. Accuracy and adherence to the 
ideal should be praised before despatch. The work 
should be done as rapidly as possible, but it should 
first be well done. 
In assigning seat work, the teacher should be sure 
that the work can be completed in the given time, with 
reasonable diligence. If she assigns work that can 
never be completed by the children, so that every day the 
unfinished results must be accepted, they will naturally 
become indifferent. ‘“ Write all you can about China,” 
is a subject for an afternoon, not for fifteen minutes. It 
would be better to give a few definite directions instead, 
15
-P-A-G-E-226
ON ee 
226 SEAT WORK. 
  
outlining work which the pupil can complete. This 
habit of finishing the work is one worth gaining. 
The desk work of which we have been speaking has 
included written work, or that involving the use of 
materials alone, but the child must form right habits 
of study, must learn to get thought from books; and 
part of the time spent at the desks in early school life 
should be spent in learning how to study. It is a mis- 
take to put the book into the hands of the child with 
the direction to study the lesson, when he has not 
learned what study means. He should be taught how 
to get the thought from sentences, and must be directed 
first to define that which he is to get. Before asking 
the children to study the reading lesson they should 
be taught to get certain facts from it,— not, ‘“ Read 
the lesson ten times,” as is the common direction, but, 
“Learn where John went. Find out who he was. Tell 
me what he found, and what he brought home. Write 
down all that John did. Write everything that Kate said. 
Write all that you learn about the horse, the farm, the 
house,” etc. These directions may be increased until 
the child learns to study without them, mastering for 
himself the fact expressed on the printed page. 
II. SUGGESTIONS FOR SEAT WORK. 
I. Related to Reading. 
1. For word study in Primary classes write lists of 
words which will rhyme with the one used as pattern 
upon the board, as “sing,” “ block,” “when,” “ track.” 
Instead of writing the words upon the board the teacher 
may use cards upon which the type words have been 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  
SUGGESTIONS FOR SEATWORK. 227 
  
written. In all such exercises, insist upon neatness of 
execution. The words should be written in columns, 
with an even margin. 
2. Provide each child with an envelope or a small 
pasteboard box. As new words are developed in the 
period of word study, write these words upon small 
pieces of paper or card, and give them to each child to 
keep in his envelope or box. He will thus be provided 
with a vocabulary for which he is responsible. This can 
be used in various ways. With his words he can make 
some sentence chosen from the reading lesson, and 
then may copy it upon slate or paper. He can make 
lists of words beginning with a certain letter, or lists con- 
taining a certain letter. He can select words which are 
names of objects, and draw pictures to illustrate them. 
3. Cut paragraphs from old readers or newspapers. 
Provide the children with pencils and paragraphs, and 
require them to draw a line under all words which they 
recognize, and then to copy these words in columns to 
be read to the class later. 
4. Procure sheets of cardboard containing the letters 
of the alphabet. These may be bought at any school- 
supply company or prepared by a printer in the neigh- 
borhood at slight cost. Place the letters in boxes or 
envelopes. It may be well to number the letters 
belonging in each box so that the child may easily 
retain his share. With these letters he may reproduce 
lists of words or sentences from the blackboard or 
Reader. It is better in using this material to require the 
child to copy some definite form rather than to allow 
him to make what sentence he pleases. He will thus 
work to some definite end. 
5. In the transition from script to print, use pages of
-P-A-G-E-228
} 228 SEAT WORK. 
  
an old reader which have been pasted upon cardboard 
or manilla paper in order to make them stiff enough to 
endure handling. Cut them into words or sentences ; 
write copies of the same story, mounted in the same 
way and cut, placing both script and print in the same 
envelope; require the child to build the sentences with 
both script and print. 
6. Prepare cards containing drawings or pictures of 
common objects, as box, ball, top, fan, and require the 
child to copy the pictures, writing the word underneath. 
7. Write sentences which may easily be pictured, as 
The ball is on the table; There are two eggs in the nest; 
The bird is on the bough; The tree grows by the brook; 
I have two hands; John has a toy balloon. Require 
the children to copy the sentence and to express the 
thought by picture. 
8. Read a short story or poem to the children and ask 
them to picture the scenes which the poem describes. 
“The Envious Wren,” a short poem found among those 
of the Cary sisters, is well suited to such reproduction. 
So is the story of “Little Bell.” Some of the scenes 
described in the Memory Gems may be thus pictured. 
Such exercises strengthen as well as test the power of 
imagination. Illustrations of such work will be appended 
to this chapter. 
g. Copy sentences from the reading lesson. In such 
copying, insist upon neat writing, careful placing of cap- 
itals and punctuation marks, and look to see that each 
succeeding line is better than its predecessor. 
10. Write lists of words upon the board, selecting 
those needed in language, reading, or general lessons, 
and require the child to use them in sentences. These 
sentences should invariably mean something. Not, I 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  SUGGESTIONS FOR SEAT WORK. 229 
  
see a cat, but, A cat has sharp claws. Not, This is a 
primrose, but, Our primrose has blossomed. 
11. Select from acertain lesson in the Reader and 
copy words of one syllable, words of two syllables, etc. 
12. Write lists of words containing the same syllable, 
or derived from the same word, as cal/, calling, called, 
caller, etc. Write upon the board questions which out- 
line the story of the reading lesson, as Who was John? 
Where did he go? What did he do? What did he 
learn from this? And require the child after reading, 
to write the story in answer to the questions, making 
paragraphs in accordance with the topics suggested by 
the questions, 
13. Copy sentences from the reading lesson, substi- 
tuting synonyms for words which the teacher underlines. 
14. Use appropriate adjectives to describe nouns which 
have been selected ; as, Iron is hard, Glass is brittle, etc. 
These words need not be known as adjectives and nouns. 
Very young children may do this work. 
15. Reproduce the story of the lesson if not too long 
to be completed in the time allowed for the exercise. 
16. Memorize and write from memory a stanza or par- 
agraph which is worth committing to memory. 
II. Seat Work related to Number. 
1. Use pegs, corn, beans, melon-seeds, buttons, or 
wooden toothpicks. Provide a bag or box for each 
child in which these may be kept for use as counters. 
Use them in illustrating the combinations and separa- 
tions taught. 
2. Make dominos of cardboard, leaving the sides 
blank. Let the child complete the number studied with 
buttons, beans, or lentils.
-P-A-G-E-230
    230 SEAT WORK. 
    
3. Paste calendars upon sheets of manilla paper or 
cardboard in order to make them stiff, cut into squares 
containing the figures, let the children place the numbers 
in order, or place groups of objects upon one side of the 
domino and the corresponding figure upon the other. 
4. Have figures printed upon cardboard in quanti- 
ties. These may be obtained of the same source as 
were the alphabet cards. Use them for illustrating 
problems which the teacher places upon the board. 
These should not be needed beyond the first year of 
school. 
5. Picture the conditions indicated by the problem. 
See that the picturing represents the exact condition 
stated. Five birds were upon a tree, and two flew away ; 
how many were left? In this picture the first scene 
should represent the first grouping, the five birds upon 
the tree; the second picture should represent the three 
left upon the tree, with the two flying away. Such pic- 
turing ought to lead to power to imagine the conditions 
of problems. It is lack of this power which often keeps 
the child from solving his problem. The teacher should 
be sure that the child understands the conditions which 
demand certain steps in the solution of the problem. 
Too often he adds, subtracts, multiplies, or divides sim- 
ply because he is told, without any perception of the 
reason for the process. The picturing should express 
the thought accurately. In the problem Mary has 
three cents and John has five; how many more cents 
has John than Mary? the three cents and five cents 
should be placed side by side, plainly showing that John 
has two cents more than Mary. In the problem, John 
had five cents and gave Mary three; how many had he 
left ? the five cents should be represented first, and the
-P-A-G-E-231
  SUGGESTIONS FOR SEAT WORK. 231 
three which John gave Mary out of the five should be 
cut off, showing the two that are left. 
6. Find in the garret or buy at a second-hand book 
store copies of old arithmetics, cut from the pages 
problems suitable for the class, paste upon the backs of 
cards, and distribute to those pupils who finish their 
work before the others. 
7. For little children cut different-colored worsteds 
into short lengths, ask them to assort the colors, placing 
a certain number of threads in each group. 
8. Supply the children with paper and scissors; let 
them cut the paper into equal lengths and make into 
chains, using a required number of links of each color. 
These chains can be used afterward for decorating the 
room, making sash curtains, etc. 
g. Provide beads or buttons for the children to string, 
requiring them to use a certain number in each group. 
In such exercises it is better for the child to separate 
the beads or buttons into the required groups before 
beginning to string, to prevent too continued counting 
by ones. The Kindergarten beads made in the form 
of cubes, spheres,’ and cylinders are useful but more 
expensive. 
10. Cut from paper or cardboard circles of the size 
of a five-cent piece; upon these place groups of dots 
or stars, let the child assort the circles, placing together 
those which have the same number of dots. 
11. Cut squares of oilcloth or of leather into half- 
inch strips, leaving an uncut margin of a half-inch at 
both ends. Let the children use colored splints and 
weave a required pattern. This will emphasize number, 
color, and arrangement. 
12. Provide cards having upon them pictures of
-P-A-G-E-232
    232 SEAT WORK. 
  groups of objects, and require the children to make 
problems which the numbers of objects suggest. 
13. Copy and complete domino cards, especially with 
numbers that make ten. 
14. Construct, draw, and cut oblongs having given 
measurements; use the square inch as a unit. Measure 
objects in the room and write statements of the result. 
15. Draw and cut circles and squares, and fold them 
into fractional parts. Show the fractional parts of 
groups of numbers, 
16. Construct a dial for marking time, placing the 
hands to denote a given hour. 
17. Use wooden toothpicks, fasten bundles of pens 
with rubber bands in teaching first steps in addition and 
subtraction; illustrate the results. 
18. Prepare cards containing equations showing the 
combinations and separations of numbers which the 
child has studied. Omit some part of the equation; 
require the child to complete, and to state also in the 
ordinary form required in the four processes. This 
form is better for constant use because it is the one 
which is repeated in all his later work. 
19. Write the analysis of problems in order to lead 
to more distinct perception of the steps. Do not demand 
acertain formula, but rather a clear statement of the 
process. 
III. Seat Work requiring observation of form and 
color. 
1. Cut cardboard into different forms: circles, squares, 
triangles, etc. Ask the children to match those which are 
exactly alike; then to select all squares, all circles, etc. 
2. Provide small squares of thin manilla paper. Make
-P-A-G-E-233
SUGGESTIONS FOR SEAT WORK. 233 
  the impression of a circle or square by means of a 
spool, cylinder, or tube; cut the forms from the impres- 
sion; arrange and paste. 
3. Represent upon the blackboard. Make paper 
chains, such as were suggested in number work. 
4. Represent upon the blackboard a slate with va- 
rious objects grouped upon it. Ask the children to repro- 
duce, showing accurately the number and position of the 
objects. It is interesting to require this when the pupils 
first enter school, and to repeat the exercise a month 
later, comparing results. The later results will, without 
doubt, show marked growth in the power of observa- 
tion. Remember that this power helps the child to 
learn to read. 
5. Assort the letters or figures with which the children 
have been provided; put together words that are alike. 
6. Make a large chart of manilla paper, drawing upon 
it with a rubber pen forms which the children may copy 
with pegs, splints, lentils, or in drawing. These forms 
should be simple, and should be related to the drawing 
lessons or nature study. The chart may, of course, 
consist of any number of leaves. 
7. Cut circles, squares, etc., from colored paper; 
arrange in designs for borders or rosettes, and draw. 
8. Provide material for sewing the outline of forms 
studied in drawing, groups used in number lessons, or 
objects described in the nature study. Stout manilla 
tag-board may be procured at slight expense for this 
purpose. Many school-supply companies provide out- 
lines dotted for sewing. The cards can be made by the 
teacher, however, by the use of a hectograph. The pat- 
terns thus arranged will be more closely related to the 
work of her own classes. Use chenille needles, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 SEAT WORK. 
  
the children can easily thread, and split zephyr worsted 
of appropriate colors. The writer has seen children 
supplied with such material at a total expense of three 
cents each for the term, After a little practice the 
children will be skilful enough to thread their own 
needles, match the colors, and to make nearly all the 
needed preparation for themselves. The sewing may 
then be profitably used when the little hands are tired 
with writing and the teacher is occupied with other 
classes. The patterns selected should be those which 
suggest some thought in the other lesson, —the sun, 
moon, stars, windmills, and boats; snowflakes when 
the children are observing natural forces; the horse- 
shoe when they study “The Village Blacksmith;” the 
Esquimau hut, sled, and impiements, or the bow and 
arrow, wigwam and canoe of the Indian when these 
people furnish the theme of the general lesson. Out- 
lines of leaves, blossoms, and fruits should accompany 
the plant lessons. 
If the outlines are neatly sewed the card should be 
made into some article of use; a book-cover, an en- 
velope for holding papers, a book-mark, a court-plaster 
case, napkin-ring, pin-tray, and basket are among the 
many articles which the children can easily fashion. 
9. Modelling in clay and sand is a most helpful 
means of strengthening and testing the power to see 
form. A table with the rim raised two or three inches 
and filled with clean sand will afford hours of profitable 
work for the little ones. The forms they. have studied 
may be modelled here, — the village street, the meadow, 
the brook, the Esquimau hut, the cave of the winds, the 
sand-rimmed pickerel-pond. The plastic clay may be 
used at the desk; provide oilcloth mats upon which the
-P-A-G-E-235
SUGGESTIONS FOR SEAT WORK. 235 
  
children may work. Let them model, not only the 
geometric forms, but also the natural objects which 
they study, — the apple, the peach, the pear, the plum, 
as well as the ball and the box. The attempt to ex- 
press in a visible form what the child has in his mind 
leads to closer attention to form, and results in a more 
definite mental picture. The power to use materials 
leads to a feeling of independence. All work in con- 
struction is valuable for these reasons. 
IV. Seat Work for older Classes. 
As the children become more accustomed to study 
of books, they need less varied material for expression 
and are able to endure longer periods of work in the 
same lines. The seat work for these classes will be 
chiefly confined to study of books, writing, drawing, 
and arithmetic. Reproduction of the history, geog- 
raphy, and arithmetic, drawing maps of designs and 
illustrations of the thought expressed in the reading 
or general lessons will afford all necessary practice and 
sufficient variety. To these may be added the sewing 
and sloyd, and the drawing associated with them. Great 
care should be taken to link this seat work to the va- 
rious lessons of the day, making it afford practice in 
the lines where the child most needs drill, and demand- 
ing the exercise of his different powers. The repro- 
duction of the history lesson, for instance, may be in 
the form of simple narration or in letter form, or the 
child may imagine himself as the chief actor in the 
scenes which he describes. The description of the 
plant may be written in full or represented by drawing. 
The map as well as the description and letter should 
record what the child learns in geography. Do not
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 “SEAT WORK. 
forget to allow some period for silent reading, in which 
the child learns for himself what books have to give, 
and prepares to tell others what he learns. 
In all work at the seats, insist upon attention and 
diligence, with no waste of materials or of time, 
prompt action without dawdling, and independent work 
without copying or interference with one’s neighbors. 
Make every lesson tell in right habits of work.
-P-A-G-E-237
  VIII. 
TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
I. MOODS AND MANNERS. 
1 may be worth while to leave for a moment the dis- 
cussion of methods and principles, in which our 
teachers are doubtless well versed, in order to think of 
other factors which enter into school work. Among 
these are the moods and manner of the teacher. Though 
they cannot be easily classified, nor defined, nor culti- 
vated according to set rules, nor modified by the most 
careful prescriptions, yet they have much to do with 
the happiness and progress of the pupils, as well as 
with the teacher’s success. A knowledge of their 
“whys and wherefores” is as essential as the study of 
subject-matter, or command of devices to illustrate the 
facts taught. The way in which we say a thing is often 
more potent than the thing we say. We all know 
people whose manner wins for them scores of friends, 
and others for whom their nearest friends need con- 
stantly to make the excuse, ‘Oh, you must n’t mind 
what she says. She means it kindly. It is her way.” 
Strange that these unfortunate “ways” are so common 
that we forget to use the expression in speaking of 
manners that are kindly, or thoughtful, or courteous. 
These “ways” bear the same fruit in the school- 
room that we find in the outside harvest. Some 
teachers arouse all the combativeness in a child’s na-
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
ture by the tones or gestures employed in the slightest 
command. There is a “ Do this” which arouses every 
fibre in the boy to say, “I won't!” There is a “Do 
this” that causes him to bend every energy to the 
willing accomplishment of the teacher’s purpose; there 
is still a third, which leaves him in utter indifference, 
and which might as well—yes, might better — have 
been left unsaid. The commands — rather, the words 
of the commands—are the same; the results are 
very different because the teachers’ ways are different. 
There is the manner which repels and represses; 
there is the opposite which wins and attracts. There is 
a noisy, boisterous manner, which is often misnamed, 
the hurry and flurry being mistaken for enthusiasm. 
A school will be stirred and excited by such a manner, 
but never strengthened. There is a serene, even bear- 
ing, which implies reserved strength, which is cheerful 
while it is dignified, which inspires a true enthusiasm in 
aschool, There is an assumption of command which 
is weak; there is a kind of request which always implies 
obedience. And all that the manner implies, the chil- 
dren feel. ‘“ Actions,” the old proverb tells us, “ speak 
louder than words.” 
Nor should we disregard the little tricks of manner 
which pass so easily into habits. Snapping the fingers, 
pointing, tapping the pencil, saying “ Quietly!” with 
every movement of the class, asking automatically for 
attention, appending “Yes, go on,” to every fragmen- 
tary statement which the pupil makes, adopting the 
“‘schoolroom tone,” acquiring the questioning “ Yes?” 
—all these, with their kindred, are flaws which we 
should be glad to miss. 
The teacher’s manner, as first illustrated, is usually
-P-A-G-E-239
MOODS AND MANNERS. 239 
  persistent. There is a manner which varies with the 
mood. Bright and sunny one day, perhaps because of 
special rest or unusual health, the teacher inspires her 
class, and all goes well. Hurt, sad, or depressed some 
other day, from causes outside the schoolroom, she 
shares her depression with the pupils, and all goes 
wrong. She is happy, and the children sing, mistakes 
seem trivial, faults are lightly reproved. Her head aches, 
and she is weary; the classes are dull, errors abound 
and are inexcusable, and offences are severely punished. 
Her spirits are buoyant, and the work goes on wings; 
she is heavy-hearted, and the school is a dead weight. 
What then? Surely the schools, and all the boys 
and girls in them, are happily or wofully affected by 
something in the teacher, shown by her manner, or 
“way.” If the power is for good, we all would win it; 
if for ill, we all would shun it. Is this something that 
we can learn? 
It must be. We should be ashamed to confess that 
we had so little power of self-control that we could not 
overcome any defect known to be a defect, nor grow 
toward a good recognized as a good. If there is some- 
thing in our manner which hinders our pupils and 
retards our work, we can at least try to banish it. If 
our moods shadow the bright faces of our pupils, and 
lead us to pronounce unjust decrees, we can control 
our moods. The responsibility once acknowledged, 
we cannot be released from it. The weakness being 
known, we must improve. The better way being 
shown, we must walk in it. 
But how can we overcome that which seems almost 
irradicable, it has so become a part of us? By know- 
ing our faults, first. Some of us are blessed with friends

240 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  “made open-eyed to all our faults.” They may be the 
power that will — 
“the giftie gie us 
To see oursels as ithers see us.” 
Some of us know without the telling, having a true 
inner sense to be relied upon in such matters. But 
beyond this, we must study and try to realize a high 
ideal of a manner that is reposeful, serene, and womanly. 
Let it be the expression of a true, gentle, womanly 
spirit. The purpose to give our truest service to the 
children will help us to control the moods which would 
hinder that service. With right ideals, honest purpose, 
and patient effort, we must grow. 
II. FOR MONDAY MORNINGS. 
So many exercises in language, so many lessons in 
seading, so many “cases” in arithmetic, so many maps 
im geography, and so many words to spell, p/us the 
human body lessons, p/ws the general lessons, p/us the 
writing, drawing, music, and gymnastics! The school 
programme is full. We look from Monday morning 
across into Friday afternoon, draw a long breath, and 
wonder if we can teach in five school-days the week’s 
appointed fraction of all that the course of study 
requires. The desired results are so many, and the 
minutes are so few! 
And yet the course of study chronicles only a small 
part of the responsibility that rests upon us. We are 
to teach reading, language, and arithmetic, to be sure; 
but, teaching them, are to lead the children to some- 
thing better worth the knowing than any of the three. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  FOR MONDAY MORNINGS. 241 
  
The lessons in addition and subtraction must help to 
something higher, or they may as well never be taught. 
An old lady once told me that her mother would not 
allow her children to learn to write, because she knew 
of great harm that came once through an untruth’s 
being written. Though the prohibition seems on the 
face of it unwarrantable, careful thought will discover 
in it a germ of good sense. Unless the children could 
be taught what to write, they might as well not write 
at all. Unless our school work results in more than the 
course of study seems to suggest, much of our teaching 
will have been in vain. 
What more? Such habits of thought, of feeling, and 
of choice, as shall tend to right living; high ideals and 
earnest purposes, as well as the knowledge of processes 
and the power to solve problems. Through wise teach- 
ing, and by force of good example, these ideals are 
fixed, these purposes developed, these habits strength- 
ened. And because they are relatively of so great 
importance, it is wise to steal (or take) enough time 
from the regular programme of school affairs to give to 
work bearing directly upon these results. If all our 
teaching tends to strengthen the habits of honest work, 
can a talk about honesty be out of place? If our aim 
is to help our boys and girls to be upright and truthful, 
will not a sincere expression of our own ideal help in 
some measure? Can we not afford to speak occasion- 
ally of that which is greatest, when we have so many 
words to spare for that which is least? Then why 
not add to our programme a few minutes which shall 
be definitely given to moral teaching, in which: the 
attention of the children may be called to the qualities 
which enter into useful lives? And why not take this

  time on Monday morning, so that the week may begin 
with a good thought and a right motive? 
A paragraph from a newspaper, a fragment from a 
life-story, a schoolroom incident, a few lines of poetry, 
may furnish the theme. A short talk is better than a 
long one; a talk with the pupils far better than a 
talk at them. Earnestness will make amends for lack 
of eloquence. A direct application of the truth taught 
may be made in. the every-day schoolroom work. The 
“ preaching ” will be effective if it goes hand in hand 
with the practice. 
A good illustration for such lessons is one whose 
theme was the story of the drawbridge keeper, which 
has been told as follows: — 
“ History and poetry celebrate no sublimer act of devotion 
than that of Albert G. Drecker, the watchman of the Passaic 
River drawbridge, on the New York and Newark Railroad. 
The train was due, and he was closing the draw, when his little 
child fell into the deep water. It would have been easy enough 
to rescue him, if the father could have taken the time, but 
already the thundering train was at hand. It was a cruel agony. 
His child could be saved only by the cost of other lives com- 
mitted to his care. The brave man did his duty, but the child 
was drowned. The pass at Thermopyle was not more heroic- 
ally kept. Sir Philip Sidney, giving the cup of cold water to 
the dying soldier, is not a nobler figure than that of Albert G. 
Drecker, keeper of the Passaic Bridge.” 
The story is also told in verse: — 
“ Drecker, the drawbridge keeper, opened wide 
The dangerous gate to let the vessel through; 
His little son was standing by his side 
Above Passaic River, deep and blue, 
While in the distance, like a moan of pain, 
Was heard the whistle of the coming train,
-P-A-G-E-243
  FOR MONDAY MORNINGS. 243 
  
“ At once brave Drecker worked to swing it back, 
The gate-like bridge, that seemed a gate of death; 
Nearer and nearer, on the slender track, 
Came the swift engine, puffing its white breath ; 
Then, with a shriek, the loving father saw 
His darling boy fall headlong from the draw. 
“Either at once down in the stream to spring 
And save his son, and let the living freight 
Rush on to death, or to his work to cling 
And leave the boy unhelped to meet his fate; 
Which should he do? Were you, as he was, tried, 
Would not your love outweigh all else beside? 
“ But Drecker, being great of soul and true, 
Held to his work and did not aid his boy, 
Who in the deep, dark water sank from view; 
Then from the father’s life went forth all joy, 
But as he fell back, pallid with his pain, 
Across the bridge, in safety, passed the train. 
“He is most noble whose humanity 
Is least corrupted. To be just and good 
The birthright of the lowest born may be. 
Say what we can, we are one brotherhood, 
And rich or poor, or famous or unknown, 
True hearts are noble, and true hearts alone.” 
The story was told to the children. (Story telling 
is much more effective than story reading, in such 
lessons.) Their interest was aroused at once, for the 
story appealed to the best of their natures; and further- 
more, it was true. Under the teacher’s wise direction 
they discussed the story, described the drawbridge, 
outlined the duties of the keeper, talked of the trust 
reposed in him, and the promise tacitly made when he 
accepted his work. It was easy to lead them to see
-P-A-G-E-244
  244 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
that faithfulness to his trust, when the cost was so great, 
could only come out of constant loyalty in the every- 
day work. Some one spoke of the words that nerved 
so many English soldiers to bravest self-sacrifice: 
“England expects every man to do his duty.” The 
boys liked that; and one of the girls suggested the 
familiar words that seemed now to have new meaning: 
“He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful 
also in much.” These words were written on the board 
for a guide in the week’s work. “Do the duty that lies 
nearest,” was chosen for another board. The pupils 
begged to be allowed to copy in their blank-books 
the story of the heroic gatekeeper. That became a 
language lesson. And from Monday to Friday, — 
who knows how much later stillp—-the thought of 
the Monday-morning talk bore fruit in loyal, faithful 
work. 
Ill THE SCHOOLROOM ATMOSPHERE. 
School A and School B are in the same quarter of 
the village of Smithtown. Both are provided with 
excellent teachers and good buildings. The children 
come from neighboring families. The school board 
furnish equal facilities in both schools for training the 
young idea. Yet their work is very different, and the 
results are different as well. 
In A, the children work with might and main, —a 
good thing to do. One knows, without being told, that 
there is a great deal to be done, and very little time 
in which to do it. There is hurry, and tension, and 
pressure. The teacher's attitude speaks it; her manner.
-P-A-G-E-245
THE SCHOOLROOM ATMOSPHERE. 245 
  
impresses it; her voice gives it emphasis. Every move 
ment, every direction, seems to say, “Hurry up.” ‘John, 
don’t you know we must finish fractions this term? 
And here we are only in addition, and you are likely to 
take the whole morning in explaining your problem,” 
is the message conveyed by her glance at the boy who 
is at work in the arithmetic class. The entire school 
hears the key-note, and responds according to capacity. 
They hurry to the recitation, they hasten back to their 
seats. Their very slates catch the spirit of the occasion, 
and tumble to the floor in their eagerness to be ready 
at the proper moment. The teacher's brow knits at 
the signal; the children recognize the fact, and hurry 
with renewed zeal to make up lost time. There is much 
to be done and life is short. 
School B moves on in different fashion. A casual 
observer might question whether it were really moving. 
There is neither bustle nor confusion. The teacher 
works serenely, as if with the consciousness that with 
every appointed labor there is likewise an appointed 
time. The children share her serenity, and work quietly. 
Yet they work, nevertheless. Every moment counts, 
every direction is full of meaning. No words are 
wasted, no work is carelessly done. But there is no 
sense of hurry in the room. There is time for songs, 
for gymnastics, for reading. Nothing is said about the 
work to be done to-morrow, until to-day’s work is 
done; and to-day’s work is done to-day. I have heard 
it said that at examination time,—the dread period 
which overshadows all the hours spent in schoolroom 
A, — the work is no better done than in schoolroom B. 
One who knows tells me that the children of the first 
school fail oftener than do the pupils at B, — but why?
-P-A-G-E-246
  246 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
  
The atmosphere of the two rooms is essentially dif- 
ferent. The first contains the elements of failure; the 
second, of success. The pupils are spurred to highest 
tension in the one; they are held to steady endeavor in 
the other. In A the haste is in itself a confession of 
weakness; in B the serenity betokens reserved strength, 
The one teacher trains her pupils to impatience; the 
other cultivates peace. 
Does it matter, this radical difference? For the dif- 
ference is seen not only in Smithtown, but wherever 
American children are taught. And schools where the 
high-tension atmosphere exists are not, perhaps, in the 
minority. Does it tell in “results” ? 
Its effect can be easily seen in the school discipline. 
Any tendency to nervousness or irritability, however 
latent, is speedily intensified. The schoolroom griev- 
ances which have their root in impatience or lack of 
self-control, are multiplied, and the calm, even judg- 
ment that looks fairly at all sides of a question is 
lacking. The very quality that bestirs the uneasiness 
is at variance with the methods which alone could 
subdue it. 
Again, the working power is diminished, because not 
wisely used. For continued work an atmosphere of 
excitement is not wholesome. Strength comes, not with 
attempting with great exertion tasks too heavy for us to 
accomplish, but in repeating again and again labor that 
lies within our power. No one questions that the work- 
man who labors steadily and serenely in tasks fitted to 
his ability endures longer than the one who worries over 
burdens beyond his strength. To know how to use our 
strength to best advantage is better than to use twice 
the power in ill-directed effort. The quiet, well-planned
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE PROGRAMME. 247 
  work of schoolroom B must bring better results in 
working power than will the hurrying zeal of school- 
room A. 
The knowledge gained is none the less sure where the 
path is traversed step by step, rather than by leaps. 
The associations that cluster about it are wholesome, 
peace-giving. The ideals are higher when the thought 
is on the growth that comes of patient labor, rather than 
pn the knowledge to be gained in a given semester. The 
habits of work, of thought, of life, must be more vigorous 
and more sturdy than those which are the outcome of 
anxious haste. 
We may well hold before us, in our teaching, strong, 
steady, quiet work as an ideal, and strive to make our 
practice attain to it. The remedy lies largely, as does 
the fault, with the teacher herself. She can plunge 
her pupils into hurry and worry, or she can lead them 
through honest work into paths of peace. She can 
fasten their eyes upon the answer to the present problem, 
pr make them glory in the conscious strength that comes 
ef patient labor. She can choose patience instead of fret- 
fulness, growth instead of per cents, cheerfulness instead 
of worry, vigor rather than excitement. The children 
will follow where she leads. 
Iv. THE PROGRAMME. 
The routine of the schoolroom work, the every-day 
order of doing things, demands careful forethought on 
the part of the teacher. Her arrangement of work may 
insure friction, disorder, and loss of energy, or it may 
go far toward preventing these misfortunes. The fol-
-P-A-G-E-248

248 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
lowing suggestions may throw some light upon the 
making of the programme, at least to those teachers 
who have not already learned by experience how to 
overcome the difficulties involved in the subject. 
There should be a carefully arranged programme for 
every day’s recitation and study, and this programme 
should be faithfully followed. “ A time for everything, 
and everything done in its time” is as vital a principle 
of order as “A place for everything, and everything put 
in its place.” The regular recurrence of certain exer- 
cises at certain times of the day helps to fix the habit 
of punctuality, to ensure careful preparation, to provide 
for every subject its appropriate time, regardless of the 
preference or delay of teacher and pupils, and further, 
saves the time and energy which would be lost through 
haphazard plans and lack of preparation. Every child 
in school should know just what he has to do, and 
when and how he has to do it. If the blackboard 
is needed for other things the programme should be 
plainly printed upon a sheet of heavy paper, and posted 
where it may be easily seen by all pupils and visitors. 
A small copy should lie upon the teacher’s desk. The 
older pupils should copy upon a card their own order 
of exercises. 
The programme having been outlined and understood, 
it should be carefully followed; otherwise it is useless. 
An exercise named for a certain hour and minute 
should begin at that moment, and should close as 
promptly. Pupils and teacher should form the habit of 
being ready at the appointed time. If the programme 
is familiar to the pupils, this preparation should be 
made individually and quietly, without direction from 
the teacher. The tap of the pencil or the word to
-P-A-G-E-249
  ‘THE PROGRAMME. 249 
  
the class should be sufficient signal on the part of the 
teacher. Every child should understand the part be- 
longing to him without further directions. The repeti- 
tion of “ Quietly!” “ Carefully!” and the like, is worse 
than useless. It begets indifference. The habit of the 
class should be that of quiet and care-taking. This 
should be taught in the beginning, and expected in 
every movement, without repetition of the requirement. 
If attention is given to the details of turning, standing, 
and movement, as has elsewhere been said, the wheels 
of the programme will be well oiled, and will there- 
fore run easily. 
It goes without saying that a programme may need 
to be reconstructed several times to fit the needs of a 
school. The teacher should be prepared the first morn- 
ing of school with an experimental programme which 
will be modified as she finds occasion. But even this 
programme should be carefully followed so long as it 
stands for the order of the day. The habit of regular- 
ity can be developed in no better way. 
The making of the programme presupposes thought- 
ful grading of the school, and grouping into classes. 
The number of pupils in a class, and so the number of 
classes, will depend upon the age and ability of the 
pupils and the power of the teacher. When children 
first enter school a recitation period of ten minutes is 
long enough. They have not grown to the power of 
continued attention. Such classes may be taught in 
small groups, since the period is short, and there is time 
for more recitations. As the pupils grow in power of 
attention, and the teacher grows in her power to hold 
the attention of many pupils at once, the divisions may 
be larger and the periods longer, until the school is
-P-A-G-E-250
  250 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
    
divided into two equal divisions, having lesson periods 
of fifteen or twenty minutes each. With such a division 
of pupils, many exercises, as Music, Drawing, Writ- 
ing, Language, and General Lesson, will belong to the 
school as a whole, division being made for Reading 
and Number, only. This arrangement can easily be 
made in schools of one grade. It allows all pupils 
some opportunity for individual preparation of lessons, 
and at the same time permits the instruction of the 
entire class together whenever new points are to be 
presented. 
In all programmes, the exercises should be so arranged 
as to afford variety. The child’s interest and attention 
flag if held too long to one kind of work. Writing 
should alternate with book study, number with draw~- 
ing, physical exercise should follow work involving 
little movement. Music should break the monotony 
of quiet study, recess should permit entire relaxation 
and recreation. In providing seat work, this matter 
should be considered, and variety of occupation should 
be provided. A table at which the pupil may stand to 
cut, paste, model, or arrange forms, allows little chil- 
dren the freedom of movement which they need. Work 
at the blackboard also affords opportunity for variety 
in position and movement. 
Simple physical exercises in the intervals of the pro- 
gramme rest the tired muscles and freshen the school- 
room atmosphere. Let the little children run, fly, or 
skip to their seats, sometimes making the circuit of the 
schoolroom. Let the entire school clap their hands, 
stand upon their feet, upon their tiptoes, stretch their 
fingers, shake their hands, whenever the air becomes 
heavy and the class listless. A stanza from a merry
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE PROGRAMME. 251 
song helps at such a time, —a bright story or a hearty 
laugh; children will turn with new and heartier en- 
deavor to their work after such a movement of rest 
and recreation. 
The seat work has two general aims, —to prepare 
for the coming recitation, or to repeat and apply a 
truth learned in the preceding one. The programme 
should prepare for both the preparation and the drill, 
affording appropriate periods for each. In primary 
classes the latter will predominate, as the new ideas are 
in most cases presented by the teacher in oral instruc- 
tion. After careful study w7th the teacher, the pupils 
learn how to study alone the new lessons in spelling 
and reading. To these their study of new work is 
chiefly confined. 
The repetition of language or general lessons and the 
application of new knowledge in number, should follow 
the period of oral work in those subjects; the study of 
the reading lesson should follow the period of oral 
word study and precede the reading. 
Although no period is allotted in the programme for 
the correction of seat work, it should not be forgotten. 
Some of the written work can be discussed in the ap- 
propriate recitation period. The classes may be dis- 
missed a moment before the next period opens, and a 
swift yet careful glance may be given to the work ar- 
ranged upon slate or desk. A word of caution or 
approval, when the child is still in touch with his 
work, counts more than ample criticism when the 
time has passed. We have spoken elsewhere of the 
preparation, distribution, and commendation of work 
at the seats. 
The discussion of the programme is not complete with-
-P-A-G-E-252
252 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
out some reference to the teacher’s preparation for her 
work. The daily preparation for the lessons of the 
day ensures the effectual moving of the programme and 
the success of the school work. With inexperienced 
teachers, this preparation should be even minute in 
detail. The writer remembers a day-book in which 
items were entered daily, during and after class exer- 
cises, in the order of the programme. “ Bring pictures 
to show mountains.” “John S. fails on 9 times 7.” 
“Prepare spherical objects for drawing.” “ Review all 
words studied this week.” ‘“ Look up Whittier’s ‘ Boy- 
hood.’” The pages of the book became a record of 
the work of the class, and afforded a basis for reviews. 
The memoranda helped in the detailed preparation of 
the lessons, and so prevented the hurry and confusion 
which result from lack of preparation. They helped 
the teacher to fulfil her many promises to the pupils 
and thus to hold their confidence. And they went far 
to secure the interest and attention which are accorded 
to all lessons which speak a fresh and thoughtful prep- 
aration on the part of the teacher.

THE LESSON. 255 
  Vv. THE LESSON. 
The effectual teaching exercise is the one for which 
the teacher is thoroughly prepared. The definiteness 
of her preparation depends upon her knowledge of 
the subject, and upon her conception of the ideal — 
teaching exercise. Our purpose in these few pages 
is to present some of the characteristics of the good 
teaching exercise. 
The results to be obtained through the lessons are 
three: knowledge-getting, power-getting, and the test 
of knowledge and power. According to the result 
to be obtained, then, we have the three classes of 
teaching exercises, — the lesson whose object is to 
impart new knowledge, the lesson whose object is to 
afford practice in using this knowledge, thus gaining 
new power, and the lesson whose object is to test or 
measure the pupil's knowledge or power, 
How can zew knowledge be presented to the child? 
Only through the appropriate illustration of the truth 
to be taught or the objects to be known. If the idea 
is entirely new to the child, it must enter through the 
appropriate sense. He must taste the lump of sugar 
to know that it is sweet, see it to know it is white, 
handle and see it to know its form and hardness. 
He must hear the bird sing to know its note, must 
smell of the flower to know its fragrance. Only from 
the object, appealing to his senses, can the child get 
new ideas of qualities and relations. And only from 
repeated concrete illustrations of a general truth can 
he come to the apprehension of the truth as universal. 
He is told that 6 blocks and 2 blocks are 8 blocks, that 
6 boys and 2 boys are 8 boys, and so on, until he begins
-P-A-G-E-256
  256 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
to realize that 6 and 2 are 8. He finds 4 angles in this 
square, and in this, and this, until unconsciously he 
pictures the 4 angles as belonging to every square. 
He learns that a fraction is one of the equal parts 
into which anything is divided, by dividing into equal 
parts and naming the parts. The first essential to 
good instruction is right illustration of the point to 
be taught. 
To secure such illustration, the teacher must have 
definitely in mind what she wishes to teach. For 
example, the child is to be taught what is meant by 
one half of anything. He has already an indefinite 
idea, and uses the term. But he is to be led to the 
exact use of the term. The teacher decides that the 
definition to be presented is this: “One half is one of 
the two equal parts into which anything is divided.” 
What illustration is demanded? Something which can 
be divided into two equal parts. An apple? No, for 
the child should prove the equality, and he can apply 
no test to the apple. Strings, strips of paper, squares, 
circles, — or better, all of these,— should be used. 
Lack of definiteness in the teacher’s thought will lead 
to lack of definiteness in the illustration. 
The points to be illustrated should be presented in 
definite order. In this lesson the points are these: — 
1. A something is divided. 
2. It is divided into two parts. 
3. These parts are equal. 
4. The name of one such part is one half. 
Order in the presentation of the steps will secure 
orderly thought and complete expression. Such exer- 
cises, continued long enough, will develop the habit of 
systematic thought and expression.
-P-A-G-E-257
THE LESSON. 257 
  The questions should be definite, inducing and 
directing thought,— not, “What about the parts of 
the circle?” but, “How do the parts compare in 
size?” They should not contain the answer, as, “The 
parts are equal, aren’t they?” This leaves no room 
for the child’s thinking; he simply echoes the teacher's 
words. They should be well, stated, — not, “Sposen I 
cut this square in two,” but, “Watch! what did I 
do?” “You cut the square in two.” “Into how 
many parts did I cut it?” “You cut it into two 
parts.” “ How do these parts compare in size?” “They 
are equal.” 
After the teacher’s questions have led the children 
to interpret the illustration, they should tell what they 
have learned, that she may be assured that they have 
seen truly. ‘We divided the string into two equal 
parts; each part was one half of the string.” “We 
cut the square into two equal parts; each part was 
one half of the square.” The value of the different 
illustrations is shown here. From the many presented 
the child is led to the general statement, “When any- 
thing is divided into two equal parts, one of the parts 
is one half.” Or, “One half of anything is one of the 
two equal parts of the thing.” 
The third step is to lead the child to apply his 
knowledge. “Find me one half of the square. Pour 
me a half of a quart of water. Show me one half of 
a circle. Fold this paper in halves.” See, tell, apply; 
this is the order of illustration. 
Following the first exercise for the presentation of 
new knowledge, should come the opportunity for prac- 
tice, — the drill, or the recitation. The new knowledge 
is to be fixed in the child’s mind; he is to become 
a7
-P-A-G-E-258
258 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
skilled in using it. His practice is to develop habits 
of right seeing, thinking, telling. Therefore the teacher 
assigns seat work which demands use of the knowledge 
just presented. In the case above illustrated, after 
the child becomes skilful in drawing, cutting, and meas- 
uring and estimating halves of single things, he is set to 
finding halves of groups of objects. The work set for 
the child should always demand thought, and some 
measure of exertion of his powers. Otherwise it is 
not helpful; it keeps him still, not busy. Let every 
exercise be a little harder than the last achievement; 
then the child will grow. 
In the pages given to the discussion of seat work we 
have noted the essentials, and so may pass them now 
to consider the oral recitation. This is intended simply 
to afford additional drill, or as a test. 
If the object is drill, the teacher should assure herself 
that the exercise affords needed drill. The statement 
seems absurdly simple, but this axiom is not consciously 
heeded in all schoolrooms. We will suppose that the 
teacher is questioning a second-grade class on the facts 
in the numbers to twenty. John does not know that 8 
and 7 are 15. “Next,” is the teacher's word. “Next” 
does not know more than John, and the question trails 
down the class till Mary answers it. ‘8 and 8 are how 
many?” the teacher continues. Now, every failure on 
the 8 and 7 was a flag waved in her face, warning her 
that here was the xeed of drill. But she did not heed 
it, and the children went to their seats no wiser than 
before. 
Quite as significant as the failures are the correct 
replies. Little drill is needed along lines where the chil- 
dren meet with no difficulty. Such repetition is useless.
-P-A-G-E-259
THE LESSON. 259 
  
Questions should be introduced often enough to provide 
a review, to prevent forgetting, but the major part of the 
recitation should be given to the weak places. 
A good recitation relates the old to the new, instead 
of treating the lesson as an isolated whole. The lesson 
on rivers should be introduced by a review of brooks, 
the lesson on the square calls for the review of straight 
lines and right angles. All the new thoughts should be 
connected with what has preceded, in logical lines. 
“Yesterday we learned what are the directions of the 
prevailing winds over the Atlantic Ocean; to-day we 
will study to see the effects of these winds ;” or ‘ Yester- 
day we studied the life in the hot zone; to-day we will 
compare with that the life in the cold zone.” The review 
should enable the child to see the subject as a whole, 
knowing each part in relation to the whole. If the 
teacher recognizes this relation her teaching will be 
direct, organized, simple, for she will recognize the few 
main topics about which all knowledge is centred, and 
will lead the child to arrange the knowledge which he 
gains in the same way. Such grouping prevents the 
confusion and weakness of incoherent memorizing, the 
gathering of facts and stowing them away without regard 
to use or relation. 
Further, in a good recitation a// members of the class 
recite; all the time of the recitation is of value to every 
pupil. This is brought about in the first place by the 
attention of all pupils to the work in hand. If every 
child is held responsible for knowing all that is said 
in the class by teacher and pupils, he gets the full 
benefit of the entire lesson. He may not answer every 
question, but he thinks the answer. The power to hold 
the attention of the class means the power to teach. It
-P-A-G-E-260
  260 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  causes all the children to learn. This power may be 
strengthened where it is weak by careful study of the 
subject, so that the teacher is brimful of what she 
desires the child to know, and imparts her own interest 
to him; and by careful preparation of every lesson, so 
that she is free from all bondage to books; and by care 
in questioning. The questions should be distributed, 
not confined to the pupils in the front seats or to those 
who raise their hands. The dull pupils and the bright 
ones should share alike, each receiving what he most 
needs. An inattentive pupil should be questioned often 
and held responsible for hearing and discussing his 
neighbors’ replies. Until the teacher knows the names 
of all her pupils, and even later with older classes, it is 
well to use cards bearing the names of the pupils. These 
may be rearranged after every recitation. Their use will 
insure the recitation of every member of the class, and 
yet keep the pupils from counting upon their “ turn.” 
In every case the questions should be placed before 
the name of the child; otherwise all but the elect may 
feel absolved from listening. 
The thoughtful teacher will guard against too close 
adherence to question-and-answer recitations. Such les- 
sons, however logical and complete, may leave the 
pupil without a complete grasp of the subject as a 
whole. He may see his part and no other. Recitation 
from topics leads to fuller statement and more compre- 
hensive views of the subject. Such recitations lead to 
the habit of complete and logical arrangement and the 
power to think on one’s feet. They develop self-confi- 
dence, a requisite to good work of any kind. The child 
who can stand before the class and readily tell all he has 
learned about a subject, will hold his knowledge in a
-P-A-G-E-261
fHE LESSON. 261 
  
form and in a place where he can use it to good 
advantage later. 
The tests should be conducted differently from the 
ordinary recitation. In the test the teacher’s object is to 
discover what the child knows and what he does not 
know. She will not wait to teach or suggest, in case of 
failure. She will either drop the question or pass it on. 
The result of the test is not only a measure of the 
child’s knowledge, but a guide to her future teaching. 
It shows needed lines of work. 
The exercise should test some definite line of work. 
If there is opportunity for twenty kinds of mistakes 
it will prove less helpful than if it discloses one or two 
faults. The pupils will set to work correcting the few; 
he will be discouraged by the correction. 
The real value of the test to the child lies in his cor- 
rection of his errors. It was Josh Billings who said, 
“ Success depends, not on never making a mistake, but 
on never making the same one twice.” The child should 
know what the test teaches, and should set bravely to 
work to overcome the difficulties which it suggests. He 
will not be helped by copying his teacher’s corrections; 
he must learn zot to make the mistake, Zow not, and 
why not. 
The test should be not only a test of memory, but a 
test of power to work along new lines, related to the 
old. If the child can add 2 to 2, see if he can add it 
to 32. If he can add one fraction to another, see if he 
can subtract. If he has studied the Mississippi basin 
with you, see if he can study the Nile by himself. 
Reach forward, and teach the children to do the same. 
Require and expect hard work, yet work that can be 
done. Develop the habit of honest, faithful, and
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
diligent attention to the duty of the hour in all 
recitations. 
The lessons have been well taught if the child knows 
what he has learned, or knows how to find out if he has 
forgotten. If he has developed a love for study and a 
desire to learn, if he has become diligent in business 
and has grown in power, the teacher may know that her 
work has been well done. 
VI. THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOL- 
ROOM. 
The young teacher usually finds, or thinks that she 
finds, the greatest difficulty in the discipline of the 
schoolroom. She may be mistaken in measuring the 
difficulties. Lack of ability to teach well is not so 
apparent to her inexperience as is the evident disorder 
of her pupils. And it is true that no good teaching 
can be done in the school which is badly disciplined. 
It may be well, therefore, to consider the purpose and 
the means of school government before attempting to 
discuss methods of teaching. 
There are two immediate and important ends in view 
in the discipline of the school. There must be enough 
quiet and system to enable the daily work of the school 
to move on easily and without friction or interruption ; 
hence certain rules and routines are agreed upon which 
will facilitate the doing of this work. But while this 
end is important, the second is far more so. Through 
compliance with these rules and habitual obedience to 
the teacher’s direction, as well as habitual regard for 
the rights and privileges of others, the child grows to a 
power of self-control and an ability to work in harmony
-P-A-G-E-263
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOLROOM. 263 
  
with his fellows. In too many schoolrooms is this 
greater aim overlooked, and the discipline is made a 
matter of the present moment, having to do with the 
schoolroom tasks alone. But the manner in which 
the child works at his task, or yields to authority, and 
the spirit in which he learns to restrain his impulses 
and to guide his wayward thoughts have. to do with 
the growth of his character. The effect of the school- 
room discipline is lasting. It tells for good or evil 
upon the future life of the child. It helps him to be- 
come a thoughtful, helpful, law-abiding citizen, or 
leaves him a weakling where he should be a man. It 
results in habits of clear thinking, power of attention 
and capacity for work, or in dull indifference. Every 
schoolroom exercise helps toward some one of these 
ends. The means of discipline, its spirit and purpose, 
ought then to be carefully considered by every teacher. 
Good discipline is reasonable, not arbitrary. As far 
as possible, the child should understand the reason for 
the teacher’s requirements. Whispering is forbidden, 
not because it is wrong in itself, but because it draws 
the attention of the whisperer and his mate away from 
the work they should be doing. Snow-balling is good 
in its place but it cannot be allowed when the small 
boys and girls are disturbed or hurt in the game. It 
is the duty of the older ones to defend and protect the 
younger children; for their sakes they should gladly 
abstain from their favorite game until there is no dan- 
ger to the younger children. It is not wrong to ask 
a question, but it is unwise to interrupt a class recitation 
in order to do so. The pupils who are reciting are 
thus defrauded of a part of their time. Even the 
youngest children will readily recognize the need of  
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
restraining their impulses to speak or move or play, 
when the gratification of their desires would interfere 
with the work or the enjoyment of others; and through 
such teaching and training they come to the attitude 
which all citizens of the republic should learn. They 
know the meaning of liberty under law. 
There is a wide difference between the spirit in such 
training and that which allows each child license to do 
as he pleases, without regard to the good of his neigh- 
bor. In such a school freedom does not exist; rather 
lawlessness reigns supreme. The teacher fails even te 
accomplish her immediate purpose of allowing the 
children to please themselves. What pleases one very 
soon interferes with what pleases another, and the re- 
sult is disturbance. But under the principle which we 
have suggested, the purpose of all the children is to 
help one another, and the individual rights cease when 
they interfere with the general good. Here is truest 
liberty ; and such harmonious working together is the 
result of right discipline. This reasonableness does 
not imply that there shall be no implicit obedience 
without question; rather, it tends toward that obedi- 
ence. A child who recognizes the justice of a teacher's 
requirements in general, will be ready to go on in par- 
ticular cases without explanation, because his teacher 
thinks it best. And there must be times in his experi- 
ence both as boy and man, when he yields to the law 
without knowing the reason why, but cheerfully never- 
theless, because he believes in his leader. Such obe- 
dience to law can never be taught by arbitrary author- 
ity. The discipline of the court-martial has no place 
in the schoolroom, nor does it result in habitual and 
thoughtful obedience.
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOLROOM. 265 
  
The motive is the important factor in school discipline. 
Pupils readily recognize the teacher’s motive; they are 
keen observers of human nature; they know when a 
command is given because the teacher is fretful, impa- 
tient, or angry, and when it is the outcome of a deliberate 
intent and constant desire to help the child, or to benefit 
the school. Children will endure any punishment which 
their sense of justice shows them is deserved; they will 
demand fair play for themselves and for others. The 
teacher who inspires her pupils with confidence in her 
motive will have little trouble in controlling them. 
The children should not only recognize the teacher’s 
general purpose in her discipline, but they should con- 
sciously obey the highest motive in their own action. 
This does not mean, necessarily, the highest motive 
which the teacher can comprehend, but the highest 
which the children can appreciate. They should re- 
frain from whispering, not because they fear reproof 
or punishment, but because they are willing to deny 
themselves for the good of others; because they desire 
the teacher’s approval and that of their own conscience ; 
because they would win the power of self-control. It 
may be necessary in the earlier stages, to appeal to 
fear of punishment or love of praise, but this should 
give way to the desire of approval of conscience and 
the love of right-doing. 
The wise teacher leaves to her pupils, as far as pos- 
sible the power of choice; she leads them to see the 
result of one course of action and of its opposite, and 
then leaves them to choose. Thus she cultivates their 
judgment and leads them to independent right doing. 
The question of snow-balling is to be decided; instead 
of stating her decision, announcing a rule, and the pen-  
-P-A-G-E-266
    266 TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
—— —  —— 
alty attached to its infringement, she presents the case 
to the pupils and leaves them to decide for themselves. 
“Tf you throw snowballs when you choose, accidents 
will happen, as we have already learned in our experi- 
ence. Little ones will be hurt; how can we help it?” 
“ They can keep out of the way.” “But have they not 
the same right to the playground that the older ones 
have?” ‘They can stay on their side.” “Are the 
school grounds large enough to make that entirely safe?” 
“No.” “What then?” “We shall have to give it up 
except when they are safely out of the way.” “What 
shall be our rule, then?” The pupils will yield ready 
obedience to rules which they have framed for themselves 
and whose justice they recognize. They will decide 
with equal justice what penalty should be attached to 
breaking a rule; and this power to reason and to act 
upon principle, is worth far more than the simple habit 
of doing without reasoning, — though “ The Charge ot 
the Light Brigade” might imply the opposite. 
Habits of action are formed through repetition. 
Every act leaves in the mind a tendency to repeat that 
action and added power to act in that direction. So 
every right choice helps to develop the habit of right 
choosing ; every act of obedience tends to strengthen the 
habit of obedience; every exercise of self-control results 
in greater power of self-command. The continued repe- 
tition of right action makes such action habitual; it 
becomes second nature to the child. Left to himself at 
the end of the school life he will tend to continue in the 
line of such action. The schoolroom habits are an 
important outcome of the schoolroom discipline. 
The habits which the child should gain are too many > 
to enumerate here, but a few of them should stand in  
-P-A-G-E-267
  
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOLROOM. 267 
  the foreground: the habit of obedience, of which we 
have spoken, the habit of self-control, the habit of alle- 
giance to principle, the habit of overcoming obstacles, 
the habit of enduring discomfort cheerfully, the habit of 
doing for others, the habit of kindly feeling, the habit of 
courteous expression, the habit of truth-telling, the 
habit of punctuality and order. The list might be con- 
tinued indefinitely; each one is indispensable to a well- 
formed character; each one may be strengthened in 
the schoolroom. 
The discipline which the child gains in his play- 
ground experiences is not less valuable than that of the 
schoolroom. The child comes from home, where he is 
the centre of admiring relatives, to the schoolroom 
where he is one among many, having equal privileges 
with all, but no more. He competes with his mates in 
the various games and is measured by his actual suc- 
cess. He is knocked down by accident and is expected 
to get up, brush the dust from his clothes, and join in the 
game again without a murmur. If he withdraws to a 
corner to nurse his bruises, he is soon left alone with 
them, though not until he has heard expressions of 
boyish sympathy and condolence. If he goes weeping 
to the teacher, she says, if she is wise, “I am sorry you 
are hurt. Some cold water will help it. But brave boys 
bear hurts like men; they do not cry.” Through such 
experiences the boy grows strong to endure hardship. 
Just as surely the thoughtful teacher leads the children 
to care for one another in real hurts, to guide the little 
feet, and to keep the lame from stumbling. The asso- 
ciation of children, small and great in our ungraded 
schools should induce chivalric kindliness on the part 
of the strong, and brave endurance on the part of the

weak. If the teacher is in sympathy with her pupils, 
and shares their play-ground experiences, her influence 
will tend to secure these results. 
The routine work of the schoolroom should be so 
arranged as to prevent friction and disorder, thus avoid- 
ing the necessity of reproof or punishment, and leaving 
the time free for study, instruction, and recitation. Les- 
sons should be given in the first days of the term to 
teach the pupils how to move together, to come and go 
to and from the recitation, to stand and to work at the 
board, to go out and come in at recess. This prear- 
ranged order of movement will prevent collision and 
disturbance. In the first exercises, when the pupils are 
practising these movements, the directions should be 
definitely and quietly given. After the children have 
become accustomed to the order of movement, a signal 
may be substituted for the complete direction. This 
should be slight and quiet. Noise does not command 
attention. Let the voice be low, clear and decisive, 
impelling quiet, thoughtful attention to the exercise. 
Such routine saves time and energy on the part of 
both children and teacher, and gives the schoolroom a 
quiet and business-like atmosphere. Although the form 
in itself is of minor importance, it can be so taught and 
followed as to develop systematic habits of work, and to 
allow freedom for the study. 
All directions, whether by word or signal, should be 
exactly followed by every pupil. The school should 
move as aunit. We frequently hear teachers direct as if 
they did not anticipate obedience. ‘“ Books in the desks, 
children. John, did you hear me? Kate, what did I 
say? Every child is to place his books in the desk.” 
All these directions are implied in the first. Such reit- 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOLROOM. 269 
  eration of commands makes them meaningless. The 
child waits for the last chance. The teacher should 
expect and should obtain absolute compliance with her 
least request, and this from all the pupils in the room 
without delay. 
Many occasions of disorder in the schoolroom would 
be prevented by a right apportionment of lessons, 
adapted to the capacity of the children, and varied 
from day to day so as to secure interest. The mischief 
found “ for idle hands to do” can be banished by work 
alone. Careful preparation of the day’s lessons before- 
hand makes the teacher ready with task, material, and 
directions. Each pupil knows just what to do, when to 
do it, and how. The need of questions and comment 
is obviated by the concise directions. Pupils can be 
trained to distribute pens, pencils, paper, etc., quietly 
and expeditiously, in some definite order, thus relieving 
the teacher for more important work, and creating in 
them the spirit of helpfulness. 
The teacher's preparation for the teaching exercise 
or recitation enables her to present her subject in a 
manner interesting to the pupils, to illustrate vividly, 
and to be free from all need of reference to “the book.” 
Thus she can hold the attention of the pupils. They 
will not be attentive if they are not interested. They 
will not be interested if the teacher is tied fast to the 
question and answer of the text-book. And out of the 
indifference and inattention spring disorder and its atten- 
dant trouble. When the children are truly interested in 
their lessons this avenue of difficulty is closed. 
Beyond the careful preparation for her lessons and 
the details of the schoolroom work, the teacher needs 
sympathy with child life, and power to put herself into 
   
-P-A-G-E-270
  270 | TALKS ON SCHOOL SUBJECTS. 
  
the child’s place. Many an offence against the rules of 
school is committed thoughtlessly, yet is treated by 
the teacher as if it were an act deliberately intended. 
Such an assumption on the part of the teacher leads to 
wilful disobedience later, for it stirs a sense of injustice 
which rankles in the child’s heart long after the teacher 
has forgotten the offence. She should learn to judge 
from the child’s standpoint in order to see both sides 
and to deal justly. 
The wise teacher often shuts her eyes to misde- 
meanors which would be emphasized by open reproof. 
The attention of the school is attracted by the repri- 
mand to faults which otherwise they would never see. 
If the teacher is constantly calling for order, the pupils 
become impressed with the fact that the school is disor- 
derly, and that the teacher cannot help it. A quiet 
word to the offender, a look or sign, a conversation 
after school when nobody else knows, are better than 
the open correction. They do not arouse the spirit 
of defiance as does the open reproof. The teacher’s 
manner in necessary direction, should assume the inten- 
tion to obey, not antagonism. Her attitude toward the 
child does much to determine his own. Anticipating 
obedience and good-will, she will find them; looking 
for malice and mutiny, she will doubtless discover them 
likewise. 
Rules of action should be decreed only when occa- 
sion demands them. The reason for them will then 
be apparent, and they will not seem to the pupils arbé 
trary exercise of authority. Once made, they should 
be carefully followed. They should not be enforced 
with severity one day and forgotten the next. 
Penalties should be in line with the offence when

possible. The child who cannot play with his mates 
without quarrelling must take his recess alone. The 
abuse of a privilege should be followed by its with- 
drawal. Punishments may and should be slight, but 
certain. The teacher’s even and steady persistence 
in the course she considers right, counts for more than 
undue severity. 
In regard to the discipline of the child, far more 
than his instruction, the teacher comes in contact with 
the parents. She should, from the beginning, consider 
their rights and privileges as well as her own, and act 
accordingly. As far as possible, she should acquaint 
herself with the home life of the children. Such 
knowledge will enable her to interpret their school 
life, explaining many habits and tendencies with which 
she must contend, and giving her the patience which 
comes of understanding. Such knowledge helps her 
to interpret the motive of the act, and often restrains 
the harsh judgment or unmerited reproof. The child 
who was late because her mother was sick and she was 
needed to “ mind the baby,” will not be dealt with in 
the same manner as the boy who stopped to play 
marbles. 
The child who has inherited a tendency to untruth 
and trickery will be taught more patiently, rather 
than judged more harshly, if the teacher appreciates 
the low ideal which is accepted in his home. Many 
a child finds in the schoolroom his strongest incentive 
toward right-doing, and finds in the teacher the highest 
ideal which his life has yet held: If she knows the 
spirit which surrounds him at home and the difficulties 
with which he has to contend, she will find herself 
doubly armed to help him in his time of need.

Often this knowledge enables her to judge more 
gently the actions of the parents. Mrs. McCarty de- 
sires Katie’s overshoes to be kept on during the school 
hours. They have been left over from last winter and 
are much too small for the child, so that the process of 
encasing her feet demands stout wrestling. The arbi- 
trary teacher has been heard to say in such a case, 
“T don’t care what your mother says; I say they must 
come off in the schoolroom, and when you are in school 
you will obey me.” Poor Katie is plunged in a gulf 
of dark despair, — her mother’s threats on the one side, 
and her teacher’s demands on the other. A little 
thought on the part of the teacher, a note to the 
mother, a kind word of explanation to Katie, a promise 
of help with the refractory shoes, would make the 
matter right and bring mother and child into surer 
harmony with the work of the school. Many of the 
requirements and requests of the parents come from 
lack of understanding of the conditions of the school, 
from entire failure to comprehend the results that 
would come if her request were granted. The mother 
naturally sees the home side of the case, and so consults 
her convenience and that of the child. Like the teacher 
she honestly desires the best good of the child, and a 
patient explanation of the schoolroom work would en- 
sure her co-operation. It is well for the teacher to 
assume this from the beginning, — to expect the parents 
to sympathize with her in her work for their children 
and to earn their support by her own appreciation of 
their interest in the children and their desire to do what 
is right. 
Contact with the children in their plays and games 
will often give the teacher an insight into their lives 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
THE DISCIPLINE OF THE SCHOOLROOM. 273 
  
which is not so readily gained through the working 
together in the schoolroom. In the country school the 
teacher has the best of opportunities of learning to 
understand the children in the long noon hour when 
the children who live at a distance must stay at school. 
This is an hour of perplexity and trouble indeed, 
but the teacher who wrestles with these in the right 
spirit will surely obtain the blessing. If the hour is 
spent apart from her in romping and rough games, the 
tumult will hardly be quelled by the school bell, and 
disorder will be rampant in the afternoon as well. 
Many of the occasions for reprimand and punishment 
come from the excess of animal spirits developed in 
the lawlessness of the games at noon. If the teacher 
can win the older children to co-operate with her in 
caring for the younger ones at noon and at recess, she 
may introduce pleasant and profitable games which 
will be helpful as well as hearty, and her own partici- 
pation in the plays will give her a hold upon the confi- 
dence of the children far greater than that gained 
through the schoolroom exercises. It costs patience 
and effort, but it is worth while. Books may be 
brought from the various homes, and stories read aloud; 
the girls may be encouraged to bring their sewing or 
knitting, and while they are making the Christmas or 
birthday presents for mother or father, the teacher is 
made to share in their. home joys and plans. Occupa- 
tions and games will be provided for the little ones 
and the older boys and girls will come to emulate the 
teacher’s spirit in providing for these weaker ones. 
Then there are walks in the fields and woods to discover 
the first wild flowers or the latest checker-berries; to 
find the crow’s nest in the dead pine, or to get a glimpse 
18

of the partridge with her brood. The best of teaching 
can be done in these hours. Or in winter, the teacher 
may don cloak. and hood and mittens and slide down 
the hill, a favored guest of the boy who owns the 
“biggest double-runner.” At her suggestion lame 
Jimmy gets a ride too, and little Kate. The little ones 
are “treated” to long slides down the hill and long 
rides back. The boy who has been able to show this 
kindness to the teacher, and for her sake to the little 
ones, will not fail to behave like a gentleman in the 
later sessions of the school. 
The teacher who can win the children to conscious 
co-operation with her in the direction of school places 
these children on the side of good order and removes 
al) tendency to disturb or annoy. So let Johnny clean 
the blackboards and teach him how to do it quietly 
and well; let Jack beat the chalk dust from the erasers, 
and Jimmy sharpen the pencils; let Mary have a spe- 
cial care of the little ones, and let Kate look after their 
slates; let George go for a pail of water, and let Peter 
“brush up the entry; ” let Kate fill the vase with fresh 
water, and let Mary water the plants; and let these 
duties be regularly done and carefully done, with a 
sense of partnership. Such a participation in the 
schoolroom duties brings a sense of responsibility for 
the well-being of the school that goes far toward assur- 
ing good order and good work.

THE HEALTH SERIES OF SCHOOL PHYSIOLOGIES. 
By Charles H. Stowell, M.D. 
Three books graded from primary classes up to advanced gram- 
mar school and high school grades, though each is complete in 
itself. Each book has been officially endorsed by the Department 
of Scientific Temperance Instruction of the Women’s Christian 
Temperance Union. All are thoroughly scientific, delightfully 
written, and illustrated by cuts made from original drawings. 
I unhesitatingly say that I know of no work upon the subjects here 
treated possessing so many good qualities, both in text and illustrations, 
to commend its use to the public schools. — 4. A. Saunders, M.D., Super 
intendent of Schools, Charlestown, R. I. 
ELEMENTS OF PHYSICS. 
For use in Secondary Schools. By S. P. Meads, Oakland (Cal.) High School. 
The object of this text-book is to familarize students with the 
rudimentary principles and laws that govern matter, so that they 
may make practical application of their knowledge to things about 
them. Simple yet instructive experiments are given, and inter- 
esting facts are evolved touching objects in familiar use, — as the 
telephone, electric bells, the telescope, phonograph, etc. The 
typography of the book is especially fine, and the prominence 
given to important words helps to fix them in the mind. 
AN ELEMENTARY COURSE IN BIOLOGY. 
By F. H. Pillsbury, A.M., late Professor of Biology in Smith College. 
As a thorough guide to laboratory work and the logical study 
of living organisms in the plant and animal kingdoms, Professor 
Pillsbury’s method will be found of valuable service to teachers as 
well as pupils. It is thoroughly up to date, scientific, but not com- 
plex, and its style is clear, analytical, and pertinent to the purpose 
of the book.

  THE NORMAL MUSIC COURSE. 
4 complete series of Music Readers and Charts for every grade of school and 
class instruction in Vocal Music. By Fobn W. Tufts and H. E. Holt. 
The Normal Music Course is the only complete harmonic system 
of vocal instruction, and offers exceptional advantages over the 
older and more conventional methods. It is full of the spirit of 
music, and so skillfully planned and executed that a conscientious 
teacher with very little musical ability can successfully teach it. 
We have been using the Normal Music Course for five years. It is 
very strong pedagogically, and enables the pupil to master musical diffi- 
culties ; and the constant training points to the truest musical effects. — 
Fannie Arnold, Supervisor of Music, Omaha, Neb. 
THE CECILIAN SERIES OF STUDY AND SONG. 
A complete Series of School Song-Books adapted to any grade of Schools, to 
Private Classes, and to Choral Societies. By Fohn W. Tufts. 
As a supplement to the Normal Music Course, or an independent 
Series, the Cecilian Series furnishes a vast number of fresh studies 
and exercises with part songs adapted for all voices. Teachers, 
whether using the Normal Music Course or not, find these books 
indispensable in music work.

  THE NORMAL COURSE IN READING. 
By Supt. W. B. Powell and Emma F. Todd. 
The eight books of this course present a unified series, syste 
matically arranged and graded, and include interesting studies in 
nature, in elementary science, language, geography, history, and 
general literature. 
My teachers join me in the verdict that they are the best readers we 
haveever used. They interest the children in what is about them. Best of 
all, they stimulate thought. — W. H. Hatch, Supt. Public Schs., Moline, lll. 
THE YOUNG FOLKS’ LIBRARY. 
Edited by Larkin Dunton, Head-Master of ‘Boston Normal School. 
The Young Folks’ Library includes “Stories of Child Life, 
four volumes, and “The World and Its People,” five volumes. 
They make delightful supplementary reading, and may be used 
to advantage with Language and Geography Lessons. 
Our teachers have found “The World and Its People” series an in- 
valuable aid in the study of Geography. — Principal of Ward School, 
Cleveland, Ohio. 
My little ones are delighted with “Child Life.” It is what I have 
sought for years. — Principal of Stivers’ School and Kindergarten, 
Chattanooga, Tenn. 
THE RATIONAL METHOD IN READING. 
By Edward G. Ward, Associate Supt. Public Instruction, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
This is a combination of the word (or sentence) method and the 
phonetic method, as set forth in the Manual of Instruction for 
Teachers, used with the Rational Readers and Phonetic Cards. 
The more I study Professor Ward’s method, the better I like it. I am 
satisfied that it is the very best way of teaching reading. All the teachers 
agree that it is most sensible. — Miss E. Palmer, New Haven, Conn.

  THE NORMAL COURSE IN NUMBER. 
By Fobn W. Cook and Miss N. Cropsey. 
The Normal Course in Number consists of “An Elementary 
Arithmetic,” intended for the third, fourth, and fifth grades, and 
“An Advanced Arithmetic,” adapted to the sixth, seventh, and 
eighth grades, and to ungraded schools. - 
There is a freshness and a variety about the “ Elementary Arithmetic,” 
with an encouraging absence of non-essentials, while the material is suffi 
ciently abundant to give thorough drill and practice. — Professor Barnes, 
Leland Stanford Fr. University, Cal. 
The “Advanced Arithmetic” ‘comes the nearest to fully meeting the 
needs of students of any work with which we are acquainted. —G. S- 
Albee, President of State Normal School, Oshkosh, Wis. 
A FIRST BOOK IN ALGEBRA. 
By W. C. Boyden, A.M., Sub-Master of the Boston Normal School. 
This elementary text-book was specially prepared for pupils in 
the upper classes of grammar schools. It connects their arith 
metical knowledge and practice with algebraic operations by a 
dogical progression of thoroughly graded lessons. 
Professor Boyden has performed for us a service we, as teachers, shall 
appreciate. This book is simple in its language, clear and pointed in its 
explanations. — F. 4. Morse, Master of Sherwin Schosl, Boston. 
ELEMENTS OF CIVIL GOVERNMENT. 
By Wm. A. Mowry, Ph. D. 
The fundamental principles of our State and National govern- 
ment explained so as to give students definite knowledge of the 
duties and privileges of American citizenship. “Special State 
Editions” prepared and bound separately. 
It tells just what the student ought to know, and leaves out all discus- 
sion of abstract subjects. I do not see how students can fail to be inter- 
ested in our government, if such a book is placed in their hands. —

PREFACE 
-Turs little manual has grown out of 
the experience of the author in children’s 
garden work, and is the answer to the 
many inquiries which are received from 
various points all over the country from 
persons who are enthusiastic and realize 
the purpose and advantages of the school- 
garden movement, but who have not had 
the agricultural advantages and training 
to understand the best methods of making 
and conducting a garden so as to get good 
results from an agricultural and horticul- 
tural standpoint. It is hoped that this 
little book will be an inspiration to begin- 
ners in the school-garden movement, and 
an aid to those who already have school 
and children’s gardens, so that they can 
obtain the best results from agricul- 
tural, esthetic and educational stand-

points, and so that they can better train 
the head, the heart and the hand. 
The first chapters explain something of 
the development of the school-garden 
movement and how to make a_ school 
garden, while the remaining chapters are 
lessons in garden work. It is hoped these 
simple lessons will be of value; but, as 
every locality is different and the climatic 
and soil conditions vary, it may be found 
necessary to vary the directions some, 
the crops raised, and the size of the 
gardens, the latter of necessity depending 
upon the size of the grounds.

INTRODUCTION 
TuE idea of having a garden connected 
with the school is a very old one. 
Gardening was practised in some European 
schools many years ago, and was carried 
on often for the purpose of increasing the 
salary of the teacher or for furnishing 
products for him. In other schools 
there were botanical gardens where the 
specimens could be studied by the pupils. 
The school-garden movement as it exists 
to-day is of more recent origin, beginning 
about thirty-five years ago. “The progress 
has been most rapid in Europe, where 
there are to-day more than one hundred 
thousand school gardens; France alone 
has more than twenty-eight thousand, and 
in Russia, as in several other countries, no 
school will be accepted by the state to 
receive state funds unless a garden is 
connected withit. In America, the school-

xiv INTRODUCTION 
garden movement is of recent origin, but 
it is gaining ground rapidly. 
As sixty-five per cerit. of our exports 
are products of the farm, it is almost 
_alarming to think that so few of /our 
children know anything about them. 
One reason why nearly ninety per cent. 
of the successful business men of to-day 
were brought up on the farm is because 
of the productive industry taught in 
early childhood in farm life. There is no 
kind of training that squares itself for 
all-round development like agriculture. 
The farmers’ boys are brought up to use 
their hands as well as their heads, and 
learn quick observation and quick decision, 
which is of great value to them throughout 
their lives. The child’s garden certainly 
brings his life more nearly to that of the 
country child than any other form of 
study. As an aid to nature-study there 
is nothing to equal it. It can be used to 
help in nearly every other branch of 
study taught in the schoolroom. The 
practice in measuring and marking out the
-P-A-G-E-13
  
INTRODUCTION XV 
gardens, and in systematically planting 
the seed, gives the child the practical 
mathematics which he so much needs. 
Much language work can be given in 
connection with it; in fact, it can be 
correlated with nearly all the other 
branches, as it furnishes material for 
writing, painting, drawing and geography. 
Even business can be taught, as is done 
at the school gardens at the State Normal 
School at Hyannis, Mass., where the 
products of the gardens are sold, the 
money is taken to the bank and depositéd, 
and the children learn the method of 
depositing money and drawing checks. 
The systematic care of tools and the 
systematic order of doing things, and the 
habits of close observation and of reporting 
observations, acquired by the child, will 
form a trait which will be invaluable to 
him throughout life. Where gardens have 
been conducted for several years, long 
enough to make practical tests, it is 
found that the boys having the garden 
work are thirty per cent. more rapid in
-P-A-G-E-14
  xvi INTRODUCTION 
mental, moral and physical development 
than those not having gardens. The 
school garden tends to develop the best 
traits in the children, and to create in 
them a love for the beautiful. It gives 
play to all their motor activities, 
and shows that results follow causes, 
and is one of the best methods of curing 
them of stealing. They begin to under- 
stand something of ownership and respon- 
sibility, and look more kindly at their 
neighbor’s products, and, as they do not 
wish to lose their own, that for which 
they have worked, the value of the 
product of another is more forcibly 
demonstrated to them. The _ school 
garden can be made especially valuable 
to girls, particularly those in the city, as 
they do not have the same liberties of 
the street as have boys, and are in the 
open air and sunshine all too little for 
good, strong physical development.

can be made exactly the same, be- 
cause of the different conditions of 
space and exposures and the difference 
in the surrounding ‘confftions, @all & 
which should be taken into considera- 
tion. In making the school garden, 
the esthetic side should not be lost 
sight of, ae should it be the entire 
controlling element; but let the esthetic 
and the agricultural elements harmonize. 
If the grounds are small and the only 
space for a garden is along the fence, 
of course there is no choice; and if this 
is all there is, that should be utilized: 
much good can be accomplished even by 
working in a very small space. In the 
absence of any available land on the 
3 ken no two school gardens

' school grounds the use of a nearby vacant 
lot can often be obtained. — 
For lower grades it probably is as well 
to have a general bed or garden. The 
conditions of every place will have to be 
considered; but where conditions are 
favorable for the individual garden, it 
gives a certain amount of responsibility 
and interest that the general garden does 
not. It shows exactly what the individ- 
ual is doing and helps to develop the 
individuality of the child. Very often, 
too, the excellence of several of these 
individual gardens will inspire those to 
much more careful: work who naturally 
are inclined to be a little slack. 
y Where possible, it is better to grow 
both vegetables and flowers. This de- 
velops both the esthetic and the prac- 
tical side of the pupil, and soon the child 
who does not love flowers, if there be 
such, will love the flowers that he raises, 
and in so loving them will be uplifted. 
In growing crops( grow common things. 
Those who have plenty of land can grow

the things that are uncommon; but it is 
much better that the child should know 
the common things, the everyday things 
of life, the things about him, than to 
know what grows in Africa or China or 
Japan. After he knows the common 
things he can learn the others, if there 
be time and space} 
If the gardens are to be individual 
gardens, they should be staked out with 
a stake at each corner, which is driven 
securely into the ground. One of these 
stakes can be numbered; or, better still, 
place an eighteen-inch nursery label in 
the front centre with the number upon it. 
It is easier to keep track of the pupils 
by number than by name, especially if 
there are many of them. With individual 
gardens, they may vary from two feet 
square to ten by one hundred and ninety 
_feet, as do the various school gardens now 
in existence in the United States. Where 
the gardens are of large size, it is found 
easier to have them longer than wide. 
If these gardens are open to exposure on

all sides, the rows should run either north 
and south or east and west. With the 
north and south method, the sun is per- 
haps more evenly distributed to every 
crop, as it goes down the rows between 
them as it passes in its journey. If 
the rows run east and west, for success’ 
it is necessary to plant all high-growing 
plants on the north side, so that they will 
not shade the other crops. If there are 
to be several rows of gardens, this will not 
interfere with the other gardens, as the 
walk will be wide enough to take the 
shadow. “Do not crowd. It is better to 
grow a few crops well than to try to | 
many and not succeed. 
It is not generally wise to use toy tools. 
The triangular hoe which strawberry ‘ 
growers use is light and will be found 
efficient for all purposes. Any child large 
enough to work in a garden can handle 
a ten- or twelve-tooth rake. It will be 
found very convenient to mark the handles 
of the hoes so that the pupils can measure 
by them. A line is almost indispensable,)

and should be long enough to go around 
the entire garden. This can easily be 
made by cutting up a ball of good twine. 
The _ four-strand 
braided twine is 
best for this purpose. 
A twelve-inch pot label 
makes a very good 
stake for one end, and 
has the advantage that 
it can be numbered ; any 
strong stick can be 
utilized for the other 
end. If small crops are 
grown, the hand weeder 
will be found useful, 
although ‘not essential. 
Where the children 
spade up their own 
gardens, the spades 
should be smaller than 
the ordinary garden 
spade.) These can be 
procured, however,

dealers. The land should be thoroughly 
fertilized. ) 
Before going with a class of pupils into 
the gardens to stake them out, it is well 
\to explain what is to be done, and to 
' illustrate if possible on a blackboard. If 
the children are able to lay out the gardens 
accurately without assistance, after it 
has. been explained to them, they are 
certainly above the average. Few chil- 
dren are able to apply their mathematics, 
although they may be very bright in 
book-work: The walks should be so 
arranged that the gardens are easily 
reached from the entrance, where, if 
there is sufficient land and there are 
several rows, five feet’ is not too much 
for the walks between the rows of gardens, 
and there should be a walk of from eight- 
een inches to three feet between each 
garden. This, however, is not always 
feasible and can be dispensed with, but 
it is desirable. Ifthe gardens are next to 
a fence, especially a board fence, the tall 
plants should be located there, regardless

with just enough for the row in each 
package. Otherwise there may be a 
waste. Measuring tape, stakes and a 
mallet or hatchet, and sometimes a 
line, are required for marking out the 
garden. Very good stakes can be made 
by cutting up furring strips, which can

CHAPTER II 
How To PREPARE AND FERTILIZE THE 
Lanp 
Peruaps the most serious problem, 
especially to the city school, after the 
necessary land has been obtained, is, 
How shall we prepare and properly fer- 
tilize it? This is a difficult question to 
answer, as the soil is hardly alike in any 
two places. While fertilizers are usually 
necessary on every soil to some ex- 
tent, tilth is of far greater importance. 
Tilling the soil is to the plant what train- 
ing and schooling is to the child. The 
child and the plant must have proper 
food, to be sure; but that only does not 
develop much of a desirable being. 
If the plot of ground is large enough, 
it should be thoroughly» plowed; and, 
where the subsoil is very compact, the 
13
-P-A-G-E-32
I4 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
plow should be followed in the same 
furrow with the subsoil plow. This 
breaks it up, makes it more porous, 
and allows the water to pass through. 
Small lots, too small to be economically 
plowed, should be spaded; and, where the 
subsoil 1s impervious, it can be trenched. 
If the ground is in turf it should be well 
turned and then thoroughly harrowed. 
If the land was not in turf, or if the turf 
is decayed after plowing, it should be 
replowed, running the furrows in the 
opposite direction. If spaded, the sod 
should be turned deep. It can again be 
lightly spaded. The aim should be to 
give thorough tillage to obtain all possi- 
ble from the land, and then apply ferti- 
lizers to get more.) \Tillage sets at work 
the forces which unlock plant food.) Fer- 
tilizers are more useful to the plant on 
well-tilled land. 
: FARM MANURES 
The valuable plant food in farm manures 
is not so quickly available as in high-grade 
commercial fertilizers; but they have the

additional value of supplying humus, 
which lightens the soil, increasing its 
power to hold water. It also assists in 
liberating the mineral substances in the 
soil. If the manure is coarse, it should 
be rotted to increase its availability” 
before applying. There are three elements 
necessary to supply to the soil: nitrogen, 
potash and phosphoric acid., Farm ma- 
nures supply all of these, but not always’ 
in the proportion needed. 
Commercial fertilizers can be bought 
and applied separately or in combination. 
It must ‘always be remembered that they 
are very powerful and should never be 
, Placed in contact with roots or seeds, but 
should be mixed with the soil. 
Nitrates stimulate the vegetable system 
and tend to produce dark-green foliage. 
' The application of too much nitrogen has 
a tendency to make the plant “run to 
leaves’”’ at the expense of flowers and 
fruit. A lack of nitrogen is shown by 
weak growth of a yellowish-green colour. 
Nitrate of soda and sulfate of ammonia are 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
16 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
the forms in which nitrogen is most often 
used. It should be applied in the pro- 
portion of 150 to 300 pounds per acre. 
Potash, among other effects, stimulates 
the production of plump seed and fruit 
and intensifies the color of the bloom. 
A deficiency of potash is shown by a lack 
of fruit and small, often immature, seeds. 
It is best supplied as sulfate and muriate 
of potash and unleached wood-ashes. 
The latter often has a chemical effect on 
heavy land to some degree the same as 
lime. Sulfate and muriate of potash 
are applied 200 to-400 pounds to the 
acre; wood-ashes, 500 to 1,500 pounds 
to the acre. 
Phosphoric -acid aids in developing 
plump seeds. It is applied in bone com- 
pounds and fossil phosphates, as South 
Carolina and Florida rock. “The applica- 
tion is from 200 to 400 pounds* of treated 
tock per acre. Many fertilizer dealers 
make what they call complete fertilizers 
by mixing the three required elements. 
* Made available with sulfuric acid. 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  
HOW TO PREPARE AND FERTILIZE LAND 17 
If the place be small, one of these com- 
plete fertilizers would be more convenient 
than for one to try to mix them. 
When to apply depends on the need 
of the plant. Plants are most benefited 
when they receive extra nourishment 
in the early stages of their growth. 
For this reason it is often well to give 
the land an application of farm ma- 
nure and to apply some complete 
commercial fertilizer in the row. The 
fertilizer should, as a rule, be applied just 
before the crops are to be planted. It 
should be well harrowed into the soil. 
The commercial fertilizer acts as a starter, 
being quickly available, while the farm 
manure carries the crop through the 
season, the plant food in it being more 
slowly available. 
Kind of fertilizers to be used depends 
mainly on two things, viz., the condition ) 
of the soil and the crop to be grown. 
Generally speaking, sandy soils respond 
most freely to the application of fertilizers. 
When possible to obtain it, it is best to 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
138 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
use a farm manure, on account of the 
  physical help to the soil in aiding it to ~ 
retain moisture. An application of ten 
cords to the acre will cover the land 
one-fourth of an inch. This is a fair 
application, although market gardeners 
often use more than double that amount. 
A little additional commercial fertilizer 
in the row will be helpful on the start. 
Sandy soils are most likely to be deficient 
in nitrates, as the latter are soluble and 
are washed through such soils. On heavy 
soils also farm manures tend to lighten 
them. The use of lime on such soils 
(those which crack upon drying) increases 
the growth and healthfulness of plants by 
improving the physical condition of the 
soil and sets free unavailable plant food. 
Wood-ashes also aid in this, besides 
supplying the potash. The lime should 
be used fine, from five to ten barrels per 
acre. For light, spongy soils, high-grade 
commercial fertilizers are as good as any. 
| If the crop to be grown is an early matur- 
.ing’ one, commercial fertilizers are best, / | 
| 
/ 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  HOW TO PREPARE AND FERTILIZE LAND 19 
as farm manures are not early available. 
For medium and late maturing crops 
farm manures are much the best. The 
whole problem of manuring is a local one, 
and is best determined by experiment. 
Water is necessary for the assimilation 
of food. If the plants have plenty of 
food and no water, it is of no value to 
them. Tillage aids in keeping the water 
supply constant by preventing the evapo- 
tation of moisture by the sun when the 
weather is dry and by allowing the top- 
soil to dry out and get air when wet. 
Plants to succeed must have food and 
care; the most important is care, and 
care is largely tillage.

THE lessons in this chapter are given 
for gardens twenty-five feet long and 
ten feet wide, with rows running east 
and west, with the exception of Lesson I, 
which garden runs east and west with 
the rows north and south. They can, 
however, be adapted to any size and 
shape. Before beginning with the chil- , 
dren, the use of the note-books, tools, etc., 
should be explained to them. Note-books 
can be made, if a quantity is required, as 
cheaply as they can be bought. A note- 
book 8% by 4% inches makes a very 
convenient size for the pocket. The num- 
ber can be on the outside. The first page 
can be ruled for the month, day, attend- 
ance and weather report, and the last 
pages ruled for the month and day and for

GRAINS 
Grain is the term applied to the fruit of 
cereal plants or to the plants themselves. 
The fruit is a small, hard seed and is borne 
in spikes or ears. The grains are wheat, 
oats, rye, barley, buckwheat, flax and corn 
(maize). To preserve grains for school- 
room use it is best to pull them up when 
they are matured, but just as they are 
ready to turn yellow. Two or three 
stools should be bunched together, tied in 
several places to prevent breaking, and 
thoroughly dried. In this condition, if 
41 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  
  42 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
kept from mice, they will keep several 
years. 
Wheat is a grass closely related to 
barley and rye. It has a dense four- 
sided spike, and grains longitudinally 
furrowed on one side, turgid on the other. 
Some varieties have awns or beards; 
one being planted in autumn, the other 
in spring. From it comes the principal 
breadstuff of the civilized world. A grain 
in weight was originally derived from a 
plump grain of wheat. 
Wheat was introduced into China 2,700 
BEC, 
Oats differ from other grains in mode 
of flowering, having panicles instead of 
spikes. Used in human food and much 
used for horses, Often cut ‘‘in the milk” 
for a fodder crop,

GRAINS 
Rye differs from wheat in that the 
ear bends down while in wheat it is erect. 
It is taller than wheat, has both winter 
and spring varieties, and comes next in 
nutritive value. Rye makes a_ black 
bread and is the chief breadstuff of 
sections of Europe. A coffee is made 
from its roasted grains. The straw is 
valuable for mats, etc. 
Barley resembles both wheat and 
rye, but has longer awns, and it retains 
closely its husks. It has a wider leaf and 
43
-P-A-G-E-66
44 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
a more yellowish-green color while grow- 
ing. It can be grown over the widest 
latitude of any grain. The awns are 
barbed and poison persons of a delicate 
skin. It has two-, four- and six-rowed 
varieties. 
Buckwheat is a dicotyledonous plant; 
flowers white, fruit a triangular seed used 
much for poultry and for buckwheat flour. 
Flax is grown for both fiber and seed. 
The fiber comes from the stalks and is 
made into linens. The seed is used for 
poultices (flaxseed poultices), and is 
pressed to obtain linseed oil—the oil of 
paint. 
Indian Corn is taller than the other 
grains. Flowers moncecious naked ovules 
enclosed in a husk. Of great value as a 
food for cattle. Much used as human 
food, as. cornstarch and hominy. There 
are many varieties. It likes hot weather 
to grow.

It then grows rapidly. As the stems and 
leaves are so fleshy, the plant will often 
mature its seed even after pulled up. It 
easily roots at the joints. The small 
yellow flowers open only in sunlight and 
remain open but a few hours. The seed 
has very great vitality, being able to 
remain in soil many years and then grow 
when an opportunity comes. The plant 
is used in salads, for greens (as a pot herb), 
in pickles and for garnishing. It is very 
good. Itisoftencalled pussley. Difficult 
to kill, it should be uprooted and removed. 
Best time to kill it is when it is a day or

While it is not possible, and perhaps 
not feasible, for many schools to have 
a greenhouse connected with them, it 
is possible to do all of the things 
given in this chapter right in the 
ordinary school-room. The window- 
box or the window

teacher’s green- 
house. It may not 
be as convenient, 
but it may be of 
more value to the

they attempt to do things at home, because 
they have not the things which they con- 
sider absolutely necessary. Several of 
the greenhouse architects now have on 
the market a very fine window garden 
which can be easily put on any window. 
It might be well to take up one or two 
lessons with the study of the seed before 
beginning the following lessons. The 
  A SET OF SIEVES

sieves used can be easily made from one- 
half-inch mesh wire netting. A con- 
venient size is twelve by twenty inches and 
four inches deep. For Lesson II the one- 
quarter-inch wire mesh should be used. 
The flour sieve, for covering seed, can 
be obtained from local dealers.
-P-A-G-E-91
  Lesson I 
For Planting Seed: Take one part of 
soil, two parts of sand. Mix well and sift. 
Put the lumps in the bottom of the shallow 
box, which is called a flat. Fill it nearly 
one-half full of lumps or broken pots for 
drainage. Then fill the flat with the fine 
soil and sow the seed rather thinly broad- 
cast, one seed to every one-half inch of 
space. Cover about one-eighth inch by 
sifting soil on through a flour sieve. Press 
down evenly and firmly with a block or 
board. Mark the kind of seed and date 
on a label and place it in one corner of the 
flat. Take the flat to the greenhouse 
walk and sprinkle very carefully till wet, 
then place on the heating-pipes under the 
bench.* Coarse seeds should be pressed 
into the soil before covering.   * These, when treated thus, must be watched 
very carefully, and brought to light just as soon 
as the seed begins to germinate. 
65 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
Lesson II 
For Planting Fine Seed: Take one 
part soil, two parts sand. Mix well and 
sift with a one-quarter-inch mesh sieve. 
Put the lumps in the bottom of the flat or 
seed pan, filling it about one-half full of 
lumps or broken pots for drainage. Then 
fill it with fine soil, scraping off the top 
level. Sow the seed carefully over the 
surface as evenly as possible. Press the 
soil down firmly (not hard) without 
covering the seed. Place the flat or seed 
pan into a larger water-tight box, filling 
the latter with water. Let the seed stand 
in the water until the soil is wet through 
from beneath. Remove it and place on 
the heating-pipes or in a warm place. 
When dry, water from beneath as at first 
until seeds are well up. This method is 
used for all fine seeds, as tobacco, petunia, 
Antirrhinums (snap dragons) and the like. 
66
-P-A-G-E-93
  
Lesson III 
To Pot Seedlings: Mix one part soil, 
one part sand, one part well-rotted manure, 
and sift. Use one-and-one-half- to two- 
and-one-fourth-inch pots. Have them 
clean and dip in water* before using. Place 
a piece of broken pot in the bottom of the 
pot for drainage. Fill the pot one-third . 
full of soil, then take the plant, hold it 
with the left hand in the centre of pot and 
fill in soil evenly on all sides. Press the 
soil down firmly, leaving it one-fourth to 
one-half inch below the top of the pot. 
Place pots in a flat, water, and put in 
partial shade for a day or two. Mark 
the kind of plant on a label and place in one 
pot of each flat. To lift the plants, place 
the trowel or stick straight down beside 
the edge of the flat till below the roots, 
* As pots are porous, if they are not wet they 
will absorb water from the soil that the roots should 
have. With new pots this may mean the difference 
between success and failure.

then press the handle down, lifting the 
plants. Shake off the soil carefully and

grew.

   Lesson IV 
To Shift or Repot: Mix two quarts of 
sand, four quarts of soil, four quarts of 
well-rotted manure, sift and add one- 
half pint of fine ground bone and mix 
thoroughly. The pots are prepared the 
same as for potting, by wetting and 
placing drainage in them. The plant is 
removed from the pot by inverting it 
and rapping the rim of the pot lightly 
upon the edge of the bench. Crumble 
a little earth from the upper edge, 
remove the drainage, and crumble away 
the lower edge slightly. Put in enough 
soil over the drainage to bring the 
“ball of earth” about three-fourths of 
an inch below the top of the pot. Place 
the plant in the centre of the pot and fill 
in soil around the ball of earth, pressing 
firmly about the edges. Fill the pot 
to one-half inch below the top, press 
firmly, and rap lightly on the bench to

settle the soil. Water, and place in 
partial shade for a day or two. Never 
fill in soil above the first leaves of the 
plant. Use pots about one inch larger 
than those from which the plants are 
removed.
-P-A-G-E-97
Lesson V 
To Prick Out Seedlings: Mix the soil 
the same as for potting (Lesson III). Put 
the lumps in the bottom of the flat 
and fill it the same as for sowing seed 
(Lesson I). Begin at the left-hand corner 
farthest from you. With a finger or a 
dibble make a hole and lower the plant 
into it, pressing the soil firmly about the 
roots. Put the plants two inches apart 
each way and the outside rows close to the 
edge of the flat. Keep the rows straight 
and put the same number in each flat. 
Mark the kind of plant on a label and place 
one in each flat. 
aE
-P-A-G-E-98
Lesson VI 
To Take Soft Wood Cuttings*: Select 
the younger growth of the plants where 
the shoots are pretty well matured so that 
they are not too soft. They should break 
straight off when bent in the shape of the 
letter “U.” If they bend only, they are 
likely to be too soft. If they split, they 
are too hard. The tops of the shoots 
generally make the best cuttings. Cut 
them two or three inches long. Then 
trim off the side leaves and, if the top 
leaves are large, cut them in two so that 
they will not evaporate too much moisture. 
They should then be inserted in clean, 
sharp sand at least half their length and 
wet thoroughly. For the school room or 
home, a deep plate or a shallow dish con- 
taining about two inches of sand can be 
used, and, after the cuttings are in, it 
should be placed upon a radiator, The

at the bottom of the cuttings should be 
made with a clean sharp knife, and 
should be made just below a node.

   CHAPTER V 
Root-GRAFTING 
For root-grafting it is only necessary 
to have a sharp knife, apple or pear seed- 
lings and the scions. It is fine handicraft 
work, and can be done anywhere, in the 
schoolroom or at any convenient place. 
The seedlings can be purchased of any 
nurseryman for from six to fifteen dollars 
per thousand, and the scions will be 
inexpensive. One seedling will make from 
one to six root grafts. The grafting- 
cloth is perhaps the best thing to use for 
tying up the seedlings. It should be cut 
in strips about three-eighths of an inch 
wide for tying in the grafts. Any part of 
the root over three-sixteenths of an inch 
in thickness can be utilized in root -grafting. 
It is better to be six inches long, although 
not necessary. It is well to have the 
scions four to six inches in length. The 
77 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
78 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
roots should be thoroughly washed before 
beginning to graft, to remove all grit. 
Shoe knives of good quality make excel- 
lent knives for this work and are inex- 
pensive.

-P-A-G-E-105
   Lesson I 
For Grafting-Cloth: Melt four parts of 
unbleached resin and one part of beef tallow 
over a slow fire. Spread this evenly over 
cotton cloth with a brush or stick. Tack 
the cloth to a board or box, which 
should be warm. When cool, roll 
up and keep in a cool moist place 
until needed. 
For Scions: Cut the ends of branches 
or twigs of desired varieties. Cut off only 
wood of the previous summer’s growth. 
Label carefully and place (lying flat) in 
sand or moss and store in a cool moist 
place. Scions can be cut any time, when 
not frozen, after the leaves fallin autumn 
until the first of April. 
For Grafting-Wax: Melt together four 
parts of unbleached resin, two parts of 
beeswax and one part of beef tallow over a 
slow fire. When thoroughly melted, cool 
slightly and pour into cold water. Work

    Lesson IT 
For Tongue-Grafting: Take the seed- 
ling roots, which are called stocks, and 
the scions from the boxes of moss 
or sand and wash them. With a sharp 
knife or pruning-shears remove all 
the root branches which are three- 
sixteenths of an inch in diameter 
or more. Each piece will make a root 
graft. Make a long, clean, slanting cut 
on the upper end of each root and select 
a scion of about the same size and make a 
similar cut on the lower end of it. Cut 
scions about four to six inches long. See 
that the slanting cuts on the scion and 
stock are clean, smooth and match each 
other. Cut a little tongue in each by 
cutting out a small wedge-shaped chip. 
Press the stock and scion together firmly 
so that the tongues dovetail together. If 
they do not fit well, take them apart and 
try again. Be sure the inner barks of roots 
81
-P-A-G-E-110

and scions coincide. If the scion is

below the union and wind spirally till 
above the cut. If the distal end (top end) 
of the scion is cut, cover it with a little 
grafting-wax. Tie in bundles, marking 
the kind which is the same as the scions. 
Pack in damp moss or sand and store in a 
cool moist place till spring.

the stock; then make a corresponding 
V-shaped cut in the scion so that they 
match. If the two do not match per- 
fectly, try until they do. Have the scion 
about four inches long and place it on the 
stock so the cambium layers of stock and 
scion coincide. Bind firmly with warm 
grafting-cloth about three-eighths of an 
inch wide, winding spirally from below 
up over the union. Store in damp moss 
or sand in a cool moist place till spring.

-P-A-G-E-116
  88 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
For Veneer Grafting: Remove a shav- 
ing of bark through the cambium layer, 
about one inch long, from both the stock 
and the scion. Make a short transverse 
cut at the base of each vertical cut. Have 
the cambium layers of the stock and the 
scion coincide. Bind firmly with grafting- 
cloth, and store in damp moss or sand in 
a cool moist place till spring. 
A modified form of veneer grafting, 
called approach grafting, is used on plants 
in leaf. In this case the stocks and scions 
remain on their own roots until union 
takes place.
-P-A-G-E-117
Lesson V 
For Planting Root Grafts: Prepare 
the land by plowing or spading thoroughly 
and harrow or rake it so the surface is 
nearly smooth. If the ground be rich, no 
fertilizer is needed. Stretch a line where 
the first row is desired. Press the spade 
or dibble into the ground beneath the 
line. Move it slightly to increase the size 
of the opening. Remove the tool and 
insert the root graft, placing it in the soil 
well below the union, to encourage adven- 
titious roots from the scion and to prevent 
adventitious shoots from the stock. Press 
the soil firmly about it with the heel or 
dibble and continue, putting in the root 
grafts every six or eight inches, under the 
line. Put the rows four feet apart if to 
be cultivated with a horse and three feet 
if by hand only. Two persons can work 
to the best advantage, one using the spade 
or dibble while the other carries the

bundle of root grafts and inserts them. 
Hardy cuttings are planted the same way. 
If the row be long, the line should be 
pinned down in several places to keep it 
straight.

CHAPTER VI 
BupDING 
For this work it is best to grow a few 
peach trees from the seeds, which have 
been saved the previous year and planted 
either in the fall or cracked and planted 
in the spring. By September, the trees 
will be large enough and ready to bud. 
A few days before budding is to take place 
it is well to go about and trim off the leaves 
for five or six inches from the ground. 
This should not be done very long before- 
hand, as it will harden up the wood too 
rapidly. Budding should take place when 
the bark slips freely. Bud sticks should 
be cut from some well-known tree and 
the leaves trimmed off immediately, leav- 
ing about one-half inch of the stem of the 
leaf for a handlefor thebud. These sticks 
should be wrapped in moist cloth until

-P-A-G-E-122
94 HOW TO MAKE SCHOOL GARDENS 
used. It is well to procure special bud- 
ding knives, although any knife with a 
round point can be 
used. 
For “T” Budding: 
Make a cut through the 
bark about half around 
the tree on the north 
side and about two 
inches from the ground 
with a very sharp 
round-pointed knife 
Make a _ longitudinal 
cut about one inch 
long, cutting up to 
the horizontal cut 
already made. Open 
slightly the lips with 
the point of the knife, 1 Bud ster 
or spatula if you 2 Buds 
have one. Cut out a 
bud from the bud stick, putting the knife 
about one-fourth of an inch below the bud, 
taking out the bud with little or no wood. 
Use the handle of the bud to insert it into

the cut already made in the stock. Take 
a piece of damp raffia about six inches long

and place the centre of it just below the 
bud. Bring it around back of the stock,

crossing it again. Repeat this operation

the bud is inserted, so that the main trunk 
will come from the bud. All other sprouts 
should be removed.

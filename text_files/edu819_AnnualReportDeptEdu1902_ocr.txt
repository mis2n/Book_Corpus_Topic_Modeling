STATE SUPERINTENDENTS OF PUBLIC 
INSTRUCTION. 
The office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction was 
created in 1835, and by-an Act of the Legislature of 1843, which 
went into effect in 1844, the office was abolished. The follow- 
ing Superintendents were elected by the Legislature: 
Rozert H. McEwen, 1835-1840. 
Rovert P. Currry, 1840-1841. 
Scorr Terry, 1841-1844. 
From 1844 to 1867 the State Treasurer was ex officio Super- 
intendent of Public Instraction. In 1867 the office was again 
created. The following Superintendents were elected by the 
people, and served for the respective periods shown below: 
Joun Earon, Jr., 1867-1869. 
A. J. Tipron, 1869-1871. 
In 1870 the office was again abolished, and the duties devolved 
upon the State Treasurer, who was made ew officio Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction. In 1873 the office was recreated, and 
the following officers, appointed by the Governor and confirmed 
by the Senate, have served for the terms shown below:

The report of the State Superintendent of Publie Instruc- 
tion, herewith submitted, contains complete and accurate infor- 
mation with regard to the public schools of the State, State in- 
stitutions, State and County Institutes, and other information 
of interest to the people. Tennessee has not been indifferent 
to its own institutions; in fact, it has been generous to- 
ward them. The State has done much for the public schools 
within the ninety-six counties, but has not come up to that high 
standard demanded of it by the times. The one subject of 
paramount importance is that of money and an inereased assess- 
ment for public-school purposes. Massachusetts and other 
States have been compared with Tennessee, to the disparage- 
ment of the latter, and those unfriendly to this State have com- 
mented on statistics as presented to them. States with which 
we are now compared suffered least by four years of war, while 
ours suffered most. States like those are centers of wealth and 
manufacturing. They are the old’ States, established in busi- 
ness and finances, and it is unjust to Tennessee that invidious 
comparisons be made. County schools in Tennessee are not 
what they ought to be. They are the very best obtainable under 
existing conditions. People who criticise our educational sys- 
tem and minimize the work accomplished by it must ultimately 
be forced to the conclusion that more taxation is the answer to 
all arguments and all criticism. Tennessee has not made that 
progress and has not. shown that development in public educa- 
tion that a State of its resources of every kind warrants. 
The Legislature should realize, as it doubtless will, that while 
all powers are inherent in the people, the members of that body 
are representatives of the people; and the public schools of Ten- 
nessce are good or bad, long or short, upon the vote of that body. 
The General Assembly can give nine-months’ schools to the chil-
-P-A-G-E-21
SO Qe 
dren of all the counties of the State or it can let conditions re- 
main as they are. Responsibility for longer terms, better <al- 
aries to teachers, and better facilities for students rests with the 
Legislature and the County Courts. The Legislature must fix 
the rate of State taxes, and the County Courts of the various 
counties are responsible to a large degree for the condition of 
schools in their respective counties. It has been said that our 
system is not the best. That may be true, but the fault in this 
State is not with the system. We need more money. When 
the State, the county, and the civil district levy moneys enough 
te run the schools a reasonable term, then there can be but. little 
trouble with regard’ to the system. The States North, East, 
and West which have prospered in educational matters date 
their prosperity from the time when moneys were appropriated 
for public-school purposes, and not from the enactment of any 
specific law providing for any particular system of. schools. 
I believe in system in everything, but system is unattainable 
unless funds sufficient to maintain this system are appropriated. 
/Tennessee can have schools equal to those in the most favored 
States of the Union when the State desires these schools upon 
such conditions as they are given to the people of those States. 
We must realize that it is necessary, in order to secure the serv- 
ices of competent and up-to-date teachers, to pay reasonable 
salaries; and, in order to lengthen the public-school term, we 
must increase appropriations for public-school purposes. ‘he 
State cannot afford to oceupy either a backward or an obscure 
position on this question. It ought to be indeed a “ volunteer ” 
among the States of the country in education, progress, liter- 
ature, and every character of advancement. The people of the 
State cannot, in reason, expect a system of education equal to 
that of other States unless they submit themselves to a system 
of taxation kindred to those of other States. It takes money to 
employ teachers, and better salaries secure more efficient in- 
structors ; it takes money to provide the various means of oper- 
ating the public school, and the people must be taxed in order 
to support iH
-P-A-G-E-22
Soe 
oe all the interests of the people of Tennessee, the education 
f the children is the greatest. I believe in the strictest econ- 
omy in every public expenditure, and I believe in. the greatest 
generosity toward the 800,000 school children of the State, the 
hope and the future of everything that can come to the State. 
The care of the mind, the training of a child, the education of 
the young, and the development of a citizen are worth more to the 
' State than the building of towns and cities or the establishment 
of manufactories. The education, in its fullest sense, of the 
children of ‘Tennessee should be, and is, the paramount ques- 
tion of to-day. School terms will not be lengthened, teachers 
will not be better paid, the system will not be improved, noth- 
ing more will be accomplished, until the Legislature and the 
County Courts give inereased appropriations for public-school 
purposes. There may be other questions incidentally affecting 
the question, but the one thing that retards education in ‘len- 
nessee is the lack of funds with which to employ better teach- 
ers on better salaries and to double the terms of our ane 
The Legislature has been generous in its appropriation/of 
moneys for the maintenance of State institutions; it has been 
just and fair in its appropriation of moneys for the main- 
tenance of all institutions supported either in part or entirely 
by the State; and especially has it made liberal appropriations 
for the support of County and State Institutes and for schools 
of instruction for teachers in the State. 
The County Institute work throughout the State has done 
more for education than any other one thing. It has stimulated 
teachers, enthused citizens, and popularized the profession. 
The State Institutes located in the three grand divisions 
of the State have been more largely attended than at any time 
since the first appropriation was made for that purpose. Teach- 
ers realize the great benefit of this special training, and Super- 
intendents and Boards of Directors will bear testimony to the 
fact that the most competent and satisfactory instructors are 
those who attend these Institutes. 
It is proper that I call attention to the statistics for the pres-
-P-A-G-E-23
ESO Ge 
ent year. The total scholastic population reported to this office 
is 771,965; the total enrollment is 484,663; the average daily 
attendance is 341,537. This shows a marked increase over 
former reports. The school year in Tennessee begins at. six 
years and ends at twenty-one years, and many persons either 
complete the course or quit the public school entirely at the age 
of seventeen or eighteen years, or at least before reaching the 
limit of twenty-one years. For illustration, the enrollment in 
the primary grade, or first grade, is 131,351, while the enroll- 
ment in the eighth grade—or, practically speaking, last grade of 
our public-school course—is 7,852. 
Reports from all of the counties and many of the cities of the 
State indicate an increased interest in public education, and 
there is every reason to believe that the people will not only 
submit to, but will in reality demand, of the Legislature an 
appropriation sufficient in amount to give to every locality a 
substantial, well-taught free school. In view of the fact that 
the next Legislature will at an early date assemble in Nashviile, 
I deem it not improper that I make the following suggestions 
with regard to such action as that body should take on school 
matters : 
1. The school district and civil district should, by Act of the 
Legislature, be made coextensive in every county. All laws 
heretofore passed by the Legislature creating special school dis- 
tricts in certain counties or special districts composed of por- 
tions of two or more counties should be repealed. From making 
school and civil district coextensive, no injury could possibly 
result. Such legislation would simplify the system and prevent 
much inconvenience and many local disturbances. A careful 
study of conditions in the State convinces that large districts, 
with good officials and few schools, give better opportunities 
and more substantial instruction. 
2. School directors should be elected in each county on the 
same date. The law should be made more specific on this sub- 
ject. Either May or August would be suitable for such elec- 
tion, the latter preferable. The Act of 1899, which attempted
-P-A-G-E-24
ogee 
to fix a time for this election, was not specific, and much confu- 
sion and some litigation have resulted from it. 
3. The law should be amended so as to provide for taking the 
scholastic enumeration of children in the month of May instead 
of July. It is practically impossible, in the cities and larger 
towns, to obtain a correct enumeration in July, because many 
families take their vacation at this time; while in May, schools 
are taught in most places, the citizen in every avocation is at 
his real residence, and the OU Shas ean perform his work 
with accuracy. 
4. The law now provides for enumerating, as public-school 
pupils, all persons between the ages of six and twenty-one years. 
This makes our statistics misleading, and an unfavorable and 
unjust comparison of our statistics with those of other States 
is often made. If the law should be amended making the limit 
eighteen years instead of twenty-one years, no harm would re 
sult and our statistical tables would give a correct record of 
enrollment and attendance. 
5. It should be made the duty of the State Superintendent 
to prepare and have printed, for the use of the schools of the 
State, a course of study and system of grading. The law now 
provides that the County Superintendent shall prepare a course 
of study. This law is not enforced in many counties, but where 
complied with it naturally results in a separate system of grad- 
ing for each county. Under its operation a child may be prop- 
erly classed in the fifth grade in one county, while the same 
child would be placed in the fourth grade in another county. 
The State, through the uniform text-book law, has adopted text- 
books for use in all the public schools for a period of five years. 
Having uniformity in text-books makes the task of preparing 
a course of study and system of grading for the entire State 
an easy one, 
6. The law making it the duty of County Superintendents to 
countersign warrants of directors prior to their payment by 
County Trustees has been very beneficial, and has been a means 
in many counties whereby the Superintendent could protect the
-P-A-G-E-25
Cee 
school fund. The law ought to be amended, however, giving 
the Superintendent discretionary power. Many directors are 
careless in their expenditure of school funds, and often make 
purchases of furniture and school apparatus beyond the ability 
of the district to pay. An intelligent County Superintendent 
should have authority to supervise and pass upon these expend- 
itures. 
7. The salary of the County Superintendent should be com- 
mensurate with the important duties which he should perform. 
In a number of the counties $100 is the salary of the Super- 
intendent. That amount will not justify any capable person 
te discharge the duties of that office. As a result we have in 
such counties inefficient Superintendents or persons who are 
devoting their time patriotically to the publie service without 
just compensation. 
8. The State Superintendent should have authority to obtain 
from Superintendents and teachers every report and such. in- 
formation as is necessary for the proper conduct of his oftice: 
There should be some penalty or provision of some character 
on this important subject. Under the law, as it is, the State 
Superintendent simply requests and implores City Supevin- 
tendenits and County Superintendents to make their reports, and 
his report to the Governor has been delayed this year and every 
preceding year because of his inability to obtain the necessary 
information. All Superintendents are not careless or indiifer- 
ent, but many are; and the State Superintendent should have 
ample authority to obtain whenever desired, in a reasonable 
time, all necessary reports. 
9. The States that have desirable systems of education and 
those States which are making progress in educational matters 
have tested, with satisfaction, State examination of teachers. 
So far as investigated, I have not learned of a single instance 
‘where a State, having once adopted this method, has abandoned 
it. Hither the State Board of Education or a State board cre- 
ated by law for that purpose should prepare the questions and 
send them to a county board very much as examinations are now
-P-A-G-E-26
iG ie 
conducted for County Superintendents. Some inconvenience 
would, at the beginning, result on account of this change in the 
method of examining and licensing teachers. It would cer- 
tainly raise the standard of teachers in many counties and pro- 
hibit from teaching many persons who are not qualified in mind 
or heart, and will never be, for teaching. A State examination 
would work no hardship on the capable teacher; in fact, thou- 
sands of teachers would like to have a State certificate, which 
would enable them to teach in any county of the State. Under 
the law, as it exists to-day, no certificate to teach is good in any 
county except the one in which it was issued. A teacher often 
unexpectedly moves from one county to anothér, and is greatly 
inconvenienced by being compelled to seek the County Superin- 
tendent ‘and undergo another examination. Grades should be 
provided for the certificate which would ultimately lead up to 
the issuance of life certificates, and certificates for a term of 
years, for the capable and experienced teacher. 
10. The Legislature at its régular session. two years ago ap- 
propriated: £5,000 per annum in aid of State and County Insti- 
tute work. This was a wise and expedient appropriation. The 
work of State and County Institutes is important to the teach- 
ers and to the public, and it has grown wonderfully in. recent 
years. The Legislature should, without question, continue this 
appropriation. It enables the State Superintendent to do a 
character of work and reach certain persons and conditions and 
accomplish much which he could not otherwise do. The teach- 
ers of the State unanimously indorse this recommendation. 
11. The appropriation of $20,000 per annum to the Peabody 
College for Teachers should be continued. This institution is 
preparing annually hundreds of persons of both sexes to teach 
school. It is, in fact, in all its departments, a great training 
school. The appropriation made by the State, together with 
the funds contributed by the Peabody Board, makes it possible 
for hundreds to attend this institution practically without ex- 
pense. Many of the students, on account of a lack of money, 
would not otherwise be enabled to attend school. Four years’
-P-A-G-E-27
nO Game 
official relations with the institution, four years’ acquaintance 
with the character of work done in the institution, as well as 
that done by the students who teach after leaving the college, 
is convincing that this institution is giving careful and thorough 
training. 
12. The great trouble with public education in Tennessee is 
the lack of sufficient funds. Terms of schools are too short und 
teachers’ salaries are too meager. In order to get the best serv- 
ice, salaries of teachers should be increased; and in order to 
secure desired results from school work in any locality, the term 
should be lengthened. A school that is taught three months, of 
twenty school days each, by a teacher who receives less than 
$100 for his entire services, cannot accomplish much. We are 
far enough removed from the Civil War and the impoverishment, 
caused by it to enable the State and the county to levy addi- 
tional taxes for school purposes.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
COOKEVILLE, TENN. 
June 23, Four Weeks. 
Sir: I most respectfully submit the following as my report of 
the State Peabody Institute held at Cookeville, beginning on 
June 23 and closing on July 18. 
This Institute was held under the direction of the following 
Instructors: C. S. Douglass, Conductor; Profs. W. N. Billings- 
ley, of Burritt College; R. W. Jones, and P. A. Lyon; and Mrs. 
C. L. Fraley, of the city schools of Nashville. The Primary 
Course and the Secondary Course were organized at once, there 
being a splendid representation of cach course in the very be- 
ginning of the work. There was held one session per day, 
beginning at 8 A.M. and closing at 1. P.M., the plan of instruc- 
tion being both by recitations and lectures, with full and thor- 
ough demonstration upon blackboard, including the entire eur- 
riculum. 
Assuredly this Institute I readily class as one among the best 
Tnstitutes that I have ever held, resulting principally, I think, 
from the thorough indorsement of an able faculty, the cheerful 
codperation of the people, and the strong determination of the 
progressive and enthusiastic teachers to secure every advantage 
by which they might become more thorough and competent in 
their profession. 
There were enrolled 215 actual teachers, 15 or more counties 
being represented ; and the average daily attendance was splen- 
did. 
The day set apart for directors was certainly an educational 
“gala day,” as we had with us 40 directors, the entire County 
Court, and many of the representative citizens of the city and 
vicinity, our large auditorium being filled to its utmost. The 
morning was spent in educational discussions, school environ- 
ments, and the demands of the system, interspersed with vocal 
and instrumental music. Certainly it was an occasion of profit
-P-A-G-E-104
-—103— 
and of pleasure. We were also visited during the Institute by 
committees from the high school and the college, when two hours 
were spent in the discussion of the high-school question and the 
general outlook of the public-school system, all of which was 
enjoyable and profitable. 
Another interesting feature of the Institute was the organiza- 
tion of an Editorial Committee, composed of J. W. Bullington, 
Miss Susie Rutherford, J. B. Jared, Mrs. A. J. Chisholm, and 
Miss Fannie Clark. This committee did their work well, and 
to them we are truly grateful. The Cookeville Press and the 
Mountaineer extended every courtesy and proved genuine factors 
in the success of the Institute. 
During the Institute we were visited and entertained by 
Professors Yeargan, Griffin, and Thomas; Judges Puckett, 
Capshaw, and Allison; Superintendent Camp, Hon. Thomas 
Finley, and Hon. Jerre Whitson, all of whom did us much 
good by their strong indorsement of our work. 
We feel especially indebted to Professor Finney, who for one 
week taught so well the subject of United States History, and 
also to Hon. Rutledge Smith, representing the State Superin- 
tendent, who in so many ways gave us aid, being always ready to 
second our exertions in making the Institute a success. 
One very essential feature that we would not forget is the 
splendid music given us during the entire meeting by the or- 
ganized choir, consisting of Misses Lee and Martin, of Cooke- 
ville; the Misses Harris; Misses Rutherford, of Gallatin; 
and Professors Lyon and Finney. 
We feel that we cannot express too strongly our apprecistion 
of the splendid work done by our efficient assistants—Professors 
Jones, Billingsley, Lyon, and Mrs. Fraley—and assuredly are 
grateful to you for the selection of so strong a faculty. 
Tn conelusion, I would add that you acted wisely in locating 
the Institute at Cookeville. We found it to be centrally situ- 
ated, very healthy, and the home of a generous and hospitable 
people, who were ever ready to render aid and encouragement 
for the success of the Institute. 
Respectfully, C. S. DOUGLASS, Conductor.

RESOLUTIONS. 8 
We, your Committee on Resolutions, beg leave to submit the 
following report: 
Whereas the session of the State Institute, held at Cookeville, 
is now closing, and it having heen a source of great. profit as 
well as an occasion of much pleasure to us, and the citizens of 
Cookeville having spared no effort to make the session an event 
long to be remembered ; therefore 
Resolved, 1. That the thanks of this Institute be tendered to 
Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, the able and efficient State Super- 
intendent of Publie Instruction, for the deep interest he has 
manifested in the schools of the State, for his untiring efforts 
to better the educational conditions of Tennessee; that we havo 
felt the influence.of his strong personality and wise supervision 
since his first term of office began; that, as teachers and '‘len- 
nesseans, we congratulate ourselves on the fact that our State 
has such an able, untiring, efficient, and faithful State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction; and we heartily indorse and 
commend his splendid administration. We feel that his untir- 
ing and unprecedented work for the school interests of the State 
during his ineumbency as State Superintendent of Public In- 
struction entitles him to the profound and lasting gratitude of 
the people of Tennessee ; and we tender him our heartfelt thanks 
for his kindness in returning the State Institute to Cookeville 
for the present session, for providing us with a most, excellent 
faculty of Instructors, and for the great interest which he has 
manifested in our work. 
Resolved, 2. That we thank the Conductor, Capt. ©. S. Doug- 
lass, for his able and skillful management of the Institute, for

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
JONESBORO, TENN, 
June 30, Four Weeks, 
Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the 
State Peabody Institute held at Jonesboro, beginning on June 
30 and closing on July 25. 
On Monday, June 30, the assembly was called to order by 
Superintendent S. C. Brown. After some inspiring music by 
the Jonesboro Orchestra and devotional exercises, Hon Baxter 
Taylor was introduced to deliver the address of weleome. In 
eloquent language, ornamented with beautiful imagery, this fas- 
cinating speaker delighted the audience and stimulated the mem- 
bers of the faculty to appreciate the grave responsibilities rest- 
ing upon them as Instructors. The response was given by the 
Conductor, followed by short addresses from his associates. 
At the conclusion of the opening exercises the Institute was 
organized by electing Mr. W. S. Squibb, Secretary ; Miss Daisy 
Boring, Assistant. To the careful and painstaking labor of 
the Seeretary and Assistant, I am indebted for tho excellent 
enrollment and other items connected with the daily sessions. 
The faculty organized by electing Mr. C. C. Justus as Secre- 
tary. To his untiring efforts in making out the records of ex- 
aminations I am under many obligations. 
The sessions opened each day at 9 A.M. and 1:30 P.M., and 
closed at 11:30 A.M. and 3:30 P.M. A regular programme 
was followed each day, with some changes at intervals to vary 
the interest and to give recreation. At various times the mo- 
notony of regularity was diversified with music, recitations, and 
addresses from citizens and visitors attending the sessions. 
From the opening of the Institute all through the meetings 
until the last day interest and enthusiasm controlled the vital 
forces, inculeating a spirit of investigation and a desire for a 
higher plane of living and of knowledge. 
The Institute celebrated the “Glorious Fourth ” in regular
-P-A-G-E-114
—lis— 
work, with the addition of an impressive address by Judge New- 
ton Hucker. The Judge has always been ready and willing to 
respond to any calls made upon him by the Institute. In that 
way he has contributed largely to the success of the Institute. 
My associates—Messrs. Matney, Justus, and Brown—have 
labored carnestly and faithfully to make our sessions entertain- 
ing and instructive. To them is due the credit of having meet- 
ings every day that were full of the spirit of teaching, of ardor 
for the cause of education. Our relations have been exceedingly 
pleasant. I cannot speak too highly of the labors of my asso- 
ciates, of their courteous bearing toward myself and all the 
teachers. They have won for themselves a place in the hearts of 
all members of the Institute and of all visitors. 
On Tuesday, July 15, the Honorable County Court of Wash- 
ington County visited the Institute in a body. In response to 
invitations the members of the court addressed the teachers with 
encouraging words. 
On Friday, July 18, the directors met to discuss interesting 
questions pertaining to school work. 
To the enjoyment derived from both of these meetings the 
Institute is indebted to Superintendent S. W. Murray. With- 
out his codperation, his irrepressible energy and interest, the 
sessions would have been failures. 
In conclusion, I wish to add that your efforts to build up the 
“waste places,” to help those who help themselves, have been 
appreciated not only by the teachers and citizens of Washing- 
ton County, but by all the people of Upper East Tennessee.

Very respectfully, 
CHARLES MASON, Conductor. Pilot Knob 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
We, your committee, beg to submit the following resolutions: 
We tender our sincere thanks to our most excellent State 
Superintendent, IIon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, for giving Jones- 
boro the State Peabody Institute again and for the faculty— 
Messrs. Mason, Matney, Brown, and Justus—who have so faith- 
fully performed their several duties. As the success of an Insti- 
tute depends so much upon the Conductor, we are thrice grate- 
ful to Superintendent Charles Mason for his skillful manage- 
ment, for his inspiring talks on “ Learning to Think” and 
“ School Management,” for his genteel courtesies to both teacher 
and visitor, and especially for his ideas of individuality. 
Next to the Conductor we are indebted to Superintendent S. 
W. Murray, whose active codperation with the faculty and 
wholesome influence upon the teachers have been so helpfully 
and efficiently bestowed. We will remember him with interest 
in connection with the State Institute at Jonesboro. 
To Secretary William S. Squibb and his Assistant, Miss Daisy 
Boring, we render our acknowledgment of many painstaking 
courtesies. 
The Southern Railway is entitled to our generous good wishes 
in consideration of one and one-third fare rates. 
As music is the refining alchemy of life, as well as the indis- 
pensable savor of Institutes, we most graciously thark Misses 
Pauline Bachman and Monnie Osborne, pianists, and Prof. J.
-P-A-G-E-119
—lis— 
T. Pope, director, for perfection in duty; also the Jonesboro 
Orchestra for soul-stirring selections. 
We were led to elysian fields of intellectual life in the ad- 
dress of welcome, and afterwards by an‘impromptu address, of 
Hon. Baxter Taylor, the “ silver-tongued orator of the Nola- 
chucky ; ” hence our cordial good wishes for the handsome young 
East Tennessean. 
Profs. John F. Spence, of Harriman University; W. S. 
Bryan, of the Tennessee Normal College; L. E. Prentiss, of 
Athens; and John V. Thomas, deserve special mention for 
thoughtful addresses. 
The talks of the directors and Mr. Bryan’s matchless presen- 
tation of the teacher’s devotion to his calling on Directors’ Day 
were sources of gratification. 
We cannot forget the interest of the town as manifested by 
so many of its thrifty citizens, especially Judge Newton Hacker, 
who delivered an address on “ Educational Forces in the South,” 
and John S. Mathes, who delivered an address on “‘ Tennessee 
Ilistory ; ” by the papers for their ample recognition of our pro- 
ceedings; by the hotels in granting us reduced rates; and by 
the general good feeling and open hospitality. 
We most earnestly wish the County Court a successful pri- 
vate, as well as public, life, and recognize their close touch with 
modern progress on educational lines as evinced by their visit 
and.,their logical addresses on July 15. This and the appropria- 
tions for Institutes in 1901-1902 show the means they have em- 
ployed in bringing Washington County to the front in public 
education. 
Further, we believe that this Institute has done more material 
good toward the advancement of the best practical znethods of 
teaching and the development of the teachers than any previous 
Institute in Upper East Tennessee, and we petition in this 
paper for the State Institute of 1903 to be held in the historic 
town of Jonesboro. 
Finally, we remember with pleasure Mr. R. M. May for the 
elegant fans presented for our comfort; nor can we forget to
-P-A-G-E-120
—119— 
' be genuinely grateful to the pastors of the churches and to all 
who have combined to give the Jonesboro State Institute the 
largest enrollment of any of the Institutes of 1901-1902 east 
of Chattanooga. Respectfully submitted, 
FRED. V. CARTRIGHT, Chairman ;

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
JACKSON, TENN. 
June 9, Four Weeks, 
Sir: I beg leave to submit my report of the State Peabody 
Institute at Jackson, opening on June 9 and closing on July 4. 
This was the tenth annual session of the Institute held in 
this city, and it was pronounced by all to be one of the most 
successful sessions of the Institute ever held here. 
As has been the custom for many years, our city Board of 
Edueation furnished the building, paid all local expenses, and 
contributed $150 for the benefit of the Institute. They also 
individually gave it their moral support. I take this opportu- 
nity to thank them most heartily for their liberal support in 
making the Institute a success. 
The student body was indeed earnest and faithful in the dis- 
charge of every regulation of the Institute. The teachers of 
West Tennessee show by the great interest they take in the State 
Peabody Institute that they really appreciate this opportunity 
given them by the State to learn something of the fundamental 
principles of the beautiful art of teaching. 
The Institute was organized on Monday, the first day of the 
session, and was conducted upon the plan of a well-regulated 
school. We held one session daily, opening at 8 A.M. and clos- 
ingat1P.M. The afternoons were given the teachers for study 
‘and recreation. 
Sixteen days were devoted to instruction; four days, to ex- 
amination. Lach Instructor was required to submit his exami- 
nation questions to a full meeting of the faculty to be passed 
upon. The examination on all subjects was very rigid, and 
fully one-third of those failed who took the primary examina: 
tion. The examination was of a much higher order than that 
of a County Superintendent. 
The gentlemen whom you appointed to assist me proved to 
be Instructors of a very high order of ability. The entire stu-
-P-A-G-E-122
dent body was loud in praises of the very high character of work 
done by them. 
The commencement exercises were held on July 4. The an- 
nual address was delivered by Rev. Ross Moore, of this city. 
There were 27 Roll of Honor Certificates delivered.

proven themselves thoroughly capable, painstaking, and con- 
scientious. Their work was of a very high order, and it must

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
CLARKSVILLE, TENN. 
June 16 to July 11. 
Sir: The following brief report of the State Peabody Insti- 
tute conducted at Clarksville from June 16 to July 11 is most 
respectfully submitted: 
Immediately after your announcement of Nie each 
inember of the faculty was assigned his work, and came to 
Clarksville knowing just what he would do during the entire 
term of four weeks; therefore the work of cach Instructor 
was systematized to the highest possible degree, covering every 
important feature of each branch of study required in the pri- 
mary and secondary public schools of the State and leaving out 
trivial matter that consumes time without satisfactory results. 
I may say further of the Instructors—Messrs. W. L. Law- 
rence, W. H. Cook, and J. H. Bayer—that no Institute had 
more faithful than these and none did better work. 
It gives me great pleasure to state yet further that no better 
body of public school teachers ever assembled in any Institute 
than those enrolled here. From the moment each one entered 
he was an active worker. No groups were to be seen about the 
building or grounds spending their time in conversation. while 
the exercises were in progress; all were in their places and at 
their work. 
While the Secretary’s report shows that the enrollment was 
11 less than that of last year, it was larger than. ever before un- 
der similar circumstances. Summer schools and examinations 
in two near-by counties are responsible for the loss. 
No certificates of former Institutes were renewed, and none 
were issued, except to those who passed a most rigid examina- 
tion and made the grades required. 
While here the teachers were shown every courtesy any town 
could offer. The business men, as well as the citizens in gen- 
eral, did ae in their power to make their stay pleasant and prof-
-P-A-G-E-127
—126— 
itable. The newspapers, too—the Times-Journal and the Leaf: 
Chronicle—were especially helpful in giving important notices 
and printing the proceedings of the Institute. 
Several special lectures—one each by Dr. J. H. Lacy, Dr. 
Rt. R. Acree, Rev. T. C. Ragsdale, Rev. L. N. Montgomery, and 
Rey. R. L. Cave—were enjoyed by the members of the Insti- 
tute. Their subjects had been selected with the purpose of in- 
spiring and encouraging the teacher in his life work. 
At the close of the Institute the teachers voluntarily passed 
strong resolutions commending in the highest terms yourself 
for what you have done in the interest of public education dur- 
ing your term of office, the location of the Institute at Clarks- 
ville, and your good judgment in the selection of the three able 
Instructors you kindly sent here. The same resolutions uncon- 
ditionally indorse Clarksville as the permanent location of the 
Institute.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
MARTIN, TENN. 
June 9 to July 4, 
Sir: I have the honor to submit my report of the State Pea- 
body Institute held by your direction at Martin from June 9 
to July 4. 
The sessions were held in the convenient and comfortable 
building of the Hall-Moody Institute, the trustees of that insti- 
tution extending us every courtesy in their power. The citizens 
of Martin almost unanimously gave every aid and encourage 
ment to the Institute. : 
The first day was devoted to enrollment and organization; 
the last three days, to examinations. Except these, every day 
was spent in the regular work of the programme. 
We had the pleasure of one lecture from each of the following 
gentlemen: Prof. H. E. Waters, Prof. T. B. Loggins, Col. G. 
W. Martin, and Rev. G. W. Wilson. 
The attendance was the largest and most uniform that I have 
ever known at a State Institute, and the interest “ from start to 
finish ” was enthusiastic. 
The closing exercises were held in the commodious and beau- 
tiful Methodist Church, which was filled to its utmost. The 
Roll of Honor Certificates were presented by Col. G. W. Martin, 
President of the local Board of Education, after an. eloquent 
and able address. 
In conclusion, it affords me great pleasure to speak in most 
cordial praise of the zeal and industry of my Associate Instruct- 
ors, Messrs. E. B. Wilson, Fred. J. Page, and Homer L. Higgs. 
Appended is the Seeretary’s detailed report of enrollment, 
attendance, ete. :

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE FOR 
COLORED TEACHERS. 
NASHVILLE, TENN. 
June 16 to July 4. 
Sir: I beg to submit the following report of the State Pea- 
body Institute for colored teachers, held by your authority and 
under your direction, in the Pearl High School, Nashville, from 
June 16 to July 4: 
The Institute was called to order by the Conductor promptly 
at 8 o’clock on the morning of June 16, in accordance with the 
prearranged programme. Addresses of welcome were delivered 
as follows: His Honor, Mayor J. M. Head, in behalf of the 
city; Rev. Sutton EH. Griggs, in behalf of professional men; 
Mr. R. L. Mayfield, in behalf of the citizens. Responses were 
delivered by Profs. J. I. Watson, N. J. Anderson, and F. N. 
Green. 
The early appointment and announcement of the faculty 
by you proved to be wise and afforded each member an oppor- 
tunity to make the necessary preparation for his classes. 1 
deemed it best to call the faculty together at once to receive sug- 
gestions, arrange a programme, devise means, divide subjects, 
and attend to all preliminary matters that in any way related 
to the highest success of the Institute. At this meeting every 
phase of the situation was gone over, and every idea or point 
that tended to improve or strengthen the Institute received the 
proper attention. The thought uppermost in the mind of each 
member of the faculty was to make this the most excellent sum- 
mer school of methods ever enjoyed by the Nashville teachers. 
FACULTY AND DIVISION OF WORK. 
Conductor F. G. Smith—Geometry, Physics, Rhetoric, Geog- 
raphy. 
J. B. Batte—Geology of Tennessee, Arithmetic, Civil Gov- 
ernment, History of Tennessee.
-P-A-G-E-145
om yee 
J. I. Watson—Algebra, Grammar, Agriculture, Orthography. 
C. B. Lowe—Physiology, Bookkeeping, Reading, United 
States History. 
Prof. J. B. Batte also acted as Secretary of the Institute. 
Your selection each year of the Pearl High School as the 
place for holding the State Institutes is in every way satisfac- 
tory and advantageous to the teachers. It is centrally located, 
well equipped with school appliances; has beautiful grounds, 
large halls, spacious rooms; and is very near two of the principal 
car lines in the city. The air of quietness, refinement, and learn- 
ing which greets one as he enters this building has a very bene- 
ficial influence on the teacher. 
The attendance of teachers this year has been. most. gratify- 
ing. We can boast of the largest enrollment of teachers ever 
recorded in the history of State Institutes for colored teachers. 
I regard this as a magnificent indorsement of the work of the 
faculty. Last year was conceded: to be the banner year, when 
the enrollment rose to 256; this year the register shows a mem- 
bership of 300. Teachers have been attending this Institute 
who had never been to Nashville before. Every seat was occu- 
pied, and chairs had to be used to increase the seating capacity. 
The genteel, intelligent, and dignified appearance of the body 
was a source of much favorable comment. 
The Institute was especially favored by being permitted to 
listen to some very fine lectures by some of the ablest men of the 
race. Bishop Evans Tyree, Dr. James A. Davis, Dr. E. W. 8. 
Hammond, and others delivered addresses upon the race prob- 
lem, each in his own peculiar style, and gave the teachers much 
ground for hope and encouragement on this very difficult prob- 
lem. 
In addition to the regular faculty, the Institute received splen- 
did instruction from the following teachers, to whom we owe a 
large debt of thanks: Profs. H. A. Cameron, G. E. Washing- 
ton, E. J. Terry, all of the Pearl High School; Dr. J. P. Craw- 
ford, of the Knowles School; Miss N. E. Perkins, and Mr. J. H. 
Roberts.

From all indications, this will possibly be the last State In- 
stitute that it shall be my privilege to hold under your admin- 
istration. Your talent, service, and conscientious discharge of 
duty, all recommend you for higher position and higher reward. 
Permit me to say that I voice the sentiment of every teacher 
when I say that your careful administration has placed the 
schools on a higher plane than they have ever been before. 
Teachers are better prepared, parents are better pleased, chil- 
dren are better equipped than ever before. I desire to assure 
you that the admiration and esteem of the Nashville State Pea- 
body Institute are yours. In whatever field you labor, we wish 
you the highest success. Very truly yours, 
F. G. SMITH, Conductor. 
RESOLUTIONS. 
Whereas, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, in keeping with the 
precedent established by himself, has maintained the State Pea- 
body Institute in Nashville for the year 1902; and 
Whereas he has given us a faculty of eminent and qualified 
men, teachers by profession and adaptability, whose example 
is worthy of emulation; and 
Whereas said faculty—composed of Dr. F. G. Smith, Prin- 
cipal of Pearl High School; Prof. J. B. Batte, Principal of 
Carter School; Dr. J. I. Watson, Principal of Napier School; 
and Prof. C. B. Lowe, Principal of Clifton School—have given 
us inestimable service both in methods of teaching and in school 
management; and
-P-A-G-E-148
aes 
Whereas we feel that the teachers attending this Institute have 
been greatly benefited and have received ideas that are new, pro- 
gressive, and abiding, and which we intend to introduce in our 
schools; therefore be it 
Resolved, That this Institute extend to them our profound 
gratitude for their excellent work and indorse them as our fac- 
ulty for another year. Be it further 
Resolved, That since we learn that our worthy Superintend- 
ent, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, contemplates leaving this field 
of labor to accept a higher place in the history of the country, 
to which he may be called by the votes of his fellow-citizens, we 
give him up reluctantly, but wish for him unbounded success in 
his new field. RAPHAEL METCALFE, 
M. J. SUBLETT, 
J. W. M’COOMER, 
‘ Committee. 
Whereas, Superintendent Z. H. Brown and the Nashville City 
Board of Education, as a marked concern in our advancement, 
very willingly allowed us to use free of expense the Pearl High 
School for the purpose of holding a State Peabody Institute; 
therefore be it e 
Resolved, That we hereby express to them our obligations for 
the favor shown. 
Whereas the Nashville American, the Nashville Evening Ban- 
ner, and the Nashville Daily News so kindly and fully pub- 
lished our daily proceedings ; therefore be it 
Resolved, That we offer these journals severally our warmest 
thanks. 
Whereas, Prof. A. H. Wright, County Superintendent of Da- 
vidson County, lent us his personal codperation and influence in 
the prosecution of our work; therefore be it 
Resolved, That we tender him our grateful thanks and ap- 
preciation. Be it further

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE FOR 
COLORED TEACHERS. 
MEMPHIS, TENN. 
June 16 to July 4. 
Sir: The State Peabody Institute for colored teachers, held 
at Memphis from June 16 to July 4, was a success in every re- 
spect. I have never seen a more earnest, industrious lot of 
teachers. All the teachers attending the Institute came for 
business, and the result was that we had a business Institute. 
While the enrollment is smaller than it was last year, the ex- 
amination results are infinitely better. Everything this year, 
with the single exception above, #s an improvement on last year’s 
work. 
As a body, the teachers greatly appreciate the location. of the 
Institute at Memphis for the second time, and pledge their 
loyal efforts in the future to make it a success worthy of the 
State.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE FOR 
COLORED TEACHERS. 
KNOXVILLE, TENN. 
Sir: The Institute was successful. The attendance was 
large, and the interest manifested was gratifying. 
In secondary work 17 teachers were enrolled, and in primary 
work 34 teachers were examined. 
Addresses were made by Hon. 8. G. Heiskell, Superintend- 
ent A. Ruth, Exsuperintendent J. H. McCallie, and County 
Superintendent S. E. Hill. 
Superintendent Sam. E. Hill, of Knox County, rendered us 
invaluable aid by.his presence, advice, and financial support. 
He was with us during the whole meeting. 
A reception was tendered visiting teachers by the local com- 
mittee. 
Primary Certificates were promised those failing to secure 
sufficient grades in the secondary work. Three failed, but T 
have been unsuccessful in securing the three blank certificates. 
T have the grades of last year, and could easily fill them out.

The first week of the Institute was devoted to the discussion 
of methods. The discussion was conducted by Prof. H. B. Alex- 
ander, on the part of the State, and by Prof. G.. M. Elam, of 
Blaine, Ky., and Prof. W. L. Stooksberry, of Jefferson City, 
Tenn. A number of leading teachers visited the Institute dur- 
ing the first week. The last week was devoted to the examina- 
tion of teachers. The examination was practical and thorough.
-P-A-G-E-161

The few failures indicate that our teachers are up to the stand- 
ard and intend to make teaching a profession. 
The Institute was conducted under the supervision of Mr. 
W. B. Disney, then County Superintendent, and was in every 
way a success. J. N. CROWDER, Superintendent. 
BEDFORD COUNTY. 
The schools of Bedford County have made all the progress 
that could be reasonably expected of them. We have had 
three new houses built where there were old ones before. 
“Two schools have consolidated, and harmony has been secured 
thereby. 
I believe the teachers are laboring earnestly. The teachers, 
both white and colored, are laboring very hard to do their duty. 
We have two good libraries—one for the white and one for 
the ¢olored. Our Library Fund at our last Institute was in- 
creased $116.35. We now have over 500 volumes in the library, 
and the teachers patronize it liberally. 
The eighteenth annual session of the Bedford County Teach- 
ers’ Institute was held in the High School Building, in Shel- 
byville, on June 16-30. The officers were: W. H. Jones, 
President; W. S. Fitzgerald, First Vice President; Miss Es- 
ther Osburn, Second Vice President; Miss Estelle Moore, Sec- 
retary and Treasurer; Walter Thompson, Assistant Secretary 
and Treasurer. LOUIS WILHOITE, Superintendent. 
BENTON COUNTY. 
  
The Benton County Teachers’ Institute met in Camden on 
June 23, and was in session one week. The following offi- 
cers were elected: McD. Neal, President; Prof. C. ©. Vick,
-P-A-G-E-162

Vice President; Miss Metta Dreaden, Secretary; Miss Pearl 
Herndon, Assistant Secretary; Prof. B’ D. Johnson and Miss 
Pauline Brooks, Oritics. The Committee on Programme was 
composed of Albert Hassel, Ray Pafford, Inez Gibson, ©. C. 
Vick, and J. C. Bain. The interest increased from the start, 
and the attendance improved throughout the week. Our In- 
structors were: Superintendent McD. Neal, Prof. W. D. 
Cooper, and Miss Nellie T. Simpson, of Gallatin. Our enroll- 
ment reached 74. 
During the Institute we had some very interesting lectures ~ 
by several educators. 
We are very thankful to Hon. Morgan ©. Fitzpatrick for the 
interest he has taken in the educational growth of Benton 
County and for sending us such a proficient Instructor—Miss 
Nellie T. Simpson—who has given us much instruction and has 
made the teachers stronger. 
At the close of the Institute I examined 79 teachers, of which 
number 11 were colored. MW’D. NEAL, Superintendent. 
BLEDSOE COUNTY. 
I herewith submit to you my annual report. 
The Institute for Bledsoe County was in session one week,

by, Prof. M. M. Dossett, Dean of the American Temperance 
University, at Harriman. He was ably assisted by the teach- 
ers of the county. The attendance was unusually large, and 
the interest increased from day to day. From the general in- 
terest manifested by the teachers we look for better results this 
year. 
The Institute was highly favored by a lecture from Chancel- 
lor Spence, of Harriman. *

The annual session of the Cannon County Teachers’ Insti- 
tute was held in Woodbury, beginning on June 30, and contin- 
uing four days. The officers of the Institute were: James R. 
Preston, President; Charles T. Cates, Secretary. A splendid 
programme had been prepared, which was well carried out. 
The enrollment was 80; the average daily attendance, 75 per 
cent. Much interest was manifested during the entire Insti- 
tute. ’ 
We were ably assisted in our work by the State Instructor, 
Prof. L. P. Ford, of Gordonsville; also by Superintendent L. 
E. Summers and Prof. J. B. Clark, of Warren County. 
All the teachers present thought it was the best Institute ever 
held in our county. W. H. FINLEY, Superintendent. 
CARROLL COUNTY. 
  
The annual Carroll County Teachers’ Institute, after having 
been extensively advertised in the local papers and through a 
circular letter, met in the Southern Normal University, at 
Huntingdon, beginning on June 23 and ending on July 3. 
State help was furnished, and the teachers of Carroll County
-P-A-G-E-165
—160— 
responded to the call. They were eager to receive that which 
they have so long desired—a live, up-to-date Institute and a 
complete waking up in educational work. The Institute proper 
continued only one week, from June 23 to June 28; and the 
annual examination of teachers took place immediately after the 
Institute, from June 30 to July 2. The programme was ar- 
ranged early on Monday morning for two sessions each day— 
the morning session, after devotional exercises of thirty min- 
utes, from 8:30 to 11:45; afternoon session, from 1:40 to 
4:30. 
The Institute was conducted by Prof. Nathaniel Traywick, 
County Superintendent; and the Instructors were: Profs. J. 
B. Cummings, Superintendent of Gibson County; Nathaniel 
Traywick, of Huntingdon; and J. N. Williams and A. J. Smith, 
of McKenzie. 
The work of Institutes in this county has proved very ef- 
fectual. Teachers that were once deficient have been drawn 
out, and the work of inefficient teachers*has been largely im- 
proved. As we have but few secondary teachers in the county, 
our work was confined to the primary branches, the teachers in 
that department needing it most. Instructions were given in 
both the subject-matter and methods of teaching the adopted 
text-books, also in mental phenomena. The enrollment was 
good, being 117; and an unusual interest was shown throughout 
the entire Institute. 
During the week we had occasional lectures of great impor- 
tance to teachers—Dr. J. M. Carter, of Huntingdon, “ The Old 
and the New; ” Prof. J. B. Cummings, of Trenton, ‘‘ Tem- 
perance;” Chancellor A. G. Hawkins, of Huntingdon, “ ‘The 
High Profession of Teaching.” All of these lectures were 
largely attended and highly appreciated by every one. There 
were also two entertainments given for the benefit of the teach- 
ers—one, by the young people of Huntingdon; the other, by 
the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. 
The work done was very satisfactory. Only those who did 
not attend the Institute had trouble in making grades sufficient
-P-A-G-E-166
— 61 
to merit a certificate. Our teachers are beginning to realize 
that Institute work is a vital necessity for success in the school- 
room, and that the few days spent each year are more than re- 
paid by appreciation of parents and students for good work 
done all over the county. 
I am proud to state that Carroll County is on the upward 
tendency in educational developments; and, with few exceptions, 
the teachers of the county are able to cope with the teachers 
of adjoining counties.

The annual Institute for Carroll County colored teachers met 
in Huntingdon, beginning on June 80 and ending on July 5. 
A programme was arranged, and Rey. James Edwards, of the 
Huntingdon Public School, was chosen chairman, and Prof. 
C. H. Buck, of the MeKenzie Public School, was made floor 
manager. Under the leadership of these two excellent col- 
ored teachers the Institute moved prosperously and with success. 
The total enrollment was 38, and the average daily attend- 
ance was greater than it had ever been in the county. A greater 
interest was shown on. the part of every one than had ever been 
known heretofore. ‘The teachers are giving better satisfaction 
in the schoolroom since Institute work has been begun in. the 
county. 
The last two days were spent in examinations, during which 
tisne 43 took the examination and 40 were awarded certificates. 
I have issued 35 Primary Certificates and 5 Secondary Cer- 
tificates.

CARTER COUNTY. 
Our County Normal was held in July. We think we had 
the most successful meeting ever held in Carter County. All 
the teachers seem to be encouraged by the work of Professor 
Robertson. 
We organized a Teachers’ Association at the close of the In- 
stitute, and all seem to be better prepared to enter their school 
work this year than in former years.

CHEATHAM COUNTY. 
  
T herewith send you my annual report for the public schools 
of Cheatham County for the year ending on June 30. 
Our school interests are in a healthy condition, and we are 
glad to note the improvements that are shown by the figures in 
cur report and otherwise. 
An Institute and Training School was held for our teachers 
at Ashland City, commencing on July 7 and ending on August 
1. Our old and highly esteemed friend and coworker, S. 
Link, was Conduetor, assisted by Prof. M. E. Moore and Miss 
Kate Monohan. This is the first time our Institute has ever 
continued as long as four weeks. The enrollment reached 68. 
This is a larger number than we have had before, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that each teacher paid a registration fee of $2.50 
for the purpose of securing Instructors. 
An Institute of two weeks was held for colored teachers. Our 
evlored teachers are earnest, industrious, and fully abreast of 
the times. T. J. Clinnison was their Conductor; and two 
weeks, instead of one, proved a very wise step—and a profitable 
one, too—for them. 
Our first monthly meeting was an interesting one and well 
attended. One of the new features added to the work of these 
meetings this year is a course of reading and study in Southern 
literature. Prof. S. A. Link, a veteran student of that sub- 
ject, will have charge of the subject at the meeting in October.: 
I cheerfully exercise the privilege I have of extending to you 
the thanks of our entire body of teachers for your many kind- 
nesses to us, especially for sending Miss Monohan to be with us 
in our Institute. P. H. DUKE, Superintendent.    
      
CHESTER COUNTY.   
The schools of our county are continually growing better. 
The educational enthusiasm among the teachers, patrons, and
-P-A-G-E-170
pelts ae: 
directors is causing quite a revolution in the schools and will 
be productive of much good. The teachers are becoming bet- 
ter qualified; the directors have learned that. “ directors’ pets ” , 
do not suit the patrons and are not qualified for the required 
service. More interest is being taken in Institute work, and 
I am holding Institutes in all the districts where interest. is lack- 
ing. I find them the best means of awakening patrons and di- 
rectors to their duty. 
Our annual Institute was held in the Georgie Robertson Chris- 
tian College, at Henderson, on June 23-28—said to have been 
the best ever held in the county. About 75 teachers were in 
attendance, and the programme was thoroughly discussed. The 
work was well done and reflects much credit upon all who took 
part. I was ably assisted by Profs. I. B. Day, ©. Brooks, 
A. G. Freed, W. B. Hardeman, G. G. Butler, J. W. Stewart, 
B. S. Smith, and others. A two-days’ examination closed the 
week’s work. 
The Institute for colored teachers was held from July 1 to 
July 6. The teachers were very attentive and enthusiastic. 
About 25 were enrolled. The colored schools have undergone a 
marked improvement during the past few years. 
The year closing has been very satisfactory, and I am highly 
pleased with the outlook for the coming year. s 
C. B. IJAMS, Superintendent. 
CLAY COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the Clay County Teachers’ 
Institute, held at Celina from June 30 to July 4. 
This Institute was the most successful ever held in this county. 
The teachers were very punctual, and an unusual amount of 
interest was shown. There was not a dull hour through the 
entire Institute. 
I believe that the teachers of this county will enter their work 
this year more in sympathy with the great responsibility that
-P-A-G-E-171
—166— 
rests upon them than ever before and with a determination to 
attain grander and nobler things hereafter. The central cause 
of our great success must be attributed to the brilliant work of 
Prof. W. B. Boyd, our State Representative. State Superin- 
tendent Morgan Fitzpatrick has greatly favored us by sending

W. J. CHERRY, Superintendent. 
  COCKE COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my second annual report of the school 
work for Cocke County. 
The general outlook is favorable, and we are putting our best 
efforts forward to insure success with our work. 
Our Normal Institute was held in Newport, beginning on 
June 16 and continuing one week. In that short time some good 
work was accomplished, and we have never before sent out such 
competent teachers as this year. We have flattering indications 
of a prosperous school year. 
A. S. WMAHAN, Superintendent. 
COFFEE COUNTY. 
  
Our County Institute was held at Manchester from June 
30 to July 4. Prof. Alfred J. Brandon, of Tullahoma, and 
Dr. G. Clinton Hanna, of McMinnville, assisted us in the work
-P-A-G-E-172
—167— 
of the Institute. We had the largest Institute and the besi 
interest of any Institute ever held in Coffee County. 
Our schools are now running, and all are largely attended. 
You will notice my report shows a smaller enrollment and 
attendance than last year’s report showed. Allow me to state 
that the falling off was caused by an epidemic of smallpox and 
searlet fever ; it should not be attributed to a lack of interest. 
We expect to do good work this year. 
C. N. TOWNSEND, Superintendent. 
CROCKETT COUNTY. 
  
This is the thirteenth report of this kind that I have sub- 
mitted. During this time many improvements have been made 
in the schools of our State. Crockett County has kept pace 
with other counties in the benetits derived from these improve- 
ments. The old log schoolhouses have entirely disappeared 
from our county, and now we have pice frame buildings, and 
in most cases they are furnished with comfortable desks of the 
best quality. 
Our summer Institutes are well attended, and the teachers 
are enthusiastic, both in the Institutes and in the schoolroom. 
Directors and patrons encourage teachers to attend Institutes. 
Our summer Norv’al was first-class in every particular. [t 
was conducted by the County Superintendent; and.with such 
eminent educators as W. A. Muse, W. R. Phillips, Perey Mc- 
Donald, Mrs. H. E. Austin, Mrs. Gussie Goodloe, Mrs. Lelia 
Cates, and other good school workers, it could not fail of being 
a success. Miss Martha Neal, of the Lebanon schools, spent 
several days with us and led in the discussion of spelling. We 
were highly pleased and greatly profited by her interesting lec- 
tures. All in all, our Institute was certainly one of the best. 
Directors, teachers, and patrons are all manifesting more in- 
terest in the schools than ever before. With a little more
-P-A-G-E-173
—168— 
money, in many respects ours might take rank with the banner 
counties in the State. Bells, Alamo, Maury City, Friendship, 
and Gadsden have splendid schools. There is no reason why 
any boy or girl should be sent out of Crockett County to prepare 
for a regular university course. Patronize home schools. 
J. R. WDONALD, Superintendent. 
CUMBERLAND. COUNTY. 
  
The Cumberland County Teachers’ Normal Institute eon- 
vened in the High School Building, in Crossville, on July 28, 
and continued two weeks. I continued the use of the four- 
years’ graded course of study introduced at the last annual In- 
stitute, but issued this, my eighteenth annual announcement, 
several weeks previous to the convening of the Institute, in 
which I said, in part: “ Our annual Institutes are the strength 
and support of our educational fabric, and the progressive teach- 
ers of the county are the pillars of the beautiful and symmetrical 
structure. To them is given the training of the thousands of 
children in our midst. The best they can give them is none too 
good. The demands of the present are greater than those of 
the past; hence the progressive teacher takes advantage of every 
possible means of more thoroughly learning child nature, im- 
proved methods of instruction, and the best educational thought 
of the age, thereby more nearly perfecting himself in the funda- 
mentals of his profession.” 
Several noted lecturers were with us on as many nights dur- 
ing the Institute. Our evening entertainments are always a 
decided feature of owr work. A splendid choir and several good 
vocal and instrumental soloists assisted us throughout. The or- 
der and discipline were of the very best. Roll call found every 
one in his seat, and the work was not marred by tardiness or 
absenteeism. 
The lecture of H. H. Ingersoll, of Knoxville, Dean of the 
Law Department of the University of Tennessee, was of a high
-P-A-G-E-174
—169— 
order; the lecture of Dr. Crowe, of the American Temperance 
University, of Harriman, was well received; the County Su- 
perintendent’s annual address was much commented upon, and 
his address on Directors’ Day on. “ Born Short” won encomiums 
from all. 
The general work of the Institute was of a high order, and 
our teachers—apt, enthusiastic, and progressive—go forth. bet- 
ter equipped than ever before for their work. Our schools are 
graded, and certificates admit to our county high school, the 
first one in the State organized under our new law.

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the schools of Davidson 
' County for the scholastic year ending on June 30. 
Our schools are doing well. The average attendance is bet- 
ter this year than usual. <A greater number of pupils com- 
pleted the Public School Course and received dipiomas than 
ever before. We have our work better in hand, so far as grad- 
ing and promotion are concerned. All things considered, I think 
our schools are in very good condition. 
A. H. WRIGHT, Superintendent. 
DECALB, COUNTY. 
Our annual Teachers’ Institute met in Aulden Rives Col- 
lege, at Smithville, on June 23. Prof. J. M. Hatfield was 
sent by the State Superintendent to aid in the work. The 
mecting was turned over to him as Chairman, with the follow- 
ing faculty: J. D. Rives, Sr., J. D. Rives, Jr., J. Stone Rives, 
C. H. Rives, J. F. Caplinger, J. S. Woods, and R. H. Lankford. 
There was a great deal of interest manifested in the meeting, 
and all the teachers seemed to enjoy the work. 
The interest in education in this county is increasing, and the 
standard of our teachers is being raised. 
We found in the person of Prof. J. M. Hatfield a congenial 
gentleman and an able Instructor, and we appreciate his pres- 
ence with us. 
Our colored Institute was conducted by Prof. J. T. Elliott, 
of Walden University, and was a success. 
J. E. DRAKE, Superintendent.

FENTRESS COUNTY. 
  
A Teachers’ Institute was held at Jamestown, beginning on 
July 8 and ending on July 15. Much interest was manifested 
by those in attendance, and we feel that lasting good was a¢- 
complished. 
The Institute is under many obligations to the State Super- 
intendent for the efficient Instructor, Prof. 8. B. Yeargan, who 
so successfully conducted the Institute. Professor Yeargan. la- 
bored under many disadvantages on account of the absence of 
“the County Superintendent, who was quarantined at Clark 
Range; but the enthusiastic teachers rallied to his support, and 
the result was an entire success. 
We are glad to say that education is on gaining ground in 
Fentress County. ;

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
  
The Grainger County Normal, conducted by Prof. G. Milton 
Elam and Prof. Fred. V. Cartright, who were sent by the State
-P-A-G-E-177
Se 
Superintendent to aid us in the work, met at Rutledge on July 
7 and continued six days. The faculty for the week’s work was 
excellent. The teachers manifested much interest, and were 
ready and willing to do their part at any time. Seventy-eight 
teachers’ certificates were issued. 
The schools have begun with good attendance, and success 
is promised everywhere. I am now on my first visit to the 
schools, and am well pleased with what I see and hear. 
We now have a term of five months in Grainger County, but 
are not satisfied with that. We need more money in order to 
hold our best teachers. We are making some progress, but see 
much room for more. H. G. FARMER, Superintendent. 
GIBSON COUNTY. 
Having long realized, as County Superintendent of Gibson 
County, the need of a training school for the better preparation 
of our teachers for the responsible duty of teaching our schools, 
and realizing that while our County Normal Institutes do much 
to aid our teachers, yet they are of too short duration to accom- 
plish the best results, I, therefore, organized a ‘Teachers’ Train- 
ing School for the teachers of this county and the adjoining coun- 
ties. My object in establishing the training school was to raise 
the standard of teaching by preparing teachers for successful 
teaching, by giving them an opportunity during their vacation 
to pursue their studies, to review the public school branches, 
and to study the methods and principles of teaching and man- 
aging schools. My object was to prepare teachers for teaching, 
and not merely, by reason of any short-cut, lightning process of 
hotbed stuffing, cramming, and packing, to be able to pass a 
County Superintendent's examination. Scholarship and teach- 
ing power, not merely a certificate and «a position to “keep 
school,” was the goal of my ambition, my foremost end upper- 
most purpose being to help teachers to better positions, to help
-P-A-G-E-178
at 
schools to secure better teachers, and to help school children to 
obtain a better education, thereby furnishing the State a better 
class of citizens. 
The training school opened at Laneview College, four and 
one-half miles west of Trenton, on April 8, and continued 
five weeks, closing on May 9. The County Superintend- 
ent was assisted by J. W. Meadows, A.M., President of Lane- 
view College, and D. B. Jackson, A.B., Professor of Ancient 
Languages and Natural Sciences in Laneview College. The 
total enrollment was 41, with a daily average attendance of 40. 
In the Primary Department 15 were enrolled; in the Secondary 
Department, 25. 
The last week of the school was devoted to Bose, critical, rigid 
examinations; and, as a result, all passed, 15 receiving Pri- 
mary Certificates; 24, First-grade Secondary Certificates; and 
1, a Second-grade Secondary Certificate. 
The work was very satisfactory; the results, very gratifying. 
I feel more fully convinced of the fact that.our teachers need 
more scholastic training for their work. 
The Gibson County Teachers’ Normal Institute for white 
teachers opened at the courthouse in Trenton on June 9 and 
closed on June 20, giving two weeks of review and study 
for the teachers. The Normal was under the supervision of 
the County Superintendent as Conductor, assisted by a corps of 
the most progressive teachers of the county as Instructors. Miss 
Mattie E. Wright was chosen Secretary and Miss Mai McRee 
was chosen Assistant Secretary of the Institute. 
The “ popular entertainment features ” of former Institutes, 
replete with ‘long-winded elocutionary exercises,” “vocal 
gymnastics,” ‘“ screaming solos,” “ dreadful duets,” ete., were 
eliminated, and the “ practical-school features ” were observed 
throughout the Institute. The teachers expressed themselves 
as delighted with the change, and the universal verdict was that 
this was the best practical educative Institute that Gibson 
County has ever had. Our teachers attended the Institute to be 
instructed, not to be entertained. Most of the teachers got more
-P-A-G-E-179
aa 7 
real educational benefit out of this Institute than out of any 
other Institute that has ever been held in the county. There 
was more real, earnest teaching and studying done than was 
ever done before in the Institute, the interest and enthusiasm 
never cooling at any time.

At the close of the regular sessions of the Institute the Gib- 
son County Library Association met in annual session and 
elected officers for the ensuing year, Prof. G. A. Campbell, of 
the Humboldt city schools, being chosen President. The Li- 
brarian and Treasurer’s report showed the Association to be in 
good financial condition, 110 volumes of new books on “ The 
History and Science of Education,” ‘“ Methods of Teaching,” 
and ‘“ Principles of School Management ” having been added
-P-A-G-E-180
—1i5— 
to the library during the past year, and still leaving a balance 
of library funds in the treasury. 
The Gibson County Normal Institute for colored teachers met 
at the colored school building in Trenton on June 9, and con- 
tinued two weeks, being under the general supervision of the 
County Superintendent and under the direct supervision and 
instruction of Profs. T. M. Stigall, of the Humboldt colored 
city school, and W. A. Lynk, of the Trenton colored school. 
Owing to the busy season in the agricultural districts, only 48 
colored teachers were enrolled. At the close of the Institute 
22 of these took the examination—15 in the Primary Depart- 
ment and 7 in the Secondary Department. Excellent work was 
done by the Instructors in‘ this Institute, and the teachers were 
' greatly benefited. 
Our Institutes, both white and colored, are very popular with 
the teachers, and are generally well attended. The people re- 
alize the importance of these training schools for teachers, and 
they prefer teachers who attend the Institutes to instruct their 
children. Other things being equal, we advise our directors to 
give preference to Gibson County teachers who attend the In- 
stitutes. J. B. CUMMINGS, Superintendent. 
GREENE COUNTY. 
T am confident that the spirit of education is much in ad- 
vance of what it has been in Greene County for the past twenty 
years. 
I held our annual Institute for the colored teachers the last 
week in June, and every teacher was in attendance. These 
teachers are improving very fast and do good work in their 
schools as teachers. 
We had a summer training school at Ottway, in this county, 
conducted by Profs. E. F. Goddard, of Sevierville, and S. H. 
Thompson, of Chuckey City, which ran ten weeks. They had
-P-A-G-E-181
—176— 
a class of 22 young teachers, who made a splendid record. ~It 
is our intention to keep up this work each summer until it 
reaches all of our teachers. 
I have the county divided into six local reading circles, which 
meet once a month for a term of nine months, doing regular 
professional study in four different branches. Our work last 
year was Gordy’s New Psychology, Tennessee History, Geog- 
raphy, and English Grammar; this year the course adopted is 
Physiology, United States History, Arithmetic, and Psychol- 
ogy. Each cirele has a chairman, a secretary, and four teach- 
ers set apart—one for each branch—and we will have one or 
two meetings in the county every Saturday for the next nine 
months. We hold examinations in: these branches during the 
first part of June. 
T held our county Normal from July 21 to July 30, inclusive, 
with an attendance of 150 teachers in regular work. I had a 
corps of ten teachers of our own county, with two subjects each, 
and the work of the entire Institute was the best of any county 
Institute with which I have ever been acquainted. 
A good number of our teachers took the State work at Jones- 
boro. This Institute did the most practical work we have had 
in this part of the State. Greeneville next year, please! 
On account of smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, and diph- 
theria, our enrollment was smaller in the county last year than 
usual. B. D. WHITE, Superintendent. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
  
The Grundy County Teachers’ Institute convened at Mont- 
eagle on June 2, in conjunction with the Marion County teach- 
ers, and continued five days. By previous arrangement we had 
advertised a teachers’ meeting at Pelham for June 12-14, and 
could not stay longer than one week at Monteagle. This caused 
our attendance to be small, only twenty-eight of the forty-seven
-P-A-G-E-182
ei gee : 
white teachers of the county being present; but the attendance 
ot these was perfect, every one being present each day. 
Dr. H. M. Evans, of Chattanooga, and Prof. S. L. London, 
of Bristol, were the Instructors. The subjects presented by Dr. 
Evans were Geography, Physics, Arithmetic, and Literature; 
Professor London taught Algebra, Geometry, School Govern- 
ment, and General History. Wath such Instructors it is need- 
less to say that the Institute was a.success. 
T also held teachers’ meetings at Pelham, Philadelphia (on 
Collins River), and Tracy City. In all, there were 54 appli- 
cants, 47 of whom were licensed. In the Primary Course, 17 
males and 22 females of the 46 applicants were licensed; in the 
Secondary Course, 6 males and 2 females were licensed, one of 
these being given an honorary certificate. There were 4 colored 
teachers licensed in the Primary Department. The total number 
of teachers licensed was 51. 
Two days were devoted to examinations at each of the teach- 
ers’ meetings. At each meeting the attendance was perfect. 
JEFF. D. FULTS, Superintendent. 
HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
  
The Hamblen County Normal met in the Morristown High 
School Building on July 7, and continued only one week. The 
attendance was unusually large and regular. Almost all the 
teachers of the county were present and took a very active part 
in the work. We had quite a number of young teachers with 
us this year. We were assisted by Profs. E. H. Moore, P. M. 
Manley, J. M. McFarland, and J. W. Cardwell. We had with 
us quite a number of noted educators. Among them was Prot. 
J. T. Wenderson, of Carson and Newman College, Jefferson 
City. Professor Henderson lectured on “Teaching.” Hon. H. M. 
Sherwood gave the Institute some excellent music. On Thurs- 
day the Teachers’ Library Association met. We had a very in-
-P-A-G-E-183
178 
teresting meeting and received several new members. We are 
getting on nicely with our library, having bought quite a num- 
ber of nice books, and have some money on hand. 
L. B. HOWERY, Superintendent. 
HARDIN COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my second annual report of Institute work 
and the condition of education in Hardin County for the year 
1901-1902. 
In July last I had 1,000 circulars printed, announcing that 
I would, during August and September, hold district educa- 
tional meetings in the various civil districts of the county for 
the purpose of advancing the cause of education in the county 
of Hardin and that the teacher, director, parent, and County 
Superintendent might more thoroughly codperate with each 
other in the great work. We began each exercise at 10 A.M., 
closing at 3:30 P.M. The forenoon exercises consisted of reci- 
tations, declamations, and speeches by the children of the va- 
rious schools of the district. The afternoon was devoted to the 
reports of teachers in regard to the general conditions and prog- 
ress of school work in their communities and to suggestions as to 
any needed repairs or improvements on the school buildings or 
grounds, followed by a general discussion of the duty of di- 
rector, teacher, parent, and Superintendent. Thirty minutes 
were devoted to a conference on school law, led by the Superin- 
tendent. From 6 to 18 directors, 5 to 12 teachers, and the 
house filled to overflowing with parents and children, consti- 
tuted the work for each meeting. 
The Hardin County Teachers’ Association has not failed to 
meet regularly during the year. In April the Association de- 
cided to hold a summer Normal Institute for two weeks in the 
Institute Building, in Savannah, beginning on Monday, June 
23. In due time the Normal Institute was thoroughly adver-
-P-A-G-E-184
ae 
tised, and the services of Prof. ©. L. Hayes, Principal of the 
State Normal School at De Funiak Springs, Fla., were secured. 
By the time of opening, everything was in readiness, with a 
faculty of well-equipped home teachers selected to assist Pro- 
fessor Hayes. For two weeks the work was carried on with 
success. Never in the history of the county has there been such 
systematic work done. The number of teachers attending was 
106. I offered to renew all certificates to those who attended 
every day and had made a general avcrage of 90 per cent in 
examination during the past year, and 16 certificates were re- 
newed. Of the 81 teachers who entered the examination, 61 
passed satisfactorily. 
I must say that Professor Hayes’ work was highly appre- 
ciated by all, and its lasting gocd can only be told as time re- 
veals it through work done by the teachers who were so much 
benefited by his excellent instruction. 
At the close of the Normal the annual election of officers for 
the Hardin County Teachers’ Association was held, which re- 
sulted as follows: W. O. Mangum, President; Alonzo Phil- 
lips, First Vice President; W. E. Gill, Second Vice President; 
O. L. Barlow, Secretary; Miss Hettie Alexander, Treasurer. 
The Association meets in Savannah on the first Saturdays in 
July, October, January, and April. Its other monthly meet- 
ings may be held in any place by a majority vote of the Asso- 
ciation. W. E. GILL, Superintendent. 
HAWKINS COUNTY. 
As usual, we held three Institutes in Hawkins County this 
year. The white teachers’ Institutes were held at Alum Well 
from July 14 to July 19 and at Persia from July 21 to July 
26; the colored teachers’ Institute was held at Rogersville from 
July 7 to July 12. Of the 133 white teachers examined, 117 
received certificates; and of the 14 colored teachers examined, 
13 received certificates.
-P-A-G-E-185
Aue6 
The white teachers’ Institutes were conducted by the County 
Superintendent, who was assisted by Profs. C. W. Davis, Prin- 
cipal of McMinn Military Academy, and W. T. Guthrie, Prin- 
cipal of McKinley Memorial Institute. As the State Superin- 
tendent promised to aid us some in our Institute work, these In- 
structors were secured, and we feel that our teachers have been 
benefited and encouraged by their presence. It is the opinion 
of our teachers and visitors at the Institutes that our work this 
year far exceeded that in past years. All the teachers were 
earnest in their efforts, and they responded readily when asked 
to take part in discussions, reviews, ete. The enrollment of 
teachers was large and the attendance was good. We had more 
visitors than ever before, and much enthusiasm was manifested 
in school work. I believe that Hawkins County is awaking 
from its educational slumber, and that it will soon be “ up and 
doing.” 
It affords me pleasure to mention the names of Professors 
Bolton, of Grant University; John V. Thomas, of Harriman 
University; A. W. Maim, of Rogersville; and Rev. W. M. Mor- 
rell, of Chattanooga, who were with us and gave such interest- 
ing and instructive lectures. 
We are working earnestly for the upbuilding of our public 
schools and are looking for a brighter day to dawn.

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
  
It is with pleasure that I submit a report of the eighth an- 
nual Institute of Henderson County, which was in session at the 
Lexington Normal College from June 30 to July-5. The 
Institute was conducted by the County Superintendent. Profs. 
J. O. Brown and Robert L. Sutton, of Lexington, and W. T. 
Pearson, of Juno, were employed as Instructors; and their in- 
struction was of great benefit, both in method and subject- 
matter. Special credit is due Professor Brown for the excel- 
Jent manner in which he so ably rendered his part of the work. 
Miss Cora Owen, of Juno, was selected as Secretary and T'reas- 
urer, and she performed her work so well that she won the con- 
fidence and good will of the entire Institute. The 100 teach- 
ers enrolled deserve special credit for their regular attendance 
and promptness in responding to every duty assigned them. 
It is believed that no other county in the State has, according 
to its environments, a more live, energetic class of teachers 
than Henderson County. Several educational lectures of val- 
uable information were delivered from time to time through- 
out the Institute. 
Our schools, as a whole, are on an upward tendency; and it 
is believed that, with the enthusiasm and interest that. now ex- 
ist, our teachers, school officers, and patrons will not cease to 
put forth every stride possible until Henderson County is sec- 
ond to none in the educational work of West Tennessee. The 
Institute this year was the best and most successful of any in 
the educational history of the county. 
A. H. FULLER, Superintendent. 
HENRY COUNTY. 
The annual Institute of the Henry County teachers was 
held from June 23 to June 28. The first annual examina- 
tion was held on the last two days—June 27, 28. In every par-
-P-A-G-E-188
—183— 
ticular the work of the Institute indicated growing and gen- 
uine improvement, both in the quality of the teachers and in 
the conduct of the schools. The attendance was wholly satis- 
factory. The total number enrolled was 93—males, 28; fe- 
males, 65. At first this record does not appear as excellent as 
that of 1901; but when considered in connection with the fact 
that 27 teachers were absent from the county taking special 
training, it will be seen that it is the best record along profes- 
sional lines that the teachers of the county have yet made.. Of 
the 27 teachers that were absent, 16 attended the Summer 
School of the South, at Knoxville; 7, the State Peabody Insti- 
tute, at Martin; and 4, the State Peabody Institute, at Jack- 
son—all of whom, I am sure, had they been at their homes, 
would have attended the county Institute regularly. More ap- 
plicants were successful in passing the examinations this year 
than last year. However, it has become well understood that 
not all who apply can pass the examinations and receive certifi- 
cates. This, we are certain, is appreciated by a large number 
of the directors, who are asking for better-qualified and higher- 
priced teachers. The salaries of the teachers for the scholastic 
year 1901-1902 amounted to $961.41 more than for the year 
1900-1901 and $1,573.03 over the year 1899-1900. 
Miss Butler, in her special work of primary methods and na- 
ture work, is most excellent.   
The Institute enjoyed two excellent lectures—one by Dr. 
Tra Landrith, of Nashville, on “ Level-best Living; ” the other, 
by Prof. F. W. Cheek, of Morganfield, Ky., on “ Language.” 
Other special, interesting, and instructive addresses were given 
by Rev. W. B. Jones, Miss Evie Brown, A. H. Lankford, Pro- 
fessor Baber, and others. Miss Brown presented the Teach- 
ers’ Library with 27 volumes of the leading pedagogical works 
of the masters. Her talks on Colonel Parker and his work were 
most interesting. A. R. THOMAS, Superintendent.

HICKMAN COUNTY. 
  
During the last week in June and the first week in July I 
held an Institute for both white and colored teachers. ‘The 
Institute for white teachers met at Centerville on the last Mon- 
day in June and continued ten days. Every teacher in the 
county who was not sick, and many from other counties, attended 
this Institute. .There was an average of 85 teachers present, 
and I know that I can truthfully say that more good was ac- 
complished for our body of teachers than at any former Insti- 
tute. 
Prof. Arthur ©. Minter, of Petersburg, and Rev. R. J: Craig, 
both did most excellent work during the entire session, while 
our corps of county teachers did all in their power to make the 
Institute a success. 
We have only 20 colored schools, yet our Institute for the col- 
ored averaged 41 teachers, and was the most beneficial in every 
way of any yet held. 
TI held a written examination at the end of each of these In- 
stitutes, at which about two-thirds of the white teachers and 
about one-half of the colored teachers made grades sufficient to 
secure a certificate. 
Although I missed the help which you so kindly furnished 
me for two years, I feel that our Institute was one of the best 
held in the State. I should indeed have been proud for you to 
have seen our full body of teachers. In point of intelligence 
and good looks I challenge the whole State. 
ROBERT S. BALLOW, Superintendent. 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
  
Our Institute was held at Erin, beginning on June 9 and 
closing on June 20. The Institute was conducted by Prof. T. 
B. Loggins, of Dickson. The work of the Institute was inter- 
esting during the entire time. Professor Loggins, with his
-P-A-G-E-190
—185— 
assistants, gave the teachers regular class work, and all seemed 
to take hold and make each recitation and lecture hour pleas- 
ant. The teachers went to their schools this year well qualitied 
_ for their work, and I feel that the educational interest is grow- 
ing. 
A joint Institute for the colored teachers of this county and 
Stewart County was held at Erin from June 16 to June 20, 
which was conducted by J. W. Bell, colored. Superintendent 
J. I. Allman, of Stewart County, and I visited their Institute 
and assisted in the work. It was a decided success, and splendid 
interest was manifested. Stewart County was well represented. 
D. J. WAULAY, Superintendent. 
  JACKSON COUNTY. 
  
We have been troubled with scarlatina, but not like last year. 
I found all the schools satisfactory, except six, two of which 
were vacant, and the other four were sparsely attended. Fur- 
thermore, the schools started with an unusually large enrollment, 
larger than has ever been known before. I was informed by 
teachers and patrons that the reason of the sparse attendance of 
the four schools mentioned was scarlatina or foddering. 
We are in favor of a compulsory school law, and will work 
for it. We think that such would silence the indifference of 
“old fogies ” in regard to sending their children to school.

Our regular Summer Institute was held in Maury Academy, 
at Dandridge, from July 7 to July 11,-inclusive. The Insti- 
tute was largely attended from the first, especially so as some 
of our teachers were in attendance upon the Summer School at 
the University of Tennessee, at Knoxville. I was ably assisteu 
in the Institute by Prof. John Neuhardt, President of the Chat- 
tanooga Normal University, and also by Prof. J. F. Sharp and 
Miss Rozee R. Rankin. The Institute was conducted in a 
practical and original manner. A special effort was made to 
draw out the teachers; and, as a consequence, the interest and 
enthusiasm in the work were manifest throughout the entire 
week. 
The very able lectures given on two nights of the week—one, 
by Hon. EF. T. Sanford, of Knoxville, on “ The Convention that 
Made a Nation; ” the other, by Rev. J. G. Newman, of Mary- 
ville College, on “ The Making of a Man from the Stump ”— 
were a special feature of interest in connection with the Insti-

I herewith submit my annual report for the year ending on 
June 30. 
We have had a very good school year, and much progress has 
been made. 
In June we held a very successful Institute of ten days at 
Mountain City, conducted by Prof. W. W. Matney, Superin- 
tendent of the Greeneville High School, assisted by Prof. J. J. 
Hays, Principal of the Masonic Institute, at Mountain City. 
The enrollment was good, and splendid interest was manifested 
by teachers and visitors. The teachers are taking good school 
journals and trying to keep pace with the up-to-date methods. 
Summing it up, we have had a very successful school year ; 
and from the interest manifested by the teachers at the Insti- 
tute we may reasonably expect good, earnest educational work 
for the coming year. R. P. DONNELLY, Superintendent.

KNOX COUNTY. 
  
In obedience to requirements of law, the annual report of 
the County Superintendent of Knox County for the year end- 
ing on June 30 is most respectfully submitted. 
Beginning on June 19 and continuing until July 31, the Sum- 
mer School of the South was in session at the University of Ten- 
nessee, at Knoxville. The preparation which had been made 
by the management of this school for the training of Southern 
teachers and the development of Southern schools surpassed 
anything of the kind known to the history of the Southland. 
In view of the length of term of this school and the strong force 
of men in charge, it was thought best to take the work offered 
there instead of running an Institute contemporaneous with the 
Summer School of the South. I am proud to report that 90 
per cent of our teachers were in attendance from first to last. 
The work of the school was so arranged as to permit the teacher 
to select his own studies. There were offered Primary, See- 
ondary, High School, College, and Lecture Courses, in. which 
most excellent opportunities were given for increased profes- 
sional growth and scholastic attainments. To say that this was 
done in a satisfactory manner is to express the truth mildly. 
There were enrolled more than 2,000 pupils, representing al- 
most every section of the United States. All of the teachers 
expressed themselves as being highly pleased with the result 
of the work done during these six weeks. 
The faculty of the Summer School of the South was composed 
of the best men in America. It was a galaxy of intellectual 
brightness. The student body was composed of the most pro- 
gressive teachers of the South, and was truly representative of 
the educational leadership of the Southern, States. From the 
very first the school was a giant. Its influence for good cannot 
be overestimated. A tidal wave of public sentiment for better 
rural schools—yea, a public sentiment in favor of better schools 
for every class and condition of men—has been produced. Of 
course this great gathering could not fail to leave its impres?
-P-A-G-E-194
—189— 
upon our community. To-day our people are alive. Believing 
that the time is at hand and that the opportunity is here for our 
schools to occupy a higher plane than in time past, we face the 
future with a feeling of confidence. 
For some time it has been believed that the city of Knoxville 
was getting more than its share of the public-school fund by 
reason of the fact that its scholastic population had been. re- 
ported too large. After careful investigation, I became con- 
vinced that this contention was true; so in the month of July, 
after finding that the authorities of Knoxville were not going 
to take the census as required by law, I appointed enumerators 
to do this work. The work has been completed, and there was 
found in Knoxville a scholastic population of 8,951, against 18,- 
077 reported for the year 1900. This reduction of 9,126 
places all schools on an equitable basis. As a result, the rural 
schools will receive more than $15,000 annually, which, in addi- 
tion to the extra levy of five cents made at the January term 
of the County Court, will enable us to run our county schools 
more than eight months. 
It is indeed gratifying to report these encouraging condi- 
tions. Our teachers are wide awake, public sentiment is 
aroused, and the day is not far distant when we eee enjoy the 
prosperity which is now already here. 
SAM. HILL, Superintendent. 
LAKE COUNTY. 
No Institute was held within the limits of the county this 
year. By special arrangement with the Superintendent of 
Obion County, our teachers attended the Institute at Union 
City. This plan proved better than holding separate Institutes, 
as a number of our teachers reside in the adjoining county of 
Obion. } 
The County Teachers’ Association continues to flourish. It
-P-A-G-E-195
190-5 
holds regular monthly meetings during the fall and winter 
months at different points in the county. ie 
The county is increasing wonderfully in material resources 
and population. Nor does education lag. The school officers 
appreciate the value of good teachers; and consequently the 
compensation of teachers is greater in this county than in any 
other in the State, barring two counties containing large cities. 
R. C. DONALDSON, Superintendent. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
  
The attendance of the County Institute was good from the 
start, the enrollment reaching 86 or 87 during the week. Profs. 
Hawkins, Sweeney, and I did all the work, each taking his part. 
There was marked interest from the start, which abated at no 
time during the week. JI remained until the last paper was 
graded and handed in to the County Superintendent. I found 
County Superintendent L. B. White to be a very pleasant and 
accommodating gentleman. Upon the whole, my stay at Law- 
renceburg was most pleasant. A. C. BIGGER, Instructor. 
LAUDERDALE COUNTY. 
  
Herewith I send my annual report. 
I think our teachers’ Institutes this summer were more profit- 
able to the teachers than any heretofore, and so think the teach- 
ers; but the appropriation for Institute work should be in- 
creased, and the faithful attendance at the Institutes should be 
made a prerequisite to a teachers’ certificate.

Miss Virginia C. Johns, who was sent by the State, came 
promptly and remained through the term. Her work, embrac- 
ing the subjects of Reading and Pedagogy, was presented in a 
manner that will enable teachers to make a practical applica- 
tion of them in their work. No subject required to be taught 
in rural schools is more neglected than reading, and especially 
primary reading. Miss Johns’ work, being devoted largely to 
primary work, will, I trust, improve the schools of our county 
in this important branch. 
Professors Stricklin and Sims, of Harriman, were present a 
part of the time and rendered valuable assistance, whieh was 
highly appreciated by the Institute.

LOUDON COUNTY. 
There are substantial indications of improvement in our 
county. My effort has been especially directed toward secur- 
ing better work on the part of the teachers. 
Our Normal of two weeks, with the help of Superintendent 
J. E. Willis, of Monroe County, was a great success. 
My examinations have been such as to leave out those who 
were not qualified. Our schools need closer supervision than 
I have been able to give for the salary. The standard of qual- 
ification has been raised, which seems to have had a good result 
on the schools. Poor attendance is a great menace to school in- 
terest. It is distressing to find only a half dozen pupils at 
school. It is also distressing to find forty bright faces turned 
to a person for instruction and guidance who is untaught him- 
self, both in theory and practice, in the work he assumes. A 
compulsory school law is our only hope—I mean one to compel 
attendance ; but this seems hard with our present facilities. The 
law, if properly executed, would force improvement in teachers 
and houses. J. G. LOWE, Superintendent. 
MARION COUNTY. 
  
I herewith submit my annual report for the year ending on 
June 30. 
While the enrollment was not quite so large as that of the pre- 
vious year, the average daily attendance was better. I think our 
schools are improving in efficiency as well as in length of dura- 
tion. : 
We held our annual Institute at Monteagle from June 2 to 
June 20, inclusive; and while Monteagle is just across the 
county line between Marion and Grundy Counties, most of our 
teaching force attended the entire time. Superintendent Jeff. 
D. Fults, of Grundy County, joined us with quite a number of
-P-A-G-E-198
—193— 
his teachers, but remained with us only one week, as he had 
previously arranged to hold Institutes at other places in his 
county. Dr. H. M. Evans, of the Chattanooga Normal Uni- 
versity, and Superintendent L. §. London conducted the Insti- 
tute. With such Instructors, it is hardly necessary to say that 
the Institute was a success. 
On the whole, the educational outlook for Marion County is 
encouraging. D. A. TATE, Superintendent. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
The annual Institute for Meigs County was held this year 
in the Oak Grove school building from July 14 to July 18, and 
was in every way a grand success. There has never been such 
an educational interest aroused in Meigs County as was man- 
ifested in this Institute. Besides the regular cxaminations, 
live educational questions were discussed. Reviews were also 
conducted on each subject before the examination was given. 
The Institute was greatly benefited by the instruction of. Prof. 
W. E. Stephens, who was again furnished us this year by the

T herewith submit my second annual repout of the schools of 
Monroe County. 
The schools are improving. The teachers are more interested 
than ever before. They meet monthly in Institutes. 
. We had an interesting two-weeks’ Normal, with the best of 
interest throughout the exercises. 
The greatest trouble is too many schools for the funds and 
the low salaries for teachers. 
J. E. WILLIS, Superintendent. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
The statistical report of the public schools of Montgomery 
County does not in every particular do justice to the work done. 
Owing to a change in the Superintendent of the Clarksville 
schools, it was impossible to get a report of these schools, and 
last year’s report was substituted; also this was election year 
again, and many of our district directors were changed in the
-P-A-G-E-200
—195— 
May and the August elections, making it almost impossible to 
get accurate reports from all the districts. Hence in some re- 
spects the report shows conditions not as satisfactory as they 
really are. 
The corps of public-school teachers is better each year; and 
while the daily attendance is not yet what it ought to be, it is 
increasing. Last winter was one of unusual severity on rural 
schools. But for that the daily attendance would have been 
much greater. ‘ 
It will be seen that the average salary paid teachers increased 
from $32.10 to $35.64 a month, and at the same'time the aver- 
age number of days taught increased from 130 to 135; and, fur- 
ther, the amount of money on hand has increased from $25,- 
418.29 on July 1, 1901, to $27,643.41 on July 1, 1902. This 
difference would have run the schools ten days longer last year, 
making 145 as the average number of days taught, and then 
this year’s term would have begun with the same amount of 
money as that of last year. 
We also note more satisfactory conditions elsewhere in the 
work, and any deficiency is due to the failure of Olarksville to 
report last term. ; 
There are two County Teachers’ Associations—one white and 
one colored—that meet monthly at the Superintendent’s office. 
These organizations have regular courses of study and are in 
good condition. 
The State Institute located at Clarksville did excellent work, 
and the county very much appreciates the State Superintend- 
ent’s kindness and interest in the educational work of this sec- 
tion. The Instructors he sent us were faithful in the discharge 
of their duties, and their work was entirely satisfactory. 
In conclusion, it may be stated that many things encourage 
those engaged in public education. There has been wonderful 
progress during the past few years, but the progress cannot be 
what it would be if there were a careful and systematic revision 
of the public-school law. For example, the present system of 
having three directors in each district, with almost unlimited
-P-A-G-E-201
—196— 
authority, and the very frequent change of these, make the high- 
est standard of public education impossible. Some other 
changes of nearly equal importance might be named, but space 
here will not be asked for that. 
P. L. HARNED, Superintendent. 
MWMINN COUNTY. 
  
Herewith find my annual report, which is approximated from 
papers in my office. 
We had our annual Normals this year—one week for the 
whites and cne week for the colored; and we had the best attend- 
ance of whites that we have ever had. We were greatly bene 
fited by having with us the Misses Fitts and Peebles, of the 
Hartsville city school, who represented the State. 
The general outlook in the county, from an educational stand. 
point, is improving. The directors are beginning to seat the 
houses with good, comfortable desks; the teachers are making 
better preparation for their work; and the attendance for the 
present session is hetter than ever befoe. 
M. R. M. BURKE, Superintendent.

Our Institute this year for Morgan County was well attended 
by the teachers of the county, and good interest was manifested 
by most of those attending. Prof. J. S. Cline, of Crossville,

both did excellent work, which was much appreciated by the 
members of the Institute.

ing of the Institute until Wednesday of the second week, when 
the examinations commenced. I found the teachers of Morgan

of teachers. By their many courtesies and favors to me they 
rendered my stay in Wartburg very pleasant.

OBION COUNTY. 
  
Our Institute opened on June 23 and closed on July 18. 
Four weeks were spent by our county teachers-in pleasant, asso- 
ciation and in faithful and earnest work. Inasmuch as the 
success of our Institute is due, in a very great measure, to the 
able and efficient services rendered by those whom I chose to 
help me in the work, I am glad to affirm that our summer school 
was a veritable suecess. Oral and written work was alternated, 
the pupils being graded in the written work. No final exami- 
nations marred the pleasure or disturbed the equilibrium of 
our pupils. Each day’s work entered as a factor in the grade 
received by those desiring certificates. The fund frem which 
all expenses were paid was $100 contributed by the county and 
$2 from each one who matriculated. The enro!lment amounted 
to about 100. In the Primary Department 45 received certifi- 
eates—males, 11; females, 34. In the Secondary Department 
20 received certificates—males, 10; females, 10. Six Sec- 
ondary Certificates averaged 90 and up; 20 Primary Cer- 
tificates averaged 90 and up. Total number of certificates is- 
sued, 65. Taking into consideration those of our teachers who 
attended State Institutes, together with those who swelled our 
County Institute, it is no exaggeration to say that 95 per cent 
of our county teachers took the preseribed course in Institute 
work this year. We are proud to say that this record stands 
among’ the best in the State. : 
Prof. A. E. Darrah was our efficient Conductor, ably assisted 
by Profs. W. L. Willingham and Don. M. Milam. J. M. 
Moore had charge of Arithmetic, Geometry, and Rhetoric. 
We are grateful for the opportunity of doing our best to in- 
crease the interest and efficiency of our teachers. 
With an appropriation of $50 by the county and $2 from 
each one matriculating, we were enabled to hold an Institute 
of four weeks’ duration for colored teachers.

Frequent visits to the Institute convinced me that the negro

The South will be doubly paid by giving the colored race such a 
training as will make of them good citizens.

Good feeling prevailed, and great good was accomplished. 
J. M. MOORE, Superintendent. 
OVERTON COUNTY. 
  
The Overton County Teachers’ Institute was held at Living- 
ston, beginning on July 8 and continuing ten days. Prof. 
E. S. Brugh, of Nashville, was with us as our Instructor. He 
proved himself to be a splendid Instructor, making his work 
practical and such as was of much benefit to the teacher.

7 PERRY COUNTY. 
I herewith submit the annual report of the publie schools of 
Perry County for the scholastic year ending on June 30. 
Under prevailing conditions the public schools of this county 
have done well this year. Some of our directors are very indif- 
ferent toward educational interests. In some places the peo- 
ple, too, as well as the directors, seem to take very little interest 
in educational matters. I have found, however, that nearly ail 
of our teachers are working with energy and exhibiting a proper 
degree of interest in their work. The grade of teachers is im- 
proving very rapidly in this county. Many of them take cdu- 
eational journals, and nearly all of them attend school during 
the winter months. 
The Institute for this county was conducted by Superintend- 
ent L. G. Bunch, ably assisted by Profs. B. A. Tucker, of Scott’s 
Hill College; W. N. Tucker, of the Linden Training School; 
A. N. Daniel, of the Lexington Normal College; and A. F. 
Aydlet, of the Centerville Training School. There were about 
50 teachers in constant attendance—all who expect to teach in 
Perry County this year and some from adjoining counties. 
They manifested great interest in the work—more than ever 
before. The people of Linden cheerfully threw cpen their 
homes for the accommodation of teachers, and many of them 
attended daily sessions of the Institute. 
Upon the whole, the outlbok is very encouraging; and from 
the seed now being sown we are confidently assured that a much 
better harvest than hitherto known will be realized. 
L. G. BUNCH, Superintendent. 
POLK COUNTY. 
  
With this year’s and last year’s reports before me, I note the 
following: An inerease of 5 per cent in scholastic population 
and of 11 per cent in enrollment, which was cansed, in part, by
-P-A-G-E-206
—201— 
the starting up of four of the eight schools which had suspended 
terms to build houses. The average daily attendance deereased 
2 per cent, mainly on account of the average term’s being length- 
ened 31 per cent, the 24 days added being mainly during 
the winter months, when the attendance is at its low ebb 
here. The effects of the longer terms are shown in a substan- 
tial increase in the number of pupils in the fourth, fifth, and 
sixth grades. A further increase in the per cent of female teach- 
ers is shown. The average term increased from 78 days to 102 
days, and it would have been much longer but for three large 
districts unexpectedly cutting their terms to do some extensive 
repairing and building. The average compensation. of teach- 
ers climbed one notch higher. Ten new schoolhouses, valued at 
$2,685, have been added during the year. Eight of them were 
built under my specifications, and the other two are good ones. 
The value of school property increased from $24,892 to $28,603, 
and I consider it a low valuation. It is $5.80 to each child, 
or $550 to each school. One more Institute was held this year 
than was held last year, and the attendance increased 30 per 
cent. Our Teachers’ Library Association about doubled its 
membership, increased its assets nearly three times, is one year 
old, and has 53 members. The increase in the school fund is 
20 per cent, besides adding $2,492 to the sinking fund in order 
to keep warrants at par and have them cashed upon presentation. 
The fund will be larger for the next two years, if the County 
Court holds the present levy, which has stood for four years 
past. The per capita this year will be $2 or over, while it was 
$1.80 last year and averaged $1.20 for the six previous years. 
More members of our County Court favor increasing the school 
levy than favor decreasing it, but the majority desire to “let 
well enough alone.” i 
Now all of this may sound like the “same old song; ” but 
if I desired to injure our schools, I would write a book on our 
failures and shortcomings, perversities and difficulties, actual 
conditions and ideal dreams. 
Our Institutes held this year were the most largely attended
-P-A-G-E-207
—209— 
ever held in the county, though the attendance has been satis- 
factory for the past five years. 
Since leaving the Public School Officers’ Association last J an- 
uary, I have furnished the plans and aided the directors in let- 
ting contracts for twelve new schoolhouses. Of these, seven are 
being used now for schools; the other five are not yet completed. 
J. D. CLEMMER, Superintendent. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
The annual Institute of Roane County convened in Kingston 
on June 80, with Profs. J. P. Griffin, D. W. White, and W. 
D. Hammontree in attendance to assist the Superintendent 
in the work. The Institute continued two weeks. The first 
week was devoted to work along the line of primary teaching ; 
the second week, to examinations, ete. The teachers manifested 
a deep interest in their work. The attendance was very good; 
the attention, the best. The examinations were very rigid— 
more so than in the past; yet the teachers’ average showed very 
clearly that they have improved much in their work. 
I think our county is doing reasonably well along the line of 
education. The work of the teachers is very good. Yet there 
is a lack of interest on the part of the patrons. They do not 
send their children as regularly as they should, and I cannot 
understand why it is that parents are so negligent in putting 
their children in school or keeping them there regularly when 
once they have entered. 
We are doing the very best we can, and I think Roane County 
is moving onward and upward. ' The schools are opening nicely 
this year, the teachers doing good work. 
BEN. F. BROWN, Superintendent.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
  
The Sevier County Teachers’ Institute was held at Sevier- 
ville, beginning on June 23 and closing on July 3. It was one 
of the most successful Institutes ever held in the county. Al- 
most every teacher in the county was in attendance, and more 
than the usual interest was manifested. Profs. J. W. Trotter, 
and T. C. Dunnen, the Instructors, were very earnest in their 
work and spared no pains to give the teachers the most helpful 
instruction. We are very grateful to the teachers for their close 
attention and for the active part they took in the Institute work. 
An evening lecture given by Dr. L. E. Prentis on “ How the 
American Boy May Succeed ” was very inspiring and helpful 
to all who heard it. 
The outlook for our schools is better than ever before. The 
teachers are taking more interest in professional reading. Al- 
most all of them belong to the Library Association, and they 
seem to be interested in self-improvement. 
This year each teacher is to observe one Friday afternoon as 
“ Parents’ Day.” The efforts of the teachers in these meet- 
ings will be to arouse public sentiment in*favor of better schools, 
more regular attendance, and longer terms.

SHELBY COUNTY. 
  
The Shelby County Normal Institute was held in the Belle- 
vue Female College building, at Collierville, beginning on Sep-
-P-A-G-E-209
7a 
tember 1 and continuing two weeks. The County Court ap- 
propriated $300 for this Institute, every teacher in regular at- 
tendance paid a membership fee of $1, the Tenth District School 
Board gave the use of the Bellevue College building without 
money and without price, and the town of Collierville contrib- 
uted $50 for incidental expenses. From these sources an am- _ 
ple fund was secured to meet all expenses. The Institute was 
conducted on the department plan, a Primary Course and a 
Secondary Course being carried on at the same time. By this 
plan we accomplished as much in morning sessions only as could 
possibly have been accomplished in all-day sessions by the one- 
leeture-a-period programme. There were enrolled 80 teachers 
as members, not including the faculty of 7; and a number of 
visitors attended the sessions daily. Among the distinguished 
visitors who favored us with addresses or lectures were: Mr. 
P. P. Claxton, of Knoxville, and Judge J. B. Heiskell, Prof. 
W. S. Jones, and Dr. G. G. Buford, of Memphis. Prof. G. A. 
Lewellen, of Collierville, gave several interesting talks on phys- 
ics, illustrating them by experiments. 
Another new feature of our Institute was a stereopticon lec- 
ture course, which was conducted by Dr. Buford and Prof. 
Tiarry R. Fulton, of Oxford, Miss. This course was given in 
the evenings, throughout one week, to large crowds of the teach- 
ers and townspeople, and proved to be a valuable addition to the 
Institute course of study. 
On September 12 an examination of the members of the 
Shelby County Teachers’ Reading Circle on the subjects of the 
Reading Course for 1901-1902 (General History and Psychol- 
ogy) was held by the County Superintendent. Reading Circle 
Certificates were issued to those attaining an average of 85 per 
cent, and the holders of these certificates will be exempt from 
further examinations in Shelby County for a period of one year. 
No other examination was given during the Institute. Before 
the close of the regular work on Thursday morning a half-hour’s 
experience meeting was held.

STEWART COUNTY. 
  
Stewart County is still improving along school lines. We had 
a one-weck’s Institute, conducted by the County Superintend- 
ent, in which subjects relating to the educational advancement 
of the county were discussed. Certain improvements were de- 
cided upon for this year, among them being the establishment
-P-A-G-E-211
——206—— 
of a library in every school, an improvement in our grading, 
and an increased effort for better and more regular attendance. 
A large per cent of our teachers attended the State Institute, 
and Stewart County had in attendance at the State Teachers’ 
Association the largest delegation of any county in the State. 
Our monthly teachers’ meetings are still going on, and they 
are doing a great deal for the teachers of the county. 
Our library is still growing, and we now have a great many 
of the best books for teachers extant. 
We are expecting this to be the most successful year with us 
along school lines. J. I. ALLMAN, Superintendent. 
SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
  
LT herewith submit my annual report for 1901-1902. 
Our school affairs are still in good shape. No backward 
steps are permitted. 
Our annual Normal was a most successful one. With a very 
few exceptions, all our teachers were in attendance. Prof. 
Charles Mason gave us much food for thought and inspiration 
for action by his splendid instruction. Prof. R. E. Wolfe and 
Miss Rachel Fain assisted us again this year most ably and ac- 
ceptably. Valuable aid was also given by Messrs. Theo. Culp, 
J. K. Shipley, N. B. Sherfey, R. M. Shank, W. H. Grisler, and 
others. At the close of the Institute all Sullivan County teach- 
ers, save six, were ruled to a written examination. 
J. E. L. SENEKER, Superintendent. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
Education is on an upward tendency in Sumner County. 
Our people are taking more interest in education. 
Our annual Teachers’ Institute for Sumner County met. at
-P-A-G-E-212
—207— 
Gallatin on Monday morning, June 9, and continued in ses- 
sion ten days. The Institute was conducted by Capt. C. S. 
Douglass, Superintendent of the Gallatin city schools. He was 
assisted by Prof. P. A. Lyons, of the Nashville city schools; 
Mrs. C. L. Fraley, of the Nashville city schools; and Professor 
Moore, of Clay County. The total enrollment during the twe 
weeks was over 125. We had good work, and our teachers 
seemed to be more interested than ever before. The attendance 
was regular. Our teachers were well pleased with the instrue- 
tion. They were especially interested in Capt. C. S. Douglass’ 
lectures on ‘‘ Tennessee History.” 
The colored teachers had a two-weeks’ Institute. They all 
attended the Institute. : 
Many of our teachers have been teaching in. the same places 
for a number of years. 
The second Monday of the Institute was set apart as Direct- 
ors’ Day. We had present on that day more directors than ever 
before in the history of Sumner County. The chairman of our 
County Court, Judge William Hall, was present on Directors’ 
Day, and assured the teachers that he was in favor of doing 
anything in his power to aid the schools. He also assured them 
that he would assist in making the terms longer. Mayor James 
W. Blackmore was also present on Directors’ Day, and assured 
the teachers and directors that he thought it more honorable to 
be a school director than to hold any other office in the gift of 
his people, and that he was ready at any and all times to do any- 
thing in his power to help Sumner County make its school terms 
longer. - The general sentiment in Sumner County is for longer 
terms of school, and we hope to accomplish this in, the next 
year. 
One day during the Institute our County Court Clerk, Harris 
Brown, one of the trustees of the University of Tennessee, made 
an address to the Institute, and showed to the teachers the great 
benefit of a college education and the great work that the Uni- 
versity of Tennessee is undertaking. He promised us. his co- 
operation in the great work that we have undertaken. The In-
-P-A-G-E-213
5 
stitute has not only been of educational value, but it has imbued 
the teachers with a most earnest professional spirit. 
We are glad to report progress, and that the interest in school 
work is general with our people. 
W. F. ALBRIGHT, Superintendent. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
  
T have the honor to submit herewith my twelfth annual report. 
Our Institute was quite a success. The work done by the 
Conduetors was of an excellent character, and was highly ap- 
preciated by the teachers. 
In reviewing my work, I find the scholastic population has in- 
creased since 1891 from 9,000 to 11,700; the value of school 
property, from $5,000 to $27,755 ; the school tax, from 25 cents 
te 50 cents; the average number of days, from 75 to 102. In- 
convenient, uncomfortable, and unsightly schoolhouses have 
been removed, and attractive, convenient, and comfortable ones 
have been erected in their place. ‘The school districts have been 
made identical with the civil districts, and from one to two eight- 
months’ schools are conducted in each district, thereby making 
it possible for any child to receive an English education with- 
out leaving the district. Yet the public schools of Tipton County 
are just in their infancy. 
Let the people once divest themselves of prejudice and the 
thoughtless disposition to interfere with the schools, give the 
public school and the public-school teacher the same protection 
against disorderly conduct as is guaranteed to our churches and 
our ministry, and the educational possibility now dormant in 
our county is beyond the speculation of the most Joyal and ardent 
supporter. JAMES A. COTTEN, Superintendent.

TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
  
Our annual Institute opened on June 2 and closed on June 
15, with 95 per cent of our teachers in attendance. The Insti- 
tute was conducted by Miss Pattie Malone, of Sumner County, 
who was ably assisted by Professor Turney, of Watertown; Pro- 
fessor Wilson and Miss Peebles, of Hartsville; and others. The 
interest was all that could be asked for. Our teachers are wide 
awake, and are always ready to take advantage of any opportu- 
nity offered to better qualify themselves for their work. We 
desire to thank our State Superintendent for sending us Pro- 
fessor Turney and Miss Malone to assist us in our work. Su- 
perintendent Albright, of Sumner County, and Captain Doug- 
lass were with us on Thursday night and gave our people good 
advice. Our teachers cheerfully performed the work assigned 
them, and all took part in the work. 
We believe that we are progressing in the right direction in 
our county. We have more money now than ever before, and 
that means longer terms. 
LYTLE DALTON, Superintendent. 
UNICOI COUNTY. 
  
The Unicoi County Normal was opened on July 28 by the 
County Superintendent, with Miss Lula Broyles as Secretary, 
and continued five days. It was a meeting of general interest 
and good feeling, in which every one participated. The vis- 
itors and the teachers showed that the entire community was 
interested in school work. Prof. J. T. Pope and Mrs. Ella 
Pope, both of Boone’s Creek Seminary; Prof. A. F. Craven, of 
Columbian University, Washington, D. C.; Prof. S. W. Tindell, 
of the Temperance University, Harriman; Prof. A. K. Har- 
rold; Miss Lee V. Coleman; Prof. Fred. V. Cartright, of 
Fall Branch; Rev. Day, of Tusculum; and Prof. R. M. Barry,
-P-A-G-E-215
—210— 
were the principal Instructors. A number of good county teach- 
ers also rendered invaluable aid. Special mention is due Pro- 
fessor Craven for his lecture on “ Psychology; ” Professor 
Tindell, on “Agriculture; ” Professor Pope, on “ Tennessee 
History; ” and Miss Oscella Pendleton, on ‘ Horticulture.” 
The night exercises consisted of literary addresses and recita- 
tions and songs of an entertaining nature. 
The eause of education is gaining rapidly in Unicoi County. 
We have the children with the brains to cope with any county. 
Dame Nature has smiled on our county as she has smiled on few 
counties in the State, and our youths are going to take the front 
ranks. LIZZIE ROBERTS, Superintendent. 
UNION COUNTY. 
Our Institute was held at Maynardville from July 21 to July 
26, with the assistance of the following educators: G. Milton 
Elam, of Blaine Normal School, Kentucky; W. L. Stooksbury, 
of Carson and Newman College, Jefferson City; M. M. Dos- 
sett, of the University of Harriman, Harriman; C. T. Carpen- 
ter, of Andersonville Institute; and E. M. Ellison, of Powell’s 
Valley Seminary ; together with the teachers of the county. The 
Institute'was pronounced by the veterans of the cause of edu- 
cation, as well as by the teachers of the county, the most bene- 
ficial Institute ever held in this county. 
Our teachers are interested in educational journals, and 
nearly all of them are subscribers.

VAN BUREN COUNTY.   
The Van Buren County Institute began on Monday, ne 26, 
and continued one week. It was held in Burritt College, at

Spencer. Prof. S. H. Proffitt was made Conductor as well as 
{nstructor of the Institute. Mr. Glenn A. Worthington, of 
Pikeville, acted as Secretary. There was an average attend- 
ance of 30 or more, and the general opinion was that this was 
one of the most successful Institutes Van Buren County ever 
held. Van Buren County has about twenty public schools. 
L. S. GILLENTINE, Superintendent. 
WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
  
The annual Institute for white teachers was conducted by 
me at the public school building in Franklin during the week 
beginning on July 7. I was assisted by Prof. E. B. Wil- 
son, of Hartsville, and by the following Instructors of this 
county: Profs. J. C. Goodrich, T. E. Clay, J. C. Brooks, T. I. 
Pettus, E. R. Chest, and J. W. Neal. All of these did excellent 
work. Professor Wilson is a deep thinker, an interesting 
speaker, and a practical teacher. The attendance was large and 
regular, and the Institute was a decided success. Five days, 
from 8 till 1 o’clock, were given to lectures, and the examina- 
tions were held from 2 to 5 o’clock on Thursday and Friday 
and during the full day on Saturday.

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
  
It affords me pleasure to submit my fourth annual report of 
Institute work and the general condition of education in Weak- 
ley County. 
The State Peabody Institute at Martin was in every way a 
great success. There were in attendance over 300 teachers, rep- 
resenting nineteen counties. No other State Institute had a bet-
-P-A-G-E-218
lo 
ter, worthier, or more capable and efficient faculty. The teach- 
ers and members of the faculty worked together in perfect har- 
mony and good will from beginning to end. Profs. G. R. Me- 
Gee, Conductor, and Fred. J. Page, E. B. Wilson, and H. L. 
Higgs, Instructors, all have the highest personal and profes- 
sional regard of the teachers who attended this Institute. The 
geod people of Martin did well their part in the way of en- 
tertaining and caring for the teachers and visitors. There were 
a number of lectures delivered, the most important of which 
were those of Hon. G. E. Bowden, Col. G. W. Martin, and 
Prof. T. B. Loggins. The good people of Martin and Weakley 
County extend to Hon. Morgan ©. Fitzpatrick their profoyad 
and heartfelt thanks for locating the State Peabody Institute 
at Martin for the second time during his unparalleled adminis- 
tration of the public-school affairs of the State. 
The schools of Weakley County were never more prosperous 
and popular than they are now. ‘This is due to the good teach- 
ers and school directors. 
8. S. FEATHERSTON, Superintendent. 
WAYNE COUNTY. 
  
The Wayne County Teachers’ Institute was held at Waynes- 
boro, beginning on June 16 and ending on June 24. The serv- 
ices of Profs. W. Z. Stricklin and Joe Sims, of the Harriman 
University, were secured for the Institute ; and they were assisted 
by T. F. McAnally and Professor Woodside, of the Savannah 
High School. Professors Stricklin and Sims hail from Wayne 
County, are well known by all the teachers of the county, and 
need no further commendation from me. The attendance at the 
Institute was good, and the work done by the Instructors was 
all that could be desired. The teachers seemed to be in earnest 
and very enthusiastic, and since the schools have commenced I 
have visited most of them and found them in good working order.
-P-A-G-E-219
ees 
The teachers are doing more for the schools this year than last 
year. The success of the school to a great extent depends on the 
teacher ; and if we had longer schools and more money, we would 
have a number of good schools in Wayne County. 
T. F. WANALLY, Superintendent. 
WILSON COUNTY. 
  
The Wilson County Summer Institute for white teachers con- 
vened at the Lebanon College for Young Ladies, at Lebanon, on 
June 23, and continued two weeks. We enrolled more than 100 
teachers and had good attendance throughout the meeting. We 
were ably assisted in our work by Misses Mary Lou Goodwin 
and Ethel Northern, of the Tarbox School, of Nashville, and 
by Dr. E. O. Kaserman, of the Brandon Training School, of 
Tullahoma. The State Superintendent was with us on July + 
and delivered a fine address. 
The colored teachers of Wilson County held a good Institute 
in the colored public school building at Lebanon, beginning on 
June 16 and continuing two weeks. Our colored teachers em- 
ploy their own home teachers to conduct their meetings, and 
they are doing good work. They enrolled about 40 teachers and 
had good and regular attendance. They keep up a regular 
monthly Institute throughout the entire year.

REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE, 
Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my annual report 
for the year ending on December 20, 1902. 
The last scholastic year was one of rapid growth in all the 
affairs of the University. All of the departments experienced 
a healthy development, the number of students continued to 
increase, and the influence of the University was extended far- 
ther in every direction. 
The two notable events of the year were the inauguration of 
the Summer School of the South upon the grounds of the Uni- 
versity and the establishment of the Department of Education. 
Both of these will be discussed farther on. 
The attendance upon the University during the year 1901- 
1902 was as follows:

among the different courses as follows: Agriculture, 44; Horti- 
culture, 43; Mechanical Arts, 107; English, 238 ; Mathematics, 
216; Latin, 108, ete. (See University of Tennessee Record, 
page 101, Vol. V., No. 1.) There were 199 students in the 
department of Military Science and 10 in the new department 
of Pharmacy. 
All the scholarships from Tennessee were taken up, and the 
Board extended free tuition to a considerable number of other 
Tennessee students who could not get scholarships. ‘These schol- 
arships ought to be made the reward of good work done in the 
public schools and other preparatory schools. The law requires 
that all candidates shall be examined each year by County Su- 
perintendents or City Superintendents, in accordance with the 
plan promulgated by the State Superintendent. It is very de- 
sirable that this system be better enforced in the future, with 
the result that better students will be sent to the University. : 
The requirements for admission to the Freshman Classes of 
the Agricultural and Literary Courses are fixed as nearly as 
possible so as to take the students upon the completion of the 
State Secondary School Course. Unfortunately, this course is 
‘very imperfectly carried out in the so-called “secondary 
schools,” and very few persons graduate from them. Onur re- 
quirements also accord with those of the Association of Colleges 
and Preparatory Schools of the Southern States. 
The requirements for admission f the Engineering Courses 
have been recently advanced about one year. It is now neces- 
sary that the students shall have completed both Algebra and 
Geometry to enter the Freshman Class in the. Engineering 
Courses. A great deal of professional instruction has to be 
given in these courses, which is dependent upon the practical 
Mathematics. This could not be imparted successfully with- 
out requiring more Mathematics for entrance. We are glad to 
be able to report that this advance has not reduced, but has 
rather increased, the attendance upon the Engineering Depart- 
ments. It is hoped that we may soon be able to advance in like
-P-A-G-E-224
219 
manner the requirements in other subjects, but this cannot be 
done until the public secondary schools do their work more thor- 
cughly. The requirements for the Literary Course have been 
steadily advanced during the last ten years, and they now stand 
as high as we can safely put them at present. We dare not ad- 
vance our requirements higher for fear of excluding the young 
people from the country districts. The position of a State uni- 
versity is different from that of a private institution. An in- 
stitution like this must make itself a part of the public educa- 
tional system and be in position to train the best pupils from the 
existing public schools; but it must at the same time do all it 
can to improve all the public schools. 
For these reasons the University is taking an earnest part 
in the present movement for the development of public education 
in the South. It stands ready to codperate with every agency 
at work in this cause. It is a matter of gratification to the man- 
agement of the University that it has been able to assist in this 
work in two directions. The University has invited the teach- 
ers of the South to meet upon its grounds for the purpose of 
holding a great annual summer school, and it has established a 
Department of Education for their more systematic professional 
training. 
The first session of the Summer School of the South was held 
at the University of Tennessee from June 19 to July 31. The 
Board of Trustees of the University gave the use of their build- 
ings and grounds, with water, gas, electricity, lights, and the 
services of such janitors as they had employed for this time. 
The eighty or more courses offered were grouped under the fol- 
lowing heads: 
1. Common school subjects and methods, including Kinder- 
garten, Primary School Organization, Primary and Elementary 
Reading, Expression, Arithmetic, Elementary Geometry, Geog- 
raphy, Grammar and Rhetoric, United States History, and Civil 
Government. Great emphasis was put upon Nature Study, and 
courses were given in Botany, Zodlogy, Ornithology, Elementary 
Agriculture and Horticulture. A school garden was estab-
-P-A-G-E-225
20 
lished illustrating the courses of instruction. The Agricultural 
Experiment Station Farm was a valuable adjunct. Great em- 
phasis was also put upon instruction in the various forms of 
Manual Training, including Drawing, Basketry, Weaving, and 
Sewing. School Music, Physical Culture, and School Games 
were also taught. In most of these subjects several different 
courses were offered by different instructors. n all both sub- 
ject-matter and methods were taught. In all the classes of this 
department the attendance was very large. In most cuses it was 
limited only by the capacity of the rooms in which the classes 
were held. The rooms were usually crowded to the utmost ex- 
tent, the people sitting in the windows and standing about the 
doors. The attendance upon this department exceeded 600; 
over 400 took one or more of the Manual Training courses; 
some 250 took Botany and Elementary Agriculture and Horti- 
culture; at least 500 attended the classes in Nature Study. 
2. High school and college subjects, including English Lan- 
guage and Literature; the Latin, Greek, German, and French 
Languages and their literatures; Medixval History; History 
of the Reformation; English History; Modern European His- 
tory; Mathematics, including Algebra, Plane Geometry, Trigo- 
nometry, Analytic Geometry, and Calculus (the attendance 
upon the classes in Mathematics was so very large that we had 
to employ two extra professors after the school opened) ; Chem- 
istry, including General Chemistry and Qualitative and Quan- 
titative Analysis (some 40 students in these subjects) ; Phys- 
ies (100 students) ; Botany (40 students in the higher courses) ; 
Geology and Mineralogy (80 students) ; Physiography of North 
America and Distribution and Adaptation of Plants and Ani- 
mals. Two courses were given by Dr. C. Hart Merriam, and 
were attended by from 1,000 to 1,200 persons. Other gentle- 
men gave courses of popular science lectures, which were also 
very largely attended indeed. Probably 1,500 persons attended 
regularly. 
8. Department of Psychology and Pedagogy. This is the 
professional school of the teacher. In it was given instruction
-P-A-G-E-226
O91 
in Psychology (Miss Parrish), History of Education (Dr. Al- 
derman, Professor Claxton, and others), the Philosophy and 
Principles of Education (Dr. Rose, Dr. Tompkins, Dr. Greg- 
ory, and others), School Management and the Art of Teaching 
(Dr. Gregory, Dr. E. E. White, and others). All of these 
classes were very largely attended. Miss Parrish would have 
a room crowded to the walls and windows—in her largest «lass, 
200 or 300; in a more advanced one, from 100 to 150. The 
lectures of Drs. White, Alderman, Hall, Tompkins, Gregory, 
and others were so largely attended that we had to hold them 
under a pavilion out of doors. The average attendance on these 
lectures, held where the people could get within hearing distance, 
was probably 1,600. In all these departments the work fol- 
lowed the outlines published in the announcement. 
Perhaps the most interesting and important general feature 
of the school was the Educational Campaigners’ Convention on 
July 4, 5. The enthusiasm reached its height on the after- 
noon of July 4, when the students held a great patriotie demon- 
stration in behalf of better education in the Southern States, 
and Dr. Henry St. George Tucker, of Virginia, and Superin- 
tendent Lawton B. Evans, of Georgia, made addresses. A com- 
mittee of the representatives of the student body had been ap- 
pointed some days before to draw up a declaration of principles 
with regard to the cdueational needs of the South, which was 
read by President Dabney and adopted amid great enthusiasm. 
This declaration was signed by Charles W. Dabney, Chair- 
man; Charles D. McIver, Secretary; Edgar Gardner Murphy, 
Alabama; A. Hf. Abbott, Arkansas; Arthur Williams, Florida; 
Joseph D. Smith, Georgia; J. T. Gaines, Kentucky; Edwin A. 
Alderman, Louisiana; D. H. Hill, Mississippi; Collier Cobb, 
North Carolina; Ernest Wiggins, South Carolina; Wickliffe 
Rose, Tennessee; A. L. Malone, Texas; B. R. Smith, Virginia; 
and is as follows: 
“ DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES. 
“We, the 1,700 teachers attending the Summer School of the 
South, representing every Southern State, do, on this, the day
-P-A-G-E-227
of our national independence, unanimously adopt the following 
declaration of educational policy: 
“1. We bear grateful testimony to the great sacrifices made 
in behalf of education by the people of the South, who in their 
desolation and poverty have taxed themselves hundreds of mil- 
lions of dollars to educate two races. 
“9. Notwithstanding these efforts, we are confronted with 
the appalling fact that the large majority of the 3,500,000 white 
children and 2,500,000 black children of the South are not pro- 
vided with good schools. In 1900 ten Southern States, having 
25 per cent of the school population of this country, owned only 
4 per cent of the public school property and expended only 61% 
per cent of the public school moneys. We must recognize these 
conditions and frankly face them. We, therefore, declare our. 
selves in favor of a public school system, State supported and 
State directed, in which every child may have the open door of 
opportunity. 
“3. Conscious of our dependence upon the God of cur fathers 
and believing that the highest and truest civilization can be 
attained qnly by following the precepts of the great Teacher, 
Jesus Christ, we favor the recognition of the Bible in our publie 
schools. 
“4, We regard local taxation as the foundation upon which 
a publie school system should be built, and, therefore, favor an 
agitation in behalf of such taxation in every community. 
“5. If an increased expenditure of money is to be of lasting 
value, a more intelligent public interest must be brought to bear 
upon our schools; but even greater than the need of money and 
interest is the need, of intelligent direction. 
“6. A mere extension of the present school term, with the 
present course of study, will not meet the needs of the children. 
The lines of development in the South must be both agricultural 
and mechanical. . Our people must bring a trained brain and a 
trained hand to the daily labor. Education should he a means 
not of escaping labor, but of making it more effective. The 
school should be the social center of the community, and should
-P-A-G-E-228
—223— 
actively and sympathetically touch all the social and economic 
interests of the people. In addition to the usual academic stud- 
ies, therefore, our courses should include Manual Training, Na- 
ture Study, and Agriculture. 
“7, To secure more efficient supervision, to encourage grad- 
ing, and to broaden the social life of the children, we favor the 
consolidation of weak schools into strong central schools. It 
is better in every way to carry the child to the school than to 
carry the school to the child. We indorse the movement re- 
cently made by the women of the South for model schools, built 
with due regard to sanitation, ventilation, and beauty. 
“8. Teaching should be a profession, and‘not a stepping-stone 
to something else. We, therefore, stand for the highest train- 
ing of teachers and urge the school authorities of every State ‘ 
to encourage those who wish to make the educating of children 
a life profession. We call upon the people to banish forever 
politics and nepotism from the public schools and to establish a 
system in which, from the humblest teacher to the office of State 
Superintendent, merit shall be the touchstone. 
“9. We express our hearty appreciation of the noble work 
of the Southern and General Education Boards, which, by their 
earnest sympathy and generous means, have made possible this 
great Summer School of the South and in numerous other ways 
are strengthening the patriotic efforts of the Southern people to 
improve their educational conditions. 
“10. With gratitude to our fathers for the heritage of a no- 
ble past, with thankfulness to God for the many blessings be- 
stowed upon our people, with due recognition of our present 
- problems and their deep importance, we face the future with a 
faith which we shall endeavor to make good by our works to the 
lasting glory of our republic.” 
The morning and afternoon of July 5 were devoted to the 
discussion of the needs of our country and village schools. 
Many educators were present from all parts of the South and 
joined in the discussion. So much interest was deveioped that 
an open meeting had to be held on. the evening of the 5th, when
-P-A-G-E-229
spot 
many volunteers were given an opportunity to speak. This was 
the subject of general conversation throughout the whole school, 
and elicited so much interest that it had to be given another 
meeting on the last night of the session, when a number of the 
students took part in the discussion. 
Daily mectings of school officers and Institute Conductors 
were held during the first two weeks of the school and were well 
attended and proved most profitable. Several meetings of each 
of the State organizations were held, in which they discussed 
their local interests and the general interests of education in 
the South. 
Tn all, seven meetings of Sunday school workers were held 
on Sunday evenings, with an average attendance of about 400. 
They were addressed by leading Sunday school workers, who 
were followed usually by round-table discussions. 
In addition to the regular classes in the courses outlined 
above, some thirty popular lectures were given by leading edu- 
eators of the South and a number from the North and by mem- 
bers of the faculty of the school. These lectures covered a great 
variety of subjects—literary, historic, and scientifie—but the 
majority of them discussed phases of the Southern educational 
problem. Some of the subjects were as follows: Dr. Emerson 
White gave the convocation address at the opening of the school 
on “ Universal Education the Duty of the Hour; ” Professor 
Fortier, of Tulane University, gave two interesting lectures on 
“ The History of Louisiana ” and “ The Louisiana Purchase; ” 
Professor Smith lectured on “ Southern Orators; ” Dr. McIver, 
on “The Education of Women;” and Professor Gibson, on “The - 
Industrial School at Columbus, Ga.” There were other lec- 
tures too numerous to mention. ‘These lectures were very 
largely attended indeed, the average attendance being from 
1,600 to 1,800. The following shows the attendance by States:

SO 
The Tennessee registration included 434 men and 569 women, 
making a total of 1,003, of whom 431 were actual teachers. 
As will be seen, the total registration was 2,019. This does 
not give the total attendance upon the school. The halls were 
wide open during the first four and the last four days of the 
session. It became necessary to protect the persons who had 
come from a distance by keeping a gate and stationing ushers 
at the door. Still, a great many persons attending the school 
never registered. 
The most notable thing about the body of teachers was not 
their numbers, however, but their quality. They represented 
the very best teachers in the Southern States. A census showed 
that a large majority of them were graduates of colleges or nor- 
mal schools of college rank. 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall said of the Summer School of the South: 
“Tt is the largest one in the world. In numbers and interest 
it has never been surpassed. From what observation I have 
been able to give the class work, the character of the work being 
done is of the best. TI think that the greatest impression made 
upon me, next to the number, is the social quality of the stu- 
dents. This means more than you can possibly appreciate. 
This school is sure to have a tremendous influence upon South- 
ern civilization.” : 
Rey. Edgar Gardner Murphy said of this school in the New 
York Evening Post: 
“The Summer School of the South, which has recently econ 
cluded its six-weeks’ term at Knoxville, Tenn., was in many re- 
spects an institution unique in the history of our country. It 
was a school for teachers. These came from every quarter of 
the South. It was a gathering not for play, but for work. The ‘ 
impressiveness of the school is not adequately represented by 
its numbers. The character of the institution was marked by 
the value of the work performed ; by the intelligent earnestness, 
the unsparing industry, and the broad sympathies of the stu- 
dent body. Yet the numerical significance of such a gathering 
is not to be overlooked. In a part of our country where the
-P-A-G-E-232
population is so largely rural (there are about as many cities 
of 25,000 inhabitants and over in the one small State of Massa- 
chusetts as in all the Southern States combined), and where 
many sections are so thinly settled by the white population that 
great common enterprises can seldom be attempted, the moral 
and educational value of numbers is of evident importance. 
The reader cannot well understand the tasks and problems of 
the South till he stops to realize that the combined white pop- 
ulation of two such States as South Carolina and Alabama does 
not equal the white population of the city of Chicago. The 
white population of the city of Greater New York exceeds the 
ageregate white population of the States of Alabama, Florida, 
Louisiana, South Carolina, and Mississippi. A gathering of 
more than 2,000 men and women, fairly representative of the 
potential and actual teaching force of such a section, was, there- 
fore, both an achievement and an inspiration. It was also of 
far-reaching social significance. 
“The quality of the personnel of the student body was the 
subject of much comment on the part of visitors from other 
sections. The relative poverty of the South has its compensa- 
tions. It places at the command of the public school system 
of the Southern States, at remuneration which would seem ab- 
surdly small elsewhere, a teaching force of real culture and the 
truest refinement. This high social average of the Southern 
teachers means that the training of the children of the South 
is in the hands of worthy representatives of its thought and feel- 
ing. It means that in its public school system the South to- 
day is touching through its best medium the life of the future: 
“There was nothing exclusively sectional in the attendance. 
There was a small representation of students from the North 
and the Middle West. The faculty, which numbered about 
seventy-five, was selected with rare catholicity of appreciation. 
New England men, like Dr. William T. Harris, United States 
Commissioner of Education, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the 
United States Geological Survey, together with distinguished 
representatives from New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Indiana,
-P-A-G-E-233
—228— 
and Ohio, met upon the same platform with the many well- 
known educators of the South. There was everywhere among 
» the students a feeling of intense devotion to Southern interests, 
but this feeling was fused with a national patriotism which was 
often given spontaneous and moving expression. 
“ Nothing was more strikingly evident among these hundreds 
of teachers than the high average of individual earnestness. 
Here were throngs of men and women (the latter were, of 
course, in the majority) giving their precious vacation weeks 
to better preparation for the service of their profession. Many 
of them had never known salaries larger than $30 or $35 per 
month; many of them were expending practically the whole of 
their slender savings in meeting the expense for railway travel, 
for board, for the few necessary books (there was no charge for 
tuition, save the registration fee of $5); and yet every sacrifice 
was made, and the serious work of the school was continued un- 
til the end—all in an atmosphere of pervasive cheerfulness and 
amid every evidence of buoyant and hopeful courage. 
“There was upon the part of some an almost too eaver desire 
to get the full measure of return from every hour. Upon the 
part of all there was, for the serious instruction, the response 
of genuine intellectual enthusiasm—not only the hunger for 
light, but the joy of a codperative sympathy—a desire for the 
best and a desire to put it at once to work. There was not 
merely a zeal for admiring things, but a zeal for using them. 
The dominant note, the constant and heroic note, was, therefore, 
practical. All in all, I have never witnessed anything finer in 
American life. 
“Tt is intended to continue at Knoxville what, upon a still 
larger and more comprehensive scale, may be termed in a pecul- 
iar sense ‘the Summer School of the South ’—a school not ex- 
clusively for Knoxville or for Tennessee, but for all the South. 
The promoters of the school hope to provide a great. representa- 
tive institution, well organized and well equipped, presenting 
an ample range of subjects through the very ablest teaching 
force that careful selection and adequate resources can command.
-P-A-G-E-234
S909 
It is expected that the number to be admitted will be fixed next 
year at an enrollment of 3,000.” 
Impressed by the great interest in this whole subject of popu 
lar education, and especially by the great demand on the part 
of teachers for professional training, the Board of Trustees, at 
their meeting on July 22, resolved to establish a Department 
of Education in the University, and instructed the President to 
solicit funds for its support. It was proposed to establish— 
not another normal school, but rather a professional school of 
the teacher, a place where persons already having the elements 
of the liberal education ean pursue those studies which will qual- 
ify them successfully to discharge the duties of the high-school 
and college teacher. It is intended to organize a department 
for teachers corresponding to the professional schools for law- 
yers and physicians. 
At the meeting of the Board of Trustees on September 30 
the President reported that he had secured funds snfficient to 
guarantee the maintenance of the department for at least three 
years. The Board, therefore, instructed the President to sub- 
mit immediately plans for the organization of a Department of 
Education and make all of the arrangements for inaugurating 
its work at the opening of the second term on Tuesday, January 
6. Prof. Philander P. Claxton, a graduate of the University 
of Tennessee in the Class of 1882, recently Professor of Peda- 
gogy in the North Carolina Normal and Industrial College and 
Superintendent of the Summer School of the South, was elected 
Professor of Pedagogy in the new department. Instruction 
will be provided in this department in the following other sub- 
jects: Psychology and Ethics, History of Education and School 
Legislation and Economics, Physical Geography and Nature 
Study, Methods of Teaching English, and the Theory and Prae- 
tice of Manual Training. Other professors and instructors will 
be elected at an early day, and the work of the new department 
will be announced. Great interest is manifested in it, and 2 
good attendance is expected from the beginning. 
The Trustees and Faculty of the University have much to
-P-A-G-E-235
—230— 
be grateful for in the past year and look forward to the new 
year with hope for greater usefulness and prosperity for the 
institution. The great need of the University is more and bet- 
ter buildings to accommodate its multiplying departments and 
growing classes. The Trustees and alumni have plans on foot 
which it is hoped will lead to the erection of a new academic 
building for the accommodation of the ordinary classes, a large 
auditorium, and a dining hall. 
Respectfully submitted, 
CHARLES W. DABNEY, President. 
PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
  
Sir: I have to report for the College a satisfactory and profit- 
able year. 
The general demeanor and moral tone of the students has 
been exemplary. In a quite limited number of cases has warn- 
ing or rebuke been found necessary. The student body, as a 
whole, has been characterized by earnestness and an evident de- 
sire to make the best use of the opportunities offered at the 
College. I am informed that the work done has been fully up 
to the average and that the first-year students of the past session 
showed a marked improvement in fitness for college over those 
of previous years. 
The attendance this year has been 577, of whom 237 were 
young men and 340-were young women, the average age being 
21.2 years. The representation of States is as follows: Ala- 
bama, 29; Arkansas, 28; Florida, 16; Georgia, 34; Kentucky, 
1; Louisiana, 30; Mississippi, 27; Michigan, 1; Minnesota, 
1; Indian Territory, 1; North Carolina, 29; South Carolina, 
25; Tennessee, 274; Texas, 41; Virginia, 27; West Virginia, 
18. Students took the various courses of study as follows: 
Pedagogy, 441; Latin, 423; Mathematics, 444; Surveying, 21;
-P-A-G-E-236
—231— 
History, 482; English, 349; Literature, 260; Biology, 228; 
Physics, 236; Chemistry, 207; Philosophy, 203; Art, 226; 
Music, 242; Geology, 18; Physical Geography, 32; Astronomy, 
24; French, 96; German, 41; Greek, 113; Economics, 35; 
School Law, 40. Degrees were conferred as follows: Licen- 
tiate of Instruction, 118, of whom 48 were Tennesseans—32 
women and 16 men. The University conferred the degree of 
Bachelor of Arts upon 25, of whom 6 were Tennesseans; ithe 
degree of Bachelor of Science, upon 6, of whom 1 was from 
Tennessee ; the degree of Master of Arts, upon 2, of whom 1 was 
from Tennessee; the degree of Master of Science, upon 1. The 
Trustees of the University conferred an honorary degree— 
that of Master of Arts—upon Cleburne Lee Hayes, of Florida, 
a graduate from Tennessee of the College, and John Hartwell 
Hinemon, of Arkansas. 
You will observe that the attendance this year (577) is 30 
less than last year, for which there are several causes: 
1. Heretofore students have been admitted to the College — 
who were deficient in three branches. Beginning with October 
last, they were admitted if deficient in two only; and if deficient 
in three, they were required to take those courses in the Model 
School until their “ conditions ” were removed. 
2. The life class in Art last year required practically the 
whole time of one instructor. The class contained 44, many of 
whom were residents of Nashville, did not intend to be teach- 
ers, and did not pay tuition. As gratuitous instruction in ad- 
vanced Art, particularly when looked upon as an accomplish- 
ment, was not regarded as within the objects of the College, one 
instructor was placed in charge of the whole work and tuition 
was charged those unwilling to give the pledge to teach. The 
class this year has numberee 15. 
3. About 25 students were notified last summer that their 
work for the preceding year had been unsatisfactory, and that 
they should not return, unless determined to give better atten- 
tion to their duties. About one-half of them returned this 
year ; the others did not.
-P-A-G-E-237
—232— 
' The Board will recall the fact that this year a fee of $1 per 
year was added to the incidental fee of $10, called the “ hos- 
pital fee,” and was intended to cover the medical, surgical, and 
hespital charges of students too ill to be left in their boarding 
places. The amount has been found inadequate, the College 
has sustained some loss, and the fee has been increased for next 
year to $2, payable one-half each semester. The students have 
been well satisfied with this year’s experiment. A number seri- 
ously ill have received in hospital care that they could not hope 
for in their boarding houses, and no deaths have occurred this 
year, against four for the previous year. 
The University of Nashville has maintained the Chair of 
Modern Languages in the College and paid insurance on: the 
buildings. It has, during the year, executed to the Peabody 
Board of Trust a deed of conveyance of the grounds and build- 
ings now used by the College, with power of sale for reinvest- 
ment in Davidson County. The Peabody Board has maintained 
33 scholarships for Tennessee—1 for each senatorial district— 
worth each $100 per year in money and railroad fare. 
To keep pace with other institutions of learning, and espe- 
cially to offer instruction to teachers who cannot attend the 
winter sessions of the colleges, it was deemed advisable to hold 
a six-weeks’ summer session of the College. The course of study 
ineluded Philosophy and Pedagogy, Mathematics, Science, 
English, Latin, American History, History. The Instructors 
were: Profs. W. R. Garrett, Lizzie L. Bloomstein, H. A. Vance, 
C. E. Little, J. M. King, S. G. Gilbreath, E. W. Kennedy, and 
Mary P. Jones, of the College; J. W. Brister, of the Montgom- 
ery Bell Academy;_A. T. Barrett, of Chattanooga; and Ida H. 
Clark, of the Nashville city schools. The session opened on 
June 16 and closed on July 26, registering 448 students, a ma- 
jority of whom were teachers. An announcement of the session 
is hereto attached, showing the course of study, ete. No charge 
whatever was made this year, and it is hoped that the success 
of this school will justify its being made permanent. 
On account of the common and indiscriminate use of the term
-P-A-G-E-238
pa eee 
“normal” by small schools throughout the country, the Execu- 
tive Committee of the Peabody Board have strongly urged that 
the word be dropped and the College be known in future as the 
“ Peabody College for Teachers.” Presuming that the change 
would meet the approval of the State Board, the catalogue for 
the current year appears with that title. 
The publication of the American Historical Magazine by the 
College has been discontinued, in accordance with the sugges- 
tion made at your last meeting. The magazine is being con- 
ducted by Messrs. A. V. and W. H. Goodpasture, under the 
supervision of the Tennessee Historical Society, and the sums 
heretofore expended on it are being used for printed matter 
intended to advertise*the College. 
T attach hereto a copy of the report of Mr. C. Flisher, certified 
accountant, showing the result of his examination of the books 
and accounts of the Secretary of the College. 
Very respectfully,

UNIVERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
Sir: I have the honor, as Chancellor of the University of 
Nashville, to submit to you the following report for the year 
ending with May. 
The history of this well-known institution, extending from 
1785 to the present time, has been given at length in the reports 
of my predecessor, to which reference is made. It is sufficient 
to say that the University has maintained its usefulness and 
honorable record in all departments the past year. Its depart- 
ments are as follows: 
The Peabody College for Teachers, with the Winthrop Model 
School. : 
The Medical College. 
The Montgomery Bell Academy.

THE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS. 
The report of this department in detail has been previously 
submitted to you in a separate communication, to which, for 
fuller information, reference is here made. It is the only de- 
partment of the University which receives appropriations from 
the State, which contributes to its maintenance the sum of $20,- 
000 per year. 
The Peabody Board of Trust gives an annual appropriation 
for salaries and supports 192 scholarships, apportioned among 
12 Southern States. 
The Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville con- 
tribute the use of the grounds and buildings and materially aid 
in paying the current expenses of the College. 
The course of study includes the following general subjects, 
under the supervision of 28 instructors and officers: Science 
and Art of Teaching, Philosophy, Greek, Latin, English Lan- 
guage, English Literature, French, German, American, History, 
History, Economics, Mathematics, Astronomy, Chemistry, Ge- 
ology, Physies, Biology, Physical Geography, School Law, Vo- 
cal Music, Art, Physical Training. 
The College confers the professional degree of Licentiate of 
Instruction, the University confers the Bachelor’s and Master’s 
degrees. 
The College has for its Preparatory Department the Win- 
throp Model School, located on the College grounds, which is 
also used for purposes of \observation, under the direct control 
of the authorities, of the College. It is under the direction of 
Miss A. G. Glover, as Principal ; is organized in 10 grades, with 
6 instructors; and confers certificates of proficiency. 
THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. 
The Medical College was organized in 1850 by a number 
of eminent physicians of Nashville, and shas been successful al- 
most from the beginning. The teaching facilities have been 
increased from time to time to keep pace with the advances in
-P-A-G-E-240
9B hae 
medical learning. One by one the laboratories of Chemistry, 
Anatomy, Histology, Pathology, Bacteriology, Surgery, and 
Physiology have been added, until now the student is thor- 
onghly trained in practical and experimental work. At the 
saine time, the clinical facilities have been gradually increased 
in efficiency, the students now receiving three hours daily of clin- 
ical training in the Nashville City Hospital and the University 
Dispensary. f 
During the half century of its existence the Medical Depart- 
ment has graduated 4,408 physicians, probably the largest num- 
. ber of graduates of any Southern school of medicine. The 
mumber of courses offered has gradually increased, until now 
four years are required to complete the work leading to the 
degree. 
  The curriculum consists of 23 lecture courses, each accom- 
panied by a review quiz, and illustrated by 7 laboratory courses 
and three hours of clinical work daily. The faculty consists of 
13 professors and 12. assistants. At the last commencement 
84 students were graduated with the degree of Doctor of Med- 
icine. ( 
The officers of the Medical College are: Dr. W. G. Ewing, 
Dean; Dr. J. Dillard Jacobs, Secretary. 
THE MONTGOMERY BELL ACADEMY. 
This Academy is an endowed school, being one of the few in 
the Sonth maintained by an endowment. It was founded in 
1867 by the Trustees of the University upon a bequest of Mr. 
Montgomery Bell, the grounds and buildings being furnished 
by the University and the entire bequest of the donor being used 
as an endowment fund. 
The Academy is organized in two departments—a Grammar 
School. which has a three-years’ course of study, and a High 
School, with a four-years’ course, which is especially designed 
to prepare students for college or for business. It is well 
equipped in all its departments for instruction in clementary 
science, and is well supplied with apparatus, having a chemical
-P-A-G-E-241
—236— 
laboratory, a carefully-sclected library, and a valuable collec- 
tion of minerals. Nearly 2,000 students have attended the 
Academy since its foundation, in 1867. Prof. S. M. D. Clark 
has been its Principal for many years, with a total of five in- 
structors. 
The attendance in all the departments of the University for 
the past year was:

It may be proper, although not strictly to be included within 
the statistics of this year, to call attention to the establishment 
of a summer school of the Peabody College, which held a suc- 
cessful session of six weeks during the vacation, beginning on 
June 16. This school, though entirely unaided by scholar- 
ships, had an attendance of 448 registered students, which num- 
ber is not included in the total number for the year as given 
above. Respectfully submitted, 
JAMES D. PORTER, Chancellor. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you the annual report of 
the Tennessee School for the Blind for the year ending on 
June 5. 
This year has been remarkable for the great interest. taken 
by the entire country in education. From the leading univer- 
sities down to the humblest district school come the same hope- 
ful, cheery tidings that more students have entered than ever
-P-A-G-E-242
before; that teachers are better equipped and better paid than 
ever before; that libraries have been, better patronized, more 
books have been sold, and more magazines, periodicals, and 
newspapers have been bought and read than. ever before in the 
history of the nation. 
In glancing over the history of this School for the past year, 
we find a marked improvement in all its departments ; and al- 
though the attendance has not come up to our expectations, yet 
the number has never fallen below 205. The number of pupils 
enrolled during the session was: White—girls, 115; boys, 92; 
total, 207. Colored—girls, 21; boys, 22; total, 43. Sum total, 
250. Sixteen pupils were enabled to return home with normal 
vision hy means of treatment and glasses furnished them. 
The new building which was made possible by the liberality 
of the last General, Assembly, and the corner stone of which was 
laid on June 4, 1901, was completed and dedicated on November 
11, with simple and appropriate ceremony. Dr. Anderson deliv- 
ered the address, and was followed by several gentlemen in 
speeches on the growth and success of the School. It is a hand- 
some, three-story building, with an ample basement, which, 
when completed and equipped, will be a gymnasium for the 
girls. There are, besides, a large study hall, a capacious li- 
brary, 14 music rooms, 19 bedrooms—all heated by steam and 
lighted by electricity and gas. In its cheerful and sunny rooms 
50 of our older girls find a pleasant retreat from the routine of 
the schoolroom. A similar addition on the boys’ side, which 
I trust we will have in the near future, would give us sufficient 
room for years to come and would make our capacity 250 pupils. 
The School has been thoroughly graded, modeled upon sys- 
tems now in use in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia schools 
for the blind, slightly changed so as to harmonize with our pub- 
lie school system. The curriculum contains the usual branches 
of grammar and high school courses. I have recently engaged a 
teacher who is a specialist in primary work, and have given her 
charge of the lower grades. 
As musie is by far the most lucrative employment for the
-P-A-G-E-243
—-£38-— 
blind and as in it they can successfully compete with the seeing, 
every child who enters school is given a thorough trial, and, if 
possessed of talent, is given ample opportunity to acquire a 
knowledge of the art; but if deficient in ear or musical temper- 
ament, the child is relieved of the study of music and given 
other work. 
The Mechanical Department is of the greatest consequence 
to most of our children. Though all are given a good literary 
edneation and many excel in music, yet the majority must rely 
upon the labor of their hands for their daily bread. They are, 
therefore, taught the use of tools—to make articles which have 
a commercial value—this department being not only a manual 
training school, but a shop where hand and mind are taught 
to fashion and create objects of value and beauty. Every pupil 
is required to spend some time every day.in the workroom. 
Girls learn to use the sewing machine, to sew by hand, to knit, 
to crochet, and to make hammocks; while the boys are instructed 
in piano tuning, broom and mattress making, chair caning, ete. 
These three departments are so interwoven that the students find 
one a relaxation from the other, so that the time of all is fully 
oceupied without monotony or weariness. They are thus fitted 
for the struggle of life and so well equipped mentally that <here 
is little danger of failure. 
The question is often asked: What becomes of the children 
who are educated in this School, and what provision, if any, is 
made for their after care? The education given to our children 
is broad and thorough, equal to that given in the best schools 
of the State. With the complete and practical musical train- 
ing—embracing piano, pipe organ, and voice—and with a knowl- 
edge of the industries taught in our shops, our students, on grad- 
uation, return to their homes and soon find employinent in the 
trades or professions learned here. A number engage in the 
ordinary pursuits for which their education has fitted them and 
which heretofore were considered beyond their reach. No pro- 
vision has been made for their after care, as it has not been 
found at all necessary, except in a very few cases; then private
-P-A-G-E-244
—239— 
help sufficed. Every year or two I receive letters from ex- 
pupils giving an account of their trials and successes. In this 
way I keep acquainted with their history and am able to form 
a correct opinion of the results of the training given by the 
School. 
Environment and social conditions may dictate the extent as 
well as kind of training and edueation best adapted to the blind 
in certain communities or countries. So, in order to secure the 
best results possible, care must be taken to conform to existing 
conditions and to long-established customs. In the following I 
have endeavored to present in a clear and concise form some of 
the views and theories of eminent instructors of the blind both 
in Europe and America: 
In a cursory exatnination of the history of our own times we 
find that nearly all the nations of Christendom have greatly in- 
creased in wealth and population. New towns and cities have 
sprung up everywhere and have become important centers of 
trade and industry, while many of the older cities have spread 
over much of the adjacent territory, with an enormous increase 
in population. The numerons railways, the cheap and rapid 
transit from point to point, have completely revolutionized the 
old régime. Young people are no longer satisfied with the same- 
ness and monotony of country life; they want to get away 
from the drudgery of the farm to the gayety and pleasures of the 
city. Formerly the rural population was far greater than the 
urban population, but now the case is reversed. So true is it 
that often it is very difficult to find hands sufficient to make 
crops; while in the cities all employments, trades, and profes- 
sions are filled to overflowing; thousands are unemployed; com- 
petition in business of every kind is exceedingly sharp; profits 
are small and anxiety is great; the earnings of the working peo- 
ple are barely sufficient to pay rent and buy bread. Under con- 
ditions like these, the blind, unassisted, stand a very poor chance 
of making a livelihood. The few employments within the reach 
of the blind are very simple and easily learned, and because they 
are simple and easily learned the seeing engage in them exten-
-P-A-G-E-245
SEO A Gps 
sively, much to the detriment of the blind. Besides, it takes but 
-a small capital to begin and carry on any one of the trades 
taught in our schools. Thus the blind are shoved to the wall 
and are forced to beg, play street organs, or starve. Their edu- 
cation is of no practical use. They may beg more grammat- 
ically and keep their harmoniums in better tune, but that is all. 
It is questionable whether it is right to educate children ont of 
their station or surroundings—to give them refinement; to 
make them capable of enjoying the beauties of literature, the 
achievements of science, and the wonders of this ever-busy, ever- 
progressive world; to give them ambition and hope, a love for all 
that is beautiful and grand; to create in them a spirit of inde- 
pendence and self-respect ; to make them loathe dependence, pau- 
perism, idleness. And for what? Only to be thrust back into the 
slough of despond from whence they were taken; to be mocked, 
like Tantalus, with the view of the fruits and fountains of par- 
_adise; to feel cruel disappointment and hopeless sorrow. This 
is the European view of the helplessness of a great number of 
the blind, even after they have finished the prescribed course 
in their schools. 
The School for the Blind in Dresden, Saxony, inaugurated 
a parental supervision of its graduates which is known as the 
“ Saxon System.” The plan is this: The managers and direct- 
ors of the school interest. one or more gentlemen in every munici- 
pality or borough in the kingdom in procuring situations for 
those graduates qualified to teach or to fill the position of organ- 
ist or choir master in one of the numerous churches. So far the 
task is easy enough; but to find employment for those who must 
work at the trades they learn in the school is a more serious un- 
dertaking. Materials and tools are furnished at cost to the 
graduates, males or females, at their home, in their native town 
or village, if the surroundings are favorable; but if not favor- 
able, some advantageous point is selected, and the gentleman 
who consented to act as counselor and friend of the graduates 
finds a shop, boarding place, receives material, and starts the 
business. He also assists in disposing of the manufactured ar-
-P-A-G-E-246
eae 
ticles. If, however, all the articles are not sold, the school takes 
charge of what is left, giving credit to the workmen. Some of 
the more frugal and industrious are able in a short time to pay 
the cost of material furnished by the school; others take a much 
longer time; while others always depend for aid upon the school. 
In England the same system prevails, with some modifica- 
tions. Large shops have been established in various places, un- 
der the auspices of benevolent. societies, where employment is 
given to many blind persons. A market is found for the work; 
but if the receipts do not cover the expenses (and they rarely 
ever do), the society pays the deficit. So the shops continue 
from year to year, giving employment to thousands of blind 
men who would otherwise be on the parish. The workman earns 
from 50 cents to $1.50 per day. In this country there are only 
three such shops—viz., in Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Fran- 
cisco—and these three receive State aid. Outside the great 
cities of this country the conditions are entirely different from 
those prevailing in Europe. In the first place, America is not 
so thickly populated as Europe. Our people are much better 
off in every way. Most of them own the houses they live in 
and the ground they till, and those who rent make better wages 
than their brother craftsmen across the water. Wealth and all 
the good things it represents are more equally distributed here 
than there. The people who have plenty are able to give of 
their abundance. In the second place, in this country the strug- 
gle is not near so hard nor is competition so keen. When our 
pupils finish the school course, they return to their homes, and 
their relatives or friends soon start them in business of some 
kind. Tf they are wide awake and industrious, they succeed ; 
but if they are lazy or dissipated, they fail. 
I am aware that some eminent statesmen and professors of, 
social economics are strenuous advocates of the parental theory, 
a theory which would make the government owner and manager 
of all public and private enterprises—such as railroads, tele- 
graph lines, mines, factories, shipping, ete.—just as it owns and 
controls the postal service, the army, and the navy. Such a sys-
-P-A-G-E-247
oo 
tem, it is my opinion, would strangle individual enterprise and 
ambition. The spur to progress and success would no longer 
exist. The mediocre and the commonplace would be the only 
thing needed. Under such a rule the people would be like the 
pauper and the annuity man: both would be happy, because they 
would have no anxiety, nothing to worry them or to think about. 
It is our individuality—our love of freedom; our sense of respon- 
sibility; our desire to excel, to be leaders in thought and bene- 
factors of the race—that makes heroes; that gives the power to 
overcome all hindrances, to endure success, to survive disaster 
and afiliction. People deprived of opportunities to develop 
these high attributes are robbed of all that ennobles and glori- 
fies humanity. In like manner if schools practice parental su- 
pervision of their graduates, they become timid and easily dis- 
couraged. They have none of the self-reliance and self-respect 
which are the offspring of manly independence. To overcome 
difficulties by one’s own unaided efforts, to have experienced 
reverses and misfortunes, and yet to be victorious, is a pleasure 
and a pride that the dependent cannot appreciate. Another 
baneful effect of the system is that it takes from the pupils the 
incentive to study and the desire to excel. To know that they 
will be provided for, that they will be put in the way of making 
money, causes them to lose interest in the schoolroom, to rarely 
ever finish the course, and to leave poorly educated and unfit 
for any of the higher pursuits or callings of life. There are, 
however, eases where a little aid would smooth the rough places 
and enable a novice to get a foothold in the chosen profession ; 
but with the majority it would be very hurtful. In the words 
of the efficient secretary of the Columbia Polytechnic Institute 
for the Blind: “ Let every blind child come to know that he is 
expected by his parents, his friends, and the public to prepare 
himself to take his place among the workers in the world; let it 
become thoroughly understood by the people everywhere that 
blindness is no excuse for a life of idleness and mendicancy, 
and that self-respect, independence of thought and action may 
be preserved, even though the sight be lost, and you will make 
blindness a thousand times easier to bear.”

The year’s work was brought to a close by a delightful enter- 
tainment attended by a magnificent audience. Governor Me- 
Millin and wife, Comptroller King, and a large number of our 
best and most influential citizens honored us with their pres- 
ence. The graduating class consisted of 6 young ladies and 2 
young men. The 4 young ladies and 2 young men who received 
grammar diplomas were: Miss Eubanks, of Overton County ; 
Miss Martin, of Crockett County; Miss Zornes, of Davidson 
County; Miss Browning, of Weakley County; and Messrs. 
Woodward, of Giles County, and Newman, of Carroll County. 
Miss Francis, of Franklin County, and Miss Epperson, of Meigs 
County, received high school diplomas. Miss Francis and Mr. 
Newman also received medals for proficiency in Music. The 
Governor, in an eloquent speech, impressed upon the graduates 
that commencement exercises meant to them that they were 
about to commence life’s work, and that the preparation. received 
in the school fitted them to go out in the world with assurance of 
success. The Governor conferred diplomas and medals, Mr. 
_ Williams pronounced the benediction, and the audience was dis- 
missed. Respectfully submitted,

TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Sir: During the past year the Tennessee Deaf and Dumb 
School has shared in the awakened interest and general advance- 
ment in educational matters which have been so marked through- 
out the State. 
The attendance of the School has been good. The capacity 
of the institution has been taxed to the fullest extent, though 
we have not been compelled, until recently, to turn away any 
eligible pupils seeking admission. There are, however, quite 
a number of deaf children growing up in ignorance about us
-P-A-G-E-249
“ogg 
for whom additional accommodations should be provided as soon 
as practicable. This done, with the enlistment of the interest 
of the public school teachers throughout the State in getting all 
the deaf and dumb children in their respective neighborhoods 
into the School, the maximum benefit of the School to this class 
of the children of the State—and thus to the State itself—would 
scon be realized. 
Perhaps the origin, the purposes, and the work of the School 
cannot be too often presented to the public; and, with this view, 
I may appropriately include in this report matters which have 
heretofore been commented upon. 
The School was established by the General Assembly of the 
State in 1844, the organization and the beginning of work on 
a small scale occurring in the early part of 1845. Thus Ten- 
nessee was among the earlier States to take up the work of edu- 
cating the deaf and dumb, this School being the eighth organized 
in the United States. 
The institution is a School established for the purposes of 
education—a place of training for deaf children of the State, _ 
where they may obtain the means of putting themselves in com- 
munication with the world of work and knowledge and of be- 
coming a real, a helpful, part of that world. 
The method of instruction pursued here is known as “ the 
combined method,” writing, the manual alphabet, signs, and © 
articulate speech, all being used as means of communication, the 
attempt being made to use the means best adapted to the indi- 
vidual ease and to the existing circumstances. 
With quite a number of our pupils, oral instruction, by which 
pupils are taught speech ‘and lip reading, is very satisfactorily 
followed. Our methods are adapted to the instruction of those 
who because of deafness cannot be instructed in the ordinary 
schools for hearing children, and any child who is too deaf to 
be taught successfully in the public schools should be sent to a 
schoo] for the deaf. 
Instruction in the understanding and use of the English lan- 
guage is at once the chief purpose and difficulty of teaching the 
‘
-P-A-G-E-250
—245— 
deaf. In connection with this work the common-school branches 
are readily taught and acquired. 
Arithmetic, Geography, History, ete., as presented in the 
books on the State list, are mastered by the more advanced pu- 
pils as thoroughly as by hearing students. 
The absolute necessity for the deaf and dumb to know how to 
work and to rely in doing that work upon their own resources, 
if they would be self-supporting and useful members of the com- 
munity, leads us to give the individual feature of our work spe- 
cial attention and to try to train both boys and girls in habits of 
industry, efficiency, and neatness. 
The girls are taught general woman’s work—sewing, house- 
work, ete-—and the boys learn carpentry, shoemaking, and 
printing, besides getting experience in the general work about 
the premises. 
At the Colored Department, where we have considerable land, 
the boys take part in farm work and dairying and learn shoe- 
making. 
Nearly every county in the State is represented among the 
pupils, yet there are probably few counties which do not con- 
tain deaf children who should be in school, but are not. 
The present attendance is as follows:

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
  
Sir: I have the honor to present te you this, the fifteenth 
annual report of the Tennessee Industrial School. 
During the past year the children of the institution have been
-P-A-G-E-251
246—   
blessed in many ways. The health of the pupils has been good, 
end their deportment and progress in the various branches of 
work and study have been. exceedingly satisfactory, for all of 
which we have cause to be grateful. The institution is becom- 
ing more extensively known, and the merits of our work are 
more generally acknowledged. This statement is borne out by 
the fact that we are daily receiving applications from neighbor- 
ing States, as well as from the entire South, seeking admission 
for pupils. 
I would respectfully refer you to the itemized tables which 
accompany and form part of this report. From them it will be 
seen that we have received since opening 2,853 pupils, of which 
number 2,176 were white boys, 496 were white girls. and 181 
were colored boys. It will also be seen that there tave been 
dismissed since opening 2,060 children, of which number 1,655 
were white boys, 266 were white girls, and 136 were colored 
boys. There were remaining in the school on December 4, 
1901, 793 pupils, of which number 518 were white boys, 230 
were white girls, and 45 were colored boys. Of the total num- 
ber of pupils enrolled, 178 were pay pupils, 100 being paid for 
by Davidson County and 78 by parents and friends. We are 
still unable to meet the pressure of applications for admission 
which is constantly brought to bear upon the institution, both 
from the counties of this State and from residents of other 
States as well. There are very few of the counties of Tennessee 
which do not keep their quotas filled, and some few counties are 
requesting permission to enter children as pay pupils at the 
counties’ expense. 
During the past year we have received $91,098.54 from va- 
rious sources, and have expended $91,078.08 on subsistence, fur- 
nishing, and improvement account. This amount has been dis- 
tributed as follows: On subsistence, $76,812.40; on furnishing 
account, $3,851.59; and on improvements and repzirs, $10,- 
414.09. These amounts include special appropriations of $5,- 
000 for the purchase of a small Girls’ Department, together with 
nearly five acres of land, and the payment of our outstanding
-P-A-G-E-252
os 
indebtedness, amounting to $4,355. We also now have to our 
credit $3,500 in the State treasury for the purpose of building 
a crematory. 
The past season was favorable to vegetation, and our farm 
crops were more abundant than they were the previous year. 
We have rented about 140 acres of land, which has been de- 
voted principally to hay, sweet potatoes, and pasturage, and 
from which we have realized considerable forage for our live 
stock. We have also raised 600 barrels of Irish potatoes, 1,500 
barrels of sweet potatoes, and 1,800 barrels of turnips, all of 
which were properly stored for winter use. In addition, we 
have raised a sufficient quantity of the various vegetables for use 
in their seasons. Our live stock is in excellent condition. We 
have on hand at this time 18 horses, 8 mules, and 35 cows. 
The results obtained from our dairy are extremely favorable. 
We have equipped that department with steam churns, a cream 
separator, and other modern appliances, all of which have been 
placed in charge of a practical dairyman. We are realizing 
from this department all of the milk and the greater part of 
the butter used throughout the entire institution, which is by 
no means a small item. 
Our workshops and manual training features are a source of 
constant pleasure. ‘The children have at all times displayed 
a spirit of cheerful willingness in performing whatever duties 
have been assigned them, and have manifested an interest in, 
and a desire to thoroughly master, the trades and branches 
* taught. Tow well they have succeeded in this laudable desire 
is abundantly evidenced by the fact that few, if any, of the 
young men learning a business here fail to find steady employ- 
ment at good salaries after their dismissal from the institution. 
Of the 2,060 children who have left the School, many of them 
are engaged in most of the leading trades, and some have entered 
the professions; and many notable examples of their success 
might be cited. The children are engaged in the following 
trades and industries: Bookkeeping, Shorthand, Typewriting, 
Telegraphy, Architectural and Free-hand Drawing, Printing,
-P-A-G-E-253
—248— 
Cabinetmaking, Wood Carving, Furniture Finishing, Carpen- 
try, Sloyd Training, Mattress Making, Upholstering, Painting, 
Barber Shop Work, Broom Making, Tailoring, Blacksmithing, 
Bread Baking, Harness Making and Shoemaking, Store Keep- 
ing, Steam Laundering, work in Machine Shops, care of Steam 
Boilers, Plumbing, Farming, Vegetable Gardening, Fruit Gar- 
dening, Floriculture, and work in Hotbeds, Vineyards, Barn, and 
care of Stock. Each of these various departments is helpful to 
the institution and children alike. All of the shoes, clothing, 
furniture, brooms, ete., consumed and used by the institution are 
made by the pupils. 
We raise all of our vegetables and do our own printing, car- 
pentering, painting, and general plumbing repairs. ‘The prac- 
tieability of maintaining each of the foregoing departments is 
unquestionable; it is of economical value, and, which is of greater 
import, is helpful to the children. This economical product is 
an important factor in solving the problem of feeding, clothing, 
and educating a child on an annual per capita allowance of $100. 
In their school work the children are also doing nicely, and 
their conduct and advancement have been. satisfactory. Gen- 
eral examinations for promotion are held annually, and indi- 
vidual test examinations for promotion are given as often as 
there may be cause for them. The daily school hours are di- 
0 vided into two sessions, the morning session extending from 7 
until 11 o’clock; the afternoon session, from 1 until 5 o’clock. 
The advantages of this system are many, inasm7ch as it is made 
possible by its adoption to keep both manual and literary 
branches in operation during the entire day, thus affording op- 
portunities to a greater number of children to devote a portion 
of their time to some useful course of training. It also affords 
each child more time and attention from both mechanical and 
literary teachers, insuring a more thorough understanding and 
more rapid advancement. As only lady teachers are employed 
in the literary departments, every child is placed for about five 
hours each day under the management and influence of ladies. 
Our musie departments continue to support the reputation
-P-A-G-E-254
—249— 
they have established. Our brass band, composed of boys be- 
tween the ages of twelve and seventeen. years, is generally and 
favorably known throughout the State. There are also classes 
in Vocal and Instrumental Music in each of the several depart- 
ments, which are arranged for and directed by competent. teach- 
ers. : 
The official force of the institution has been. effective in its ; 
efforts, collectively and individually, to promote the general 
welfare and advancement of the children. Many of these work- 
ers are young people who have been beneficiaries of the insti- 
tution’s training—young people who, as pupils, have been edu- 
cated and made useful for the work they are now performing. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
W. C. KILVINGTON, Superintendent.   
WATKINS INSTITUTE. 
  
Sir: The Commissioners of the Watkins Institute present 
herewith the detailed report of Prof. W. R. Garrett, Superin- 
tendent of the Night School, showing the management, progress, 
course of study, and attendance of the school for its last session. 
This free public school is one of the most admirably conducted 
institutions of its class in the country, and its attendance and 
usefulness are increasing yearly. The number of students at 
the opening of the session—in August, 1902—was far ereater 
than in any previous year. The manifold advantages of the 
school have attracted very general attention, and have recently 
led to its further endowment by a benevolent resident of the city, 
the late Mrs. Ann E. Webber, who, prior to her death, conveyed 
to the State of Tennessee, for the enlargement of the facilities 
of the school, real estate in the city of Nashville valued at from 
$75,000 to $80,000. The Commissioners hope that this gener- 
ous additional endowment may enable them to greatly add to the 
usefulness of the school, both by lengthening the term and add-  
-P-A-G-E-255
  
950— 
ing to the courses of instruction, and to build up an educational 
institution that will be of great value to the State, and particu- 
larly to a class of people who can secure education in no other 
way. : 
Since the last report was made to the State by the Commis- 
sioners, Hon. John M. Lea (who was largely instrumental in 
calling the attention of Mr. Watkins to the necessity for a school 
of this kind, who was also largely instrumental in its organiza- 
tion and gave to it more-than twenty years of efficient and patri- 
otic service) has, on account of advanced years and failing 
health, resigned his position as commissioner. We take this 
opportunity of placing upon record our thanks and appreciation 
for these eminent services rendered to the State and the cause 
of education by Judge Lea. 
The Commissioners will submit a full financial statement of 
the condition of the Watkins Institute to the next session of the | 
General Assembly. J. HILL EAKIN, President; 
JOHN M. BASS,

_ SCHOOLS FOR THE COLORED. 
FISK UNIVERSITY. 
Sir: Fisk University aims to be a great center of the best Chris- 
tian educational forces for the training of the colored youth of 
the South, that they may be rightly disciplined and inspired for 
leaders in the vitally important work that needs to be done for 
their race. The purpose of establishing for the colored people 
of the South a University that should adequately provide for 
them the advantages of Christian education, to whatever ex- 
tent the capacity and energy of the race should in the future 
demand, has been rigidly adhered to throughout the existence 
of the University. : 
To thoroughly establish among the colored youth the convic- 
tion of the absolute necessity of patient, long-continued, exact, 
and comprehensive work in preparation for high positions and 
large responsibilities is fundamental to the accomplishment of 
the true mission of the University. Solid, radical, and perma- 
nent results have been sought in all methods of work. 
Fisk University is situated in a commanding position on the 
northwestern edge of the city of Nashville. On its beautiful 
campus of 35 acres are placed 8 large brick buildings, besides 
several \ooden ones, and 6 residences owned by members of the 
faculty. The faculty consists of 6 regularly appointed pro- 
fessors and 20 assistant professors, instructors, and other offi- 
cials, including graduates of Amherst, Dartmouth, Oberlin, 
Syracuse, Sinith, Wellesley, Yale, and other prominent colleges 
ond universities. 
The work done at Fisk University compares favorably in ex- 
tent and thoroughness with that at schools of the same size in the 
North. Graduates from Fisk University can graduate from 
Northern colleges with from one to two years more of study. An 
A.B. from Fisk University admits the one who holds it to the
-P-A-G-E-259
oe . 
best professional schools of the country. Work actually done here 
is generally considered equal in quality to the work done in the 
North. Moreover, the scope of the education is not bounded 
by the work of the class room, but in the dormitories and in the 
Boarding Department general cultivation of character and im- 
provement in manners and the development of true Christian 
conduct are kept continually in mind, and the influence of the 
home life is probably one of the most potent influences for good 
in the University. The enthusiasm and loyalty of the alumni 
show the spirit produced by this system. 
In the College Department two courses of study are offered. 
The regular course includes both Latin and Greek, but a Latin 
Scientific Course has been recently added for those who prefer 
Science to Greek. A high standard is set, and the effects are 
shown in the high grade of work done by graduates and the ex- 
cellent positions which they hold. 
The Normal Course has recently been enlarged by the addi- 
tion of a year, and its graduates are fitted for positions in any 
public schools in the country. A special feature is the graduate 
course in kindergarten work. 
The College Preparatory Department has a three-years’ 
course, which will be changed to four years as soon as the neces- 
sary funds can be secured. 
The Theological Department offers, in addition to the regular 
course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, an English 
Course and a Bible Course for lay workers. Although under 
Congregational auspices, students from any evangelical chureh 
will be welcomed. Some among its graduates are now serving 
churches of other denominations, and it is hoped that this ele- 
ment in the student body will increase. 
The Department of Music is the best connected with any col- 
ored school. Only those can graduate who have a thorough 
knowledge of their subject, and most advantageous positions are 
quickly open to them. Many who take Music in addition to 
their literary work find it a great help in finding good positions 
as teachers.

The aim of the founders and supporters of Fisk University 
has ever been to make the institution thoroughly and earnestly 
Christian. All methods of work are devised for the purpose of 
making our students strong, earnest, broad-minded, Christian 
men and women, who shall give their lives to the uplifting and 
benefiting of their people. 
The total attendance during the last session was 498. 
J. G. MERRILL, President. 
KNOXVILLE COLLEGE. 
Sir: I have the honor to report another successful year in 
Knoxville College. 
The total attendance in all the departments was 303. There 
were graduated from the Normal Department, 12; from the 
College Department, 4. 
Knoxville College is located at Knoxville, Tenn., under the 
control of the Board of Missions to the Freedmen of the United 
Presbyterian Church of North America. It was founded in 
1875. Its departments include the full College Course, The- 
ological Course, Normal Course, and Training School. Be 
sides this, there is a very rapidly-growing Industrial Depart- 
ment. These departments have been very largely developed 
during the past year. An addition to the Agricultural Depart- 
ment now puts under the direct control of the College over 100 
acres of land. A dairy of 15 cows is maintained, in which the 
care of stock, management of milk, and butter making are taught 
ina scientific way. Intensive farming is taught in a most prac- 
tical way. It is the aim to provide as far as possible the sup- 
ply for the Boarding Department of 200 boarders, and two 
crops are taken from the larger part of the farm. Poultry rais- 
ing and greenhouse plant culture are also given attention. An 
electric light plant, run entirely by the students, lights all 
the buildings; and a steam heating plant, also run by the
-P-A-G-E-261
—256— 
students, heats all the buildings. A Printing Department, run 
under the direction of a thorough and practical printer, does 
all the College printing, and, besides, does a great deal of work 
for outside parties. A large cylinder press does the heavy work, 
while a job press does the lighter work. Classes in wood-work 
are taught the Sloyd system. This is taught in grades in 
the Training School. Instruction in carpentering is given un- 
der the direction of a practical carpenter. A large brickyard 
gives employment to students during vacation. and teaches them 
the trade. A bakery has been installed, with a capacity of 100 
loaves at a baking. Domestic Science and Sewing are depart- 
ments in which instruction is given under the most thorough 
teachers. All the girls in the institution are required to take 
a course in these departments. 
The College plant consists of nine buildings, situated on one 
of the hills made historic by the siege of Knoxville during the 
Civil War. The property is valued at $110,000. During the 
past year there have been 11 State Normal students under ap- 
pointment by State Senators, and thus entitled to the State Nor- 
mal scholarship of $50. 
The work of the College is best seen in the lives of those who 
have gone out from it. The profession of teaching claims the 
larger number; but these, for the most part, do not confine their 
efforts to one profession, but teach both by precept and example 
some manual art—farming, sewing, printing, or some other 
useful occupation. 
While in College, students are taught that labor is honorable. 
They are encouraged to 20 back to their homes and devote their 
lives to the uplifting of their fellow-beings in the communities 
in which they have been brought up. 
The expenses in the College are merely nominal. Tuition 
is only 50 cents a month. Boarding, heat, light, furnished 
room, and tuition are charged at the rate of $6.35 a month. 
Very little charity help is given; but by furnishing work to 
worthy students and keeping the expenses at the very lowest, 
self-help is encouraged and the foundation is laid for useful citi- 
zenship. R. W. WGRANAHAN, President.

ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
  
Sir: I have the honor to report that the past scholastic year 
was one of steady and effective work. 
At the beginning of the year the curriculum was improved 
by the introduction of Nature Study, in which the students of 
the English Department are taught to make original investiga- 
tion with regard to the familiar rocks, plants, and animals, and 
to use such results as the basis of oral and written work in Eng- 
lish. They are thus taught at the beginning of their course hab- 
its of close observation and accurate statement, and are given 
as subjects of their compositions, ete., matters in which they 
have a personal interest and about which they have something 
to tell, : 
A census of the students present in chapel one morning near 
the end of the school year showed that about one-fourth of all 
those present had taught school in the previous summer vacation 
an average of about three months each, with enrollments rang- 
ing from 23 to 150. The total of such enrollments was 1,465. 
If this average were applied to the other twenty or twenty-five 
years during which work similar to the present has been done, 
it would show that more than 30,000 children in the various 
country districts have felt the indirect influence of this school 
from year to year through the labors of the student body, quite 
‘in addition to the influence of the school upon its own students 
and through its large body of alumni. 
The work in the Printing Department has been more exten- 
sive and, on the whole, more effective than for some years past. 
The same may be said of the work in sewing and dressmaking. 
All girls, unless already proficient, are required to do regular 
work in all kinds of sewing, mending, darning, ete., and those 
who desire are given professional training in dressmaking. 
Nearly 600 different articles for school and private use were 
made in the Sewing Department during the year. 
The total attendance during the past term was 221.

LANE COLLEGE. 
  
Sir: I have the honor to report another successful—and, in 
many respects, a satisfactory—session of Lane College, begin- 
ning on September 13, 1901, and ending on May 29, 1902. 
When the Civil War began, in 1861, the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, had in its membership over 200,000 colored 
members. The war having closed and the relation of the col- 
ored people being changed, it was deemed wise to organize the 
colored membership into a church of their own. Accordingly, 
Bishop H. N. McTyeire, Bishop Robert Paine, and others met 
the colored representatives in the city of Jackson, Tenn., in 
December, 1870. The meeting resulted in the organization of 
what is known as the ‘ Colored Methodist Episcopal Church.” 
The leaders in this new church soon saw the necessity of schools 
of their own. In the fall of 1878, in the city of Nashville, at 
a session of the Tennessee Conference of said church, the project 
of establishing a school was begun. Property was purchased in 
Jackson and a house was erected. In 1882 the first session was 
opened, and the school was called the “ High School of the 
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church,’ and two years later it 
was chartered under the laws of Tennessee as ‘‘ Lane Institute.” 
Necessities multiplied as the institution prospered. Bishop 
Isaac Lane began to travel abroad with a view of raising money 
for the erection of a more commodious school building and 
boarding departments for its increasing patronage. In 1897 
the new house was completed. It is a neat, three-story brick 
building, with thirteen recitation rooms. Separate boarding 
departinents for boys and girls have been built and furnished. 
In 1895 its name was changed to “ Lane College,” in honor of 
Bishop Lane, who had done so much for it. The church is 
greatly indebted to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, 
for the financial and moral support it has given the school. Be- 
sides giving largely to the establishment of the school, it has 
furnished the services of one of its worthy members, who has 
served the school acceptably as President for the past thirteen
-P-A-G-E-264
=i 
years. Otherwise it is supported in its finances entirely by the 
Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. 
Since the organization of the College it has sent out 150 grad- 
uates from the Normal Department, many of whom are filling 
responsible positions, giving satisfaction, and making good citi- 
zens. The students appointed by Senators for the State Normal 
scholarships are doing well, and are worthy of the help given 
them by the State. 
The last session was prosperous, the College having more ad- 
vanced students in all of the departments. From the Normal 
Course 2 graduated and 10 finished the College Preparatory 
Course. The total attendance was 209.

To the Chairman of the County Court: 
Dear Sir: The State Board of Education has fixed Monday, 
Tuesday, and Wednesday, October 6, 7, and 8, 1902, as the 
time, and the courthouse at the county seat as the place, for 
the examination of those who desire to become candidates for 
the office of County Superintendent. It is your duty, under 
the law, to appoint three good, capable citizens of your county 
to conduct this examination—men: who are neither interested 
nor related to any of the applicants for office. Please make 
these appointments and send me at once the name and post 
office address of each of the three men selected by you, so that 
I may send questions and instructions to them. 
Yours very truly,

To County Superintendents: 
Under the Acts of 1895, Chapter 54, as amended by the Acts 
of 1899, Chapter 231, there will be held at the county seat of 
each county in the State, on October 6, 7, and 8, am examina- 
tion of persons who desire to become candidates for the office 
of County Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-281
Sg 
In order that those interested may acquaint themselves with 
the law defining the qualifications and duties of Superintend- 
ents and prescribing the manner of this examination, I quote 
so much of the Acts of 1873, subsequently amended, as relates 
to County Superintendents. The law provides that a Super- 
intendent shall be elected by the County Court at its January 
term, biennially, for a term of two years, and shall receive such 
compensation for his services as that court may allow him, pay- 
able upon warrant of its chairman. The Acts of 1873, as 
amended to date, provide that— 
“Said County Superintendent shall be a person of. literary 
and scientific attainments and of skill in the theory and prac- 
~ tice of teaching; provided, that preceding each biennial elec- 
tion, or any election to fill a vacaney for County Superintend- 
ent of Schools, each applicant shall file with the chairman of the 
County Court a certificate of qualification, given by the State 
Board of Edueation; provided, that on the first Monday in Oc- 
tober preceding each biennial election for County Superintend- 
ent of Schools, and at any other date or dates fixed by the State 
Board of Education, each applicant for said office shall undergo 
a public examination at the county site of the county in which 
he or she is an applicant, by and before a commission of three 
residents of the county, said commission to be previously ap- 
pointed by the chairman of the County Court, and to be citi- 
zens who, by education and experience, are most eminently 
qualified to hold said examination, the same to be held under 
such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the State 
Board of Education; provided, that if qualified as attested by 
said examination, said applicant shall receive a certificate of 
qualification by the State Board of Education.” (Chapter 54, 
Acts of 1895.) 
“Provided, further, that those who have been. previously ca- 
amined or may hereafler be examined under the regulations of 
the State Board of Hducation, and having attained 90 per cent 
in general average, and not falling below 70 per cent in any
-P-A-G-E-282
ge 
study, shall be exempt from said examination so long as they 
continue in the public school work. 
“In the election of County Superintendent of Education, 
women of the age of twenty-one years, and otherwise possessing 
the necessary qualifications, shall be eligible for said position.” 
The law quoted states clearly the method of examination and 
the conditions upon which certificates are issued. You will 
note that the Act of 1899 provides that persons holding cer- 
tificates with a general average of 90 per cent, and not falling 
below 70 per cent on any subject, shall be exempt from examina- 
tion so long as they continue in. public school work. This 
means that an applicant holding the certificate must have a 
grade of at least 70 per cent on each subject, and the general 
average must be at least 90 per cent on the subjects required 
to be taught in the public schools. If a person should have 90 
per cent on every subject except one, and then have no grade at 
all or a grade below 70 per cent on one subject, his certificate 
would not qualify him for election. There are some certificates 
in existence that have no grades at all upon some subjects, and 
the holders of such certificates must be reéxamined. 
The law must be strictly complied with, and persons who 
may be named by County Courts for the position of County 
Superintendent, who have not received certificates in accord- 
ance with the law and regulations of the State Board of Educa- 
tion, will not, be recognized by this department. The law also 
provides that the applicant must be actually engaged in public 
school work in order to receive benefits from former examina- 
tions. 
I issue this circular in advance of the examination, in order 
that those who contemplate becoming candidates for County 
Superintendent may know the law and the rulings of this de 
partment under it. MORGAN ©. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent.

INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING THE EXAMINATION 
OF CANDIDATES FOR COUNTY 
SUPERINTENDENTS. 
. STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pustic Insrruction, 
Nashville, September 25, 1902. 
The examination of those who expect to be candidates for 
County Superintendent will be held on October 6, 7, and 8 at 
the county seat, and on no other date. Questions have been 
prepared upon every subject provided by law to be taught in 
the public schools. ‘These questions are mailed direct to the 
Examining Board in three envelopes, upon the outside of which 
are indicated the subjects contained in them and the date when 
such subjects shall be given to applicants.
-P-A-G-E-284
—279— 
The Board of Examiners shall meet daily at 8: 30 each morn- 
ing, and, in the presence of the applicants, break the seal and 
open the envelope containing questions for that day only. The 
questions should be placed upon a blackboard, subject by sub- 
ject, and each subject should be completed before another is 
placed upon the board. No communication shall be permitted 
among applicants, and it would be best if they could occupy 
separate seats. After questions are placed upon the board, no 
applicant should be permitted to leave the room until the ex- 
amination upon, that subject is completed. If the applicant 
does leave the room, then such person should not be permitted 
te answer questions then on the board upon his return. 
I recommend that the Board, after the first morning, fix the 
hour for opening, closing, and dinner. So arrange the exami- 
nation that the subject upon the board will be entirely com- 
pleted before adjournment for dinner and that in. the afternoon 
the subject then upon the board shall be completed before ad- 
journment for the day. 
The especial duty of the three men appointed by the chair- 
man of the County Court is to see that this examination is con- 
ducted fairly and impartially. Simply place the questions 
upon the board; let each applicant for himself answer the ques- 
tions; do not permit conversation among applicants or friends; 
let the examination be so condtcted that there can be no ques- 
tion about its fairness. I desire that the applicants receive 
grades upon their answers fairly and freely made, without as- 
sistance from any source. 
Let each applicant write his name and address and county 
upon every sheet of paper used in answering the questions, so 
that the papers may not be confused when transmitted to me. 
When the examination is completed, all papers should be 
packed in one bundlt and either mailed or expressed to me at 
Nashville, and with them this certificate: 
“The examination of applicants for County Superintendent 
was conducted by the committee appointed by the chairman, 
and in accordance with the regulations of the State Superin-
-P-A-G-E-285
tendent in every respect. No communication was permitted 
among applicants, and no aid was allowed any person; and in 
all other respects the specifie instructions of the State Super- 
intendent were followed, and this examination was honestly, 
fairly, and impartially conducted.” 
The questions should be returned to this office at once,, so 
that papers can be graded and applicants notified of the result.

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department oF Pustic Instruction, 
Nashville, November 20, 1901. 
To County Superintendents and Members of the Several County 
Courts: 
The Fifty-first, General Assembly passed an Act designated as 
the “ County High School Law.” This statute provides for the 
creation, by the County Court, of a County Board of Education, 
consisting of seven members, one of whom shall be the County 
Superintendent. This Board shall have power to establish one 
or more county high schools in the county and to maintain such 
school or schools out of any funds designated for that purpose. 
Section 2 of the Act provides that “ the County Court, for the 
purpose aforesaid, shall have power to levy special taxes, in ad- 
dition to other taxes, for school purposes, not to exceed 15 cents 
on the $100, on all taxable property—to be levied and collected 
as other county taxes; and the said court shall also have power, 
for the purpose aforesaid, to make appropriations out of any 
county funds not otherwise appropriated, except out of the pub- 
lic school funds; and the funds arising from the taxes levied for 
the purpose and the appropriation made for the purpose shall 
constitute a special fund, to be known as the ‘ County High 
School Fund,’ which shall be kept by the County Trustee sep- 
arate and apart from all other funds and applied exclusively 
to the purpose aforesaid.” 
When the County Board of Education is created by the County 
Court and taxes are levied for high school purposes, the County 
Board can then establish one or more county high schools and 
apply the County High School Fund to the support and main- 
tenance of such institution. The law authorizes the erection, 
by the Board, of a new high school building, and empowers the
-P-A-G-E-319
—314— 
Board, where conditions warrant them in so doing, to consoli- 
date the county high school with some public school, county or 
city, or even a private school already established. Not less than 
three teachers shall be employed in any county high school, and 
the school “ shall be open to all children of the county of lawful 
age who shall be otherwise qualified, and who have completed 
the Primary School Course, or its equivalent, as tested by exam- 
ination or such regulations as may be provided by the Board 
for the admission, of pupils; provided, that schools shall be sep- 
arate for white and colored children.” No tuition can be 
charged children of the county desiring to attend this school. 
A course of study must be arranged by the Board, which shall 
inelude every subject required to be taught in our public schoois, 
except those in the first five grades; and, in addition, the Board 
may provide such high-school branches as are necessary and ex- 
pedient. The purpose of the Act is to establish, in fact, a 
county high school, with a course of study equal to that of 
standard high schools throughout the country. The county high 
school Act will be found on page 37 of the recent edition, of the 
Public School Laws, issued by this department, and on, page 
é71, Acts of 1899. This law, providing for the creation of 
county high schools, makes this institution a creature of the 
County Court; and it is controlled by that honorable body, 
through a Board of its own selection, and not through the reg- 
ular State and district authorities. It is the peculiar privilege 
of the County Court to create the County Board and through it 
to establish a county high school, and thus to provide in each 
county for the completion of its entire system of school education 
an institution so wisely recommended by Thomas Jefferson in 
the same year in which our independence as a nation was de- 
clared. Jefferson stated at that early date that it was the duty 
of the people in each county to establish a county high school, 
or county college, where all the children of the county might be 
given a fair education and receive training in the duties of citi- 
zenship within the borders of their own county. 
We now have the primary school in all the districts of the
-P-A-G-E-320
—315— 
State; and in every district where conditions demand and public 
funds justify, secondary schools have been established. In or- 
der to complete our system, as was certainly the intention of 
its founders, we must establish in each county the county high 
school, open to all the children of the county alike. More than 
2,000 children of the State complete annually the course of 
study provided in the school of their locality, and it is the pur- 
pose of this law to give this class of students a home school free, 
which will prepare them either for the duties of life or for en- 
trance to a college or university. If this high school is estab- 
lished in your county, this class of young men and young women 
will receive further school training and derive substantial ben- 
efits, for which they will, in the remaining days of their lives, 
bless the wisdom and patriotism of your honorable County 
Court. 
This law has my unqualified approval; and I urge you, as 
officials and citizens, to bring the matter before the County 
Court at its January term and to codperate heartily with the 
friends of education in Tennessee in this important work. 
Prompt, vigorous, and intelligent effort will accomplish much 
for our common cause. MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pusric Instruction, 
Nashville, April 3, 1902. 
To County Superintendents: 
The Act of 1873 providing for our present system of public 
schools and subsequent amendatory legislation make it the duty 
of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction “ to prescribe 
the mode of examining and licensing school-teachers and. their 
necessary qualifications.” (Section 7, Subsection 9, Acts cf 
1873.) 
It shall be the duty of the County Superintendent “to per-
-P-A-G-E-321
—316— 
form such duties in relation to the examination of teachers and 
issuing to them certificates of qualification as may be required 
of him by the State Superintendent.” (Section 9, Subsec- 
tion 4.) : 
“No teacher of public schools shall be employed, or receive 
any pay from the nublic funds, unless he or she have a certificate 
of qualification given to him or her by the County Superin- 
tendent for the county within'which he or she is employed; and 
no such payment shall be allowed if made, and any officer who 
shall make or sanction it shall also be subject to a penalty of not 
Jess than $5 nor more than $50; and for like services of male 
and female teachers, like salaries shall be paid.” (Section 26, 
Chapter 25, Acts of 1873.) 
“ No certificate shall. be granted to any person to teach in the 
public schools of this State after the first day of January, 1895, 
who has not passed a satisfactory examination in Physiology 
and Hygiene, with special reference to the effects of alcoholic 
drinks and narcotics and cigarette smoking upon the human sys- 
tem.” (See Acts of 1895.) 
“ Diplomas: shall be granted to those who honorably complete 
the course of study prescribed in Normal Schools éstablished by 
the State Board of Education; and the possession of such di- 
ploma shall exempt the holder thereof from the examination 
prescribed as a condition precedent to employment in the pub- 
lic schools of the State, any such graduate being eligible as a 
teacher in any county of the State.” (Section 54, Subsec- 
tion 8.) 
References to sections refers to the last edition of the public 
school laws issued in pamphlet form from this department. 
REGULATIONS OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
~ Under authority of the State Board of Education, the Pea- 
body College for Teachers, at Nashville, issues certificates and 
diplomas to graduates, which exempt the holders from examina- 
tion before the County Superintendents. 
“Parties holding Roll of Honor Certificates issued by the
-P-A-G-E-322
—317— 
State Peabody Institutes shall be exempt from examination for 
Teachers’ Certificates in any of.the counties in the State, pro- 
vided that no certificate hereafter issued by any such Institute or 
Conductor thereof shall be good for a period exceeding four 
years from date of issuance.” (Minute Book, 1899.) 
Heretofore Life Certificates have been issued exempting teach- 
ers from further examination ; but the above action of the State 
Board means that Life Certificates are forbidden, and that all 
who stand examinaticns this year, or any succeeding year, shall 
be granted certificates which will expire four years from date, 
instead of for life. This ruling does not interfere with parties 
row holding Life Certificates. 
“All persons who are exempt from examination for Teachers’ 
Certificates by authority of the State Board of Education. shall 
conform to the requirements of the State Superintendent as to 
the time when said persons shal! make application to the County 
Superintendent for Teachers’ Certificates.” (Minute Book, 
1895, page 29.) 
REGULATIONS OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT AS TO GRADES OF

in the primary schools and in Theory and Practice of Teaching; 
and Primary Certificates, good for one year, will be issued, with- 
out examination, to applicants who have completed the course 
of study for the first year in any State Peabody Institute, pro- 
vided that such certificates shall not be issued without examina- 
tion after one year from the time such State Peabody Institute

Orthography, 
Reading, 
Writing, 
Mental Arithmetic,

Physiology and Hygiene, 
Theory and Practice of Teaching and School Law. 
TIMES OF EXAMINATIONS. 
County Superintendents are directed to hold public examina- 
tions at the following times and to give no private examinations: 
Annual examination, first Friday and Saturday in July. 
Second examination, first Friday and Saturday in August. 
Quarterly examination, first Friday and Saturday in October. 
Quarterly examination, first Friday and Saturday in January. 
Quarterly examination, first Friday and Saturday in March.
-P-A-G-E-324
—319.   
Make arrangements so that the annual examination will ocenr 
during the County Institute or at its termination. 
All certificates expire at the close of the scholastic year, 
June 30. 
Instructions are hereby given to Superintendents not to issue 
a certificate to any applicant, graduate of the Peabody College 
for Teachers, or to a person holding a State Institute Certificate, 
at any other time than the dates herein specified. If the two 
days named are not sufficient to conclude the examination of 
applicants, the Superintendent should continue from day to day 
until the work is finished ; but it is desirable to have the exami- 
nation completed during these two days. Superintendents 
should have thcir examination at the times suggested, without 
exception, and should have uniform dates for examination and 
uniformity in the method of testing the teacher’s ability and 
scholarship. Do not hold private or individual examinations 
under any circumstances. No condition of facts will justify 
the Superintendent to grant such unwise favors. Treat. all 
teachers with absolute justice and impartiality. This can more 
easily he done by following these instructions. 
Fix the time and place for the examination, announce before- 
hand the number of hours to be consumed daily, and then follow 
your announcement; make no exception for or against any per- 
scn ; do not permit personal consideration, importunities of either 
teachers or influential friends to influence you one way or the 
other; discharge your duty faithfully to the publie and deal 
impartially with every teacher. : 
T recommend a thorough, practical, and uniform examination 
on the subjects as required by law. Examinations in themselves 
are not an infallible test of qualification ; but the law has made 
it your duty to examine teachers, and in many instances strict 
examinations prevent incompetent teachers from imposing upon 
the public. While examinations are one test, ability to teach, 
moral character, good citizenship, and general deportment of the 
‘teacher should be in every case prerequisites to the issuance of 
a certificate. Those who have failed as teachers and those of
-P-A-G-E-325
oO 
doubtful character should not be licensed. The teacher is an 
exemplar in the community, and there should be no doubt of his 
good standing and moral character. You have no legal or other 
right to license any person to teach school in this State who is 
not in every way worthy, capable, and thoroughly qualified. 
Teachers in our public schools must be of the highest moral 
character and personal worth. License no others, it matters not 
how high their grades nor how powerful the infiuences behind 
them, 
The Superintendent has the right to investigate questions of 
this character and to use his good judgment and sound discretion 
in either issuing a certificate or refusing to do so. A Teachers’ 
Institute should be held annually in each county, and it is the 
duty of teachers to attend the Institute and all educational bod- 
ies in their county and State. The most capable teachers, with- 
out exception, attend these meetings; and the Superintendent, 
in examining and licensing teachers, should give every encour- 
agement to such persons. Heretofore I have endeavored in 
every way possible to raise the standard of teachers in the public 
schools, and have, accordingly, directed Superintendents in all 
the counties, without exception, to examine their teachers annu- 
ally. I think this the surest method of obtaining capable per- 
sons to teach our schools. This year, however, I want the Su- 
perintendents to use limited discretion in this matter. If you 
have in your county a teacher of experience, ability, and un- 
questioned character—a person who has been for a reasonable 
time actively engaged in teaching, in attendance upon Teachers’ 
Institutes and other educational associations, and whose exami- 
nation last year was of a high grade—then I do not think it 
would be improper for the Superintendent to issue a certificate 
without examination. Where the Superintendent exercises this 
discretion, it should be with the greatest care. The director in 
most cases employs a teacher primarily upon the certificate of 
the County Superintendent. You are charged with the grave 
responsibility of passing upon the teacher’s qualifications. The 
law empowers me to prescribe the manner of examination, and
-P-A-G-E-326
—321—— 
it is your duty to comply with the requirements of the State 
Superintendent. 
If our teachers are excellent and capable, it is because the 
Superintendent has done his duty without fear or favor; if our. 
schools are properly taught, it will be because the Superintendent 
and directors have faithfully followed the law and these in- 
structions. I believe that Superintendents, directors, and teach- 
ers desire a higher standard in teaching, improvement in meth- 
ods, and prosperity in our public schools, and that the State 
Superintendent will have their codperation in carrying into 
effect. the letter and spirit of the law prescribing the method of 
examining and licensing teachers. It is unlawful for a director 
to employ a teacher until such teacher has a certificate from 
the County Superintendent covering the period of time during 
which such teacher proposes to engage in teaching. All cer- 
tificates expire on June 30 annually, and contracts are neces- 
sarily limited according to the life of the teacher’s certificate. 
TEACHERS EXI.MPT FROM EXAMINATION. 
1. Graduates of the Peabody College for Teachers. 
2. Graduates of the State Peabody Institutes, upon presen- 
tation of either diplomas or certificates signed by the State Su- 
perintendent and the Conductor and Secretary of the Institute. 
The fact that the teacher is a graduate of some school or col- 
lege does not free him from examination. A public school cer- 
tificate or diploma is not a certificate to teach. The certificates 
issued to applicants for County Superintendent by the State 
Board of Education do not entitle their holders to certificates 
without examination. One County Superintendent has no an- 
thority to renew or duplicate a certificate issued by another Su- 
perintendent. When such courtesies are practiced, they are 
clear violations of the law and are in total disregard of these 
instructions. The safe method to pursue is to examine annually - 
ali public school teachers in each county and grant no favor 
which might impair the public service. 
I issue this official communication setting forth in detail ree- 
12
-P-A-G-E-327
—322— 
ulations for examining and licensing teachers. This should 
govern Superintendents, directors, and teachers in matters of 
this character until the next general instructions are issued from 
this department. MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK,

To County and City Superintendents: 
I respectfully call your attention to Sections 323-331 of the 
school law with regard to the examination for free scholarships 
in the University of Tennessee. This law makes it your official 
duty to give due notice thereof and to hold this examination. 
I inclose blanks furnished for that purpose by the registrar of 
the University. Please give such notice of the examination as 
you can in your county paper or otherwise. There is no ap- 
propriation for paying for this advertisement. I also inclose a 
full explanation of the examination and instructions for the ex- 
aminers, with a sealed envelope containing the questions, which 
is not to be opened until the day for the examination. See also 
the Register of the University, pages 17-19. The date of the 
examination should be fixed and announced at once, and I’sug-

gest that it would be well to have it about the close of the present 
term of school. 
Please acknowledge this and notify me of the time and place

To County Superintendents: : 
I have located ten State Peabody Institutes for the teachers 
of Tennessee-—seven for white teachers and three for colored 
teachers of the State. The Institutes are located at the fol- 
lowing places, with dates as indicated: 
For White Teachers—Martin, June 9; Jackson, June 9; 
Clarksville, June 16; Columbia, June 16; Cookeville, June 
23; Cleveland, June 30; Jonesboro, June 30. 
For Colored Teachers—Nashyille, June 16; Memphis, June 
16; Knoxville, June 16. 
I have endeavored to place State Institutes at such points in 
each grand division as will be convenient and accessible to the 
largest number of teachers. While the places indicated have 
been selected with especial view to accessibility, all the places 
chosen are well suited for educational meetings. I give you 
this information now, with the hope that you will arrange your 
Institute work so as to avoid conflict with the State Institutes 
and permit as many of your teachers as desire to attend a State 
Institute to do so. I deem it unnecessary to repeat and re- 
emphasize the value and great importance of this character ¢

A State Normal Institute has been located at Cookeville, 
Tenn., to begin on Monday, June 23, 1902, and continue four 
weeks. This Institute is free to all white teachers who will 
attend it, and the public and private school-teachers of the Upper 
Cumberland counties are especially urged to take anvantage of 
this practical and valuable Institute work. Capt. C. S. Doug- 
lass, of Gallatin, has been selected as Conductor, and will be 
assisted by President W. N. Billingsley, of Burritt College, and 
Profs. R. W. Jones and P. A. Lyon, of the Nashville public 
schools—all men of ability and experience as school-teachers and 
Institute Instructors. 
Tustructors have been selected because of their ability, expe- 
rience, success, and recognized efficiency in school work in all 
its departments. This is a summer school of methods for teach- 
ers, and the work will embrace all subjects required by law to be 
taught in the primary and secondary public schools of Tennes- 
see. The work will be thorough, practical, systematic, and in 
accordance with the most improved methods of teaching, school 
management, and supervision. The Institute is a business in- 
stitution for teachers, and is conducted by authority of the State 
and under the supervision of the State Superintendent. 
The Conductor, as the presiding officer, after conference with 
the other members of the faculty, will assign Instructors and 
teachers their work from day to day; determine the order of 
business, the time of meeting, the number of hours consumed 
daily ; and, upon advice of the members, will make other neces- 
sary regulations for the convenience of the teachers and the suc- 
cess of the Institute. 
The supplementary work—lectures upon school law, school 
management, the best method of conducting Institutes, ete.-— 
will be an important feature. All local arrangements will be 
made by the Citizens’ Committee. 
ROLL OF HONOR CERTIFICATES. 
The State Institutes were established, and are now main- 
tained, as summer schools for teachers. Under the law, all
-P-A-G-E-335
= 005 
teachers must be examined annually, except those holding diplo- 
mas from the Peabody College for Teachers or those receiving 
certificates from a State Institute. The course requires two 
years for comvletion. The Primary Course should be taken the 
first year ; the Secondary Course, the next year. Teachers, how- 
ever, may take the work in either the Primary Course or the 
Secondary Course at will. Any teacher may take the Primary 
Examination, but the Secondary Examination will not be al- 
lowed any teacher, except such person as may present a Primary 
Certificate from a State Institute. All teachers taking the Pri- 
mary Course who stand a satisfactory examination will be given 
a certificate freeing them from county examination for one year ; 
all teachers who successfully pass an examination upon the See- 
ondary Branches will be given a Roll of Honcr Certificate, 
which, exempts them from examination for a pcriod of four 
years. No teacher will be permitted to stand either examina- 
tion or receive either certificate unless such teacher has attended 
this Institute or another State Institute at least fifieen days. 
There will be a Secretary of the faculty, whose duty will he 
‘te keep a correct record of the daily attendance. Certificdtes 
will be signed by the State Superintendent, the Conductor, and 
the Secretary of the Institute. 
z COOKEVILLE, TENN. 
Cookeyille, Tenn., possesses one of the most delightful loca- 
tions in the State. It is 1,200 feet above sea level, which gives 
it a pleasant temperature even in the warmest months. The 
cold, freestone water and healthful surroundings make Cooke- 
ville a most pleasant resort. The people of Cookeville are very 
hospitable, social, and enterprising, always taking a lively inter- 
est in the welfare of things progressive, and have much at heart 
the success of this, the third State Institute held at that point. 
Cookeville has a magnificent college building, with all modern 
equipments. The Nashville and Knoxville Railroad and the 
Tennessee Central Railroad furnish splendid transportation fa-

Department or Pusric Insrruction, \ 
Nashville, June 30, 1902. 
To County Superintendents and Teachers: 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association will convene at 
Monteagle on July 23 and continue three days. Reasonabie 
rates have been secured at the hotels, the railroads have granted 
reduced fare, and all necessary arrangements for the accommo- 
dation of the teachers of the State have been made. The reduc- 
tions in these rates are so reasonable that the cost of attending 
this meeting will be comparatively little. 
Monteagle is a most delightful summer resort, situated upon 
the summit of the Cumberland Mountain, insuring a pleasant 
temperature at all times. Its hotel accommodations are exccl- 
lent, and a desirable auditorium for our meeting has been se- 
cured. This is a very important business meeting of educators 
of Tennessee. Matters affecting public and private schocls, 
high schools, and colleges will be discussed, and a programme 
has been arranged especially for this. occasion; so that every 
interest of popular education in the State will be represented. 
These meetings are invaluable to our school system, and the im- 
portance of attending should not be underestimated by any 
teacher in the State. The State Teachers’ Association does 
much toward shaping legislation and advancing the various in- 
terests of education. 
It is very essential that school men assemble annually, and, 
as representatives of their schools, diseuss educational matters, 
methods of teaching, and needed legislation, and codperate in all
-P-A-G-E-337
—332— 
matters of concern to the schools throughout the State. I de- 
sire to impress upon you the importance of attending this meet- 
ing of the Association and of inducing others of your county and 
locality to go with you. If the Superintendents and teachers 
in Tennessee will take that interest in our State Association 
that they should, we will demonstrate to other States that our 
system is equal to theirs, and our teachers are more active, more 
capable, and more efficient, and at the same time render material 
and permanent aid to the cause in which we are all so much 
interested. Yours very truly,

gin on this work until the report of every County Superin-

of Public Instruction at noon on September 19, 1902. It is, 
therefore, very important that your report reach this office a few 
days before the 19th, in order that it may be properly classified. 
It is my desire that the annual report be full and complete 
in every detail covering school work in Tennessee, and it can 
only be so by your making ont and forwarding at once your re- 
port. See that no error in statistics exists in your report, so 
as to obviate the necessity of returning it for correction, which, 
on account of the short time we have in which to complete the
-P-A-G-E-339
compilation, would seriously inconvenience this department. 
This is the last request you will receive on this point; and 
unless you respond promptly, the annual report will necessarily 
fail to contain any report from you. I sincerely hope you will 
not underestimate the importance of giving this matter prompt 
attention. Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
DepartTMENT oF Pusiic Instruction, 
Nashville, November 7, 1902. 
To County Superintendents and Teachers: 
I respectfully call your attention to the Act of 1887 which 
provides for the planting of trees on public school grounds in 
this State. Seetion 1 of that Act provides that— 
“Tt shall be the duty of the County Superintendent. of Pub- 
lic Schools of each county to set apart some day in November 
in each year as ‘Arbor Day’ in all the public schools of the 
county, that trees may be planted around the buildings, that 
the grounds around such buildings may be improved and bean- 
tified; such planting to be attended with appropriate and at- 
tractive ceremonies, that the day may be one of pleasure, as 
well as of instruction, for the young—all to be under the super- 
vision and direction of the teacher, who shall see that the trees 
are properly selected and set.” 
In order that trees may be planted and that uniformity may 
prevail in the observance of “Arbor Day,” I respectfully rec- 
ommend that Friday, November 28, 1902, be observed as “Ar- 
bor Day ” in Tennessee. I urge Superintendents and teachers 
to do whatever is necessary to make this day not only one of 
pleasure and recreation, but one of substantial benefit. Do 
what you can to secure the planting of many trees about your 
school buildings. Respectfully, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent.

On taking charge of the business affairs of the Association we found 
several old accounts unsettled, and we have economized as much as 
possible in order to get the Association out of debt and to put it on a 
sound financial basis. We are glad to be able to report that we have 
succeeded. The debts have all been paid, and we are ready to turn 
over to the new Executive Committee money to publish the proceed- 
ings of the present session. 
As an auditing committee, we have also examined the report and 
vouchers of the Secretary and Treasurer, and found them to be correct.

dent. 
The following report, submitted by the Committee on School 
Law, was unanimously adopted: 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SCHOOL LAW. 
‘We, your Committee on School Law, respectfully submit the follow- 
ing report: 
1. That we most earnestly urge the next General Assembly to so 
amend the Constitution as to enable the civil districts to levy an ad- 
ditional school tax to supplement the State and county tax, that we 
may have longer school terms and more efficient service. 
2. That the school law should be so amended as to make the civil 
and school districts coextensive. 
3. That the law should be so amended as to give the State Superin- 
tendent power to compel County Superintendents to make their reports 
regularly and promptly to his office. n 
4. That the County Superintendent should be clothed with the power 
to compel school directors to send their reports promptly to his office. 
J. L. BROOKS, Chairman; 
W. E. STEPHENS, 
FRANK M. SMITH, 
W. H. COOK, 
FRED. J. PAGE, 
Committee. 
The Committee on Resolutions submitted the following re- 
port, which was adopted by a rising vote: 
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS. 
Your Committee on Resolutions would respectfully submit for your 
consideration the following: 
1, The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association is duly grateful for 
favors received from officials and members of the Monteagle Sunday 
School Assembly, from the Monteagle Hotel, and from the railroads of 
the State; and the members of the Association take pleasure in making 
this public acknowledgment of all courtesies from each and every 
source. 
2. This Association respectfully recommends to all teachers of the 
State the use of literature prepared by Southern authors as the chief, 
but not the exclusive, texts in their supplementary reading, language, 
and literature work in the schoolroom. In this connection we com- 
mend the following resolution referred to this committee: “That the
-P-A-G-E-349
eae 
State Teachers’ Association heartily indorses Mr. Claude J. Bell’s ef- 
forts in the publication of classic literature by Southern authors, 
suitably arranged to meet the needs of our public schools and offered 
at a price that all can afford to pay.” 
3. We commend to all teachers the careful and systematic investi- 
gation of child study and industrial training in the public schools, as 
set forth in the excellent papers read before the present session of this 
Association. We, however, express the opinion that the best results 
will be obtained by cautious and well-considered trials, in which hasty 
conclusions and rash experiments have no place. 
4, As no illiterate people can ever be a truly great people, and as. 
knowledge is power—power to create wealth and direct enterprise, 
power to enlarge life, power to increase usefulness and happiness in 
the humblest as well as the most exalted stations of men—we 
earnestly urge upon our people the necessity and paramount duty of 
establishing and maintaining the best possible system of public schools 
in every city, town, and community of the State. We urge this as a 
civic duty that should take precedence over every other duty for the in- 
dustrial, moral, social, and political well-being of the State. 
5. We thank the members of the Executive Committee, the officers of 
the Association, and the authors of the papers presented for their care- 
ful and painstaking work, and Governor McMillin and Chancellor 
Kirkland for their practical, spirited, and cheering addresses. Finally 
we congratulate all on the harmonious proceedings and excellent re- 
sults of the thirty-seventh annual session of the Tennessee State 
Teachers’ Association. Respectfully submitted,

FIFTEENTH SESSION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL 
OFFICERS’ ASSOCIATION— 
PROCEEDINGS. 
The attendance upon the last meeting of this Association, 
which was held in Nashville from January 21 to January 238, 
was the largest in its history, including most of the prominent 
men and women connected with our public school system. The 
meeting was very harmonious, and great good will result from it. 
The Association was called to order by the President, Super- 
intendent L. S. London, of Bristol. After an invocation by 
Prof. A. J. Brandon, of Tullahoma, Governor McMillin, in an 
earnest speech, welcomed the educators to the city. Superin- 
tendent J. B. Cummings, of Trenton, responded most happily. 
State Superintendent Fitzpatrick took the chair, while Presi- 
dent London delivered one of the ablest addresses ever made by 
a President of the Association, which was referred to the fol- 
lowing committee: Capt. W. R. Garrett; Superintendents W. 
F. Albright, S. 8. Featherston, and Sam. E. Hill; Prof. S. W. 
Sherrill; and Miss Mande Moore, Superintendent of Shelby 
County.

J. Page, of Williamson. Other Superintendents reported dur- 
ing the next day. 
Exgovernor James D. Porter, now Chancellor of the Univer- 
sity of Nashville, was introduced to the Association, and re- 
sponded with a brief speech. 
A number of City Superintendents, including the following 
gentlemen, made brief reports of their work during the past 
- year: L. S. London, of Bristol; 8. W. Sherrill, of Carthage; 
F. K. Henderson, of Covington; C. P. Jester, of Humboldt; 
J. KE. Mannix, of Milan; J. W. Huey, of Springfield; and A. 
J. Brandon, of Tullahoma. 
At night a band of thirty-two pieces from the Tennessee In- 
dustrial School entertained the Association with some delight- 
ful musie in the Tulane auditorium. Although the members 
of this band are boys, ranging in age from ten or twelve to 
twenty years, it is recognized as one of the finest bands in the 
city. The entertainment will long be remembered by all who 
attended it. 
Wepnespay, JANUARY 22. 
Reports of committees constituted the first order of business, 
and Superintendent Fitzpatrick, Chairman. of the Committee 
on High Schools, presented a report for his committee., After 
reading the letter to County Courts recently issued by him, Su- 
perintendent Fitzpatrick submitted the following report: 
We heartily indorse the remarks, which fully express our views on 
this important question. The county high school law originated with 
this Association, and we should see that schools of this character are 
established. We recommend the adoption of the following resolution: 
Resolved, That a county high school, as provided for under the Act 
of 1899, is heartily approved by this Association. 'The efforts now be- 
ing made in the counties of the State to build these schools are timely, 
and this cause is entitled to the support of teachers, directors, and Su- 
perintendents of the entire State. Respectfully submitted, 
W. E. STEPHENS, 
J. R. M’DONALD, 
A. H. FULLER, 
LOUIS WILHOITE. 
After considerable discussion, the report was adopted.
-P-A-G-E-354
—349— 
Hon. Samuel G. Heiskell, of Knoxville, was introduced, and 
delivered the most eloquent address ever made before the Asso- 
ciation. He started a fire that will not be extinguished until 
Tennessee has a public school system equal to that of any other 
Southern State. 
The reports of committees were again taken up. The first 
report presented was that of the committee to whom had been 
referred the question: ‘Should County Superintendents be 
elected for four years, and should their salaries be fixed accord- 
ing to population?’ The committee recommended that sala- 
ries should be fixed according to scholastic population at not 
less than 8 cents per capita, that no salary be less than $400, 
and that terms should be four years at least. The report was 
adopted. 
REPORT ON CERTIFICATES. 
The report on certificates of promotion was presented,- rec- 
ommending, first, that pupils in the first, second, and third 
grades, upon the completion of these grades and by the recom- 
mendation of the teachers in charge, be given: promotion cards 
that will pass them to the next higher grade; secondly, that pu- 
pils completing the fourth grade, after passing a satisfactory 
examination by the teachers in charge upon questions prepared 
by the County Superintendent and having made a general aver- 
age of 75 per cent and not less than 50 per cent in any branch, 
be issued a card promoting them to the next higher grade; 
thirdly, that pupils in the fifth grade, having passed a similar 
examination as recommended in the fourth grade, be given, a 
State Primary Certificate, as provided by school law; fourthly, 
that pupils completing the sixth and seventh grades, respec- 
tively, be given cards of promotion after having passed the exam- 
ination as provided in the fourth grade; fifthly, that pupils 
completing the eighth (and last) grade, after having passed 
an examination upon questions prepared by the County Super- 
intendent and making a general average of 85 per cent and not 
less than 60 per cent in any branch, be given a State Secondary
-P-A-G-E-355
  
350— 
Certificate, provided that the papers of the applicant have been 
passed upon by the County Superintendent. The committee 
further recommended that the word “ diploma” as now used 
in. the school law be known as “ State Secondary Certificate,” 
which is prima facie evidence that the pupil has completed the 
Secondary Course as prescribed by law and is entitled to enter 
any county high school, and that when the pupil has completed 
the High School Course he shall then be given a State public 
school diploma. 
The report was adopted, after which the Committee on the Pres- 
ident’s Address presented a report, which was adopted. 
During the morning reports were made by the following Super- 
intendents: J. D. Clemmer, of Polk County; A. R. Thomas, of 
Paris and Henry County; Samuel Hixson, of Hamilton County; 
M. R. M. Burke, of McMinn County; and City Superintendents 
J. W. Abel, of MeMinnville; W. C. Lawson, of Pulaski; S. A. Myn- 
ders,.of Jackson; and 8S. M. McCallie, of Cleveland. 
The Association then adjourned. ° 
A VISIT TO THE NASHVILLE TRAINING SCHOOL. 
At 1:30 P.M. the members of the Association visited the Train- 
ing School Department of the city schools, and were very favorably 
impressed by the work done by the girls in the Cooking Department 
and by the boys in the Wood-working Department. 
The Association convened at 3 o’clock. Superintendent Fitz- 
patrick made a motion that the Tennessee Public School Officers’ 
Association recommend to the Executive Committee of the Southern 
Educational Association that the next meeting of the organization 
be held at Chattanooga. After some discussion, the motion was 
adopted. 
READING REPORTS. 
Chairman J. B. Cummings, of the committee on the question, “ Is 
it best for the common school interests of the State that the county 
public schools have a definite time for beginning each year?” 
made an earnest plea in favor of opening all county schools on 
the same date. After some earnest discussion, the committee was
-P-A-G-E-356
Opi? 
requested to reduce its report to writing. Later a report was sub- 
mitted recommending that no change in the time of opening the 
schools be suggested at this time. The report was adopted. 
SHOULD TEACHERS BE PENSIONED? 
A lengthy, but excellent, report on the above subject was read 
by Prof. William L. Lawrence, which produced a lively discussion. 
Tt was finally referred to the Committee on School Law. 
TEACH SOUTHERN LITERATURE. 
Miss Maude Moore, of Shelby County, read a report upon the 
question: “ Should Southern literature be added to our State list 
ot studies?” She said: 
We answer in the affirmative. We believe that the boys and girls 
of the South should be taught the true history of the South, and that 
this can be accomplished by making them familiar with the literature 
of the South. It is our duty to see to it that our history and literature 
are properly placed before the world, and that the children of to-day 
be taught their worth. This is a duty we owe to the “Old South,” to 
ourselves, and to the rising generation. Therefore we recommend that 
the law outlining our State course’ of study be so amended as to in- 
clude a text on Southern literature. We further recommend that this 
subject be introduced in the intermediate grades of our schools, that 
the largest number possible may be benefited thereby. 
The report was adopted. 
The committee to whom had been referred the question, “ Should 
bookkeeping, stenography, and typewriting be taught in high 
schools? ” reported adversely. They thought it would be imprac- 
ticable. j 
Prot. J. H. Bayer presented a resolution, which was adopted, 
instructing the Committee on Law to recommend to the Legisla- 
ture the passage of a law looking to the establishment of county 
industrial high schools, located upon a suitable plat of ground. 
He said they could be made almost self-sustaining, and the prac- 
tical lessons taught there would be of great value to the pupils. 
TRAINING SCHOOL REPORT. 
Superintendent Z. H. Brown, of the Nashville city schools, read 
the report of the Committee on Manual Training Schools, after
-P-A-G-E-357
—352— 
giving a brief history of the establishment of the Nashville schools. 
The report on this subject is as follows: 
It is not the purpose of the committee to enter upon an elaborate 
discussion of manual training, with a view to setting forth its value 
as an educational factor; taking it for granted that it is admitted by 
all that that education is one-sided which does not provide for training 
the eye and hand. There is, furthermore, an ever-increasing demand 
for skilled labor and artisans—a demand which the public schools of 
the State should make an effort to supply. It should be borne in mind, 
however, at the outset that making mechanics of the boys and cooks 
of the girls is not the object of manual training, but to develop every 
faculty and to better fit them to perform the functions of citizenship. 
The committee earnestly recommends the introduction of this branch 
of education in every city, but the cost is dependent upon conditions 
and the kind of equipment supplied. The most important step is to 
have a Board of Education in sympathy with the undertaking and let 
it appoint a committee, composed of its own members, whose duties it 
shall be to thoroughly investigate the cost of equipment, teachers, ma- 
terial, etc., and report back to the Board the result of its investigation. 
This will insure intelligent action. All of which is respectfully sub- 
mitted. Z. H. BROWN,

Superintendent Z. H. Brown will cheerfully give any information 
desired on this subject to those interested.

LONGER TERMS. 
A resolution was offered by Prof. C. B. Gaines and others asking 
the Legislature to pass a law providing for the maintenance of a 
tax sufficient for a five-months’ school in every district in the State 
by the State tax, the fund thus obtained to be apportioned among 
the séveral counties according to scholastic population, the County 
Courts then to supplement this by a tax sufficient to maintain a 
school of six, eight, or even ten, months. 
The resolution created a little storm of opposition, its terms 
asking for a law which would divide the whole scholastic taxation 
prorate among all the counties, when under the present system all 
school taxes are disbursed in the counties in which they are col- 
lected, with the exception of the 6 per cent interest on the imag- 
inary $2,500,000 permanent school fund, which is the only fund 
apportioned among the counties by the Comptroller. 
The resolution, after a lengthy discussion, was referred to the 
Committee on School Law. 
Prof. H. L. Higgs offered a resolution to the effect that the 
Association ask the next Legislature to increase the State tax for 
school purposes from 15 cents to 25 cents. The resolution was 
unanimously adepted. 
Capt. Thomas H. Paine, former State Superintendent of Pub- 
lic Instruction, at present Commissioner of Agriculture, addressed 
the Association, and invited the delegates to his office, that he 
might present them with copies of Dr. Gattinger’s “Flora of 
Tennessee.” 
SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
Superintendent P. L. Harned submitted the report of the Com- 
mittee on Needed School Legislation. The report said that the 
present school tax fund was insufficient, and that legislation was 
needed which would insure a five-months’ school and make possi- 
ble a ten-months’ system. County supervision was recommended, 
the present system of districts under directors being too cumber- 
some. A County Board of Directors, having charge of the entire
-P-A-G-E-359
2354 
county system, was recommended, “as were also many other minor 
changes in the present laws. 
The report was referred to the new Committee on School Law. 
Superintendent S. A. Mynders, of the committee to whom had 
been referred the question, “ How can better teachers be secured for 
the public schools?” spoke briefly. He said that the teachers 
must be prepared from a professional standpoint as well as from 
a merely literary standpoint; that teachers must have a special 
training, and must also have a natural talent for teaching others; 
that these things must be recognized by the directors and taken into 
consideration when employing teachers. He recommended those 
teachers who are trained in such schools as the Peabody College 
for Teachers; he also recommended that such teachers be given 
the additional aid of teachers’ training classes, which should be 
established in every town haying a graded school system. He said 
that under no circumstances should the need of an applicant be 
taken into consideration, as the needs of the children in the school 
far outweigh any such consideration. He deplored the tendency in 
modern. graded schools toward too much purely mechanical work 
and too close grading. 
The speech made by Superintendent Mynders was one of the best 
ever delivered before the Association. He was requested to write 
one or more articles on this very important subject for the Pro- 
gressive Teacher, and he agreed to do so. 
SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Superintendent J. V. Armstrong, of the Tennessee School for 
the Blind, presented the report of that institution, it being read 
by his secretary, Miss Skaggs. The report dealt with the work 
of this great institution, which it showed was in the very best con- 
dition. The new wing of the building, for which the last Legisla- 
ture appropriated $25,000, has been built, and the efficiency of the 
school has been greatly enhanced because of the additional facili- 
ties. 
After the reading of the report, which was very interesting and 
instructive, as giving an insight into the great work being done
-P-A-G-E-360
—355— 
for the unfortunate blind children of the State, a number of the 
pupils from the school gave a highly interesting exhibition of their 
work in manual training, including basket work, cane weaving, 
paper work, and the like. A souvenir of beautiful beadwork made 
by the girls in this school was presented to each member of the 
Association. 
A pleasing feature of the morning session was the presentation 
of a gold-headed ebony cane to State Superintendent Morgan C. 
Fitzpatrick by members of the organization, the presentation speech 
being made by S. G. Gilbreath, a former State Superintendent, but 
now of the Peabody College for Teachers. In the speech he compli- 
mented the State Superintendent’s administration, stating that 
the token was an expression of the confidence the educators held 
for the official. In accepting the cane, Superintendent Fitzpatrick 
thanked the members for the token and the speaker for his compli- 
mentary words. He thanked the school officials for their coépera- 
tion in the work during his administration. 
AFTERNOON SESSION. 
Chairman A. R. Thomas, of the committee to whom had been 
referred the question, “Is it just to the child, parents, and teach- 
ers that each county should have a different standard for examina- 
tion of teachers?” reported a recommendation that a uniform State 
examination for teachers should be established and maintained. 
This report was referred to the Committee on School Law, with 
the indorsement of the Association. 
Superintendent Fitzpatrick spoke on the subject, strongly indors- 
ing the movement, and advocated the placing of the power of exam- 
ination in a Central State Board, far removed from local prejudices 
or influences, which would give a uniform and definite examina- 
tion for all teachers. This, he argued, would prevent the evil 
which may be done by incapable or careless County Superintend- 
ents, and would work for the elevation of the profession of teachers 
in every part of the State. 
In his report upon improvement of the schools through the 
County Courts and Boards of School Directors, Chairman B. J.
-P-A-G-E-361
‘ ee 
Corban said that a County Board of Directors should be organized 
and the number of school districts should be reduced. He made 
these recommendations: Levy a sufficient tax for school pur- 
poses; get the best men on the committees on examination of can- 
didates for County Superintendents; elect energetic, capable Su- 
perintendents, with sufficient salary to demand their entire time; 
establish a county high school; employ the best-qualified teachers ; 
speak well of the teachers, especially among the pupils. The report 
was adopted. 
Superintendent J. 8. Cline, of Cumberland County, read the 
report of the committee having in hand the question: “In what 
way can the work of the County and State Institutes be made more 
effective?” The keynote of the report was: “A larger attend- 
ance at the Institutes.” The recommendations of the committee 
were along the lines of giving the greatest possible emphasis to the 
importance of the Institutes, State and County. The report was 
adopted. A 
RESOLUTIONS. 
The report of the Committee on Resolutions was read, as follows: 
It is indeed gratifying to know that the Tennessee Public School 
Officers’ Association, after fifteen years of effectivé work, during which 
time it has been instrumental in a large measure not only in securing 
much valuable legislation for the benefit of the public schools, but also 
in creating a more active performance of duty on the part of school 
officials and teachers in the State, is about to close the most successful 
meeting in its history. The large attendance, the hearty good will 
which has prevailed, and the earnest enthusiasm, all attest the keen 
interest which is to-day being consecrated upon the mission for which 
the Association was organized. The outlook is reassuring. Success is 
ours. Therefore be it 
Resolved, 1. That the persistent efforts of State Superintendent Hon. 
Morgan C. Fitzpatrick to place the educational interests of the Com- 
monwealth upon a higher and more substantial basis are hereby in- 
dorsed. 
Resolved, 2. That the work of the Executive Committee of this Asso- 
ciation, in connection with that of the State Superintendent, toward 
making this meeting not only one of success, but also one of pleasure, 
is commended, and the appreciation of this Association is hereby ac- 
knowledged. 
Resolved, 3. That the splendid addresses of Governor McMillin, Ex-
-P-A-G-E-362
—357— 
governor J: ames D. Porter, Hon. S. G. Heiskell, of Knoxville, and oth- 
ers, were a veritable inspiration to all, and served very materially in 
adding to the useful features of this meeting. 
Resolved, 4. That to the retiring officers of the Association our pro- 
found thanks be tendered for their faithful execution of duty and for 
their unswerving loyalty to the interests of the Association. 
Resolved, 5. That we further acknowledge the lasting benefits re- 
ceived from visits to the Manual Training School of the Nashville pub- 
lic schools and to the Peabody College for Teachers, and express our 
deep gratitude for the most excellent concert given by the boys of the 
Tennessee Industrial School; and we commend the management of the 
Tennessee School for the Blind, ample evidence of its efficiency having 
been shown by the exhibit before our Association, and thanks are also 
due for the souvenirs which show the handiwork of the institution. 
Resolved, 6. That the membership of this Association is under last- 
ing obligations to the hotels, to the railroad authorities, and to the citi- 
zens of Nashville generally for the many courtesies extended during our 
stay, and especially to the press for the full reports of our meetings. 
Resolved, 7. That we again affirm our allegiance to the cause of edu- 
cation and proclaim to all that the fight is on until the grand old 
“Volunteer State” is freed from the baneful influences of ignorance 
and our boys-and girls have educational advantages equal to those of 
any other State in the Union. Respectfully submitted, 
FRED. J. PAGE, Chairman; 
SAM. E. HILL, 
SUSIE A. MILLER, 
W. E. STEPHENS, 
HOMER L. HIGGS, ‘ 
Committee. 
Prof. J. lu. Brooks, of Jackson, moved that the Association in- 
dorse the action of the Peabody College for Teachers and the 
University of Nashville in the selection of Hon. James D. Porter 
as President of the college and as Chancellor of the university. 
The motion prevailed by a unanimous vote. 
Prof. S. A. Mynders introduced a resolution asking Hon. S. G. 
Heiskell to become a candidate for the Legislature and come to the 
General Assembly and work for the much-needed school legislation. 
The resolution was adopted. 
Prof. A. P. Bourland presented the report of the Peabody College 
for Teachers. It was a very able and exhaustive paper, giving a 
clear idea of the conditions and the needs of the Peabody College. 
The Committee on the St. Louis Louisiana Purchase Centen-
-P-A-G-E-363
—358— 
nial Exposition reported resolutions recommending that the Asso- 
ciation use its efforts to secure a proper Tennessee exhibit at the 
Exposition. Under these resolutions, which were adopted, the fol- 
lowing committee was appointed to take the matter in charge: 
Superintendent M. C. Fitzpatrick, Dr. C. W. Dabney, Prof. S. G. 
Gilbreath, Dr. George Summey, Dr. James H. Kirkland, J. E. 
Mannix, A. J. Brandon, Miss Maude Moore, and Samuel Hixon. 
Superintendent Kilvington, of the Tennessee Industrial School, 
made a report of the work of that institution which was very en- 
couraging, and it was indorsed by the Association. 
Capt. W. R. Garrett submitted the report of the Watkins Insti- 
tute, speaking interestingly of the work of the night school. 
The following officers were elected for the next year: 
President—Robert Lee Bynum, of Jackson. 
Vice President—A. J. Brandon, of Tullahoma. 
Chairman of the Executive Committee—Claude J. Bell, of Nash-

IN MEMORIAM. 
PROF. L. S, LONDON. 
Prof. L. S. London was born in Catoosa County, Ga., on 
July 8, 1867, and died in Clarksville, Tenn., on September 1, 
1902. When Professor London was seven years of age, his fa- 
ther moved, with his family, to Bradley County, Tenn., where 
he has since resided. Professor London was educated in the pub- 
lie schools of this State and in the Peabody College for Teach- 
ers, at Nashville, where he graduated with honor, having made 
a record as a student unsurpassed by any member of his class. 
After his graduation, he taught for three years in the public 
schools of Knoxville, a part of which time he was principal of 
the West Knoxville Public School. He was elected Superin- 
tendent of the public schools of Tullahoma, which position he 
filled for one year, and then returned to his old place in Knox- 
ville. In 1896 he was elected Superintendent of the city 
schools of Bristol, which position he filled with eminent ability 
until 1902, when he was elected Superintendent of the Clarks- 
ville public schools. He had just entered upon the discharge 
of his duties at Clarksville, when he suddenly died from an 
attack of appendicitis. 
In 1899 Professor London was appointed a member of the 
State Board of Education, and in 1900 was elected President 
of the Public School Officers’ Association. He was one of the 
best-known, most capable, most popular educators in Tennessee, 
and his untimely death is universally regretted. In every walk 
of life and under all circumstances he came up to the highest 
standard required of a teacher and filled in every respect the 
requirements necessary to make a full man. He was an ex- 
emplary member of the Baptist Church, and a Mason (Knight 
Templar). 
In 1893 Professor London married Miss Sadie King, who, with 
two small children, survives him. His life, his work, and his 
high character (personal and official) are a rich heritage which 
he bequeaths to them.

INTRODUCTION 
TO REVISED EDITION 
PURPOSE AND PLAN 
Since this book has had so cordial a welcome through- 
out the field in which it has been used, going into many 
editions, the author has revised and enlarged the volume 
to make it available for a wider field of usefulness. An 
incessant and urgent demand for a book providing 
wholesome recreation for young people is fully met in 
this new edition. The enhancement of fellowship by 
means of play, intellectual activities, social interest, is 
truly a worthy objective. In preparing the matter for 
the following pages the author has met the needs of many 
thousands of young people’s organizations. This has been 
possible due to the fact that he is a successful practical 
worker who has specialized in his subject and knows 
what is valuable and available for his purpose. The 
arrangement of the plans given will be found one of the 
convenient features of the book. By chapters entertain- 
ments of different kinds are grouped, and a chapter of 
ealendar events will enable a committee to find at once 
and provide for each anniversary as the weeks and the 
months tell their tale of the year. <A bibliography makes 
material for further study easily found and indicates 
sources.

  HOW TO CONDUCT 
A SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL 
Tue first step toward conducting successful socials is to 
realize the importance of having them. 
Young people will seek to satisfy the social instinct. It 
is God-implanted. ‘‘Nothing lives to itself. The insects 
move in swarms, the birds of the air in flocks, and the beasts 
of the field fraternize.’’ If the Church and the community 
do not provide their social life in other wholesome modes 
of expression, this God-implanted instinct, young people 
will seek outside the Church for places, many of them 
undesirable, or positively dangerous. 
It is the business of responsible organizations to provide 
for and direct the social life of its young people. The 
Church begins to lose its grip on its young people when it 
fails to appeal to the full-rounded life. Religion is for the 
whole life. Christ is interested in my play as well as my 
work, 
After a vision of the need, there are four essentials for * 
the conducting of a successful social. 
The first is work. ‘‘Success,’’ says some one, ‘‘is like a 
nugget. You’ve got to dig for it. The richest gold mine 
doesn’t waft the nuggets to you on the balmy breezes.’’ 
If you want to put on a successful program of social activi- 
ties, you’ve got to dig. It means plan, plan, plan, and 
vu 
   
-P-A-G-E-8

viii HOW TO CONDUCT A SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL 
work, work, work. No easiest-way method succeeds. No 
“‘programmy’’ socials go. No sameness goes. You keep 
them guessing as to what is coming. If you do this, you 
are bound to work. 
The second essential is organization. A Social Committee 
chairman can’t do the job nearly so well alone. One who 
doesn’t work the whole committee to the limit is making 
a big mistake. This committee ought to get together to 
| discuss the plans for each social. Definite responsibility 
| for certain features of the social should then be delegated 
to different members of the committee. Refreshment, In- 
troduction, Decoration, and other committees should be ap- 
pointed for each social. Work out all these details in your 
committee meeting. 
The third essential is the research habit, coupled with 
resourcefulness. To be successful, to keep your young 
people on the qui vive, to make the next social an occasion 
to which they look forward with keen interest, you’ve got 
to collect ideas from every source available. Magazines like 
the Ladies’ Home Journal, the Woman’s Home Companion, 
and others; religious periodicals like the Epworth Era; 
books on socials—all these must be made to pay tribute to 
your program of social activities. Every Social Committee 
ought to catch clipitis and then fill a scrapbook full of 
plans for socials, games, stunts, ete., arranging them all in 
systematic order. 
However, no matter how good the ideas you gather in 
this manner may be, you have to adapt them to your 
particular group and conditions. There’s where you need 
resourcefulness, and again there’s where your committee 
becomes a necessity. 
The fourth essential is kick. Kick is synonymous with 
pep, punch, enthusiasm, or whatever you choose to call it. 
It indicates that there is no drag. So thoroughly have 
things been planned that without hitch or hindrance, with. 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
  HOW TO CONDUCT A SUCCESSFUL SOCIAL ix 
out any of those awkward pauses that feature some socials, 
everything moves along smoothly; everything fits into 
everything else, and everybody enters into the whole pro- 
gram with zest; no one is bored, no one is stiff, no one 
is neglected. 
Work, organization, research, kick—all spell work. You 
can’t get away from it. There is absolutely no chance to 
get by without it. It’s the one big item.

_ A Calendar Social. 
  
SEASON SOCIAL 
A season social would go well in January. Divide the 
company into four groups, Winter, Summer, Autumn, and 
Spring, according to the month of birth of each one. Thus 
December, January, and February would form the winter 
group, and so on. 
Decorate booths or rooms appropriately as headquarters 
for the various groups. For instance, Winter could deco- 
rate in white or could use the red and green color scheme, 
with holly and cedar to help the appearance. Summer 
could use potted plants to advantage. Hanging birds or 
butterflies would also add to its ‘‘summery’’ appearance. 
Autumn could decorate with autumn leaves, real or imita- 
tion, or it might use the Halloween idea, with jack-o’- 
lanterns, witches, black cats, and yellow and black crépe 
paper. Spring could achieve a Maypole table, using pink 
and white erépe paper streamers with small dolls at the

outer edges of the table holding the streamers, or artificial 
daisies could be used in profusion. 
Let the groups now engage in contests of various sorts. 
Have each prepare some stunt or give a yell or sing a song. 
The following contests can be used: The Standing Broad 
Smile, the Baby Marathon, the Banana Feed, and the 
Cracker Relay, all of which appear elsewhere in this book. 
This social can be adapted to any time of the year if 
desired. 
DrcoraTIONS AND REFRESHMENTS 
Decorations 
Summer.—F lags and national colors. 
Winter—White color scheme. Sprinkle with diamond 
dust. Use a sleigh as a centerpiece. Touch off the white 
with a bit of holly and red. 
Spring.—Green and white, with plenty of natural or 
artificial flowers. 
Autumn.—Brown and red, with autumn leaves and chrys- 
anthemums. 
Refreshments 
Summer.—Lemonade and cakes tied with red, white, and 
blue ribbons. 
Winter.—Ice cream and frosted cake. 
Spring.—Lettuce sandwiches and olives. 
Autumn.—F ruit. 
AnorHer Szsason Socran 
Decorations 
Spring.—Green and pink crépe paper. Potted plants. 
Spring may be spelled with green and pink paper flowers 
on some sort of cloth for background.
-P-A-G-E-13
  PHUNOLOGY 3 
Summer.—Lots of greenery. Japanese lanterns. Flowers. 
Autumn.—Autumn leaves and Halloween decorations. 
Winter—Color scheme—white. Use plenty of cotton 
batting. Sprinkle with diamond dust. One group spelled 
winter in large cotton letters using heavy string to form 
the background or frame for the letters. 
Puan 
The crowd is divided into four groups according to the 
season in which they happen to be born. Hach of these 
appoints a leader and practices yells and songs. Hach 
group is responsible for managing one of the events as 
described in this article. Judges should be appointed to 
determine winners in the various contests. The score- 
keeper should post the scores on the blackboard as they 
are made. 
Events 
1. Yelling Contest—If desired judges may require the 
four groups to give yells or sing a song and award points 
for first, second, and third places. 
2. Snowball Contest.—This contest is conducted by Win- 
ter at its booth. A hoop one foot or so in diameter which 
has been covered with white and three contestants from 
each group (preferably girls) line up about ten feet from 
the hoop. They are provided with three snowballs of loose 
cotton batting. Each contestant gets three throws. The 
ball going through the hoop scores one point for the team 
and the team with the highest score is awarded first place. 
This contest is entirely managed by the Winter group. 
3. Spring Fever Race.—About ten contestants for each 
team, more or less is desired. <A pillow is given each team. 
At a signal to start the first person on the team pulls the 
pillow out of its casing and then puts it back in. After 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
ee 
4 PHUNOLOGY 
doing this he passes it on to the next team mate who goes 
through the same performance. This is continued on down 
the line until the last player on the team has gone through 
the necessary performance and rushes to the head of the 
line holding the encased pillow aloft and calling out the 
name of his side. Spring, of course, is responsible for 
managing this new event. It should be seen that all pil- 
lows and casings are the same size so no one team will 
have an advantage. 
4. (a) Honeymoon Race.—Boy and girl to represent each 
| group. Each couple is provided with a suitcase in which 
| is wearing apparel of all sorts. A hat, kimono, pair of 
men’s shoes for the girl and a hat, raincoat for the boy. 
Each couple is also provided with an umbrella. All suit- 
cases are shut and strapped. At a signal to go couples 
arm in arm rush to one end of the room open suitcases and 
don wearing apparel. The boy then opens the umbrella, 
closes the suitcase with the girl’s own shoes inside and 
arm in arm they rush back to the starting point. Here 
they must take off wearing apparel, put it back in suitcase. 
The girl must put on her own shoes; the umbrella must 
be shut. The first couple to finish, of course, wins. 
(b) Fanning Bee—One contestant from each group. 
Each contestant is given a palm leaf fan and a toy balloon. 
At a signal to start contestant must bat the toy balloon up 
in the air and then keep it in the air until they have 
reached the goal at the other end of the room. If it is 
allowed to hit the ground the contestant must pick it up 
with the fan. He is not allowed to roll it along the floor. 
Both of these contests are managed by the Summer 
group. 
5. Football Tournament.—Two tables about four feet in 
length should be provided. These tables should be covered 
with green or brown wrapping paper which should be 
drawn tightly over the surface. This wrapping paper then
-P-A-G-E-15
  PHUNOLOGY 5 
should be marked off with chalk to represent a football 
field. Goal posts should be set up at both ends of the field. 
These goal posts could be easily made by setting up stand- 
ards about six inches high in half spools. A cross-bar 
should be tacked to these standards. The distance between 
these posts should be about eight inches. Eleven players 
from each team line up at either end of the field. One 
at a time they blow the football attempting to send it 
through the opponent’s goal. The ball is of course placed 
in the center of the field after each attempt. The football 
is an egg that has been emptied of its contents by punching 
a small hole in either end of the egg and blowing out the 
contents. This can be drepped in a coffee pot and browned 
or it.can be painted with water colors. With pen and ink 
make the lacing and seams so as to make it look like a 
football. Several extra footballs had better be on hand 
for emergency. If the football goes through the opponent’s 
goal post it counts a touch-down and six points. If it goes 
the goal line but not through the goal post it counts two 
points. The last quarter of the game may be played by 
having both teams have all their players blow at once. In 
this case the goal posts are removed and the touch-down 
is scored when the ball goes over or touches the goal line. 
In this quarter the referee places the ball in the center of 
the field. The player starts blowing when he sounds his 
whistle. If the ball goes outside it is brought back into 
the field at the point at which it went outside, just as it 
would be in a regular football game. No player is allowed 
to put his face over in the field. If he does his side is 
penalized for off side play. 
Winter can play Summer and Spring can play Fall at 
the same time. 
The winners would then play a final game to determing 
the football champion. 
This contest is managed by the Autumn group.
-P-A-G-E-16
6 PHUNOLOGY 
In the scoring five points should be allowed for first place, 
three points for second, and one point for‘third. The 
score should be recorded on a blackboard so everybody 
can see the standing of the groups. 
  
A NEW YEAR’S JAMBOREE 
Your invitation might read as follows: 
JamporEE! Our! Our! 
In what month were you born! 
You needn’t confess, 
But wear something that tells 
So that we may guess. 
To make yourself at home 
We want you to feel free 
Next Thursday night at eight 
At our New Year’s Jamboree. 
(Name of organization, place and date) 
Urge every one to come wearing something representative 
of the month of his birth. You might require those who 
disregard your request to pay a fine. 
January could wear a very small naked doll labeled 
**1920,’’ or could come dressed as a snow man or snow girl. 
February could wear a white dress covered with red 
paper hearts or wear a cherry or small toy hatchet on the 
lapel of the coat, or a miniature picture of Washington 
would do. 
March might wear a shamrock, a bit of green ribbon, 
or a toy clay pipe. <A pair of bellows might be carried 
and used frequently to remind folks that in March the 
winds do blow. 
April could be arrayed in raincoat and carry an um- 
brella. A dunce cap or jester’s cap and bells might be

  PHUNOLOGY 7 
used. A piece of foolscap paper worn on the dress might 
keep them guessing. 
May could wear a rose tied to a small American flag, 
indicating Decoration Day, or a crown on the head and 
chains of flowers hung about the neck would indicate that 
the ‘‘May Queen’’ was in attendance. 
June could come as a bride or in cap and gown as a 
sweet girl graduate. A rose worn in the lapel of the coat 
or in the hair or a corsage bouquet of roses would indicate 
the month of roses. 
July might shine forth in patriotic colors. A Columbia 
costume would be fitting. An American flag could be worn. 
Some clever boy might make up as an animate firecracker. 
A large cylindrical hatbox, or two of them put together, 
covered with red paper, a piece of rope glued to the top 
for a fuse, eyeholes cut out so that the ‘‘firecracker’’ might 
see where to walk, the whole thing slipped over the head 
and shoulders of the boy, and the thing is done. 
August could come as a girl or boy in summer attire 
carrying a tennis racket. Or some one might think of it 
as the month of Tennyson’s birth and come with a copy 
of ‘‘Sweet and Low”’ or ‘‘In Memoriam’’ pinned on him. 
King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table might 
also think of coming to the party. 
September could come arrayed in overalls or wear a toy 
spade, indicative of Labor Day. Schoolbooks would indi- 
eate it as the month school begins. 
October could wear some Halloween novelty—witch, 
pumpkin head, black cat, ete. A dress covered with autumn 
leaves (these could be made out of paper if the real leaves 
are not available) would do very well. ‘‘The one-hundred- 
per-cent American’’ pinned on the lapel of the coat might 
remind some one that this is the month of Theodore 
Roosevelt’s birth. 
November would be easy. A picture of a turkey, a
-P-A-G-E-18

8 PHUNOLOGY 
miniature football worn on the dress or coat, a Camp Fire 
girl carrying a basket or fruit, a football player—any of 
these would do. 
December could wear a sprig of holly or a picture of 
Santa Claus. Some one might come dressed as Santa. A 
clever costume of red and green with trimmings of holly 
might be conceived. 
These and many more ingenious ways to represent the 
month of their birth will be thought of by the young 
people. 
The first thing on the program would be the guessing 
‘ of the birth month of each one present. The names and 
months should be written on a sheet of paper by each 
guest. A souvenir calendar is given to the person giving 
the most correct answers. 
Now the crowd indulges in stunts for each month of the 
year. 
SNnowBaLL Barrie 
For January a snowball battle could be staged. The 
crowd would be divided into two sides. <A ball of cotton 
batting is given to the leader of each side. The idea is 
to throw this ball through a suspended holly wreath. Each 
player in turn has one try, a point being scored when the 
*‘snowball’’ goes through the wreath. Captains should line 
up their players and see that there is no delay in having 
the players take their turns. 
Heart Hunt 
February announces a hunt for paper hearts, awarding 
some prize for the one who finds the most. 
Granp Marcu 
March will start a grand march about the room in which 
everybody takes part, the leader winding in and out, trot- 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  PHUNOLOGY 9 
ting or walking as the mood may strike him, finishing by 
winding the party about in a spiral march, reversing his 
direction when he reaches the center and unwinding the 
spiral as the grand climax. 
Peanut Hunt 
April announces a peanut hunt; and after the crowd has 
scrambled about awhile in vain search, the leader informs 
them it is an ‘‘ April fool.’’ 
Sprine Sone 
Some one could play Mendelssohn’s ‘‘Spring Song’’ as a 
piano solo for May, or some rollicking ring game, such as 
‘‘Farmers in the Dell,’’ could be played for a few minutes. 
Dress THE BRIDE 
For June provide each one with a clothespin, some white 
erépe paper and string, and ask them to dress the bride. 
Allow five minutes for this. 
““FYRECRACKERS’’ 
For July pass out ‘‘firecrackers’’? which are sticks of 
candy wrapped in red tissue paper with a string fuse at 
the top. 
‘‘JOoGRAPHY’’ 
September might divide the guests into four groups ac- 
cording to the seasons. Then conduct a rapid-fire geogra- 
phy quiz after this manner: The leader calls for the name 
of either a city, river, or mountain, and then announces 
the letter with which it must begin. For instance, the 
leader shouts ‘‘City—B.’’ The Autumn group, perhaps, 
shouts ‘‘Boston’’ just before Spring gets out ‘‘Baltimore.’’
-P-A-G-E-20
  10 PHUNOLOGY 
Seore one for Autumn. Ten calls will be enough. The 
group with the highest number of points could then be 
announced as winner. 
FortUuNES 
Have fortunes written on slips of paper. Place these in 
two boxes, one for boys and one for girls. Let each one 
draw a fortune. 
“(A YEuL-’M-UP’’ 
For November ask each of the groups for September to 
get up an appropriate yell. Or the game of table foot- 
ball might be played, with representatives of the groups as 
contestants. This game is described in Chapter XI. 
‘*Hats’’? AND SANTA 
For August let the refreshments be served picnic fashion, 
Santa Claus representing December superintending the dis- 
tribution of the ‘‘eats.’’ 
“Pep”? Hint 
The person in charge of the program should see that 
everything is run off in rapid order. Have no delays or 
hitches. Wise planning will be required. To borrow a 
camp expression, you must ‘‘make it snappy.’’ 
  
A CALENDAR SOCIAL 
Invitations might be written on « card, with a page 
from a small calendar pad pasted in one corner. 
Srunts 
As persons arrive have each write on a slip of paper his 
name and the month of his birth. No one is to see what 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
PHUNOLOGY 11 
  is written except the committee in charge. This committee 
assorts the slips by months and then calls out names of 
persons in each group, asking them to get together and 
prepare a stunt representative of their month. Allow from 
fifteen minutes to a half hour for this. The rest of the 
crowd guesses the name of the month and shouts it out as 
soon as some one guesses correctly. 
January could stage a snowball fight with handkerchiefs 
or have a scene in which the old year departs and the new 
year enters. 
February could celebrate a few birthdays—Washington, 
Lincoln, or Longfellow, for instance. A burlesque on the 
cutting down of the cherry tree might be worked out. A 
clever mock trial could be arranged in which Dan Cupid 
is arraigned for having wrought havoc in the local society. 
March folks could storm or march about. All of them 
could talk at once and incessantly. Surely somebody would 
guess that people so ‘‘windy’’ must represent March. 
April could have a cornet solo which continues after 
the cornet has been taken from the lips of the player, a 
concealed victrola furnishing the music. A violin solo may 
also be played in the same manner. 
May could put on a Maypole dance. 
June could have a wedding. 
July could celebrate the Fourth or could reproduce some 
patriotic scene. 
August might have a picnic, playing some rousing games 
and sitting about on the floor and eating an imaginary 
picnic dinner. 
September could have opening day at school. 
October could pull off some Halloween pranks. It could 
make some local hits by having a fortune teller answer 
imaginary questions for some of those present. A ghost 
story might be told. 
November might stage an imaginary football game, lining
-P-A-G-E-22
12 PHUNOLOGY 
up, calling signals, and pretending to run with the ball. 
Or the Novemberites could do a lot of ‘‘Rah-rah-ing,’’ 
having a yell leader to direct them. Or they might have a 
mimic Thanksgiving feast, after which they might feign 
Thanksgiving stomach aches. 
December could be represented by the singing of ‘‘Silent 
Night, Holy Night’’ or other Christmas songs. Or it might 
be represented by children that are painfully good. 
  Goop RESOLUTIONS 
Now each person is given paper and pencil and asked to 
write ‘‘Resolved’’ at the top. Underneath this each is to 
write six New-Year resolutions, serious or otherwise. If 
the crowd is large, three resolutions will be plenty. These 
are collected, and some one reads them. ‘The rest try to 
guess the authorship of each set of resolutions. 
Next the guests are asked to write a New-Year resolution 
for some one else in the crowd. As each of these is read, 
guesses are made as to the person for whom the resolution 
was written. 
CaLENDAR BASKET BALL 
Now suspend twelve baskets, each with the name of a 
month on it. Provide twelve rubber balls, each with the 
name of a month printed on it in black. The trick is to 
see who can place the greatest number of balls in the right 
baskets. The score does not count if the ball does not go 
into the basket of the same name. Each person is allowed 
two throws with each ball. The baskets may be put on 
the floor in a row and the players be required to toss from 
a line several feet away from the first basket, much after 
the fashion of the old game of ‘‘Soakey.’’ Award a 
calendar as a prize to the most proficient player.
-P-A-G-E-23
  PHUNOLOGY 13 
CaLENDAR Race 
If another game is needed, you might try a calendar 
race. Have the crowd divided and lined up on two sides. 
Give the leader of each line a set of twelve cards on which 
are written the names of the months. These cards are 
mixed up before being given to the leaders. At the signal 
to go these leaders start the cards down their respective 
lines one at a time. The end player as he receives the 
cards puts them on the floor at his feet. When he has 
received all twelve cards and arranged them in proper 
order—January, February, March, ete——he proceeds to 
pick them up and start them back down the line. The 
first side whose leader receives all twelve cards and ar- 
ranges them properly on the floor wins the race. 
On the plate with the refreshments have a date to which 
is fastened with a toothpick a card or piece of paper bear- 
ing this query: ‘‘Will you make a date to meet with the 
Epworth League Sunday evening at 6:30?’ 
  
A TWELFTH-NIGHT CAKE PARTY 
The 6th of January is Twelfth-night, or Old Christmas. 
In the olden days the Yuletide festivities continued for a 
period of twelve days, which was the time supposed to be 
consumed by the three wise men in their journey to Bethle- 
hem. Thus the season of gayety culminated on the evening 
of January 6, or Twelfth-night. In England and on the 
Continent it used to be the occasion for elaborate social 
functions. A ring was concealed in an immense cake, and 
the guest obtaining it was made ‘‘king’’ or ‘‘queen.’’ 
Every vestige of Christmas green was supposed to be taken 
down and burned. This was a peace offering to evil spirits 
and insured good luck to the household.

Cakes are to Twelfth-night what the tree is to Christmas. 
In London, so one writer tells us, on the night before this 
festival there are always crowds before the bakery shop 
windows to see the wonderful display of cakes of all sorts 
and sizes, some of them ornamented in all sorts of in- 
genious ways. With this in mind, a cake party is decidedly 
apropos. 
Ask each girl to come in costume representing a cake, 
cooky, or doughnut, and each boy to come attired as a 
baker. 
Each cake may come accompanied by a baker, or some 
sort of mixing game may be used after the crowd as- 
sembles, and thus each girl will get a baker for a partner. 
There are all sorts of possibilities in costume creations. 
A dress trimmed with a fringe of tiny sponges would 
represented sponge cake. 
A dress of alternate brown and white ruffles and a 
chocolate drop cap, chocolate cake. 
A white dress adorned with little red devils and a little 
devil figure in the hair will represent devil cake. 
Cup cake could be represented by some one wearing a 
fringe of tin cups. 
Bride’s cake, by a bridal costume. 
Marble cake, by one dressed in a gown with layers of 
white, pink, and brown. 
Angel food, by white costume with wings. 
Pictures of hens sewed on the dress could represent layer 
cake. 
Martha Washington cake, by some one in colonial cos- 
tume. 
Oatmeal cake, by some one with Quaker oats signs sewed 
over the dress. 
Ribbon cake, a white dress with spangles of ribbon.

LA LEAP YEAR PARTY 
Every four years comes leap year, when February lays 
claim to twenty-nine days and the young ladies are 
privileged to ‘‘pop the question.’’ A merry party could be 
arranged combining the leap year with your Valentine 
party. 
Your invitation, with place and date, might feature this 
bit of rhyme: 
“‘One year in four 
We girls adore,

-P-A-G-E-28
18 PHUNOLOGY 
For this is leap year time. 
So watch your step; 
They’ll get you yet 
As some one’s valentine. 
Now get the date 
And don’t be late. 
‘We want you to help us celebrate.’’ 
In a crowd where all are well acquainted it would be lots 
of fun to have the girls go for the boys and escort them to 
the party. 
The girls should take the initiative in every way, helping 
the men off with their coats, seeing that they are com- 
fortably seated, holding doors open for them, and paying 
them all the little courtesies usually shown to ladies by 
well-bred gentlemen. 
“.  Puine Huarrsrrines 
Suspend from the chandelier or in the doorway two large 
hearts made of red paper and hung several inches apart. 
Make a hole in each, through which are run red strings of 
considerable length, the ends hanging down on either side. 
The men take hold of the strings on one side and the girls 
on the other, everybody being careful not to draw the 
strings taut. At the signal all pull their strings, the hearts 
are riven, and partners are found holding the ends of the 
same string. This gives the couples for the next game. 
PROGRESSIVE CONFAB 
Each person has been provided with ten small hearts cut 
out of red paper. They sit in a circle about the room in 
couples and are given a subject on which to converse for 
two minutes. The use of any personal pronoun in the con- 
versation is barred. The person disobeying this rule must 
surrender one of the paper hearts to the person with whom  
-P-A-G-E-29
  PHUNOLOGY 19 
he or she is conversing for each infraction. At the end 
of the two minutes each girl rises and moves to the next 
man, the men remaining seated. A new topic is given out, 
and this is continued until a certain number of subjects 
have been discussed. Some subjects that may be used are: 
‘*Childhood Days,’’ ‘‘School Days,’’ ‘‘First Sweethearts,’’ 
“‘Friendship,’’ ‘‘Love,’’ ‘‘Marriage,’’ ‘‘Old Age,’’ ete. 
+ Wink 
Keeping the partners with whom they find themselves at 
the close of the Progressive Confab, the company can now 
indulge in the old game of ‘‘Wink,’’ with the girls doing 
the winking. Hach girl will step behind the chair of her 
partner. -An odd player will have to be used to stand 
behind an empty chair. She winks at one of the men, and 
he must endeavor to elude his guard and go to the winker’s 
chair. The girl guarding may not step from behind her 
chair, but most endeavor to hold him in the chair. The 
girl losing her partner becomes winker, and the game con- 
tinues. 
PROGRESSIVE PROPOSALS 
The men are provided with a number of small hands and 
mittens cut out of paper. It would help add to the merri- 
ment of the occasion if the men were provided also with 
fans behind which to hide their blushes. The girl does 
the proposing. When she is accepted, she is given a hand. 
If she is rejected, she ‘‘gets the mitten.’’ At the tap of a 
bell each girl moves to the next man to try her luck once 
more. So it continues until each girl has made the rounds 
or, in case there is too large a crowd for this, until a certain 
time has elapsed. The girl who has collected the greatest 
number of hands in this time could be awarded some suit- 
able prize. A consolation prize might also be given to the 
one with the greatest number of mittens.

Two More Stunts 
If other games are desired, why not give out to each 
man a little bit of tissue paper, a needle, some thread, and 
a peanut and have him dress up the peanut as a doll? 
Let each girl write a proposal of marriage to some real 
or fictitious character. These are collected by the leader 
and read, some award being made for the most clever 
proposal. 
REFRESHMENTS 
Each girl has been instructed to bring an apron, and 
now the boys don these aprons and serve the refreshments 
without help from the girls, who wait to be served. A 
plentiful supply of heart-shaped cookies has been made by 
the girls during the week, and these and ‘‘Love Potion’’ 
are served. ‘‘Love Potion’’ is our old friend lemonade, 
with a few oranges, some grated pineapple, and a bit of 
grape juice added. This makes a delightful drink. 
ADDITIONAL SUBJECTS FOR ProGRESSIVE ConFAB 
Which does a man love best, his mother, his wife, or his 
sweetheart? 
Which is the best way to a man’s heart, through his eyes 
or his ears? 
Whose love is truest, a man’s or a woman’s? 
What are women’s rights? 
What is your ideal man or woman?

King and Queen of Hearts 
Select a girl and a boy to act as King and Queen of 
Hearts. Have gilt paper crowns decorated, with red paper 
hearts for each. Improvise a throne and decorate it appro- 
priately. The queen and the king sit side by side. Subjects 
approach the throne one at a time, first a girl, then a boy, 
and so on. Each girl goes to the king and kneels before him. 
He whispers instructions in her ears, handing her a large 
red cardboard heart. Each boy kneels before the queen. 
Every one must do as bidden. For instance, the queen 
hands the heart to a boy, who starts the game by kneeling 
before her, and whispers: ‘‘Give this heart to the prettiest 
girl in the room.’’ The boy makes his decision after more 
or less deliberation, hands the heart to some girl without a 
word of explanation, and takes his seat. The girl now 
reports to the king, kneels, and hands back the heart. He 
returns it with instructions perhaps to give it to the boy 
who is ‘‘the best entertainer.’’ Each must remember to 
whom he or she gave the heart and why, but is to tell no 
one until commanded to do so by the king and queen. At 
the close, when each one in the circle has had the heart at 
least once, the king instructs all the players to tell to whom 
they gave the heart and for what reason, beginning with the 
first player to report to the throne and then in order to 
the last person. It may have been for ‘‘the biggest feet’’ 
or ‘‘biggest ears’’ or ‘‘most beautiful eyes’’ or ‘‘the one 
who would make the most ideal wife,’’ ete. 
Heart Toss 
Make two sets of heart-shaped rings of heavy wire, three 
to each set. Cover with ribbon or crépe paper. Wind one 
stake with gilt paper to represent Wealth, hearts ringing 
it counting five points. The second stake may be longer

than the rest and have a laurel wreath at its base. Ring- 
ing it counts ten. It represents Fame. Wind the third 
stake, which might be shaped like an arrow, with pink 
and have a circle of paper hearts above its base. This is 
Love, and ringing it counts twenty-five points. Hach player 
gets a try with the tree rings, and the first one to make 
500 may be declared winner. Or you could choose sides 
and have the side totaling the highest number of points in 
one time around declared victor. In this case each side 
would be provided with a set of rings.

Lirtie Mary’s Essay on HusBanps 
Husbands is the people that your Mammas marry, and 
she always wishes she hadn’t picked out the one she did, 
but I don’t know why, ’cause Husbands all look alike to 
me. 
My Mamma says that husbands are like the things you 
buy on the Bargain Counters. They look just fine and 
grand, and you think you’ll die if you don’t get the one 
you got your eyes set on, and you fight other women for it, 
and after you get it and take it home with you and keep it 
awhile it looks like 30 cents, and you spend your life 
wondering what made you fool enough to want it. 
There used to be a lot of husbands, and it was as easy 
to go out and get one as it was to shoot a buffalo for 
breakfast, but every year they got fewer and fewer; and 
they don’t roam the Plains any more, and soon there won’t 
be any husbands or buffaloes left ’cept those in captivity. 
My Mamma says that there’s no other wild animal in 
the world as hard to tame as a husband, and then, even 
after you’ve had hobbles on one for four or five years, it’s 
liable to break loose and jump over the fence.

Husbands is very nice and polite to strange ladies, and 
they laugh themselves most to death when pretty slim 
young ladies tells funny stories; but when their wives are 
forty years old and have gotten fat, husbands is grouchy, 
and when their wives tells funny stories all they say is 
“‘Humph!”’ 
Husbands is strange creatures, but all the Young Ladies 
is trying to catch one, and all the Old Ladies that’s got 
double chins that shake when they talk is a-trying to keep 
the ones they’ve got. 
There are two kinds of husbands, good husbands and 
bad husbands. Good husbands is one that gives his wife 
lots of money to spend and goes down town at 8 o’clock 
and don’t come home till 6 o’clock. And a husband that’s 
a mean old thing is one that makes his wife buy things on 
a bill so he can see how she spends the money, and goes 
snooping around the kitchen to see how thick the cook 
pares the potato peelings, and stays at home all day. 
A husband is a right useful animal to have around the 
house, ’cause it pays the bills.

straight, curved, saw-toothed, through the middle, off a 
eorner, etc. Be sure to keep them in two piles, so they 
will match up properly. Have girls and boys match for 
partners. 
Heart Hunt 
Now let the partners engage in a heart hunt. Have tiny 
red hearts, and a few gold ones perhaps, hidden about the 
room. Let the players hunt to some rollicking tune played 
on the piano. The pianist will stop playing for short 
intervals every now and then, and the hunters must retain 
whatever position they may be in when the music ceases 
until its starts again. If any gold hearts are uged, they may 
count five points, the red ones counting one. The couple 
with the highest number of points at the close of the hunt 
may be given some sort of prize, such as a small heart- 
shaped box filled with candy. 
Heart-aND-Dart GAME 
Make a large red heart out of cardboard. Paste on it 
eight or ten small white paper hearts. Number these. 
Write on the blackboard or post in a conspicuous place the 
meaning of each heart. For instance, No. 1 may mean 
“‘matrimonial success,’’ No. 2 may mean ‘‘no chance,’’ No. 
8, ‘‘domestie warfare,’ ete. Players may be divided into 
sides and the score kept to determine the winner. Each 
player gets one turn at throwing a dart at the big heart. 
Whichever small heart he hits records his score as well as 
his fortune. Darts may be easily made by using a feather, 
a cork, and a pin. A piece of paper crisscrossed in the 
eork makes a good substitute for the feather.

table. This game may be bought, or the cubes may be 
homemade. Get enough cubes of wood from some carpenter 
shop and mark the sides of each with the letters 
H-E-A-R-T-S. Each player in turn throws these out on the 
table. If an H turns up, it counts 5, H E counts 10, and 
so on. Of course if the thrower turns up two H’s he is 
not entitled to 10, nor to 20 if he turns up two H H’s. 
Five times around constitutes a game, and the boy and the 
girl with the highest score at each table progress to the next 
table, having tally cards punched. All players must record 
their own scores for each game on the tally cards. If any 
player turns three H’s, all the score made in that game 
previous to that throw is canceled. At the close scores are 
totaled, and suitable prizes may be given to the boy and 
the girl with the highest scores. 
Hot chocolate and heart-shaped cookies may be served 
for refreshments.

SUGGESTION FOR ‘‘EATS”’ 
It helps wonderfully to give things new names suitable 
to the occasion. Fr instance, lemonade need not be just

plain lemonade, but you may eall it ‘‘love potion.’’ Lady 
fingers would be ‘‘love caresses,’’ candy would be ‘‘love 
sweets,’’ cakes may be ‘‘Cupid cakes’’ or ‘‘Cupid con- 
fections,’’ and so on. 
It would be lots of fun to serve ice cream to couples and 
have them eat each from his or her saucer with spoons that 
are tied together with a string nine inches long. 
  
CUPID’S WHEEL OF FORTUNE 
Make a wheel of fortune out of cardboard. Mark it off in 
twelve sections, naming these sections ‘‘journey,’’ ‘‘suc- 
cess,’’ ‘‘true love,’’? ‘‘health,’’ ‘‘happiness,’’ ‘‘early 
marriage,’’ ‘‘wealth,’’? ‘‘matrimonial bliss,’’? ‘‘domestic 
trouble,’’ ‘‘single cussedness,’’ ete. Fasten an indicator 
to the center of the wheel and let each player have a spin 
to see what Cupid’s wheel has to tell him. 
  
BROKEN-HEART PUZZLE 
Supply each couple with a heavy paper or cardboard 
heart which has been cut in eight pieces like a jig-saw 
puzzle. These should all be cut alike, so that no couple 
will have an advantage. The first couple to put the heart 
together, thus mending the ‘‘broken’’ heart, may be given 
an appropriate prize.

WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY SOCIAL 
Write the invitations on small cardboard hatchets. You 
might request the guests to wear colonial costumes. 
Use plenty of bunting, flags, ete., for decorations. Have 
a large picture of Washington draped with bunting. George 
and Martha might receive the guests. 
Collection of Revolutionary Relics—Have catalogues 
typewritten, setting forth this great collection of colonial 
antiquities. Appoint some person as guide and have the 
company visit the exhibit in groups. 
. The Early Home of George Washington. 
Washington Crossing the Delaware.

some exhibits you can use. 
Living Pictures—Nothing is more entertaining than 
cleverly presented living pictures. Get some one to make 
a huge frame. Stand this out from the wall some distance, 
say ten feet, with long sticks running back on either side 
from the top of the frame to the wall, helping to hold 
the frame in place. These sticks also serve as a framework 
for the top and side covering. Drop dark-colored blankets 
down from the sticks to cover the sides, and cover the top 
by spreading blankets across. Of course any dark-colored 
heavy cloth will do for this covering of sides and top. 
Cover the front of the frame with mosquito netting. Drape 
a large box at the back of this inclosure to serve as a 
platform on which the participants may pose. Arrange 
for a light to shine inside the inclosure and upon the poser. 
Have the frame curtained off, letting pages in colonial 
costume pull the curtain aside when the picture is ready 
to show. All lights should be turned off while the picture 
is being presented except the light that is to shine on the 
picture. If the instructions are followed as outlined, the 
tableaux will be very effective. 
Put on the following program of songs and pictures: 
A Revolutionary Belle. 
. An Old-Time Beau. 
Solo or quartet, ‘‘Love’s Old Sweet Song.’’

ADDITIONAL WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY SUG- 
GESTIONS 
WASHINGTON 
Let each one see how many words he can make out of 
the word ‘‘Washington.’’ 
Fuaa Revay 
Have several teams of from five to ten runners each. 
The teams line up with the first runner on each team 
toeing the mark. Opposite each line is a tiny flag stuck 
in a half potato and standing erect on the floor. The first 
runner on each team at the signal runs to his flag, picks 
it up, and carries it back to the next runner, who in the 
meantime has moved up to the starting line. No. 2 starts 
as soon as he has been handed the flag, carries it back to 
the potato, sticks it in its original place, and rushes back 
to touch off No. 3, who in turn has moved up to the start- 
ing point. No. 3 gets the flag, hands it to No. 4, and so on. 
The first team to cover the course in this manner wins. 
Patriotic ANAGRAMS 
Lettered chips of cardboard are faced down on a table. 
Some one turns up a chip, showing the letter. The first 
player to call some word of patriotic suggestion receives

ber of chips at the close of the game. 
This game may be played progressively, piles of chips 
being placed on several tables. The players would count 
chips after a few minutes of play, note the number on a 
tally card, put back all chips, and allow the girl and boy 
with the highest score to progress to the next table. After 
twenty or thirty minutes of actual play, the game is called, 
scores totaled, and the winner announced.

KEWPIE SOCIAL FOR FEBRUARY 
Kewpie is Cupid brought up to date, so why not have a 
Kewpie social for Valentine night? Kewpie is Cupid in 
caricature, a sort of funny-page edition, and he has growr 
mighty popular in the last few years. He would serve 
 
-P-A-G-E-50

well as the central figure around which to plan your Feb- 
ruary social. 
Invitation Posters might be used in conspicuous places. 
A cut-out picture of Kewpie pasted on cardboard would 
make the setting for one of these posters. The following 
wording would complete your poster: 
*‘Leaguer, Leaguer, we’ve been thinking 
What a shame if you’d forget 
To come to our Kewpie social; 
It’s the best that we’ve had yet.’’ 
Kutie Kewpies—All have been requested to bring baby 
photographs of themselves. These are turned in to the 
committee on arrival. The committee numbers and regis- 
ters them as they are received, placing the proper name 
beside each number on a list kept for the purpose of check- 
ing up on the answers made by the guests. After most 
of the guests have arrived, place the pictures on exhibit, 
supply the crowd with paper and pencils, and have them 
guess who the different ‘‘Kuties’’ are. After a specified 
time, read the correct list in the hands of the committee 
and let each person check up on his own list. The person 
having the list most nearly correct should be recognized 
as the ‘‘Champeen Kutie’’ and should be appropriately 
decorated with such insignia as will attest that fact. A 
erown, badge, or medal with suitable inscription would 
answer the purpose. 
If the photographs could be got together before the 
evening of the social and properly numbered and listed, 
so much the better. 
Kewpie Set-Up Race.—Divide the crowd into two camps, 
the Kewpies and the Billikins. Ten representatives from 
each camp now engage in a race, lining up behind the 
starting line. Across the room, opposite each line of con- 
testants, has been drawn a circle about eighteen inches in
-P-A-G-E-51
  PHUNOLOGY 41 
diameter. Outside each circle stand three Indian clubs 
dressed in ballet skirts of tissue paper to represent Kew- 
pies. 
The race is conducted in relay fashion. The first man 
on each team runs to his circle, places the ‘‘Kewpies’”’ in 
upright position within the circle, and then rushes back 
to touch off the next runner in line. This player must 
be standing with both feet back of the starting line and 
is not privileged to run until his team-mate touches his 
outstretched hand. He proceeds to set up the ‘‘Kewpies”’ 
outside the circle once more. Thus it goes until all the 
members of the team have run. All ‘‘Kewpies’’ must be 
in upright position before a player can proceed farther. 
Should one fall after being set up, the runner must return 
and place it again in upright position before being allowed 
to touch off the next runner. 
The members of the winning team should be decorated 
with long cheesecloth sashes tied in big rows at the back. 
These should be worn the rest of the evening. 
Kewpie Quoits.—Six heart-shaped quoits should be made 
of heavy wire. Three of these should be covered with blue 
ribbon and three with pink. A gilt arrow should be made 
of wood and fastened to a base. This will then serve as 
a peg at which to toss the quoits. The Kewpies and Billi- 
kins again contest, every player being allowed a chance 
to toss the three quoits belonging to his side. Each ringer 
counts one point for the side. A box of heart-shaped 
mints may be given to the winning side. 
Kewpie Cut-Outs—Form two concentric circles with 
boys on the outside and girls on the inside. Let them 
march to music in opposite directions. When the music 
stops, the marchers stop and face one another. The couples 
thus formed are supplied with a piece of stiff paper eight 
by six inches and a piece of tissue paper somewhat larger. 
Each girl has been requested to bring a pair of scissors 
 
-P-A-G-E-52

  with ner to the social. Out of this material the girl is to 
eut a Kewpie arid the boy is to dress it. Judges decide 
which is the best. Ten-cent store Kewpie dolls may be 
awarded the winners. 
Kewpie Telegrams.—The same couples are furnished 
paper and pencils and told to write telegrams, using as 
initials the six letters K-E-W-P-I-E, thus: ‘‘Keep every- 
thing. Wrong Prices in Envelope.’’ Have each telegram 
read aloud. The vote of the crowd may be taken as to 
the best. 
Kewpie Fortunes——Kewpie dolls or paper imitations 
should be arranged in marked-off spaces on a table. Each 
should be dressed in a different color. One at a time the 
guests are blindfolded, turned about, and told to place 
one hand on the table. The Kewpie occupying the space 
indicates the fortune in a message printed in large letters 
on a card hanging from his neck. It may be advisable to 
change the position of the Kewpies every now and then 
to keep the players guessing. The Kewpies tell the fortunes 
in the following words: 
«“Kewpie red, 
Soon will wed. 
Kewpie blue, 
Lover true. 
Kewpie green, 
She’s a queen. 
(He’ll be mean.) 
Kewpie white, 
Life-long fight. 
Kewpie black, 
Never lack. 
Kewpie pink, 
Twice, I think.’’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  PHUNOLOGY 43 
Kewpie Jingle—Hach person is given a slip of paper on 
which are typewritten the verses of the Kewpie jingle, 
the last word in each line being omitted. These are to 
be filled in by the guests with double letters of the alpha- 
bet as indicated in the parenthesis. The person with the 
nearest correct list may be given some little book of jingles. 
  There was a Kewpie who was —— (YY) 
Enough to take no —— (EE)

savers (doughnuts), the latter especially for those who are 
getting out in deep water, may be served as refreshments.

VALENTINE QUARTETS 
Cut a number of comic valentines in four parts each. 
Hide the parts about the room. Begin your social by 
having all guests hunt for them. When a player has ob- 
tained one of the valentine parts, he proceeds to hunt for 
the persons with the other three parts. The first quartet 
to put together its valentine may be given some award. 
Note that it will be necessary to estimate your crowd 
before hiding the valentine parts that they may come out 
evenly. 
When the quartets have formed, announce that each 
group is to write a valentine couplet—that is, a rhyme of 
two lines. You might write a few words on the board as 
suggestions. Heart, dart; love, dove; mine, pine; thine, 
valentine—perhaps these would do. The quartet with the 
best couplet should be presented with a small box of candy 
hearts. 
Prironine Hearts 
Divide the crowd into two groups by having them line 
up and count off. All the even numbers will form one 
group and all the odds another. Furnish one side with 
tiny cardboard hearts of white or pink, and the other side 
with hearts of red, three to each player. Standing at a 
distance of some five or six feet, the players, one at a time, 
try to toss these hearts into a small basket or into one of 
those large heart-shaped candy boxes. After all players 
have participated, the hearts are counted to determine 
which side is winner.
-P-A-G-E-55
  PHUNOLOGY 45 
VALENTINE PuzzZLE 
Paste five or more comic valentines on a cardboard. Cut 
them in small pieces in picture-puzzle fashion. There 
should be five or more tables, with not more than five 
players to a table, and a puzzle for each table. In case of 
necessity, the number of players at a table may be in- 
creased. Hach player at the table takes his turn putting 
the puzzle together. Some one in the group acts as time- 
keeper, marking down the time required by each one. The 
player at the table with the fastest time is winner. The 
winners from the various tables then engage in an elimina- 
tion contest to determine the champion at the game. 
Sm VALENTINE 
This is an adaptation of the old game, ‘‘Who, Sir? I, 
Sir?’’? The players stand or sit in a line and count off, 
each remembering his number. One player stands in front 
of the line and says: ‘‘Sir Valentine has lost his love, all 
on account of No. 1.’? Immediately his number is ealled, 
No. 1 must say: ‘‘Who, sir? I, sir?’’ ‘‘Yes, sir! You, 
sir!’’ says Sir Valentine. ‘‘No, sir! Not I, sir!’’ ‘‘Who, 
then, sir?’’ ‘‘No. 6, sir.”’ 
Immediately his number is mentioned, No. 6 must say, 
“Who, sir? I, sir?’’ and the above dialogue is repeated, 
and so on, until some player is caught off his guard and 
Sir Valentine is enabled to command said player to go 
foot before he can respond. 
If No. 6, for instance, should be napping when his num- 
ber is called by No. 1, Sir Valentine would command, ‘‘No. 
6, go foot!’’ before he could get out his ‘‘Who, sir? I, 
sir?’’ No. 6 then takes his place at the foot, and all the 
players that had been below him move up one, and thus 
their numbers are changed. If Sir Valentine works rapidly, 
the game will move along merrily.
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 PHUNOLOGY — 
In very large crowds several groups should be formed 
with a Sir Valentine for each group. 
This is a rousing good game and keeps the players con- 
stantly on the alert lest they be sent to the foot. Should 
a player fail to use ‘‘sir’’ in the proper place, he is also 
demoted. 
VALENTINE ForTUNES 
Paste on a large heart valentines or pictures representing 
the following: An old maid, a moneybag, a bride, a laborer, 
a wedding bell, a wedding ring. Hang this heart on the 
wall. The players are blindfolded, one at a time, and sent 
toward the heart to touch one of the pictures with the 
index finger. This tells the fortune in the following 
manner: 
Old Maid. 
“*Since the old maid you choose, 
All chances you will lose.’’ 
Moneybag. 
‘*Riches will come to you some day, 
By marriage or another way.’’ 
Bride. 
‘*Happy marriage will be your lot; 
Fortune will frown on your rival’s plot.’’ 
Laborer. 
‘Hard work is writ in destiny 
For you, in winning victory.’’ 
Wedding Belt. 
‘*For you this year the chimes will ring; 
They’re wedding bells and everything.’’ 
Wedding Ring. 
**Don’t be discouraged; don’t you fret; 
For some poor soul you may fool yet.’’

A Viouer Romance 
This clever contest was used at one party we attended. 
The story was typewritten on small, white sheets of paper. 
These sheets were attached to a purple paper cover and 
was then folded. In the upper left-hand corner of the 
white sheet were two cleverly made paper violets, tied with 
a bit of yellow baby ribbon. Blank spaces in the romance 
were left to be filled in with words formed from the letters 
in the word ‘‘violet.’’ (The italics indicate the words to be 
omitted.) 
*¢O let me now narrate to you 
The story of a love so true. 
A youth named Leo once did dwell; 
His daily toil he did full well. 
No evil ways had he forsooth; 
He was indeed a model youth. 
To win a maiden he did try, 
With others eagerly did vie; 
Alas! the light of hope grew dim; 
The tender tie was not for him. 
He lost his maid he loved so well, 
And this is how that it befell: 
Quoth she: ‘Look you with favoring mind 
Upon the vote for womankind?’ 
‘No,’ he replied, ‘Ill tell you flat, 
I never fail to veto that.’ 
So ended then the romance brief; 
Instead of joy he found but grief.’’

IRISH BUBBLE PARTY 
Why not have something different for your St. Patrick’s 
social? Young folks get tired of the stereotyped ‘‘pro- 
grammy’’ affairs we so often palm off on them for socials. 
How about an ‘‘Irish Bubble Party’’? 
The Social Committee should meet and make enough 
tissue paper hats to provide one for everybody who comes 
to the social. Half the hats should be green and half 
white. They should be numbered, the green set being 
numbered in doubles from one on up and likewise the white 
set. Thus there will be two greens numbered one, two 
numbered two, ete. There would also be two whites num- 
bered one, two numbered two, ete. Every one who comes 
to the social is expected to wear one of these hats during 
the whole of the evening’s fun. The hats should be kept 
43 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  PHUNOLOGY 49 
in four separate piles, a boy’s pile and a girl’s pile for 
each color. The girl and boy having the same number and 
color become partners for the evening. 
The social opens with a grand march around the room 
to a piano accompaniment, everybody singing ‘‘The Wear- 
ing of the Green’’ or some other appropriate song. 
Then they are to gather at the several tables, on each 
of which are a bowl of soapsuds and a clay pipe for each 
player. The soap bubble contests then begin. Judges have 
been previously appointed. 
1. Largest Bubble—The person blowing the largest 
bubble at each table has a green ribbon bow tied on his 
pipe. These persons then contest, and the winner gets an 
additional bow. 
2. Partner Bubbles—Partners by putting their pipes 
elose together may make one large bubble. The partner¢ 
at each table making the largest bubble in this way get a 
green bow each. The winners then contest as before, and 
an extra green bow is allowed the winners of the final. 
3. Highest Bubble-——The person at each table to blow 
the highest bubble gets a green bow in this contest. As in 
the other contests, the winners contest for the additional 
bow. 
4. Most Bubbles—The person who can blow the most 
bubbles from one dip into the solution wins in this event. 
Winners at the various tables again contest to decide the 
champion. 
5. Through Wreath.—A wreath is hung in a convenient 
place, and each person able to blow a bubble through it gets 
a green bow. 
6. Bubble Tournament.—The Greens and the Whites line 
up against each other in this contest, about one and one- 
half feet on each side of a rope or line stretched across 
the room. The Greens are furnished with fans, the Whites 
with pipes and bubble solution. For five minutes the  
-P-A-G-E-60
  
50 PHUNOLOGY 
Whites blow bubbles and endeavor to have them break on 
the enemy’s side of the line. The Greens with their fans 
endeavor to prevent this. Judges award one point for 
every bubble that breaks in Green territory. The situation 
is then reversed, and for five minutes more the Greens try 
to blow bubbles into the White camp. 
The following is a good bubble solution recipe: Fill a 
preserve jar two-thirds full of boiling water. Add three 
ounces of castile soap finely shaven, a teaspoonful of sugar, 
and four tablespoonfuls of glycerin. Shake thoroughly and 
strain through a white cloth. 
Care should be taken to cover all tables used with oil- 
cloth or heavy paper. 
Clay pipes may be gotten through some dealer in town 
at something like eighty-five cents per hundred at whole- 
sale price. 
Shamrocks or little white clay pipes with a tiny green 
ribbon bow may be given as souvenirs. 
Refreshments: Sandwiches tied with green ribbon, olives, 
pickles, Irish potato chips, green tea, and green mints or 
eandy. Brick ice cream would also be appropriate. 
(This social may be used at any other time by eliminating 
the St. Patrick idea.) 
Busse Race 
Let two contestants each represent four sides, say the 
Murphys, the Caseys, the O’Briens, and the O’Malleys. 
One contestant on each team has a fan; the other is the 
pubble blower. At a given signal contestants blow one 
bubble each, shake it off the pipe, and the fanner tries to 
waft it toward the designated goal line. The first over 
the line wins. If the bubble breaks, the fanner may come 
back to the starting point and get another bubble to start 
on its way.

three bubbles at a turn, endeavoring to fan or blow them 
through the wickets. Five points are counted if the bubble 
goes through one wicket, ten if it goes through two of 
them, and fifteen if it goes through the third one before 
bursting. 
  
A PAT PARTY 
‘¢A great man was St. Pat, 
We assure you of that, 
And so we’re givin’ him a party, 
To honor his name 
And add to his fame, 
And we’re invitin’ you, my hearty.’’ 
Have Pat and Biddy meet all the guests as they arrive, 
giving to each a shamrock or a tiny Irish flag or a bit of 
green ribbon to wear. Pat meets all the ladies, and Biddy 
attends to the ‘‘gintlemen.’’ 
Snake Hunt.—Cut out tapering pieces of green paper 
and hide them about the room. The guest that finds the 
most snakes may be given some sort of prize—a toy snake, 
for instance. 
An Irish Potato Race.—Match the girls against the men 
in the following manner: Four chairs, two at each side 
of the room, are needed. On the chairs beside the con- 
testants are three potatoes each. With a spoon these must 
be carried across to the opposite chair, deposited there, 
and then they must be brought back in like manner. Count 
the wins to decide whether the Biddies or the Pats are 
victors.

  52 PHUNOLOGY 
This contest may be run in relay style, one runner carry- 
ing them across the course and another bringing them 
back. 
A ‘‘Pat’’ Contest—Give out paper and pencil and put 
the following questions on the blackboard for answer: 
1. Pat fighting for his country? 
2. Pat grown haughty and of noble birth? 
3. Pat playing with the baby?

Pat’s Hat.—Have some one draw a funny Irishman wear- 
ing a plug hat on a square of white muslin. Each player 
in turn is given a shamrock and, blindfolded, attempts to 
pin it to Pat’s hat. Those who succeed may draw for a 
prize. 
Irish Tenpins.—Divide your crowd into two sides now 
—the Murphys and the Caseys—and let them engage in 
an Irish tenpin contest. The tenpins are numbered from 
1 to 10, and contestants roll a long potato at them. A 
scorer will keep count and total the scores for each side.

AN IRISH FROLIC 
Invitation written in green ink: ‘‘Can yez attind a 
frolic and gineral divarsion on the 17th of March in the 
avenin’? Shure, ’tis wileum ye’ll be.’’ 
Have a supply of gold harps, green shamrocks, white 
pipes, and green snakes cut out of paper. Hach person 
as he arrives has either a harp, a shamrock, a pipe, or a 
snake pinned on him. This service may be performed by 
two uniformed ‘‘cops’’ or by two Irish colleens wearing 
little green crépe paper bonnets. 
The groups now form, the crowd having been equally 
divided between the harps, the shamrocks, the pipes, and 
the snakes. As the Irish are strong on politics, each group 
may ‘‘ilict’’ a leader, at least two candidates running for 
leader of each group. 
Irish Flag March.—Tiny Irish flags or square bits of 
green paper pasted on toothpicks have been stuck up about 
the room wherever possible. Some one plays the piano, 
and all four groups march around in a circle, clapping 
hands. When the music stops, which it does at unexpected 
intervals, all players scramble for the flags. Immediately 
the music strikes up all players must resume their march- 
ing and clapping. This continues until all the flags have 
been collected. The person with the largest number of 
flags is declared champion of Ireland. All flags in each 
group are also counted to determine which group is winner. 
A Green Contest—Each group is furnished the follow- 
ing list of questions, which must be answered in a specified 
time, the entire group working together on it (all answers 
contain the word ‘‘green’’ or its equivalent) :

12. A green that’s jealous? Green-eyed. 
13. A green that beautifies a country home? Green- 
sward. 
14. A green used extensively in the war? Grenade. 
The answers are read, each group marking its own paper 
and announcing how many answers were correct. 
The Blarney Race.—Each group is represented in the 
blarney race by a girl and a boy. The girls are lined up 
at one side of the room, the boys at the other. At a given 
signal each girl starts for her partner, holding in her hand 
a sealed envelope containing a single easy word. He must 
open the envelope and write a complimentary couplet as 
quickly as possible, using the word he finds in the envelope 
for the rhyme. For instance, the word in the envelope may 
be ‘‘pink.’’ So he may write: 
**O lassie divine, with cheeks so pink, 
You’re the sweetest girl in town, I think.’’ 
The girl then rushes back to the starting point with this 
bit of blarney, the first one back being declared winner. 
All couplets are then read to the crowd.

Irish Golf.—Allow the sides now to contest in a game of 
Irish golf. Of course a small potato is used as a golf 
ball. A lath with a piece tacked to it at one end at right 
angles will serve as a golf stick. The golf course is repre- 
sented by five tomato cans, one in the center and the four 
at equal distances out from it on four sides. These cans 
should have a section cut out of the side so that when the 
can is stood upright the ‘‘golf’’ ball may be driven into 
it. Contestants will start at the center and make a round 
in this manner; Ball is shoved or driven out from No. 1

2, he drives it back to No. 1, then to No. 3 and back to 
center, to No. 4 and center, to No. 5 and center. Hach 
time the player must ‘‘hole’’ the ball before proceeding. 
The number of strokes reyuired to complete the course 
marks the player’s score.. The group that finishes with 
the lowest score is declared the winner. The champion 
Irish golf player may also be determined by the individual 
scores. Players play orie at a time. If desired, a certain 
number of players may represent each group. It might 
be well to tack each :an to a block of wood at the back

MISCELLANEOUS 
Aw Invitation 
One Society sent out the following invitation to a St. 
Patrick’s party. It was written in green ink on white 
paper shamrocks: 
‘‘The 16th of March in the avenin’ 
Has been chosen by a few 
To have a St, Patrick’s party, 
And we’re invitin’ you. 
Please come and wear an Irish smile; 
We want you on the scene. 
Youll find the place quite aisily; 
’Twill all be trimmed in green.’’ 
Each person was given an Irish name on entering, and 
the boys were told to go to an arranged post office, where 
they were to secure the names of their partners and green 
hats for them to wear. Irish games were played, the con- 
cluding feature being the brbble tournament as outlined 
in the Irish Bubble Party.

Samrock APRONS 
Use large paper napkins or white tissue paper for skirt. 
Cut out enough green tissue paper shamrocks to’ make a 
border around the apron, which may be cut to shape de- 
sired. A double-fold strip of white tissue paper will serve 
as top of apron and belt. The shamrocks may be cut out 
of the decorated border in crépe paper, if that is available. 
It would be lots of fun to let the boys make these aprons

Six samples of different shades of green cloth and two 
squares of pasteboard. Cut samples in half. Paste one- 
half on one piece of cardboard and one-half on the other. 
Mark one set with letters or Roman numerals and the 
other with numbers, taking care that the matching pieces 
do not correspond except that they may correspond in one 
shade as a ‘‘catch.’’ One piece of cardboard is hung on 
one side of the room and the other across from it. Paper 
and pencils are given the players, and they are asked to 
write down the matching halves—thus, A-2, B-1, ete. Play- 
ers whose answers are correct may draw for a prize of 
some sort. 
IniseH Porato Race 
‘*Praties’’ may be propelled over the course with wands 
decorated with bows of green ribbon. Or the ordinary 
potato race may be run, setting out a row of five potatoes 
for each contestant. These are to be brought back one at 
a time and deposited in a basket, the first player finishing 
by getting all his potatoes in the basket in this manner 
winning. This may be varied by requiring contestants to 
hop or to carry the potatoes in a spoon. 
Porato 
Give five minutes for players to make as many words 
8s possible out of the letters in the word ‘‘potato.’’ 
ANIMAL SHOW 
Let players gather around a table on which are placed 
peanuts, raisins, prunes, a bunch of wooden toothpicks,

wire hairpins, ete. Each player receives a potato, out of 
which he must fashion an animal or hobgoblin of some sort, 
using the peanuts and fruit for heads and the toothpicks 
for limbs, tails, etc., as fancy dictates. At the end of ten 
minutes the different animals are arranged on the table 
for exhibition, and judges award prizes to those that seem 
the funniest. It may be possible afterwards to donate all 
the potatoes to some poor family, first giving the potatoes 
a washing. 
Kissine THE BuarNney STONE 
Whoever kisses the blarney stone will ever after say 
nothing but pleasant words. 
Get a smooth white stone. Scrub it well. Place it in 
the center of a small table. Blindfold the players and 
let them attempt to kiss it, no feeling about for location 
being allowed. The fairies say those who kiss the blarney 
stone will be successful ever afterwards. 
The spirit of contest may be injected into it by dividing 
into sides and awarding points for each successful attempt.

A pleasing program of Irish songs could be arranged. 
There’s something about the lilt and melody of an Irish 
song that always charms. Such songs as ‘‘Kathleen 
Mavourneen,’’ ‘‘The Harp That Once Through Tara’s 
Halls,’’ ‘‘The Wearing of the Green,’’ and ‘‘My Wild 
Trish Rose’’ might be used, as well as some of the popular 
Trish ballads of recent years. ‘‘Mother Machree’’ would 
be in this class. Get some songs on your program that 
every one can sing. 
REFRESHMENT SUGGESTIONS 
Pistachio ice cream, cakes with green icing, mint jello, 
lettuce sandwiches with mayonnaise dressing, green mints, 
green stick candy, olives, pickles, blarney sandwiches 
(tongue and chopped olives), and Hibernian or Irish 
punch. The latter is made in the following way: Make 
a strong lemonade, add a pint of lime juice, the juice of 
six oranges, and two grapefruit. Add plenty of crushed 
ice and water to suit taste.

CosTUMES 
All girls should be asked to come wearing gingham 
dresses with their hair plaited in pigtails. All boys should 
be asked to wear green ties and green vests if possible. 
It would be easy to cover the vests with green cheeseclotls 
or crépe paper. 
GAMES 
Pig in the Parlor 
This makes a good game to start off the evening’s fun, 
since it will serve as a good mixer. The crowd forms a 
circle with one player in the center. They take hold of 
hands and skip around the player in the center as they 
sing to the tune commonly used for ‘‘We Won’t Get Home 
Until Morning’’: 
“*Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
And he is Irish, too. 
And he is Irish, too, 
And he is Irish, too; 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
And he is Irish, too.’’ 
With the beginning of the next verse the players begin 
doing the grand right and left. Before starting, each 
player in the circle should have a partner, the boy being 
always at the girl’s left. The grand right and left is done 
by all girls marching clockwise and all boys marching in 
the opposite direction, beginning by giving the partner 
the right hand and passing on, reaching the left hand to
-P-A-G-E-72
62 PHUNOLOGY 
the next person coming toward you. Thus the players 
weave in and out, extending first the right hand and then 
the left. The player in the center drops into the line and 
participates in the march as they sing: 
‘‘Right hand to your partner, 
Left hand to your neighbor, 
Right hand to the next one, 
And all promenade.’’ 
At this last bit of advice to promenade each player seeks 
to get a partner and clasps hands with that person in 
skating position, marching or skipping then as they sing: 
“«And all promenade, 
And all promenade; 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor, 
Got a pig in the parlor; 
‘We’ll all promenade.’’ 
One player is left without a partner and goes to the 
venter. The game is thus played over and over as long 
as desired. 
If there are more girls than boys, let some of the girls 
tie handkerchiefs around their right arms and represent 
boys during the game. 
Pig Artists 
Hand each player a sheet of paper and a pencil. Re- 
quest that each one, with eyes closed, draw a pig without 
lifting the pencil from the paper except to make the eye. 
Have them sign their names and write some short message 
beneath the picture. Let players exchange papers for 
their own edification. With a small crowd it may be pos- 
sible to have all the drawings made in one book expressly 
fixed for the occasion. This book may be given asa prize 
to the one who makes the cleverest drawing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
PHUNOLOGY 63 
Pig Race 
Divide the crowd into two sides and have a pig race 
between representatives of the two groups. At intervals 
of several feet in two rows across the room place oyster 
crackers on pieces of paper. The racers must hop to the 
crackers one after another, stoop without touching the 
raised foot to the floor, pick the cracker up with the mouth, 
and eat it. Or they may be required to race on all fours. 
Pigtail Quartet 
Four girls with fairly good voices and pigtails stand 
in a row with their backs to the crowd. The director pulls 
the pigtails and the girls respond with some song such as 
‘Anne Laurie’”’ or ‘‘Old Folks at Home.’’ By pulling 
two or more of the pigtails at once he gets his effects of 
harmony. The first number should be made as good as 
possible. After that a humorous number can be introduced, 
the quartet singing ‘‘Sweet Ivory Soap’’ or some such 
song. At the end the director could pull off a false pigtail 
worn by one of the girls. 
Greasy Pig Relay 
Have from ten to twenty players from each side line 
up, facing one another. The head player on each team 
would start on signal and zigzag down his line, running 
around each player. He zigzags back in like manner to 
his original position. Immediately upon reaching his 
original position the player to his right does the same 
thing, zigzagging until he returns to his original position, 
not neglecting to run around the player at the head before 
finishing. The first team to have all its players perform 
in this manner wins the race. 
Pinning on a Pigtail 
This would be like the old game of pinning on the 
 
-P-A-G-E-74

donkey’s tail. The pigtail could be made by wrapping a 
piece of wire around a piece of hemp rope and giving it 
the desired curl. Let your best artist draw with charcoal 
a large-sized pig on a piece of muslin. 
Pig in the Pen 
Players stand in groups of three. Two hold hands and 
form the pen. The third is the pig and stands inside the 
pen. One odd pig is without a pen. On signal, which 
may be given by a whistle, all pigs must change pens, the 
odd pig trying to get a pen in the scramble. The one 
left out becomes odd pig, and the game starts over. Players 
forming the pens should change with the pigs occasionally 
that all may get the chance to be pigs. 
Another way to play this game is to introduce a chaser. 
The odd pig may save himself from being tagged by dodg- 
ing into a pen. The pig in that pen must vacate imme- 
diately and flee from the chaser. Should a pig be tagged 
he becomes chaser immediately and the chaser becomes pig. 
The game is most fun when the changes from one pen to 
another are rapid. 
Pig and Pie 
Have two or three boys representing each side engage 
in a pie-eating contest. The pies should be covered with 
meringue, and the contestants should be required to eat 
with their hands tied behind them. 
Pigtail Race 
Have from six to ten players represent each side. They 
divide up equally, and half the players line up at one end 
of the room and half at the other. The pigtails are made 
of heavy cardboard and are about one yard in length. Be
-P-A-G-E-75
  PHUNOLOGY 65 
eareful to see that all of them are the same length. The 
first player on each team is given two such pigtails. At 
the signal he starts across the room, laying the two pigtails 
end to end across the room. It is not allowable to lift 
one of the pigtails until the other is lying flat on the floor. 
Reaching the opposite side of the room, the player hands 
both pigtails to his team-mate there as soon as he touches 
the goal line. This player then starts back to the other 
side, measuring off in the same manner. And thus it goes 
until all players have covered the distance. 
Feeding the Pigs 
Have several couples represent each side. Blindfold 
them and furnish each person with a spoon and a bowl 
filled with cracker crumbs mixed with molasses. On signal 
all contestants start feeding their partners.

Use the old cobweb social idea, winding strings all over 
one side of the room, over chairs, under tables, over pic- 
tures, up- and downstairs, through doors, criss-crossing, 
tangling with other strings, ete. Each person takes hold 
of an end of the string and follows it to the other end, 
winding it around the hands as they proceed. Have a 
stick of candy or a sack of peanuts or a peanut shell with 
a fortune in it tied at the end of each string. 
TANGLED STUNT 
Play ‘‘Hurly Burly.’’ All the players stand in a circle. 
Each is given something to do by the leader, who whispers 
to each one. When all have been instructed the leader 
shouts ‘‘Hurly Burly,’’ and each one performs the stunt 
assigned him. 
Some have been asked to run in a cirele, some to crawl, 
some to bray, some to crow, some to jump an imaginary 
rope, some to prance up and down, ete. You can imagine

(Tangled cities may be worked out in the same way and 
substituted for tangled characters.) 
Hand each person a list of the tangled characters and 
give some award for the first correct untangled list. 
TANGLED ANSWERS 
Have each boy write a question and each girl an answer 
on a slip of paper. Let some one collect all the questions, 
mix them in a hat, and have each boy draw one. In like 
manner let some one collect the answers and redistribute 
them to the girls. Now have each boy ask the question on 
his slip of the girl opposite him. She in turn reads the 
answer given her. Let this be done loud and clear enough 
for every one to hear. 
WEAVER’S RELAY 
If you have plenty of room, divide your crowd into two 
circles and let them contest in the weaver’s relay race. 
One person drops back out of each circle. At the signal 
to go each starts weaving in and out of his circle in under 
the clasped hands of the two back of whom he stands, and 
out under the next, and so on until he arrives back at his 
original position in the circle. As soon as he resumes his 
place in the circle the person to his right begins the weay- 
ing process and so on until all the players have run. The 
first side to have all the players run in this manner wins. 
TANGLED PARTNERS 
Now have half as many strings as there are persons 
present. These should be cut about two feet in length and 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
    
PHUNOLOGY 69 
run through a hole in the center of a bit of paper. Suspend 
this from a chandelier or in a doorway. Have the girls 
stand on one side and the boys on the other. Hach girl 
and boy takes hold of an end of a string. When all have 
done so tell them to pull. The paper will be rent asunder, 
and the persons holding the same string are partners for 
the serving of refreshments. 
REFRESHMENTS 
The boys now retire from the room to reappear shortly, 
each with an apron on backward and each bearing a plate 
of refreshments for his partner. It would add to the fun 
if they backed in. After the girls are served the boys 
provide for themselves. 
Grape juice and cake would make simple and inexpensive 
refreshments. 
AN APRIL FISH PARTY 
“Poisson D’Avril’’ (April Fish) the French say instead 
of ‘‘April Fool.’’ The inference is that they are easily 
caught. A fish in that country is typical of the day. So 
why not cut out paper fish and write your invitations on 
them? 
Following up the fish idea, hand to guests portions of 
cardboard or paper fish and tell them to match for part- 
ners. You may arrange it so boys will find boys for 
partners and girls will discover that they match up with 
other girls. Or you may arrrange it so no two parts match, 
and after there has been sufficient scramble for partners 
you may call ‘‘April Fool.’’ In case the latter plan is 
used, add zest to the scramble by announcing a prize for 
the first two to match up as partners.

Still following up the ‘‘fish’’ idea, announce a ‘‘ fishing

and of course endeavors to ‘‘catch’’ as many fish as pos- 
sible. At the close of this game award a prize to the one 
who has the smallest number of fish. 
Fix up a booth or corner of the room and display this 
sign in front of it: ‘‘Step in and See the Big Fish.”’ A 
large mirror faces the victim as soon as he steps inside. 
Across it is written ‘‘April Fool.’’ 
v Fishing.—Now allow the company to do some fishing by 
answering the following questions with the names of fish: 
1. A prolonged cry? Wail (whale). 
2. A choir singer? Bass. 
8. The mariner’s dread? Rock. 
4. It’s awful slippery? Eel. 
5. It’s a good idea sometimes to come down off it? 
Perch. 
6. An animal that has practically disappeared? Buffalo. 
7. A persistent serenader? Cat. 
8. What we are liable to do in deep mud? Flounder. 
¥ 9. A weapon of warfare that’s more ornamental than 
useful in these times? Sword. 
10. Mother’s pride? Son (sun). 
711. Sometimes they shoot? Star. 
12. A censorious, complaining fish? Carp. 
13. A household pet? Dog. 
14. A swindler? Shark. 
A fish Relay.—Divide the company into several groups 
—the whales, the sharks, the eels, the buffaloes, ete—and 
let four girls and four boys represent each group in a fish 
relay. Each girl is provided with a glass of water and a 
teaspoon. At the signal the first girl on each team begins 
feeding her partner the water, a teaspoonful at a time.  
-P-A-G-E-81
    
PHUNOLOGY Wr: 
As soon as this couple finishes it must sing to the tune of 
‘““We Won’t Go Home Until Morning’’: 
‘One is born every minute, 
One is born every minute, 
One is born every minute, 
And that ain’t telling no lie.’’ 
Not until they have finished this can the next couple 
begin, and so on. The team finishing first marches around 
the other teams singing ‘‘One is born every minute.’’ 
Boys’ Fishing Contest—Now let all the girls gather in 
one room and all the boys in another. Two at a time the 
boys are to be invited into the room where the girls are, 
and~there they engage in a fishing contest. Two chairs 
are provided, as well as two fishponds (inverted shoe or 
suit boxes with slits cut in them, out of which cardboard 
fish protrude a few inches). A hole is punched in the 
fish’s head, and a fishing line and bent pinhook are pro- 
vided each fisher. The rules of the contest require the 
fishing to be done with one eye shut. To make sure that the 
contestants don’t peep, two girls are appointed to hold 
their right hands over each boy’s right eye. The palms of 
these hands have been previously smutted. The victims are 
allowed to remain in the room while others are brought in. 
Of course they must not allow the newcomers to see what 
has befallen them. 
Fishing for Partners.—Let the boys now fish for part- 
ners, a screen being put in front of the door of the room 
where the girls are and each boy.in turn dropping a fish- 
ing line over the screen. Some girl takes hold of it and 
becomes his partner for refreshments. 
Serve ‘‘sinkers’’ (doughnuts) “and ‘‘angler’s tea’’ 
(lemonade poured out of a jug) for refreshments.

72 PHUNOLOGY 
AN APRIL FOOL PARTY 
Have all sorts of April fool traps about the room. 
1. A handkerchief tacked to the floor. 
2. A mirror badly ‘‘cracked’’ by use of strips of paper 
and soap. 
8. A box of good candy labeled pee one”’ will last 
* surprisingly long. 
Give each guest a fool’s cap of 1, and white crépe 
paper. This is to be worn during the evening. 
The hostess may present to guests as they arrive a hand 
which comes off, to the amazement of the new arrival. 
This may be arranged by stuffing a long glove and holding 
it on a stick so as to conceal the real hand. 
Ask each one to write down the most foolish thing he or 
she ever did. Collect and read papers, asking players to 
guess the authorship of each one. 
Have a doll-dressing contest for all the boys, furnishing 
each one with a peanut, some tissue or crépe paper, needle, 
thread, pen and ink. Put them on exhibition and let the 
girls vote for the cleverest creation. Give as a prize a 
neatly wrapped box which, on being opened, is found to 
contain nothing. 
Divide the crowd now into two groups, the Jesters and 
the Jokes, by having them draw slips from a hat. Each 
group may be asked to put on a stunt. They may also 
engage in the following contests: 
Girls’ Whistling Contest—This may be conducted in one 
of two ways. (1) Select one or more girl contestants from 
each group. Let them stand facing the rest of the company 
and at a given signal begin whistling. It doesn’t matter 
what they whistle. The girl that continues whistling for 
the longest time wins. Opposing ‘‘rooters’’? may do all 
manner of things to make whistlers laugh. (2) Have one 
girl and one boy represent each group. The girls toe the 
     
-P-A-G-E-83
  PHUNOLOGY 73 
mark, the boys being across the room directly opposite 
their partners. Each girl is given a sealed envelope and at 
a given signal must run across to her partner, open the 
envelope, and whistle the tune indicated on a slip of paper 
inside the envelope. As soon as the boy recognizes the 
tune he writes the name of it on a slip of paper and hands 
it to the girl, who slips it into the envelope and races back 
to the starting point. The first to get back with the correct 
tune wins. Have some one present the winner with a fancy 
dish purchased at the ten-cent store. As he is about to 
hand it to her he stumbles and drops the dish, breaking it, 
seems disconcerted for a moment, but soon recovers him- 
self and says, ‘‘ April fool.’’ 
Fool Relay—Select four contestants for each group. 
Have teams line up, with the first runners in line toeing 
the mark. Each player holds a cardboard letter, there 
being one ‘‘F,’’ two ‘‘O’s,’’ and one ‘‘L,’”’ lining up in 
proper order, for each team. The contestants bearing ‘‘F”’ 
start walking to the designated goal in the following 
fashion: Four steps forward, about face, two steps back, 
about face, four steps forward, about face, two steps back, 
ete., until the goal is reached, when the contestant places 
his letter on the floor or sets it up against the wall, as 
the case may be, and returns, walking in the same manner. 
The second contestant has moved up to the starting line 
and starts as soon as No. 1 crosses the starting line. Each 
contestant must proceed as did No. 1, four steps forward, 
reverse, and two steps back. Mincing steps on the reverse 
movement are barred. The first team to spell ‘‘Fool’’ in 
this manner and have all its runners cover the course wins. 
Obstacle Race.—Select one contestant from each group. 
Place a number of obstacles in the race course—buckets, 
books, cups, tumblers, ete. Let them try the course first, 
walking through it. Then blindfold contestants. Now have 
some one remove all obstacles noiselessly and start your 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  
Th PHUNOLOGY 
race. If this is done cleverly enough, you will have some 
fancy high stepping to avoid knocking over or touching 
any of the obstacles, since one of the rules laid down is 
that each obstacle touched counts one point against the 
contestant. Contestants must walk and not attempt to run. 
To get partners for refreshments have a number of 
strings three-quarters of a yard long. Shut them between 
folding doors or catch in any ordinary door, so that the 
ends hang on either side. The boys are on one side and 
the girls on the other. Each person takes hold of a string, 
and when doors are opened, or when the door is opened, 
persons found holding the same piece are partners. 
Serve ‘‘tomato’’ salad, which proves to be a mixture of 
blood oranges, white grapes, and pecan nuts served in 
eucumber boats. Sandwiches with sliced bananas for filling 
will also be delightful. Sandwiches as slices of cake with 
nut filling wrapped in paper would also do. 
Chocolate cigars and cigarettes may be given out. 
April fool candy may be had at the candy store. It is 
well, however, in your serving to remember this bit of wis- 
dom from some writer: ‘‘Let your guest be fooled by un- 
expected tastes, but not unpalatable ones.’’ 
  
APRIL FOOL SUGGESTIONS 
Have misleading placards, directions on which lead the 
guests to unexpected places and mix the crowd. 
Have crazy greetings about the room, such as ‘‘Happy 
New Year,”’ etc. 
Have a quartet which, after an elaborate prelude on the 
piano, during which they arrange themselves, open and 
close their mouths without a single sound and take their 
seats. 
Have a Backward Social. Ask the girls to wear dresses

backward; the boys have their ties hanging down the back 
outside the coat. Let the players engage in a Japanese 
Crab Race, as described elsewhere in this book, or put on a 
Japanese Crab Relay. 
Fix up ice cream to resemble croquettes by plentifully 
sprinkling the cone-shaped portions with toasted cake 
crumbs.

A RAINBOW PARTY 
Invitations —Use the following lines from Byron on your 
invitations: 
‘*Be thou my rainbow to the storms of life, 
The evening beam that smiles the clouds away 
And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray.’’ 
The rest of the invitation reads: ‘‘Rainbow Party, April 
16 (name of organization, date and place). 
Decorations—Have a very riot of color everywhere. A 
huge rainbow can be effected by use of crépe paper or

cheesecloth in the seven prismatic colors. Over this draw 
a bit of white gauze to blend the colors. 
The following are the prismatic colors that must be kept 
in mind in working out this social: Violet (purple), indigo 
(dark blue), blue (light), green, yellow, orange, red. 
Rainbow Chase, or Seeking the Pot of Gold.—Hide some- 
where in the room a thimble or something of the sort, rep- 
resenting the pot of gold at the fcot of the rainbow. The 
players are to hunt for it. Each player as he finds it 
quietly takes his seat, not disturbing it and not tipping 
off other players as to its hiding place. 
Bow Contest—Give guests paper and pencil and a set 
of the following questions, which may be answered by words 
beginning or ending in ‘‘bow,’’ ‘‘bo,’”’ or ‘‘beau’’: 
1. An Old Testament bow? Boaz. 
2. Appellation given by Christ to two fiery disciples? 
Boanerges. 
3. A Hallowe’en bow? Bogy. 
4. An unconventional bow? Bohemian. 
5. A South American bow? Bolivia. 
6. A sausage bow? Bologna. 
7. A bow without fraud or deceit? Bona fide. 
8. A rich yielding bow? Bonanza.

10. A bow that’s always acceptable? Bonus. 
“11. A poorly fed bow? Bony. 
12. An acid bow? Boric. 
13. An animal bow? Bovine. 
14, A ne’er-do-well bow? Hobo. 
15. A dandy bow? Beau Brummel. 
16. A bow that is a dangerous weapon? Bowie knife. 
Making Wishes—The rainbow is a symbol of hope. 
Therefore a ‘‘wishing bee’’ would be appropriate. Let 
each person write a wish for some on else present, signing
-P-A-G-E-87
PHUNOLOGY WT 
the name of that person. All papers are handed in and 
read to the crowd. 
Rainbow Charades—Number sets of slips from one to 
seven. Let players draw and then find the rest in their 
group. Thus there will be seven groups. After all the 
groups have gathered let the social chairman whisper to 
the leader of each group the name of one of the colors of 
the rainbow. Give each group a few moments now to plan 
for acting out the name of its color. The rest of the groups 
guess what color the group represents. A vote might be 
taken or judges may act to decide which group most 
cleverly represents its color. Some suggestions follow: 
Purple (purr-pull).—Each of these syllables could be 
easily worked out. 
Indigo (Inn-dig-go).—Have some wayworn travelers reg- 
ister at a country inn, ete. 
Blue—Group could sit about disconsolate and tell one 
another their troubles. 
Green.—Have country boy show lack of knowledge of 
city ways or work ‘‘green’’ idea out in other ways. 
Yellow (yell-o or low).—Have the group march about in 
a circle, giving some yell. Or after a yell let them proceed 
to pass under the clasped hands of two persons, the hands 
being held so low that they have to go under on all fours. 
Orange (r-range).—Have the entire group do a bit of 
semaphore signaling by standing with arms extending 
straight out from the sides. This is R in the semaphore 
code. Then have boys pretend to be engaged in a battle 
with an unseen enemy. The gunner (using an overturned 
chair) may be instructed by the captain that his shot is 
‘too high,’’ ‘‘too low,’’ ete., until he gets the proper range. 
Red (read).—Have group sit on platform. One player 
finishes reading a newspaper and passes it to another. This 
persons passes it on with the information that he has 
read it.
-P-A-G-E-88
  
78 PHUNOLOGY 
The social chairman should be ready with suggestions 
for the groups if they need help. 
Rainbow Stab—Against the wall arrange a rainbow 
effect of colors, cutting the colors out of paper. Or arrange 
the rainbow colors like a fan, each color narrow at the 
bottom and spreading to a half foot at the top. Each color 
has a special number on it from one to seven. Players are 
blindfolded, provided with a pin stuck through a strip of 
white cloth, and sent up to stick this on the rainbow or 
fan. The player is credited with the number of points 
represented by the color thus stabbed. Each of the seven 
groups is represented by an equal number of contestants. 
Rainbow Relay.—Now select from the seven groups 
fourteen players to form two rainbow teams. Each team 
is given seven bits of cloth or ribbon in prismatic com- 
bination. Each player is given his color and a pin. A 
white cloth is hung at the opposite side of the room. The 
teams line up in the following order: Purple, indigo, blue, 
green, yellow, orange, and red. Both purples are toeing 
the mark and at a given signal hop to the white cloth 
and pin up their colors. They then can race back (not 
hop) to the starting point and touch off the next player in 
order, who has moved up to the starting point. The first 
team to finish its rainbow of colors and get back to the 
starting point wins. 
All the company can now gather about the piano and 
sing ‘‘I’m Always Chasing Rainbows.’’ 
For refreshments lct every one order by numbers from 
1 to 7 without informing them as to what the numbers 
mean. Three selections are allowed. Thus some one may 
select 1, 3, and 5, and the waiter would bring a tooth- 
pick, an empty glass, and a glass of water, the menu 
being as follows: 1. Toothpick. 2. Lemonade. 3. Empty 
glass. 4. Plate. 5. Glass of water. 6. Sandwich. 7. 
Cake. Of course after the bit of fun all are served lemon-
-P-A-G-E-89
  
PHUNOLOGY 79 
  ade, cake, and sandwiches, or whatever they lacked of this 
combination. 
ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS 
Rainbow fortunes might be told by placing disks of the 
different colors on a table and allowing the players blind- 
folded to touch a color. The colors may be shifted about 
after the player is blindfolded, so that he won’t be sure 
which spot to touch. 
1. Purple means renown and fame, 
You will win an honored name. 
2. Dark blue’s like the rolling sea, 
So a traveler you'll be. 
3. Since you wisely touch the blue, 
‘You will find a sweetheart true. 
4, Now, alas! you’ve chosen green, 
You will never wed, I ween. 
5. Yellow means abundant gold, 
Thus for you is wealth foretold. 
6 (a). Orange means this fate’s in store, 
You’ll wed one who’s been wed before. 
(0). Orange means your prospect’s bright, 
Your wife will let you out at night. 
7. Red for you this fate discloses, 
‘You’ll wed the first one who proposes. 
Another Party Idea.—You may arrange a series of seven 
stunts, or games, in which all can take part. Award the 
different colored ribbons for those who are among the first 
three in the different contests. Thus a hunt will be ar- 
ranged. The three with the largest number of finds will 
be awarded a purple ribbon, for instance. Cards are pro- 
   
-P-A-G-E-90

vided, and the colors are pasted on the cards as they are 
awarded. Or a series of progressive games could be worked 
out and ribbons be awarded winners instead of punching. 
the tally cards. 
All players completing the rainbow effect on their tally 
cards might be given some sort of award. 
The Cobweb Idea.—Still another way would be to use 
the old cobweb party idea, winding long pieces of string 
intricately about the room, over and under chairs, up- 
stairs, ete. Each person takes hold of one end of a string, 
and the fun begins as they wind here and there, crossing 
one another, tangling with one another, up the steps, then 
down again, finally coming to the end of the string just 
beneath and at one end of the big rainbow, where a prize 
of some sort is found tied to the string. It may be a small 
sack of candy or peanuts or some funny little souvenir. 
  
AN EASTER PARTY 
Invitations.—Write invitations on butterfly or egg- 
shaped cards. They may read after this fashion: ‘‘An 
eggs-ellent Easter party has been planned for Friday night 
by the ——. We are eggs-pecting you to be present. No 
eggs-cuse will be eggs-cepted. We begin eggs-actly at 
8 p.m.”’ é 
Partners.—Let girls form a line in one room and the boys 
in another, arranging both lines according to height. Have 
them march out, meet, and come up double file, so that the 
tallest become partners, and so on. 
Egg Hunt.—Now have an egg hunt, hiding paper eggs 
about the room. The couple finding the most eggs is de- 
clared winner. As prizes you might give them each a 
“Funny Easter Egg.’’ These may be made in the follow- 
ing manner: Empty an eggshell by pricking a hole in 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
PHUNOLOGY 81 
either end and blowing the contents out. Paint a face on 
it. Make the hole at the small end large enough to allow 
you to pour in a teaspoonful of small shot. Pour in melted 
wax on top of the shot. Glue over the top a little round 
cap of red or blue flannel. No matter how you stand it, 
it will always right itself. 
Easter Hat Show.—Each couple is now furnished with 
tissue paper, scissors, needle and thread, or paste, ete., and 
each boy is requested to make an Easter bonnet for his 
partner to wear. Some wonderful creations will result. 
When the hats have all been finished, the girls don them 
and parade before a committee of judges, who decide which 
is the cleverest creation. The boy who emerges as winner 
of this contest then appears before the judges, one of 
whom steps forward and says: ‘‘I am going to crush this 
egg over your hard head, and it isn’t hard-boiled either.’’ 
While saying this he does that very thing. The egg has 
been emptied of its contents and stuffed with confetti or 
tissue paper cut in tiny bits. Scent these by spraying with 
perfumery and cover open end of shell by using a bit of 
gold paper or a red or green seal. Decorate to suit taste. 
A similar egg may now be presented to the young man with 
the compliments of the judges. 
Divide the company now into three groups—the Bunnies, 
the Chicks, and the Bad Eggs. Let them engage in the 
following contests: 
Bunny Race.—One contestant will represent each group. 
They must stoop like ‘‘bunnies’’ and hop to a given. goal. 
Tie a bow of ribbon around the winning ‘‘bunny’s’’ neck. 
If the groups are small in number, every one may have a 
chance, running one race after another, scoring one point 
for each winning. 
Easter Tenpin.—An equal number of players from each 
group engage in this dntest, using every one present if 
possible. Little toy chickens are set up as tenpins, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 PHUNOLOGY 
the players bowl with a rubber ball. Have the chicks 
numbered from 1 to 10 (a smaller number may be used 
if you find them difficult to get) and far enough apart to 
keep the scoring from being too heavy. Allow each player 
three trials. Have a scorer keep track of the scores made. 
Decorate the room in yellow and white, which are the 
Easter colors; yellow as ‘‘emblem of the sun and typical 
of the goodness of God,’’ white as ‘‘typical of purity and 
all things made new.”’ 
ANOTHER EASTER SUGGESTION 
Egg Fortunes——Put paper eggs of various colors in a 
box. Players draw without looking. 
Draw the red, 
Never wed. 
Get the blue, 
Lovers’ true. 
Snatch the green, 
A husband (wife) that’s mean. 
If it’s the white, 
She (he) ’s here to-night. 
If you choose the brown, 
She (he) ’s in another town. 
If you should pick the pink, 
You’ll get a peach, I think, 
If you should get the yellow, 
You (she) ’ll get another fellow.

CHAPTER V 
MAY PROGRAMS 
Indoor Picnic. Indoor Lawn Party. 
Strawberry Social. Other Suggestions. 
  
INDOOR PICNIC 
This social indoor picnic may be used in May or any 
other month as well. 
Decorations.—Use branches of trees. Tie them to pillars 
or stand them in corners to represent trees. Potted plants 
will help out. One League holding this social in its Sun- 
day school room hung swings from the balcony, placed 
several seesaws about the room, covered the floor with 
leaves, and improvised a spring in one corner by making a 
mound of leaves around a bucket of clear, cold water. Here 
the picnickers could come for a drink. A lemonade stand 
where lemonade and cake are served is also a possibility. 
The picnic is a joint affair for the pupils of Sleepy 
Hollow and Podunk Sunday Schools. Superintendents 
have been appointed for these wide-awake schools, and 
every one is assigned to one group or the other. 
As one of the big features on such occasions is the con- 
test between the two schools for supremacy in certain 
events, so the contest idea may feature in the evening’s 
program. 
Merry-Go-Rounp 
First let everybody take a ride on the merry-go-round. 
Form a big circle and play the kindergarten game ‘‘Luby 
83
-P-A-G-E-94
  84 PHUNOLOGY 
Loo.’’ For those who don’t know this game the following 
brief explanation is necessary. The players all sing, suit- 
ing action to the words: 
**T put my right foot in, 
I put my right foot out, 
I give my foot a shake, shake, shake, 
And turn myself about.’” 
Chorus (all skip about in circle, taking holds of hands) : 
‘*Here we go, Luby Loo, 
Here we go, Luby light, 
Here we go, Luby Loo, 
On a Saturday night.’’ 
Then ‘‘I put my left foot in,’’ ete. 
“‘T put my right hand in,’’ ete. 
**T put my left hand in,’’ ete. 
**T put my head in,’’ ete. 
**T put my body in,’’ ete. 
(All march toward the center, then back on last verse.) 
Crisscross Bran Bae 
Line up at least ten contestants from each side, with con- 
testants alternating down the lines which face one another. 
Thus down one line will be first a Podunkite, then a Sleepy 
Hollowite, and so on down the line. The line facing them 
will have first a Sleepy Hollowite, then a Podunkite, and 
so on. Five white bean bags are given to the captain of 
one side, standing at the head of one line, and five red or 
blue bean bags to the captain standing at the head of the 
other line. At a given signal the captains start the bean 
bags one at a time down the line in zigzag fashion. That 
is, he tosses it to No. 2 in the line opposite him, No. 2
-P-A-G-E-95
  PHUNOLOGY 85 
tosses it across to No. 3, and so on. The first team getting 
all its bean bags back to its captain is given five points. 
Should a player throw to a player on the opposing team, 
or should he drop the bean bag, one point is credited to the 
opposing team for each error. 
PicTURES 
One of the features of most big pienics is the picture 
man who makes ’em while you wait. Stretch a sheet over a 
doorway. Place a lighted candle or arrange your lights 
so that a clear-cut shadow will show on the screen when a 
person stands back of it. Each Sunday school will take 
turn about guessing the names of the persons whose 
shadows show on the screen. First, one school will have 
the shadows of all its members shown, one at a time. Then 
the other school exchanges places with them, ‘The school 
guessing the most correctly wins. 
BasEBALL GAME 
Nine players represent each team. Those ‘‘at the bat’’ 
take places on the bench. The team in the field takes 
regular positions, and the game is played as described in 
‘Baseball Buzz.’’ 
Quorts 
A match game of quoits may be played with a ringtoss 
set. Two players could represent each Sunday school. 
Twenty-one points is out. 
FisHING 
Let all the girls gather in one room, all the boys in an- 
other. Put a screen across the door between and let the 
boys fish for partners. A boy steps up toward the screen 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
86 PHUNOLOGY 
with fishing pole and line. He tosses the line over the 
screen, and some girl takes hold of it and thus becomes 
his partner for ‘‘eats.’’ Thus each boy goes fishing for a 
partner. 
Eats 
The girls have prepared sandwiches, pickles, ete., and 
now all the company become seated in a large circle on the 
floor, the food being served out before them picnic fashion. 
Ice cream could be served in cones from a booth. 
Sones 
Close the evening’s program with the singing of some 
familiar songs. 
STRAWBERRY SOCIAL 
A strawberry social or festival always makes a strong 
appeal. One we attended at one time had the following 
most entertaining program: 
They had advertised as a special feature ‘‘A Mysterious 
Male Quartet.’’ No one but the members of the committee 
were ‘‘in’’ on it. At the proper time from another room 
came the strains of an old negro spiritual song, ‘‘I know 
the Lord has laid His hands on me.’’ The crowd began 
to sit up and take notice. As soon as this number was 
finished a quartet of negroes from a near-by negro church 
stepped out on the platform amid the applause that fol- 
lowed their singing. They then sang: ‘‘Couldn’t Hear 
Nobody Pray,’’ ‘‘Pearly Gates,’’ ete. This surprise put 
the crowd in a good frame of mind to enjoy the rest of the 
evening’s program. 
We next Matched for Partners. Pictures of men had 
been cut in two and passed around, half to the girls and 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  
  PHUNOLOGY 87 
half to the boys. These pictures had been cut out of 
fashion books gotten from a men’s clothing shop. 
The couples thus formed engaged now in a Man Com- 
pleter Game. Paper and pencil were given to each couple, 
with a list of the following questions: 
1, The man to be avoided? Mansion. 
2. The traveling man? Mango. 
3. The untruthful man? Manly. 
4. The man for the violent criminal? Manacle. 
5. The musical man? Mandolin. 
6. The gossiping man? Mantel. 
7. The stable man? Manger. 
8. The court man? Mandamus. 
9. The dye man? Human. 
10. The physician? Manicure. 
11. The literary man? Manuscript.

13. The many-sided man? Manifold.

The couple winning in this contest were invited to the 
platform. Two dishes of ice cream and strawberries and 
two spoons were placed on a small table. They were in- 
vited to sit on opposite sides of the table and feed one 
another ice cream and strawberries in full view of the 
crowd. Both entered into the spirit of the thing and much 
merriment resulted.

fun four teams of three men each took their places on the 
platform. Bananas were passed out. At a given signal 
the first man on each team began peeling and then eating 
his banana. As soon as he finished No. 2 began. The first 
team to consume the bananas in this fashion was declared 
winner. 
Strawberries, ice cream, and cake were served as re- 
freshments. 
  
OTHER MAY SUGGESTIONS 
An indoor lawn party would make a jolly occasion. 
Decorate with plants, benches, porch chairs, Japanese lan. 
terns, etc. Have the young people bring their banjos, 
ukuleles, and guitars. Sing popular songs and League 
“‘nep’’ songs. Let everything be done in informal style, 
but don’t allow things to drag. Play ‘‘Slang,’’ ‘‘Truth,”’ 
“Throwing the Handkerchief,’’ and any other games you 
think desirable. Light some candles and have a marsh- 
mallow roast. The marshmallows could be held over the 
flame on sharp-pointed sticks. Serve lemonade, colored 
with a few cupfuls of strawberry juice, and cake. 
Have a May-Time Party and play a lot of rollicking 
games. For ages the first day of May has been one of 
frolic. May games were played back in the Middle Ages. 
The Snow Frolic described for December can be easily 
adapted to this month, putting fortunes on the strings 
around the snowman’s neck instead of presents.

CHAPTER VI 
JUNE PROGRAMS 
A Flower Social. A Flag Party. 
A FLOWER SOCIAL 
Decorate with a profusion of flowers and plants. Make 
the room as attractive as possible. Write the invitations 
on pansies that have been cut out of paper and painted by 
the Social Committee. Ask each person to wear his birth 
month flower. Give each person on entering a rose to wear. 
Let these be pinned on by girls wearing garlands of flowers 
hung about the neck and a wreath of flowers on the head. 
Flower Hunt.—Write names of birth month flowers on 
slips, at least twenty for each month. Hide these about the 
room. Tell the players to hunt, but to pick up only those 
of their own month. For instance, one born in June could 
collect only ‘‘roses.’? The hunters must not assist one an- 
other in making discoveries of flowers. A short time is 
allowed for the hunt, when the social chairman or leader 
should blow a horn for the return of the hunters. Flowers 
are counted, and the winning boy and girl may be given 
an additional rose each. 
Birth Month Flowers—January, snowdrop; February, 
primrose; March, violet; April, daisy; May, hawthorn; 
June, rose; July, poppy; August, water lily; September, 
morning-glory or goldenrod; October, hop vine or aster; 
November, chrysanthemum; December, holly. 
A Floral Love Story.—Now pass out paper and pencils

names of flowers: 
1. Her name and the color of her hair? Marigold. 
2. Her brother’s name, and what he wrote it with? 
Jonquil. 
3. Her brother’s favorite musical instrument? Trum- 
pet. 
4. With what did his father punish him when he made 
too much noise with it? Goldenrod. 
5. What did the boy do? Balsam. 
6. At what time did his father awaken him? Four- 
o’clock. 
7. What did he say to him? Johnny-jump-up. 
8. What office did father hold in the church? Elder. 
9. What did she call her lover? Sweet William. 
10. What, being single, did he often lose? Bachelor’s 
button. 
11. What did he do when he proposed? Aster. 
12. What did he lay at her feet? Bleeding heart. 
13. What did she give him in return? Heartsease. 
14, What flower did he cultivate? Tulips. 
15. To whom did she refer him? Poppy. 
16. Who married them? Jack-in-the-pulpit. 
17. When he went away, what did she say to him? For- 
get-me-not. 
18. With what did she punish her children? lLady’s 
slipper. 
19. What hallowed their last days? Sweet peas. 
ANOTHER WRITING CONTEST 
1. What flower gives the time? Four-o’clock. 
2. What flower is an incessant traveler? Wandering 
Jew. 
8. What fiower illumines? Morning-glory.

4, What flower is festive? Hop. 
5. What flower is a popular man with the ladies? Sweet 
William. 
6. What flower is religious? Jack-in-the-pulpit. 
7. What flower has the names of two girls? Rosemary. 
Daisy Fortune Teller—Make several different bunches 
of paper daisies. These may be presided over by the 
Flower Queen, who directs that each player shall come 
forward and pull one leaf off of one daisy in each set. The 
words of the fortune are written with ink on the underside 
of the petals. The first set tells the seeker’s chief virtue, 
the next tells the greatest fault, the third the future oceupa- 
tion, and the fourth some future fate. 
Flower Garden.—Give each player the name of some 
flower. Have them sit in a circle with one player standing 
in the center. He may say: ‘‘I enter the flower garden, 
and I want a rose and a lily.’’ Players with those names 
must immediately change seats, while the center player 
endeavors to get one of the vacated seats. When he suc- 
ceeds the player losing out must take his place in the 
center. When the center player announces a ‘‘windstorm”’ 
all flowers must change seats, and in the general mix-up 
the player standing may endeavor to get a chair. 
A Rose Relay Race might be worked out, using the 
Shuttle Relay as a basis, the runners carrying a rose from 
one side of the course to the other. Or the Weaver’s 
Relay might be used, the first player carrying the rose, 
delivering it to the player to the right of his original 
position as he finishes. This player carries the rose as he 
weaves in and out and then passes it to the player to his 
right until the entire group has run and the rose has been 
returned to the first player to run. Immediately he re- 
ceives it he holds it high above his head so that the judges 
may see that his team has finished.  
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 PHUNOLOGY 
A Sunflower Minstrel feature may also be worked out 
for the entertainment of your crowd. Those who take part 
in this, of course, will be in black face, with a stiff, wide, 
yellow petal collar giving the sunflower effect. This may 
be fashioned by cutting your collar out of stiff cardboard 
and covering the petals with yellow cloth or paper. Or 
all participants may stick their heads through an opening 
in a long strip of cloth. Around each opening has been 
fashioned a large sunflower, either by painting or by sewing 
yellow petals on the cloth. Songs may be sung in this 
manner and jokes pulled off on persons present. ‘‘My 
Wild Irish Rose,’’ ‘‘The Rose of No Man’s Land,’’ ‘‘You 
Wore a Tulip,’’ ‘‘The Last Rose of Summer,’’ and any 
songs of this sort will fit in appropriately. 
  
A FLAG PARTY 
June 14 is Flag Day, making a flag party appropriate 
for that day. The social might be held on a large porch 
or on the lawn. When held out of doors, Japanese lanterns 
should be added to the decorating scheme. Have an abun- 
dance of flags everywhere. 
Stars 
Begin your program by having every one sing ‘‘The 
Star-Spangled Banner.’’ Then introduce some special 
musical numbers and readings appropriate for such an 
occasion. The ‘‘stars’’ will shine in these features. A 
suggested program follows: 
Reading: ‘‘Your Flag and My Flag.’’ Wilbur Nesbit. 
Solo: ‘‘Flag of My Heart.’? Werrenrath. (Victor 
Record.) 
Song: ‘‘Battle Hymn of the Republic.’’ (Make the 
congregational singing a feature of the program.)
-P-A-G-E-103
  PHUNOLOGY 93 
Reading: ‘‘The Name of Old Glory.’’ (James Whitcomb 
Riley.) 
Stunt: ‘‘How the Flag Was Made.’’ 
Two soldiers on guard duty pass each other. ‘‘Say, we 
ain’t got no flag,’’ says one of them. ‘‘Gee, ain’t it fierce?”’ 
is the reply. ‘‘I’ll see George about it.’? One soldier 
passes off the scene, and Gen. George Washington appears. 
Guard goes through burlesque salute and then says: ‘‘Say, 
George, we ain’t got no flag.’’ ‘‘Gee, ain’t it fierce?’’ re- 
plies George. ‘‘I’d better see Betsy about it.’’ The next 
scene shows George calling on Betsy Ross. ‘‘Betsy, we ain’t 
got no flag.’’ ‘‘I know, George. Ain’t it fierce? I think I’ll 
have to make one.’’ Betsy turns her back to the audience 
and pretends to be sewing a flag. Then she turns with 
the completed flag and waves it. 
StRIres 
Divide the party into two sides, the Reds and the Whites. 
Put on the Flag Relay as suggested in the chapter for 
February. Let the two groups engage in the flag contest, 
all the persons in each group working together on the 
answers to the questions asked. 
Flag Contest 
1. A stone or a flower? Flag. 
2. A fanatic who scourges himself? Flagellant. 
8. A musical instrument? Flageolet. 
4. The sort of spirit some Epworth Leaguers show? 
Flagging. 
5. A grossly wicked flag? Flagitious.

Other July Suggestions: 
‘¢Fats.’? Red, White, and Blue Party, 
Red, White, and Blue Contest. A Columbia Party. 
Artists’ Demonstration. Bubble Tennis. 
  
A PATRIOTIC PARTY 
Here’s a party that can be appropriately given on July 
4, Flag Day, or Washington’s birthday. 
Srvesone 
Have a rousing singsong, using many of the songs made 
popular during the war, such as ‘‘Keep the Home Fires 
Burning,’’ ‘‘Over There,’’ ‘‘There’s a Long, Long Trail,’’ 
“‘Liong Boy,’’ ‘‘Round Her Neck She Wore a Yellow Rib- 
bon,’’ ete. You might also use some of the familiar home 
songs and hymns. Close the singsong with the singing of 
“‘The Star-Spangled Banner,’’ every one standing, of 
course. 
Progressive CONVERSATION 
Form two circles, with the girls on the inner cirele and 
the boys on the outer one. Let the circles march in oppo- 
site directions to martial music. When the music stops, 
95
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 PHUNOLOGY 
the marchers stop and face one another. A leader an- 
nounces the first topic for conversation, allows them a 
short time to talk, then taps a bell. Each boy moves up 
one partner, another topic is announced, and so on. The 
leader should keep the movement lively by tapping the 
bell at short intervals, compelling a change of partners. 
The following subjects may be discussed: 
. Edison. 
. Patriotism or Pershing. 
. War or Woodrow Wilson or Washington. 
. Organized Patriotism—The American Legion. 
Russia or Revolutionary Days. 
Trenches or Training Camps. 
High Prices and the Nation’s Unrest. 
. Law and Order. 
. England. 
10. America or Army. 
11. Germany. 
12. U-Boats in the War. 
13. Enemies of Our Nation. 
CHONAME 
HYDE 
You will note that this list of topies makes an acrostie, 
spelling ‘‘Epworth League.’’ Ask if any one has dis- 
covered, during the game, the big topic for the whole 
evening. (Other names may be spelled in like manner, 
as above.)

Rineinea Liserty Bei 
Divide the company into three groups—the Reds, the 
Whites, and the Blues. Make a heavy cardboard bell of 
several thicknesses of cardboard. Cut a hole in the center 
of it some four inches in diameter. Hang this bell in a 
doorway, tying it with heavy strings at the top and on 
either side, holding it in place so it will not swing back 
and forth. Immediately behind the hole in the bell and
-P-A-G-E-107
PHUNOLOGY 97 
several inches back of it hangs a small bell. The idea is 
for players to stand some ten or more feet away and toss 
a tennis or small rubber ball through the hole, causing the 
bell to ring. Each player gets one try, and points are 
kept, the side totaling the greatest score winning. 
READING 
Have some one give James Whitcomb Riley’s ‘‘Old 
Glory’’ or ‘‘Your Flag and My Flag’’ as a reading, or 
any other patriotic number. 
SHuTtLe Fiac Revay 
Have the three groups represented in this race by teams 
of ten members each. Mark out zhe course and line up 
the teams in rows, half of each team being lined up on 
one side of the course and half on the other. Hand a 
small flag to the leader of each team. At a given signal 
three leaders run to the opposite side of the course, handing 
the flag to the first runner in line as he reaches the line. 
This runner immediately rushes to the opposite side, hand- 
ing it to No. 2 in the line just opposite, No. 2 having 
moved up to the starting point in the meantime, and so 
on. The team all of whose runners carry the flag across 
the course in quickest time wins. 
REFRESHMENTS 
Ice cream or hot chocolate and star-shaped cakes may 
be served. Also serve red, white, and blue mints. 
DECORATIONS 
Let there be a profusion of the national colors, flags, 
ete. Stick a potato full of tiny flags and hang it from 
the doorsill.

  98 PHUNOLOGY 
INTRODUCING GEORGE AND MRS. WASHINGTON | 
Here’s a stunt that’s full of fun. Put all the players 
out of the room and bring them in one at a time to meet 
the distinguished guests. One player acts as go-between, 
bringing the guests in and introducing them. George and 
Martha stand over in one corner. It is not necessary that 
they be in costume. The guest is brought forward and 
introduced with much to-do to Gen. George Washington, 
who expresses his pleasure as he shakes hands with the 
guest. The General now very graciously requests that the 
guest meet Mrs. Washington. This time when the victim 
holds out his hand to shake hands as Mrs. Washington 
extends hers, the General steps forward and shakes Mrs. 
Washington’s hand, leaving the guest with hand extended 
and feeling very foolish. 
  
OTHER JULY SUGGESTIONS 
“Hats’”” 
Chocolates done up in red tissue paper to look like 
torpedoes. Stick candy wrapped in red tissue paper to 
represent firecrackers. Stick tiny flag in individual cakes 
or in the ice cream. Wrap sandwiches in white tissue 
paper and tie with red, white, and blue striped ribbon. 
Serve, red, white, and blue stick candy, which may be 
obtained at any up-to-date confectioner’s. 
Rep, WuHiTs, AND BuuE ConTEST 
Arrange your company in couples. Give out papers, 
having written at the top ‘‘Red, White, and Blue,’’ each 
color being spaced off and a line drawn down the entire 
length of the paper, thus giving three columns. The part- 
ners work together on the contest. The couples contest to

see which can make the largest list of red, white, and blue 
articles or things. The boys write, and the girls dictate. 
The boys are not allowed: to do any suggesting, nor can 
they write anything except as the girls dictate. Only 
absolutely red articles may go in the red column, only 
white in the white column, only blue in the blue column. 
Red—blood, lips. White, snow, sugar. Blue—sky, violet. 
Artists’ DEMONSTRATION 
Select five persons to be artists for the crowd. Give 
each a slip of paper, with instructions to go to the black- 
board and draw with chalk the historical event written 
on the paper. Hach in turn steps up and draws the scene 
named. The first person guessing what is represented each 
time may get some sort of recognition. For instance, if 
the red, white, and blue party is put on, a red ribbon 
may be pasted on the card of the player. These are some 
of the subjects to be guessed: 
1. ‘*Washington Crossing the Delaware.’’ 
2. ‘‘Landing of the Pilgrims.’’ 
. ‘The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere.’’ 
. ‘Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac.” 
. ‘‘Betsy Ross Making the First American Flag.’’

A CotumBIA Party 
Decorate with flags, bunting, and Japanese lanterns. 
Have transparencies showing the dates 1776 and the pres- 
ent year. These can easily be made by using a little paste- 
board and tissue paper and should appear just outside the 
door. Uncle Sam and Columbia will receive the guests. 
Ask the girls to come dressed in erépe paper patriotic 
costumes. These can be made by sewing the crépe paper 
on old dresses. Give a prize for the most clever creation. 
Busse TENNIS 
For a lawn party or Fourth-of-July picnic a game of 
bubble tennis could be played. The company is divided 
into two sides or into as many groups as the size of the 
crowd demands. Not more than ten on a side should con- 
test at a time. The girls are to blow bubbles, and the boys 
are to endeavor to blow or fan them over the net, at the 
same time trying to keep the opposing side from sending 
them over. The side getting the most bubbles over the 
net wins, of course.

AUGUST PROGRAMS 
Gypsy Party. A Garden Party. 
Watermelon Feast. Circle Croquet. 
A Freeze-Up Party. Moonlight Picnic. 
  
GYPSY PARTY 
An announcement of a gypsy party ought to arouse con- 
siderable interest, especially if you link it up with the idea 
of a lawn party or, better, of a hike to some near-by park 
or outdoor beauty spot. Ask all the girls to come dressed 
in all sorts of gay-colored costumes—the velvet bodice when 
obtainable—with hair loose or braided down the pack. 
Yellow and red cheesecloth or a brilliant gingham would 
solve the dress problem. Ask the boys to come in old 
clothes, with bandana handkerchief about the neck instead 
of the stiff white collar. They may wear coats or not, at 
their pleasure. As it seems to be the style to wear shirts 
of various ‘‘loud’’ hues, young men blessed with pink or 
light blue or green shirts or any of the present-day ‘‘loud”’ 
creations would do well to doff the coat and wear a vest 
instead. 
A gypsy kettle on a tripod, ought to be part of the 
equipment. Three poles and a bit of wire will make 
the tripod. And of course you ought to have a camp fire. 
Lemonade might be served from the kettle. Or you might 
make effective use of it by filling it with water, building 
a good fire under it, dropping in wieners, and-having ‘‘hot 
101
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 PHUNOLOGY 
dogs’’ and rolls. Lots of marshmallows should be taken 
along so you can have a marshmallow roast. For this you 
cut a twig, point it, stick your marshmallow on the end, 
and hold it in the flame until it is browned a bit, making 
it a delicious confection. A wiener roast is another pos- 
sibility. 
It would be fun if you could take along some one who 
understands a little of palmistry and set up a fortune- 
telling tent. Or seat the crowd about on the ground and 
have them seat themselves one at a time before the ‘‘gypsy 
fortune teller’’ to learn the fate in store for them. 
KqpnarPer 
Play ‘‘Kidnaper,’’ which is an adaptation of ‘‘Rabbit,’’ 
described elsewhere. One player is ‘‘kidnaper,’’? and 
another is the ‘‘child.’’? The rest of the players form in 
groups of four, three joining hands forming the ‘‘home’’ 
and the fourth standing inside the home thus formed. The 
kidnaper starts after the child, who dodges in and out 
among the other groups. To save himself the child may 
take refuge in one of the homes by dodging in under the 
arms of the players. Immediately the player occupying 
that home must vacate, dodging out on the other side and 
becoming the child, fiecing from the kidnaper. The former 
child takes the place of one of the players forming the 
home, that player taking the center of the group. When 
a child is captured or tagged, he becomes kidnaper, and 
the former kidnaper takes the place of some player forming 
a home, that player becoming the child. 
Instead of the wiener plans a picnic lunch might be 
served. Of course, if the hike idea is adopted, you should 
select a moonlight night for your frolic.

‘WATERMELON FEAST 
Luscious watermelon has an appeal all its own. The 
feast may be arranged as a lawn affair, or a long auto 
truck ride may be taken out into the country. We know 
of one crowd of Epworth Leaguers who have a glorious 
time each year using the latter plan. They ride out to a 
country home, singing, laughing, joking, and bubbling over 
with the exuberance of youth. There they play games, 
such as drop the handkerchief, for instance, on the lawn, 
gather around the piano and sing, ete. The climax of the 
evening’s fun is the cutting and serving of the watermelons 
they have carried with them. A watermelon-eating contest 
may be put on, with the boys as contestants. They’ll be 
in it up to their ars, and it will be lots of fun. 
A Frenze-Up Party 
This should be held on the lawn or on the porch of some 
one’s home. Cover all the porch chairs and benches with 
white. Drop bunches of cotton on the branches of the 
plants and bushes, or cover them with papers and white 
cloths, as if to protect them from the frost. All decora- 
tions are white. Fines may be assessed on all speaking of 
hot weather, or forfeits required of them: The ice-guessing 
contest outlined in the ‘‘Snow Frolic’’ for December may 
be used. Or you might use this one, bringing in the 
‘freezer’? idea: 
1. What the cold weather is liable to do for you. Freesia 
(freeze ya). 
2. A mighty cold stone. Freestone (freeze stone). 
38. A cold proposition when it comes to ornamenting a 
wall. Frieze. 
4. A cold Teutonic country. Friesland. 
5. How a Frenchman in this country would describe a 
playful, gamboling spirit. Frisky (freeskee). 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  
104 PHUNOLOGY 
Play games with the ‘‘freeze-out’’ idea. For instance, 
play ‘‘Buzz,’’ having players making mistakes drop out; 
or play ‘‘Going to Jerusalem,’’ though you may call it 
“Going to Friesland or to Freeze-Out Town.’’ ‘‘The 
Laughing Handkerchief,’’ described in connection with the 
Pollyanna Social, would also make a good ‘‘freeze-out”’ 
game. For refreshments serve pear and pineapple salad 
with whipped cream, iced tea, and frosted cake. 
A GarpEN Party 
This could be made an attractive outdoor social function 
for August. Japanese lanterns, palms, and flowers are 
needed to add to the festive appearance. Ask the young 
people to bring their ‘‘ukes,’’ banjos, and guitars. En- 
courage informal group singing and playing. If a male 
quartet is available, it would add materially to the eve- 
ning’s entertainment. Or if you haven’t an organized quar- 
tet, a little encouragement to some of the young people 
who like to get together occasionally and ‘‘harmonize’’ 
some would help. Readings, solo-singing to ukelele ac- 
companiment, stringed-instrument selections, and games 
would make a delightful evening of fun. Serve sandwiches, 
salted peanuts, and iced grape juice, iced tea, or frappé. 
Circe Croquet or GOLF 
Dig twelve holes in a circle and one in the center. Use 
a ball that is golf size or an ordinary croquet ball. The 
player wins who can get around in the least number of 
strokes, beginning at the center, driving to one of the circle 
holes, and then on around the circle and back to the center, 
always ‘‘holing’’ the ball before proceeding. Sides may 
be chosen and scores kept to determine which is the win- 
ning side, or teams of thirteen each may contest, each 
player being assigned a hole. The center player starts the

PHUNOLOGY 105 
ball rolling toward player No. 1. No. 1 must endeavor 
to ‘‘hole’’ the ball from where it stops. As soon as No. i 
has ‘‘holed’’ it he takes it out and drives to No. 2, and 
so on around and back to center. Of course if any player 
*‘holes’’ it in one stroke as he drives it to his team-mate, 
so much the better. This game could be used to advantage 
at a picnic or outing. 
Moonuicur Picnic 
I got in touch with different men of our congregation 
who had machines and asked them to kindly lend them to 
as, which they gladly did. I asked them to promise to 
keep it a secret. So on the night of our business meeting, 
when the meeting was turned over to me, I had the lights 
all turned out and had the men who drove the machines 
to come in with toy guns and flashlights and make every 
one throw up his hands. Then I called off names, having 
prearranged them for different groups to go in different 
machines, so the crowds that went together were people 
who usually grouped together, thus making it more con- 
genial. They were led out to the sidewalk, without know- 
ing anything of what was going to take place, and when 
every one was in we started off. We went to one of our 
parks. There we had a spot arranged with Japanese lan- 
terns. We let everybody out there and then played old- 
time games and served refreshments. Every one who 
attended this affair pronounced it a great success. Of 
course this party was held in warm weather.—Prize stunt,

If you do, you’ll sure be glad; 
Play hookey, and you’ll get in bad.

To our old-time school party.’’ 
The schoolma’am, who has been previously appointed, 
comes attired for the occasion. Tally cards are handed the

guests as they arrive. They may be made to represent a 
book cover, and at the bottom may be written: 
‘School days, school days, 
Dear old golden-rule days.’’ 
The teacher rings the bell, and school opens. The girls 
have assembled in one room, the boys in another. Imme- 
diately on the ringing of the bell the piano strikes up 
“‘Tipperary,’’ ‘‘Over There,’’ or some other good popular 
tune, and the children march in from opposite directions, 
the two lines meeting and then marching around the room 
two by two. Thus they are matched up as partners for 
the first game. The children march around and take their 
places at the different tables. Standing at the tables, they 
sing the chorus of ‘‘School Days.’’ 
1. Progressive Arithmetic_—The teacher now announces 
that the first subject will be ‘‘Progressive Arithmetic.’’ 
Each table has been covered with paper on which are drawn 
four circles, reaching to the outer edge of the table. The 
intervening spaces are numbered 30, 35, 40, and the outer 
rim 50, A spool top is on each table. These can be easily 
made by cutting a spool in two and sharpening the cylin- 
drical part to a point. Into the top fit a small stick of 
wood, protruding at the top end enough to furnish sufficient 
grip for the spin and at the lower end protruding enough 
to furnish a suitable point. Each one at the table is al- 
lowed three spins—this always being done from the center. 
The space on which the top rests after spinning is counted 
for the spinner. Totals are noted on tally cards. Partners 
having the highest total move to the next table, having 
tally card punched. At the end the girl and the boy having 
the highest total receive each an extra punch. 
2. Reading.—The teacher calls up a few ‘‘star’’ pupils 
and hands out a list of tongue twisters to be read rapidly. 
If she thinks it best, she may line up the entire class and
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 PHUNOLOGY 
make each one read, urging them to greater speed and 
sending them to the foot for making mistakes. Here are 
a few: 
(1) Two toads teetotally trying to trot to Trixburg. 
(2) Five fantastic Frenchmen fanning five fainting females. 
(3) Six slippery snakes sliding slowly southward. 
(4) Nine nautical Norwegians nearing neighboring Norway. 
(5) Ten tiny toddling tots trying to train their tongues to trill. 
(6) A bitter biting bittern 
Bit a better brother bittern; 
And the bitter better bittern bit the bitter biter back. 
And the bitter bittern, bitten 
By the better bitten bittern, 
Said: ‘‘I’m a bitter biter bit, alack!’’ 
3. Geography.—Pupils are told to gather at same tables 
as for the arithmetic lesson. On each table is a heap of 
slips of paper on which are written letters of the alphabet, 
all face down. Each player in turn turns up a letter. 
The first at each table to call out the name of a city, river, 
mountain, ete., beginning with that letter, as directed by 
the teacher, takes up the slip. For instance, the teacher 
ealls ‘‘rivers.’? At one table ‘‘O’’ happens to be turned 
up, and some one shouts ‘‘Ohio’’ and takes up the slip. 
The boy and the girl with the largest number of slips after 
one round pass to the next table, having tally cards punched 
for geography, putting the slips back on the table. If the 
crowd is large, and this threatens to consume too much 
time, have the leaders at each table gather about one table 
to decide the ‘‘star’’ pupil in geography. 
4. Recess—The teacher rings the bell for recess. Some 
one has been appointed beforehand to start recess games. 
Play simple children’s games, such as ‘‘Sugar-Loaf Town,’’ 
‘‘Farmer’s in the Dell,’’ ete. The appearance of two or 
three lunch men, dressed in white caps, coats, and aprons 
and carrying trays of sandwiches, is the signal for breaking
-P-A-G-E-119
  
  PHUNOLOGY 109 
up the games. The tables have been moved out of the 
room and an old-fashioned well placed in the center. This 
well can be easily made by using a large dry goods box 
and covering it with white cheesecloth. Down inside is 
placed a bucket of ice-cold lemonade. Two girls take charge 
of the well and serve lemonade to all who come to the well. 
The lunch men appear a second time bearing trays of 
marshmallows. 
5. The bell rings, and recess is over. A Spelling Bee 
is to be the big feature following recess. Divide the crowd 
into two sides. You may have a regular spelling bee or 
one in which the contestants must spell the words backward, 
or you may hang two sets of letters on the individuals of 
the two sides and call out a word. The first side to spell 
the word by getting into proper position in front of their 
line scores a point. This may be continued until an agreed 
number of words have been spelled. 
One of the school trustees now steps forward and pre- 
sents prizes to the brightest boys and girls in the various 
studies. These should be inexpensive. Cardboard tags 
bearing suitable inscription, for instance, may serve as 
medal awards to prize winners.

A “‘POP”’ SOCIAL 
Invitation 
Surely we won’t need a cop 
To make you come to our ‘‘pop.”’ 
“‘Pop’’ Social—, 
Friday eve, September 24. 
“Better come, old top.’’ 
As each one arrives hand him an ear of pop corn and 
a wooden plate. Let him shell the corn, count the grains, 
remembering the count, putting it down on a slip of paper, 
and turning it in to the social chairman. He then pours 
the contents of his plate into a large receptacle designated 
for that purpose. When all have poured their corn into 
this receptacle, each person makes a guess as to the total 
number of grains, the one coming nearest to the correct 
number getting a prize. These guesses are written on slips 
of paper with the name of the guessers and turned in to 
the social chairman. The chairman in the meantime has 
added together all the individual slips first handed in, thus 
obtaining the correct total. 
Popping for Partners—Have the girls form a large 
circle. Bring the men in one at a time. Blindfold this 
one. Place the blindfolded player in the center of the 
circle and have the girls skip about him until he shouts 
“*Pop,’’ when they must all stop. He then points, and the 
girl toward whom he points becomes his partner. 
Popping Corn.—The men are now provided with poppers 
and proceed to pop the corn that has been shelled. After 
a large enough quantity has been popped, each one is given 
a needle and thread and a piece of ribbon or cloth strip 
about half an inch wide. ‘These latter should be of a 
variety of colors. The girls make watch chains for the

boys, and the boys necklaces for the girls, sewing the grains 
on the ribbons or strips of cloth. 
A Popping Contest—Give out paper and pencil to each 
couple and let them work together on the following pop- 
ping contest (words having ‘‘pop’’ in them) : 
. A Roman Catholic pop? Popery. i 
. A talkative pop? Popin-jay. 
. A tree pop? Poplar. 
. A pop in fabric? Poplin. 
A flower pop? Poppy. 
The pop of the common people? Populace. 
An uncertain but much-sought pop? Popularity. 
A political pop of some few years back? Populist. 
A thickly inhabited pop? Populous. 
10. A toy pop? Popgun. 
11. The pride of large cities? Population. 
Popping the Question—Have each boy write a proposal 
of marriage and let the girls vote by ballot as to the most 
clever production. Or have the boys ‘‘pop’’ the question 
as in ‘‘Progressive Proposal.’’ Conduct it after this man- 
ner: Each boy is allowed only a limited time to ‘‘pop”’ 
the question, a bell ringing to stop proceedings and to 
notify him to move on to the next girl. The girls en- 
deavor to keep the boys from coming to a definite proposal 
by all sorts of diverting remarks and by turning to the 
discussion to other channels. The boys are not permitted to 
propose abruptly, but must preface the proposal by intro- 
ductory remarks such as would be common. When a boy 
does succeed in ‘‘getting over’’ his proposal before the bell 
rings, the girl must give him a grain of pop corn to indi. 
cate the fact. Therefore each girl has a supply of pop corn 
at hand. The boy finishing up with the most grains of 
corn won in this manner is recognized as ‘‘champion 
popper.”’ 
In leap year the popping may be done by the girls.

HIKES AND WIENER OR MARSHMALLOW ROASTS 
September is a fine month for hikes and wiener roasts. 
You must be careful about the distance to be covered in 
your hikes. ‘‘Stag’’ hikes don’t require so much care. 
Boys are more rugged and can enjoy a hike that would 
simply wear some girls out. So make your hikes reason- 
able. Pick out a suitable destination both with regard to 
distance and natural beauty. Let the boys ‘‘tote the foot- 
in’s”’ to build a fire and have a good time roasting wieners 
or marshmallows. Sing songs as you hike along. Every 
soldier will tell you how singing helped him to forget the 
discomforts of a long hike or added joy to a short one. 
The writer has in mind two such incidents that will always 
appeal to him as times when the joy tide was high in his 
soul, 
  
A NEW HIKING SUGGESTION 
Recently we had a very successful affair in the shape 
of a trailing party. The Leaguers met at the church and 
were divided into two parties. The first party proceeded 
twenty minutes ahead of the second and dropped a trail 
—white confetti (or paper cut into small bits). The trail 
led down by an old pond, where we built a fire, cooked 
“thot dog,’’ roasted potatoes and marshmallows, played 
games, ete.—Miss Beryl W. Hundley.

_ Decorations make things interesting from the beginning. 
With curtains and screens make long. narrow, dimly lighted 
passages to caves made of brush piled together and covered 
with leaves. One of these, Mystery Hall, passes a number 
of Sunday school classrooms in which old witches have 
been placed who make gruesome noises. Make huge jack- 
o’-lanterns of old witches riding brooms and swing them 
on a drop with a red light in the center of some of the

classrooms. They look as if they are flying through the air. 
Mystery Hall parties are formed and are led by witches. 
Have the social parlors very dimly lighted, with an old 
spook wrapped in a sheet, holding a white kid glove stuffed 
with meal and soaked in ice water, to receive the guests. 
In front of one of the caves have an old witch telling 
fortunes. (Get the best palmist you can find.) Let another 
hall lead to Mystery Cave, in which witches serve from 
a menu (menus can be very artistically made and deco- 
rated) sidewalk slippers (bananas), fountain of youth 
(water), staff of life (bread), falling tears (onion), ete. 
Another hall leads to a cave or hut of an old witch who 
is serving the ‘‘witch’s brew’’ from an iron pot swung 
from three sticks over a fire (made of red lights and erépe 
paper). Punch may be served for the brew. Bobbing and 
biting of apples may be kept going on in other caves. 
An interesting Hallowe’en game: Let some one start 
making up a ghost story with two or three sentences and 
every one in turn add two or three more lines (any one 
talking out of time pays a forfeit) —Opal Wallace, Dallas, 
Texas. 
  
HALLOWE’EN SOCIAL 
One organization put on a Hallowe’en Social that was 
voted a success by those who attended. The affair was 
held in the Sunday school room. Jack-o’-lanterns faced 
one from every angle in the big room. The electric light 
globes about the room were covered with orange crépe 
(noninflammable) paper, eyes, nose, and mouth of black 
paper being pasted on them. Two pumpkins for decoration 
were made by stuffing orange crépe paper with newspaper 
and shaping like a pumpkin. Pumpkin heads were cut out 
of paper, pasted on black paper curtains, and hung about 
the room. On the platform a fortune teller’s booth was 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  
116 PHUNOLOGY 
built out of cornstalks and branches of autumn trees. 
Inside in the glow of a red light sat the fortune teller, 
who read the palms of those young people who presented 
themselves. A tripod and caldron occupied the center of 
the room, the floor beneath it being covered with cornstalks 
and apples. ‘‘Witch’s brew’’ (lemonade or frappé) was 
found in the caldron. The guests helped themselves to the 
apples. 
A ghost in the hall silently directed every one upstairs. 
At the top of the steps another ghost motioned them to 
a place where they could leave their wraps. They were 
then directed to walk around the baleony and enter the 
Sunday school room from steps on the other side. 
On the way around they had all sorts of ‘‘seary’’ ex- 
periences. At one place ‘‘Tige,’’ a boy dressed up as a 
dog, suddenly jumped out at them barking and growling. 
The young man who took this part had a suit made out 
of brown crépe paper, the same being sewed on an old 
suit of clothes. A short tail was made by wrapping cloth 
around a piece of wire and covering the whole thing with 
brown paper. A brown hood and false dog face completed 
his equipment, except that a small dog house had been 
improvised. ‘‘Tige’’? proved one of the ‘‘hits’’ of the 
evening. 
Further on an electric fan blew tissue paper streamers 
suddenly into the faces of the guests. Ghosts patrolled 
the balcony to prevent any excitable one from toppling 
over to the floor below in his fright. 
Just inside the door that led downstairs, in a dark 
passageway, stood another ghost, who insisted on shaking 
hands. He had a glove stuffed with wet sand on a stick, 
and you got that ‘‘creepy’’ feeling when you grasped the 
clammy thing. 
A witch waited at the door downstairs. She was intro- 
duced to each one and mumbled the name over to herself.
-P-A-G-E-127
  PHUNOLOGY 117 
A committee at the door attended to the introducing and 
then wrote the names of the arrivals on slips of paper, 
pinning these on the proper ones. 
1. As this was a crowd where a good many were un- 
acquainted, a get-acquainted stunt was in order. The girls 
formed an outer circle, the boys an inner circle, and 
marched in opposite directions to piano music. When the 
piano stopped, as it did at frequent intervals, the marchers 
stopped, faced one another, each learned the other’s name, 
and they conversed until the piano began playing, when 
they resumed the march. 
2. A ring, thimble, and penny had been hidden about the 
room, and the players were told to hunt them. When 
found they were inform:d that finding the ring indicated 
early marriage, the thimble single blessedness, and the 
penny wealth. 
8. Féte of Famous Ghosts—The witch called certain 
folks to meet with the Witches’ Council. The Witches’ 
Council, composed of the witches and a few members of the 
Social Committee, explained to the group chosen just what 
each was to do. The idea was to represent famous char- 
acters by covering the head with an old pillow casing in 
which eyes had been cut, and the body with a sheet, and 
indicating some telltale characteristic in some way. The 
persons called out by the witch impersonated these ghosts. 
The rest of the crowd were provided with paper and 
pencil and guessed the names of the famous ghosts. 
(1) George Washington, who walked across the platform 
earrying a hatchet and a bunch of cherries. 
(2) Eve, carrying an apple and dragging a toy snake 
across the floor. 
(3) Queen Elizabeth and Sir Walter Raleigh. Sir 
Walter put down a cloak (white rag), upon which the 
Queen crossed an imaginary mud puddle. 
(4)--Diogenes, carrying a lantern.  
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 PHUNOLOGY 
(5) Darwin, looking for the missing link. 
(6) Betsy Ross, sewing on American flag. 
(7) Napoleon, with white hat (paper) and folded arms. 
(8) Benjamin Franklin, with kite and key. 
(9) Theodore Roosevelt, with a big stick. 
(10) Carrie Nation. The witch stepped out and put up 
a sign with ‘‘Saloon’’ printed on it. Ghost carried rubber 
hatchet (obtainable at most ten-cent stores), destroyed the 
furniture in pantomime, and completed her wrecking ex- 
pedition by knocking down the sign and trampling on it. 
&4 A short, creepy ghost story was told by the witch, 
the crowd seated about on the floor, no light being furnished 
except such as came from a pan of salt saturated with 
alcohol. 
5. Blowing Out Candle.—Blindfold boy and girl. Turn 
them about and let them endeavor to blow out a lighted 
candle. 
6. Fortune-telling stunts: 
(1) Pumpkin with letters of the alphabet cut in it. 
Hang it from the transom of a door. Spin and let each 
take turn sticking a hatpin in it. The letter stabbed indi- 
cates the initial of the future life partner. 
(2) Three dishes are placed on a table, one with clear 
water, one with soapy water, the third empty. Blindfold 
participants. Lead them to the table and allow each one 
to touch a dish. If the finger is put in the clear water, 
it foretells happy marriage; soapy, marry a widow or 
widower; empty, single cussedress. 
Write fortunes on paper with lemon juice, which 
makes excellent invisible ink. One at a time each person 
visits the witch, who mumbles a few unintelligible words, 
then passes one of the strips of paper over a lighted candle 
and hands to the person waiting. Lo, the words of a 
fortune have appeared on what seemed to be a blank piece 
of paper!
-P-A-G-E-129
  
PHUNOLOGY 119 
Refreshments.—Apples, ginger snaps, and ‘‘witch’s 
brew’’ (lemonade with a little grape juice or loganberry 
juice added). 
HALLOWE’EN FROLIC 
Decorations—Remember that Hallowe’en decorations are 
necessary to the proper Hallowe’en atmosphere. 
Bobbing for Apples.—In order to break up that awkward 
period when you are waiting for the crowd to gather, start 
guests to bobbing for apples floating in a big tub of water. 
On each apple is cut or pinned an initial. 
Chamber of Horrors—Next the guests are conducted 
two at a time through the Chamber of Horrors, a dark 
room or passageway where all sorts of creepy things hap- 
pen. There is a rattling of chains, a terrifying noise made 
by scraping pieces of tin together, a ghost-guide who has 
a tantalizing way of frightening you with the use of a 
feather duster, though, of course, you don’t know it’s a 
feather duster. Then there is a giant ghost whose very 
presence is ‘‘scary’’ and everything. He may be standing 
on, stilts with back against the wall, and occasionally he 
moans piteously. Off in one dark corner every now and 
then two eyes flame for a second. These have been made 
by using empty eggshells in which have been inserted tiny 
electric light bulbs, which are flashed on and off. The 
ghost-guide tells a pitiful story about a friend who has 
died and makes each one handle parts of the dead man’s 
body. These parts are kept on plates placed on a long 
table or on chairs. The guide may direct the victim’s 
hands to each plate. It will not be necessary to lift the 
parts. As he comes to each one he moans and sobs out that 
“these are his poor dear eyes,” ete. If you don’t think 
this is some creepy experience, try it. The eyes are two 
hulled grapes, the tongue a raw oyster, the heart a piece 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
  
120 PHUNOLOGY 
of liver, the lungs a wet sponge, the brain a coil of rope 
dampened or a part of an ear of green corn. 
Pumpkin Head Game.—Make a pumpkin head out of 
heavy cardboard. Make a large cut-out mouth. Tack a 
wooden frame to your pumpkin head and a standard, so 
that it will stand in an erect or slanting position as desired. 
The crowd should be divided into two sides, and each 
player attempts to toss, by an underhand throw, a tennis 
ball through the pumpkin’s mouth, 
== Spook Minstrels—A clever spook minstrel could be 
worked out. Two spooks capture a negro who, on being 
asked his name, answers ‘‘Sambo,’’ and on a further de- 
mand for his other name tremblingly informs his captors 
that his ‘‘maiden name am Johnson.’’ Mephisto and a 
ghost chorus now enter the scene of action, and one of the 
ghosts informs the negro that he need not fear, for it’s no 
one but “Mephistopheles.’’ ‘‘Mephiswhoforlee?’’ queries 
Sambo. ‘‘Mephisto, Mephistopheles.’’ ‘‘Well,’’? answers 
Sambo, ‘‘it looks like the devil to me.’’ The ghost chorus 
may then sing slowly and as spookilv as possible to the 
tune of ‘‘ Auld Lang Syne’’: 
‘¢We’re looking for young men, young men 
‘Who plan to take no wife. 
We’ll put them in a dungeon dark 
And keep them there for life. 
We’re looking for young folks, young folks 
Who never help the League. 
We'll build a fire that’s roaring hot 
And skin them like a pig.’’ 
Sambo, during the singing of this song, may protest his 
innocence of the crimes mentioned. 
A number of local ‘‘hits’’ may be pulled off by having 
the two chief ghosts act as interlocutors and Sambo as the 
minstrel.
-P-A-G-E-131
  
PHUNOLOGY 12 
Some one may recite or sing: ‘‘The goblins’ll get you 
ef you don’t watch out.’’ 
“De Backslidin’ Brudder,’’ in Park’s Concert Quartets, 
would make a good number for a spook male quartet. ‘‘The 
Ghost of the Banjo Coon”’ and ‘‘The Ghost of the Terrible 
Blues’’ (Von Tilzer) would make good solo numbers. ‘‘I 
Want to Be Ready,’’ a negro spiritual, would also be good 
for solo, quartet, or chorus. 
Jumping the Candles—A dozen lighted candles are 
placed about two feet apart in a row across the room. Each 
candle represents a month. The young ladies are to hop 
from side to side over these, the candle that is snuffed out 
indicating the month of marriage. This feature should 
precede the spook minstrel, that being the closing feature 
of your program. Serve wieners and rye bread or ginger 
snaps and sweet cider. 
  
OTHER HALLOWE’EN SUGGESTIONS 
One organization had three fortune-telling booths. In 
one was a fortune wheel. This may be made by pinning an 
indicator on a piece of cardboard which has been marked 
off in twelve sections. The number at which the indicator 
points when it stops spinning indicates some fortune, a list 
being posted where all can read it. In another booth was 
a witch with the invisible ink fortunes which she ‘‘hocus- 
pocused’’ over a lighted candle. In still another booth 
was a gypsy palmist, who happened to be one of the mem- 
bers, who got off clever things because she knew a little 
about palmistry and a lot about her crowd. 
APPLE SEEDS 
Name two wet apple seeds and stick them on the fore 
head. The first seed to fall off indicates that the person 
for whom it is named is not true.
-P-A-G-E-132

122 PHUNOLOGY 
Apple SEED JINGLE 
The number of seeds in the apple tell the fortune after 
this fashion: 
**One, I love; two, I love; 
Three, I love, I say; 
Four, I love with all my heart; 
Five, I cast away; 
Six, he loves; seven, she loves; 
Eight, they both agree; 
Nine, he comes; ten, he tarries; 
Eleven, he courts; twelve, he marries.’? 
Fortune-TELLING PEANUTS 
Prepare these by removing the nuts and putting in tiny 
folded bits of paper on which are written such words as 
‘*journey,’’ ‘‘wealth,’’ ‘‘success,’’ ‘‘brunette,’’ ‘‘blonde,’’ 
etc. Give one to each guest. 
Yarn TEst 
Each girl drops a ball of yarn (ordinary string or 
thread will answer in a pinch) over the banister or balcony, 
holding tightly to one end and remaining unseen. The 
boys scramble for the ball, and when the yarn is drawn 
taut the girl calls: ‘‘Who holds?’’ The boy must reply 
with his true name. If the girl drops the end she holds, 
she will remain unmarried. If the yarn breaks, she will 
not marry any of those present. This scheme may also be 
used to arrange partners for refreshments. 
Countine SEEDS 
Each one is given an apple. The apple is to be cut in 
two, crossways, and the seeds counted. If two seeds are 
found, it indicates early marriage; three legacy; four,

PHUNOLOGY 123 
greath wealth; five, ocean trip; six, great public fame; 
seven, possession of any gift most desired by finder. 
Bran Fortune 
Give out little sacks of beans, making no effort to count 
them. Each person may tell his or her own fortune then 
after the manner in which we used to count off buttons 
on our coats: 
‘Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, 
Doctor, lawyer, merchant, chief. 
Rich girl, poor girl, beggar girl, crook, 
Schoolgirl, ’phone girl, servant girl, cook. 
This year, next year, no year, darn; 
Big house, little house, hotel, barn.’’ 
A Giant GHostT 
At one party a giant ghost met every one as he stepped

funny when he bowed almost to the floor. He also had a 
peculiar habit of dwindling in size until he appeared only 
of normal height. Here is the secret: A ghost’s head had 
been fastened on the end of a broom, a sheet was fastened 
about it at the neck, and the entire thing held up by a girl 
or boy inside, who held the broom by the handle, raising 
or lowering it at pleasure. 
A Gosiin Party 
Why not have a goblin party and have the guests come 
wearing a covering of sheets and old pillow slips? Number 
the goblins as they arrive, pinning the number on the

may be awarded some prize. 
  
A BLACK-CAT PARTY 
Invitation —‘‘The black cats are going to convene Mon- 
day evening, October 31, at eight o’clock. Be on hand 
for the fun.’’ (Name of organization, date and place.) 
Decorate with all sorts and sizes of paper black cats. 
Play ‘‘Poor Little Pussy Cat,’’ ‘‘Pussy Wants a Corner,’’ 
““Cat and Mouse,’’ and ‘‘The Minister’s Cat.’’ The latter 
game is played after this fashion: The players seat them- 
selves about in a circle, with one player in the center. He 
throws a knotted handkerchief at one of the players and 
says: ‘‘The minister’s cat is——.’’? The player hit must 
finish the sentence with some word descriptive of the cat 
and beginning with the letter ‘‘A.’’ Thus he answers: 
““An ambitious cat,’’ ‘‘An agile cat,’’ ‘‘An ancient cat,’’ 
etc. Failure to respond at once or repetition of an adjec- 
tive already used puts one out of the game. This is kept 
up until only one player is able to respond. When one 
detter is exhausted another may be chosen. 
The following ‘‘cat’’ contest may be used: 
1. A cat in a deluge? Cataclysm. 
2. A cat in a place of burial? Catacomb. 
8. A Roman cat? Cataline. 
4. A cat that has fits? Cataleptic.

The Black-Cat Society may now be organized, the first 
thing in order being the election of a Chief Howler. Make 
the election as exciting and amusing as possible by the 
nomination of several people, having some one present the 
claims of each. The Chief Howler now takes charge and 
commands all brother and sister black cats to join in the 
society anthem. He then begins: 
‘Three blind mice, 
Three blind mice. 
See how they run, 
See how they run. 
They all ran after the farmer’s wife, 
She cut off their tails with a carving knife. 
Three blind mice,’’ ete. 
The person to the right of the Chief Howler begins the 
song for himself by the time the Chief Howler has reached 
the second line. And so with the person to the right of 
this one, and all the way around, each singing with com- 
placent disregard of the other. Over and over they sing it. 
It ought to be a ‘‘howling success.’? The Chief Howler 
raps for order when he figures the society anthem has been 
given its due emphasis and announces: ‘‘All in favor of 
adjourning for ‘eats’ say ‘Meow.’’’ All the black cats 
answer with a chorus of ‘‘Meows,’’ of course. 
Sweet milk and pie may be served. A milk-drinking 
contest may be put on, with some of the boys as contestants,

CG MEETING THE QUEEN OF HALLOWE’EN 
All guests, one at a time, must appear before the Queen 
of Hallowe’en, kneel, and lift the right hand for her 
blessing. The queen, with pasteboard crown, sits on her 
throne over in one corner. She wears on her right hand a 
glove, which has sewed in its palm a copper wire, off the 
end of which has been scraped the insulation. This wire 
runs around back of her to the floor, where it is connected 
with a battery. This battery is so arranged that the queen 
ean throw on the ‘‘juice’’ by stepping on a switch. The 
switch and battery, of course, are covered by her dress. 
As the victim kneels and extends his hand, the queen grasps 
it as if to shake hands, throws on the switch, and the suk 
ject leaps to his feet with a wild yell.

NOVEMBER PROGRAMS 
A Football Social. A Thanksgiving Party. 
Another Football Game. “*Pass It,’’ with November Articles. 
Harvest Home Social. A Pilgrim Party. 
  
A FOOTBALL SOCIAL 
Each one as he comes in has a number pinned on his 
back, football style. Two sets of numbers have been pro- 
vided—namely, A and B sets. Girls get even numbers, 
boys odd. Thus 1-A or 1-B would be a boy, and 2-A or 
2-B would be a girl. 
1. Get Acquainted—Form two circles, girls inner, boys 
outer. March to music in opposite directions. When the 
music stops, marchers stop and face each other. Each 
shouts his or her own name in a loud voice. They converse 
until the music starts. Then as it starts each one shouts 
the name of the person opposite and begins to march as 
before. 
2. Football Guessing Contest.—Answers are to be made 
in musical terms: 
(1) What does the line need to do when hard pressed ? 
Brace. 
(2) What decides the game? Score. 
(3) What kind of a football player does the coach call 
a man who on his first time out plays a fine game? Natural. 
(4) What does a football player who has been punched 
in the stomach need? Air. 
127  
-P-A-G-E-138

(5) With the score a tie, for what does the better team 
pray? Time. 
(6) What does each team want to do? Beat. 
(T) What do players do on a muddy field when tackled? 
(8) What do players do between quarters? Rest. 
(9) What is the coaching squad sometimes called? 
(10) What is a game where neither side scores? Tie. 
(11) What do they often do to determine whether or 
not a team has made first down? Measure. 
(12) Of what two terms would you be reminded by a 
back field dressed in polka dot jerseys? Dotted quarter 
and dotted half. 
(13) What kind of head often spoils a good player? 
Swell. 
(14) For whom does she root at the game? Hymn 
(him). 
3. Shouting Proverbs.—Call out several groups of six 
numbers each, calling three odd and three even numbers 
for each group. These groups then decide, each, on some 
proverb of six words, as, for instance: ‘‘Make hay while 
the sun shines,’’ ‘‘ All that glitters is not gold,’’ ‘‘A stitch 
in time saves nine.’’? Each person in the group is given 
one word of the proverb, and by one group at a time the 
proverb is shouted, each person in the group shouting his 
word simultaneously with the others in the group. The 
rest of the crowd guesses what the proverb is. 
4, Surprise Quartets—Call for groups of four members 
each, calling two odd and two even numbers for each group. 
These groups form quartets and must sing some song of 
their own selection. After each of the four quartets has 
performed, all four sing at the same time, each singing its 
own song. The judges, previously appointed, decide which 
is the worst quartet and give it some adequate recognition.
-P-A-G-E-139
  PHUNOLOGY 129 
5. Championship Football Contest between the A’s and 
B’s.—Cover table with green paper or cloth. Mark off like 
a football field, placing goal posts at each end. These can 
be easily made out of sticks of wood. Empty an eggshell 
of its contents and color it brown. Mark seams and lacing 
with ink so as to make the shell resemble a football as 
much as possible. It might be well to have another in 
reserve, so no interruption of the game will be occasioned 
by the breaking of the shell. The shell is placed in the 
eenter of the field, and contestants take turn in trying to 
blow it through the goal posts at the opponent’s end of the 
table. Each successful attempt scores a touchdown for the 
team making it. The ball is placed in mid-field each time. 
Each side should select eleven players to represent them. 
The first half shall be considered played when each con- 
testant on the two elevens has blown once. The game is 
ended when each team has had two chances for each mem- 
ber of the team. 
A variation of this plan is to place the ball in mid-field 
and at the sound of the whistle to have all the members of 
each team begin to blow. In this case a touchdown is 
scored when the ball goes over the goal line in bounds. 
When the ball is blown out of bounds, the referee puts it 
back out from the point where it went out of bounds. 
When the ball goes out of bounds, neither team is to begin 
to blow until the referee’s whistle shall sound. Breaking 
this rule shall be considered an off-side play, and a penalty 
of ‘‘five yards’’ will be made. 
The two sides are expected to root for their representa- 
tives during the progress of the game.
-P-A-G-E-140
  130 PHUNOLOGY 
ANOTHER FOOTBALL GAME 
1. Mark out on the floor a football field with ‘‘ten-yard 
lines.”’ 
2. Equipment.—A football, a baseball, and twenty-two 
Indian clubs or long-necked bottles; two sets of eleven slips 
of paper each, on which the following plays are written: 
(1) Forward pass, ten yards. 
(2) Penalty for holding, ten yards. 
(3) End run, thirty yards. 
(4) Penalty for off-side play, five yards. 
(5) Line plunges, fifteen yards. 
(6) Penalty for slugging, fifteen yards. 
(7) Penalty for coaching from the side lines, ten yards. 
(8) ‘‘Safety,’’ score two. 
(9) Touchdown, score six. 
(10) Field goal, score three. 
(11) Penalty for unnecessary roughness to player re- 
ceiving a forward pass, ten yards. 
3. The company is divided into two groups. Eleven 
players represent each group. <A yell leader should be 
appointed for each side and should keep enthusiasm at a 
high pitch. 
4, At each goal line eleven Indian clubs are placed in a 
row a foot apart, and one of the prepared written plays is 
placed under each club. 
5. The players line up behind the clubs. 
6. Captains draw for first play. 
7. The football is placed in the middle of the ‘‘field,’’ 
and the baseball is given to the captain of the side to play 
first. That captain rolls the ball at the opponents’ Indian 
elubs. Three trials may be allowed. If the ball knocks 
down or hits a club, the slip beneath indicates the play. 
The umpire moves the football accordingly, registering
-P-A-G-E-141
  
PHUNOLOGY 181 
either a penalty or a gain. Each player tries in turn, the 
sides alternating in rolling the ball. 
8. A scorekeeper keeps account of the scores made. 
9. One time around may be considered a quarter. At the 
end of the half the ball goes back to the center, before the 
third quarter begins. 
  
HARVEST HOME SOCIAL 
Have the guests come dressed in country costumes of 
sundry character. For instance, there may be the village 
gossip, the village conscience, the village belle, the village 
old maid, the country dude, the farmer, storekeeper, 
constable, ete. Award a prize for the best make-up. Lan- 
terns, oil lamps, and candles are used for lights. Stalks 
of corn, pumpkins, ears of corn, and autumn leaves serve 
as decorations. Play rollicking old-fashioned games, such 
as ‘‘The Jolly Miller,’’ ‘‘Drop the Handkerchief,’’ ‘‘ Jacob 
and Rachel,’’ ‘‘Going to Jerusalem,’’ ete. A pumpkin seed 
hunt may be used to begin the fun. 
The Village Orchestra may perform at some place in the 
evening’s program. Each one chooses an imaginary in- 
strument. The leader announces the tune and then begins 
playing, making appropriate noise and movement for the 
instrument he selects. Alf players play their respective 
instruments in the same manner. The leader may be 
playing the flute. If he stops suddenly and begins playing 
the violin, then the violin player must take up the fiute. 
The leader may change any time the notion strikes him. 
Any player failing to make the changes at the proper time 
must pay a forfeit. 
A Village Scandal may be enacted by having a mock 
trial in which Mr. Cy Sweeter may be tried for breach of 
promise. Miss Sadie Soothum is the plaintiff, and Judge 
Heeza Pest presides. The notables of the village are called

Hon. Hezekiah Goose as attorney for the defendant. 
Serve sandwiches, cookies, and coffee. 
  
A THANKSGIVING PARTY 
Decorate with chrysanthemums, corn, pumpkins, autumn 
leaves, footballs, fruit, vegetables, etc. Hach one may be 
asked to bring some donation in food or clothing to be 
used by the Social Service Committee in helping the needy. 
As each guest arrives have him write on a slip of paper 
his name and a number which indicates his guess on the 
number of petals on a large chrysanthemum in a vase near 
by. The paper is then pinned on the guesser and serves 
as an ‘‘ice breaker.’’ After the apple race the petals may 
be counted and the winner awarded a chrysanthemum or 
some other inexpensive prize. 
The Apple Race is next in order. Divide your party 
into two or more sides. Have them stand in straight lines 
facing one another and some four feet apart. An apple is 
given the leader of each line. At a given signal each starts 
the apple down his line, placing it with two hands into 
the two hands of the person next to him. This person 
passes it to the next in the same manner, and so on down 
the line. The end person receives it and then runs as 
fast as possible to the head of the line, starting the apple 
down once more. This is continued until one side has had 
all of its players run with the apple, thus getting the 
original No. 1 back at the head. Players run on the inside 
of the lines. 
Now count your chrysanthemum petals before the crowd 
and announce the winner of the guessing contest. 
Pass paper and pencils and give every one ten minutes 
to see how many words can be made out of the letters in 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  PHUNOLOGY 133 
‘‘chrysanthemum.’’ Fix up a pasteboard imitation medal 
with the inscription, ‘‘Champion Word Slinger, November 
, 1920, [place, State],’’ and pin this on the 
breast of the winner. 
Now announce that you have a mysterious bottle that 
never fails to answer questions correctly. The entire group 
forms a circle. One person stands in the center with a 
bottle, which is one of the long-necked kind. A large grape 
juice bottle will be just the thing. A Coca-Cola bottle will 
do. The person in the center asks the bottle a question, 
such as ‘‘Who is most deeply in love in this crowd?’’ or 
‘*Who has received the most proposals?’’ or ‘‘Who has the 
biggest ears?’’ He then spins the bottle on its side. The 
one to whom it points when it stops indicates its answer. 
This person now exchanges places with the person in the 
center, and the game continues as long as desired. 
Now try pinning the head on a turkey. Have a large 
picture of the Thanksgiving bird, minus the head, pinned 
on a sheet or curtain. Give each one a chance to pin the 
head in proper place after being blindfolded. 
Feather Football.—_Now let the players divide into two 
sides and gather at opposite ends of a large table. In 
the center of the table is a downy feather. Players on both 
sides blow against one another in trying to get the feather 
over the opponent’s goal. They may creep up as far as 
the middle of the table, but no farther. Should the feather 
go out of bounds—that is, off one side or the other—it is 
put in play out from the point where it went outside. 
Serve fruit salad and wafers.

door. 
Pinerm ScrAMBLE 
When the guests have arrived pass out sets of letters 
to each one, seven letters in a set. The letters in each set 
will all be the same. Thus there will be seven P’s in a set, 
or seven I’s, ete. One letter, known only to the chairman 
or to the committee, will be your key letter. For instance, 
you select ‘‘G’’ as your key letter. Then you would have 
only one set of this letter. Of the others you would have 
as many sets as are required to supply your crowd, there 
being several of each, at least. As soon as all the sets are 
distributed a general scramble ensues, in which the players 
exchange letters with a view to getting the letters which 
will spell ‘‘Pilgrim.’’ As soon as a player has the neces- 
sary letters he reports to the chairman. It will be possible 
for only seven players to accomplish this, since only seven 
Q@’s are available. Each of the seven lucky ones may be 
awarded some sort of prize, such as a chrysanthemum, toy 
turkey, and the like. 
THANKSGIVING MENU 
Pass out papers and pencils and let the players work 
on the following menu: 
1. Soup.—Imitation reptile, or what the slangy boy 
carries on his shoulders for a head. 
2. Fish—‘‘ Collect on delivery,’’ or a good thing from

Pirerm Pictures 
Make a huge frame. Stand this out from the wall some 
distance, say ten feet, with long sticks running back on 
either side from the top of the frame to the wall, thus 
holding the frame in place. These sticks also serve as a 
framework for the top and side covering. Cover the front 
of the frame with mosquito netting and the sides and top 
with dark blankets. Arrange a light in this inclosure so 
that it will shine on the poser. Have the frame curtained, 
letting pages in costume pull the curtain aside when the 
picture is ready. All light should be turned off except the 
light in the inclosure. If the instructions are followed as 
outlined, the tableaux will be very effective. 
The following pictures and songs may be given: 
1. The Pilgrim.—Have some one sing one verse of ‘‘Faith

2. The First American—Some one in Indian costume 
who stands peering into the distance, one hand shading 
his eyes. 
Song.—Have some one sing as a solo ‘‘By the Waters of 
Minnetonka,’’ by Lieurance, or ‘‘The Land of the Sky- 
Blue Water,’’ by Cadman.

cheesecloth, or a borrowed tarpaulin. Sprinkle the floor 
with tinsel. Festoon the room with white. Make a snow 
man by covering two bushel baskets with white. Make 
head by stuffing an old pillowcase, marking with ink eyes, 
nose, and mouth, and placing an old pipe in the mouth. 
Make this snow man as realistic as possible and place him 
in a conspicuous position. Stuff inexpensive presents in 
around his neck, tying them to white and red strings that 
Shall hang outside. The white strings shall be for the girls, 
the red for the boys. After the ice-guessing contest have 
each girl and each boy visit the snow man to get a present. 
The first feature of the evening’s fun will be an ‘‘Icicle 
Game.’’ Have a wire stretched across the room. Tie sticks 
of candy on it. Blindfold the young people as they arrive, 
hand each a pair of scissors, and let them attempt to clip 
an ‘‘icicle.’? Participants are not allowed to feel around 
for the wire, but must clip wherever they. stop. 
Divide the crowd into two sides for the snowball-throw-

a hat slips on which are written either ‘‘White’’ or ‘‘Gold.”’ 
Captains are appointed for the two teams, and they line up 
for the contest. A target is provided by tacking a sheet on 
the wall. In the center is a black piece of cheesecloth 
about one foot in diameter. Contestants stand at a dis- 
tance of something like fifteen feet and toss a tennis ball, 
which has been dipped in a plate of flour, at the target. 
Every hit in the black center counts a point, the sides tak- 
ing turn in throwing. 
Announce now that you are to have a snowstorm. In 
the beginning of the evening you have given to each girl a 
small circular piece of white paper on which was written 
a number. This, you told her, was her ‘‘snowflake,’’ and 
that she would need it later in the evening. You didn’t 
explain further. Following your announcement of the 
““snowstorm,’’ some one goes to the balcony or stands on a 
chair and calls all the young men to gather beneath him. 
He has a handful of ‘‘snowflakes,’’ duplicates of the ones 
given out to the girls. Each man is instructed to get 
a snowflake as they descend. He then searches for the 
girl with the duplicate number, and she becomes his ‘‘snow- 
flake’’ for the rest of the evening’s fun. 
Each young man and his ‘‘snowflake’? now work to- 
gether on an ice-guessing contest. It is represented in 
words that end in ‘‘ice’’ or ‘‘ise’’: 
The ice of inducement. Entice. 
The fussy ice. Precise. 
The ice most feared by womankind. Mice. 
The ice of games. Dice. 
The ice that should satisfy. Suffice. 
The ice of religious worship. Sacrifice.

Immediately on the completion of this contest announce 
that the next event will be a ‘‘Frost.’’ Invite about six 
couples to go out of the room. Explain to the rest of the 
crowd the nature of the ‘‘frost’’ and then call in one of 
the persons sent out of the room. A chair has been ar- 
ranged. A boy is brought in and directed to the chair, 
behind which stands a pretty girl. He is then blind- 
folded. A young man, previously selected, steps noise- 
lessly over from the crowd and kisses the blindfolded vic- 
tim lightly on the cheek, dropping immediately back into 
the crowd. The blindfold is taken off, and the young man 
looks around to see the pretty girl still standing behind 
the chair. He is invited to take his place with the crowd. 
A young lady is brought in, A young man stands behind 
the chair, and a young lady steps over from the crowd and 
perpetrates the ‘‘frost.’’ Screams of laughter greet this 
performance. 
Refreshments.—Ice cream and frosted cake. Pop corn 
balls may also be used. 
It would be lots of fun to give this social in the spring 
or summer for the novelty of the thing. In that case 
thermometers imbedded in ice should be placed in conspicu- 
ous positions, and the strings about the snow man’s neck, 
instead of having presents, would have fortunes tied to 
them.

CHRISTMAS SNOWBALLS 
Divide your crowd into two sides. Line the players up 
and give a basket decorated with holly and ribbon to the 
leader of each group. Place on the floor before each line 
a row of five cotton snowballs. The race is now to be run 
after the fashion of a potato race. The first person picks 
up the snowballs, puts them in the basket, and returns 
to deliver the basket to the next in line. This person now 
replaces the snowballs on the floor in proper place. And 
So on it goes until every player has run the course. 
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR THAT CHRISTMAS 
\ PARTY 
Christmas Decorations.—Tastefully decorate with holly, 
mistletoe, and red and green crépe paper. Of course you 
will want a Christmas tree to give the finished effect. 
Christmas Presents—Write the names of all the members 
of the Club on slips of paper. A week or so before 
the party have each one draw a name. Boys’ and girls’ 
names may be kept separate if you desire. The drawer is 
supposed to bring a present to the party for the person 
whose name appears on his slip. No present shall cost 
more than ten cents. The giver may exercise his ingenuity 
in wrapping the present as well as in addressing it. The 
packages are all turned in on arrival and later in the 
evening Santa Claus distributes them. All packages must 
be opened in full view of the crowd. A few extra packages 
should be on hand for persons who may not be members 
of the Club and whose names therefore may not have 
been handed in. The opening of the packages should 
occasion a bit of merriment. 
Christmas Bells—Give each guest on arrival ten tiny
-P-A-G-E-152

red paper bells. During the evening any time he can get 
some one to answer him with a ‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No’’ he collects 
a bell from them, and any time he is forgetful and is tricked 
into answering ‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No’’ he must surrender a bell 
to the person who has caught him. At the close of the 
time allotted for this game some prize is awarded to the 
person having the largest number of bells in his possession. 
A variation of this plan is to allow this feature to extend 
through the entire evening. 
Christmas Pantomimes.—Divide your crowd into three 
groups, the Jingles, the Bells, and the Santas. This may 
be done by having them line up and count off by threes, 
thus: ‘‘One, two, three; one, two, three.’’ All the ones 
would form one group, all the twos another, and all the 
threes the third group. Instruct each group now to plan 
some sort of original Christmas pantomime. Any activity 
or presentation representative of the Christmas season will 
answer. Judges will decide which group presents the best 
pantomime. 
Snowball Fight—Hach of the three groups now select 
ten players to represent them in the Snowball Fight. The 
players sit by teams, nine in each row. The extra player 
assumes a position about ten feet in front of his team and 
midway between the end players. These players are each 
supplied with a large cotton ball. At the signal to start 
the players seated at the left end of each line stand erect 
and the pivot players toss the cotton balls to them. Catch- 
ing the ball the end man rushes to the pivot position 
with it. The former pivot man in the meantime has rushed 
for the opposite end of the line and has seated himself, 
all the players having slid up one. The new pivot man 
turns as soon as he reaches the pivot position and tosses to 
the man who has slid into his position. The ball must 
always be received in an upright position so each player 
as he reaches the chair on the left end immediately arises 
 
-P-A-G-E-153

to receive the toss. The first team to have the original 
pivot man back at that position is winner 
Santa’s Toy Shop.—Assemble all the girls in one room 
and all the boys in another. Whisper to each girl the name 
of some toy. Have some one else at the same time give 
the names of the same list of toys to the boys. When the 
girls are admitted to the toy-shop each boy represents the 
toy given him by some appropriate action or sound. Each 
girl walks about the shop seeking to find the particular 
toy awarded her, taking charge of it as soon as it is located. 
Thus each lady and her ‘‘toy’’ become partners for re- 
freshments.

CHAPTER XIII 
SPECIAL SUMMER PROGRAM SUGGESTIONS 
If I were Recreational Leader for the Summer: 
1. I would take my job seriously. 
2. I would study and make research in the best books 
on socials and games in order to know what to do. 
8. I would ask that a live committee be appointed to 
help me. 
4. I would determine that no affair given under our 
auspices would be a failure for lack of thorough planning. 
5. I would call my committee together and plan for the 
liveliest summer of fun that is possible. 
6. I would promote class and group affairs. 
7. I would cooperate with others in the church and com- 
munity in order to avoid hurtful competition and over- 
lapping. 
8. At the committee meeting I would put in the hands 
of each member of the committee an outline of possibilities 
that would start their tongues to wagging, discussing the 
things we should do. 
9. I would advertise our good times with posters, spe- 
cial invitations, and snappy announcements. What’s the 
use of all our planning if the young people don’t come? 
10. I would pray over my work, for by it I would hope 
to build into our young people Christian attitudes—loyalty, 
enthusiasm, friendliness, cooperation, cheerfulness, and 
fellowship with the Master. 
144
-P-A-G-E-155
  PHUNOLOGY 145 
These would be my ten guide-posts. I would keep them 
constantly before myself and my committee. 
Now I am ready to talk about definite plans. I find 
a world of possibilities, and so I would jot them down for 
my convenience and the convenience of the committee. 
These are: 
1. Parties—Lawn, porch, pavilion, barn. 
2. Pienies—Moonlight, afternoon, all-day. 
8. Excursions—Launch parties, river excursions, rail- 
road to some point of interest, fishing trips, ete. 
4. Summer Camps—Many churches are now promoting 
camps of a week or ten days for their young people. 
5. Athletics—Baseball teams, volleyball, tennis tour- 
naments, field meets, swimming. 
6. Playground Activities—Some of the above. Also cro- 
quet, clock-golf, pig-in-the-hole, horseshoe or quoits tour- 
nament. 
7. Community singing, along with high-class instru- 
mental and vocal selections by the best artists obtainable. 
8. Open-air Dramatics—Pageants, short plays, tableaux, 
pantomimes. 
9. Hikes and hay-rides. 
10. Camp-fires. 
With this list before me I am ready now to outline my 
suggestions of possibilities for each month.

Our committee, after some live discussion, decides what 
features it will promote during the summer. Croquet, 
volley-ball, base-ball, tennis, and horse-shoes are chosen as 
activities that are to run through the entire season. A 
baseball team is to be organized by the boys to play each 
week. A vacant lot near the church is to be cleaned up 
and fitted for a playground. Here tennis, volley-ball, 
croquet, horse-shoe pitching, and playground ball are to be 
played. 
Our next job now is to lay definite plans for the month 
of June. The Flower Lawn Social is discussed and out- 
lined. Or it may be that some of he other suggestions 
for that month are chosen. 
FLOWER LAWN SOCIAL 
Decorations—Japanese lanterns. Plenty of flowers and 
plants. 
1. Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.—All join 
hands, forming large circle around the lawn, and skipping 
to the left as they sing to the tune of ‘‘Here We Go Round 
the Mulberry Bush’’: 
(1) Here we go round the mulberry bush, the mulberry 
bush, the mulberry bush; 
Here we go round the mulberry bush, so early in 
the evening. 
(2) (Skipping to the right.) 
This is the way we clap our hands, we clap our 
hands, we clap our hands;  
-P-A-G-E-157

This is the/way we clap our hands, so early in the 
evening. 
(Piano should, repeat music as all clap in time.) 
(3) (All bow first to partners, and then to persons on 
other side of them as they sing) : 
This is the way we greet our friends, we greet our 
friends, we greet our friends; 
This is the way we greet our friends, so early in 
the evening. 
(4) Skip, repeating verse number one. 
2. Flower Charades.—Divide the crowd into several 
groups and have each group present two or three flower 
charades while the others guess. When the flower is cor- 
rectly guessed the performing group is chased back to a 
given line called the garden wall. All players captured 
become members of the capturing team. Flowers that may 
be used are rose, aster, primrose, Johnny-jump-up, poppy, 
goldenrod, chrysanthemum, marigold, trumpet, balsam, 
elder, sweet William, bachelor’s button, tulips, forget-me. 
not, lady’s slipper, sweet peas, and wandering Jew. 
8. Sunflower Minstrel.__The participants will, of course, 
be in black-face, with stiff, wide, yellow petal collars giving 
the sunflower effect. If yellow cardboard is not available, 
cover the petals with yellow paper or cloth. Or all par- 
ticipants may stick their heads through an opening in a 
long strip of cloth. Around each opening has been fash- 
ioned a large sunflower, by sewing yellow petals on the 
eloth. When the curtain is drawn aside all the sunflowers 
may be feigning sleep. Slowly they open their eyes, then 
roll eyes right, then left, then up, then front. The open- 
ing number should now be sung. ‘‘Where the Morning 
Glories Grow’’ would make a good number. Other good 
song numbers would be ‘‘My Wild Irish Rose,’’ ‘‘Love
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 PHUNOLOGY 
Brings a Little Gift of Roses,’’ ‘‘Remember the Rose,’’ 
“The Last Rose of Summer,’’ ete. Some good jokes, with 
a local flavor, if possible, would intersperse the song num- 
bers. 
4. Refreshments.—Ice cream with rose or other flower 
standing in it. Cakes with icing flowers. 
Fourtx or Juuy Picnic 
Get the whole church to come together for a gala day 
packed with fun and good fellowship. The church will 
be all the better for this one big play day all together. 
Games that can be played are Dodge Ball (Bancroft, 
864), ‘‘Three Deep,’’ ‘‘Jacob and Rachel,’’ ‘‘Three Legged 
Race,’’ ‘‘Spanish Relay,’’ ‘‘Blind Swat,’’ ‘‘Rooster Fight.’’ 
See also other relay races and games in Phunology. Re- 
member it is important to plan your program definitely. 
There ought to be a short patriotic speech and a flag- 
raising exercise. At the flag-raising some good reader 
could give ‘‘Your Flag and My Flag,’’ or Riley’s ‘‘Old 
Glory.’’ 
It would be a good idea also to send up several tissue- 
paper balloons toward dusk. 
Community Srincine 
During the war community singing became a popular 
and effective means for stirring the fires of patriotism, at 
the same time affording a delightful diversion and a helpful 
relaxation from the strain of war conditions. In “‘Y”’ 
huts, in parks, in public buildings, everywhere, soldiers 
and civilians were gathered together to sing. The slogan 
was ‘‘A singing army and a singing people can’t be de- 
feated.’’ 
Community singing has tremendous value also as a peace- 
time recreation. Perhaps you could get together all the
-P-A-G-E-159
  
PHUNOLOGY 149 
churches in your community for an out-door sing once a 
month during the summer. 
A good song leader would be necessary to insure sue- 
cess, and a good pianist also is essential. 
Song sheets could be printed or they may be obtained 
at nominal cost from Community Service, 315 Fourth 
Avenue, New York City. Some fine suggestions are con- 
tained in a booklet entitled ‘‘Community Singing,’’ issued 
by that organization. 
Remember that the most popular songs are the old songs. 
The truth of this statement was attested in a recent vote 
that was taken in various parts of the country by coms 
munity song directors. In the list of eighteen highest were 
“Dixie,’’ ‘‘Old Folks at Home,’ ‘‘America, The Beauti- 
ful,’’ ‘‘Old Kentucky Home,’’ ‘‘Carry Me Back to Old 
Virginny,’’ ‘‘Old Black Joe,’’ ‘‘Sweet Genevieve,’’ and 
other songs. ‘‘There’s a Long, Long Trail,’’ ‘‘L’il Liza 
Jane,’’‘‘Sweet Adeline,’’‘‘Good-night Ladies,’’ and ‘‘ ’Till 
We Meet Again’’ were also in this list of eighteen. 
A singing contest might be arranged between several of 
the churches as a special feature for one evening. 
Another special feature that may be added to your pro- 
gram is to have a pantomime of some such song as ‘‘Rock 
of Ages,’’ or ‘‘Abide With Me,’’ while a quartet sings the 
song. 
Some good special musical numbers should feature every 
program. 
Oren Air Brste Dramatic EveNING 
This would arouse a great deal of interest and would 
afford an evening both pleasant and profitable. It might 
be necessary to construct a platform for the presentations. 
Tableaux and pantomimes could be presented. Some 
effective tableaux could be worked out on the following
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 PHUNOLOGY 
themes: The Christ-child in the Manger, The Shepherds, 
The Wise Men following the Star, The Child Moses in the 
Bull-rushes. 
Appropriate songs should be sung or played during these 
tableaux. 
Biste Piays 
For plays running a whole evening ‘‘Ruth,’’ ‘‘Esther,’’ 
“The Children of Israel,’’ or some other three-act play 
could be used. A shorter play would give a chance for 
greater variety in the program, however. Valuable sug- 
gestions could be found in ‘‘Dramatized Bible Stories for 
Young People,’’ by Russell, or ‘‘Bible Plays,’’ by Rita 
Benton. 
GaMEsS 
If desired and practical a few games could be played. 
1. Bible Characters—Pin names of Bible characters on 
the backs of the guests. They must discover whom they 
represent by the remarks that others make to and about 
them. As soon as a player discovers his identity he reports 
to the committee and receives some award. 
2. Living Alphabet.—See ‘‘ Animate Alphabet’’ in Chap- 
ter XVI, in ‘‘Phunology.’’ Call out Bible names to be 
spelled. Type—‘‘The name of Abraham’s wife. The first 
side to spell ‘‘Sarah’’ wins a point. 
MOONLIGHT PICNIC 
The invitations are written on half-moons and read: 
Moonlight night! 
Moonlight bright! 
Picnic? Right! 
Fun? A sight! 
We meet at the church at 7 P.M. and go in a body to Centennial Park. 
It would add much to the enjoyment of the picnic to
-P-A-G-E-161
  PHUNOLOGY 151 
have a committee precede the crowd by an hour or so in 
order to put up a number of Japanese lanterns. This 
would give a festive appearance that would do much to 
put everybody in the right mood for a big time. Some 
of the games you can play follow: 
\Seurren is THE TREE 
Have the crowd divide into groups of three each. These 
groups stand about promiscuously. Two of them take hold 
of hands and form the tree. The third stands between 
them inside the tree thus formed. Several lost squirrels 
will be without homes and will stand wherever they desire. 
The leader blows a whistle and every squirrel must leave 
its tree immediately to find another. In the general 
scramble that follows the homeless squirrels try to dodge 
into a tree. The chances are that several new squirrels 
will be without homes. The whistle is blown again and 
there is another wild scramble. The leader should keep 
the game moving at rapid pace. Every player should be 
given a chance to be a squirrel. This can be done by the 
squirrels changing places with the trees. You will find 
this game a good lively mixer. 
Rina 
This old game is always popular. The crowd stands in 
a circle holding a string that runs all the way round. On 
this string is a ring that is passed along from player to 
player. A player inside the circle tries to detect what 
player has the ring. If he tags a player or challenges 
him and the ring is in either of his hands, that player 
becomes ‘‘It,’? in turn. Where there is a large circle, it 
would be well to have several players inside and several 
rings on the string. To deceive ‘‘It’’ all players keep their 
hands moving constantly back and forth on the string. 
a
-P-A-G-E-162

~ Frymve DurcHMaN 
The players stand in a circle by couples. One couple 
stands outside. This couple runs around, much the same 
as in ‘‘Drop the Handkerchief,’’ and finally taps the hands 
of one of the couples in the circle. Immediately this couple 
must run around the circle in opposite direction from the 
couple that is ‘‘It,’’ the idea being to try to get back to 
position before the other couple occupies it. When the 
couples meet they must both bow elaborately, the girls 
courtesying, and the boys going down on one knee. 
Carn Tag 
Players all stand behind a safety line except one who 
is ‘‘It.’’. When ‘‘It’’ commands ‘‘Run,’’ all players must 
cross the danger territory where ‘‘It’’ holds sway to another 
safety goal opposite. Players caught by ‘‘It’’ must join 
hands with him and help catch others. Only outside play- 
ers in the chain are allowed to tag, and if the chain breaks, 
all players caught that time are set free. The game con- 
tinues until every player is caught. It will be necessary 
to determine an outside boundary line. 
CaNnDLE RACE 
The crowd should be divided into two sides and teams 
should be chosen to represent each side. Six players, for 
instance, might represent each group. The race would be 
run in shuttle style, three players from each team being 
at one end of the course, and three at the other. One 
player on each team would be provided with a candle. At 
the signal to go he lights his candle, or another player 
lights it for him. He must now run to the opposite end 
of the course and hand the lighted candle to one of his 
team-mates there. This player starts immediately for the
-P-A-G-E-163
  
PHUNOLOGY 153 
starting point and delivers it to another team-mate. The 
first team to finish, all six players having run, wins the 
race. If the candle should go out, the player carrying it 
must go back, get it lighted, and start over. 
Sones 
Most everybody enjoys singing. Lead the crowd in 
singing some of the old favorites that will never die: ‘‘My 
Old Kentucky Home,”’ ‘‘The Old Folks At Home,’’ ‘‘Carry 
Me Back to Old Virginny,”’ ete. They will also enjoy 
‘‘Long, Long, Trail,’’ ‘‘Till We Meet Again,’’ ‘‘Old Me- 
Donald,’’ ‘‘John Brown’s Baby,’’ ‘‘Sweet Ivory Soap,’’ 
aod some of the better class of popular airs. 
OrHER GAMES 
Other games that may be used are ‘‘Cat and Rat,’’ 
“‘Two-Deep’’ or ‘‘Three-Deep,’’? ‘‘Dumb Crambo,’’ and 
‘‘Jacob and Rachel.’’ : 
MArsHMALLOW Roast 
Have some of the boys make a fire. Each one'will 
provide himself with a long sharp-pointed stick. Marsh- 
mallows should be provided in abundance. ‘These are 
placed on the ends of the sticks and roasted in the flames. 
This will be a fitting close to your evening of fun. 
OUTDOOR BOOK COSTUME PARTY

CosTUMES 
The guests are requested to come representing the name 
of some book, author, play, or song. Each guest is sup- 
posed to have one quotation from the book, author, play, 
or song represented, and must repeat this quotation to anz 
who ask for it. All are provided with cards and pencils 
and make their guesses as to who or what each guest repre- 
sents. A prize may also be awarded for the best costume. 
Some suggestions for costumes: 
““Twice-told Tales,’’ chestnuts sewed all over coat or 
dress; ‘‘Black Beauty,’’ black costume with black mask; 
“Vanity Fair,’’ elaborate dress and constant use of mir- 
ror and make-up; ‘‘Descent of Man,’’ sash swung from 
shoulder with letters ‘‘M-A-N’’ printed one letter below the 
other; ‘‘Water Babies,’’ pictures of small fish sewed on 
dress; ‘‘Christmas Carol,’’ copies of carols sewed on coat 
or dress. Others that’ will be easy are ‘‘The Princess,’’ 
“The Lamplighter,’’? ‘‘Old Black Joe,’ ‘‘If Winter 
Comes,’’ ‘‘Seventeen,’’ ‘‘The Three Musketeers,’’ ‘‘Long- 
fellow,’’ and ‘‘Lightnin’.’’ 
CanDLE ACQUAINTANCE 
Each one is now given a candle and a slip of paper 
on which is written the name of some familiar song. At 
the signal from the leader all candles are lighted, the names 
of the songs read, and each person begins to sing his song, 
hunting for the other person in the crowd singing the 
same song. These two become partners. You can imagine 
the uproar with all the guests singing at the same time, 
and singing different songs. It isn’t at all harmonious, 
but it breaks down all stiffness and it’s lots of fun. 
CHARADES 
Divide the crowd into two sides and let them put on 
charades representing the name of books, authors, plays, 
   
-P-A-G-E-165
PHUNOLOGY 155 
or songs. The guessing group must be told which one of 
these is being represented. 
PaNTOMIME 
‘‘Hiawatha’’ or some other such literary gem could be 
pantomimed as some one reads it. 
Two Writine Stunts 
a. Give ten minutes for guests to write down all the 
celebrated heroines of fiction they can recall. Award prizes 
for largest list. 
b. Give out sheets of paper or tiny home-made books 
with the names of celebrated heroines written out. Let 
players identify them by writing opposite each name the 
title of the book in which her story is told. 
FIELD MEET 
This should be a big affair between the various churches 
or schools of the community. Or it might be a combination 
meet for several small towns. 
Plenty of advertising should be done, and arrangements 
made far enough in advance to allow the churches time 
to make adequate preparation. 
Competent officials should be chosen to handle the Meet. 
There should be a Registration Committee, and it should 
be required that the names of all entrants be in their 
hands by a certain date. You will also need Judges, 
Announcers (with megaphones), Starter, Clerks-of-Course 
to attend to measurements and to post scores on a large 
black-board, Time-keepers, ete.

This continues until all players have run the course. 
7. Baseball Throwing Contest (for Distance). 
(a) For boys. 
(b) For girls.

9. Ladies’ Nail Driving Contest. 
Each contestant should be furnished a hammer, a block 
of wood, and ten nails. The Judges will decide the winner 
on the basis of speed and skill. 
10. Hobble-Hurdle—tTie each contestant’s ankles to- 
gether. Put obstacles five inches high at several places in 
the course and require that they jump over these as they 
come to them. 
11. Honeymoon Race.—Similar to Costume Race. Young 
man and young woman represent each school. Each couple 
provided with a suit-case in which are all sorts of ridicu- 
lous wearing apparel—kimono, hat, men’s slippers, for the 
girl; and rain-coat, boudoir cap, ete., for the boy. Run 
to given line, take out apparel, don it, rush back to start- 
ing point arm in arm, take off this added apparel, put it 
back in suit-case, and shut and strap it. 
~ 12. Chariot Race-——Toy wagon or wheel-barrow. One 
contestant rides while the other pulls or pushes. Arriving 
at the opposite side of the course, the rider jumps out,
-P-A-G-E-167
  
PHUNOLOGY 157 
his team-mate takes his place, and the race is finished at 
the starting line with the former rider pulling or pushing. 
It may add some to the interest in this race to have a 
girl and a boy on each team. 
13. Centipede or Caterpillar Race.—Five to ten boys 
represent each group. The team straddles a long pole and 
races to a given point and back. 
14. Wheelbarrow Race. (Boys.)—Two boys represent 
each team. One player supports his body with his hands 
while the other holds him by the ankles. In this position 
they race to a given goal. 
In these events you will allow five points for first place, 
three points for second, and one point for third, excepting 
in the ‘‘Tug-of-War,’’ when you will allow ten points for 
first place, five points for second, and nothing for third. 
In the ‘‘Tug-of-War’’ it is a good idea to have two ropes 
available for use so that four teams can pull at once. The 
winners will pull against one another until you have deter- 
mined the champion by a process of elimination. Of the 
last two that pull, one will take first place, and the other 
second. 
Dinner may be served on the grounds and the Meet 
could well end in a big picnic and jollification. 
INDIAN PARTY AND CAMP FIRE 
Lee in his ‘‘Play in Education’? speaks of the ‘‘Big 
Injun”’ age, but after watching a group of young people 
at an Indian party we wondered if the ‘‘Big Injun”’ 
period didn’t run through the entire span of life. Given 
the occasion, a few feathers, and possibly a costume, and 
the ‘‘Big Injun’’ begins to assert himself, even in the old- 
timers.  
-P-A-G-E-168
158 PHUNOLOGY 
And a camp fire! ‘Well, there’s something romantic, 
mysterious, and fascinating about it. Whether your an- 
cestors were at one time fire-worshippers or not, you find 
any kind of a fire a tremendous attraction. Haven’t you 
-ever had the quiet joy of looking into a grate fire and 
‘seeing all sorts of fanciful figures in the licking flames 
and burning embers? My, what you have missed! And 
then there was the thrill of a bon-fire! Wasn’t it great? 
Most any kind of fire brings its thrill. We know people 
who will get up in the middle of the night, dress, and rush 
madly to a fire, when they hear the fire-bells and see the 
sky red from some conflagration that may be a mile or 
80 away. 
Now link up the ‘‘Big Injun’’ and the ‘‘Fire-Worship- 
per’’ and we ought to have some party. 
Select some beautiful flat location for your party and 
have the committee set up a few wigwams for decorative 
purposes. Get enough feathers so that each person can 
have one to wear. An inch strip of brown cambric will 
serve as a head-band. The committee should have these 
on hand. Get some of the boys who know how, to lay your 
camp fire. 
Begin with the following Indian chant, the crowd form- 
ing a big circle around the fire: 
‘‘Wa kon da de du, Wa pa din, A-toné 
Wa kon da de du, Wa pa din, A-toné.’’ 
Hands above heads and bend to ground on first line, 
back to first position on second line. 
War DANcE 
Form two concentric circles, braves inside, squaws out- 
side. At signal braves dance one way, and squaws the 
other in characteristic Indian style, yelling as they dance, 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
  
  PHUNOLOGY 159 
When the whistle blows all dancing stops and each squaw 
grabs a brave. They talk for just a few seconds when the 
whistle blows again. This is the signal for them to start 
the dance again. A few minutes of this will break up 
any stiffness and get the crowd in a good mood for an 
evening of fun. 
“JACK’s ALIVE’’ 
Crowd is seated in one big circle. Five or six corks 
on long sticks have been placed in the fire. When they 
have started to blaze get several helpers to start them 
around the cirele. As each person handles them he blows 
on the cork. If the cork shows a spark of red he says, 
“‘Humph, Jack heap much alive!’’ and passes it immedi- 
ately to the person to his right. This person goes through 
the same performance, and so it goes around the circle. 
If a player fails to get a spark, Jack is ‘‘heap much dead’’ 
and that player must submit to having a mustache, or nose 
or cheek decoration made on his face by his left-hand 
neighbor with the burnt cork. All players must enter into 
the spirit of the game. 
An Invian Story 
Have the best story-teller you can get tell some Indian 
legend. It must not be too long.

This is the familiar All-up relay, using Indian clubs.

stradled, another straight position with arms on side. Con- 
testants must go over first two, under arms of third between 
legs of four, around fifth man, and back same way. 
  
HORSESHOES OR QUOITS 
The regulation distance between pegs in horse shoes is 
3814 feet. For girls, this distance will have to be short- 
ened considerably. 
The regulation distance for quoits is 30 feet, for senior 
competition. For the playground this distance may be 
shortened to 20 feet. 
HAY-RIDE AND WATERMELON FESTIVAL 
Luscious watermelon and a jolly hay-ride—put these 
two together and you have a big joyous good time. Ride 
out into the country or to a park, play a few rollicking 
games, pull off a few stunts, and wind up with a big 
watermelon feed. 
As a special feature have a watermelon eating contest, 
making the contestants hold their hands behind them while 
they eat. 
Another special feature could be a Melon Artists’ Con- 
test. Each guest, using a pen-knife or other available 
implement, makes an animal, face, or figure, on his water- 
melon rind. <A prize may be given for the cleverest crea- 
tion. 
  
TENNIS TOURNAMENT 
This may be the grand climax of a season of playing. 
“The schedule of contests should be carefully worked out 
so as to determine the champions in singles and doubles. 
Medals or badges may be awarded the winners.

CAMERA HIKE 
*¢You will like 
The Camera Hike.’’ 
With this slogan you advertise the hike, asking all those 
who have cameras to bring them along. Pick out a route 
with many picturesque spots along the way. Let the 
hikers stop occasionally to take snap-shots. Let it be un- 
derstood that prizes are to be offered for the best. The 
committee will divide the pictures into two classes—pictures 
of nature scenes (landscapes, birds, animals) and pictures 
of persons. In each of these two classes there will be 
awards for: (1) The most artistic, (2) The most unique, 
(3) The most humorous. 
All pictures when finished shall be turned in to the 
committee. It will mount them on cardboard, make its 
decision, and arrange them artistically around the room 
for the Camera Party which will follow after the hike by 
several weeks. Or it may number all pictures and have 
the crowd vote on the best in the several classes. 
Guests at the Camera Party may be asked to turn into 
the committee baby pictures of themselves. These also 
should be numbered and guesses made as to the originals 
of these pictures. 
The old Art Gallery guessing game could also be used. 
Slides could be made of some of the best of the Hike 
pictures and they could be thrown on the screen. 
  
QUOITS OR HORSESHOE TOURNAMENT 
Like the Tennis Tournament this might be the climax 
of a season of playing. Quite a good bit of interest could 
be aroused during the summer in this healthful sport 
by providing equipment and encouraging every one, includ-
-P-A-G-E-172

ing the girls, to participate. The tournament should be 
well advertised, judges and scorers carefully selected, and 
all other details carefully planned. Ice-cold lemonade 
might be served to spectators and contestants. 
  
TRIP AROUND THE WORLD 
Tickets may be given out or sold bearing the following 
instructions : 
“WORLD TOUR. Ship leaves the landing at Carson’s 
Lawn, corner Peabody and Dudley Streets, promptly at 
ta) P.M.” 
Uncle Sam and Miss Columbia greet the guests as they 
arrive at Carson’s Lawn. When the crowd has assembled 
it is led in the singing of ‘‘The Star Spangled Banner’”’ 
or ‘‘America.”’ 
Promptly at 7:45, or such time as has been agreed, they 
depart in automobiles for the home of another member. 
This is evidently Mexico for there are brilliantly costumed 
Mexican belles on the lawn, and Mexican men with bright- 
colored sashes around their waists and large sombreros 
on their heads. One of the girls plays ‘‘La Paloma’’ as 
a violin solo. Mexican chili is served from a pretty booth 
in the center of the lawn by attendants in Mexican costume. 
Then, in turn, the touring party visits Scotland, Holland, 
Japan, and China. Each place is decorated appropriately, 
Japanese lanterns, perhaps, playing an important part 
everywhere. Attendants are garbed in the costumes of the 
particular countries represented. The program and refresh- 
ments should also be in keeping. Brief suggestions follow: 
Scotland.—Solo or Quartet, ‘‘Annie Laurie’’; all sing 
‘“My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean’’; refreshments, oat- 
meal cakes.
-P-A-G-E-173
  PHUNOLOGY 168 
Holland.—National flag; ‘‘Windmill Stunt,’’ three or 
four orators make speeches, all talking at the same time; 
refreshments, cheese sandwiches. 
Japan.—National flag, numerous open Japanese parasols 
suspended over lawn, Japanese lanterns; ‘‘Fan Ball’’ 
(see Phunology, page 187) ; refreshments, cherry ice. 
China.—National flag, numerous dragon panels or cur- 
tains about the lawn; ‘‘Chinese Hop’’ (see Phunology, 
page 164); refreshments, rice cakes and tea. 
If the committee desires, it can make this a missionary 
tour, having large display charts at each place containing 
facts of interest. 
  
RACES AND GAMES FOR PICNIC AND PARTY 
A Wireless Race.—The players line up single file in two 
or more lines. There is a receiver or judge for each line, 
who stands on a mark several feet from the head player. 
A sealed message is given to this player in each line, and 
the judges also are provided with copies. At the signal 
to start the seal is broken and the message is read by 
the player who holds it. He hurriedly whispers it to the 
next player in line. This player turns immediately and 
whispers it to the next, and thus it goes until the message 
has reached the end player. As soon as he gets it he 
rushes to the receiver for his line and whispers the message 
to him. The receiver or judge compares the message re- 
ceived with the ecpy he has. Accuracy as well as speed 
counts. If two teams tie in accuracy, the race will be 
decided in favor of the team delivering the message first. 
Accuracy counts for more than speed, however, and should 
only one team deliver the message accurately it shall be 
declared the winner, even though it may be the last in 
making the delivery. The message should be the same for 
each team.

164 PHUNOLOGY 
Bunny Race.—The runners must assume a stooped po- 
sition with hands raised bunny fashion. In this position 
they must make their way to the finish line in short jumps. 
“Blind Men’s Race.—Blindfold the runners and lead them 
to their positions at the starting point. The runners may 
have some trouble getting to the finishing line, but that’s 
where the fun comes in. 
“Chariot or Triangle Race.—Three runners represent each 
group. They stand with backs to one another and with 
hands clasped, forming a triangle. In this position they 
race to a mark and back. 
~ Centipede or Caterpillar Race——Two or more teams of 
boys, equal in number, straddle long poles and race to a 
given point and back. The more boys you can get on the 
pole the more fun will the race provide. 
Crab Race.—The runners go down on all fours and race 
backwards. 
Chinese Hop Race.—This race is a test of skill as well as 
of speed. Ten sticks are laid down for each contestant 
at such distances as to easily allow a foot to be placed 
between them. The runner must hop over all the sticks, 
stoop and pick up the last stick without touching his 
raised foot to the ground, and then hop back over the 
rest of the sticks. He drops stick No. 10 to the ground 
and goes back for stick No. 9. This he continues until all the 
sticks have been taken up. If at any time he touches a 
stick with his foot he must start the race all over again 
after putting all the sticks back in position. The same 
penalty may be imposed for touching the raised foot to 
the ground, though in the case of inexperienced players 
it may be allowable to touch the foot to the ground before 
each start. This race may also be run as a relay, with 
ten runners for each side. In this case the starting line 
would be about six feet from the first stick. 
Dizzy Izzy.—This race is one of the most amusing of all 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
PHUNOLOGY 165 
races. Hach contestant is furnished with a stick or cane 
about as long as the ordinary umbrella. Placing the end 
of the stick firmly to the ground, he must put both hands 
on the top and rest his head on his hands. Then with 
eyes open he must go around the stick four times without 
lifting it from the ground or taking his head from the 
position first taken. In the case of younger boys, it may 
be advisable to require that they turn around as many 
as seven times. After making the required number of 
turns, the runner must race to and around a tree, pole, 
chair, or whatever has been designated, and return to the 
starting point. This race is exceptionally effective as a 
relay. In this case the two teams would line up single 
file behind the starting line, and each man, in turn, would 
begin his turning around the stick as his team-mate re- 
turns and hands it to him. It would be well to have a 
starter for each stick to count the turns for each runner 
so that no contestant shall unwittingly take advantage of 
his opponents by not making the required number. 
“\Duck or Ankle Race-——Each runner must take hold of 
his ankles, and holding this position, race to the finish line. 
‘Dog Race.—The contestants must race forward on all 
fours, galloping dog-fashion. 
Derby Jig.—The contestants must stoop and clasp hands 
around their knees. In this position they must race to 
the goal. 
Horse Race-—Two boys for each team. They race to a 
given point, each boy mounted on his team-mate’s back. At 
the goal line the rider dismounts and he becomes the horse. 
Thus the return is made. 
“AS YOU WERE!” 
Here is a good mixing game that will probably thaw 
out your crowd if the commands are given snappily.
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 PHUNOLOGY 
Have the girls and boys line up single file in different 
rooms. Let them now march out into the main room, the 
two lines meeting and thus matching partners. The part- 
ners now form a circle, boys on the outside. (A simple 
expedient for a crowd where the boys and girls are not 
present in equal numbers is the use of a white handker- 
chief tied about the arm to make the proper balance. Thus 
a girl with a white handkerchief around her arm becomes 
a boy for the purposes of the game.) 
The leader now takes the center of the circle and calls 
the command, ‘‘March!’’ The couples circle about him. 
Next he shouts, ‘‘Girls outside, boys inside!’’ Then, ‘‘Girls 
in front of boys!’’ Then, ‘‘Halt, and face partners!’’ 
Then, ‘‘The grand right and left!’’ In this the couples 
clasp right hands and pass to each other’s right. Then 
with the next partner they clasp left hands and pass to 
the left. They continue to alternate in this way, thus 
winding in and out, the girls going in one direction and 
the boys in the other, until the leader shouts, ‘‘As you 
were!’’ when each person must find his first partner and 
assume the first position of the game. In this scramble 
the leader endeavors to get a partner. The player left 
out is ‘‘It.”’ 
In a large crowd two leaders may be used, one being a 
boy and the other a girl. 
[Nore.—If the players have never before tried the grand right 
and left, it would be best to explain it clearly before the game starts, 
staging a demonstration with a few players.] 
“VyuNtT THE SLIPPER 
Players form in a circle with one player, who is ‘‘It,’’ 
in the center. All players face center with hands behind 
them. Some one in the circle has a slipper in his hands,
-P-A-G-E-177
  PHUNOLOGY 167 
which he passes to one of his neighbors. At any time he 
desires, ‘‘It’’ may challenge any player to show both hands. 
If the slipper happens to be in the called player’s posses- 
sion he becomes ‘‘It’’ in turn, and the game continues. 
It is allowable for any player to hit ‘‘It’’ in the back with 
the slipper. The slipper is then tossed back to some player 
in the circle, and after ‘‘It’’? counts ten the game is on 
again. 
  
\ STATUE RACE 
Contestants line up at one side of the room. A leader 
stands in front of them. When he turns his back and 
walks from them they may walk, not run, as rapidly as 
it is possible. Immediately he whirls about facing them 
they must stop, holding the position in which they 
happen to be at the moment. Players not observing this 
rule must go back to the starting point and begin all over. 
To make the game interesting the leader must turn at the 
most unexpected moments. This he continues to do until 
the winner of the race has crossed the line. 
  
SHOPPING 
Here’s a game that can be used either indoors or out- 
doors with good results. Group the players by couples 
around four tables. Let one of the tables be decorated 
with a sign that reads ‘‘Dry goods,’’ another ‘‘Drugs,’’ 
another ‘‘Groceries,’’ and the fourth ‘‘Books and Station- 
ery.’’ On each table have a pile of letters turned face 
down. One player at a time at each table turns up a 
letter, and the first player at that table to call out some 
article that may be bought in this particular shop gets 
the letter. Thus some one at the ‘‘Dry goods’’ table turns
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 PHUNOLOGY 
up the letter ‘‘C,’’ and immediately some player calls out 
““Calico.’? At the end of the agreed time the shoppers all 
move to another table in such order that each group will 
make the round of shops. At the close of the shopping 
round the couple with the largest number of letters may 
be awarded some sort of prize. This game may be played 
in progressive fashion. In this case the high couple at 
each table would move up to another table. 
  
JUMP THE SHOT 
The players form a big circle with one player in the 
center. This player has a long heavy string, on the end 
of which is tied a bean bag or a small bag of sand. A 
long fishing pole would serve even better. He whirls 
this around close to the ground, and the players in 
the circle must avoid being hit by jumping over it as it 
reaches them. When a player is hit he must immediately 
drop out of the circle. The last player in the circle may 
be center man for the next game. 
  
POOR LITTLE PUSSY CAT (SIDES) 
Line up the players in two sides facing one another. 
Side No. 1 sends its first player over to the first player on 
Side No. 2. He must kneel before No. 2 and say ‘‘Meow’’ 
three times. Each time No. 2 must pat him on the head 
and say solemnly: ‘‘Poor little pussy cat.’’ If No. 2 
should smile or laugh, he must drop out of line. The next 
player from side No. 2 now goes over and kneels to the 
player on No. 1 who is opposite him, going through the 
same performance. At the close the side with the most 
players in line is declared winner. 
A variation of this plan would be to have all the players 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
PHUNOLOGY 169 
of one side kneel to the other at one time. The other side 
would then take its turn in trying to disturb the solemnity 
of its opponents. 
FISH NET 
The players form in two lines. Boundary lines are de- 
termined so that the distance between the safety goals is 
about the width of a ordinary gymnasium. For thirty 
players the length of the field would be just about the 
length of a gymnasium. For a larger group the field would 
have to be lengthened. One group of players stands be- 
hind the safety goal on one side. The other group stands 
in the middle of the space between the two lines, all 
players clasping hands. Its captain shouts ‘‘Fish net!’’ 
and sweeps toward the safety goal behind which the other 
side stands trying to catch as many players in the net as 
is possible. Only end players can tag an opponent, and 
thus players may escape by dodging around the fish net 
or by ducking under the arms of those forming it, a means 
that the net players may prevent by blocking the runner 
until one of the end players can tag him. When a player 
reaches the safety zone on the other side he is free for 
the time being. Each player caught in the net must drop 
out. If the net is broken by any of the players unclasping 
hands, all fish caught in that sweep are released. After 
five sweeps or such a number as may be decided by mutual 
agreement, the sides change places. The side catching the 
most fish is declared winner. 
SPELL-DOWN 
The group is divided into two equal sides which face 
one another. The game may be played in two ways: 
1. The head player on one side begins a word giving
-P-A-G-E-180
    170 PHUNOLOGY 
the first letter. The opposite player on the other side 
adds a letter. Then it goes back to the second player on 
the first side, and so on until somebody finishes a word. 
If a word is finished the player is out. For instance the 
first player says ‘‘S.’? The opposite player immediately 
says ‘‘O,’’ and is out for finishing the word ‘‘so.’’ It 
makes no difference what word the player has in mind. 
If he finishes a word he is out. 
If a player doubts that his opponent is really spelling 
a word and it is his time to add a letter, he may challenge 
by saying ‘‘I challenge you.’’ The player must then tell 
what word he has in mind. If he cannot answer he is out. 
If he does answer correctly, the challenger is out. 
The idea of the game is to see which side can have 
players standing longest. 
2. In this case the players have to spell a word beginning 
with the last letter of the word the opponent has just 
spelled. Thus player No. 1 on the ‘‘Blues’’ spells ‘‘thread.’’ 
Number 1 on the ‘‘Reds’’ immediately begins with 
**drone.’’ The next player on the ‘‘Blues’’ begins a word 
with ‘‘H,’’ and so on. No repetitions are allowed, and a 
player must spell his word before the referee can count 
*‘ten.’’? A player counted out, drops out of line.

hind them, reaching out the right hand on being intro- 
duced. They may be dressed in all sorts of ridiculous 
costumes, using kimonos, bathrobes, shawls, ete. 
Serve ‘‘eats’’ in picnic style. 
  
BEAN SOCIAL 
Hand out cards on which are written invitations some- 
thing like the following: ‘‘Have you ever been to a bean 
social? Come out Friday evening, eight o’clock, and “see
-P-A-G-E-184
  174 PHUNOLOGY 
the popular (?) army food featured in an evening’s pro- 
gram of fun.’’ 
BEAN GUESS 
Have a glass jar filled with beans. Let each one make a 
guess as to the number. 
Bran Quiz 
Give each ten beans with instructions as to how to pro- 
eeed. When one is tripped into answering some questions 
by ‘‘Yes”’ or ‘‘No,”’ either in ordinary conversation or by 
eatch questions, he surrenders a bean. This contest may 
run through the whole evening, and at the close the one 
with the largest number of beans is declared winner. 
Bran Stunts 
Give out slips on which are written ‘‘Navy,’’ ‘‘Pole,’’ 
*‘Lima,’’ and ‘‘String.’’? Have an equal number of each. 
Teil the players now to find all those with the same name 
they have on their slips. No announcements are allowed, 
such as ‘‘All Strings gather over in this corner.’’? Each 
player finds some one else of his group. They join hands 
and seek somebody else and so on till the entire group has 
finally gathered, all holding hands. As soon as all four 
groups are gathered they unclasp hands, and each group 
prepares a stunt. Allow anywhere from fifteen minutes 
to half an hour for this preparation. Give a sack of jelly 
bean candy to the group that puts on the best stunt. This 
is to be decided by three persons who have been appointed 
judges. 
Brean Baa RELAY 
Have each group represented by a team of anywhere 
from five to ten players. All players are seated, except
-P-A-G-E-185
  
PHUNOLOGY 175 
one for each team. This person stands a few feet in front 
of his row and midway between the end men of the row, 
the teams being lined up in four rows. At the word ‘‘Go’’ 
No. 1 in each row stands, and the middleman tosses the 
bean bag to him. He returns it by tossing and sits down. 
As soon as he sits down his team-mate, No. 2, can arise, 
and the middleman then tosses to him. And so on it goes 
down the line. When the last player in the line has re- 
ceived and returned the bean bag, the middleman drops it 
on a table or the floor and runs to the last seat, the players 
move up one, and No. 1 takes the middleman’s place as 
tosser. So it continues until the original middleman has 
come back to that position, when he must shout the name 
of his team, ‘‘Navy,’’ ‘‘Pole,’’ ete. The first team finish- 
ing up, of course, is declared victor. Again jelly beans 
may serve as awards 
WW Bean Laer 
Let each group select a team of five players to represent 
them in a bean-lifting contest. Have contestants sit 
around a large table, each having in front of him a saucer 
containing ten beans. Each is provided with two round 
toothpicks. Without wetting the toothpicks, he must lift 
the beans out of the saucer and place them on the table in 
front of him. A starter stands at the head of the table and 
shouts, ‘‘Hands up!’’ when all players must hold tooth- 
picks high in the air. Then, ‘‘One, two, three,’’ and on 
*“three’’ all toothpicks are lowered, and the contest is on. 
When one player has lifted as many as five beans from 
his saucer and placed them on the table, he shouts 
“‘Beans!’’ Immediately all players must stop. All beans 
on the table are then counted, and each team is credited 
with the total number of beans on the table before its 
representatives. After ten trials the total score for each 
team is announced and the winner declared the champion
-P-A-G-E-186
    176 PHUNOLOGY 
bean-lifting team. You might crown the victors with 
wreaths made by tying long string beans together. 
Mess Cauu 
Everybody who served in the army will readily get the 
significance of having a bugler blow the army mess call 
just before you serve ‘‘chow.’’ It would be lots of fun to 
serve a small portion of baked beans and brown bread to 
each one, with a slice of pickle on each plate. Follow this 
with ice cream and cake. Make every one line up, get 
his own plate, spoon, ete., and pass by a table where efficient 
“‘K, P.’s’’ serve out the portions of beans, bread, ete. A 
second round will have to be made for ice cream if objec- 
tion is made to serving it at the same time with the beans. 
Jelly beans might be an additional feature of refresh- 
ments. 
Sones 
Bean songs were popular in the army, and it would be 
jolly good fun to have some of the soldier boys teach the 
crowd to sing some of these songs. Here is one that would 
go well in quartet: 
Tune: ‘‘Pray for Sunshine, but Always Be Prepared 
for Rain.’’ 
Pray for beefsteak, 
But always be prepared for beans; 
Pull up the slack that’s in your belt, 
That old army chow will always take care of itself. 
Keep on smiling; 
Link your smiles up to some golden dreams. 
Beans for supper, beans for dinner, 
Beans in summer, beans in winter, 
Pray for beefsteak, 
But always be prepared for beans—or anything. 
Another ‘‘chow’’ song that is popular is ‘‘To-Day Is 
Monday,’’ which appears elsewhere in this book.

BIBLE EVENING SOCIAL 
Why not have a Bible social? Dry? Well, I should say 
not! You might use this social to introduce a Bible study 
class in the Chapter, but it will go even though you are 
not contemplating the organization of such a class. 
Mrxine Game 
Give out two sets of slips. On one set have Bible ques- 
tions, on the other the answers. Number all slips, questions 
and answers being numbered alike. Thus a slip numbered 
1 would have this question: ‘‘Which of the apostles was 
first martyred?’’ The answer would be on slip numbered 
1 in the other set and would say: ‘‘James, brother of 
John, beheaded at Herod’s order (Acts xii. 2).’’ The girls 
may be given the questions and the boys the answers. Let 
them match up for partners. When each has found 
her answer, the questions are all read by the leader, and 
eich couple responds with the answer to its particular 
question. 
BrsLE PIcTURES 
Cut out Bible pictures of all kinds and pin them on the 
wall. Number them and have the players write down on 
slips of paper who or what the pictures represent. 
BrsticaAL ALPHABET 
Have the players sit or stand in a circle, with one player 
standing in the center. This player calls a letter and points 
to some player while he counts slowly. The player pointed 
out must answer with some Biblical proper name before 
ten is counted. If he fails he exchanges places with the 
player in the center, and the game proceeds.

Bipte CHARADES 
Divide your company into two or more groups and have 
them present charades, presenting Bible characters in this 
manner. Let the committee have suggestions ready for 
those needing them. The young people will work out some 
elever things themselves, however. We offer a few sug- 
gestions, though some of them may seem a little far-fetched: 
1. Abel—One of group says ‘‘I can’’ to everything 
suggested by his colleagues. 
2. Jacob (J-cob).—The group forms the letter J, each 
player in the formation holding up the right hand, with 
the index finger crooked. One player comes out with a 
cob pipe in his mouth. 
3. Daniel (Dan-yell).—Entire group indulges in yelling 
practice, using this yell: 
‘“‘Tribe of Dan! Rah! Rah! 
Tribe of Dan! Rah! Rah! 
Tribe of Dan! Rah! Rah!’’ 
4. Solomon (Solo-man)—Have a boy of the group 
render a solo. It may be a serious attempt or a ridiculous 
one. It doesn’t matter. 
5. Isaiah (I-say-yah).—One of the group represents an 
immigrant who answers ‘‘Yah’’ to everything asked him. 
Each time the person asking the question will follow up 
with, ‘‘What did you say?’’ and the invariable answer 
of the immigrant is: ‘‘I say ‘yah.’ ”’ 
6. Aaron (A-run).—Have some one of the group run 
across the floor. 
7. Amos (A-muss).—Have the group engage in a 
terrific row. 
8. Samson (Sam’s son).—Let one boy of the group come 
out leading another by the hand. Some one of the group 
will say, ‘‘ Who is that you have with you, Sam?’’ and the 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  PHUNOLOGY 179 
answer will come back: ‘‘Oh, that’s my boy.’’ If there is 
considerable difference in size between Sam and his son, 
in favor of the son, it may add to the merriment. 
9. Mark.—-One of the group steps up to the blackboard 
and draws a line, then steps back to the group. 
10. Matthew (Math-hue).—The group can discuss the 
difficulty of an examination in higher arithmetic, algebra, 
or geometry—‘‘math,’’ as the schoolboy calls it. Following 
this, several girls will put on this stunt: Let one act as a 
saleslady, the others coming in to match some dress piece. 
The saleslady will show them indigo, dark blue, navy blue, 
ete.—different hues of the same color. 
11. Luke (Look, the way some of our Italian friends 
pronounce it).—Have group come out talking broken 
English, Italian fashion, then suddenly stopping to gaze 
intently upward. Stand in this gazing attitude for a short 
while. 
12. Nehemiah (Knee-he-my-ah).—One of the group 
comes running out, stumbles, and pretends to have injured 
the knee. Next two girls sit down and talk incessantly, 
‘the’? seeming to be the favorite and only topie worth 
discussing. The entire group comes out. One of them 
makes exaggerated claims of ownership, to which the crowd 
answers in mock astonishment: ‘‘Ah!’’ For instance: 
“‘See this crowd. That’s my crowd.’’ ‘‘Ah!’’ comes from 
the group. ‘‘See this Sunday school. It’s my Sunday 
school.’’? And so he may lay claim to the chandelier, to 
pictures on the wall, to the piano, ete. 
Brste Name Contest 
Divide the company into two sides and line up as in a 
spelling match. The leader of one side will begin the 
game by giving the first syllable of the name of some Bible 
character. The leader of the opposing side will complete
-P-A-G-E-190
  180 PHUNOLOGY 
the name, if he can. Should he fail, he must drop out. 
First, one side and then the other proposes a first syllable, 
the contest moving on down the line. At the end of a 
certain number of rounds, depending on the size of your 
crowd, let the players, still standing in line, for each side 
be counted. 
Brie CHaracter ALPHABET 
This is another game that may be used where a writing

AN INDIAN PARTY 
This jolly party may be adapted for indoors or outdoors, 
winter or summer. 
Invitation —Cut out small paper arrows or tomahawks 
and write the invitations on them. 
Decorations.—Use plenty: of foliage, cornstalks, and any- 
thing to get the ‘‘woodsy’’ atmosphere. In one corner put 
up a small wigwam made of blankets, with an electric light 
camp fire in front of it. 
As the guests arrive fasten a band of cloth around the 
head of each one. Let a piece of the cloth, attached to this 
band, hang down the back. Parallel slits every two or 
three inches in this piece are for feather inserts as the 
players win in contests during the evening. One feather 
to stick straight up under the band or in the hair is given 
to each one at the beginning. An abundance of chicken 
and turkey feathers should be on hand. 
Big Game Hunt.—Begin the evening’s fun with a big 
game hunt. The Social Committee has been busy during 
the week cutting out pictures of animals of all sorts from 
newspapers, magazines, ete. These have been hidden about 
the room. All the Indians search diligently for them. The 
one bringing in the most big game gets a feather for his 
headdress. 
Archery Contest—Now both braves and squaws engage 
in an archery contest. Animals have been cut out of card- 
board—hears, lions, deer, buffaloes—leaving an inch at the
-P-A-G-E-192
  182 PHUNOLOGY 
bottom to be bent back as a base, so the animals can stand. 
Each player is given three shots with bow and arrow, a 
feather being awarded for each hit. 
Animal Hunt.—Another sort of animal hunt that may be 
used is to mix the letters in the spelling of various animal 
names and award a feather for the first correct list turned 
in to the committee. A suggestive list follows: 
. Rabe (bear). 
. Bratib (rabbit). 
. Plehnate (elephant). 
Neyha (hyena). 
Fagrife (giraffe). 
Drapeol (leopard). 
Sumtapopopih (hippopotamus). 
Razeb (zebra). 
Loaffub (buffalo). 
10. Gauron-gautno (ourang-outang). SRAMTA SE 
Indian Ambush.—Divide the company into two sides, 
Shawnees and Apaches. Have them seated opposite one 
another. First one side ‘‘plays’’ hide, then the other. 
Players may hide anywhere in the room and behind, on, 
or under anything, no matter what its size. Hach player 
makes up his mind where he will ‘‘play’’ hide. The other 
side then guesses where Indians are hidden, each in turn 
having a guess. ‘‘I guess there is an Indian behind the 
victrola,’’ says No. 1 of the Apaches, for instance. The 
Shawnees hiding there must all ‘‘ ’fess up’’ by standing. 
The next Apache then guesses and so on. Then the Apaches 
‘play’? hide, and the Shawnees guess. Of course you 
understand that no one really hides, but merely makes 
up his mind where he would hide and remains seated. 
After each round the Indians discovered are considered 
prisoners and cannot hide again. Thus the game goes on 
until one side is eliminated by having all its warriors
-P-A-G-E-193
  PHUNOLOGY 18g 
discovered and taken prisoners. No player can change his 
hiding place after the guessing begins. 
Indian Chase.—This is the old game of ‘‘Last Couple 
Up.’’ The Indians stand in couples, a brave and a squaw, 
in a long line behind one Indian, who stands something 
like ten feet in front of them. The Indian calls, ‘‘Squaw 
and brave up,’”’ and the last couple in line must run 
toward the front on either side of the line and try to join 
hands in front of the chaser. The chaser may not start 
until they are in line with him and may not turn his 
head to see where they are coming from. The couples 
may vary their method of approach, coming up close to 
the line or circling far out on either side or one detouring 
and the other keeping in close. If the chaser catches one 
of them before they can clasp hands, the Indian tagged 
becomes chaser, and the former chaser takes the other 
partner for his own and stands at the head of the line, 
which moves back one place. If the couple are not caught, 
they are free. 
Refreshments.—‘‘Laughing water’’ (lemonade) and 
wolf meat (hot ‘‘dog’’ sandwiches). 
ANOTHER INDIAN Party 
Where there happens to be a large crowd, the company 
may be divided into several groups, say the Shawnees, 
Apaches, Cherokees, and Sioux. Have a chief appointed 
for each tribe. Give every one present some Indian name. 
They are to be called by that name all evening, wearing 
the appellation on the coat or waist. There will be Rain- 
in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Eagle Eye, Hiawatha, Minnehaha, 
Uneas, Powhatan, Pocahontas, Fleetfoot, Heap-Much- 
Ugly, ete. 
Let the tribes engage in the ‘‘Big Game Hunt’’ as out- 
Yined for the first party. Award three feathers to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 PHUNOLOGY 
chief of the tribe bringing in the most big game, two 
feathers for the second largest number, and one for third. 
Stick these in the headpiece of the victorious chief. 
Archery Contest.—The same contest that is outlined for 
Party No. 1; but instead of awarding feathers to indi- 
viduals as they score hits, award feathers to the chiefs of 
the tribes finishing with the best scores, three for first, 
two for second, and one for third. 
Braves’ Relay.—Select three or four braves to represent 
each tribe. Put all sorts of obstacles in the race course 
—pans, chairs, books standing on end. These must be run 
around or jumped over, the runner not being allowed to 
touch or move any of them. The course for each tribe 
must be the same. Strings four feet in height are stretched 
across the course, and runners must duck under these. The 
first brave for each tribe has been provided with a toma- 
hawk (cut out of cardboard), and at the signal to ‘‘Go’’ 
each starts down the course and then makes it back to the 
starting point, handing the tomahawk to the second brave, 
who also runs through and back and so on until the entire 
team has made the course and back, the last man handing 
the tomahawk to the chief of his tribe, who immediately 
holds it aloft. If a runner touches any of the obstacles or 
runs into the string, he must go back and begin again. 
The tribal chiefs are awarded feathers according to the 
order in which their teams finish, three for first and so on. 
Squaws’ Relay.—Select four to eight girls from each 
tribe, toeing the starting line. Directly opposite each team 
and at the far end of the room draw a circle about a foot 
and a half in diameter. Inside of each circle set up three 
Indian clubs (tenpins or long-necked bottles will do) in 
triangular position. At a given signal the first squaw for 
each tribe runs to her circle, places the Indian clubs just 
outside the circle in triangular position, and runs back to 
touch off the second runner, who runs as fast as possible 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
PHUNOLOGY 185 
to the cirele and places the Indian clubs back inside the 
circle. And so on it goes, one runner placing them out- 
side, the next inside. Always the Indian clubs must be 
placed in upright position; and should one fall, the runner 
must go back and set it upright. No runner must beat the 
touch-off by crossing the starting line before a team-mate 
has returned and slapped the outstretched hand. Chief- 
tains are awarded feathers according to the order in which 
their teams finish. 
Now let the chieftains count feathers and announce the 
winning tribe. To this tribe some suitable award may be 
made. For instance, each brave and squaw may get a 
small stick of marshmallow corn such as can be bought 
at the confectionery for a penny, or a bag of wampum may 
be given to the chief—a sack with a quantity of candy 
corn kernels in it. Singing popular Indian songs, such 
as ‘‘Indianola,’’ ‘‘Pretty Little Rainbow,’’ and others will 
add something to the pleasure of the evening. ‘‘The Land 
of the Sky-Blue Water’’ would make an appropriate solo. 
JAPANESE SOCIAL 
Decorate with Japanese lanterns, Japanese parasols, fans, 
bamboo, pink tissue paper cherry blossoms and chrysan- 
themums. Write your invitations Japanese fashion, up 
and down instead of across, or write them on fan-shaped 
pieces of cardboard. 
As guests arrive have the committee greet them Japanese 
fashion, bowing very low three times and saying: 
‘‘Konichiwa’’ or ‘‘Kon-ban-wa’’ (Good evening). The 
committee should be dressed in Japanese costume. When 
guests leave, the committee might say ‘‘Sayonara.’’ 
Japanese Quiz.—Get information as to what your de- 
nomination is doing in Japan. Write down questions on 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  186 PHUNOLOGY 
the country, its history, customs, missionary work, ete. 
Give each guest a sheet of paper. Inform them that the 
answers to the question may be obtained from persons 
in the room wearing the numbers of the particular ques- 
tions. It is unfair to obtain the answers from any one 
else. The first person to turn in a complete and correct 
list of answers should be given some suitable award, such 
as a chrysanthemum, for instance. At the close of this 
game have some one read the questions and let the entire 
company reply in concert. This quiz will serve as a novel 
way .of mixing your crowd and at the same time getting 
to them some worth-while information. 
Japanese Game.—Divide the company into two sides. 
Have them face one another some six or eight feet apart. 
The heads of the two lines advance toward one another, 
hands behind them, while a referee counts ‘‘One, two, 
three.’? On ‘‘three’’ both players extend hands toward 
one another. The hands may be extended in one of three 
ways—with fists clenched, like a stone; with palm flat, 
like paper; or with first and second fingers spread, like a 
pair of scissors. If the opponents choose the same way, 
they must try again. If one has the fist clenched and the 
other the palms flat, the latter wins, because paper can 
wrap up a stone; the two fingers spread beats the open 
palm, because scissors cut paper; and the clenched fist 
beats the fingers spread, because a stone can ruin scissors. 
The player who wins may remain standing, the loser sitting 
down. Or the winner can drop back of his line a few feet. 
The contest continues, the next two players advancing and 
matching, and so on until all the players have tried it. 
The side scoring the most winnings is victor. 
Fan Guess—tTo the Japanese the fan is the emblem of 
life. Therefore any introduction of the fan idea is ap- 
propriate. The answers to the following questions con- 
tain the letters ‘‘fan’’ or ‘‘phan’’:
-P-A-G-E-197

. A girl’s fan? Fanny. 
. An excitable fan? Fanatic.

. A fan seem among pigeons? Fantail. 
. A musical fan? Fantasia. 
. An ethereal fan? Phantom. 
. A whimsical, imaginary fan? Phantasy. 
. A capricious fan? Fancy. SCHON

Japanese Fan Race.—Divide the company into two sides. 
Have one representative from each side contest at a time. 
Count one point for each ‘‘win’’ and at the close announce 
the winning side. Give the two contestants each a fan and 
a downy feather. They must fan the feather over an 
agreed course, not allowing it to touch the floor until it is 
across the finishing line. The feather may be caught on 
the fan to prevent its falling to the floor, but contestants 
are not allowed to advance while holding it on the fan. 
Japanese Fan Ball.—This is a good contest for the out- 
of-doors and may be played on a tennis court, if one is 
available. Two players contest at a time, one for each side, 
Ordinary Japanese fans with handles or palm-leaf fans 
are necessary, as well as toy balloons. <A goal post, two 
uprights six feet apart, and a crosspiece are set up at 
each end of a field the size of a tennis court. A smaller 
goal and crosspiece are set up in the center, midway be- 
tween the two goals. Two captains choose sides. When 
the umpire claps his hands each captain tosses his ball 
high in the air. The two players then try to keep the 
ball in the air and going toward the spponent’s goal by 
fanning and guiding. The ball must go over or under the 
middle barrier and then through the goal on the opposite 
side. If it should fall to the ground, the player may pick

  188 PHUNOLOGY 
it up on the fan, as a tennis ball on a racket, not being 
allowed to touch it with the hands. Following these, two 
more players contest, and so on until the entire company 
has taken part. Points are counted, and the winning team 
is announced. 
Japanese Crab Race.—Let four players represent each 
side. Line them up back of the starting point, the first 
two on all fours, with heels on starting line. At the signal 
to go these make their way as rapidly as possible back- 
ward to a goal line some eight or ten yards distant. As 
soon as their hands touch this goal line they may stand 
erect and rush back to the starting point, slapping the 
next team-mate, who had assumed the ‘‘crab’’ position as 
soon as he saw his partner cross the goal line, on the 
outstretched hand. This player then starts back to the 
goal line and returns to touch off his next team-mate, and 
so on. The last player claps his hands on returning and 
crossing the starting line. 
Refreshments—Serve rice cakes and cherry ice. Tea 
and sponge cant also be appropriate, or sugar 
wafers. : 
ANOTHER JAPANESE GAME 
Catching the Snake’s Tatil_—One player is ‘‘It.’’? The 
rest all form a line, with hands on one another’s shoulders. 
The object of the chaser is to tag the last player in the line 
The line winds in and out and endeavors to prevent him 
from doing this. Should the last player be tagged, he 
becomes ‘‘It,’’ and the choser takes the head of the line. 
If the line becomes broken, the player responsible becomes 
chaser.

PEANUT PARTY 
Write invitations on thin paper, roll or fold them, and 
insert them in peanut shells emptied of their contents. Tie 
up each shell with a bit of narrow baby ribbon. 
Blind Peanut Hunt.—Blindfold every one and then 
conduct a peanut hunt, placing the peanuts about on chairs 
and tables, being careful to move out of the way all break- 
able bric-a-brac. Or the peanut hunt may be conducted 
in the regular way. 
Peanut-Rolling Contest—Place peanuts on starting line 
at intervals of three feet. Give each contestant a tooth- 
pick. At signal all commence to roll peanuts across the 
room to the goal line. Immediately on their finish an- 
other row of contestants take their places and start the 
next race, and so on until all the crowd have participated, 
The winners of the various groups will then contest to 
_Aecide who is the champion peanut roller. 
Peanut Dip Race.—Hach player thrusts the right-hand 
palm down into a bowl of peanuts, scooying up as many as 
possible on the back of his hand. must then walk 
rapidly around the room, carrying on his hand all the 
nuts scooped up. The player bringing back to the goal the 
most peanuts wins. 
Progress Peanut Stab.—In the center of each table place 
a bowl containing one hundred peanuts in shell. Lay a 
long hatpin at each plate. At the head table have a bell. 
Each player has his right hand tied to his side by a 
ribbon or cord and is then seated. Be sure to have the 
same number of players at each table. The Chairman of 
the Social Committee may now ring the bell at the head 
table, and all players begin to spear peanuts from the bowl. 
When the bowl on any table is empty, the fact should be 
announced, and immediately all stabbing at all tables 
ceases, and players count their peanuts. The two with the 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  190 PHUNOLOGY 
largest number at each table progress to the next table, 
having tally card punched and score noted. All peanuts 
are replaced in the bowls ready for the next game. Five 
hundred may be the score limit, and the first player to 
reach that number should be declared winner. 
Peanut Dolls.—Provide peanuts, toothpicks, pen and ink, 
tissue paper, paste, and chewing gum, and allow ten min- 
utes for making dolls. Some wonderful creations will, no 
doubt, be the result. 
Refreshments —There are all sorts of peanut possibilities 
when it comes to ‘‘eats.’? Peanut butter sandwiches, salted 
peanuts, peanut brittle, peanut chocolates, and ice cream 
with ground peanuts sprinkled over it—any of these would 
do. We would not suggest that all of them be used, how- 
ever, at one time. There is danger of getting too much 
peanut flavor in your menu. On each plate of ‘‘eats’’ place 
a peanut shell neatly cracked and tied with a piece of 
ribbon. In these you have inserted clever quotations, 
couplets, or fortunes. 
Oruer Peanut GAMES 
Peanut Guess.—Let the players guess at the number of 
peanuts in a basket on the table. 
\Peanut-Shelling Contest—Place a saucer containing 
seven to ten peanuts before each contestant. They must 
‘be shelled, inner husks removed, and no kernels broken. 
The player doing the best and quickest work wins. 
Peanut Race.—Chairs are placed at each end of the room, 
one chair for each contestant. Six peanuts for each con- 
testant are placed at equal distances apart across the room. 
Small spoons are provided. At a given signal all contes- 
tants start from chairs, run to nearest peanut, pick it up, 
return with it, and deposit it on the chair: then back to 
get the second one, and so on until ali the peanuts are
-P-A-G-E-201
  
PHUNOLOGY 191 
on the chair. Contestants are not allowed to touch pea- 
nuts with their hands, and should they drop a peanut they 
must pick it up with the spoon before continuing the race, 
running from the point where the peanut was dropped. 
Peanut Pitch—Have a cardboard, two feet by three, 
marked into ten or a dozen divisions of different sizes, 
Mark the smaller spaces with larger numbers. Let each 
player pitch ten peanuts at this‘field, which rests on a 
table. The score, of course, represents the sum of the 
numbers on which the peanuts fell. Sides could be chosen 
for this game, allowing three pitches to each player. 
Dropping Peanuts.—The players hold peanuts between 
the thumb and forefinger, arm extended straight out from 
the shoulder, and endeavor to drop them into a vase. It 
will add to the fun to have sides contest in this, totaling 
the scores for all the players of each side. 
Peanut Walking Contest—Have a row of peanuts for 
each contestant, with peanuts six inches apart all the way 
across the floor. The contestants must walk down this line 
of peanuts, stepping in between them all the way along 
without stepping on any of them. The player to reach 
the goal line first without having stepped on any peanuts, 
or having stepped on the least number, wins. 
Nut-Guessing Contest.— 
What nut is a sandy shore? Beechnut. 
What nut is a girl’s name? Hazelnut.

AEROPLANE PARTY 
Write invitations on wing-shaped cards or have a small 
aéroplane drawn in the corner of the cards. 
Would you like an aéroplane party? 
And would you like to fly 
‘And flirt with all the angels 
Away up in the sky? 
Then come around next Friday, 
And don’t you make it late, 
For, child, we’ll start this party 
Right on the dot at eight. 
FiyIne 
Let the entire company form a circle, with one person 
in the center, and play ‘‘Flying,’’ after the fashion of 
*‘Simon Says, ‘Thumbs Up.’’’ Allow several feet of space 
between players. The player in the center directs the 
game. He may call, for instance, ‘‘ Eagles fly,’’? waving 
his arms in flying motion. All players do likewise. Each 
time he names something that flies the entire group must 
go through the motion of flying with him. But when he 
names something that does not fly, as ‘‘Cows fly,’’ all 
players except the leader must make no motion with arms. 
The leader goes through the flying motion each time, no 
matter what is called. Any player offending by flying

PHUNOLOGY 193 
when he ought not to do so or by neglecting to fly when 
he ought to do so must drop out of the circle. 
Now divide the company into four groups—the Bombers, 
the Scouts, the Dirigibles, and the Hydros—and let the 
groups engage in contests. Groundwork is the first step 
in the making of an aviator; so the first contest will rep- 
resent. 
Groundwork 
One contestant represents each group. Four rows of 
oyster crackers are laid across the room, each cracker be- 
ing placed on a small piece of paper for the sake of clean- 
liness. Five crackers for each row will probably be 
enough. At a given signal contestants start hopping from 
the starting point, stooping to eat the crackers on the floor 
as they come to them. Contestants must touch only the 
hopping foot to the floor, even when stooping to eat. 
Crackers must be picked up by the mouth only, no use of 
the hands being allowed. When a contestant has eaten 
the last cracker in his row he immediately hops back to 
the starting line. Award points for first, second, and 
third place. 
The next step for the cadet is dual-flying, when he 
takes the air with an instructor, who teaches him how to 
“take off’? and land his machine, showing him various 
things about the handling of an aéroplane. So the next 
contest is

Two contestants from each group, preferably a boy and 
a girl. Blindfold them. Slip large paper bibs over their 
heads for the protection of their clothes. Furnish each 
one with a peeled banana, and at the signal each boy feeds 
his girl partner and each girl her boy partner. 
The Baby Marathon, or any other game in which couples 
contest, may be substituted for the Banana Feed.

Next, the student flyer is allowed to make his first flight 
alone. This is called his solo flight, and the custom is to 
tie a white handkerchief on the tail of his machine. All 
other planes in the field then give him plenty of room. 
So the next contest is 
Solo-Flying 
One contestant from each group stands on the platform 
facing the crowd and, following the pitch as given on the 
piano, sings a low note, then a high note, after this man- 
ner: ‘‘Do do.’’ After one time around, the pianist 
increases the range, and so on until only one contestant 
ean make it, this person being able to sing the lowest and 
highest note. Quality of voice doesn’t matter. All that 
is necessary is for the person to sing the note at the given 
pitch. 
This contest may be varied by requiring the contestants 
to sing verses of well-known songs, numbering the words 
as they sing, the judges deciding which is the best. This 
is done in this manner:   
“Yankee (one) Doodle (two) came (three) to (four) 
town. (five) 
Riding (six) on (seven) a (eight) pony (nine),’’ ete 
Now that the student has mastered his ship, he is put on 
stunt-flying. So an unsuspecting victim is selected from 
each group for a 
Stunt Flight 
The leaders and several other persons in each group 
should have been made acquainted with this stunt early 
in the evening. The victims may be brought in one at a 
time, or all four flights may be put on at once, after the

fashion explained in the Aéroplane Ride in the chapter on 
stunts. 
Now comes cross-country flying, when the student flies 
to some near-by town, lands his machine, and then brings 
it back to the field. So we must have a 
Cross-Country Contest 
Select a girl and boy to represent each group. All four 
girls stand on one side of the room, the boys on the other, 
each toeing the mark ready for the signal to go. Each 
boy is given a sealed envelope containing the name of some 
tune he must whistle to his partner. At the given signal 
he runs across to his partner, touching her outstretched 
hand as he comes up. Not until then can he open the 
envelope to see what tune he must whistle. As soon as 
he ascertains this he whistles it to her. She has been 
provided with a slip of paper and a pencil and writes the 
name of the tune down, handing him the slip. Immediately 
he returns, delivesing the slip to one of the judges, who 
notes whether or not it is correct. The first boy to return 
with a correct slip wins. No tipping off of contestants is 
allowed. 
The flyer now receives his finishing-up lesson in a course 
on formation-flying, when with a number of other ships he 
practices flying in scouting, bombing, battle, and other 
formations. It’s a thrilling sight to see a number of ships 
flying in formation high above the earth. So the next 
contest is 
Formation-Flying 
Nine contestants are selected from each group. Line 
them up in four rows. Two groups compete at a time. 
The winners compete to decide the champion. If the black- 
board and room are large enough, all four teams may con-

test at once. The head man in each group is given a piece 
of chalk. At the signal to go each head man hops to the 
blackboard across the room and writes ‘‘a.’’ He hops 
back, hands the chalk to No. 2, who has moved up, and 
returns to his group. No. 2 hops to the blackboard and 
writes ‘‘e,’’ hops back, and hands the chalk to No. 3. And 
so on it goes until ‘‘aéroplane’’ is written. The word ‘‘fly’’ 
may be used where the crowd is small. Teams are awarded 
points according to the order in which they finish. 
The ‘‘Weaver’s Relay’’ described elsewhere in this book 
may be substituted for the above game. 
Finish up the evening’s fun with an 
Air Race 
One aviator represents each group. Contestants line up. 
Each has a paper cornucopia on a string tied about level 
with his head. A paper aéroplane might be devised to 
take the place of the cornucopia. Participants endeavor 
to blow cornucopias to the end of the strings. 
Serve ‘‘landing-gear confection’? (doughnuts) and ‘‘hot 
gas’’ (hot chocolate) or ‘‘milk from the Milky Way.’’ 
ADDITIONAL AEROPLANE GAMES 
Aéroplane 
See how many words can be made out of the word 
‘‘aéroplane.’’ 
Airship 
This is an adaptation of the old game of stagecoach and 
will afford lots of fun. Each player is given the name of 
some part of an aéroplane or of some term peculiar to 
aviation. These are introduced by a leader in a story. 
As each part or term is called, the person representing it
-P-A-G-E-207
  
PHUNOLOGY 197 
will rise, whirl about, and, if possible, do some appropriate 
stunt. For instance, ‘‘propeller’’ gets up, whirls about, 
and then swings his arms in wide circles; the ‘‘wings’’ 
flop the arms in flying motion; the ‘‘engine’’ makes a 
terrible racket; the ‘‘struts’’ strut; the ‘‘side slip’’ does a 
Charley Chaplin glide; the ‘‘spin’’ whirls twice; the 
“Immelman turn’’ whirls once, then whirls again halfway 
and then back, ete. Hach takes his seat immediately on 
completion of his stunt. When ‘‘airship’’ is called all the 
players must rise, whirl about once, and sit down. 
Following is a list of parts and terms familiar to the 
aviator: Propeller, skid, wings, fusilage, engine, aileron, 
struts, elevator, rudder, altimeter, stick, wheel, landing 
gear, gun, switch, gasoline, volplane, tail spin, spiral, side 
slip, loop, Immelman turn, wing-over, nose dive, bank, 
angel dive, solo, stunt, helmet, observer, goggles, spiral, 
zoom, air pocket, wind shield, cadet, ace, instructor, line-up, 
formation, mechanic, ete. 
Aéroplane Charades 
Groups may represent words familiar in aviation in 
charade, announcing the number of syllables as the only 
clue. 
Altimeter (all-tie-meter). 
Aéroplane (air-o-plane or plain). 
Tail skid (tale skid). 
Aileron (ail or ale-e-run). 
Tail spin (tale spin). 
Side slip (side slip). 
Engine (N-gin). 
Aviator (a V-ate-her). 
Cadet (K-debt). 
Strut (strut). 
Members of the groups will easily figure out ways for 
acting out these words and possibly others.

  “198 PHUNOLOGY 
A POLLYANNA SOCIAL 
Pollyanna and her glad game will afford the back- 
ground for a most delightful program for almost any time 
of the year. It will be most appropriate, however, in the 
fall. 
As the guests come in each is assigned to one of three 
villages—Happyville, Gladtown, or Pleasantville. If the 
affair is held in the Sunday school rooms, separate rooms 
may be assigned to each town. The name of the village 
should be displayed over its headquarters. Let each village 
proceed to elect 2 mayor or mayoress. 
A governor has been appointed by the Social Committee 
and presides over the events of the evening, beginning the 
social with a short address on his pleasure, as Governor of 
the State of Happiness, in meeting with the principal 
towns of the State in a grand tournament. He then in 
troduces some one previously selected to tell one of the 
stories from ‘‘Pollyanna.’’ This person should be a good 
story-teller. If it is impossible to get such a person, have 
some one tell something about the book and explain Polly- 
anna’s glad game. 
Decorate the mayor of each town with a huge paste- 
board star with the word ‘‘MAYOR”’ printed on it. A 
town clerk might also be appointed for each town, as well 
as three judges for the tournament. 
If there are many present who do not know each other, 
the first event should be a contest between the towns to 
see which can get all of its citizens acquainted first. The 
mayor announces the fact to the judges as soon as he is 
sure everybody knows everybody else. One of the judges 
may conduct a short quiz to make sure they are not 
bluffing. ‘‘Miss Smith, who is this gentleman?’ and so 
on. For all contests award three points for first place, 
two points for second, and one point for third.
-P-A-G-E-209
    
PHUNOLOGY 199 
Each town is now allowed five minutes to get up a yell. 
Both the originality and the enthusiasm and precision with 
which the yell is rendered count. 
Next, the towns are given a few minutes to see who can 
give the best reason for being glad or express the best 
glad sentiment. 
Then follows a ‘‘Pollyanna’’ contest. Each town is 
allowed a given time to make as many words as possible 
out of the word ‘‘Pollyanna.’’ Proper names do not count. 
One list is prepared by each town, the town clerk writing 
as suggestions come from different citizens. At the close 
judges verify lists of different towns and award points 
accordingly. 
Now have a rhyming contest, giving each town four 
words to be used at the end of each line in its rhyme. 
Thus one town is given ‘‘smile, style, while, aisle’’; another 
is given ‘‘list, kissed, missed, insist’’; another, ‘‘girl, curl, 
furl, whirl.’’ Each town is privileged to offer as many 
rhymes as it pleases, only a limited time being allowed for 
the writing. Judges decide the winners. 
The social closes with a football series, two towns con- 
testing and the third playing the victor. The losing team 
that makes the highest score takes second place in this 
event. A table serves as a football field. A piece of green 
or brown wrapping paper is stretched over it and marked 
off with ten-yard lines to represent a football field. Small 
goal posts are made out of sticks stuck in spools, which 
serve as standards, with a cross-bar tacked across. These 
are placed at either end of the field. The football is an 
empty eggshell painted brown and made to resemble a 
football by marking it with ink. The ball is placed in the 
middle of the field, and a player from each side in turn 
tries to blow it through the opposing goal. A touchdown 
is scored each time the ball goes between the goal posts and 
over the line. This counts six points. A safety is scored

each time the ball goes over the goal line in bounds, but 
not between the goal posts, counting two points. The ball 
is always placed in the center of the field after each trial. 
It is well to have two balls for the sake of emergency. 
At one social where a box of chocolates was to be given 
to the town winning the tournament this is the yell that 
took first place: 
*¢Chocolates brown, chocolates sweet, 
Chocolates we are bound to eat. 
We are here to get our fill, 
We are here from Happyville.’’ 
‘At another social of the same sort this yell won: 
“‘Rickety! Rickety! Rill! 
We’re from Pleasantville! 
We’ve never worked, and we never will! 
Hurrah for Pleasantville! ’’ 
The winning glad sentiment was expressed thus: 
  ‘Tt snows, it rains, it tries to sleet, 
Happyville is glad to live and meet; 
We meet to laugh and laugh to greet, 
No matter how it tries to sleet.’’ 
In the rhyming contest this one got the decision: 
‘¢The lad stood in the burning aisle 
To keep himself in style. 
The captain said: ‘Why do you smile?’ 
He said: ‘It’s worth the while.’ ’’ 
Three points are allowed in each event for first place, 
two for second, and one for third. Post all scores on a 
blackboard as they are made. 
Sandwiches, pirtk lemonade, and stick candy were served 
by one crowd of young people as refreshments.

UaugHina HANDKERCHIEF 
If an additional game is desired, have all players form 
a circle. One person stands in the center. He throws a 
handkerchief into the air as high as he can and starts 
laughing. Every one must laugh with him until the hand- 
kerchief touches the floor, when there must be perfect 
silence. Any one laughing after the handkerchief touches 
the floor must leave the circle. At the end of five minutes 
the town losing the fewest of its citizens in this manner is 
declared winner. ‘‘Pollyanna,’’ a book by Eleanor H. 
Porter. 
INDOOR TRACK MEET 
Contestants—Harvard, red and white; Yale, blue and 
white; Princeton, black and yellow; Amherst, purple and 
white. ' 
Every one who came had a small pennant (paper printed 
in colors) of one of the colleges pinned on by four girls. 
Captains had been appointed several days previously, as 
well as judges for the meet, a clerk to post on blackboard 
points made by each college, an announcer, and a starter. 
First place in an event counted three points; second place 
in an event counted two points; third place in an event 
counted one point. Colleges were assigned separate rooms, 
which were decorated with their respective college colors, 
as headquarters. These all opened into the main Sunday 
school auditorium where the meet was held. The announcer 
started things by giving each college five minutes in which 
to prepare one or more yells, or songs, stating that this 
event would count in the meet, the judges deciding which 
was first, second, and third. The captains drew for the 
order in which they were to be given their turn. Following 
are the events: 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 PHUNOLOGY 
1. Two-Hundred-Yard Dash.—A ball of adding machine 
tape (paper) is necessary for this event, or cloth strips of 
sufficient length may also do, or telegrapher’s tape. Any- 
thing of the sort about seven or eight yards in length and 
two or three inches wide will do. Four pairs of scissors. 
At a given signal the contestants begin to cut from one 
end of the tape through to the other end, which is being 
held by members of the respective teams, four pieces of 
tape of the same length, of course, being provided. This 
is more exciting than it sounds. 
2. Obstacle Race-—Same as No. 1, except that about four 
knots are tied in the tape at intervals. The contestants 
must cut to the knots, untie them, and go on, being careful 
not to tear the tape. No knot must be untied until the 
contestant reaches it in cutting. 
13. Potato or Peanut Race.—This is just the ordinary 
potato race, making contestants walk instead of run, or 
lraving them carry the peanuts on a knife instead of the 
potatoes in a spoon. 
4. Handicap Race——Girl and boy contestant from each 
team. Four chairs in a row, on each of which are a needle 
and a piece of thread. Right arm of girl tied to left arm 
of boy; placed in front of chairs. At signal each girl picks 
up the needle with her left hand, and each boy the thread 
with his right, and then the boys try to thread the needles. 
5. Standing Broad Smile—Measure smile of each con- 
testant with tape measure. The broadest smile wins. Boy 
and girl together might represent a college, the combined 
width of their smiles being counted. Make contestants 
stand in line, facing crowd. 
6. Inside Run.—Drinking glass of water with teaspoon, 
contestants sitting, facing crowd. Girl feeds boy with a 
spoon. 
7. Boarding House Reach.—Contestants sit in four chairs 
in a row, and each one’s reach is measured with tape. 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  
PHUNOLOGY 203 
8) Tug of War—Piece of candy tied in middle of string. 
Contestants start chewing at either end of string, and of 
course the first one to get to the candy wins. It will be 
necessary to have three contests to decide this; for instance, 
Yale vs. Amherst and Harvard vs. Princeton. The two 
winners then fight it out for first place. 
9. Running High Jump.—Contestants strike low note, 
then high note, the pitch being given by some one person 
at the pidno. The one who goes from the lowest to the 
highest wins the event. Quality of voice does not count, 
just so the contestant makes the necessary noise at the 
proper pitch. 
‘M10. Relay Race——Three or four girls (could be boys) 
from each team. Sit in line on platform by teams, each 
provided with one or two crackers. At given signal the 
first contestant on each team begins eating a cracker. When 
contestant has finished she must whistle. Not until she has 
done so can her next team-mate begin. The team whose 
last contestant eats a cracker and whistles first wins the 
event. 
Teams are allowed to root and give their yells as they 
would do at a regular track meet. 
This social at one place proved such a tremendous success 
that on request it was made an annual feature, each time 
varying the stunts. 
AppITIONAL EVENTS 
One-Yard Dash.—Contestants attempt to push a penny 
the distance of one yard across the floor by means of the 
nose. 
Standing High Jump.—Three doughnuts suspended in 
doorway about four inches above the mouth of jumpers. 
Contestants with hands tied attempt to get a bite. One 
bite wins. 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
    204 PHUNOLOGY 
Hurdle Race.—Contestants take seats and thread six 
needles. 
Bun Race.—Two poles a good distance apart, connected 
with a clothesline, from which are suspended strings of 
different lengths according to height of each contestant. 
A bun is tied on each string. Contestants with hands tied 
behind them, at signal to start, try to eat the bun. Con- 
stant moving of line by their efforts makes it almost im- 
possible to get a bite. Soon a boy gets hold, gets his bun 
on the floor, and finishes it there. 
Feminine Discus Throw.—Give each girl an empty paper 
bag and a string. Allow the participants one minute to 
inflate the bag with ‘‘hot air.’’ Tie the string around the 
bag’s neck and throw the inflated ‘‘discus’’ as far as pos- 
sible. Since the bags will go in almost any direction 
except the one the thrower intended, and some of them are 
likely even to blow back on the contestants, this test of 
skill should be appropriately dubbed a ‘‘Feminine Discus 
Throw.’’—Beryl W. Hundley. 
Twenty-Foot Dash—The contestants must hop a given 
distance on one foot and carry, without spilling, a glass of 
water in the right hand.—Beryl W. Hundley. 
A Crowing Contest—The contestants may be solemnly 
seated on a line of camp stools and each given four crackers 
to eat. After the consumption of the crackers, the con- 
testants are unexpectedly told to ‘‘Cock-a-doodle-doo.’’ 
Crackers leave the mouth dry, and the lassie who can utter 
her clarion call well deserves her ‘‘chanticleer’’? medal— 
Beryl W. Hundley. 
Costume Race.—This spectacular event is likely to pro- 
voke the greatest fun of the evening. Contestants enter 
the race with unbuttoned shoes and carrying hats, coats, 
umbrellas, camp stools, and suit-cases containing gloves, 
button hooks, curl papers, and rubbers. At the given 
signal they race across the room to a chalk mark on the

floor; open their camp stools; seat themselves; open their 
suit-cases; take out the button hooks; button their shoes; 
put on their curl papers; put on their rubbers; don their 
hats, coats, and gloves; raise their umbrellas; pick up their 
suit-cases and camp stools and, with what breath is left in 
them, race wildly back to the starting point—Beryl W. 
Hundley. 
Rainy-Day Race.—Girl contestants stand in line with 
closed satchels in which are rubbers and gloves. Each is 
given also a closed umbrella. At the given signal they 
open satchels, take out rubbers, put them on, take out 
gloves, put them on, open umbrellas, close satchels, and 
walk about one hundred feet to a line, carrying satchels 
and open umbrellas. Here they shut umbrellas, open 
satchels, remove gloves and rubbers, put them in the 
satchels, close satchels, and walk back as hurriedly as pos- 
sible, carrying satchels and umbrellas The first one back 
to the starting point is winner. 
Peanut Race.—Push a peanut across the room with a 
toothpick. 
Drunken Man’s Relay.—See ‘‘Spanish Relay.’’ 
Cane Rush.—Hide sticks to represent canes about the 
room. Let every one hunt, after dividing the company 
into groups. As the canes are found they are handed to 
the captain of the side. The side finding the most wins. 
Running Broad Jump.—tTwo representatives from each 
group. Contestants whistle, while everybody else laughs 
and tries to make them laugh. The one whistling the long- 
est without laughing wins. 
Javelin Throw.—Contestants throw a hen’s feather as 
far as possible. 
Girls’ Fifty-Yard Dash.—Girls wind and unwind a spool 
of cotton thread. 
Three-Legged Race.—Three contestants from each team  
-P-A-G-E-216
  
  206 PHUNOLOGY 
try to look solemn, while the onlookers laugh and joke, 
endeavoring to make them smile. 
Marathon Race.—Boy and girl represent each group. 
Each couple is provided with needle, thread, three buttons, 
and a piece of cloth. Boy threads the needle, and girl 
sews on buttons, attempting to do it in record time. 
Hammer Throw.—Inflate paper sacks. Tie them on long 
strings. Each contestant must throw an inflated sack, 
holding the string by the end and swinging it several 
times over the head, as in the hammer throw. 
Jug Race.—Place jugs on their sides on the floor. Each 
contestant sits on a jug, feet off the floor, and writes his 
name. 
Obstacle Race—At the start contestants must thread a 
needle. Then they run to a chair in the center of the 
room, where each must eat a cracker. After whistling here 
they run to another chair at the end of the room, where 
each must drink a glass of water. Then they rush back 
to the starting point. 
Discus Throw.—Contestants must throw paper plates, 
discus fashion—that is, holding the plate like a waiter 
holds a tray and balancing on one foot, taking two short 
hops and a forward step to the line as they let the 
“‘plate’’ go. 
Thirty-Inch Dash.—A piece of string thirty inches long, 
with a marshmallow tied at the end. The other end is 
placed in the mouth of the contestant, and, using the 
mouth alone without help from his hands, he must chew 
up to the marshmallow. The first contestant to eat his 
marshmallow wins. 
Shot Put.—Give each one five or ten peanuts and place 
a quart jar or tumbler at a certain distance from the line. 
Contestants see which can throw the most peanuts into the 
receptacle. This may be contested by the groups, each 
player getting a chauce. In this case a receptacle would  
-P-A-G-E-217
  
PHUNOLOGY 207 
be placed opposite each team’s line-up, and the side putting 
the most peanuts into its jar wins. If contested in this 
manner, not over three peanuts would be given to each 
player. Beans may be used instead of peanuts. 
Foot Race.—Each group lines up, toe against heel all 
the way along. Measure each line to determine winner. 
Standing High Jump—tThree or four doughnuts are 
suspended, as in the Bun Race, at four or five inches above 
the mouths of the contestants. Contestants stand with 
hands tied behind them. The first contestant to get a bite 
wins. 
One League used the Track Meet idea, dubbing it ‘‘Cen- 
terville College Opening.’? ‘The towns competing were 
Cootie Hike, Possum Trot, Skeeter Grove, Chipmunk Hill, 
and Hog Wallow, each sending representatives. A loving 
cup (tin) was presented to the town winning the most 
events. 
  
A NEWSPAPER SOCIAL v 
Materials Required—A big stack of old newspapers, 
several papers of pins, four or five pencils, a few sheets of 
writing paper, and refreshments, of course; also some 
fashion plates and ten cents’ worth of dried beans. This 
is not an expensive social. 
Use some scheme of choosing partners by chance, as far 
as possible coupling a boy with a girl. Give the boy a 
bundle of newspapers and a strip off a paper of pins (no 
scissors) and tell him to dress the lady. Give a half or 
three-fourths of an hour. Let the time be definite. This 
will be extremely amusing, and some of the costumes will 
be really quite wonderful—split skirts, skirts with tunics, 
hats with feather duster trimmings, ete. Have your room 
decorated with fashion plates, which the boys may consult. 
If you have some older ladies present, appoint them as
-P-A-G-E-218
  208 PHUNOLOGY 
judges. When the time is up have some one play a march 
and have the girls march in review around the room for 
the inspection of the judges. After a couple of times 
around, let their boy partners join them. The judges will 
award the prize for the best dressed—that is, the prize 
goes to the boy dressing the best-dressed girl. One League 
gave a tiny undressed doll as first prize. Let there also 
be a booby prize. 
Divide the crowd into four, five, or six groups. You can 
adapt the number to your attendance. Tell them they are 
to edit a League newspaper. Give one group the editorial 
department, one the sports, one society, advertising, tele- 
graphic news, ete. Let them understand that the news 
is to be purely local—that is, let it pertain to League mat- 
ters, your Church people, ete., and whether or not it can 
stand the test of truth will not matter—in fact, vivid 
imagination will be at a premium. Give a certain length 
of time for this stunt, then have the paper assembled and 
read. It will be a great mirth producer. 
Next, pass to each one a small bundle of ten or twelve 
beans, each bundle being done in newspaper, of course. 
Bundles may be tied, twisted, or folded. (This is just the 
old bean stunt, whereby you exchange beans or rather for- 
feit them to the party who succeeds in making you say a 
forbidden word, as I, Yes, No, or any other stipulated 
word.) Let this go on for ten or fifteen minutes only, 
then declare a halt and tell every one he has as many 
dollars with which to buy his lunch as he has beans. 
Refreshments——Have something that can be put in a 
bundle; have a few dainty packages wrapped nicely and 
some great big ones wrapped in lots of newspaper. Have 
the interiors, of course, all alike. Have some clever person 
act as auctioneer and auction off the packages, accepting 
beans as dollars in payment. Forbid the opening of pack- 
ages until all are sold.

Any.’’ All appropriate gestures and oratorical ability 
are to be noted by the judges. 
(2) The ones that can take in the most engage in a 
gumdrop contest, the gumdrop being tied in the middle 
of a string. The contestants then, with hands behind them 
and one end of the string in each mouth, start chewing up 
the string toward the gumdrop. The first one to it wins. 
(3) The large-mouth representatives take the platform 
and grin broadly while the judges measure with a tape 
measure the width of each mouth. 
4. The chewing gum is now called into service. Hach 
one chews his stick of gum and then fashions some sort of 
animal out of it to enter in the animal show. A prize may 
be given for the best. 
5. Songs.—The crowd may now gather about the piano 
and sing such songs as ‘‘Smiles,’’ ‘‘Smile, Smile, Smile,’’ 
“Smile the While You Kiss Me Sad Adieu,”’ ete—Adapted 
from suggestions by Mrs. S. M. Laws, Pocasset, Okla.

” Games 
In between the side shows and the freak exhibition you 
might introduce a couple of games, such as the following: 
Zoo.—Players sit in a circle, with one player standing 
in the center blindfolded. Each player has been given the 
name of some animal. The blindfolded player calls the 
names of two animals, and they must immediately change 
seats, he endeavoring to catch one of them or get one of the 
seats vacated. The player caught or losing his chair must 
take the place of the catcher in the center. When ‘‘Zoo’’ 
is called all players must change seats, the catcher en- 
deavoring to tag some one or get a chair in the mix-up. 
Merry-Go-Round.—Play some rollicking game, such as 
the ‘‘Jolly Miller’’ or ‘‘Three Deep,’’ for instance. 
For refreshments serve pink lemonade, using strawberry 
juice or grape juice for coloring, and clown cakes. The 
clown cakes may be made by icing the cakes white and then 
making eyes, nose, and mouth with red or pink icing. A 
erépe paper dunce cap may decorate each cake, using a 
toothpick as a hatpin.

AN EXCURSION TO EPWORTH 
THe Best League Soctau Given By Broapway Epworth 
League, BowLine Green, Ky. 
About a week before invitations were sent to the mem- 
bers of the League who were not in the habit of coming 
to the social and also to other young people of the Church 
whom we hoped to interest in the League work. The in- 
vitations read like this: ‘‘You are requested to join an 
excursion to Epworth, the home of the Wesleys, on [date]. 
This train leaves [name of residence] at 7:30 o’clock. 
Single ticket, one smile; round trip, one smile and a hand- 
shake.’’ 
A member of the Social Committee met the guests at the 
door and pinned on them a tag on which was written the 
owner’s name. As usual, the program was begun with 
Scripture-reading and prayer; then the young man who 
was asked to be conductor blew a horn and called outs 
‘*All aboard!’’ In the meantime there were passed around 
slips of paper on which were written a number and also 
some subject relating to the life of the Wesleys. After each 
boy had found the girl who had the slip of paper corres 
sponding with his, the conductor led the party to a long 
hall with chairs arranged like a train. He explained by 
saying that each couple was to talk about the subject 
written on his slip of paper. Some of the different sub- 
jects are the following: ‘‘Home Life of the Wesleys,’’ 
“John Wesley as a Philanthropist,’’ ‘‘Charles Wesley as 
a Singer,’’? ‘“‘John Wesley’s Dying Words,’’ ‘‘First 
Methodist Conference,’’ ‘‘Susanna Wesley.’ 
About every three or five minutes the conductor would 
call out, ‘‘Change cars,’’ then every boy moved a seat 
farther. When every boy had talked to every girl on each 
subject, the conductor said: ‘‘ All out for Epworth!’’

At this time one of the young men gave an interesting 
description of Epworth, then all came back into the parlor, 
where the following games were played. First, each couple 
was given a slip of paper. The papers were headed this 
way: 
“Some Traits of Character Which Epworth Leaguers 
Should Possess.’’ 
Humility, written like this: Muhtilyi. 
Patience, written like this: Tiapnece. 
Faith, written like this: Afthi. 
Self-control, written like this: Lortnoc-fles, 
Courage, written like this: Roucgae. 
Tact, written like this: Catt. 
Kindness, written like this: Dessnink. 
Love, written like this: Leov. 
Then a word-building contest was given. ‘‘ Epworth 
League’’ are the words from which other words were 
made. Some formed as many as fifty words in the ten 
minutes. After this cream and cake were served. The 
cakes were wrapped with paper and tied with yellow and 
white ribbons. On these papers were written invitations 
to the next Sunday’s devotional meeting: 
**As this cake is sweet, 
So the League is hard to beat. 
Be at Broadway at 6:45 Sunday eve, 
And some of the good you’re sure to reeeive.’’ 
The following games were also played: 
1. A table was arranged with a number of articles on it. 
The guests passed through the room and then wrote the 
articles they remembered seeing. 
2. A musical game. A list of questions was asked, and 
a young lady played on the piano the answers to the ques-

And be fed in an alphabetical way. 
We'll both be sad if you stay away. 
‘We need the money, you the fun. 
At seven-thirty ’twill be begun. 
GAMES 
Give each guest, or group of guests if there are many, 
a sheet of paper bearing a single letter of the alphabet 
and instruct him or her to write a verse about some promi- 
nent local person or thing after the manner of the nursery 
A BC books, making an illustration to fit. Bind the sheets. 
into a booklet and give it as a prize to the one making the 
best verse. 
Progressive LETTERS 
Place face down on tables cards bearing letters of the 
alphabet. Play after the manner of ail progressive games. 
One player turns up a card, and the one calling the name 
of some town beginning with that letter gets it. The next 
player draws. At the end of two minutes the couple having 
the most cards move up to the next table. Change fre- 
quently to boys’ names, names of flowers, ete. 
SPELLING Matcu 
Choose sides. Distribute large cut-out letters. The 
leader announces a word, and the players holding the let- 
ters of which it is composed step forward and hold their 
letters so as to form it. The side forming the word first 
chooses from the opposite side. 
Worp Groups 
Hang around each one’s neck a large-sized card bearing 
the initial of his or her last name. Tell them that the let- 
ters are to spell themselves into words. This way: If Mr. 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 PHUNOLOGY 
N. and Miss O. are standing together, each one is privileged 
to write the word ‘‘No’’ on the card; then if Mr. T. comes 
along, all three may write ‘‘Not’’ on the cards. Then the 
three of them may tour the room in search of other letters 
to build up their lists. It is a good plan to write the 
full name at the top of the card when it is given out; so 
that if any in the company are unknown to others when 
they meet in spelling the words, the written names may 
serve as introductions. The one who has the least number 
of words may be given an A B C book. 
REFRESHMENTS 
Pass three white letters and one red letter to each guest, 
stating that each white letter entitles one to something to 
eat and the red one to something to drink beginning with 
that letter. If any person has drawn a duplicate or thinks 
he can arrange a more pleasing menu, allow him to ex- 
change. Of course many of the combinations will be very 
amusing. Apples, bananas, cake, doughnuts, eggs (deviled), 
fudge, grapes, heart cookies or candy, ice cream, jello, 
kisses, lemonade, marshmallows, nuts, oranges, pickles, 
quince honey, rice balls, sandwiches, tea, unfermented 
grape juice, veal loaf, wafers, yams, zwieback. If it is in- 
convenient to serve the eatables suggested, others may be 
substituted.

Divide the company into four groups—freshmen, sopho- 
mores, juniors, and seniors—using any method of grouping 
desirable, according to month of birth, color of eyes, height, 
ete. Each group then elects a captain and yell leader. Or 
the guests may be assigned to the various groups by the 
Committee on Entrance Examination. Each person, under 
this system, must appear before this committee and answe 
the questions given above, as well as some others that may 
be added at the committee’s discretion regarding age, 
married or single, etc. The assignments of the committee 
are entirely arbitrary and need not be based on the exami- 
nation results. 
Course of Study 
Freshie Glee—Rope-jumping contest. Several ‘fresh- 
men contest to see which can jump the rope the most times 
without missing. Each has a short jumping rope and 
counts as he jumps. 
Sophomore Hop.—Several of this group engage in the 
Chinese Hop Race, described elsewhere in this book. 
Junior Prom.—Heel-and-toe relay race for girls. Several 
girls from this group engage in this race. In taking steps 
the girl must place the foot down so that the heel of her 
front foot touches the toe of her back foot each time. Thus 
she races from the starting line to the goal. 
Senior Bawl.—Representatives from this group put on 
the Baby Marathon Race as described elsewhere in this 
book. Or they may be required to sing at the same time, 
each his own song. The noisiest one wins. 
Spelling Match.—Could be conducted after the fashion 
of the Animated Alphabet Spelling, described elsewhere. 
Representatives from each of the four groups contest.

first. 
Principles of Banking—A representative team from 
each group. They engage in the Penny Relay. 
Target Practice——Throwing peanuts into a jar or vase. 
One contestant from each group. 
Football Game—Form four long lines, one for each 
group, and pass the ball (bean bag will do) back over 
heads of players to end of the line. The last player runs 
to the head of the line with the ball and starts it back 
again, and so on, as in Arch Ball Relay.

“*Give her the gas! No speed limit here!’ 
‘‘Drive your grouch into the garage, and lock the garage.’? 
“*Stop! Look! and Loosen—a Smile!’ 
“Drive slow and see the town! Drive fast and see the graveyard.’’ 
Divide the guests on arrival into several groups, naming 
the groups after well-known makes of automobiles, such as 
Ford, Dodge, Studebaker, Hudson, ete. The number of 
groups will depend on the size of your crowd. With a 
small crowd two groups will be plenty. Let each group 
select a leader and get up a yell to be used during the 
progress of the evening’s fun. Appoint three judges. 
The groups will then engage in the following events: 
1. Assembling the Car.—Each group is given paper and 
pencil and told to make as many words as possible out of 
the word ‘‘automobile,’’ each group making one list for 
the entire group. 
2. Filling the Radiator—aA girl and a boy represent 
each group. They are seated, and the girl gives the boy a 
glass of water, spoonful at a time. 
8. Hanging Up the Side Curtains.—Hang a small picture 
of an auto on the wall. Blind-fold a representative of 
each group and let them pin a small strip of cloth as near 
the auto as possible. The one getting his strip nearest 
right wins. 
4. A Blow-ouwt—One contestant for each car. Have

AN AVIATION MEET 
(First Prize) 
This has been voted to be the best social we ever had. 
It was written by Emily Rose Burt. ‘‘An Aviation Meet’’ 
is the title she gave it. The invitations are made to look 
like tickets of admission, the men’s on red cardboard and 
the girls’ on blue, and read thus: ‘‘Admit two to an 
aviation meet in the church parlors Friday evening [date] 
at eight o’clock.’? Hvery member who receives a ticket 
must make it a point to ask some one else and should con- 
duct the guest personally to the social. 
Decorate as you may choose, but you should have minia- 
ture balloons in the windows and an aéroplane in sight. 
We had one about three or four feet long made up in good 
style. In different places on the walls place conspicuously 
large posters with the program of the events, as follows: 
224
-P-A-G-E-235
PHUNOLOGY 
  1. Tests—Groundwork, control, balance. 
2. Flights. 
3. Stunts and Tricks—Spiral, loop the loop, reverse 
speed, low speed, spin, nose dives, hands up. 
4, Air Races. 
5. Arrival of the Mail. 
To promote fun put up a few placards featuring certain 
well-known members in some of the events. For instance: 
“See Willis Beasley Loop the Loop’’ or ‘‘Francis Cregan’s 
Control Is Wonderful.’’? Call on volunteers to take the 
different stunts. 
The first test, which is called groundwork, is a hopping 
stunt. The contestants hop on one foot to a given goal, 
and the one who does it the most easily and gracefully 
and holds out best is declared victorious by the judges. 
Blue ribbon badges are pinned on the winners. 
Next comes control, which turns out to be facial control 
under difficulty. No matter what funny things the on- 
lookers may say or do, the contestants are to remain per- 
fectly calm and unmoved as they stand in line. 
‘‘Balance’’ proves who can best poise an apple on the 
head and walk across the room. All the ‘‘balancers’’ start 
across the room at the same time, and the first successful 
ones are awarded the blue ribbons. Balancing peanuts on 
a knife blade and carrying them from one end of the room 
to the other is another way to execute the test. 
When it is time for the flights every one is handed a 
paper aviation cap to put on. Then paper and pencils 
are passed to all, and they are invited to take flights of 
fancy. These, it will be explained, may be rhymes, 
romances, or the biggest lies that can be invented. A flight 
of oratory may also be offered. A committee of three 
appointed on the spot promises to report on the winners 
at the close of the evening, but we had the blue ribbons 
awarded as soon as the contest was over. Here was a
-P-A-G-E-236
226 PHUNOLOGY 
  place and time for some long ‘‘ghost’’ stories and the 
like. 
The ‘‘air races’’ are of two sorts: the ‘‘hot-air’’ race 
and the balloon race. In the ‘‘hot-air’’ race the con- 
testants are timed as to the number of words each one 
can say in three minutes with the eyes shut. For the 
balloon race several strings are stretched from one side 
of the room to the other, and the same number of toy 
balloons are supplied. The object is for the contestants 
to blow their respective balloons across the room, follow- 
ing as nearly as possible the courses of strings. The choice 
of different colored balloons makes for interest and con- 
sequent ‘‘rooting.’’ 
The arrival of the mail is heralded by the entrance of 
some one dressed in aviator’s garments—warm helmet, 
goggles, gloves, and all—earrying a mail sack, which, if 
real, should be a new one. An imitation one will do. The 
aviator then proceeds to take out numerous packages which 
he hands to the guests as far as they go. There should be 
at least half as many packages as persons present. Each 
bundle is marked: ‘‘Owner unknown; find another to 
share this.’? The explanation is that each recipient of a 
parcel must immediately seek a partner and, upon finding 
one, open the parcel, finding enough sandwiches for two. 
Meanwhile hot coffee or chocolate is being served by pretty 
waitresses, with Japanese fans stuck in their hair wing- 
wise. 
The evening may end with a ‘‘musical flight,’’ or, in other 
words, a rousing ‘‘sing.’’—Couey-Melton, Sedalia, Mo.

We were to meet at the home of one of our members, 
and imagine our surprise at not finding a car in sight, but 
over the front door a large sign: ‘‘Garage—All Kinds of 
Repairing Done.’’ The interior of the house was changed 
into a true-to-life garage, with old tires, inner tubes, oil 
cans, ete., scattered about, and signs of ‘‘Don’t Smoke. 
If Your Life Isn’t Worth Anything, Gasoline Is,’’ ‘‘Gaso- 
line, 28 Cents per Gallon,’’ and other advertisements of 
auto accessories hanging about the room. Partners were 
found by matching the cut-up halves of automobile pic-

The couple with the largest number of blanks filled 
eorrectly was presented with a glass automobile filled with

The next contest was an automobile puzzle. The crowd 
was divided into groups of six, and the group which first 
finished putting together the many pieces of a eut-up paper 
automobile was given a number of ‘‘extra tires,’’ which 
proved to be a small peppermint ‘‘life-saver.’’

Sides were next chosen for a relay race, the two sides 
racing with two small automobiles attached to a long string. 
Each player had to run the autos around a miniature 
signpost reading: ‘‘Speed limit, sixty miles per hour. 
Go the limit.”’ The winners of this rather hilarious 
race were rewarded with sticks of chewing gum labeled 
‘“‘Hmergency Tire Mender.’’ 
The boys and girls were then sent to the ‘‘Supply 
Station,’’ a corner of the room made into a supply station, 
and were served with ‘‘extra tires’? (doughnuts) and 
**gas’? (lemonade). 
The last number on the program was an ‘‘ Automobile 
Wedding.’’ The blanks were to be filled with the name of 
some car, and the winner in this contest became the proud 
(?) possessor of a most ferocious-sounding horn: 
‘‘An interesting wedding took place last week. The 
bridegroom’s name was Mitchell, and the bride’s name was 
Haines. He proposed by the light of the Moon, and they 
were wed in the palace of a King. The ring was carried 
by a tiny Paige. The bride was gowned in shimmering 
White, and her crown of Auburn hair made her look de- 
cidedly Regal. The groom presented his best man with a 
seven-jewel Waltham, and the bride gave her maid of honor 
a silver-back Brush. They decided to travel Overland 
in their new machine, but they had several mishaps. The 
bridge over the first river had been washed out, so they 
had to Ford. Another time they were almost arrested for 
speeding, but managed to Dodge the officer. The weather 
was Peerless, and they toured the entire Empire, though 
they sometimes had to hire a Pathfinder. When they re- 
turned the King made the bridgegroom Premier of his

NEIGHBORHOOD BIRTHDAY PARTY 
(Third Prize) : 
The invitation reads: 
**T always have wished I’d been born in July 
And doubtless you feel just the same as do I; 
So let’s have a birthday party together, 
Right in the midst of this picnicky weather. 
For the date of your birthday we don’t care a bit; 
But if you are longing to make a great ‘hit,’ 
Wear something that shows just the time and the season 
That you were born in. Be sure ‘there’s a reason.’ 
We don’t ask to know if ’twas night or ’twas morning,’ 
But merely the name of the month you were born in, 
Bring a picture to show how you looked when a baby 
For our great guessing contest. *Twill win a prize—maybe.’’ 
The last two lines refer to a contest in which all these 
baby pictures are entered, the prize going to the person 
who has best kept his or her ‘‘baby looks.’’ 
There will be a great deal of originality in the way in 
which the months are symbolized. Some one may represent 
January by wearing two huge calendars strapped over the 
shoulders after the fashion of the ‘‘sandwich men’’ who 
serve as walking advertisements on city streets, while an- 
other may sew old calendars over her gown in fanciful 
designs. Still a third might typify the month by an arm- 
ful of resolutions which she gives no one because she must 
“keep them.’’ 
One February girl may decorate her white gown with 
lace paper, roses, hearts, and cupids till she looks like a 
living valentine, while a string of paper hearts worn over 
her white dress may be quite as suggestive of the month 
for some one else. 
March might wear a gray Canton flannel hood with 
ears to represent Pussy Willow, who preéminently belongs

to March. Another might bring a toy drum and keep time 
with it while marching around the room. 
April’s child should wear a raincoat, carry an umbrella, 
and make rainbows on the walls by means of a prism. 
A pretty idea for May would be to wear a May basket 
bonnet from which blossoms appear to be falling, though 
they are simply suspended on black threads. 
June, with its brides, its sweet girl graduates and roses, 
| offers endless possibilities. 
July will robe its daughters in the Stars and Stripes. 
August may be represented by means of yellow crépe 
paper hat and collar made like sunflowers, worn with a 
white gown. 
The September woman might become a child again, 
starting to school in her clean gingham apron, with her 
books under her arm. 
Hallowe’en pumpkins, ghosts, and witches could be used 
to symbolize October, while Puritan maids would come in 
for a share of the November honors. 
December, with its icicles, its snow, its Santa Claus, and 
its holly, would suggest a score of ideas. 
A contest would be as follows: 
. What is the most traveled age? (Mileage.) 
. What is the greenest age? (Foliage.) 
What is the most cruel age? (Carnage.) 
. What is the most edible age? (Sausage.) 
What is an age a man dreads? (Mortgage.) 
What is a comfortable age? (Carriage.) 
What is a thieving age? (Pillage.) 
. What is a condescending age? (Patronage.) 
. What is the bravest age? (Courage.)

Each guest might be requested to bring something of

HALLOWE’EN PARTY 
‘All of those invited to the party were asked to come 
masked or dressed in Hallowe’en style, such as witches, 
ghosts, devils, ete. Im addition, several were chosen to 
dress for their particular parts, as they were to be on the 
program. 
The evening’s entertainment centered about four par- 
ticular features. One of these was the devil’s cave. One 
corner of a side room was curtained off so that no outside 
light could get in. On one side of this space was an imita- 
tion fire, with red lights for flames, and this furnished the 
only illumination. About ten persons at a time were ad- 
mitted, and the devil and his imps, suitably garbed, took 
charge. In solemn hushed tones the devil told about see- 
ing a cat killed that afternoon. After reciting all the 
gruesome details he could think of, he said he had brought 
some parts of the said cat for their examination. All of 
this time the imps are uttering weird noises, catealls, ete., 
or anything calculated to get the imagination stirred up. 
Thereupon the devil passes around an old rabbit’s foot, a 
piece of fur, and, last of all, a piece of raw liver. It is 
necessary to keep this piece of liver moving, or some one 
will drop it. Believe me, it certainly produces a genuine 
Hallowe’en atmosphere, especially among the girls present! 
Another stunt is to hang a sheet over an open doorway, 
leaving a small opening about the height of the chest. 
Every one is invited to come and shake hands with
-P-A-G-E-243
  
PHUNOLOGY 233 
‘‘Napoleon.’’ Some one is stationed behind the sheet with 
an undressed kid glove filled with meal or any other mushy 
substance. The glove should be dipped in ice-cold water, 
and when the victim puts his or her hand through the 
opening the cold glove is put in the palm. You have to 
watch to see that the glove is not snatched away during 
the shaking. 
Then the conventional witch’s caldron is used, with the 
witches dancing about it, singing a ghost song without 
accompaniment. 
One very amusing feature was three or four young men 
dressed as black cats, who circulated about among the 
guests, on all fours, meowing and occasionally getting to- 
gether for a regular cat fight. They provoked a regular 
gale of laughter over their antics, getting in their good 
work whenever a lull threatened. 
The decorations consisted of stacks of cornstalks, with 
imitation pumpkin heads inserted near the tops of the 
stalks, illuminated by red lamps. All around the walls 
were strings of black paper ghosts, goblins, cats, witches, 
ete. No bright lights are used, the ghostly effect being 
maintained throughout. The shocks of cornstalks provide 
places for the cats and witches to circulate about, appear- 
ing and disappearing unexpectedly from time to time. 
The refreshments consisted of apples, pumpkin pie, and 
coffee. 
In order to make the different stunts effective, a great 
deal of work is necessary in getting the room decorated 
properly. Under bright lights and with no special setting, 
it would be almost impossible to create the proper at- 
mosphere for enjoying the Hallowe’en entertainment. The 
cats kept the crowd stirred up and moving about in the 
intervals between the other stunts. 
After the refreshments were served, every one gathered 
around the witch’s caldron, and they told ghost stories.

A CHRISTMAS PARTY 
Our Christmas party contained some features not ordi- 
narily used and which might be of interest. A special 
effort was made to get all of the members out that evening. 
The choice of escorts for the young ladies was not left to 
the discretion of the young men, as some of the ladies 
might have been neglected. The Sunday before the party 4 
couples were paired off, and those who had not met each 
other beforehand were introduced to each other. This 
not only insured the maximum of attendance, but it also 
brought out more bashful swains who had never mustered 
up nerve enough before to make a date with a young lady, 
and also brought out some young ladies who might not 
otherwise have had a chance. With a little diplomacy and 
considerable urging, nearly every one invited showed up. 
Every one present was provided with a gift. Announce- 
ment was made that all should bring at least two presents, 
not to exceed fifteen cents each, one of which was to be 
given to each one’s partner. Whistles were in abundance, 
as well as toys of an amusing nature. 
First on the program came readings and vocal and in- 
strumental numbers, featuring Henry van Dyke’s ‘‘The 
Other Wise Man.’’ 
Long streamers of red and green crépe paper were hung 
across the room. On one side was the Christmas tree, with 
its load of decorations and gifts. On the other side was 
an illuminated cross, wrapped in cotton and sprinkled with 
imitation snow, bringing in the thought of sacrifice along 
with the other impressions of the Christmastide.

  PHUNOLOGY 235 
Laughter and jokes, usually with a personal flavor, using 
local celebrities known to the group as the butt, featured 
the evening, and in the midst of it all came Santa Claus, 
distributing the presents, which had previously been tagged. 
Quite a number of our older friends were present, and 
not one was overlooked. After the presents had been dis- 
tributed, every one was given a small stocking full of nuts 
and candy. For a while it sounded as if Bedlam had 
broken loose as all those who had received whistles or horns 
formed an impromptu parade about the room, using their 
noise-provoking instruments to the limit. Refreshments 
of hot chocolate and cake were served, and after a season 
of good fellowship and Christmas greetings the party 
broke up. 
This party was a success for two principal reasons. First, 
pairing off the couples as we did insured the maximum of 
attendance; and, second, every one present was remem- 
bered with a present.—J. W. Thorne. 
  
A MAD MARCH PARTY 
On the fifteenth of March there was great excitement 
among the boys and girls in our town, those of them who 
were club members feeling quite superior and honored and 
the others feeling quite the opposite. Very unique in- 
vitations had been received by the fortunate young people, 
which read something like this: 
““Tf you’re feeling right bad, 
We’ll make you quite glad

The ‘‘breezy’’ effect was increased by the appearance of 
the invitations, for they were written on pink wrapping 
paper, tied with blue twine, and the words arranged in 
all sorts of wild shapes and places, giving it a regular 
Chinese puzzle effect. 
As a consequence of this unique starter the guests arrived 
on Friday night with the thrill that foretells a jolly time, 
and they were not disappointed. 
The first stunt was a Mad March by all the guests, which 
was really a Grand March Backward, with the folks run- 
ning instead of walking. The ‘‘windy’’ and ‘‘mad’’ idea 
was earried through the whole evening in all the games 
and the serving of the refreshments. In one of the games 
four big balloons were tossed up between two long rows of 
seated guests, and they were to keep them high and knock 
them back and forth, but they could not rise or use their 
right hands. Other ‘‘rowdy’’ games were played, such as 
“London Bridge’’ and ‘‘Drop the Handkerchief,’’ carry- 
ing the guests back to grammar school days, and the 
“‘gales’’ of laughter that ensued were as gay and refresh- 
ing as any breeze that ever blew from the cave of the 
winds. 
When the fun was at its height the entertainment com- 
mittee issued from the kitchen, walking backward and 
holding out behind them plates of delicious ice cream. Oat- 
meal cookies were served on inverted plates and the guests 
required to take them by turning backward and reaching 
out behind them. 
On the whole this ‘‘stormy’’ little affair was a ‘‘howling’’ 
success.—Catherine Waterfield, Brownsville, Tenn.

A STREET FAIR 
“Big Street Fair Tuesday night at eight-thirty o’clock. 
Only masqueraders admitted. Come one, come all. Ad- 
mission free. Under auspices of (name of organization).”’ 
The above notice was printed on large placards and 
placed, several days before the date of the fair, in con- 
venient places. In addition to this, numbers of circulars 
were sent to the members of the organization urging them 
to come and bring their friends. 
Although the placards stated that admission was free, 
a small charge was made at the door, that of registering 
with the left hand in a small book on numbered lines. 
Those fortunate enough to put their names on a blank line 
were exempt from having a prank played on them during 
the course of the evening. Just inside the door was a little 
boy selling confetti for a big grin, while the guests’ left 
hands were tied up in paper bags and the proclamation 
issued that the person who shook hands with the greatest 
number, but whose bag was in the best condition at the 
close of the festival, would receive a prize, which turned 
out to be a huge bag of cotton candy. : 
The ‘‘street’? was the basement of our church, which is 
rather large and has one side made up of small partitioned 
spaces which served well for open booths, and some were 
curtained for the side shows. The fat and lean women, 
the ‘‘wonderful little animal, tail where its head ought to 
be’’ (a tiny toy cat with its tail in a saucer of milk) the 
angler’s luck (fishing for your future), Hawaiian music 
hut (girls and boys with guitars, mandolins, etc.), gypsy 
fortune tent, and the trip to Mars were all represented. 
The last-named feature proved to be one of the most amus- 
ing. The travelers were blindfolded and given a lunch 
which contained cooked worms (boiled macaroni), which 
they were compelled to cat. Along the route they were

rocked and turned about in chairs, swung in swings, made 
to climb out of a window, walk through a narrow pass, 
climb a ladder, and come down a slide, arranged from a 
rather tall window, back into the building. The refresh- 
ment stands, at which pink lemonade, pop corn, apples, 
ginger cookies, and peanuts were served, proved very 
popular, while the auto races drew large crowds. Pictures 
of seven of the best-known cars were given to seven drivers, 
who chose from among the crowd those who should be 
boosters for the different cars. First, the gasoline tank 
had to be filled. Each driver was given a glass of water, 
and the one who succeeded in drinking his first won a 
point for his car. Next, the seven drivers with their 
boosters staged a relay race. Lastly came the blowout. 
Each driver was given a jar filled with feathers and told 
to blow them out when the signal was given, and the one 
succeeding in blowing all the feathers out first and yelling 
the name of his car gained a point for his car. When the 
points were counted and the successful driver decided upon, 
he was awarded a toy automobile. Be sure there is a Ford 
in the race, for in most cases the little Ford wins out—Lila

A NOVEL CAN SOCIAL 
Almost every district has among its benevolences an 
orphanage to support. Here is a novel social plan by which 
a society may have an evening of fun and also render a 
service to the orphanage. 
Advertise this as a ‘‘Can Social.’’ Have the invitations 
pasted on cans of condensed milk and ask all guests to 
bring the cans with them when they come. They can then 
be sent with the other contributions. If this is too ex- 
pensive, use folders having on the cover a drawing of a 
ean. Let the invitations read: ‘‘Said a canny young

one can of fruit. All fruit will be sent to the orphanage.’’ 
At one end of the room have a large picture of a dog. 
Let the guests pin a paper can on the dog’s tail. 
For the next game place the guests in two long rows of 
chairs after they have chosen sides. Pass pencils and 
papers having written upon them the following contest. 
(Announce ahead that the winner on each side—the one 
having the largest number of correct answers—will be

A HOBO PARTY 
The following invitation was written with red pencil on 
brown paper with ragged edges: ‘‘Call at ——, back door, 
at eight o’clock for a ‘hand-out.’ There’ll be other tramps 
and the way clear of ‘cops’ till ten-thirty. (Signed). 
Social Committee.’’ 
As the guests arrived they sat around a fire near the 
side gate in the alley. The occasion was the annual re- 
union of ‘‘tramps.’’ The leader called for a report from 
last year’s make-believe meeting. This report contained 
thrilling experiences of different ‘‘tramps’’ that had been 
sent into the secretary during the year. Then all the 
‘“tramps’’ were given an opportunity to relate any re- 
markable, thrilling, or sad experience they had had. 
New rules governing ‘‘hobos’’ were then adopted. A 
tried and trusted ‘‘hobo’’ was sent to see what could be 
found to eat in this house. A favorable report being made, 
all the ‘‘tramps’’ came, and each was given a paper bag 
containing a sandwich and told to go to Mrs. Brown’s back 
door, quite a good walk in the opposite direction; there 
each was given a paper basket containing salad and a

they spread and ate their lunches undisturbed by ‘‘cops”’ 
till just at ten-thirty, whem they suddenly appeared on 
the scene, and the ‘‘tramps?’ were made to ‘‘move on.’’—

‘AN INDOOR CAMPING PARTY 
One Sunday night at the close of the devotional services 
it was announced that on the following Thursday the 
League would entertain all the young folks of the Church 
in the church parlors (Sunday school rooms). The girls 
were requested to wear skirts and middy blouses and the 
boys khaki if they owned ‘any. Each person was requested 
to bring one ten-cent box of marshmallows. 
When they arrived they found the floor of one room 
covered with clean dry leaves and all rooms trimmed with 
green boughs. The rooms were lighted with lanterns, the 
plain workaday kind, and candles stuck into potatoes hol- 
lowed on one side and flattened on the other. 
When all had arrived it was announced that the first 
game was to be the old but jolly game of ‘‘Simon Says 
Wig-Wag.’’ All were seated in a circlo, and one person 
was chosen as leader. As soon as the interest in this began 
to lag it was announced that next there would be a hunt. 
The doors to the next room were now opened, and the 
region proved to be astonishingly rich in game, considering 
the nature of the surroundings. In the corner of the room 
stood an easel, which supported a wide pine board on which 
had been fastened small pictures of all sorts of birds and 
animals, from sparrow to elephant and anteater. The 
weapon was an air gun, the missile a small dart. Hach 
guest was permitted to choose the beast at which he or
-P-A-G-E-252

she desired to shoot. We were informed that each animal 
represented a number of score marks printed on the back 
of the card. Naturally, therefore, the guests shot at the 
big game, such as the elephant, but when the cards were 
removed they found that the elephant counted only one, 
while the sparrow was good for twenty-five. 
Before the games started the boys wrote their names 
on one piece of paper and the girls on another, and then 
all the boxes of marshmallows were collected. 
After the hunting was over it was announced that next 
we should go fishing, but only the girls were to be allowed 
to fish. Every one returned to the room covered with 
leaves, and there found a big washtub covered with a large 
piece of cardboard, in the center of which was a hole just 
big enough to pass the hand through. Each girl reached 
through the hole and got one box of marshmallows, on 
which a boy’s name had been written. As soon as she 
found her partner in this way they were ushered into the 
yard back of the church, where they found a large bed 
of wood coals. Around this all gathered and with long 
pointed sticks toasted and ate marshmallows. A number 
of those present told short tales appropriate to the occasion 
as we toasted marshmallows.—Elsie Denison, Waco, Tex. 
  
A COB SOCIAL 
(A social at which forty-five people were entertained at 
a cost of seventy-five cents.) 
The invitations should be worded: ‘‘To meet Mr. and 
Mrs. Cobb Tuesday evening at eight o’clock. Please present 
at the door an apple or a corncob.”’ 
Have some one at the door to receive the cobs, but let 
each guest retain the apple. The first game is called 
“Swapping Apples.’’ It is the old ‘‘Yes and No’’ game
-P-A-G-E-253
  PHUNOLOGY 243 
changed for the occasion. Each one tries to ask questions 
of all he meets; if the answer given is ‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No,’’ 
the one who answers must forfeit an apple. The object 
of the game, of course, is to see who can obtain the most 
apples. 
For the next contest choose sides. Let each side choose 
two candidates. Have suspended from the ceiling a stiff 
piece of cardboard, in the center of which is an oblong hole. 
Let a person stand on each side of the cardboard and steady 
it. Break cobs into three pieces each. Give each par- 
ticipant three pieces of cob. Let them toe the mark and 
in turn try to throw the cobs through the hole. Hach 
person gets three shots, and each team gets three attempts. 
Have a scorekeeper keep track of the points. 
If the crowd is small, play cob-and-apple croquet. Lay 
off on the floor, in regular croquet style, a court, using cobs 
laid flat on the floor for arches, apples for balls, and lath 
or any even-sized sticks for mallets. Let each side enter 
one team and let them play regular croquet. For each 
arch have two cobs laid side by side, but far enough apart 
for an apple to be rolled through. The apple must not 
displace a single cob. This is a difficult though dandy 
game. 
Have prepared beforehand some cobs to which have been 
tacked flat cardboards or anything that will cause the cobs 
to stand upright. Arrange them like nine pins and play 
with the apples for balls. Have each side choose several 
boys. Give each boy a cob, an apple (if his has mysteriously 
disappeared in the meantime), some pins, one piece of 
erépe paper, and one paper napkin. Have handy a pot of 
paste and a pair of scissors. Let each boy dress a doll, 
using the apple for the head, the cob for the body, and the 
paper, ete., for the clothes. To the one who finishes first 
and has the best doll present a cob doll made by the com- 
mittee. For the booby prize wrap up in tissue paper an
-P-A-G-E-254
  244 PHUNOLOGY 
apple core and tie it with ribbons. This contest is espe- 
cially funny. 
For another game have the two sides seated in two long 
lines, if possible. Have the first one on one side start a 
story, at the same time peeling the apple. When the apple 
is peeled, the first one on the other side must start his 
apple and take up the story and go on with it. One side 
tries to prevent the couple in the story from marrying; 
the other side tries to get them married off. The rules are 
that the marriage must not come off without a three 
months’ notice, and sudden death or sickness is prohibited. 
This is one of the most interesting and lively games I have 
ever played. The situations through which the poor couple 
must be taken are very funny. The couple meet only to 
be parted cruelly by some unsympathetic member of the

peeling. The romance usually terminates in a happy mar- 
riage or else on the scaffold, according to which side has the 
last word. 
For refreshments pass apples and fresh pop corn. 
On leaving, each guest expressed his appreciation of the 
evening’s entertainment to two members of the committee 
representing Mr. and Mrs. Cobb. This has proved to be a 
truly successful social. It was given at a total expense of 
seventy-five cents, and forty-five guests pronounced it the 
“best ever.’’ It is essentially a Corn Belt social, but most 
towns of the South and central States are plentifully sup- 
plied with apple and cob bins, and this social was planned 
to demonstrate that one may have a good time anywhere 
with materials that are close at hand, though often simple 
and inexpensive. Try this and see if it does not ‘‘fill the 
bill.’—Mrs. S. M. Laws.

A QUIET PROGRAM 
At this social the young people of the Church invited 
their mothers, fathers, and friends to come out. First we 
had introductions. Then the following verses were read, 
and as each was read it was at once responded to by the 
one to whom it had been given several days beforehand to 
prepare on. 
1. Though puzzles do our minds distress, 
‘We'd like several good ones now to guess. 
(Use tact and get several good ones at this. Have about 
four. Not too many of any one thing so as to lose ‘‘pep.’’) 
2. We'd like to hear you tell to-day 
Some funny things that children say. 
(I appointed two old maids for this. Use original sayings, 
if possible.) 
3. Describe some woman in the town, 
Her nose and hair, her dress and gown; 
But do not give us her address, 
Nor tell her name, and we will guess. 
(This was given to a girl who carried it out in poetry. 
Some excited guessing took place.) 
4. ‘We’d like a story full of fun: 
You’re gifted; tell us one. 
(Choose a person who can do things and keep interest. 
There is usually such a one in every society.)

5. Misery likes company, they say; 
We'd like to hear you tell to-day. 
Don’t hesitate, but now begin, 
Of the worst serape you ever were in. 
(Some school or college prank may be told here.) 
6. Your talent gives us much delight; 
We wish that you would please recite. 
(Some Junior is good for this.) 
7. Your part in this program to help ts along 
Will give us much pleasure; please sing us a song. 
(Some one who can sing.) 
8. If music hath charms, we wish that to-day 
You’d prove it, and something quite charming would 
play. 
(Any sort of instrument. Boys, if possible.) 
9. Tell some joke on yourself, your wife, or friend, 
But we hope that you’ll have it pleasantly end. 
(Our pastor told one on his wife.) 
10. Describe some trip you’ve taken afar, 
To Mexico, Europe, or Zanzibar. 
(Given to one who had taken a summer auto trip to 
Colorado.) 
11. Give a tale of old time when settlers were few, 
Of what they had then and what they did do. 
(Given to oldest ones present.)

12. Describe some famous picture, 
Whether dark or fair. 
Please tell us all about it 
And the artist rare. 
(We used the spirit of ’76.) 
13. Without a bit of gossip sweet, 
This program would not be complete. 
Be sure that while the seasons roll 
This crowd will never tell a soul. 
(For this we had a paper written by some person full of 
jokes and so on of each and every person present. It was 
a real treat and caused lots of laughter.) 
If this is carried out, it will occupy at least two hours’ 
time. Then we served light refreshments of chocolate and 
cake. All stood and joined in singing ‘‘God be with you 
till we meet again’’ and were dismissed with our League 
benediction. This we found was a good way to entertain 
our parents. We must not forget them. Let us plan 
more socials for them also.—Louise Schlipf, Katy, Tex.

A TRIP TO THE SOUTH POLE 
The above is the name we gave to a little social we had 
which proved to be very helpful as well as entertaining. 
Announcement was made at the Sunday school services, 
and the young folks were requested to bring their wraps. 
No further description was given as to the kind of social 
we were to have. 
We met at the church in the evening at 7:30, and at 
7:45 we were notified over the telephone to go to a certain 
place five or six blocks from the church. We all went to 
the given address, and at that place the leader of the group 
received orders where to go next, and this continued from 
place to place until we liad gone possibly a mile and a 
half, where the group was stopped at the home of one 
of the members, where seats were arranged for all. 
The group was notified that this was only the halfway 
house and that we stopped here for a short business meet- 
ing and rest. This proved to be very opportune, as we had 
quite a large number present, more than if we had only 
announced a business meeting. 
After the meeting the group departed, with orders to 
go several blocks, and in the final wind-up found them- 
selves in the back yard of the place we had just left, where 
we had the business meeting. We found a nice big fire, 
seats all around, with boards on the ground to protect the

feet, electric lights in the yard provided by use of exten- 
sion cords, a dining table with wieners, buns, pickles, and 
marshmallows. Sticks had been cut and sharpened to do 
the roasting, and there by the warm fire we roasted the 
wieners and marshmallows and told ghost stories. 
The place above referred to was in the city, and the fact 
was established that you can have a wiener roast and a nice 
time with it, without having to go to the country to do so. 
The company left about ten o’clock, saying it was one of 
the best socials they had ever attended.—Couey-Melton, 
Sedalia, Mo. 
A GRAPHOPHONE SOCIAL 
The above is the title of a very unique and original 
social given by our young people. 
We had a large victrola box and took off one side and 
one end. We stood the box up on one end in the League 
room in a place which could be hid by a curtain. We 
placed a primary chair in this box on the floor, and the 
records consisted of human beings. We had an improvised 
crank to wind the machine after each ‘‘record,’’ and when 
we changed the records we pulled the curtain to allow the 
“‘records’’ to get out and another to get in place. 
The entertainment consisted of singing, stories, and reci- 
tation. One of the numbers was ‘‘Levinsky at the Wed- 
ding,’’ recited by one of the young men; another, ‘‘Cohen 
at the Phone,”’ by a lady, ete. 
The entertainment lasted about an hour, after which 
refreshments were served. 
Of course the above entertainment could just as well have 
been given without the improvised talking machine, but it 
was something different and made quite a hit—Couey- 
Melton, Sedalia, Mo.

THe Excursion 
To each person give a typewritten copy of the following 
ticket, with the names of the towns omitted: 
“The Funville, Frolictown, and Featherbrain Railroad 
Central Station [name of your town], U. S. A. Excursion

eggshell marked ‘‘Something easy to crack’’ could be given 
as a booby prize. 
Immediately following the excursion trip announce the 
names of two members of the party who have reached their 
destination. They are to pass singly before the crowd, with 
suit-case in hand. Suddenly the lady stops to inspect her 
suit-case. Purposely, suit-cases have been exchanged. She 
opens the case and pulls forth, for all to see, a pair of 
trousers, collar, tie, large shoe, ete. Then after passing. 
off the stage the man inspects his case, and, much to the 
enjoyment of lookers on, he finds a lady’s handsome skirt, 
powder, mirrors, etc. Both seem very much perturbed as 
they pass out. This will make a most enjoyable evening of 
fun.—Catherine Stricklin, St. Elmo, Tenn.   
AUCTION

each box look attractive. Charge an admission fee of ten

each, after he has paid the ten cents. After the company 
has assembled, the auctioneer, who must be quick and 
witty, auctions the boxes to the ones bidding the highest 
number of beans. No one is allowed to bid more beans 
than he has in his sack.—Catherine Stricklin. 
  
MIMEOGRAPH SOCTAL 
A social especially for members of the organization. Give 
each member present a mimeograph copy of list of members. 
A reception committee, wearing rosettes of the organiza- 
tion’s colors, make it their duty to introduce members. As 
soon as two members meet, each scratches the other’s name 
off. The one who meets the largest number receives a prize. 
This is interesting and aids in breaking the ice.—Catherine 
Stricklin. 
  
RAILROAD TRIP OVER GEORGIA 
When the Leaguers came they had to go the ticket office, 
and there they were given a ticket to some place in Georgia. 
There were two to each place, one for the man and one 
for the lady. Then they went into the waiting room. When 
almost all had come we let them into the train, which was 
made -of two long rows of chairs, two together, and an 
aisle in the middle. We had a bell cord and conductor. 
When he pulled the cord and called the station the boys 
moved up one seat and so changed partners. The porter 
was very much in evidence with his whisk broom, ete. The

  CHAPTER XV1 
GAMES ARRANGED FROM A TO Z 
ADVICE GRATIS 
Each player is provided with a slip of paper on which 
he is to write a bit of advice, original or otherwise, humor- 
ous or serious. Papers are folded, put in a hat, and shaken 
up. Each person takes one. Before unfolding it to read 
to the crowd, the players must say whether the advice is 
good or bad, uncalled for or timely, unnecessary, ete. As 
they have not seen it, amusing situations may result, as 
you can well imagine. For instance, Miss Jones says that 
hers is ‘‘exactly the thing.’’ She then opens and reads: 
“Don’t propose to every man you meet.’’ 
AN APPLE RACE 
Contestants line up at starting point, each with an 
apple balanced on his head. At the signal they start for 
the goal, no use of the hands being allowed to keep the 
apple in place. If the apple falls from the head, con- 
testant must pick it up, go back to the starting point, and 
start over. The winner is the person who first carries the 
apple the whole distance without its falling off his head) It 
is well in this contest for the contestant to remember and 
heed the old proverb that ‘‘haste makes waste.’’

AMERICA 
Have entire company sing ‘‘America,’’? dropping every 
fourth word, thus: 
  
“«My country, ’tis thee, 
Sweet land liberty.’’   
Players who make mistakes drop out. A large company 
could be divided into groups and have the groups contest 
to see which can ‘‘put it across’’ in the best style. 
ANIMATE ALPHABET SPELL 
  Two complete sets of cardboard letters about nine inches 
high, one in blue and one in white, will be necessary. The 
company is divided into two groups and line up facing 
one another, there being one person for each letter in each 
group. The leader calls a word to be spelled, and the 
players having the letters included arrange themselves in 
front of their lines. The side first spelling the word gets 
one point. When a double letter occurs, the player with 
that letter must move it pendulum-like back and forth to 
indicate the fact. If the letter occurs twice, the person 
must appear where it comes first, then rush to the next 
place and stand. It is possible, of course, to increase the 
number taking part by giving out additional letters, just 
so each side has the same number of each particular letter. 
In this case, when a letter occurs twice in a word, both 
persons holding that letter must appear in proper place.

Miser ANCIENT MARINER 
All of the players except one stand in a line. The one 
who is the ancient mariner totters up to one of the players 
in the funniest manner possible, saying: 
‘*Here comes an ancient mariner from Botany Bay. 
Pray, what have you got to give him to-day?’’ 
all the time going through all kinds of antics to make the 
player laugh. The player must then say what she will give 
him, but in doing so must not laugh nor use the words 
“*yes,’’ ‘‘no,”’ ‘‘black,’’ ‘‘white,’’ ‘‘searlet.’? The mariner’s 
object is to try to coax one of these words out of the player 
or make her laugh, and he may ask any question he likes 
in order to do so. Forfeits may be taken if he succeeds. 
  
ict oy We 
The players sit in a circle, and the one designated begins 
to count, his next neighbor says the next number, and so 
on around the circle until ‘‘seven’’ is reached, when, in- 
stead of giving that number, the player says ‘‘Buzz.’’ The 
next player says ‘‘Hight,’’ and so on until ‘‘fourteen’’ is 
reached, when again ‘‘buzz’’ must be given instead of the 
number. Thus for every number having a seven or a 
multiple of seven.the word ‘‘buzz’’ must be substituted. 
The players who fail to do this must drop out or pay a 
forfeit, whichever has been decided.

one who captures him. In a large crowd two or more bell 
ringers may be used. 
N IZ« 
Pre-party BEAN QU When the company begins to arrive give each person ten 
beans, with instructions as to how to proceed. Whenever 
you trip some one into answering some questions by say- 
ing ‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No,’’ that person surrenders to you one 
bean. If you are caught, you forfeit one bean to the one 
catching you. This contest may run through the whole 
evening’s entertainment, and at the close the winner would 
be the person holding the largest number of beans. 
  
BLACK AND WHITE TAG 
One player is leader, the rest being divided into two sides, 
the Blacks and the Whites. All Whites indicate the fact 
by tying a handkerchief on the left arm. The rest are 
Blacks, Players stand around the floor promiscuously, 
Blacks and Whites mixed. The leader has a disk, white on 
one side, black on the other. Standing on a chair, he 
twirls this on a short string, stopping it with one side only 
visible to the players, who are directly in front of him. 
If the black side shows, all Whites must drop immediately 
to the floor as in Stoop Tag, the Blacks being privileged to 
tag all players in erect position. If the white side shows, 
the Whites are taggers and the Blacks must stoop. Play- 
ers drop out as they are tagged. The side tagging all of 
its opponents wins. The leader should keep the game mov- 
ing briskly by twirling the tag rapidly.

Players seat themselves in a circle. One player stands 
in the center, and, suddenly pointing to some player, shouts, 
“Bird, fish, or animal,’’ then the name of one of these 
classes, and immediately begins counting to ten. The 
player to whom he points must name some bird, fish, or 
animal, according to the class designated by the caller, be- 
fore he can count ten. Thus the caller shouts, ‘‘Bird, fish, 
or animal. Bird!’’? The player to whom he points must 
name some bird before he counts to ten. Should he fail, 
he must take the caller’s place. Repetition of anything 
previously named is not allowable. The use of the word 
“‘cat’’ is barred.

* BURYING UNCLE NED 
Have girls line up on one side and boys on the other, 
facing one another and some six feet apart. The boy at 
one end begins the game by saying to his neighbor: ‘‘Did 
you know Uncle Ned was dead?’’ ‘‘No; how did he die?”’ 
‘‘By closing his eye.’’ He closes one eye, keeping it closed 
while the performance goes on down the line, across to 
the girls’ line, and to the end of it. Then he begins again 
by asking the same question: ‘‘Did you know Uncle Ned 
was dead?’’ ‘‘No; how did he die?’’ ‘‘By closing his 
eye, with his face awry.’’ The third time it goes around 
he says: ‘‘By closing his eye, with his face awry, and foot 
up high.’’? The fourth time he adds: ‘‘And waving good- 
by.’’ Hach time the additional grimace, posture, or motion 
is assumed and kept to the end. When the fourth round 
is completed the leader shouts, ‘‘He’s buried!’’ and all 
assume a normal attitude. 
  
“BUZZ”? BASEBALL 
Just as in the regular game, there are nine on either side. 
The side at the bat sits in a straight line over on the side. 
The other side take the field, arranging themselves in 
proper position, catcher, pitcher, ete. The distance be- 
tween the bases need be only a few feet. One of the players © 
on the ‘‘bench’’ takes his place at the ‘‘plate,’’ and the 
opposing pitcher calls out a number—for instance, ‘‘two’’ 
—which becomes the buzz number. The batter calls ‘‘One,”’ 
the end man on his side calls ‘‘Buzz,’’ the next ‘‘Three,’’ 
then ‘‘Buzz,’’ and so on down the line. Then it is taken 
up by the players in the field, providing no mistake has 
been made. ‘The catcher calls ‘‘Buzz,’’? the pitcher 
‘‘Bleven,’’ etc. It’s the old game of Buzz, as you can see. 
If the side at the bat makes a mistake, the batter is out,
-P-A-G-E-272
  262 PHUNOLOGY 
and another man steps up to the ‘‘plate,’’ and so on until 
three men are out, when the team in the field takes its 
turn at the bat, the other team taking the field. If the 
team in the field fails to ‘‘buzz’’ in the proper place, the 
batter takes one base for each mistake made by it. The 
next batter then steps up. The runner may score only 
when forced around by succeeding batters becoming base 
runners. Of course, if a batter has made a three-base hit 
and the man following him gets a one-base hit, the player 
on third may score. If no mistake is made by either side, 
and the ‘‘buzz’’ goes all the way round, the batter is out. 
Players must count rapidly so as not to make the game 
drag. The umpire may allow a batter a base if there is 
unnecessary delay on the part of the team in the field. On 
the other hand, he may call the batter out for unnecessary 
slowness on the part of the team at the bat. The umpire 
should keep the game moving rapidly. 
  
BARNYARD 
Have every one seated and let the leader announce that 
you will play ‘‘Barnyard.’’ To do this everybody must 
imitate some barnyard animal or fowl, as directed by the 
leader. He then goes to each one and whispers ‘‘Be quiet,’’ 
excepting one, whom he tells to bray like a donkey or 
crow like a rooster. The signal is then given for all to 
act the parts assigned them, and the donkey will bray, per- 
haps, much to his own confusion and to every one else’s 
delight. A very good-natured person must be selected. 
Under no circumstances select any one whose feelings will 
likely be hurt. We have a distinct recollection to this day 
of one young lady who was deeply wounded by being fooled 
in this performance. If you haven’t some one who would 
enjoy it with the rest of the crowd, don’t use it at all. 
None of our fun should leave any one unhappy.

BLIND SWAT 
Select two boys as contestants. Each is blindfolded and 
handed a roll of newspaper to use as a swatter. They lie 
face down on the floor take hold of left hands, and take 
turns in attempting to swat one another. They may squirm 
around in any position desired to fool the opponent, but 
must not unclasp left hands during the ‘‘swatting bee.”’ 
The one making the most ‘‘hits’’ out of a certain number 
of trials wins. 
  
SbOTTLE AND HANDKERCHIEF SWIPE 
The company is divided into two equal sides. They line 
up on opposite sides of the room, facing one another. A 
long-necked bottle is placed upright on the floor midway 
between the two lines of players, and on it is placed a 
handkerehief. At the given signal the two opposing 
players at the left end of each line rush toward the bottle. 
The first one to the bottle snatches the handkerchief and 
rushes back to his place; with the opposing player in pur- 
suit. Should he be tagged before reaching his line, he is 
captured and must take a place on the opposing side. 
Should he reach home safely, the pursuing player becomes 
captive and joins the side of the player pursued. Should 
the player snatching the handkerchief upset the bottle, he 
is considered as captured. If the players reach the bottle 
about the same time, they may ‘‘fiddle’’ around, sparring 
for a good chance to snatch the handkerchief and make a 
get-away, keeping an eye open for the moment when the 
opponent is off guard, feinting at snatching the handker- 
chief several times before finally taking ‘it, ete. This would 
make a good out-of-doors game for picnic and summer 
assembly occasions.

BLIND MAN’S BARNYARD 
The person who is ‘‘It’’ is blindfolded and given a stick. 
A The players form a circle about him. The blind man goes 
about the circle and with his wand points to some one. 
This person must take the end of the wand in his hand 
and do as the blind man directs. The object of the blind 
man is to recognize by the voice who is at the other end 
of the wand. He says, ‘‘Grunt, pig, grunt,’’ or ‘‘Crow, 
cock, crow,’’ or ‘‘Bray, donkey, bray,’’ ete. If the blind 
man recognizes the voice and names the possessor of that 
voice, that person takes the blind man’s place. 
  
BASEBALL GAME 
A disk of some sort is used. A flat stone would do. 
Mark off a diamond twenty-four inches square, as shown 
in the cut, blocked off into sixteen small squares. Divide 
the crowd into two sides. Each side selects a captain and 
team to represent it in the contest. Those not on the team 
form a rooters’ club. The diamond may be marked off 
on the floor, ground, or sand. The batter stands ten feet 
away from the apex of the diamond to toss the disk, which 
must be clearly within the lines of one of the small squares 
to count. If it touches a line or is outside the diamond, 
the umpire declares it a ‘‘foul ball’’ and the player throws 
again. Three fouls put a player out. Besides the umpire, 
a scorer must also be appointed. Each team retains its 
turn at the bat until three ‘‘outs’’ have been made. Five- 
inning games may be played. 
1. Sacrifice hit. Batter out. Runners on base advance 
one base. (Runners on bases may be indicated by pieces 
of paper.) If no runners happen to ie on base, the batter 
bunts and is thrown out at first. 
2. Hit by pitcher. Go to first.

ew M EE, PERS, CANE CATCH = CANE 
This is a variation of ‘‘Spin the Plate.’’ Just as in that 
game, you number the players. Players sit in a circle. One 
player in the center stands with index finger on a cane or 
umbrella, which stands perpendicular to the floor. Sud- 
denly he lifts his finger and calls a number. The person 
whose number is called must catch the cane before it falls 
to the floor or pay a forfeit. He then takes charge of the 
eane and calls some other number, and so on.

CUSHION SCRAMBLE ) 
The company is divided into two sides. They face each 
other, join hands, and skip around a sofa pillow, which is 
in the center of the circle. Finally one side endeavors to 
pull the other side forward so as to make one of their 
adversaries touch the cushion. The merry scrimmage con- 
tinues until some one touches the pillow. This person must 
then drop out, and the game proceeds until one side is 
eliminated. Contestants avoid the cushion by hopping, 
drawing back, side-stepping, ete. 
  
COUNTING OFF COUPLETS

CHARADES 
Divide into sides and let each side represent in pan- 
tomime and dialogue the words to be guessed, telling the 
guessing side how many syllables are in the word repre- 
sented. For instance, it is announced that the word is 
one of three syllables. Two of the players appear before 
the guessers, meet and cordially greet one another as 
“Doe.’’ Some one will probably guess ‘‘Paradox’’ (Pair- 
o’-docs). A point may be awarded when a side fails to 
guess and has to give up. The following words are a few 
that may be used: Moonshine, parapet, ragamuffin, Con- 
cord, strawberries, Panama, woman (woe-man), ingratiate 
(in-gray-she-ate), cootie (coo like a dove—T, form letter), 
antarctic (aunt-ark-tick), buccaneer (buck-can-ear), hand- 
kerchief (hand-cur-chief), pilgrimage (pill-grim-age), sau- 
sage (saw-sage), aéroplane (air-o-plane), missionary (miss- 
shun-airy), anti-climax (aunty-climb-axe), billboard, hand- 
out (only a hand sticking out from under cover), penitent 
(pen-eye-tent), mad-cap, infancy (inn-fan-sea). 
  
CONSEQUENCES 
Three appointed persons pass around the company 
whispering in each ear. The first gives the name of some  
-P-A-G-E-279
  PHUNOLOGY 269 
object ; the second tells them what to do with it; the third 
whispers the consequences of such action. Of course neither 
of the three knows what the others have said. After the 
round is completed each player reports after this fashion: 
“I was told to take a baseball bat and call on Miss Jones. 
The consequences would be that I would never regret it.’’ 
  
CHINESE HOP 
Each ‘‘Chinaman’’ takes his position a yard or so from 
a row of sticks placed within easy hopping distance apart. 
Hach row has ten sticks. At the signal to ‘‘go’’ each con- 
testant begins hopping on one foot down the row of sticks, 
being disqualified for touching any of them with his foot. 
When the last stick has been hopped, the player picks it 
up and hops over the remaining sticks back to the starting 
point. Dropping the stick, he immediately starts back, and 
so on, each time picking up one stick and bringing it back. 
Only the hopping foot must touch the floor or ground in 
this process. The player getting all sticks home first wins. 
A relay may be run in this fashion by having ten con- 
testants to a team and requiring the players to ‘‘touch off”’ 
a teammate before he can begin.

the players stop, drop hands, and imitate the motion chosen,

ing, hitting out with the fists, kicking, ete. The song is 
sung to the tune of ‘‘Lieber Augustine.’’ 
“*Did you ever see a lassie, a lassie, a lassie, 
Did you ever see a lassie do this way and that? 
Do this way, and that way, and this way, and that way;

DUMB CRAMBO 
The players are divided into two sides, one of which 
leaves the room; the other decides upon a word to be 
guessed. Those outside now come in and are told a word 
that rhymes with the one to be guessed. They then retire 
for consultation and on their reappearance proceed to rep- 
resent in pantomime what they suppose the word to be. 
This they continue to do until they guess the right word 
or decide to ‘‘give up.’? When they guess the right word 
the company applauds. 
For example:' They are informed that the word rhymes 
with ‘‘dead.’? After a short time for preparation one of 
their number returns, sits at the piano, and strikes up the 
wedding march. The rest of the group form a bridal party 
and march in slowly. They are informed it is not ‘‘wed.’’ 
Again they retire and after a moment return eating, finally 
finishing and appearing well content. They are informed 
it is not ‘‘fed.’’ Again they come back, marching in step, 
and are told it is not ‘‘tread.’’ Once more they come out, 
cowering before one of their number who stands in 
threatening attitude, but it is not ‘‘dread.’’ Finally they

appear and go through the motions of kneading dough. 
The crowd applauds, for it is ‘‘bread.’’ Another group 
now retires, a new word is selected, and the game con- 
tinues. Two sides may contest. Some suggestive words are 
given: Gin, din, grin, sin, pin, tin; smile, file, pile, rile, 
dial, mile; fight, right, might, night, tight, bite, kite; sick, 
lick, kick, pick, nick, tick; rain, pain, cane, crane, strain. 
  
/qre pacty. DESCRIPTIVE INITIALS ' 
Each person writes his or her initials on a slip of paper. 
These are distributed to the crowd. Each one now must 
write descriptive adjectives beginning with those initials. 
These are read, each person standing as his initials are 
called. H. R. S., for instance, may suggest ‘‘handsome, 
rustic, shy.”’ 
  
DEER-HUNTING 
The fun and excitement of this game comes in the 
watching. The ‘‘hunter’’ and the ‘‘deer’’ are blindfolded 
and are placed at opposite ends of a big table. At a given 
signal they begin to move around the table as noiselessly 
as possible (it will be a good plan to have them wear tennis 
shoes). The object of the hunter is to catch the deer and 
of the deer to avoid being caught, if possible; but neither 
one is allowed to run out into the room. Absolute silence 
should be kept by both the audience and the players. Of 
course if the players make no noise it adds to the fun of 
the game, for it is then difficult for one player to know 
where the other one is, and therefore he will not know 
which way to move. When the ‘‘deer’’ is caught, she may 
become ‘‘hunter,’’? choosing another ‘‘deer’’ from the 
erowd. Or a new couple may be chosen to be ‘‘hunter’’ 
and ‘‘deer.’’

Line up the players in two straight lines, an equal num- 
ber in each line and facing one another. At the head and 
foot of each team’s line is a chair. In the chairs at the 
head of the lines are placed a number of articles of sundry 
nature—tin waiters, teaspoons, balls, bean bags, pans, and 
any other articles at hand. Each chair must have the 
same number and character of articles. At the signal the 
captain picks up one article, passes it on, picks up another, 
passes it on, and so on, until all the articles are taken up. 
Each person must receive the articles, one at a time, and 
pass them on. The player at the foot of the line places 
them in the chair as he receives them, until all the articles 
have come down. He then starts them all back, one at a 
time, until the captain receives them and places them 
in the chair at his end of the line. The idea is to see which 
team can pass the articles down and back first. All players 
stand during the game.—Beryl W. Hundley. 
  
FLYING DUTCHMAN 
Players form in a big ring. A boy and a girl stand out- 
side the ring and start the game by running around the 
circle, holding hands as they run. Directly one of them 
touches a couple in the ring and continues running around 
the circle as speedily as possible. The couple touched must 
immediately run around the circle in the opposite direction, 
also holding hands as they run. If the couple that were 
“Tt”? beat them back to their position, they become ‘‘It’’ in 
turn and proceed around the circle to touch another couple. 
When the running couples meet as they fly around the circle 
in opposite directions it may take some tall maneuvering 
to avoid a collision. This game is full of fun and is espe- 
cially adapted to the out-of-doors.

| GIVEN WORDS 
Each player whispers to his right-hand neighbor a single 
word. It may be whatever he pleases; and the more diffi- 
cult for introduction into a sentence, the better. When 
every one has a word, one player begins by asking a ques- 
tion of his left-hand neighbor, who in reply must introduce 
the word given him, endeavoring to cover it up to avoid 
its detection by his questioner. If the latter discovers the 
word, a forfeit must be paid. The element of contest may 
be introduced by allowing every other person to be a mem- 
ber of one side or the other. Thus a red slip of paper would  
-P-A-G-E-285
  PHUNOLOGY 275 
be given to one, a white slip to the next, and so on all the 
way round. Whenever the word is detected, the player 
surrenders his slip to the leader. At the close the leader 
counts the red and white slips, and the side having sur- 
rendered the least number wins. 
GEOGRAPHICAL CONTEST 
Have players sit in a circle. Some one begins by naming 
a city—for instance, Atlanta. The next person must im- 
mediately name a city or State commencing with the last 
letter. It may be Anderson or Arizona or Albany, for in- 
stance. If it is Anderson, the next place must start with 
the letter N, and so on. As players fail to respond they 
drop out. No name of a town or a State may be used 
twice. The idea is to see who can stay in the game longest. 
If a name is challenged, the player giving it must give its 
location.—Lowise Schlipf, Katy, Tex.

Arrange the chairs so that one faces one way and the 
next one the other. Have just enough for the crowd to

seated the name of something a hunter would carry with 
him on a hunting trip. The hunter, who is standing, now 
goes around the chairs calling out things he wants to carry 
with him on his hunt. When a dozen or so are following 
the huntsman around the chairs, the leader shouts ‘‘Bang!’’ 
and everybody scrambles for a seat, the hunter among 
them. The person left standing becomes hunter, and the 
game continues.—Maggie M. Flowers, Brookhaven, Miss.

you to go also. What will you take?’’ Only those can 
go who answer correctly. To go you must always take 
something that begins with the initial letter of your last 
name. When the player so answers, the leader says: ‘‘You 
can go.’? Thus, if a player’s name begins with ‘‘P,’’ he

farm’’; to the second, ‘‘Making money fast’’; to the third, 
‘‘Marrying merry female.’? Of course the more ridiculous

The players cease marching after singing the line, ‘‘One 
hand in the hopper and the other in the sack,’’ and step 
backward or forward as directed by the miller, who in the 
confusion that may result endeavors to get a partner. If 
he does so the one whose partner he gets becomes miller in 
his stead, and the game proceeds. He may endeavor to 
confuse by changing the steps forward or backward, such 
as ‘‘Girls one forward and men three back,’’ ete. The 
miller must shout in loud voice the steps to be taken.

LAST COUPLE UP 
One player is chosen to be ‘‘It.’? The rest stand in 
couples in a long line behind him. The chaser should not 
be less than ten feet in front of the first couple. The 
eatcher calls: ‘‘Last couple up.’’ The last pair in the 
line must then run toward the front on either side of the 
double line and try to join hands in front of the chaser. 
The chaser may not start until they are in line with him 
and may not turn his head to see where they are coming. 
The couples may vary their method of approach, running 
in close to the lines, or cireling far out on either side, or
-P-A-G-E-292
  282 PHUNOLOGY 
one of them keeping in close and the other detouring. If 
the chaser catches one of them before they can clasp hands, 
this one becomes ‘‘It’’ in turn, and the chaser takes his or 
her partner and stands at the head of the line, which moves 
backward one place to make room for the new couple. If 
the couple are not caught, they are free. 
  
MAZE TAG, OR COLONNADE 
Have a runner and a chaser. Arrange the crowd in 
columns, with ample space between each two players. If 
there are one hundred and two players, ten columns of ten 
players each will be needed. A leader is also needed. 
Columns join hands across, making aisles through which 
the chase proceeds. When the leader blows a whistle and 
calls ‘‘Right face!’’ the columns unclasp hands, turn as 
directed, and again join hands across. Thus the aisles are 
completely changed, and the runner is perhaps saved. 
“‘Left face!’’ brings another change in aisles. The com- 
mands should come repeatedly. It is against the rules to 
break ranks or tag the runner across the clasped hands. 
The chase continues until the runner is tagged or until a 
specified time has elapsed. Two more couples then serve 
as runner and chaser. 
  
NUMBER ANSWER 
Give each person three or four numbers. Place duplicate 
numbers in a hat. Some one designated begins by asking 
the question, ‘‘Who is more foolish than I?’’ The leader 
of the game then draws a number out of the hat and calls 
it out. The person holding that number answers ‘‘I am”’ 
and proceeds to ask another question; for instance, ‘‘ Who 
has bigger feet than 1?” or ‘‘Who is more conceited thar 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
PHUNOLOGY 283 
I?”’ ete. This should continue until all the numbers are 
drawn. 
  
NEST TAG 
One person is the ‘‘fox,’’ or chaser. ‘Another is one of 
the ‘‘rabbits.’’ The rest of the players form in groups 
of four, three of them joining hands and forming a ‘‘nest,’’ 
the fourth being the rabbit and standing in the center. 
The fox chases the rabbit, who may save himself by taking 
refuge in one of the nests. Immediately he enters, how- 
ever, the rabbit occupying that nest must vacate, dodging 
out on the other side, to be chased by the fox. Each time 
a rabbit enters a nest he exchanges places with some player 
helping to form the nest, so that each person gets a chance 
to be a rabbit. Should the fox catch the rabbit, he ex- 
changes places with him, becoming the rabbit and the 
rabbit becoming the fox and chaser. ‘‘Pep’’ is injected 
into this game by frequent dodging into the nests. 
  
ONE-EYED THREADING-THE-NEEDLE CONTEST 
Get girls into one room and boys into another. The 
boys are called in two at a time and are told they are to 
engage in a contest in threading a needle with one eye shut. 
Previous to their entrance two of the girls have gotten 
some soot on the palm of the right hand. The boys are 
requested to sit in two chairs; one young lady provides 
them with needle and thread, and the two designated ones 
hold the smutted palms over the closed eye to make sure 
the contestant doesn’t cheat. You can imagine the effect. 
Each boy will wonder, when the contest is finished, if he 
looks like the other fellow. We heard of one young fellow 
who, after the girl had covered his right eye, complained
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 PHUNOLOGY 
that he could see better out of that eye and preferred that 
the left be covered. Of course he was accommodated.

Serr ed PASS IT 
Divide the crowd into two sides. Have them sit in two 
lines, facing one another. A basket or other receptacle, 
containing quite a number of articles, such as a brush, ball, 
pencil, book, bell, hat, empty bottle, ete., is at the end of 
each line, an empty basket at the other end. At a given 
signal the first person on each side picks up the articles, 
one at a time, and passes them down the line. No person 
may hold more than one article at a time. When passed 
to the last person in line, he drops them into the empty 
basket until all the articles have been so placed. He then 
starts them back down the line one at a time. The side 
first getting all the articles back in the original basket 
wins. If desired, you may test the power of observation 
and memory of the guests by asking each one to write down 
from memory a list of the articles passed, after they have 
been removed from view. v 
  
PARTNER TAG 
All players but two link arms. One of these two becomes 
chaser, the other runner. The runner can save himself by 
linking arms with either member of any couple. The other 
member of the couple becomes runner when this happens. 
The couples, of course, endeavor to elude the runner. 
  
PARTNER QUIZ 
Have couples sit or stand in double line, the partners 
directly opposite one another. An odd plaver is Chief
-P-A-G-E-295
PHUNOLOGY 285 
Quizzer and marches up and down asking questions. The 
person asked must not answer, but allow his or her partner 
to make the reply. If the pérson questioned should answer, 
he exchanges places with the Chief Quizzer. If the partner 
should be caught napping and fail to answer immediately, 
then he becomes the Chief Quizzer. The Quizzer should put 
his questions rapidly and unexpectedly so as to confuse the 
players. 
  
“POOR LITTLE PUSSY CAT” 
Players sit about the room. One player is Poor Pussy 
and must kneel before some person on a pillow and meow. 
This player must pat him on the head and gravely say: 
“Poor little pussy cat.’’? If the player is able to do this, 
after each of three mournful ‘‘meows,’’ without smiling or 
laughing, Poor Pussy must move on to try his luck with 
some one else. When he makes some one smile or laugh, 
that person exchanges places with him and becomes Poor 
Pussy in turn. 
  
PICTORIAL GEOGRAPHY 
This game can be used in a school party, but it may be 
used at any time. Have a series of cards on which are 
pasted pictures cut out of newspapers or magazines and 
representing some geographical location. Thus Arkansas 
could be represented by the letter R, a can, and a saw; 
Tennessee, by the number 10, the letter S, the letter C. 
Others that could be easily represented are: Little Rock, 
Towa, Ohio, Sacramento, Wheeling, Red Sea, Waterbury, 
Montana, Washington, Potomac, etc.

puzzle, with a prize for the couple first to succeed. Or 
eut in four irregular pieces. Give these out promiscuously, 
one to each person. Have the company scramble about to 
find the rest of their quartet. This would make a good 
mixing game for the beginning of an evening’s fun. 
  
POST OFFICE 
One player is blindfolded and stands in the center of the 
room as postman. Another is postmaster and has a list of 
cities, the names of which have been given to the players, 
one to each of them. The postmaster calls out the names” 
of two cities, saying, ‘‘I have a letter from Nashville to 
Louisville,’’ for instance. Immediately the players having 
the names of those two cities must rise and change seats, 
the blind postman trying to catch one of them or sit in 
one of the seats vacated. The player who is caught or 
whose chair is taken becomes postman. Players may crawl, 
run, walk, dodge, or dive to get by the postman, but are 
not allowed to step outside the circle of chairs. If the 
postman has much difficulty in catching some one, the post- 
master may call out the names of four cities at one time, 
thus making it almost certain he will catch some one. Keep 
the game moving rapidly. The announcement that the 
“‘General Delivery’’ window is open causes a mad scramble, 
all the players having to change chairs. This game may be 
varied by giving the players names of different kinds of 
fruit or flowers. Then ‘‘Fruit basket upset’’ or ‘‘Garden 
grab’’ causes the general mix-up, when all must change 
chairs, the ‘‘peddler,’’ or ‘‘gardener,’’ endeavoring to 
catch some one or get a seat in the seramble.

PROVERBS 
Seat the players in a circle and send one out of the room 
to stay until he is called back. While he is out of the 
room the opening stanza of some familiar song is chosen, 
or a famous quotation is selected, and each person is given 
a word in that quotation, and when the person has been 
ealled back into the room he has to ask each player some 
question, which he must answer, giving that word in his 
sentence. For instance, ‘‘Drink to me only with thine 
eyes,’’ and the person had the word ‘‘me,’’ and you would 
ask him his name. He could say, ‘‘Me name is,’’ ete., but 
anything goes to hide the word he is supposed to use. 
After every one has been asked a question, and the person 
has received an answer, he is to put these words together 
as best he can and give what he thinks is the proper quota- 
tion. Sometimes the right one can be discovered almost 
from the first, and then again not at all. The harder the 
selections, the better—Ruth Hudson. 
  
PLAYING FOOL FOR THE CROWD 
Pick out from one to twelve persons, according to the 
size of the crowd. Have them go out of the room. These 
are to act as musicians. Select four or five judges. The 
judges are instructed to name every instrument but the 
ones the musicians are trying to imitate. Call in two or 
three of the musicians at a time and instruct them to play 
upon some imaginary musical instrument. Place them be- 
fore the judges, who will be supposed to try to guess the 
name of the instrument each one plays. The judges, of 
course, guess the wrong instruments and appear puzzled. 
Now ask the crowd what they are playing, and they will 
respond in chorus, ‘‘Fools for the crowd.’’—WMiss M. E.

POISON CIRCLE 
Here is a jolly game to music. With chalk draw a num- 
ber of circles on the line of a large ring around which the 
players are to march. The music starts, and the players 
begin to move briskly, no lagging being allowed. When 
the music stops all players must stop immediately. One 
aexp after the music stops disqualifies a player, and he must 
drop out. All players standing in or on the smaller circles 
are ‘‘poisoned’’ and must drop out. The player to survive 
wins. In case all players should happen to be in ‘‘poison 
territory’’ at the same time, the round is annulled and they 
march again. 
  
ey Musical) POISON PENNY 
Here is a game somewhat similar that will cause a lot of 
excitement. A penny is given to one player in the circle. 
When the music starts playing, the penny is passed rapidly 
from one player to the other. Whoever has possession of 
the penny when the music stops is ‘‘poisoned’’ and must 
drop out. No player is allowed to hesitate in receiving the 
penny when it is passed to him. When only two players 
are left they pass the penny back and forth to one another 
until the music stops, and one of them is thus ‘‘poisoned.”’ 
Any article may be substituted for the penny. For a large 
group several articles should be kept moving. 
| PARLOR DODGE BALL 
Divide your crowd into two groups. One group forms 
as big a circle as is possible, and the other group takes the 
inside of the circle, standing about promiscuously. The 
circle group is provided with a very light rubber ball, such  
-P-A-G-E-299
  PHUNOLOGY 289 
as you can buy at the ten-cent store. The ball is of the type 
that is so light it is difficult to throw it with any degree of 
accuracy, and should it hit anything or anybody no damage 
would be done. 
At the signal from the leader to start, the circle group 
begins to throw the ball at the group within the circle. 
No player is allowed to throw from any place except his 
position in the circle. Any player hit must immediately 
leave the circle. Should he not do so, the throwing side 
may recover the ball and throw at him until he does leave 
the circle. For each hit after the first under these cir- 
cumstances they are awarded one point. At the end of 
five minutes or such time as is set, the players surviving 
inside the circle are counted and one point is allowed for 
each one. The sides then change places, and the throwers 
take the inside of the circle for five minutes. 
No limit is set on the number of throws a side may make. 
It is allowable to make as many legitimate throws as can be 
erowded into the five minutes. 
RHYMING CONTEST 
Divide the crowd into two sides. They may remain 
seated. Have some one begin now with a simple line that 
will be easy to rhyme. Any one in the room may add any- 
thing, just so it makes a full line and rhymes. A con- 
testant to get the attention of the leader must shout, 
“‘Ready!’’ The leader designates which has precedence in 
case more than one should shout. This person gives his 
line and is given a slip of paper on which to write it. The 
side with the largest number of slips at the close wins. No 
person who has already given a line may give another 
until everybody else has had an opportunity. After this 
contest, which may last a stated time, gather up all the

slips, toss them in a hat, and have them read as they are 
drawn from the hat. 
  
RING 
The crowd forms a circle and passes along from one to 
the other a ring on a string that goes completely around 
the circle. The person in the center tries to catch some one 
with the ring and may grasp the hand of any, player he 
suspects and call for a ‘‘show-down.’’ The players may 
pass the ring either direction and should endeavor in every 
way to fool the player in the center. Any person caught 
with the ring must exchange places with the player in the 
center. Players should move their hands constantly along 
the string so that when the ring is passed from hand to 
hand the person who is ‘‘It’’ will not see where it is. 
  
| THE ROMANCE OF A SHIRT-WAIST GIRL 
Here is a writing game that proved entertaining to a 
class of young ladies. It is entitled ‘‘The Romance of a 
Shirt-Waist Girl.’’ The story was typewritten and placed 
in a neat cover, on the outside of which was pasted the pic- 
ture of a shirt-waist girl cut out of some fashion magazine. 
Each one present was given a copy of the romance and 
told to fill in the blank spaces in the story with something 
belonging to a shirt-waist. Here’s the romance: 
Her lover had persuaded her to be his, and they were

SHADOW PORTRAITS 
One of the company is appointed artist. Hach person 
in turn is seated near the wall, with the shadow of his face 
falling in profile upon a sheet of white paper, which is held 
or pinned on the wall. The only light in the room must 
be that from a single powerful lamp, that the shadow may 
be clear and distinct. The artist traces with a pencil the 
outline of the face and head upon the white surface, and 
hands the result to an assistant, who carefully cuts it out, 
writing the name of the person represented on the back. 
These silhouettes are numbered and placed on a dark back- 
ground (curtain or screen), one at a time. The crowd is 
provided with paper and pencil and guesses the names of 
the originals.

SHIP AFLOAT 
Players are seated about on the floor or grass in a circle. - 
One player, as captain of the ship, moves about inside the 
circle, holding a pillow. This he throws at some player, 
saying: ‘‘Ship afloat! What are you going to take?”’ 
The player indicated by the pillow answers immediately, 
perhaps, ‘‘Sauerkraut.’’ ‘‘All right, you can go,’’ says 
the eaptain, and the player is privileged to leave the circle 
and take a chair or a position somewhere outside the circle. 
The next player indicated by the pillow probably says, 
«“Hlavdstack.” “Sorry, but you can’t go,’’ says the cap- 
tain, and the person must remain seated in the circle. The 
secret is this: The article named must begin with the 
initial letter of the player’s last name. Thus the player 
answering ‘‘Sauerkraut’’ was named Smith. Of course he 
could go. The player answering ‘‘Hard-tack’’ was named 
Jones, and therefore he must stay in the circle. Some 
players will catch on almost immediately; others will be 
completely mystified and will try everything but the right 
one. There’s where the fun comes in. 
- his game may be played without the captain, one player 
who knows the game starting it by tossing the pillow to 
another in the circle, saying: ‘‘Ship afloat!’’ The player 
to whom it is thrown then says: ‘‘What will you take?”’ 
On receiving the answer, this person tosses to some one 
else, and so on. 
SHOEMAKER 
The company, with the exception of one person, is seated 
on the floor in a circle as close together as possible. This 
one person stands in the center with a slipper in his hand 
and, giving the slipper to any individual in the circle, 
says  
-P-A-G-E-303
  
PHUNOLOGY 298 
**Shoemaker, shoemaker, mend my shoe; 
Get it done by half past two.’’ 
He then turns his back to the side of the circle on which 
the ‘‘shoemaker’’ sits and covers his eyes with his hands 
for a moment. All the players have their hands back of 
them. The one to whom the slipper was handed at once 
puts it back of her and passes it on, so that when the owner 
of the slipper turns and demands the return of his property 
it cannot be found. The owner then starts to hunt for the 
slipper, the object of each player in the circle being to 
keep the one in the center from seeing it, from getting hold 
of it, or from knowing where it is as it travels here and 
there back of the players in the circle. If the one who 
is ‘‘It’’ becomes too mystified, the slipper may be tossed 
across the ring now and then just to give him a clue. The 
player who is ‘‘caught with the goods on him’’ changes 
places with the one in the center, and the slipper is again 
taken to the ‘‘shoemaker.’’ 
SLANG 
Have the players write all the slang words and phrases 
of which they can think in five or ten minutes. Then 
surprise the crowd by giving first prize to the one who has 
the least and the booby prize to the one who has the most. 
  
SLIDE, KELLY, SLIDE 
Here is a very noisy game. Be sure you have good stout 
chairs before attempting to play it. Have the crowd sit 
in a circle in chairs. One chair is empty. One person 
stands in the center to be ‘‘It.’? He gives the signal to 
move, either to the left or right direction. All players must 
slide in the direction indicated into the next chair. The
-P-A-G-E-304
   294 , PHUNOLOGY 
player who is ‘‘It’’ has the right to reverse the order of 
direction at any moment, his object being to get a seat. 
If he succeeds, the person next to him on his left, if the 
order was ‘‘Right,’’ is ‘‘It.’’ If the crowd is going to the 
left, the person caught is the one to his right—Beryl W. 
Hundley. 
(Another way to play this game is not to require the 
person who is ‘‘It’’ to call out anything. He merely dashes 
for the empty seat while those sitting endeavor to prevent 
his getting a seat by sliding around to fill it.)

MTHREE DEEP 
This is an old and well-known game. Players stand in 
two concentric circles, so that one player will be directly 
behind another all the way round. Two players not in the 
circles are chaser and runner, respectively. The runner 
may save himself from being tagged by stopping in front 
of any couple. The outside player of this couple im- 
mediately becomes runner, since the circle at his point has 
become three deep, and may, in turn, save himself by stand- 
ing in front of any other couple. The new couple drops 
back into proper position in the circle. Should a player be 
tagged, he immediately exchanges places with the chaser, 
and the chaser becomes runner.

THROWING THE HANDKERCHIEF 
The company is seated around the room in a circle. 
Some one in the center throws an unfolded handkerchief

WITH WHOM YOU WERE, WHERE YOU WERE, 
AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING 
In playing this game you select three persons, who go 
around to those sitting in the circle, one whispering to 
each person with whom they were, a second telling them 
where they were, and the third telling them what they were 
doing. As one does not know what the other is telling, 
some rare combinations will result. The players must tell 
in turn what they have been told in this manner: ‘‘I 
was with a policeman on the roof, playing ring around the 
rosy.’’ In one group we understand a very staid old maid 
got this combination: ‘‘I was with the Y. M. C."A. Secre- 
tary, sitting on the radiator, smoking cigarettes.’’-—Ruth

chair and run to the ‘‘winker’s’’ chair. Her partner must 
endeavor to hold her in the chair, but cannot step from 
behind his chair to do it. The young man losing his partner

“THREE MAIDS OF LEE” 
There were three young maids of Lee, 
As fair as fair could be, 
And although not yet twenty, 
Lovers had a plenty, 
These three fair maids of Lee. 
301
-P-A-G-E-312
  302 PHUNOLOGY

To these three young maids of Lee, 
As fickle as could be, 
Some were too thin and tall, 
Some too fat and small; 
And one his nose was not just right, 
Another’s mouth was such a sight; 
Some others eyes were brown, not blue, 
And how could they know they’d be true. 
‘*We’ll wait,’’ said these young maids of Lee, 
As fair as fair could be. 
3 
(Turn about). 
There were three old maids of Lee, 
As old as old could be; 
And now quite far past twenty, 
Of lovers had not any, 
These three old maids of Lee, 
As sad as sad could be. 
They had waited all in vain, 
And all their charms had slain; 
So take you warning, girls, 
From these old maids of Lee, 
As sad as sad could be. 
This requires four participants. One of them reads the 
above bit of rhyme. The Three Maids of Lee stand facing 
the audience loeking as coquettish and attractive as pos- 
sible. On the reading of the third verse they turn face 
about. On the back of each head has been placed a false 
face with the hair in the back brought down tight over it, 
and dressed up just as old maidish as possible. An apron 
is worn so as to make it appear that the person is standing 
face foremost. There should be some covering to hide the 
feet. A board or piece of cloth drawn across the plat- 
form just high enough to hide the feet will answer the
-P-A-G-E-313
  PHUNOLOGY 303 
purpose. During the reading of the third verse the Maids 
of Lee shake their heads dismally. 
  
THE HUMAN FORD 
This is one of the most laughable stunts imaginable. 
The participants appear on the platform and take their 
positions. Four of them represent the car occupants, in- 
eluding the driver. They arrange four chairs and seat 
themselves, two in front and two in back. A young man 
then assumes leapfrog position in front of the chairs. He 
is evidently the engine and radiator. On the top of his 
head he has tied a baking powder can. Four others group 
themselves about the chairs as the wheels. They stoop and 
hold to their ankles. An extra tire is on the back. The 
Ford is now ready to go. 
The driver gets out, and, taking hold of the extended 
hand of the ‘‘engine’’ he cranks the machine. The 
“‘engine’’ begins to purr engine-fashion and then sputters 
out just as the chauffeur starts to get back into the Ford. 
He cranks it again and then they start. The riders can 
inch their chairs along and the rest of the Ford moves 
with them. 
There is a hissing sound and the back tire nearest the 
audience flattens out. The chauffeur gets out, makes the 
people in the back seat get up, pretends to get his pump, 
applies it to the tire and goes through the motions of 
pumping air into it. The tire rises slowly as if being in- 
flated. 
The next mishap is the radiator running out of water. 
The driver takes off the cap and pretends to pour in water. 
They get started again and there is a blow-out. Some- 
one in the car on the side away from the audience has a 
tightly blown paper sack. He pops this and the front tire 
next to the audience flattens out. The driver gets out,
-P-A-G-E-314
  304 PHUNOLOGY 
mops the perspiration from his brow, and after getting 
his imaginery tools, takes the wheel off. It is well to re- 
member here that there are four lugs on a Ford. He 
rolls the tire to the rear and gets his extra tire. This he 
puts on, putting the old one in the place at the rear. 
Next a traffic cop riding an imaginary motor cycle and 
making all the accompanying noise catches up with the 
Ford and stops it. He pretends to take the number and 
the necessary information and then rides off. <A tip from 
the driver may be needed to appease him. 
The final mishap is engine trouble. The driver gets out, 
lifts the hood (the ‘‘radiator’s’’ coat) on one side, then 
on the other. He soon has the trouble fixed, and the Ford 
moves on its way. 
The chauffeur must remember each time to crank the 
machine. The stunt is all the funnier when not a word is 
said.   
  
THE KINGDOM OF NONSENSE 
A trumpeter or herald appears, marching straight across 
to stage center, and then turning at right angle and march- 
ing to front of stage. He carries a little toy horn, and 
with great flourish plays three feeble blasts. Then in 
stentorian tones he announces: 
“Hoye! Hoye! The hour of nonsense has now arrived, 
and King Hezabug, ruler of the Kingdom of Nonsense, is 
at hand. Be gone, dull care! Vanish from our midst, ye 
devils of gloom! Enter joy, gladness, and hearty laughter! 
THE KING IS HERE!” 
There is a beating of tin-pans, ete., and the King and 
his Court make their appearance. First come the royal 
door-keepers, each carrying a mop. Door-keeper Number 
One walks across the stage and takes his position there. 
The other stands at the door he has just entered. Both
-P-A-G-E-315
  PHUNOLOGY 305 
stand at attention. The King enters next followed by two 
attendants, each of whom carries a broom. As the King 
ascends the throne, all bow before him. The attendants 
take their positions on either side of his Royal Highness 
and start fanning him with the brooms. 
The King now announces the opening of his court and 
asks if there are any petitions. Doorkeeper Number One 
responds reading from a scroll a petition which propounds 
the question ‘‘How to be happy, though married.’’ The 
King calls for one of his wise men, Sidewise by name, to 
answer the question. The other Door-keeper brings him in. 
The wise man enters walking side-wise. He makes appro- 
priate answer to the petition at the King’s request. 
The next petition is called by Doorman Number Two and 
bears a request for information on the vital question: 
‘“How to make a Maltese Cross.’’ After an elaborate and 
eloquent speech this wise man, who is Crosswise, and who 
enters with hands and feet crossed, closes by saying: 
“‘Therefore, O King, if thou wouldst make a maltese cross, 
just pull his tail!’’ 
Petition number three concerns methods of improving 
the town, city, community, or place. Lengthwise is called 
and comes in on all fours, and at full length. He arises 
to standing position and faces the King, answering the 
petition with many marvelous suggestions. 
Petition number four has to do with the important ques- 
tion, ‘‘How to train a husband.’’ Otherwise is called, and 
enters on roller-skates or hobby-horse. He or she waxes 
eloquent with suggestions. 
At the close of this speech the King leaves his throne 
and paces up and down the platform, tremendously stirred 
by the possibilities in the suggestions made. He walks 
faster and faster, his two attendants behind him. Finally 
he falls in a swoon. 
The Witch Doctor is called, and after his incantations he
-P-A-G-E-316
  306 PHUNOLOGY 
advises that the King needs entertainment. He calls for 
the Troubadours. They enter and to ukelele accompani- 
ment sing ‘‘Sweet Ivory Soap.”’ 
This rouses the King but seems not to please him for he 
drives them all from him except the two attendants. He 
then calls for some real entertainment. 
This serves as an introduction for the stunts of the eve- 
ning, over which the King presides. The two attendants, 
in turn, call the stunts in the order in which they come. 
They also act as stage hands when necessary. 
Needless to say all costumes are as ridiculous as it is 
possible to conceive. The attendants might wear bathing 
suits, with skirts made of willow branches hung from their 
waists. Bright colored stockings and tennis shoes will help. 
A large sun-flower might also serve as a head-piece, with 
sun-flower breast-plates giving the final touch. 
The Herald should wear a long feather in her hat, and 
in other ways burlesque the usual herald’s garb. So with 
all the others. Curtains, scarfs, and other bright-colored 
pieces may be made to do service, achieving remarkable 
effects. 
The wise men may act as judges to determine the best 
stunt of the evening. 
  
THE USUAL YOUNG PEOPLE’S MEETING 
The leader comes in late, hurriedly passes out Scripture 
references and clippings, fumbles through the songbook 
for a song to sing, and shows every evidence of lack of 
preparation. The singing drags, and everything is done in 
slipshod fashion.
-P-A-G-E-317
  PHUNOLOGY 307 
A MOCK TRIAL 
Try some well-known member for being a slacker in the 
organization’s work. Have all witnesses for both the 
prosecution and defense well primed so that the trial may 
not lack ‘‘pep.’’ The attorneys should be young men or 
young women of ready tongue. 
THE KLASH AND KLATTER BAND 
The members of this band are supplied with tin pans, 
combs, tin bucket, etc. One player presides at the piano, 
and the leader directs with a rolling-pin. The pianist 
plays some popular air, and the band keeps as good time 
as possible at the direction of the band leader, who stands 
with back to the audience and does all sorts of Creatore 
stunts. On the back of the leader hangs a placard bearing 
the name of the organization. Some wonderful music is the 
result of their efforts. If you don’t believe it, try it. 
  
HIGH-CLASS VAUDEVILLE 
This is all purely burlesque and will afford lots of fun. 
First there must be a ‘‘Jazz Orchestra,’’ with a leader 
who makes wonderful gyrations as he directs it. The 
players use combs and paper or, better, the little ‘‘Zobo”’ 
instruments that may be purchased at a ten-cent store. 
The program begins with a number by the orchestra, such 
as ‘‘Beautiful Ohio,’’ for instance. The piano is used, of 
course. During the performance, excepting when Madame 
Human-Schank sings, the orchestra always plays appro- 
priate music. The players in this orchestra should get to- 
gether for at least one rehearsal of all the music they expect 
to use.
-P-A-G-E-318
  308 PHUNOLOGY 
The features in the program follow: 
Samsonia, the Strong Girl, or Slamsome II (if a boy is 
used).—This person should wear a sweater or jersey and, 
by the use of rags stuffed in the arms and shoulders, ex- 
hibit tremendous muscular development. The first stunt 
is to lift a large dumb-bell with one hand and finally by 
great effort hold it high above the head. This dumb-bell 
happens to be a broomstick with a large ball of rags 
covered with black at either end. A five-hundred-pound 
weight is then lifted, and following this comes the grand 
climax (slow music by the orchestra) as a thousand-pound 
weight is lifted after several attempts. The performer 
lets go of this weight and proceeds to bow to the audience 
in appreciation of the applause. But, marvelous to behold, 
the weight remains suspended in mid-air for a moment, 
and then moves upward, seemingly of its own volition. 
The weights have been made out of black cardboard or out 
of pasteboard painted black and are made to look as real- 
istic as possible. The heaviest weight has been tied to a 
long piece of black thread, which is drawn over a chandelier 
or anything else convenient. Some one in the rear has hold 
of the end of this thread and at the proper time draws it 
up, pulling the weight with it. 
Juggo.—Four or five songbooks have been tacked to a 
stick so that one seems to stand on the other endways. 
Holding the book side to the audience, Juggo does a seem- 
ingly clever juggling stunt and concludes by swinging the 
entire arrangement down, showing the crowd the other side. 
A cigar box is tacked at one corner to a long stick. Juggo 
pretends to do a difficult juggling stunt in keeping the box 
balanced. A pencil is then balanced on the nose by use of 
a piece of chewing gum. 
Tashimura Tiroga.—A girl dressed in Japanese costume 
is needed for this. She performs on an imaginary tight 
rope, balancing herself, walking, running, dropping care-
-P-A-G-E-319
  PHUNOLOGY 309 
fully to one knee, jumping and turning about while in the 
air. Use is made of the usual Japanese parasol. A chalk 
line may be drawn on the floor to represent the tight rope. 
This performer should practice her stunt so as to do it as 
cleverly as possible. 
Madame Human-Schank.—A young man dressed up in 
female costume sings ‘‘ Perfect Day,’’ ‘‘I Hear You Calling 
Me,’’ or some other song in falsetto. 
Anna Eva Fay is a mind reader who may answer ques- 
tions supposed to have been asked by persons present. 
Herman the Great may pull off some fake sleight-of- 
hand tricks. 
Mechanico.—At one conference we attended one of the 
girls was remarkably clever at impersonating a mechanical 
doll. She wasn’t very heavy, so one of the larger girls 
carried her in and dropped her on a chair. She kept the 
position in which she happened to land until the keeper 
straightened her out. The keeper then stood her up and 
arranged her in various positions, some of them being 
take-offs on persons present. She said ‘‘Mamma’’ and 
‘‘Dada’’ when the keeper touched the button, and never 
batted an eye when a lighted match was held very close 
to her forehead. 
The performance closes with another number by the 
orchestra. Placards are printed and used to announce the 
different numbers on the program. 
  
A SUCCESSFUL OPERATION 
A nurse, an office boy, a doctor, and a patient represent 
the cast. The nurse is lamenting the fact that she has no 
opportunity to use her new-found knowledge (she has just 
been graduated). A knock on the door, the office boy opens 
it, and a man stumbles inside and faints on the floor. The
-P-A-G-E-320
310 PHUNOLOGY 
nurse becomes terribly excited, rushes to see what the book 
says, then applies the knowledge thus learned to the patient, 
ealling frantically to the office boy to hurry after the doctor. 
The book has advised that ‘‘in case of fainting the patient’s 
“head should be raised,’’ so the nurse has raised the head 
and put a book under it to hold it up. The doctor comes 
in with a large suit case, which he opens, allowing saw, 
butcher knife, etc., to fall out on the floor. After examina- 
tion of the patient, feeling of pulse, ete., he decides an 
operation is necessary. With the help of the nurse and the 
officexboy, he lifts the patient up on a table, a sheet is 
thrown over him, and the doctor proceeds to sharpen the 
butcher knife. Laying this aside, he picks up the saw, 
pretends to examine it, and then begins to saw away, the 
patient groaning all the while. Directly the doctor tosses 
to the floor a shoe into which has been stuffed a club 
covered with a sock. He has amputated the patient’s leg, 
but still the patient groans; so after puzzling a moment he 
grabs the butcher knife and pretends to operate at the 
back of the neck. The nurse pulls out a long white string, 
with the remark that, now that the patient’s spinal cord 
has been removed, he certainly ought to feel better. Still 
the patient groans. The doctor now tries again, operating 
on the patient’s side. Directly the nurse holds up a tin 
ean, saying: Oh, it’s a can, sir [cancer]!’’ The patient 
gets up and walks off briskly, remarking: ‘‘Now I feel 
fine.’’ 
  
SINGING A SONG BACKWARD—NO. 1 
Announce that your group will do the most difficult 
stunt of singing ‘‘Yankee Doodle’’ backward. After the 
pianist strikes the chord, the entire group turns with baeks 
to the audience and sings. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  PHUNOLOGY 311 
HUMAN ORGAN 
Eight persons stand in line facing the audience. It 
will help the effect if four are dressed in black and four 
in white, the black and white alternating. One person 
stands back of this line and plays the organ, touching first 
one and then the other on the head. The person touched 
stoops and then assumes original erect position, at the 
same time uttering the necessary sound. The organist may 
play ‘‘Yankee Doodle’’ or ‘‘Ain’t Got No Style’’ or any- 
thing familiar to the crowd, the ‘‘keys’’ struck giving the 
desired tones. In the same manner the chimes may be 
played. A variation of this stunt is to have the hands of 
the persons representing the organ stuck through holes 
in a sheet, the organist playing on these hands. 
  
TAKE-OFFS 
It always furnishes lots of fun to pull off ‘‘take-offs’’ on 
some of the prominent folks at your assembly. A borrowed 
coat and hat and a little make-up, with some cleverly 
imitated mannerisms, will very often strike off some notable 
to perfection. 
  
MINSTREL 
A minstrel is always entertaining, especially when the 
jokes are connected up with the names of persons present 
and well known. It is also one of the easiest stunts to 
arrange. 
UNDER THE SPREADING CHESTNUT TREE 
One person represents the tree, holding thickly leaved 
boughs in front of him. Two others come in and seat them-  
-P-A-G-E-322
  312 PHUNOLOGY 
selves beneath the boughs on either side. They then pro- 
ceed to crack ‘‘chestnuts,’’ telling old jokes, perhaps giving 
them a personal flavor. For instance, one will say to the 
other: ‘‘Say, do you know the difference between the man 
who has seen Niagara Falls and the man who hasn’t?’’ 
“Why, no. What is it?’’? ‘‘Well, one of them has seen 
the mist, and the other has missed the scene.’’ The ‘‘tree’’ 
shakes as if in convulsive laughter at each joke. After 
each one of the jokes the listener may make some remark 
about its being ancient. Perhaps he says: ‘‘That one 
was told here back in 1885. You know that was the first 
year Miss [naming some prominent worker in the 
assembly] attended the assembly.’’   
  
UPSIDE-DOWN SING 
A sheet is stretched across the platform. The singers 
gather behind it, just showing their heads above the top 
of the sheet, and render some selection. They then drop 
down, and in a moment the singers appear to be standing 
on their heads singing. Just above the sheet all along 
appears a row of inverted shoes all wiggling about. The 
singers have simply dropped down behind the screen, put 
a pair of shoes on the hands, and lifted them up, singing 
all the while. The effect is very ludicrous. An inverted 
quartet may be worked in the same fashion. 
  
GIANT SUFFRAGETTE 
With the curtain drawn across the platform, a giant 
suffragette is created. One of the girls stands on a chair, 
and one or two sheets are made to cover the chair and the 
body of the girl, giving the effect of a gigantic woman. 
She is introduced as ‘‘Madame Tankburst’’ and proceeds
-P-A-G-E-323
  
PHUNOLOGY 318 
to make an earnest speech, simply repeating over and over 
the alphabet, placing the emphasis now on one letter and 
now on another, with violent gestures to emphasize the 
earnestness of her appeal. 
  
ATTENDING THE MOVIES 
A group sit on the platform and appear to be intent on 
looking at a ‘‘movie.’’ A late arrival causes the usual 
eraning of necks to see and some frowning and fussing, be- 
cause he blocks the view and perhaps steps on some one’s 
foot. The ‘‘movie’’ ‘fans smile, laugh, applaud, look in- 
tent, expectant, chagrined, disturbed, revengeful, and 
finally burst into applause and smile as the hero and 
heroine evidently come out victorious. 
  
THE DWARF 
Two persons play the dwarf, a third acting as ‘‘spieler. 
The spieler may explain that the dwarf was captured in 
the wilds of Patagonia and enlarge on his accomplishments. 
The dwarf may sing in quavering voice, dance, say a little 
speech, crack a joke with the spieler, ete. To arrange the 
dwarf place a table in a doorway between two rooms or 
place it on the platform and use an improvised screen to 
hide the preparations for the exhibit. Cover the table 
with a cloth or curtain that reaches to the floor. One 
person stands behind the table and places his hands on it. 
Over his arms draw a pair of boy’s trousers and put a pair 
of shoes on his hands. Thijs gives you the legs and feet 
of the dwarf. The second person stands behind the first 
and passes his arms around his shoulders. A large coat 
is put over his arms and buttoned down the front of the 
first person. A cape is thrown around his neck, hiding > 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 PHUNOLOGY 
the head of the person behind. The dwarf may be dressed 
as a Turk, if desired. The hands of the second person 
tip the dwarf’s hat or salute for him, as he bows to his 
audience, and make gestures when he talks or sings. The 
dwarf finishes his dance by suddenly lifting both feet from 
the table and appearing suspended in the air, finally drop- 
ping them and appearing exhausted from the effort. He 
closes the performance by lifting his feet to his mouth and 
throwing kisses to the crowd. 
  
THE CONTORTIONIST 
We saw a crowd completely fooled by this stunt. Stuff 
the legs of a pair of trousers. Attach a pair of shoes. This 
may be done by putting broomsticks down the legs, con- 
necting them at the top, and nailing a pair of old shoes to 
them. Stuff plenty of filling in about the broomsticks. 
The table must be arranged something like the table for the 
dwarf, and a screen used to allow the performer oppor- 
tunity to get ready. He draws the stuffed trousers across 
the back at the waist. Standing immediately behind the 
table, he seems to lift one of his legs up on the table. 
Then after a supreme effort he lifts up the other one. Of 
course these are the stuffed legs. He now pulls one of 
the legs up past his ear, then lifts the other one, and after 
letting them both down walks off the platform holding 
the stuffed legs out from his waist. 
  
BRIDE AND GROOM 
One boy is both of them. He folds a lady’s hat and 
wears it on one side, and folds a gentleman’s soft hat and 
wears it on the other side. He doubles a lady’s waist, puts 
one arm through both sleeves, and a skirt is doubled and
-P-A-G-E-325
  PHUNOLOGY 315 
pinned up to the waist. He then may carry on a dialogue, 
turning one side to the audience when the bride is speak- 
ing, and the other side when the groom is talking. They’ 
may make love, quarrel, sing to one another, ete. 
  
VICTROLA STUNT—NO. 1 
Announce that a troupe of artists has been stranded and 
will perform for the benefit of the crowd. Set up a vie- 
trola behind curtain or screen. Quartets, duets, solos, 
instrumental and vocal, may be rendered, the performers 
going through the motion as the victrola records furnish 
the music, some one behind the screen tending the machine. 
  
VICTROLA STUNT—NO. 2 
A large square packing box, a clothes wringer, a mega- 
phone, a tin can, and possibly a long slip of paper are 
needed for this stunt. The platform should be curtained 
off to allow time for preparation. The open side of the box 
is set away from audience, the megaphone is stuck in a hole 
near the top, and the wringer is placed on top. The crank 
is turned and the record announced, accompanied by the 
seraping noise peculiar to cheap phonographs. This noise 
is made by scraping the tin can with some rough substance. 
The announcement is made in a nasal voice. The record, 
your long slip of paper, is run through the wringer as 
the number is rendered. The performers could sit on a 
primary chair in the box or stick their heads into the box 
and sing or speak through the megaphone. Quartets, duets, 
solos, recitations—the funnier the better—could be ren- 
dered. It would add to the fun to have one of your 
records get the needle in a groove and sing one syllable 
over and over until the manipulator fixes it. It would be
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 PHUNOLOGY 
well if the top and sides of the ‘‘victrola’’ could be cur- 
tained off so the ‘‘records’’ could be changed without the 
persons being seen. 
JOHN BROWN’S BABY 
‘As a feature of a ‘‘singsong’’ have every one sing ‘‘ John 
Brown’s Baby Had a Cold on Its Chest,’’ after the follow- 
ing fashion : 
‘¢John Brown’s baby had a cold on its chest, 
John Brown’s baby had a cold on its chest, 
John Brown’s baby had a cold on its chest, 
And they rubbed it well with camphorated oil. 
Chorus 
Glory, glory, hallelujah! 
Glory, glory, hallelujah! 
Glory, glory, hallelujah! 
And they rubbed it well with camphorated oil.’’ 
On the second round the word ‘‘baby’’ is dropped, and 
a ‘‘rock-a-by-baby’’ motion with the hands is substituted 
for it. On the third round both ‘‘baby’’ and ‘‘cold’’ are 
dropped, the ‘‘rock-a-by’’ motion being again substituted 
for ‘‘baby’’ and a coughing sound being substituted for 
“‘eold.’’? On the fourth round ‘‘chest’’ is added to the list 
of dropped words, and a thumping of the chest with the 
palm of the right hand is substituted. Next ‘‘rubbed’’ is 
dropped and a rotary, rubbing motion with the right hand 
substituted. On the final round drop the ‘‘camphor’’ in 
‘“‘ecamphorated,’’. and draw a deep breath through the 
nostrils, ending the line with ‘‘ated oil.’? The last two 
substitutions will also have to be made in the chorus. This 
is a mighty good stunt to break up stiffness in a crowd. It 
may also be used as a stunt by a group.

JOHN BROWN’S BODY 
Each round a word is dropped from the first, second, and 
third lines. 
‘*John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the grave, 
John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the- grave, 
John Brown’s body lies a-moldering in the grave, 
Glory, glory, hallelujah!’’ ete. 
The first time ‘‘grave’’ is dropped, then ‘‘the,’’ then 
in,’”’ and so on, so that on the last round the singers 
merely open their mouths as if to sing on the first three 
lines, coming in strong on the last line, ‘‘As we go march- 
ing on,’’ and then on the chorus. Singers should keep 
good time, making allowance in time for the words dropped. 
To this end one of the number may act as director. “ce 
  
SINGING A SONG BACKWARD—NO. 2 
Several girls wearing aprons backward, and boys wear- 
ing their coats backward, walk in backward, and, with backs 
to the audience, bow. They hold sheets of music or song- 
books behind them and turn the pages as they sing, singing 
some such song as ‘‘Three Blind Mice,’’ for instance. At 
the close of the song they bow again and walk off with 
backs to the audience. 
  
A WOMANLESS WEDDING 
[All the participants are men dressed and made up for 
the part. The bride should be a hefty specimen and the 
groom correspondingly small. At the close of the ceremony 
the bride may lift the groom and kiss him a resounding 
smack on the cheek. There should be the usual bridesmaids,

flower girls, best man, father and mother of the bride, 
aunts, ete. The following ceremony was used by Broad- 
way Church, Louisville, Ky. When objection was made 
by the rejected suitor, the bride, a two-hundred and twenty 
pounder, fainted, and it took half the crowd to hold her 
up. One of the boys was dressed as a baby in long dress 
and carried in by one of the men, representing one of the 
family. The ‘‘baby’’ cried at intervals during the pro- 
ceedings :] ‘ 
Dearly beloved, we have gathered together this after- 
noon in the sight of each other and the presence of these 
numerous witnesses to join together this man and this 
woman, which is an honorable mistake. These two have 
come hither for the most worthy purpose of forming this 
combination or union in order to reduce the high cost of 
living, believing that one can live more cheaply than two. 
Wherefore they have chosen the wise part and have de- 
cided to become one. It is evident to my mind that they 
have given this momentous and weighty question due con- 
sideration, for I am informed that their courtship has been 
of long duration, extending over a joyful period of sixty 
days, more or less, proving that ‘‘love at first sight’’ played 
no part in the culmination of this nuptial event. The little 
germ called ‘‘love’’ sometimes lies dormant in the human 
chest for many years, until one day a spontaneous com- 
bustion takes place and the little spark has become an all- 
consuming conflagration, which cannot be extinguished by 
. any known fire extinguisher. This unknown quality called 
“‘love’’ is more ancient than the Pyramids of Kansas or 
the Honeycombs of Georgia or the Obelisks of Kentucky. 
Ever since that eventful night when the man in the moon 
became full and with beaming face went forth to conquer, 
and while crossing the Milky Way met Miss Venus, the 
goddess of beauty and love, who winked and blinked at 
him in such a way that he fell behind the horizon, then 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
PHUNOLOGY : 319 
and since then other men who do not live in the moon 
have become full of admiration and love for the fair sex 
and have fallen into the matrimonial net. At the altar 
they have stood side by side, while he sighed and sighed, 
and they were both beside themselves with rapturous joy. 
Furthermore, we are told that life is just one foolish 
thing after another, an example of which we have before 
us. Here we have two hearts with but a single beat, and 
that a sugar beet; two heads with but a single neck, and 
that a rubber neck; two fools who wish to act as one. 
Into this awful mistake these two persons come now to 
be joined. Therefore if any can show just cause why they 
may not be lawfully joined together, let him now speak or 
else hereafter forever hold his peace. I pause. 
[Objection by rejected suitor, who says, ‘‘I have.’’ 
“State your objections, if you are of sound mind.’’ Re- 
jected suitor makes complaint that he spent three dollars 
on the bride at one time or another. Father agrees to settle 
the bill and let the wedding proceed.] : 
I require and charge you both—$10,000, please—as ye

take this fragile Rosebud to be your side partner until your 
timepiece ceases to tick or until a friendly divorce court 
breaks asunder the cables that are soon to bind you in 
voluntary slavery? I assume that you fully realize that 
you are about to surrender the great and glorious feeling 
of being a free man and you voluntarily give up the liberty 
guaranteed to you by the Declaration of Independence and 
the Constitution of this great country, the United States of 
America—bossed only by your Uncle Sam—and that you 
have been seized with an insane desire to support another 
man’s daughter for the remainder of your natural life. 
If so, I require you to make the following pie crust promise:
-P-A-G-E-330
  320 PHUNOLOGY 
Will you purchase for this spouse a machine of the latest 
model, with which she may while away her idle time? 
Hither a ‘‘Singer’’ or ‘‘Wheeler and Whistle’’ will do. 
Will you promise to buy her a spring bonnet at some 
rummage sale at least once in three years and consent to 
buy her a pair of leather shoes within five years after 
peace has been declared? Will you promise not to object 
to her wearing canvas shoes when she gets ready to make 
her canvass for the high and exalted office of Justice of 
the Peace and Plenty; that you will not boil over when 
she announces in the morning that the monthly meeting of 
the ‘‘Woman’s Debating and Anti-Gossip Club’’ is to have 
an all-day meeting and suggests that you get your dinner 
and supper at the ‘‘Heavy Cup and Pewter Spoon Cafe- 
teria’’; that you will not raise a howl when she allows you 
only a three-grain sugar capsule for your coffee or tea; 
that you will not ask for an itemized account to show what 
became of the $1.30 you gave her the week before on which 
to run the house; and that you will take your turn when it 
comes to washing the dishes, including kettles and frying 
pans? And, furthermore, that when the latest Paris styles 
in low-cut necks and short-cut skirts reach Louisville you 
will not visit Fourth Avenue without wearing heavy green 
goggles and that you will not turn to rubber; that you 
will love and care for this young and tender Rosebud, and 
only her, even though the Daisies be plentiful?

Headlight to be thy bright and shining star and follow him

of the Portland Canal or the turbulent and treacherous 
falls just beyond, and that you will not disobey him in 
any unreasonable request he may make, even if he should 
say, ‘‘Plunge in, dearest’’? Wilt thou promise not to go 
through the pockets of his trousers at midnight while he 
gently sleeps, in search of idle coin or souvenirs of bygone

refrain from sewing buttons on his shirts and polish his 
shoes with stove paste? Wilt thou give him hot rolls at 
least twice a year and pies like mother used to make on 
Thanksgiving Day? ‘Wilt thou promise to make the fires, 
cut the wood, milk the cow, drive the geese to water, never 
have company, and never refuse an invitation to tea?

thumb and repeat: ‘‘With this ring I thee wed, and with 
all my unpaid bills I thee endow, and shall always strive to 
keep your hard-earned wages in constant circulation.’’

FREAK EXHIBIT OR SIDE SHOW 
A good ‘‘spieler’’ should be selected, one who has both a 
ready tongue and a keen sense of humor. He proceeds to 
inform the audience that he has a collection of curiosities 
unequaled in extent and variety in the entire world. He
-P-A-G-E-332
  322 PHUNOLOGY 
offers for their approval the greatest show on earth. He 
then leads from behind the curtain the ‘‘World’s Most 
Beautiful Woman,’’ a young man in female garments with 
plenty of ‘‘make-up.’’ Use plenty of gilt paper in decorat- 
ing ‘‘her’’ dress. Jewelry and medals should further add 
to ‘‘her’’ flashy appearance. The ‘‘spieler’’ tells ‘‘her’’ 
story, relating deeds of valor and bloodshed performed for 
love of ‘‘her.’’ 
Next the ‘‘Chinese Giant’’ will be introduced. This may 
be worked out after the fashion of the ‘‘Giantess,’’ men- 
tioned elsewhere in this book, or the effect may be secured 
by the person standing on a stool wearing an exceedingly 
long robe (of cheesecloth, perhaps). The toes of a pair of 
yellow slippers showing beneath the gown will help. A 
drooping mustache and ‘‘pig tail’’ will be necessary and 
ean be easily made. He may corroborate the story of the 
‘*spieler’’ as he tells it. For instance, the showman might 
make the assertion that the giant doesn’t understand a word 
of English and then turn to him saying: ‘‘Isn’t that so, 
Chang?’’ ‘‘Velly much so,’’ comes back the reply. 
The ‘‘Modern Hercules’? could be represented by a 
young man in sweater and tight-fitting trousers. Plenty of 
cotton stuffing would furnish the enormous muscles neces- 
sary. A ‘‘biga-da-chest’’ shoulders and arm development 
ean be easily faked in this way. He could bite iron bars 
(sticks of licorice) in two, lift ‘‘fake’’ weights, and strut 
about is if he might annihilate the whole crowd. 
The ‘‘Two-Headed Girl’ is the next exhibit. Two girls 
encircle each other’s waist with one arm. The other is 
put into a sleeve of a loose-fitting gown, which is fastened 
around both waists by a sash. A cape can be fastened 
about both necks, fastening in the back. The length of the 
gown conceals the feet. The eyes of both may wink at the 
same time or may roll in the same direction simultaneously. 
Both open mouth to speak in concert. A system of signals
-P-A-G-E-333
‘ 
PHUNOLOGY 323 
will be needed for this, so that each will know when it is 
time for ‘‘eyes right’’ or ‘‘eyes left,’’ ete. 
The ‘‘Fat Lady’’ could be produced with the use of 
quite a number of pillows. The ‘‘spieler’’ should tell her 
weight, something of her family history, and inform the 
audience that she is only sixteen and still has a chance to 
grow. 
The ‘‘Wild Man’’ could be brought in with the ‘‘Fat 
Lady.’’ He should present a very meek and subdued ap- 
pearance, the ‘‘spieler’’ explaining that he is the ‘‘Fat 
Lady’s’’ husband and is only wild when out of hen 
presence. 
The ‘‘Bearded Woman,’’ the ‘‘ Albino,’’ and the ‘‘Zgyp- 
tian Mummy?’’ are possibilities that might be worked up 
cleverly. The latter could be bound up in cheesecloth, 
colored by dipping in coffee, and burlap, and must be 
garried in and deposited upon a table. 
A “‘Mind Reader’’ could also be introduced, pulling off 
‘chits’’ on persons in the company by answering imaginary 
questions that are supposed to have been asked by these 
persons. The Mind Reader, of course, is blindfolded and 
goes through maneuvers as though she were reading the 
questions and answers from out in space. 
  
THE CROAKERS 
Four or five participants hop in on all fours, frog 
fashion. They may seat themselves on the floor or on very, 
low-seated chairs or boxes. Immediately they are seated 
they repeat in concert this bit of foolishness: ‘‘What a 
funny fing a frog are! When he hops he yumps, and when 
he yumps he sits on his tail, which he ain’t got almost 
hardly any.’’ The Chief Croaker now calls the meeting 
to order with the announcement that ‘‘all the brother and
-P-A-G-E-334
  324 PHUNOLOGY 
sister croakers will now come to order.’’ He then calls 
for ‘‘anything for the good of the order’’ and the Croakers 
one after another enter complaints of sundry. nature about 
different persons present, about things that have happened 
at the assembly, ete. They will adjourn by repeating ‘‘The 
Croaker’s Watchword,’’ again giving ‘‘What a funny fing 
a frog are!’’ ete. 
  
MISS POPULARITY 
A young lady sits reading. A bell rings, and the maid, 
earrying a large tray, goes to the door. After taking the 
eard she ushers the gentleman in. Miss Popularity greets 
him cordially, thanks him for the artificial flowers he 
brings, and they sit down, carrying on an animated con- 
versation in pantomime. Again the bell rings, and this 
time the maid returns with another card. The young lady 
looks at it, appears a little ‘‘fussed,’’ grabs the young man, 
to whom she has been talking, pulls him out of his seat, 
and brings him to his knees. She then puts the tray on 
top of his head and throws a table cover over him, thus 
making a table out of him. The second young man comes 
in, bringing a box of candy, which the young lady puts 
on the improvised table. After a few seconds of pan- 
tomime conversation the bell again rings. When the card 
is presented Miss Popularity seizes the second caller, stands 
him up, and converts him into a hatrack by throwing an 
overcoat over his head and thrusting his arms into the 
sleeves part way. She hastily jams a hat on one of the 
outstretched arms. The third caller comes in, hangs his 
hat on the other outstretched arm, and sits down to con- 
verse a moment, when the bell rings again. This time the 
ealler is transformed into an armchair by dropping him 
in a chair and covering him with a blanket. During the 
performance the ‘‘table’’ may reach up and help himself
-P-A-G-E-335
  PHUNOLOGY 825 
to the candy occasionally. The ‘‘hatrack’’ may change his 
position. The fourth caller starts to seat himself in the 
improvised armchair, the young lady excitedly grabbing 
him and thrusting him toward another seat. The ‘‘hat- 
rack’’ in rebellious mood now shoves caller No. 4 into the 
“*table’’ and both fall against the ‘‘chair.’’ All come out 
from cover and run off the platform, after looking dis- 
gustedly at one another. Each caller should reach the 
point of proposal before the bell interrupts. This can be 
varied by having No. 4 represent a soldier or an Epworth 
Leaguer, whom the girl accepts, walking off with him arm 
in arm, to the discomfort and chagrin of the others, who 
throw off their coverings and look dejected or angry. 
  
ANIMATED MUSIC SHEET 
Stretch a sheet across the platform, reaching to the floor. 
Place a number of chairs back of the sheet. On these the 
performers are to sit, kneel, or stand, according to the 
position desired. Holes are cut in the sheet at different 
heights, the sheet having had the five lines of the scale 
drawn across it with charcoal or black crayon. Around 
the holes in front draw vegetables, fruits, and flowers with 
colored crayon. The singers arrange themselves on the 
chairs in back of the sheet, putting their faces through the 
holes. The ‘‘animated’’ sheet then renders some songs, 
preferably of rousing character. They may sing some 
jingles aimed at persons prominent in the assembly. For 
instance, ‘‘Rig-a-jig-jig’’ may be sung, using words some- 
thing after the fashion of the following: 
1. While I was walking round this place, 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o, hi-o! 
I saw an awfully desperate case, 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o!

Rig-a-jig-jig, and away we go,

2. Of course I’m not tehing all I know, 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o, hi-o! 
But it is awful, my O, my O, 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o! 
3. Our president on a bench he sat, 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o, hi-o! 
With a pretty girl, just think of that! 
Hi-o, hi-o, hi-o! 
A quartet or chorus could present some effective numbers 
in this manner. 
SUNFLOWER MINSTREL 
Draw a sheet across the platform after the fashion of 
the preceding stunt, though the music staff will not be 
necessary, and the holes will be cut to suit the height of 
the participants. Around the holes sunflower petals are 
drawn with crayon. When the curtain is drawn the par- 
ticipants, with minstrel make-up, faces blackened, and lips 
reddened, all have eyes closed. While the piano plays the 
prelude to the opening song, they suddenly open their 
eyes, roll the eyeballs from side to side, open their mouths 
wide and shut them with a snap. The chorus of ‘‘My 
Sunshine Jane’’ (Brennan-Ball) would make a good open- 
ing chorus. Songs and jokes can then be interspersed just 
as in a regular mistrel show.

MIDGET LADIES 
(Prize stunt. Sixteen young ladies needed for this per- 
formance.) 
Stretch a large piece of white cloth across the platform. 
Cut eight holes in it for the heads of eight of the partici- 
pants. These young ladies thrust their heads through the 
holes thus provided, each wearing a paper bow of bright 
color. Beneath the head, sewed to the sheet or cloth, which 
reaches to the floor, is a small dress of similar color to the 
bow. To the sides of the dress are holes for the arms and 
hands of the girl, and below the dress, two other holes for 
the feet. The feet.are represented by another girl who 
thrusts through these holes hands covered with stockings 
and shoes. Tables are placed so as to provide a platform 
for the performance of these miniature ladies, who will 
look ridiculously funny. They may sing, crack jokes, and 
dance. Gestures with the hands should be made in unison, 
all folding them at the same time, holding them to the 
heart, holding them palm out, ete. The possibilities are 
unlimited for working out some clever entertainment.— 
Ruth Hudson, Petersburg, Va. 
  
CALLIOPE 
Six boys represent the pipes. A seventh acts as operator. 
He carries a long baton and taps each boy on the head to 
let him know that his turn has come. As each one emits 
the note in calliope style he stoops. One of the ‘‘notes’’ 
may get stuck occasionally, making the shrill sound peculiar 
to calliopes, until the leader fixes it. Much depends on the 
clever manner in which this stunt is presented.

FARMER BROWN’S FAMILY 
Now I’m here to talk about the man who would walk about 
A mile every day—into town; 
His name was Ebenezer Brown, well known for many miles around. 
He used to mingle with the boys who were single, 
Take them out to the farm, to the farm. 
He always had a good excuse, his daughters he would introduce, 
With a smile he would take them by the arm and whisper: 
Chorus 
**Now, here’s my tallest daughter, 
Take a look at her, take a look at her. 
And here’s my smallest daughter, 
Take a look at her, take a look at her. 
She’s my baby, little Cinderella, sweet sixteen and never had a fellah. 
They all take after father, just five of them to bother me. 
And here’s my wildest daughter, 
Take a look at her, take a look at her. 
And here’s my mildest daughter, 
Take a look at her, take a look at her. 
Here’s my neatest, she’s by far the sweetest. 
Every one is old enough to marry. 
Come on, boys, and help your,zlves to the pick of my family! ’’ 
Brown used to talk about a lane that was out about 
A mile from the town—in the wood, 
The single fellows understood, ’twas close to Brownie’s neighborhood. 
There any lover could make love under cover 
Of the bright silvery moon, shiny moon. 
They always had a good excuse, Brown’s daughters would be 
introduced, 
With a smile he would take them by the arm and whisper. 
[This was put on as a faculty stunt at Asilomar As- 
sembly. One person made up as Farmer Brown. He sang 
the words of the song, introducing his ‘‘daughters’’ as he 
came to them in the chorus. The music is not available, 
so a tune may be improvised, or the words may be recited.

The ‘‘daughters’’ were the men of the faculty made up as 
girls. The ‘‘tallest’’ daughter was the shortest, the ‘‘small- 
est’’ was the largest, the ‘‘wildest’’? was the mildest, and 
so on. The make-ups were ‘‘screams.’’ The words should 
be sung or recited distinctly, and each ‘‘daughter’’ steps 
to the front as Farmer Brown introduces ‘‘her.’? Some 
of the popular music of the day will furnish suitable 
accompaniment if played softly while the words are 
spoken. ] 
  
A LIVE SOCIAL WITH FOUR GOOD STUNTS 
‘About the only ‘‘dope’’ I know of just now is to tell you 
briefly of a social I attended in Boston not long ago. There 
were only four ‘‘stunts,’’ but they were worked out and 
enthusiastically entered into, making a lively evening. 
1. A March Around.—All present marched around the 
large room in a column formed of couples (a boy and a 
girl.) One boy stood in the center of the room with a 
stick. When this stick was thrown to the floor, each man 
had to rush to another girl (any one he chose) and secure 
her as his partner. The one left out each time had to go to 
the center of the room and throw the stick for the next 
time. This game was not only fun, but served to ‘‘break 
‘ the ice’’ and get folks acquainted 
2. League-of-Nations Telegram.—All present sat in a 
large circle around the room, the couples from the previous 
game sitting beside each other—i. e., those who happened 
to be together at the close. Each couple was to send a tele- 
gram to President Wilson with reference to the League of 
Nations, using words beginning with the combined letters 
of their two last names, and no others. Hither name could 
come first, but the words had to follow the natural order 
of the letters. (For example: ‘‘I had a Miss Rich with 
me.’’ Our telegram was: ‘‘Rush into coal hod. R you a 
 
-P-A-G-E-340
  330 PHUNOLOGY 
nut?’’) I should have stated that these telegrams are, 
read aloud by one of each couple, after about five or ten 
minutes has been allowed for their preparation. Some 
were very ridiculous and funny, others surprisingly sensible 
and cogent. 
3. Lemon Race.—All present are divided into two equal 
sides and lined up, facing each other. A lemon is started 
down each line, each person receiving it in his two hands 
and placing it in the two hands of the person next to him. 
When the lemon gets to the end of the line, the person 
receiving it runs as fast as possible to the end of his line 
from which the lemon started and hands it to the one on the 
end. This person passes it on down as before, and the 
runner takes his place at the front end of the line. This 
is continued until one side has had all of its members run 
with the lemon. The side that finishes first naturally wins 
the contest. For unrestrained fun and enthusiasm this 
contest cannot be excelled. (I should have stated that the 
runners go between the lines that face each other, not out- 
side.) 
4. Spinning the Bottle—Again all present sit in a large 
circle around the room, but not necessarily by couples. 
Some one spins a large bottle in the center of the room, 
asking it some silly question—e. g., ‘‘Which girl present 
has received the largest number of proposals? Who will 
marry first? Who has the biggest feet?’’ ete. The person 
to whom the neck of the bottle points when it stops spin- 
ning is the one to whom the particular question applies. 
Then he (or she) has to get up and ask the question and 
spin the bottle, and so on ad infinitum. If the questions 
are witty, much laughter and fun will result. 
After these stunts refreshments were served and the boys 
chatted together in little groups, gave a few school yells, 
and a number (including ‘‘yours truly’’) gathered around 
the piano and sang popular songs.

It was one of the best socials I have attended. It goes 
to show that it is not necessary to have a large number of 
events on the program. Four or five live stunts, well 
planned and enthusiastically executed, will make for a 
royal good time.—Rev. Phil H. Ryan, Louisville, Ky.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
MISCELLANEOUS STUNTS 
ALEXANDER 
Have the persons in the crowd write questions on slips 
of paper. Explain that ‘‘Alexander the Great’’ will an- 
swer these questions, reading them in a mysterious manner. 
An assistant merely rubs them across ‘‘ Alexander’s’’ fore- 
head with the paper folded, picking them indiscriminately 
from a hat. When the question is read by Alexander in 
this mysterious manner, the person writing it is asked to 
hold up his hand and verify the correctness of the reading. 
Alexander then unfolds the slip, looks at it to verify his 
own reading, answers the question, and then proceeds with 
the next question, mystifying the crowd with his uncanny 
exactness in reading the folded slips as they are rubbed 
on his forehead. He is enabled to do this because of a 
secret confederate in the crowd, who lays claim to the first 
question, no matter what it is. Really he has put no slip 
in the hat, merely pretending to do so. ‘‘Alexander’’ 
reads the slip to verify the reading for himself and thus 
gets the question on the slip to give to the crowd as an- 
other slip is rubbed across his forehead. And so on through 
the slips he goes. 
  
ACTING PROVERBS 
Divide the crowd into groups. Let each group act out 
a proverb of its own selection, the rest endeavoring to 
332 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
PHUNOLOGY 333 
guess what it is. You might have judges to decide which 
group makes the most clever presentation. Suggested 
proverbs: ‘‘All is not gold that glitters,’ ‘‘A fool and 
his money are soon parted,’’ ‘‘There’s many a slip ’twixt 
the cup and the lip,’’ ‘‘ All’s well that ends well,’’ ‘‘Two 
heads are better than one,’’ ‘‘Birds of a feather flock to- 
gether,’’ ‘‘Every dog has his day.’’ This latter one could 
be represented by persons standing on all fours in a row, 
each with a dog name and the name of a day of the week 
on a card hung about the neck. Thus there would stand 
“‘Carlo, Monday’’; Fido, Tuesday,’’ ete. 
  
ABROPLANE RIDE 
Place a small block about three inches high under an 
ironing board or any other stout board. Blindfold the 
rider. Place two strong young men at either end of the 
board. Two more young men stand about the middle on 
either side to help the rider keep his balance. He rests his 
hands on the shoulders of these two. The men on either 
end now lift the board a few inches, wiggling it back and 
forth. The middlemen at the same time stoop gradually 
until they are near the floor. The rider is now told to 
jump and will probably hesitate about doing so for a while. 
The sensation through which he has passed has led him to 
believe he has gone up pretty high. This is an especially © 
good stunt for the out-of-doors. We know one crowd that 
produced a startling sensation for the rider by waving a 
branch of a tree in his face. 
BOOTS WITHOUT SHOES 
The players una¢quainted with this stunt are brought in 
one at a time. The leader instructs them thus: ‘‘Do as
-P-A-G-E-344
334 PHUNOLOGY 
I do and say what I tell you to say.’? Then with some 
violent or ludicrous jesture he says: ‘‘Say ‘Boots with- 
out shoes.’’’ The answer will most likely come back, 
“Boots without shoes,’’? accompanied by the gesture. 
‘*Wrong,’’ says the leader. ‘‘Now watch me.’’? He goes 
through some ridiculous movement and says: ‘‘Say, ‘Boots 
without shoes.’ ’’ The point is that the way to say ‘‘Boots 
without shoes’’ is to say ‘‘Boots.’’ A clever leader can 
keep a crowd in an uproar at the funny antics through 
which he carries the victims. 
  
BABY PICTURES 
Have each guest bring a baby picture of himself or one 
taken in early childhood. Number these and have the 
company guess ‘‘who’s who,’’ writing the names down on a 
slip of paper. 
  
BLIND FEEDING THE BLIND 
Blindfold boy and girl and provide each of them with a 
saucer of pop corn or broken-up crackers and a spoon. 
Have them sit facing one another and each feed the other. 
It would add to the fun to mix a little molasses with the 
corn or crackers. 
  
BABY MARATHON 
The contestants sit on the platform in couples. Each - 
couple is furnished with a baby’s milk bottle. Any other 
bottle with a nipple fitted on it will answer. At the 
signal to start each girl holds the milk bottle while the boy 
drinks. It would be advisable to enlarge the holes in the 
nipples somewhat. It will add to the fun to have at least 
four couples contesting for first, second, and third places.

BLIND BANANA FEED 
Blindfold several couples. Give a peeled banana to each 
person. Have the couples clasp left hands, and at the 
signal to start they begin trying to feed one another. As 
some wild stabs may be made, it is well to provide paper 
aprons or bibs for the participants by cutting a hole in a 
sheet of newspaper and dropping it over the head. 
BEAN BARGAIN 
Here is a stunt or game that will keep a large crowd 
amused for a half hour or more. As many as seven hun- 
dred have played it at one time. Mark on slips of paper 
numbers from 1 to 100, 200, 300, or as high as you want 
to go. Pass these out to your crowd, one slip to each one, 
Make a note for yourself of what you choose to designate 
as the lucky number. At the same time you give the num- 
bers give each one ten beans. When every one has been 
supplied, explain to the crowd that the game has two aims 
—one, to see who will have the most beans at the end of the 
time agreed upon; the other, to see who will hold the secret 
lucky number at the close of time. The players are in- 
structed that they may now bargain for the numbers held 
by other players. For instance, one player discovers that 
another has 13. He thinks that this is likely to be the 
lucky number, so he offers three beans for it. He raises 
the bid to five beans, and if he thinks it most certainly 
must be the lucky number he may offer all ten of his beans 
for it. The other player may sell or not, as he sees fit. 
Some players may wind up by holding as many as four 
numbers. Some other players by clever bargaining may 
obtain numbers for one or two beans and sell them for four, 
five, or six, and so on. At the close perhaps 41 is an-

nounced as the lucky number, and the person holding 
that number is one of the winners. 
  
CONCERT 
Each one in the company adopts an instrument on which 
he performs. Each person selects the tune he may think 
best suits his instrument and endeavors to imitate the 
action and, as closely as possible, the sound peculiar to his 
instrument. Lots of ‘‘pep’’ should be injected into the 
performance. Violin, cornet, clarionet, trombone, piano, 
ukulele, banjo, drum, tambourine, cymbals and hand organ 
are some of the available instruments for this concert extra- 
ordinary. 
  
CURIOSITY TENT 
Placard your exhibition ‘‘For Men Only.’’? Of course 
you won’t be able to keep the ladies out. On entering the 
exhibit one finds on display all sorts of men’s apparel and 
things used by men exclusively—men’s shoes, neckties, pair 
of trousers, razor, derby, pipe, etc. 
  
COSTUME RACE 
Several girls or boys contest in this race. Hach is pro- 
vided with a suit case in which is packed a ridiculous cos- 
tume—odd shoes of large size, brilliant colored kimonos, 
funny-looking hats, ete. At the signal to go each one 
starts across the course to a point designated, opens the 
suit case, togs up, closes the suit case, and rushes back to 
the starting point. Here the toggery must be removed, 
placed back in the suit-case, and then the suit-case most be

CATS’ CO¥ = kT 
Here’s a diversion for a fe ~* tes that is calculated 
to liven things up. Each ne he crowd selects some 
tune for himself. At a sig... .rom the leader all sing at 
the top of their voices the different tunes selected. 
  
ENDLESS THREAD 
Have a piece of white cotton thread sticking on the back 
of your coat. Naturally some one will attempt to remove 
it. Then the fun begins, for as the obliging person pulls 
the thread away from the coat it becomes longer and longer, 
while the joker walks away, finally turning around and 
appearing astonished and chagrined at what has happened. 
The trick is worked by putting a spool of thread in the in- 
side pocket of the coat, after just enough of it has been 
threaded through a needle and passed through the back 
of the coat so that a bit of thread appears to be only 
sticking to the clothes. This would be a good stunt to 
work at an April Fool party. 
  
Ss enre a ELECTRICITY 
Half the crowd should be acquainted with the stunt. 
One of the number goes from the room. The rest decide 
on some simple object. The player is recalled and told 
that an object has been selected, and if he will join the 
circle they will all join hands, and by sitting very still 
and thinking only of that object the thought will finally 
impress itself on his brain. All join hands and sit very 
quietly, when soon the guesser announces the object, to 
the astonishment of the uninitiated. The guesser, of course, 
sits next to one of the ‘‘wise’’ ones, who, unnoticed by the

rest, gently presses his hand once for A, twice for B, and 
so on until the word is spelled out. A short pause is made 
between letters, and a responsive pressure from the guesser 
bids the speller continue. Some one may help things along 
by starting a discussion of mental telepathy, thought 
waves, ete. 
  
THE GIANTESS 
‘A tall man may be dressed in a skirt. A large umbrella 
is covered with a gown and a cloak. A ball of cloth is 
fitted on the stick above the dress, and a bonnet and thick 
veil are put on it, completing the head. The umbrella is 
partially opened, the man gets under it, and, holding the 
handle as high as he can, appears like a gigantic woman. 
‘‘Her’’ appearance might be heralded by a knock on the 
door and the announcement that ‘‘Miss Petite’’ has arrived. 
“‘She’’ walks in and bows. ‘‘She’’ may give the appear- 
ance of startling growth by holding the umbrella naturally 
when entering and then gradually raising it. She may 
talk in a squeaky falsetto voice. 
GENTLEMEN NURSEMAIDS 
Have several girls do the dummy-dressing. Seat the men, 
blindfold each one, and request him to double up his right 
fist. Mark eyes, nose, and mouth of a face on the fist with 
burnt cork. Tie around this a doll cap or lace frill or 
ruffle of some sort and fasten around the wrist a full white 
apron or skirt. Now bend the left arm to lie across the 
waist, place the right arm across, with wrist resting in 
bend of the left elbow, draw the apron down over the right 
arm, and each gentleman will appear to be holding a baby. 
Remove the blindfolds now.

Teeb reaker GIGANTIC SNEEZE 
Divide the company into three groups. One group is to 
shout ‘‘Ish,’’ the second ‘‘Ash,’’ and the third ‘‘Shoo’’ 
at a given signal. This conglomerate sound resembles a 
gigantic sneeze. 
  
GROUP LOGOMACHY 
Here is a good get-acquainted stunt. Pin on each person 
a card bearing the initial of his last name. Tell all that 
the letters are to spell themselves into words. Mr. B finds 
Miss A, for instance, and together they may find Miss T. 
They write ‘‘bat’’ or ‘‘tab’’ down on their cards. Then 
they proceed to find another T or maybe a U, depending on 
whether they want to spell ‘‘battering’”’ or ‘‘tabulating.’’ 
When groups have spelled out their words they may break 
up and form new groups, always writing on their cards 
the words spelled. Prizes may be awarded to the person 
getting the largest number of words spelled and also to the 
person having the largest total of letters. 
  
HOBBLE HURDLE 
(Prize Stunt) 
Contestants (boys or girls) are robed in tight-fitting 
‘hobble skirts’’ of cheesecloth or sackcloth and at a given 
signal race across the room. The least spurt or sudden 
burst of speed is liable to upset not only the dignity but 
the equilibrium of the contestant. Halfway down the 
course are pasteboard barriers over which the ‘‘hobblers’’ 
must hurdle the best they can.—Beryl W. Hundley, Rich-

No one will object to being a ‘‘hog’’ for a few minutes 
in order that the crowd might be amused. Several con- 
testants are required to get down on all fours. A news- 
paper is put in front of each of them, and on it is placed 
an apple. At the signal to begin each starts eating his 
apple, the use of the hands not being allowed. The idea is 
to see which one can first consume his apple hog fashion. 
  
HURLY-BURLY 
Players are all seated about informally. The leader 
whispers in the ear of each one some action to be per- 
formed. One may ‘‘sing a song,’’ ‘‘dance a jig,’’ ‘‘play 
a drum,’’ ‘‘make a speech,’’ recite ‘‘Mary had a little 
Jamb’’ with dramatic gestures, ete. When all have been 
given something to do, the leader shouts ‘‘Hurly-Burly!’’ 
when all must perform the acts assigned them simul- 
taneously. Any one failing to perform immediately on 
the shouting of ‘‘Hurly-Burly’’ is punished by being made 
to walk the ‘‘swamp,’’ beginning at one end of the room 
and answering questions put to him by the crowd, stepping 
forward one step when the answer is ‘‘Yes’’ and backward 
one step when it is ‘‘No.’’ 
HARLEQUIN WRESTLE 
Each person stands on one leg. They grasp right hands. 
Each tries to make the other lower his upraised foot to the 
floor or touch the floor with the free hand. Touching 
opponent with the free hand is not allowed. Sides may 
contest in this stunt, the winning side being the one with 
the largest number of victories.

SE POINT” 
One person leaves the room. His assistant has explained 
that this person can always tell to whom he is pointing, 
though he is out of the room and cannot possibly see what 
is being done. He calls ‘‘I point,’’ each time pointing to 
some one in the room, the guesser calling back, ‘‘Point on.’’ 
Then finally the pointer calls, ‘‘To whom do I point?’’ and 
the person outside invariably answers with the correct 
name. The secret is that when the pointer says, ‘‘To whom 
do I point?’’ he always points to the last person to speak 
before his confederate left the room. This may be varied 
so that it is the first person when he comes back or the 
person to the right or left of the person to speak. A 
definite understanding must be had as to the system to be 
used. The pointer should lead the crowd astray by various 
means, using the same number of calls for a while, pointing 
from one particular side, asking his partner as he leaves 
the room, ‘‘Are you sure you have the connection ?”’ ete. 
IS IT THIS? IS IT THAT? 
One person leaves the room. His confederate tells the 
company that if any one of them will touch an article in 
the room or name it, the person outside will come back and 
tell which article was touched or named. When he comes 
back the confederate points to different objects and ques- 
tions him thus: ‘‘Is it this?’”’ ‘‘No.’’ ‘‘Is it this?’’ ‘‘No.”’ 
“Ts it this? ’ ‘‘No.’’ ‘Is it that?’’ ‘‘Yes.’? The guesser 
gets his tip from the substitution of ‘‘that’’ for ‘‘this’’ in 
putting the question, so that when he is asked, ‘‘Is it 
that?’’ he knows at once that this is the article.

instrument through which you hum, obtainable at ten-cent 
stores). Combs covered with paper will do when the zobos 
are not obtainable. Play several selections, the director 
announcing the numbers each time. For instance, he an- 
nounces ‘‘Schubert’s Serenade,’’ and the Kazoo Band 
plays with a good deal of flourish, gusto, and ‘‘pep’’ some 
“‘ragey’’ piece of music, such as ‘‘How You Gonna Keep 
*Em Down on the Farm?’’ 
LETTERFLY 
Introduce your cpmpany one at a time to the Fly family. 
There are Mr. Housefly, Miss Butterfly, Mr. Horsefly, Miss 
Dragonfiy, ete. The last to be introduced is Miss Letter- 
fly, who has a wet cloth which she throws in the face of the 
person being introduced. The victim should not see the 
cloth until it hits him. All the ‘‘flies’’ stand with hands 
behind them, reaching out the right hand when introduced.

on the piano. ‘‘Turkey in the Straw’’ makes a good laugh-

MENTAL TELEPATHY 
Two persons work together on this, explaining to the com- 
pany that success depends on concentration. One of the
-P-A-G-E-353
  PHUNOLOGY 343 
two leaves the room. The rest decide on some trade or 
profession and think of that one thing so steadily that the 
thought will be transmitted to the absent one, who is now 
asked to come back. ‘‘Is it a conductor?’’ ‘‘No.’’ ‘‘Is it” 
a lawyer?’’ ‘‘No.’’ ‘‘Is it a machinist?’’ ‘‘Yes.’’ The 
understanding between the two is that just before the 
trade is mentioned some profession is named. There are 
many varieties of this stunt. Thus to guess any object 
named it might be decided between the two confederates 
that the thing named shall come after something black, or 
something with horns, or a small fruit, as a cherry or 
plum, may be used as the tip, or something with four 
legs, ete. 
  
MAGICIAN 
Put on the table three pieces of bread or other eatable 
a little distance from one another. Cover each with a hat. 
Lift the first hat and eat the bread. Lift the second and 
do likewise. Lift the third and also eat that piece. Now 
ask any person in the crowd to choose the hat under 
which he would like the three pieces of bread to appear. 
When he has made his selection, make a few mysterious 
passes over it, say ‘‘Hokus Pokus Bunkus,”’ place it on 
your head, and ask him if he is satisfied that they aro 
under it. 
  
THE MYSTERIOUS BALL 
A wooden ball with a hole half an inch in diameter is 
needed, though a large spool might do. Pass this, with a 
small piece of cord, around for examination. The per- 
former now runs the cord through the hole in the ball, and 
the ball runs up the cord, stopping where he tells it to 
stop. Again the ball and the cord are handed around for in-  
-P-A-G-E-354
  344, PHUNOLOGY 
spection. After the cord is returned the magician lays it 
on the table, and when the ball is returned he picks up the 
cord and with it a piece of black thread, running both 
through the hole in the ball. The other end of the thread 
passes out behind the scenes or off the platform to an 
assistant. Take the lower end of the cord in one hand 
and the other end and the thread in the upper hand. The 
assistant now pulls the thread taut, and as the magician 
commands he raises, lowers, or stops the ball where desired. 
THE MYSTERIOUS CHINESE WRITING 
Two persons must have complete understanding of this 
mysterious chirography. One goes out of the room; the 
other remains and asks the company to select some word 
to be written. For illustration we will use an easy one. 
Say ‘‘cat’’ is the word chosen. The reader is called back. 
The writer with a pointed, pencil or stick of wood, makes 
various maneuvers on the floor, wall, or table, the reader 
watching intently. ‘‘Can you follow me?’’ says the writer 
after a bit of mysterious maneuvering. After more of this 
he taps once, then with a grand flourish finishes up, saying, 
“‘That’s all.’? Immediately the reader says, ‘‘Cat.’? Note 
that the consonants are given by what is said, the first 
letter in the sentence indicating the letter written. Thus 
when the writer says, ‘‘Can you follow me?’’ the other 
knows immediately that the letter is ‘‘C.’’ The vowels 
are a, e,i, 0, u. Therefore 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 taps indicate which 
vowel is to be used. On tap is ‘‘a,’’ two taps ‘‘b,”’ ete. 
The more mysterious you can make your maneuvering with 
the pointer, the better; for, although it has nothing to do 
with your writing of the word, it is to your advantage to 
make them think it has. We have seen a company com- 
pletely mystified by this stunt. If any one thinks he has 
 
-P-A-G-E-355
PHUNOLOGY 345 
gotten it, let him go out and then come back and read the 
word selected. Often players will guess the consonants, 
but are unable to fathom your vowel system. 
Com 44; Pe ER RACE 
Each contestant is Pon in enh one for each 
foot. He places one newspaper forward and steps on it 
with the right foot. Then he picks up the other and steps 
forward on it and so on, being allowed to step only on 
newspaper. The race is to a given line and back. 
  
\cebvea ve eee RACE 
Select several contestants for this race. Place a number 
of obstacles in the race course—buckets, books, cups, 
tumblers, ete. Let the contestants try the course once. 
Then blindfold them, have some one noiselessly remove all 
the obstacles, and start your race. If this is done cleverly 
enough, the contestants will do some ludicrous high-step- 
ping to avoid- knocking over or touching any of the 
obstacles, since one of the rules laid down was that each 
obstacle touched counts one demerit against the racer. 
The contestants must walk and not run. 
  
ORATORICAL CONTEST 
Let three young men impersonate three prominent 
orators. State that, as the hour is late, they will save time 
by all speaking at once. Hach of the three should have 
previously committed his speech, and when he has taken 
his place on the platform he will frantically endeavor to 
make himself heard above the others. To make the per-

formance more amusing, they should make all sorts of 
dramatic and ridiculous gestures. (If you can get three 
persons of ready tongue, it will add to the fun if the 
speeches are extemporaneous affairs.) —Miss M. LE. Dixon. 
PENNY FORTUNE 
This is a dandy hoax to work on unsuspecting victims. 
You call in these victims one at a time with the ostensible 
purpose of telling their fortunes with a penny. You tell 
them that you will wet the penny in a pan of water, press 
it to their foreheads, informing them that the number of 
shakes it takes to make the coin drop will indicate the 
fortune. You let them try it just to see how it works. 
You then begin by asking the penny: ‘‘How many times 
will she (he) be married?’’ The penny is dipped into 
the water and then pressed to the forehead of the victim, 
who begins to shake her head. Possibly it will be shaken 
off in the second attempt, indicating she will be married 
twice. ‘‘How many children will she (he) have?’’ The 
penny is again pressed to the forehead, and the person 
begins to shake the head. At the second or third shake 
the penny will probably fall to her lap. Now ask some 
such question as, ‘‘How many quarrels will she have with 
her husband?’’ or ‘‘How many times will she wish she 
hadn’t married?’’ This time press the wet penny to the 
forehead, but remove it, holding it hidden in the hand. 
The wet impression made will cause the victim to think 
the penny is there, as in the previous tests. Gales of 
laughter will greet the performance as the victim shakes 
the head time after time before realizing that a trick is 
being played on her.

each young man grabs his satchel, and hand in hand he and 
his partner rush to the opposite goal. Arrived there, he 
opens the satchel, hands his partner her rubbers, which 
she puts on, hands her her gloves, which she like likewise 
puts on, holds her coat for her while she gets into it, closes 
the satchel, raises the umbrella, and, holding the umbrella 
over her with one hand and the satchel with the other, 
runs with her back to the starting point. Arrived there, 
he must close up the umbrella, open the satchel, help his 
partner out of the coat, take the gloves and rubbers as she

., RELAY STRING-WINDING. 
Compe tit ive Bur [oy @ string The' company divides into two groups, lining up in two

needed and two sticks on which to wind the string. One 
each of these is handed to the head player in each line. At 
a given signal each drops the ball to the ground and be-

gins to wind the string on the stick. <A leader stands out 
in front of the two lines and directs the game: When he 
taps a bell or blows a whistle the player winding must pass 
‘the stick to the player immediately behind and rush to the 
rear of the line. Each player winds feverishly when the 
stick is handed to him, the idea being to see which side 
ean first get its ball of cord wound on the stick. The 
leader should signal for a change every minute or half 
minute. Tangles must not be wound on the stick, but 
must be untangled before proceeding with the winding. 
  
SPANISH RELAY 
Teams of five or more may contest in this relay. Two 
canes or closed umbrellas are needed, or as many as there 
are teams. These are rested on the floor or ground by the 
first man on each team. Both hands are placed on top 
and the forehead rested on the hands. In this position, 
at the signal to start, each leader is required to turn 
around four times without lifting the cane from the ground. 
He must then stand suddenly erect and run to and around 
a tree, chair, or pole some short distance away, and back to 
his own group, handing the cane to the next man in line, 
who immediately goes through the same process. The 
first team finishing, of course, wins. The actions of some 
of the runners will be worth going miles to see. 
  
THE SIAMESE LANGUAGE 
The young people one at a time, or, if the crowd is large, 
several at a time, are brought before the teacher to learn 
this difficult language. All others are excluded unless they 
are already familiar with it. The pupil is brought in and 
led to a seat opposite the teacher, who will proceed to ask
-P-A-G-E-359
  PHUNOLOGY 349 
if they have ever studied Latin or French, explaining that 
the Siamese language is taught by the method of induction, 
the pupil learning a basic sentence, after which the rest of 
the language comes easy, so that the next time the pupil 
meets the Siamese twins he may be able to converse 
with them in their native tongue. He now requires the 
pupil to repeat after him, one at a time, the following 
syllables: ‘‘O-WA (a as in father) -TA-GOO-SIAM.”’ 
Now the pupil is asked to repeat these by coupling two 
syllables, ‘‘OWA-TAGOO-SIAM.”’ Then the pupil is 
asked to repeat the entire sentence, practicing it for 
smoothness. Let him repeat the sentence several times, 
the teacher encouraging him by saying, ‘‘That’s right,’’ or 
something of the sort. Ask him now if he can interpret it, , 
if he hasn’t already caught on. It may take him quite a 
while to realize that he is saying, ‘‘O what a goose I am!”’ 
As the pupils learn the language they are privileged to stay 
in the room and witness the teaching of those who follow. — 
SPOON PHOTOGRAPHY 
Players sit in a circle. The photographer leaves the 
room, and one of the players is chosen to have ‘‘his like- - 
ness took.’’ The players also choose some one from the 
crowd to hold the spoon in front of this person for a 
moment, handing it to the photographer on his return. He 
polishes the bowl of the spoon, passes it around, reflecting 
several faces in the bowl, and finally names the one chosen 
in his absence, stopping when that person’s face is reflected 
in the spoon. A confederate is necessary for this stunt. 
This confederate assumes the exact position of the player 
chosen. The photographer, of course, pretends to see the 
image in the spoon.

responsibility in the make-up of the paper. The Tattler 
will carry newsy items about the League and its members, 
making clever hits on some of them. It will have a joke 
eolumn, giving the jokes a local flavor, editorials, humor- 
ous or otherwise, bits of poetry, burlesque advertisements, 
police court news, and sporting page. The news items will 
be ‘‘faked,’’ of course. There will also be a Beatrice 
Barefacts column, where questions of lovelorn young 
people get attention. The paper is not to be printed, but 
written and read to the assembled company. If used at 
the monthly social or the business meeting and cleverly 
done, it will become a feature looked forward to with much 
interest. 
  
TELLTALE TUMBLER 
Place a tumbler on a table. On top of it place a coin, 
handkerchief, or something else suitable. Tell the company 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  852 PHUNOLOGY 
that you’ll leave the room while some one removes the coin 
or handkerchief from the tumbler. When instructed to do 
so you will come back, and the tumbler will tell you who 
removed the coin or handkerchief. Each one on your re- 
turn must walk up and put the forefinger of the right hand 
on the tumbler. When they have all done so, you will hold 
the tumbler to your ear and listen intently. After a moment 
of this you walk directly to the person who has removed . 
thecoin or handkerchief and ask for it. The secret lies 
in the fact that a secret confederate always places his 
finger on the tumbler immediately following the guilty 
person. 
  
WATCH TRICK 
Ask some person to think of some number on the dial 
of a watch or clock. Before a large crowd you might use 
a cardboard imitation of the face of a watch. Tell the 
person selecting the number to count as you tap on the 
face of the clock, beginning to count at the number next 
succeeding the one selected and counting to twenty, letting 
you know when twenty has been reached. Thus if ‘‘five’’ 
is selected, he counts ‘‘six, seven, eight,’’ ete. You will be 
pointing at the number selected when twenty is reached. 
You must count also as you tap. It does not matter on 
what numbers the tapping is done up to seven in your 
count, but on eight you must start at twelve and tap in 
reverse order, thus: Twelve, eleven, ten, ete. When twenty 
is reached in the count of the person selecting the number, 
invariably you will be pointing to the number selected.

boy is given an envelope containing the name of some well- 
known song. At a given signal he breaks open the seal, 
reads what is on the paper, runs across the room to his 
partner, and whistles the tune of the song in her ear. As 
soon as she recognizes it she must write it on another slip 
of paper in her possession and hand it to him folded. He 
immediately returns to the starting point. The boy re- 
turning first with the correct title of the song he whistled 
written on the paper is winner. 
  
YANKEE DOODLE DOMESTICS 
Persons appear on the platform in old-fashioned or 
ridiculous costume. Hach begins doing some bit of house- 
work. One will dust, another sweep, another pretend to 
wash dishes, passing the imaginary dishes along to an- 
other, who goes through the motions of wiping them, an- — 
other washes clothes, another scrubs the floor, another 
kneads dough, ete. All this is done to the accompaniment 
of ‘*Yankee Doodle’’ played on a piano. The players be- 
gin slowly, increasing their speed as the music becomes 
faster and faster, until every one is at high speed, when 
the music gradually slows down until each person is barely 
moving, finally coming to a dead stop.

CHAPTER XIX 
RELAYS 
1. Spanish Relay —(See ‘‘Stunts.’’) 
2. All-Up Relay.—Have two or more teams of five or 
more members each contest. Opposite the first man on 
each team and across the room is drawn a circle about two 
feet in diameter. Inside each of these circles stand three 
Indian clubs or long bottles. At the signal to go these men 
run to their respective circles and set the clubs or bottles 
just outside, returning immediately this is accomplished 
and ‘‘touching off’’ (slapping outstretched hand) the man 
next in line. This man has moved up to the starting point, 
and immediately on being ‘‘touched off’’ starts for the 
circle and replaces the clubs or bottles within the circle. 
And so on until all the players of one team have completed 
the course. A player is compelled to have all the clubs or 
bottles standing upright before he can run back to the 
starting point. Should one fall, he must go back and set 
it up before he can proceed further. 
3. Blackboard Relay—Two or more teams. The last 
player in each line runs to the board and writes one word. 
‘When he returns he hands the chalk to the one immediately 
in front of his position. This player writes another word, 
and so on till all the players have run. The words written 
must bear some relation and form a sentence when finished 
by the last player torun. This player must also punctuate 
it before he returns. Twenty-five points are allowed for 
speed, twenty-five for spelling, twenty-five for writing, 
3854
-P-A-G-E-365
PHUNOLOGY 355 
twenty-five for punctuation and grammatical construction. 
This game may be varied by having the participants hop 
to the board and write one letter each of a given word. 
In this case the side first writing the word and returning 
to,the starting point wins. 
vi 4. Hopping Relay.—Two or more teams line up their 
players behind the starting line. At the signal they must 
hop to a goal line some ten or fifteen feet away, touch the 
goal with the hands, and hop back to ‘‘touch off’’ the first 
player in line, who proceeds to do the same thing, and so 
on. The team whose last player reaches the starting line 
first wins. 
. Shuttle Relay—Half the players for each side line 
up at opposite sides of the room, of course. The first 
players start from one side, hopping the distance and tag- 
ging the first of their team-mates on the other side. This 
team-mate hops back to opposite side and ‘‘touches oft’’ the 
next man in line, and so on. The idea is to see which team 
can have all its players finish the course first in this 
manner. 
6. Japanese Crab Race.—The players line up behind the 
starting line in several single files, each team with the same 
number of players. Opposite each line is a circle at a 
distance of about ten yards. The players have to race 
backward on all fours to the circle, stand erect, and rush 
back to touch the outstretched hand of the next team-mate 
as he crosses the line. The start is made by the first 
player in each line getting in position, with heels on the 
starting line, and back to the circle for which he is to run. 
The next player in line immediately gets into position when 
his team-mate starts back for the touch-off. This race may 
also be run without using the relay idea. In this case a 
team scores a point each time its contestant is victorious 
over an oponent in reaching the circle on all fours. No 
return is necessary. The next two players start immediately 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  356 PHUNOLOGY 
the first two are out of the way, and so on until every one 
has had a chance to display his skill. 
7. Chair Relay.—Two long rows of chairs. The leaders 
on each side run around their own rows and back to their 
places. On their return, as soon as they are seated, the 
second player runs around the chairs, including the leader’s 
chair. Then the third and so on. 
_ 8. Spoon Relay.—Two rows of players line up, facing 
one another. Two tables are placed between the rows at 
either end of the line. Six spoons are placed on each table. 
Each person in line grasps with his left hand the right 
wrist of the person to his left, leaving the right hand of 
each person free. The leaders at opposite ends of the 
opposing sides at the signal start passing spoons, one at a 
time, down their respective lines. The side able to pass 
the spoons down and back first wins. Only the right hands 
ean be used, and the line must not break hold anywhere. 
If a spoon drops, to avoid breaking grips the whole line 
must stoop while it is picked up. 
9. Barrel Hoop Relay.—Four contestants from each side. 
Each team is given a barrel hoop. At the signal to ‘‘Go’’ 
the first player for each team passes the hoop over the 
entire body, steps out, and passes it on to the next, who 
repeats the performance, then passing it on to the third, 
and so on. 
| 10. Folding-Chair Relay—The teams line up, four con- 
testants for each team. A folding chair is placed un- 
opened on the goal line. Each contestant, running from 
the starting point, must run to the chair, open it, sit on it, 
close it, get back to the starting point, and ‘‘touch off’’ 
his team-mate, who is to run next. The team whose last 
contestant sits in his team’s chair wins. The others may 
fight it out for second and third places. 
11, Apple Relay—Have four contestants for each of 
several teams. The leader of each team is given an apple.
-P-A-G-E-367
PHUNOLOGY 357 
At the signal to start the leader pares the apple; the second 
one cuts it in halves; the third quarters it and cut out the 
core; the fourth eats it and crows like a rooster to indicate 
that he has finished. 
12. Yankee Doodle Relay.—Have four girls and four 
boys represent each team. Hach girl is provided with a 
glass half full of water, and a teaspoon. At the signal to 
begin the first girl on each team begins feeding her partner 
the water, teaspoonful at a time. As soon as this couple 
finish they must sing a verse and chorus of ‘‘Yankee 
Doodle,’’ at the end of which the next couple may begin 
to do away with the water, and so on down the line. The 
team finishing first marches around the other team, singing 
‘*Yankee Doodle.’? Where more than two teams are con- 
testing, the teams may march about the sides still engaged 
in the order in which they finish. 
[f13. Weaver’s Relay.—Two or more circles, with same 
number of players in each. Players clasp hands. One on 
each team is chosen as starter and drops back. At the 
signal each starter begins racing, going into the circle 
under one pair of arms and out through the next, and so 
on all the way around till he reaches his own place, when 
the player to his right begins. The circle whose last player 
returns to his position first wins. 
mi 14. Penny Relay.——Divide the company into two equal 
sides, with an uneven number of players on each side. Let 
them sit in two lines, facing one another. At either end of 
both lines have tables. On the table by the leader of each 
line are five pennies. At a given signal each leader picks 
up a penny and puts it in the hands of the next player. 
This player must stretch his hands straight out in front of 
him, with palms up and close together. The next player 
now picks it up from the outstretched hands and places 
it in the outstretched hands of the fourth player. Thus 
every other player sits with outstretched hands, making 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
         358 PHUNOLOGY 
no move to help the progress of the pennies. Soon each 
leader will have all five pennies on their way to the other 
end of the line. The last player to receive them places 
them on the table at his end and, after getting all five 
pennies on the table, starts them back up the line. The 
first side getting the pennies home wins. 
15. Chinese Hop Relay.—Line up ten players for each 
team. Arrange as many rows of sticks, ten in a row, as 
there are teams. Place them in easy hopping distance. 
Have the teams lined up behind the starting line, which 
may be several yards from the first stick. At the signal 
the first player in each line hops from the starting line 
and over all the sticks, picking up the last stick, hopping 
back, and ‘‘touching off’’ the next player, who has moved 
up to his position. This player must get stick No. 9 in 
the same manner, and so on. The first team to have all 
ten of its sticks home wins. : 
16. Banana Relay, or Italian Ensemble-—Have three or 
four members for each team. Line them up on the plat- 
form, facing the crowd. Provide each contestant with a 
banana. At the given signal the first man on each team 
peels his banana and eats it. He must then shout, ‘‘Vive 
la Italia! Vive la America!’’ before his next team-mate 
ean begin. The team wins whose last man finishes his 
banana and shouts as required before his opponents have 
finished. 
17. Potato Race Relay——Put down as many rows of five 
potatoes each as there are teams. The potatoes should be 
placed three or four feet apart. The distance will be 
governed largely, however, by the amount of room you have 
at your disposal. Have the teams line up at the starting 
point. Give the first runner on each team a teaspoon. At 
the signal to go this player starts picking up the potatoes 
with the spoon and carrying them back ore at a time to a 
chair on the starting line. No use of the hands or fingers 
   
-P-A-G-E-369
  PHUNOLOGY 359 
may be made to get the potatoes on the spoon, excepting, 
of course, as the hands are used to hold the spoon. When 
all the potatoes have been brought back in this manner, 
the next player on the team picks up the potatoes with his 
hands one at a time and sets them out. The next player 
on his return starts out with the spoon to carry them all 
back. The fourth player sets them out again, and the fifth 
picks them up with the spoon and carries them back to the 
chair. Line up a team of girls against a team of boys in 
this relay. It may also be run by having the first runner 
pick up the first potato with the spoon, deposit it in the 
chair, and hand the spoon to a team-mate, who gets potato 
No. 2, the next getting No. 3, and so on. This race may be 
run without the relay feature, allowing two or more persons 
to contest to see which one can pick up and carry all the 
potatoes in the shortest time. 
18. Hobble Skirt Hurdle Relay—Run the Hobble Skirt 
Hurdle Race, as described elsewhere, in relay fashion, with 
teams of three or four each contesting. 
CG \79. Walking Relay—No running allowed. Teams of 
five or more. All contestants walk to a given point and 
back, ‘‘touching off’’ the next teammate as they reach the 
starting line. 
20. Cracker Relay.—As described in the ‘‘Track Meet 
Social.’’ 
21. Overhead Relay—Have two or more long lines of 
players, with the same number in each line. Give the leader 
of each line a basket ball, volley ball, or bean bag. At the 
signal to go each leader passes the ball back over his head, 
and so on down the line it goes. When the last man in 
line has received it, the line reverses, and he starts it back 
down the line in the same manner, with the overhead pass. 
Each player must handle the ball. The idea is to see which 
team can pass it down and back to the leader first. 
22. Bean Bag Relay.—Two teams. They line up, facing 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
  360 PHUNOLOGY 
one another, with at least five yards between the lines. All 
players are seated but two. These two, one for each side, 
stand midway between the chairs at either end of each line 
and some several fect in front of the line. Hach has a bean 
bag. At the signal to go this middleman, whom we will call 
No. 1, throws the bean bag to No. 2, at one end of his line 
of players. No. 2 immediately on the word ‘‘Go’’ has 
assumed a standing position. He catches the bean bag and 
rushes to take No. 1’s position as middleman. No. 1, im- 
mediately on throwing the bean bag, runs to the other end 
of his line and seats himself in the end chair, all the 
players having moved up one seat as soon as No. 2 went 
to the middle. No. 2 proceeds to throw to No. 3 as soon 
as he reaches the middleman’s position, and then rushes te 
the other end while No. 3 takes his place as middleman, and 
so on it goes. The idea is to see which team can go all the 
way around and get the original middleman back to his 
position first. All players must catch the bean bag while 
in standing position. 
23. Stride Ball Relay—Here’s a relay for boys. Two or 
more lines of players stand straddle. The leader of each 
line is given a basket ball, football, volley ball, or bean 
bag. He passes the ball back between his feet. When it 
gets to the end, players reverse and pass it back to the 
leader. Each player must handle the ball. 
24, Right-Left Relay.—Two or more lines of equal num- 
ber of players, with line-up similar to ‘‘Overhead Relay’”’ 
line-up. The leader passes the ball, or whatever may be 
used, back from his right side, half turning to do it and 
using both hands in passing. The second player then 
passes it from his left side, the next right, and so on. 
Reverse and send back in same manner. 
25. Lemon Race Relay.—As described in the chapter on 
‘Miscellaneous Stunts.’’

Get Acquainted. To Get Partners. 
Forfeits. 
  
GET ACQUAINTED 
Zip.—Seat the company in a circle. One player stands 
in the center. Each player in the circle acquaints him- 
self immediately with the name of the person to his left. 
The person in the center points his finger at any one in the 
cirele and shouts: ‘‘One, two, three, four, five, zip!’’ 
While he is thus shouting the person to whom he points 
must say the name of the person to his left before ‘‘Zip’’ 
is said. Failing to do this, he must exchange places with 
the player in the center. The game continues and should 
move rapidly. 
Mixed Quartets—Copy and cut into four pieces two or 
more lines of some familiar song. Distribute these pieces 
through the crowd and have them match until each group 
is complete. Have them render their songs, it matters not 
if there isn’t a singer or musician in the group. All in 
the group must take part. After each group has per- 
- formed, let them sing together, each group singing its own 
song. This will be horrible, of course, but it will be lots of 
fun just the same. 
Circle Shake—Players form a circle. One person is 
designated to start off by shaking hands with the person 
to his right and proceeding on around the circle, shaking 
361 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  362 . PHUNOLOGY 
hands in turn with each one and returning finally to his 
place. The next person to him follows him, and the next, 
and next, and so on, each shaking hands and giving his 
or her name, until every one in the circle has been around 
once. 
Song Scramble—Give out songs cut so that two lines 
appear on each slip. The players scramble about until 
each group has its song complete; when all groups are com- 
pleted, in turn they must render their song. A variation 
of this is to number the slips. Thus all slips of one song 
would be numbered 1, of another 2, and so on. 
Circle Confab.—Get company in two concentric circles, 
boys on outside, girls on inside. Let them march to music, 
the circles going in opposite directions. When the music 
stops, the marchers stop, face one another, and converse 
till the music starts. If introductions are necessary, of 
course each introduces himself or herself to the other be- 
fore conversing. When the music starts up, the players 
begin marching again. The pianist should make frequent 
stops, but never long ones. The players may march in the 
same direction. When the music stops, each man should 
then move forward one. The game will continue until 
each person has met and conversed with every other person. 
The Jolly Miller makes a good mixing game. It is de- 
‘scribed in the chapter on ‘‘Games.’’ 
Grouping —Have players group by months of birth, by 
initials of surname, by native States, by height, tall or 
short, ete. 
Number Mixer—Give each one a number to be pinned 
in a conspic place, then give out slips upon which are 
written directions, such as the following: ‘‘Shake hands 
with five and nine.’’ ‘‘Introduce four to three.’’? ‘‘Go 
to-seven and shake hands three ways—Chinese fashion, 
society grip, and Methodist fashion.’’ ‘‘Kneel before eleven 
and meow like a cat three times.”’

I. C. Mizxer—Give each guest four sheets of paper 
marked ‘‘Blue Eyes,’’ ‘‘Brown Eyes,’’ ‘‘Black Eyes,’’ and 
“‘Gray Eyes,’’ respectively. They are now instructed to 
shake hands with every one and write their names on the 
proper sheet. 
“Secret Hand Shaker—Announce that some one in the 
crowd has been chosen as Secret Hand Shaker. The tenth 
person to shake hands with that person will get a prize. 
The thirteenth, twentieth, or any other number may be 
chosen as the lucky one. 
Introduction Committee —Have an introduction commit- 
tee for each social to see that every one is made to feel 
at home and introduced to everybody else. This‘ committee 
ean do wonders in creating that atmosphere of good fellow- 
ship so necessary to the making of a successful social. 
Pinning on Names.—It is always a good: idea in crowds 
where a number are unacquainted to pin the names of the 
guests on the lapel of the coat or on the waist, where every- 
body can see them.

ing a different word and making a different gesture. 
18. Sing ‘‘My Country, ’Tis of Thee,’’ dropping every 
fourth word. 
19. Recite ‘‘Mary had a little lamb’’ dramatically. 
20. Bow to the wittiest, make ‘‘goo-goo’’ eyes at the 
prettiest, and kneel to the one you love the best.

Birthday Social. Playgrounds. 
Debate. The Booth Festival. 
A Pageant of Nations. The Annual Banquet.

(Note: The suggestions in this chapter are especially 
appropriate for large gatherings where one club or society, 
Sunday school or League is entertaining a number of 
similar organizations from other parts of the city.) 
There are four good reasons for City Union Socials: 
1. They increase the spirit of good fellowship among 
the Epworth Leaguers of the city. 
2. They tend to develop what we might call esprit de 
corps, that ‘‘all-pull-together’’ spirit that means so much 
to the Union’s success. 
8. They demonstrate methods of entertaining to our 
workers. 
4. They enliven the interest in Union meetings. 
  
SURPRISE STUNTS 
We know one City Union that made a different Chapter 
responsible for some surprise stunt at the close of each 
monthly meeting. This feature proved quite popular. 
369
-P-A-G-E-380
370 PHUNOLOGY 
“EATS” 
Another City Union felt that ‘‘eats’’ were important 
enough to have some sort of refreshments at the close of 
each monthly meeting. Thus on one occasion each person 
got an apple and a pop corn ball; on another, an ice cream 
cone; on another, it was frappé and cake. Nothing elabor- 
ate or expensive was attempted. 
  
A SEASONABLE AFFAIR 
At one City Union meeting, after the program in the 
main auditorium, the members repaired to the Sunday 
school room. Here they were divided into four groups, 
according to the season of the year in which they were 
born. 
Hach group gathered at its headquarters, all of which 
were decorated appropriately. (See Season Social for 
January.) 
They then participated in a ‘‘yell-’em-up,’’ the standing 
broad smile, the cracker relay, the baby Marathon, and an 
Italian jazz race (blind banana feed). All these stunts 
are described elsewhere in this book. 
  
BIRTHDAY SOCIAL 
One City Union entertained with a big birthday party. 
Twelve tables had been arranged by representatives from 
twelve different Chapters. Hach table represented a month. 
January was a beautiful all-white creation; February 
featured George Washington and Valentine; March, St. 
Patrick; April, Easter (a shower effect can also be obtained 
by cutting long thin strips of white paper and hanging 
them over the table); May, a Maypole, with tiny dolls as 
   
-P-A-G-E-381
PHUNOLOGY 871 
the children; June, a profusion of roses; July, patriotic 
combinations; August, seashore, using a mirror, sand, tiny 
dolls in bathing suits, toy spades, ete.; September, a paste- 
board schoolhouse, with walk, trees, doll school children, 
ete.; October, Hallowe’en; November, turkey, football; 
December, Christmas. 
Each person was asked to find the table representing 
the month of his birth. Each group was then expected to 
put on some stunt. 
DEBATE 
Have a debate between representatives chosen at large 
from the city or between two Chapters. It may be either 
of serious or humorous nature. For instance, we know one 
City Union that debated the question, ‘‘Resolved, that old 
maids are of more benefit to the community than old 
bachelors.’’ 
Somz Sussects ror DrBatE 
Resolved: That the social side of the Young Peoples 
Society is of equal importance with the spiritual side. 
Resolved: That the Church should urge the shortening 
by legislation of the hours of labor for workingmen to the 
lowest practicable point. 
Resolved: That home missions are more important than 
foreign missions. 
Resolved: That wealth is a greater hindrance than 
poverty to the Christian life. 
Resolved: That public utilities, such as street railways, 
lighting and water systems should be owned and operated 
by municipalities. ( 
Resolved: That the railroads should be operated under 
government ownership.
-P-A-G-E-382
  372 PHUNOLOGY 
Resolved: That the telephone and telegraph systems 
should be operated under government ownership. 
Resolved: That the initiative and referendum should be 
adopted by legislation as a national policy. 
Resolved: That indifference is a greater hindrance to 
progress and reform than active opposition. 
  
A PAGEANT OF NATIONS 
There are big possibilities in a Pageant of Nations for a 
City Union. One of the larger churches should be selected 
for this social affair. It will really be more of a display 
than a pageant. 
Attractive booths should be arranged for different 
nations. For instance, there might be an African booth, 
presided over by young men made up as native Christians 
and a girl in white and gold to represent the missionary. 
An attractive little African village display can be secured 
from Lamar & Barton. 
Japan’s booth could be made very attractive with lan- 
terns, pink paper cherry blossoms, ete. The young ladies 
presiding over this booth will make themselves up ‘‘Jap- 
anesey’’ with kimonos, the use of small fans in the hair, ete. 
China’s color scheme would be yellow. Elaborate tunics 
might be fixed up for those who preside over this booth. 
Possibly you could borrow several Mandarin coats from 
folks in the town. The gentlemen should wear skullcaps 
and pigtails, which could be made out of rope blackened 
and sewed on to the skullcap. Mark imitation Chinese 
characters in large black figures on yellow paper, which 
decorates the walls of your booth. A few Chinese lanterns 
may be used. 
France, England, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and Cuba might 
be represented.  
-P-A-G-E-383
  
PHUNOLOGY 378 
Of course one booth would represent America, with 
Columbia, Uncle Sam, and a group of soldier boys having 
charge. : 
Appoint a general committee to make arrangements and 
execute the plans. This committee will assign to different 
Chapters in the Union responsibility for certain booths. 
All the curios possible should be gathered to use in the 
booth displays—charts, posters, neatly arranged pictures, 
and placards set forth striking missionary facts about each 
country. 
Refreshments may be served at each booth, making a 
small charge to defray expenses, if necessary. Each booth 
would serve something in keeping with the country rep- 
resented. Thus Italy could serve bananas; Japan, tea; 
China, rice cakes; France, grape juice. 
A DOLL PAGEANT 
A doll pageant is a possibility. The whole affair would 
be carried out after the fashion of the Pageant of Nations, 
the dolls being dressed in native costume for each booth. 
A DEMONSTRATION SOCIAL 
A demonstration social might be put on as a City Union 
feature for social chairman and their committees. The 
social chairman for the Union would call a preliminary 
meeting of all Chapter Social Committee Chairmen to plan 
for the social. In this meeting the plans would be made 
just as they should be made by social committees for Chap- 
ter socials. The City Union chairman should seek to im- 
press every one present with the importance of using the 
social committees and demonstrate just how it is done. 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  
  374 PHUNOLOGY 
Definite tasks should be assigned each one. For instance, 
there will be a Committee in Charge of Decoration, a Com- 
mittee on Refreshments, a Get-Acquainted and Greeting 
Committee, ete. 
As this social is for the purpose of demonstration, you 
should put on the best one you possibly can. 
SINGSONG. 
The popularity and use of the community singsong dur- 
ing the war suggests big possibilities along that line in 
times of peace. An occasional singsong could be made a big 
social success if a good leadex can be secured. Popular 
songs, the old standard favorites, ‘‘pep’’ songs, and hymns 
would make up a program that would mean a rousing 
good time. 
  
A WRITING GAME—ALL SORTS OF PORTS 
1. What kind of port is suitable for Bolshevists? De- 
port. 
2. What kind of port is fit for kings? Port Royal. 
3. What kind of port is suitable for fat people? Portly. 
4. What kind of port pleases any president? Support. 
5. What kind of port tickles a district secretary? Re- 
port. 
ATHLETICS 
A City Union Athletic Association is another possibility. 
Baseball and basketball leagues could be organized. Hach 
Chapter would have its baseball and basketball teams. In 
a Jarge City Union it might be necessary to have several, 
grouping the Chapters by districts. Or there could be one
-P-A-G-E-385
  
PHUNOLOGY 376 
representative team from each district. A player’s 
eligibility would be determined by membership in the 
Chapter and attendance upon the devotional meeting at 
least twice a month. 
A tennis tournament could also be arranged to determine 
the champion tennis player in singles as well as to de- 
termine the champions in doubles. Hach Chapter would 
have to conduct its own tennis series to determine on its 
representatives in the tournament. 
In athletics the Chapters must stand flat-footed for clean 
sports, and the rivalry, however keen, must be good- 
natured, else harm instead of good will result. Adopt 
‘“elean sports and good-natured rivalry’’ as your slogan 
and insist upon them as absolutely essential. 
  
PLAYGROUNDS 
In a city where there are no playgrounds what better 
service could the City Union perform than to equip and 
conduct a playground for the youth of the city? Or, asa 
next best idea, why not agitate the matter until the city 
provides playgrounds? An inquiry sent to the Playground 
and Recreation Association of America, New York, will 
bring whatever information you may need. 
  
THE BOOTH FESTIVAL 
Some of the City Unions and district organizations of 
the Epworth League of the Methodist Episcopal Church 
have an annual affair they call the Booth Festival. The 
plans for this festival revolve around three centers: First, 
a District Field Day, to be held the first Monday in 
September or at any other convenient time; second, some 
charitable institution, such as a Methodist hospital or
-P-A-G-E-386
376 PHUNOLOGY 
orphanage, etc., is selected to be the recipient of the 
vegetables, fruits, canned goods, ete.; third, preliminary 
preparation in the individual Chapters, including the 
planting and cultivation of gardens, berrying parties, 
soliciting of fruits and vegetables, and preliminary prepara- 
tion for the athletic events on the big Field Day. At- 
tractive booths are fitted up by each Chapter, displaying 
its offering of fruits and vegetables as attractively as pos- 
sible. Or displays may be made by groups of Leagues. 
Ribbon awards may be made for the best displays. Some- 
times the festival idea has been used in connection with the 
district institute. 
A suggested program for the big Field Day follows: 
9:00 to 10:00. Assembling of Leaguers, bringing fruits, 
vegetables, etc., and arranging them in the booths. 
10:00 to 12:00. Games and contests, races, ete. 
12:00 to 1:30. Picnic dinner and rest hour. 
1:30 to 3:00. Conference on plans for fall work, busi- 
ness session, etc. 
3:00 to 4.30. Baseball between the two best teams in 
the district. Basketball game for girls. 
4:30 to 5:00. Tug of war. 
5:00 to 6:00. Rest. 
6:00 to 6:45. Supper. 
7:00. Singsong, stunts, ete. An address may be used 
for the evening’s program if desired. 
  
THE ANNUAL BANQUET 
There is much value to the annual banquet idea. Every 
City Union ought to get together in this manner once a 
year. 
An elaborate menu is not necessary, but the program 
should be one to arouse enthusiasm to a high pitch. 
It is well to steer clear of long-winded gentlemen. In 
   
-P-A-G-E-387
PHUNOLOGY 377 
fact, the toastmaster should see to it that every speaker 
keeps within his time limit. Put no one on the program 
just to tickle his vanity. Four or five ten- or fifteen- 
minute speeches full of ‘‘pep’’ and practical ideas are bet- 
ter than three long-winded oratorical efforts. One feature 
speaker may lend strength to your program, but even he 
should be expected to say what he has to say in twenty or 
twenty-five minutes. 
Tie the program up to some definite forward movement. 
The banquet ought to furnish the impetus to swing all 
your forces out into line, with every member enthusiastic 
for the fray. 
Make good use of ‘‘pep’’ songs and yells. Intersperse 
the evening’s program with spontaneous outbursts of this 
nature. 
PICNICS AND OUTINGS 
The City Union should have a big Fourth-of-July picnic, 
with one or two patriotic addresses, some games, fireworks, 
balloons, ete. 
One City Union had a four days’ camp at a suitable 
near-by place. Here they lived in real camping style, had 
some institute work on methods every day, possibly a 
vesper service about the camp fire, and a glorious good 
time for the whole of the week, with swimming, canoeing, 
fishing, hiking, and kodaking through the day and music 
and games for evening entertainment. 
Linked up with the picnic idea, a City Union could put 
on a big Field Day, with contests of all sorts, races, tennis, 
baseball, ete. 
One City Union, located on a river, has an annual moon- 
light excursion, which is looked forward to as the big social 
event of the summer. It also serves to replenish the Union 
treasury.

  BANQUETS 
Committees Military Banquet 
A Rainbow Banquet An Indian Banquet 
Japanese Garden Banquet An Aviation Banquet 
Football Banquet A Birthday Banquet 
Thanksgiving Banquet Miscellaneous Programs 
COMMITTEES 
The following committees should be appointed to take 
charge of certain phases of the work attendant upon get- 
ting up an annual banquet: 
The Menu Committee is a very important one, and this 
responsibility should be in the hands of capable persons. 
This committee must have at least two meetings. In the 
first meeting suggestions on menus are made and discussed, 
and different ones are appointed to see what prices they can 
get on certain things. At the second meeting reports are 
made and final decision is made on the menu, after dis- 
cussing cost, number likely to be present, ete. <A definite 
report on the number to be present should be required a 
day or two before the banquet. 
The Decoration Committee takes care of this important 
feature, making the tables and surroundings as beautiful 
and attractive as possible. 
Committee on Table Arrangements——This committee has 
the job of seeing that enough tables are provided and de- 
cides in consultation with the Committee on Decorations 
379 
   
-P-A-G-E-390
380 PHUNOLOGY 
about the arrangement of the tables. For instance, they 
may arrange them in the shape of a Maltese cross or of the 
Roman cross, or they may form the initial letter of the 
name of the president of the Chapter, class, or club, or 
the name of the honored guest may thus be indicated. 
The Committee on Program and Music performs the im- 
portant function of arranging the program, getting the 
speakers, music, ete. 
A Ticket Committee should be appointed to distribute or 
sell tickets. This committee should be ready to report on 
the number accepting invitations or buying tickets at least 
a day before the banquet occasion. This is absolutely 
necessary so that the Menu Committee will know for how 
many to prepare. 
The above plan presupposes that the food is to be pre- 
pared and served by the members of the organization. 
Another plan is that of getting a local caterer to serve 
the banquet. The same committees would be necessary 
as in the first plan, but the duties of the Menu Committee 
would be much lighter. This committee will get prices 
from several caterers before making its decision. 
Still another plan is to hold the banquet at a hotel or 
other banquet hall at so much a plate. In this event the 
Menu Committee gets menus and prices from several hotels 
before closing a contract. 
A RAINBOW BANQUET 
Let the seven prismatic colors form your color scheme. 
Make a huge rainbow over to one side. Use crépe paper in 
prismatic combination to make long streamers reaching 
to the tables, ete. Have seven speakers on your program 
for five-minute talks on the following themes: 
1. The Violet’s Message (fellowship, constancy) or 
Royal Purple (the kingship of Jesus in our lives).
-P-A-G-E-391
  PHUNOLOGY 381 
2. True Blue, or Dark Blue Thoughts (a pessimistic 
speech that will jolt). 
3. Sky Blue, or Across the Blue (missionary special). 
4, Green Leaguers. 
5. Who’s Yellow? (Outline of big plans and challenge 
of big job.) 
6. Orange Hopes (vision of possibilities). 
7. Seeing Red (calling for the fighting spirit), or Every- 
thing’s Rosy (an optimistic speech expressing confidence 
in the outcome). 
(Note.—We have suggested two possible themes for most 
of these toasts. Select the ones that suit your purpose 
best.) 
Or these themes may be used with only four speakers on 
the program: 
1. At the End of the Rainbow. 
2. Some Rain Must Fall. 
8. Silver Linings. 
4, What’s Your Color? 
  
JAPANESE GARDEN BANQUET 
This banquet was held on a spacious lawn in the good 
old summer time. The tables were arranged in square 
formation, with a small square table in the center of the 
inclosure, at which sat the toastmaster and speaker. Near 
this table was a post, from the top of which wires were 
stretched to the four corners of the square. On these wires 
were strung Japanese lanterns. The Japanese effect can 
also be carried out in the table decorations, using Japanese 
umbrellas, dolls, ete. Tiny Japanese fans may serve as 
place cards or souvenirs. This idea is just as easily adapted 
to the indoors.
-P-A-G-E-392
PHUNOLOGY 
  FOOTBALL BANQUET 
Here is one for the football season. Tables at either end 
of the room represent the two goal lines. Tables on the 
sides may represent the side lines. Over each of the end 
tables is suspended a goal post, and suspended between 
the posts and just over the bar of one of these goals is a 
football, representing a goal kick. If given in honor of 
the town’s high-school team, the school colors would furnish 
the color scheme for your decorations. The place cards 
could be of football shape. Topics for toasts: 
“Keeping Fit.’’ 
“Hit "Em Hard.’’ 
““Teamwork.’’ 
“Over the Goal Line.’’ 
“‘Thoughts on Tackling.”’ 
THANKSGIVING BANQUET 
The tables are arranged in clover leaf style, with groups 
of three round tables each. On each table is a large cornu- 
copia, from which streamers of ribbon (or strings) go to 
each plate, white for the girls and gold for the boys. Each 
guest pulls his or her streamer and finds at its end an 
English walnut shell tied together by a bit or ribbon. 
Inside is a toast jingle to be read to the company. 
  
MILITARY BANQUET 
The decorations may include some of the war relics the 
boys brought back from France. A miniature white tent, 
with pasteboard soldiers standing guard, may grace the 
speaker’s table. Red, white, and blue, of course, will be 
the color scheme. Small American flags might be stuck in
-P-A-G-E-393
PHUNOLOGY 383 
apples and these suspended above the tables. If croquettes 
are served, stick a tiny flag in each one, or the flags may 
decorate each dish of ice cream. The following toasts might 
be given: 
“‘Make It Snappy.’’ 
“‘Camouflage.’’ 
‘‘Keep Step.”’ 
“Over the Top.”’ 
Other suggested topics are: 
“Attenshun !”’ 
‘“As You Were,”’ 
“*Rest.”’ 
“Can’t Get "Em Up.’’ 
“Maps. 
Sing some of the songs popular during the war and be 
sure to have beans somewhere in your menu. 
  
AN INDIAN BANQUET 
Here is a banquet for a fall occasion. Decorate the 
room with branches of trees, shocks of corn, ete. Red will 
be the color scheme for table decoration. On the speakers’ 
table put up a miniature tepee with a tiny camp fire 
(made by the use of a small electric globe, some red tissue 
paper, and a few sticks) and an Indian doll. Have some 
big idea you want to put across with a ‘‘whoop.’’ Give 
each girl guest a turkey or chicken feather to wear in her 
hair. Each boy should be supplied with a cloth band 
with one feather sewed upright on it. This he is to fit on 
his head and wear during the evening’s fun. Have Indian 
music, popular and classic, featured in the evening’s pro- 
gram. ‘‘Indianola’”’ and ‘‘My Pretty Rainbow’’ are types 
of the popular music desirable. ‘‘Land of the Sky-Blue 
Water’’ (Cadman) would make a good vocal solo number. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  
384 PHUNOLOGY 
“‘By the Waters of Minnetonka’’ (Lieurance) is another 
beautiful solo number. Other numbers are: ‘‘Lullaby”’ 
(Lieurance), ‘‘A Sioux Serenade,’’ and ‘‘Aooah’’ (Love 
Song). Suggested topics for toasts are as follows: 
“Camp Fire Meditations.’’ 
“‘Heap Much Pep.’’ 
“The War Cry.”’ 
““No Talk ’Em, Do ’Em.”’ 
  
AN AVIATION BANQUET 
Here is another possibility. Use plenty of toy balloons 
in decorating. Borrow several miniature aéroplanes to 
place on elevations on the tables or to suspend over them. 
Sky blue and white should be the color scheme. Suggested 
topies for toasts are: 
“<Blying in Formation.’’ 
**More Gas.’’ 
**Hitch to a Star.” 
“A Successful Flight.’’ 
“Give Her the Gun!’’ 
A BIRTHDAY BANQUET 
Have twelve tables, each decorated appropriately for 
one of the months of the year. Celebrate the birthday of 
the local Chapter in this manner. 
Still another birthday idea is to observe the annjversaries 
as they are observed for weddings, thus having a wooden 
anniversary, for instance, on the fifth birthday of the 
League, with toasts on ‘‘Wooden Heads,’’ Great Oaks,’’ 
‘*Wood You?’’ ete. These anniversaries are as follows: 
First year. Cotton. 
Second year. Paper. 
Third year. Leather. 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  
PHUNOLOGY 385 
Fifth year. Wooden. 
Seventh year. Woolen. 
Tenth year. Tin. 
Twelfth year. Linen. 
Fifteenth year. Crystal. 
Twentieth year. China. 
Twenty-fifth year. Silver. 
Thirtieth year. Pearl. 
Then there might be a Washington’s Birthday Banquet, 
or a Harvest Home Banquet, or a New Year’s Banquet, 
or a banquet for any of the holidays. A Bluebird Banquet 
is another possibility. 
MISCELLANEOUS PROGRAMS

CHAPTER XXIII 
PLAYS, CANTATAS, PAGEANTS, AND OPERETTAS 
The play of children testifies to the naturalness of the 
dramatic instinct. Playing house, store, church, conductor, 
horse, Indians, school, cireus, ete., are all of imitative and 
dramatic nature. For the Church to ignore this instinct 
would be unwise, to say the least. 
The drama was born in a religious atmosphere. ‘‘The 
Greek drama,’’ say Beegle and Crawford in ‘‘Community 
Drama and Pageantry,’’ ‘‘took its rise in village and folk 
ceremonial festivals in honor more particularly of the god 
Dionysus. ... Even down through the period of the 
great dramatists Auschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, 
drama was still a religious ceremony.’’ 
The same thing was true in England and France, where 
the drama found its beginning in the old miracle and 
mystery plays of the Church. 
It was when the drama was taken out of the Church 
and commercialized that it became a source of evil mixed 
with the good. 
The popularity and use of pageants and life plays in- 
dicate that the Church is again awakening to the value of 
the drama in presenting its truths. It also indicates a 
healthy interest in the moralizing and development of the 
dramatic instinct in its young people. The value of plays, 
pageants, and cantatas may be stated briefly as follows: 
1. They give the young people a chance to exercise the 
natural dramatic instinct under the proper direction, thus 
forfending them against its perversion. 
387
-P-A-G-E-398
    388 PHUNOLOGY 
2. Plays, pageants, and cantatas that employ large num- 
bers of young people in their production have a wonderful 
value in awakening and developing the spirit of good 
fellowship. The social value of such affairs cannot be 
overestimated. 
3. They develop teamwork. The young people get the 
spirit of pulling together in big undertakings. 
4, They draw into the circle of the Church’s influence 
young people who might not be so easily attracted in any 
other way.

That’s their style, and it just suits me, 
So I ain’t got weary yet. 
And I ain’t got weary yet, 
And I ain’t got weary yet, 
Been sittin’ in conference all day long, 
All the time I’m singin’ this song, 
And I ain’t got weary yet, 
And I never will, you bet. 
They got me up before sunrise, 
Bless my soul, couldn’t open my eyes! 
It’s a strenuous life, but you’d be surprised, 
Cause I ain’t got weary yet.

PHUNOLOGY 429 
Orrician ErwortH League ‘‘Prp’’ Sona 
(Tune, ‘‘Tipperary.’’) 
It’s a good thing to be a Leaguer, 
It’s the best thing I know; 
It’s a good thing to worship Jesus 
As heavenward we go. 
Good-by, sin and sorrow; 
Farewell, doubt and fear. 
It’s a grand, good thing to be a Leaguer, 
And that’s why we’re here. 
(Tune: ‘‘Sweet Evalina.’’) 
Here’s to old Louisville, hail to old Louisville! 
Our love to you will never, never die; 
District of all the districts the dearest, 
Our love to you will never, never die.

PEP SONGS 
Sweet Ivory Soap 
(Tune: ‘‘Sweet Adeline.’’) 
Sweet Ivory soap, you are the dope; 
You make me clean, just like scourine. 
I love you so, like Sapolio. 
You’re the idol of my bath, 
Sweet Ivory soap.

           I’d rather have fingers than toes, | 
I’d rather have eyes than a nose; 
And as for my hair, I am glad it is there, 
* I'll be sorry, you bet, when it goes. 
   For beauty I’ll not take a prize, 
There’re many more handsome by far; 
My face, I don’t mind it, for I am behind it; 
The fellow in front gets the jar. 
Wuen Do WE Ear? 
(Tune: ‘‘Gasoline.’’) 
‘When do we eat? When do we eat? 
I like my beans done nice and brown; 
I like my eggs turned upside down.

HONEST I AM ALMOST STARVED! (shouted) 
‘When do we eat? 
Sprine Wovutp Br a Dreary SEAson

PHUNOLOGY 431 
Yon Yonson 
My name is Yon Yonson, 
I come from Wisconsin, 
I work in the lumber mills there; 
I goes down the street, 
And the people I meet, 
They say, ‘‘What’s your name?’’ 
And I tells them, ‘‘My name is Yon Yonson, ete.”’ 
(This song may be repeated again and again until the 
singers are howled down. Or the singers may be agreed on 
stopping on the third round, or the fifth. In this case 
they would end with ‘‘And I tells them, ‘NONE OF YOUR 
BUSINESS.’ ’’) 
SONGS FOR JUNIORS 
BY MISS MINNIE WEBB 
(Tune: ‘‘Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.’’) 
Jesus loves the blessed Juniors, 
All the Juniors of the world— 
Red and yellow, black and white, 
They are precious in his sight, 
For he loves the blessed Juniors of the world. 
(Tane: ‘‘Long, Long Trail.’’) 
There are heathen children calling 
To you and calling to me 
From homes of heathen darkness 
Where there’s misery. 
We will heed their plaintive calling 
And make them smile once again 
By telling them of Jesus, 
Who will prove their loving Friend.
-P-A-G-E-442
  432 PHUNOLOGY 
(Tune: ‘‘Pack Up Your Troubles.’’) 
Stack up your nickels in your old tin bank 
And smile, smile, smile; 
If you’ve a heart, then do your part— 
Give, for that’s the style. 
What’s the use of keeping them? 
They won’t buy a thing anyhow; 
So stack up your nickels in your old tin bank, 
And do it now. 
(Tune: ‘‘Over There.’’) 
Over there, over there, 
Send the word, send the word over there 
That the Juniors are coming, 
Their dollars are coming— 
Hear the tink, tink, tinkling everywhere. 
So beware, say a prayer, 
Send the word and your dollars over there; 
It’s going over, we’ll put it over, 
And we’ll not give up 
Till the gospel’s everywhere. 
JUNIOR LEAGUE SONG 
(Tune: ‘Old Black Joe.’’) 
Bright are the days that the future for us holds; 
‘Love, serve, obey’’ are the watchwords of our folds, 
Keeping our pledge is the purpose of our days, 
And ‘‘All for Christ’’ the secret spring of all our praise. 
Chorus 
O Juniors, our Juniors, 
May your purpose never fail, 
For Christ to work and ne’er to shirk; 
To him all hail!
-P-A-G-E-443
  PHUNOLOGY 433 
The gold and the white are for worth and purity; 
More like the Christ we’re striving hard to be. 
Lend us your prayers, and we’ll conquer every foe; 
We will not take a backward step, but forward go. 
Faithful and true is the Junior Epworth band, 
Learning to work for a purpose great and grand, 
Learning to lead; and with leaders brave and strong, 
We'll soon recruit the Senior League, a happy throng. 
—Lallie Dorsey. 
SONGS FOR ASSEMBLIES, CITY UNIONS, STATE 
CONFERENCES, ETC. 
[Substitute the name of any other city, district, or State.] 
(Tune, ‘‘Beautiful Isle of Somewhere.’’) 
Somewhere the sun is shining, 
Somewhere the song birds dwell, 
Somewhere there’s no repining, 
Somewhere—that’s Louisville. 
Louisville, Louisville, 
District of all best and fairest, 
Deep, strong, and true, we pledge to you, 
Our love to dear old Louisville. 
Somewhere the Church is stronger, 
Somewhere the work is fun, 
Somewhere they toil the longer, 
Till every task is done. 
Somewhere the girls are fairer, 
Somewhere young men are true, 
Somewhere the vision’s clearer, 
Somewhere the shirkers few.

We hope that you feel just the same.

We are here from Louisville, 
The leading district still; 
For Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
And as we move along, 
We’ll all take up the song 
Of Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
Chorus 
On to victory, on to victory, 
On to victory we’ll go! 
We fight a winning fight, 
So help with all your might, 
Take Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
The Prince of Darkness knows 
Whence come the fiercest blows 
For Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
He knows the white and gold, 
The meaning that they hold 
In Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
For Leaguers great and small 
There comes the certain call, 
Win Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ. 
No matter where you live, 
Your prayers you’ll surely give 
For Louisville, Louisville, Louisville for Christ.

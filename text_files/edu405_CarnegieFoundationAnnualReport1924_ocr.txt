  REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT 
To the Chairman and the Trustees of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching: 
In accordance with the by-laws, I present herewith the Nineteenth Annual Report 
of the President of the Foundation, for the year ending June 30, 1924. 
In addition to the usual business of the Foundation, the year’s work included the 
further development of the Foundation’s plan of insurance and annuities, through 
the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, which is dealt with fully in later 
pages. The current results of a continuous study of pension systems will be found in 
Part VI of this report. A discussion of certain fundamental problems in education is 
continued. 
For the Division of Educational Enquiry the report includes a statement of prog- 
ress upon a pioneer study of Dental Education, together with material relating to 
the study of Legal Education. Bulletins representing both studies are now in press.

Plantz, secretary. President Falconer and President Ferry were elected to succeed 
themselves as members of the executive committee. 
The vacancy on the board created by the resignation of Chancellor McCormick 
was filled by the election of President Albert Dinwiddie of Tulane University. 
PROCEEDINGS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 
Tue executive committee met four times during the year, in November, January, 
May, and June. Full records of these meetings, the ninety-seventh to the one hun- 
dredth, inclusive, with detailed reports of the financial operations approved by the 
committee, were mailed to the trustees after each meeting. The retiring allowances 
and pensions voted by the committee during the year are given in full on the later 
pages of this report. 
The list of institutions associated with the Foundation was increased during the 
year by the addition of George Peabody College for Teachers, on November 2, 1923; 
the University of Colorado and the University of British Columbia, on May 2, 1924. 
In considering the administration of the rules for retirement, the committee re- 
peated its decision that the rules in force at any time must be administered strictly. 
Should they in any way appear ill adapted to the interests of the whole body of 
teachers, the committee will consider and recommend possible improvements. It would 
be, however, a source of general dissatisfaction to administer existing rules with other 
than the most minute fidelity to their letter and spirit. The committee decided further 
that war service with the United States Food Administration, the Council of National 
Defense, the Belgian Relief Commission, and Y. M. C. A. work with the American 
Expeditionary Force should be counted as professorial; that involuntary discontin- 
uance of teaching because of war conditions should not terminate a teacher’s expec- 
tations from the Foundation; that service with foreign governments, or as secretary 
to the governor of a state, or as city manager could not be counted as professorial, 
but did not terminate expectations from the Foundation; and that teachers who are 
primarily professional practitioners and officers holding professorial titles, but re- 
ceiving no compensation from their universities, have no expectations from the Foun- 
dation. 
The committee learned of the gratifying reception of a Report of the Commission 
on the Possibility of Readjusting the Relations of Higher Institutions of Learning 
in Manitoba, prepared in part by Dr. William S. Learned, assistant secretary of the 
Foundation, and was informed, from time to time, of the progress of a study of Dental 
Education, and of further studies in Legal Education. 
The committee granted Dr. Learned leave of absence for ten months for the prose- 
cution of studies for the Foundation in England and in continental Europe. The com- 
mittee accepted with regret the resignation of Dr. I. L. Kandel—who had given the

greater part of his time since 1914 to the pension studies of the Foundation —in order 
to become a professor in the new International Institute of Education at Teachers 
College, Columbia University. The committee approved the appointment in his place 
of Howard J. Savage, a graduate of Tufts College, a doctor of philosophy of Harvard 
University, formerly an instructor at Harvard and at Radcliffe College, a major on 
the Adjutant General’s staff during the late war, and recently associate professor of 
English at Bryn Mawr College, to give all of his time to the Foundation’s studies of 
pensions and of education. Dr. Alfred Z. Reed, who is in charge of the studies in legal 
education, Dr. Learned, and Dr. Savage were voted the formal title, Staff Member of 
the Carnegie Foundation. ©

WHAT BECOMES OF RETIRED PROFESSORS? 
Tue pension system is a new institution in American universities. Carnegie Founda- 
tion pensions began some twenty years ago. Before the institution of pensions in the 
colleges by Mr. Carnegie a few universities had provided pensions for their teachers 
under widely varying conditions, but these were in the future and little experience 
of the working of the pension system and of its relation to the life and progress of 
the scholar had been obtained by American institutions. 
The beginning of pension systems for teachers in the higher institutions was wel- 
comed both by the teachers themselves and by the public as a boon to learning and 
a just recognition of the teacher’s service. In the public mind the end had been ac- 
complished when the teacher had been happily retired and sent on his way, presum- 
ably, rejoicing. The human consequences of a system of retiring allowances for old 
age naturally received but little attention. 
This was not the attitude of mind of Mr. Carnegie himself, nor has it been that 
of those who administer his gift. He desired sincerely not only that teachers who had 
given faithful service should be able to retire without embarrassment, but also that 
they should find happiness in such retirement. Those who administer his gift have 
always kept this desire in mind, and have sought to keep in touch with the personal 
problems and desires of retired teachers. The unofficial letters, to say nothing of the 
numerous personal conferences with these teachers, constitute a most interesting 
part of the history of the first twenty years of the Foundation. 
It is too soon to draw conclusions, of a hard-and-fast sort, with respect to the re- 
sults of the pension system in American colleges. These results will be known only 
after one or two generations have had experience under a system in which retired pay 
in old age forms a part of the professor’s regular compensation. A pension system, 
like any other instrument of social machinery, can cut more than one way. Teachers 
are, first of all, human beings, and they can obtain out of such an institution true 
benefit and happiness only in proportion to those qualities of mind and of character 
which they bring to it. Furthermore, much must always depend on the circumstances 
of the particular teacher’s life — his health, his scholarly activity, his financial re- 
sources, and the nature of his obligations. 
There are few pleasanter pictures, and none that Mr. Carnegie himself enjoyed 
more, than that of the scholar relieved of routine work by his pension, yet happy and 
active. 
Such a picture is recalled by the following message: “If I live to Saturday of this 
week I shall be eighty years old and I am taking the liberty of writing a few lines 
to you and asking you when suitable opportunity arises to express to the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching my great appreciation of their admin- 
istration of Mr. Carnegie’s bounty.” This fortunate scholar, retired fifteen years ago, 
in good health and with scholarly zeal unabated, has shown a productivity in schol-

arship which younger men may well envy. Another American scholar looking out 
over the Lake of Lucerne writes: “I feel grateful to the memory of Mr. Carnegie for 
this recreation in my old age. I am engaged in the comparative study of the Greek 
of the Septuagint and that of the New Testament.” 
It was this union of happiness and usefulness in old age which Mr. Carnegie had 
in mind when he made his gift to teachers. Not every teacher finds himself so happily 
cireumstanced. Some are worn out by years of continual labor and are glad simply to 
rest. A large group find difficulty in adjusting themselves to the circumstances of a 
life in which there are no fixed requirements. Habit with the teacher is quite as hard 
a taskmaster as with the business man, and many a teacher finds it fully as difficult to 
occupy himself, in the absence of fixed duties, as the proverbial business man to whom 
retirement becomes irksome. Teachers, like business men, often lack what William 
James so fittingly described as “desultory interests” ; and when the relations of an 
active professional life are broken they find it difficult to interest themselves in new 
duties and in other men. In America, as in all countries, the great body of college 
teachers are not productive scholars. Their work has consisted mainly in teaching 
to immature minds the knowledge which they have acquired and which they have 
learned by practice to present in clear and understandable form. Perhaps there is no 
respect in which the productive scholar has a greater advantage than in his ability 
to use his leisure time of retirement effectively and happily. Any conscientious man 
can be contented under conditions of fixed duties and steady employment. It is the 
great happiness and good fortune of the scholar that he can use his leisure years in 
work that gives something to society and brings happiness to himself. 
The occupations of the retired teachers have always been matters of great interest 
to those who conduct the work of administration of the Carnegie Foundation pen- 
sions. They have sought, as best they might, to counsel with individual men and to 
suggest opportunities either for study or other employment. In the long run, how- 
ever, it goes without saying that the satisfaction which a man may have in the re- 
tired life of a teacher depends so completely on his own qualities and circumstances 
that friendly suggestion or advice can, at best, serve but a minor purpose. The best 
accumulation a man can make for his old age is the capacity to enjoy simple things 
—books, the things of the open air, and above all to be able to comprehend and enjoy 
the fellowship of the common run of men. 
GAINFUL OCCUPATIONS FOR RETIRED TEACHERS 
Awmonce the most frequent of the problems of the retired teacher brought to the atten- 
tion of the Foundation is the economic one. A teachers pension system is a new social 
device for American teachers, and indeed to Americans of all professions. It will re- 
quire some generations of experience before we, as a people, adjust ourselves to the 
problem of earning an old age annuity and of so accommodating our lives as to be
-P-A-G-E-31
  GAINFUL OCCUPATIONS FOR RETIRED TEACHERS 19 
happy and contented upon such income as can be provided for old age. Furthermore, 
the American teacher of to-day is confronted not only with the fact that the old age 
annuity has come to him as a new device, but in addition the sum of money included 
in his old age annuity does not purchase what it did ten years ago. The cost of living, 
according to the estimates of the National Industrial Conference Board, was one hun- 
dred sixty-one in May, 1924, as compared with one hundred in 1914. 
Furthermore, the teacher cannot wholly separate himself from the national spend- 
thrift habit. The American people are the most extravagant in the world. We own 
more automobiles, musical instruments, and household luxuries than any other people. 
We support sport on a scale never before attempted. Taxes—national, county, and 
city—are upon a new level and are advancing at an unforeseen rate. These are paid 
by the producers, manufacturers, and managers, both wholesale and retail, but are 
inevitably passed to the ultimate consumers, of whom the teacher is one. 
The teacher who undertakes to live on his retired pay to-day is therefore confronted 
not only with a situation under which the purchasing power of the dollar has dimin- 
ished, but also the habit of the entire people is based upon an expenditure of money 
for purposes and at a rate never before known. He must therefore not only adjust 
himself to a smaller income, if he has no outside resources, but he must do this in a 
social order in which demands both for necessities and luxuries have been greatly 
accentuated. 
The situation is illustrated in the following letter, typical of many similar en- 
quiries : “As a suitable subject for investigation by your Foundation may I venture to 
suggest Gainful Occupations open to Retired Teachers. The need for something of 
this kind has come to me with renewed force while reading your report for 1923. None 
of the systems therein described appear to propose to yield pensions large enough 
to cover living expenses. A teacher who has brought up and educated children cannot 
have saved much. The pension must be supplemented, preferably by earnings. He no 
longer is permitted to do the only thing for which he has been trained. He has grown 
out of the way of thinking he can do anything else. It would be a boon to know of 
the experience of others who have solved the problem.” 
Men who retire at ages from sixty-five to seventy, who are in good health, and 
who desire some form of gainful occupation for a more comfortable support of their 
families and themselves, have experienced considerable difficulty in finding such op- 
portunities. The problem is one with which the officials of the Foundation have con- 
cerned themselves since its beginning, and they have sought to be of service in ena- 
bling teachers to obtain opportunities for employment. 
As a recognition of this situation, the trustees of the Foundation have removed 
from their pensions practically all restrictions except that a retired teacher shall not 
continue to teach regularly in a college or university. This seems an unavoidable re- 
striction. Otherwise the Foundation would find itself spending a considerable propor- 
tion of its funds to pay teachers salaries rather than retiring allowances. As a mat-
-P-A-G-E-32
  20 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
ter of fact, a number of teachers in receipt of pensions are engaged in teaching of one 
form or another, some in preparatory schools, some as lecturers, and others in techni- 
cal schools of one sort or another, not of college grade. The Foundation has done 
its utmost to make available to retired professors every avenue of employment, and 
to do nothing to cut them off from the exercise of that profession for which they have 
been trained. 
For obvious reasons, it has not been easy for retired teachers to find opportunities 
in business, the chief reason being that a man approaching seventy is rarely desired 
for such places. Furthermore, the majority of such teachers are not ready, and gen- 
erally not able, to accept whole time employment, and business men find it difficult 
to find places in their organization for part-time men. In fact, the problem becomes 
an individual problem for each man. It is impossible to classify into groups the men 
who desire either whole time, or part time, employment after they retire from teach- 
ing. Each teacher must, in fact, settle in his own mind before he retires whether he 
is able to conduct his life successfully and happily, whether he can be contented with- 
out the regular occupation to which he has been accustomed, and whether his strength 
of body and mind and his adaptability are such that he can successfully compete with 
others in outside occupations in case there is such need. All these matters need to be 
taken into account before the teacher decides to withdraw from active teaching. 
The teachers most successful in finding employment have been those whose work 
in applied science has given them connections with business enterprises. A consider- 
able number of professors have found after their retirement remunerative work for 
a part of their time in engineering, in chemistry, or in mechanical science. This num- 
ber is partly balanced by the group who have found literary openings for remuner- 
ative work in the writing of books, of reviews, and in lecturing on subjects of inter- 
est to students and to the public. Whether the situation of the man on fixed pay, 
active or retired, will be bettered in the near future it would be idle to speculate. It 
is difficult for either individuals or governments to make changes when they have 
once reached a certain tide of expenditures. The individual generally becomes econom- 
ical only when he can no longer obtain the money to spend. He goes “broke,” in com- 
mon parlance. It is easier for the individual to come to this condition than for a gov- 
ernment; but it is none the less true that the extravagant rate of borrowing to which 
our state, county, and municipal governments now lend themselves will one day bring 
them to similar difficulties. 
It is interesting to note that notwithstanding the extravagance of the American 
people, as shown in the vast expenditures for luxuries, both by individuals and by 
their state and municipal governments, the American people, taken collectively, are 
constantly growing richer; and this is true not of the few but of the many. Millions 
of people are putting money into homes and into savings banks, and the aggregate 
of this saving is enormous. In this respect teachers are in no way different from other 
human beings. Some professors find it difficult to support their families in comfort,
-P-A-G-E-33
  ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT TO LIFE ON RETIRED PAY Q1 
to buy books, and to satisfy the cultural desires of their lives. Others are able to do 
all these things and to put aside money for a rainy day. 
THE ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT TO LIFE ON RETIRED PAY 
Tue deliberate adjustment of individual and family life to the diminished income of 
old age is characteristic of old and long settled communities and nations. In Great 
Britain, in France, in Germany, and in most European countries, a large proportion 
of what we call the middle class live on moderate salaries, and plan their lives, upon 
the assumption of an old age income adjusted to the scale of their income-earning 
days. The purchase of old age annuities, the putting aside of part of the income re- 
ceived during the active period of life for old age, and the conscious adjustment to 
the economic situation which this implies are all characteristic of communities whose 
economic and social life has been long established. We, in the United States, are still 
young in these respects. We stand near to the pioneer days when life was an adven- 
ture to its end, and it is only within the last quarter century that population has be- 
come so great and the pressure of life so general, that groups of the population have 
been forced to consider the economic adjustment of old age as a part of the order of 
life. To-day many members of the body politic, teachers, government employees, and 
large groups of wage-earners, are beginning to take into consideration during their 
active years the economic adjustment which must be made if life is to be comfort- 
able as old age diminishes income-earning power. 
With teachers, whether in the public schools or in the colleges and universities, 
this question is becoming a part of the problem of American life. We are approach- 
ing in economic conditions the European situation. Old age annuity systems are 
being set up in many cities and states for the benefit of teachers and other public offi- 
cers, and colleges and universities in the United States very generally recognize the 
obligation for some provision by which both the teacher and his institution may have 
the security of an old age retirement plan. It will require a generation, no doubt, for 
American teachers so to adjust themselves to the situation where the economic tran- 
sition from active pay to retired pay may be made without some degree of stress. 
It is worth while to call attention to the fact that the teachers who secure contracts 
in the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association have a great advantage in making 
this adjustment. They can be carried out over a long term of years, and can be so ar- 
ranged as to disturb but little the economic life of the teacher during his active career, 
and to add greatly to his peace of mind when he retires from active service. The 
machinery set up in the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association was adopted 
after many years of study and in the light of the experience of the pension systems 
of European countries and with the advice of the best experts. It not only gives the 
teacher a contract which he can maintain whether he remains in college work or leaves 
it, but also offers him the opportunity to adjust his active pay to his retiring income
-P-A-G-E-34
    22 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
in such a way as to cause the least difficulty. This can perhaps be best appreciated by 
an illustration taken from the records of what is now happening with the policy- 
holders of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. The following illustra- 
tion is typical of what the American teacher in a good college may expect, and of 
the way in which he can adjust his active income to his retiring income: 
A starts at twenty-seven as an instructor at a salary of $1800; becomes assistant 
professor at thirty-two at $2400; an associate professor at thirty-six at $3000; a full 
professor at forty at $4000; at fifty he is receiving $5000 a year, and between sixty 
and sixty-five is in receipt of a salary of $5500. 
This schedule of pay is neither that of the strongest university nor yet of the 
small colleges, but is fairly typical of the financial experience of a professor in a rep- 
resentative American institution. If the teacher takes out a contract at twenty-seven 
with the codperation of his college, each paying five per cent of his salary in monthly 
premiums, his financial exhibit up to the age of sixty-five will be shown in the fol- 
lowing table. It is understood that his contract is based upon a four per cent rate, 
which is the highest the law permits to be guaranteed in an annuity contract. This 
rate is guaranteed in the contract, and under its charter the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association may not promise to the policy-holder additional profits out of 
any surplus it may earn, but when a surplus is earned in a given year such partici- 
pation in profits may be allowed the policy-holders as the trustees find possible. 
Out of such profits the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has hitherto 
allotted each year an additional one-half of one per cent to the holders of annuity 
contracts. There is shown, therefore, in the table which follows, the accumulation to 
the credit of the teacher, first, on the basis of four per cent, and then on the basis 
of four and one-half per cent. 
ANNUITY ACCUMULATIONS Monthly annuity Attained Age beginning at 
32 36 40 50 60 65 65 
At 4% $996 $2,206 $3,882 $10,652 $21,899 $29,687 $279.85 
At 43% 1,009 2,254 4,003 11,249 23,763 32,695 308.21 
This table shows only the bare financial sketch. It leaves out of view both the 
appeal to personal thrift and the opportunity of the teacher to adjust his retired 
income to his active income, not as a sudden process but by a gradual and deliber- 
ate proceeding over a term of years. 
The short experience which the Association has had has been sufficient to show 
that one of the great advantages of the contractual system lies in the appeal it makes 
to the sense of responsibility of the head of a family. As his statements of account 
come in year after year, he cannot fail to be impressed with the rate at which these 
accumulations grow. One of the first reactions to his impressions is shown by the 
attitude of many men in paying in extra sums over and above their contract premiums 
into the annuity accumulations. A teacher makes an extra hundred dollars. He pays
-P-A-G-E-35
ECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT TO LIFE ON RETIRED PAY 23 
half of it into his annuity fund. A few hundred dollars additional placed in the ac- 
count during the earlier years of one’s service as a teacher, and before the obliga- 
tions of a family become so pressing, will make a notable difference in income at sixty- 
five, sixty-seven, or seventy. How quick this response has been can be appreciated 
from the fact that there has been paid in during the last three years into the Teachers 
Insurance and Annuity Association $645,000 over and above the regular monthly 
premiums. The policy-holders who have paid in this sum have found themselves in 
no great measure limited by the payments, and have laid up for themselves in their 
old age an accumulation of the greatest value. 
But one of the chief advantages of the contractual system to the teacher lies in 
the fact that as he comes within fifteen or twenty years of the time of retirement he 
has presented before him every year a picture of what his retired pay will be, and 
he can with very moderate payments from his salary so adjust the ratio of active to 
retired pay as to make no decided break in his economic situation. The determina- 
tion of the kind of life he will lead after retirement is thus far more completely in 
his own hands and depends in the main upon his own circumstances, his own desires, 
and his own self-control. But there is presented before him, as there is not presented 
in the haphazard economic situation of our day, exactly what the circumstances of 
his retired pay will be, and the means by which the transition from active to retired 
salary can be compassed with least inconvenience. 
One may well hope that the time will never come in America when university pro- 
fessors will do their work in the attitude of mind of a routine clerk with one eye on 
his pay and the other on his pension. Civil pensions for government employees in 
some of the European countries have resulted in distinct injury to the state that paid 
the pensions and to the men who received them. The ideal of service becomes sub- 
ordinate to the very natural but more selfish desire to have security and ease in old 
age. There is no social machinery which can be set up among men that does not 
carry with it the possibilities of harm as well as of good. The lack of any such ma- 
chinery for college teachers and for public school teachers has been the source of 
much anxiety and a great hardship in individual cases. The institution of an agency 
like the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association makes it possible for any col- 
lege teacher to safeguard his future intelligently and with the least sacrifice. Par- 
ticularly is this true in those institutions that, recognizing their responsibility for 
a system of honorable retirement, coéperate with their teachers. That this arrange- 
ment will grow into a deadening official régime tempting men into selfish and me- 
diocre service, no one believes. A university or a college may rely upon the develop- 
ment of a spirit of scholarly devotion and aspiration strong enough to overcome such 
tendencies. It surely will not be necessary to preserve the hand-to-mouth method of 
dealing with college teachers which has existed in the past in order to ensure their 
zeal and ambition. Such has not been the effect upon the teachers of the European 
universities.

24 IS THE OLD AGE PENSION 
IS THE OLD AGE PENSION AN ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE OF 
AMERICAN EDUCATION? 
Sryce its beginning, the reports of the Carnegie Foundation have contained, year by 
year, a careful review of pension systems throughout the world, and particularly of 
all such systems having to do with teachers. This collection of material is now inval- 
uable, and there will be found in it an account of every form of pension system which 
has been undertaken in the last twenty years, together with a clear statement of the 
experience of the world with these various systems and the essential principles which 
that experience has confirmed. 
It is fair to say that the old age pension has been accepted in all the more ad- 
vanced European nations for all callings demanding special preparation of a high 
order, but which, nevertheless, offer moderate salaries. The security of the old age 
pension is considered as a counter-attraction to the opportunity for money-making 
in other callings, and as a means also of holding in government service, in mili- 
tary service, in the service of teaching, large groups of men who are willing to ac- 
cept moderate life compensation when coupled with a reasonable protection in   old age. 
In os United States, the whole question of the establishment of a reasonable sys- 
tem of old age pensions for government employees, for teachers, and for other pro- 
fessional groups necessarily employed on moderate pay has been complicated by the 
political history of our war pensions. 
The first legislation by Congress upon pensions was passed in 1776. It promised in- 
valid pensions to officers and men of the army and navy who lost a limb or who were 
otherwise disabled in the War of Independence. From that date to the passage of the 
much discussed bonus bill, in May, 1924, over the veto of President Coolidge, the grant- 
ing of pensions by the Government of the United States to the veterans of its various 
wars has been unhappily complicated by politics. The country has always recognized 
its obligation to maintain pensions for those who were disabled, but through polit- 
ical pressure an enormous number of such pensions have been granted to those whose 
services in the various wars had resulted in no injury. The pension schedule which has 
hung over the country since the days of the Civil War has been perhaps the most 
' flagrant instance of political intrigue which the country has known, and has exhibited 
at its worst the weaknesses both of Congress and of the Presidents. 
Presidents Cleveland, Harding, and Coolidge have deserved of the country the 
highest credit for their courage in dealing with this troublesome problem. This ex- 
perience of the nation of the abuse of the pension privilege through the weakness of 
political manipulation has gone far to make the pension problem for teachers diffi- 
cult, particularly in the tax-supported institutions. States have hesitated to embark 
upon participation in a pension system with the lesson of the United States military 
pensions before their eyes. This attitude is slowly disappearing, and it seems fair to
-P-A-G-E-37
AN ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE OF AMERICAN EDUCATION? = 25 
say that the essential principles which must be observed, if any pension system is to 
be financially sound and satisfactory to its participants, are being better under- 
stood. This is instanced by the fact that the day of hasty and ill-considered enact- 
ment of pension laws is passing. A body of public opinion is forming sufficiently 
enlightened, first, to recognize the value of a sound retiring system in the public 
schools and, second, to proceed with care when opportunity offers for securing new, 
or for revising old, legislation. The action of the National Education Association 
in setting forth and commending fundamentally sound principles for the establish- 
ment of pensions in the public schools is particularly helpful. Toward this whole 
program of sound pensions, as a part of the teacher’s compensation, the Carnegie 
Foundation has sought to contribute in two ways: first, by setting up in the Teach- 
ers Insurance and Annuity Association machinery by which the college teacher may 
safeguard his family against the hazard of premature death, and may safeguard 
himself against dependence under conditions that are sound and within his financial 
reach, and secondly, by setting forth in the light of experience of other countries 
the principles which must be observed if a pension system is to be permanent, satis- 
factory, and within the reach of teachers. 
It is perhaps not too much to say that these two contributions: first, constructive 
action in setting up a sound pension system, and second, the making available infor- 
mation as to the success and the failure of the various pension systems for teachers 
throughout the world, have proved a large factor in the gradual development of 
teachers pension systems in the United States. There still remains the disposition 
to be over-sanguine as to what a given sum of money contributed year by year may 
do in maintaining pensions. An instance of this is found in the recommendations 
of the Pension Committee of the National Education Association to the effect that 
“ adequate retirement allowances should be provided for every permanently disabled 
teacher regardless of the amount of her account at the time of such disability.” Such 
a statement is dangerous and unsound. No pension system can be made to cover every 
exigency of life, nor can any system remain permanently sound which undertakes 
benefits for whose payment no provision has been made. 
It cannot be too often stated that in the long run the members of a pension sys- 
tem will become dissatisfied with the results of any plan which does not leave each 
individual to stand upon his own personal ground. For example: although the Eng- 
lish Civil Service pensions were originally paid entirely by the government, they 
finally came to be recognized as deferred pay, but the benefit of long service was con- 
fined to survivors and no advantages accrued to representatives of those who died in 
service. 
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has been commented on as fol- 
lows by the New York State Insurance Department : 
“This Association operates under most favorable conditions ; in fact, no other or- 
ganization doing an insurance business can be compared with it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  26 IS THE OLD AGE PENSION 
“The Association appears to have exceedingly efficient management at a very low 
cost, particularly as to salaries of officers.” 
The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association has, furthermore, this unique 
feature, that four of its sixteen trustees are elected by the votes of the teachers who 
are policy-holders. It would be difficult to bring together sixteen men better quali- 
fied by training and by experience to conduct the affairs of an insurance company 
than those who compose the Board of Trustees of the Teachers Insurance and An- 
nuity Association. The policy-holders are particularly indebted to the Finance Com- 
mittee, composed of upright and busy men who give their time month by month to 
the problems of investment of the funds of the Association and to the continual scru- 
tiny of the securities which the Association holds, either as capital, as surplus, or as 
reserves. Financial security in the changing conditions of to-day lies not only in the 
careful purchase of sound securities, but in the continual watching of the securities 
purchased in the past. 
On June 30, 1924, the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association had in force 
2508 insurance policies covering $13,255,721 insurance. There were also 2459 annuity 
contracts which will provide eventually $3,518,175 of annual payments. The total 
number of policy-holders at the same date was 3749. These policy-holders are drawn 
from 444 institutions, of which 122 are codperating with their teachers in the old 
age annuity plan. The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association is now the sec- 
ond largest company in the United States in the writing of annuities. At the time 
the Association was established, seventy-four colleges and universities of the United 
States were associated with the Foundation and their teachers had the privileges of 
the retiring allowance granted through the Foundation. Of these seventy-four, two 
colleges, Franklin College, in Indiana, and Centre College, in Danville, Kentucky, 
withdrew from the associated institutions to accept denominational government. Of 
the remaining seventy-two, forty-seven have established coéperative retiring allow- 
ances with their teachers. Of these, two universities, Harvard and the University of 
California, have set up their own retiring allowances. The University of Wisconsin has 
entered the state pension system for public school teachers established by the State 
of Wisconsin. The system of the University of California is still being adjusted in 
some of its details. Harvard administers its own retiring fund, which is formed by 
a ten per cent assessment on the salary of all teachers who desire to enter it and is 
obligatory on all teachers after one year of service. Concerning this system, which was 
inaugurated in 1920, an officer of the University writes: 
“In regard to our system of retiring allowances, I find that on June 30, 1924, 
our Professors Retiring Allowance Fund amounted to $48,337.37, and that we 
had ninety-two participants in the same. This fund is not invested separately 
but is kept by the Treasurer with his General University Investments, and 
receives the current rate of interest that is paid by the Treasurer on General 
Investments.
-P-A-G-E-39
AN ACCEPTED PRINCIPLE OF AMERICAN EDUCATION? Q7 
“So far, no one has retired on a pension. I do not hear much comment on 
the arrangement, and should say that it is working satisfactorily. In certain cases 
we have found that instructors and professors have arranged for some indepen- 
dent form of insurance, in which case, President Lowell has agreed to having 
the premium on such insurance paid out of the ten per cent which is withheld 
by the University.” 
The remaining forty-four institutions that have adopted retiring allowances have 
made use of the policies of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, There are 
twenty-five of the institutions which were associated with the Foundation in 1918, 
when the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association was established, which have 
as yet made no permanent arrangement for a retirement allowance system. This list 
includes some institutions which have deferred consideration of the pension plan pend- 
ing a solution of other financial problems. It includes, however, other well-known insti- 
tutions, like Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Washington University, and the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, as well as colleges, like Dartmouth and Amherst, and a num- 
ber of tax-supported universities, like the University of Virginia, the University of 
Missouri, Purdue, and the University of Indiana. The delay in setting up a sound 
pension system has been due to various causes, but probably in the main to the fact 
that other problems have seemed more pressing. These institutions do not feel the same 
pressure as the college which has no pension system for its older teachers. The pension 
problem with them will not become acute for some years. At the same time it is to be 
remembered that these institutions have the greatest possible advantage in undertak- 
ing permanent allowance systems while their old teachers are being cared for over a 
term of years by the Carnegie Foundation. With these institutions the beginning of a 
sound contractual and contributory pension system is a very simple matter, since it 
begins with the codperation of the younger men, involving a moderate sum of money, 
and will grow to its normal load only at the end of twenty or thirty years. Younger 
teachers, however, look upon the old age pensions as something very far in the future 
and do not realize the great advantage of undertaking a contract at a relatively early 
age. Older professors in these institutions have not felt particularly moved to agitate 
the question since they are provided for. It has, therefore, been a somewhat singular 
fact that the interest in the establishment of a permanent system of retiring allow- 
ances has made less appeal to many of the institutions associated with the Foundation 
than to those who had to undertake the problem ab initio. 
It is an interesting fact, also, that the institutions which had to shoulder their 
problem in this form have rarely failed to make some provision for their older 
teachers. 
Tax-supported institutions have naturally found more difficulty in getting codper- 
ation with their institutions through state appropriations. Having in mind the ex- 
perience of the general government, the state governments have been shy of appro- 
priating funds for pensions in any form, but as time has gone on the state legislatures
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
in a number of states have lent themselves to the establishment of pension systems 
for teachers in which the states codperate. It is interesting to note that the Univer- 
sities of Utah, of South Carolina, of Arkansas, and of Alabama have been able to 
obtain appropriations from their respective states enabling their universities to co- 
operate with teachers in the matter of old age annuities, while strong universities, 
like those of Virginia, Minnesota, and Indiana, have not yet established such rela- 
tionships. 
ADDITION OF COLLEGES TO THE ASSOCIATED LIST 
Srvc its inauguration the Carnegie Foundation has offered to certain institutions, 
selected on the ground of the scholarly character of their work, the opportunity to 
become members of the group of institutions associated with the Foundation. As 
long as the original full paid pensions were granted by the Foundation this relation- 
ship carried with it the granting of such retiring allowances to the teachers of these 
institutions. With the discontinuance of this form of pension system for teachers 
entering associated institutions after 1915 the Foundation did not cease to offer to 
newly associated institutions certain large advantages. These consist of certain assist- 
ance from its Reserve Fund Number Two, which on June 30,1924,contained bonds of 
$768,000 par value. This provides, first, assistance to institutions in setting up a sound 
retiring allowance scheme, second, an interest rate of at least four and one-half per 
cent in accumulating their annuities, and third, a disability benefit to teachers whose 
disability shall incapacitate them from service, after carrying for five years an an- 
nuity contract. In this class the Foundation takes over the contract of the teacher at 
the time of his disability and pays him for the remainder of his life an annuity equal 
to two-thirds of that which he would have received, had he continued to age sixty- 
five contributions equal to the average of the five years immediately preceding his 
disability. 
This last benefit is of great significance, and it applies to teachers in all associated 
colleges and universities who contribute toward annuity contracts. For the payment 
of this disability an emergency reserve is being accumulated by the Foundation which, 
on June 30, 1924, amounted to $475,000 par value. 
The first case to arise under this rule was presented in May of the present year. 
A teacher had taken out on March 1, 1919, an annuity contract whose premium in- 
creased from $15 to $25 a month, averaging $19.16, and which at age sixty-five would 
have provided a retiring allowance of $1148 a year, and under the rule the disability 
allowance which he receives from the Foundation amounts to $770. 
_ During the past year there have been admitted to the associated list of the Foun- 
dation three institutions, each of which represents an interesting factor in American 
education, using that term to include colleges of the United States and of the Do- 
minion of Canada. The institutions are: George Peabody College for Teachers, Nash-
-P-A-G-E-41

ville, Tennessee; the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado; and the University 
of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia. 
In the case of George Peabody College for Teachers the Carnegie Foundation con- 
tributed from its Reserve Fund Number Two $25,000 par value of securities on con- 
dition that the college authorities should first raise $50,000 par value of securities for 
the same purpose, the entire sum to go into a fund whose income shall be used for co- 
operating with the teachers of thecolleges in an acceptable form of old age annuities. 
The University of Colorado and the University of British Columbia are tax-sup- 
ported institutions. With them, as with most tax-supported institutions, the question 
of greatest difficulty is the retirement of men already long in service. Both state and 
provincial governments have been generally hospitable toward the proposal to provide 
from state revenues the regular five per cent payment of the salary of the teacher as 
a form of codperating with him in providing the old age annuity. The question of 
providing anything further than this has been a difficult matter in most tax-sup- 
ported institutions. 
The University of Colorado has solved this question as far as it could be done in 
the following manner: Teachers at all ages take out annuity contracts. For the older 
men these contracts will furnish meagre retiring allowances even though they con- 
tinue in service to the age of sixty-eight or seventy. The regents of the University 
of Colorado have been able to secure a grant of $10,000 a year for a period of ten 
years to: be used in supplementing the annuities of older teachers. In admitting the 
University of Colorado to the associated list the Carnegie Foundation agreed to 
make an additional payment from its Reserve Fund Number Two, of $5000 annually 
for a period of twenty years toward the same purpose. 
This solution of a difficult problem is well worth the attention of institutions that 
hitherto have not succeeded in coming to some sound conclusion. The sum of money 
thus provided will not furnish as generous retiring allowances as the younger teachers 
will obtain in the long run through their annuity contracts, but on the other hand, 
by enabling a professor who hitherto has had no expectation of a retiring allowance 
to enter upon this period of his life with a guaranteed modest income of $1500 or 
$2000 a year, it goes far toward tiding over the transition period between the situ- 
ation where no pensions were available and those which will accrue to younger men 
after the pension system has been established for a considerable term of years. 
In the University of British Columbia the same situation was present, with the 
very great difference that in this university the faculty was young and the retiring 
allowance which will be available through the regular annuity contracts will approach 
the normal level of such allowances. To enable the university to deal with the matter 
satisfactorily for the small group of men whose retiring allowances would be below 
this level, the Foundation voted a grant of $5000 annually for ten years from Reserve 
Fund Number Two to the University of British Columbia to form a fund to be used 
with its accumulation toward the annuities of the older teachers.

  30 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
The case of these two universities, both tax supported, the one in the United States 
and the other in Canada, illustrates how a difficult problem can be solved with pa- 
tience and with the disposition on the part of state authorities, of the university gov- 
erning body, and of the teachers themselves to work out a solution that may be fairly 
satisfactory to older teachers as well as to younger. 
GEORGE PEABODY COLLEGE FOR TEACHERS 
George Peabody College for Teachers at Nashville, Tennessee, owes its existence 
to the wise generosity of the great educational philanthropist whose name it bears. 
In 1867, George Peabody, who had founded the Peabody Institutes at Danvers, now 
Peabody, Salem, Massachusetts, and Baltimore, and who gave substantial sums to 
Harvard, Kenyon, and Yale, set up a fund of more than $3,000,000, under condi- 
tions that allowed to its trustees the most liberal discretion in its use, which was 
intended primarily for the development of education in the South. One of its bene- 
factions was the Peabody Normal College, founded at Nashville. In 1875, the insti- 
tution opened its doors to thirteen pupils. On account of the success of this philan- 
thropic venture and its stimulating effect upon the training of teachers in the Southern 
states, the trustees of the fund, urged by the president, faculty, and alumni of the 
normal college and the citizens of Nashville, decided in 1903 to found an institution 
for the higher professional education of teachers, a decision which led to the estab- 
lishment of the institution which now exists. 
From the Peabody Education Fund, the college has received $1,500,000, in one 
original and two subsequent gifts; from the University of Nashville, land and build- 
ings valued at about $200,000; from the state, county, and city, grants to the amount 
of $550,000; and from private benefactors, some $2,605,000, of which $55,000 have 
come from alumni, who, it is estimated, will ultimately contribute an amount in 
excess of $167,000. Realizing that the college was one of the most important edu- 
cational forces of the South, the Carnegie Corporation of New York has given it 
$180,000 for library purposes. The college having availed itself of the contracts 
offered to its instructors by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of 
America, the Carnegie Foundation granted $25,000 to assist in the accumulation of 
a sum of money to be used for the retiring allowances of the older teachers. That 
citizens of the Southern states appreciate the work of George Peabody College is evi- 
dent from the fact that in 1923, aside from grants from the Peabody Education 
Fund, approximately forty-four per cent of the assets of the college had been received 
from Southern sources. 
The proximity of Vanderbilt University has led the two institutions to develop 
a plan of codperation in instruction, which enables each, while remaining indepen- 
dent in organization and administration, to utilize fully the resources of the other. 
George Peabody College for Teachers admits upon examination or certificate on a 
basis of fifteen units, but only without conditions, candidates for the degree of Bach-
-P-A-G-E-43
  ADDITION OF COLLEGES TO THE ASSOCIATED LIST 81 
elor of Science, for which a total of 198 hours is required. The degree of Master of 
Science is awarded to holders of a bachelor’s degree upon the satisfactory comple- 
tion of forty-one hours of graduate work, of which six must be in seminars, and an 
approved thesis. The doctorate in philosophy is also conferred in course. Courses of 
instruction are particularly well developed as regards Agriculture, Economics, and 
Education, including Early Elementary Education, Education of the Blind, Educa- 
tional Psychology, Intermediate and Upper Grade Education, Religious Education, 
Rural Education, School Administration, and Secondary Education, English, Health, 
and Industrial Arts. Recently the facilities for training teachers and supervisors for 
service in vocational education under the Smith-Hughes Law have been materially 
increased. The Demonstration School offers excellent opportunities for pedagogical 
observation and for some practice teaching. 
The work of George Peabody College lies essentially in the preparation of teach- 
ers. To that end, the four-quarters system has been adopted, and every effort is made, 
even through correspondence, to afford teachers facilities for instruction which permit 
them to combine practical work in their schools with academic study and further 
training. 
George Peabody College for Teachers is the third institution located at Nashville 
to be admitted to association with the Carnegie Foundation. Vanderbilt University 
became so associated in 1919, and Fisk University in 1921. All of these institutions 
have adopted the retirement plan of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. 
UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO 
Although the University of Colorado was incorporated in 1861 by act of the First 
Territorial Legislature and its location was fixed at Boulder, it was not until 1877 
that the institution was opened. Meanwhile, however, a site had been provided at 
Boulder by three public-spirited citizens, who, in 1872, had given to the university 
fifty-two acres of land adjoining the city. An appropriation of $15,000 from the Ter- 
ritorial Legislature in 1874, together with a like sum raised by the trustees during 
the following year, rendered possible the erection of the first building. The consti- 
tution of Colorado, adopted in 1876, made the “University at Boulder” a state in- 
stitution, thus entitling it to lands appropriated to its use by Congress, and provid- 
ing for its management and control. The university is supported by the proceeds of a 
fractional mill tax and by special appropriations from the Legislature. 
When the university was opened in 1877, it consisted of two departments, the 
preparatory and the normal. The end of the first thirty years, a period of solid 
growth and seasoned expansion, found neither of these original departments in exist- 
ence. The University of Colorado to-day comprises the following schools and col- 
leges, which were opened in the years indicated: the College of Arts and Sciences, 
1878; the School of Medicine, 1883; the Graduate School, 1892; the School of Law, 
1892; the College of Engineering, 1893; the Summer Session, increased in 1919 to  
-P-A-G-E-44
  82 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
a full quarter; the College of Commerce, 1906, which became the School of Business 
Administration in 1924; the College of Pharmacy, 1911; the University Extension 
Division, 1912. The College of Arts and Sciences includes the College of Education, 
1908, and the Department of Home Economics, 1920, which had been opened in 
1912 as the School of Social and Home Service. According to the State Constitution, 
the Board of Regents, which consists of six members, has general supervision and 
“the exclusive control, and direction of all funds of, and appropriations to, the Uni- 
versity.” 
The State of Colorado has dealt generously with its university. Of the twenty- 
three buildings which constitute the physical plant of the institution, twenty were 
provided by the State; the remaining three, the Mackay Auditorium, the Henry S. 
Denison Memorial Building, and the Simon Guggenheim Law Building, were erected 
by private benefaction. The development of the College of Engineering and the 
School of Medicine has been especially noteworthy. In 1920, the project of uniting 
all the training in Medicine in one institution, located in Denver, was undertaken. 
For this project, $600,000 was appropriated by the Legislature; $350,000 was ap- 
propriated by direct vote of the people for a Psychopathic hospital ; $700,000, later 
increased to $880,000, by the General Education Board; $50,000 a year toward 
maintenance for three years beginning with 1924, by the General Education Board; 
$100,000 by the Carnegie Corporation; and $305,000 by private subscriptions and 
gifts in Colorado. The new school will open its doors on September 25, 1924. 
The Regents adopted the contributory plan of retiring annuities, to be adminis- 
tered in codperation with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, on Feb- 
ruary 15, 1924. On May 2, the Carnegie Foundation added the University of Colo- 
rado to the list of associated institutions, and voted to grant a substantial sum to 
assist in the purchase of retiring annuities for the older teachers. 
The University, even with its strength and usefulness in professional training, 
stands for the study of the arts and for that cultural education which forms the 
groundwork of preparation for the professions. Although essentially a state-sup- 
ported institution, it serves the needs of neighboring states, and it attracts resident 
students from the north, south, and east, as well as from the west. 
UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA 
The University of British Columbia, the first of the four universities of the western 
provinces of Canada to be associated with the Foundation, was admitted to the priv- 
ileges of association on May 2, 1924. The associated institutions in the Dominion 
now are five in number: The University of British Columbia, at Vancouver; Dal- 
housie University, at Halifax; Queen’s University, at Kingston, Ontario; McGill 
University, at Montreal; and the University of Toronto. 
The University of British Columbia is the youngest of the Canadian universities. 
An Act of the Provincial Legislature, passed in 1890, established an institution of
-P-A-G-E-45
ADDITION OF COLLEGES TO THE ASSOCIATED LIST 33 
that name, but the enactment lapsed in 1891, through lack of a quorum at the first 
meeting of the University Senate. Efforts to bring university education within the 
reach of the youth of the province continued, with the result that certain high 
schools became affiliated with recognized Canadian universities, and later such high 
schools attained the status of colleges of the universities of which they were part. 
Among these were the Vancouver High School, which affiliated with McGill Uni- 
versity as Vancouver College, and the Victoria High School, which became connected 
with McGill as Victoria College. As the institution grew and courses extended, still 
closer connection with McGill became necessary. In 1906, an Act was passed incor- 
porating the Royal Institution for the Advancementof Learning of British Columbia, 
which in the same year established at Vancouver the McGill University College of 
British Columbia. One year later, Victoria College also came under the control of the 
Royal Institution as a part of the McGill University College of British Columbia, 
with power to give courses covering the first two years in Arts. The institution was 
similar to that of McGill University, the standards were identical, and the Univer- 
sity examined and accepted the undergraduates on the same status. The two McGill 
University Colleges, at Vancouver and at Victoria, were maintained principally by 
grants of the respective school boards, supplemented in the earlier stages by con- 
tributions from private citizens, and later by grants from the Provincial Govern- 
ment, the city of Vancouver, and the University of British Columbia. Of the two, 
attendance at the McGill University College at Vancouver increased the more rapidly, 
until in 1915, there were 292 students as compared with 70 at Victoria. 
Meanwhile, efforts had been renewed for the establishment of a Provincial Uni- 
versity. In 1908, there was passed an Act establishing and incorporating the Univer- 
sity of British Columbia and repealing the old Act of 1891. The new Act, slightly 
amended in 1911 and 1913, set apart 2,000,000 acres of land by way of university 
endowment. In 1920, the sections dealing with land endowment under the University 
Endowment Act were repealed, and all lands in the province which had been set 
aside for higher education reverted to the Provincial Government. In the same year 
approximately 3000 acres of land owned by the Crown in the right of the province 
situate at Point Grey were set aside by enactment and are to be developed as town- 
site property. The net proceeds derived from the sale of lots or lands in this area 
are to be paid into the “University Endowment Account.” In 1915, when the Uni- 
versity was opened, all connection with the parent university ceased, and provision 
was made for a complete course of four years in Arts and three years in Applied 
Science. From this time forward the progress of the university has been steady, and 
when the fact is considered that much of its important early development took place 
during the war and the years immediately thereafter, it can only be described as 
phenomenal. 
The University is an integral part of the public educational system of British 
Columbia. As such, it completes the work begun in the public and high schools,

fosters the general educational interests of the Province, and serves its constituency 
through the three media of teaching, research, and extension. By prescribing a 
number of studies during the earlier years of undergraduate work, and by providing 
during the later years a wide choice under a well-defined system of options, the Uni- 
versity is enabled to direct its students without discouraging individual initiative. 
It has set for itself high scholastic standards, and its usefulness extends no less to its 
more remote friends and constituents than to its resident students. 
Although the four western provincial universities of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, 
Alberta, and British Columbia, and especially the three named last, are held to bear 
a close resemblance to the state universities of the United States, the constitution 
of the University of British Columbia may seem, to American eyes, somewhat dif- 
ferent. The University consists of a Chancellor, a Convocation, a Board of Governors, 
a Senate, and the Faculties. The first Convocation, held August 21, 1912, included 
849 members: all graduates of any university in the King’s Dominions resident in 
the Province two years before the date of the first meeting, together with twenty- 
five members selected by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Since the first meet- 
ing, the Convocation has consisted of the Chancellor, the President, members of the 
first Convocation, and all graduates of the University. The Convocation elects the 
Chancellor. The Board of Governors, except the Chancellor and the President, is ap- 
pointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. The membership of the Senate in- 
cludes the Minister of Education, the Chancellor, the Deans, and two professors from 
each Faculty, elected by its members, fifteen members elected by the Convocation 
from among its members, various educational officials of the Province, and the Presi- 
dent of the University, who presides at meetings. 
Before long the University will be moved to its new site at the extremity of Point 
Grey, a headland overlooking the Gulf of Georgia at an elevation of approximately 
300 feet. Here a site of ample dimensions has been set apart for the development of 
the institution, and three buildings of a permanent nature and six of semi-perma- 
nent construction, to the value of approximately $3,000,000, are approaching com- 
pletion. The design and plans for expansion have been drawn with a view both to the 
future physical needs of the University and to the natural beauty of the site. 
The University adopted the contributory plan of retiring allowances, Teachers In- 
surance and Annuity Association of America, on March 18, 1924, as of April 1st, 
in spite of the fact that members of the Faculties are eligible for participation in the 
Provincial employees retirement scheme. 
With the University of British Columbia are now affiliated Victoria College of 
Victoria, 1920, for the first two years in Arts; Westminster Hall (Presbyterian), 
Vancouver, 1922, theological; the Anglican Theological College of British Columbia, 
Vancouver, 1922; and Ryerson College (Methodist), Vancouver, 1924, theological.

IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OLD AGE ANNUITIES 
Tue last report of the President of the Foundation printed a list of eighty-four uni- 
versities and colleges that had adopted the contractual system of retiring allowances 
which is administered by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. During 
the year ending June 30, 1924, this number of institutions was increased to ninety- 
five by the addition of eleven universities and colleges, namely : the American Acad- 
emy at Rome, Beloit College, University of British Columbia, Colgate University, 
University of Colorado, Constantinople Woman’s College, Hampton Institute, Po- 
mona College, Trinity College (North Carolina), Vassar College, and Western Reserve 
University. 
The plan has also been adopted by twelve other institutions that are primarily de- 
voted to education or research, namely: the Academy of Political Science, the Froe- 
bel League, the Phelps-Stokes Fund, four of Mr. Rockefeller’s large endowments, — 
the General Education Board, the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, the Rocke- 
feller Foundation, and the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research; and five foun- 
dations established by Mr. Carnegie, —the Carnegie Corporation, the Carnegie En- 
dowment for International Peace, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching, the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association. 
From the beginning also the Association had admitted to its privileges certain 
private schools. There are now fifteen of these contributing toward annuities for their 
teachers,namely: Adelphi Academy, the Brearley, Brooklyn Polytechnic Preparatory, 
Chandor, Chapin, Groton, Horace Mann, Hotchkiss, and Kamehameha Schools, Loomis 
Institute, the Middlesex and Nichols Schools, Porter Military Academy, Scarborough 
School, and Williston Seminary. 
In all, therefore, one hundred and twenty-two universities, colleges, and similar 
institutions are contributing, through the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Associ- 
ation, toward annuities for their officers and teachers. 
The last five reports of the President of the Foundation have devoted considerable 
space to printing in full the resolutions used by various institutions in adopting the 
contractual plan of retiring allowances. The resolutions used for this purpose during 
the past year having been generally similar to those adopted and printed in preceding 
years, it now appears possible and appropriate to assemble the most significant char- 
acteristics of the resolutions and experience of all the institutions that have adopted 
the system of contractual annuities into a brief and a comprehensive statement which 
may be studied, adopted wholly or in part, or condensed for the sake of simplicity, by 
institutions that are now considering or will consider later the problem of contractual 
retiring allowances. 
There is, therefore, presented the following: 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  36 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
CONDENSED PLAN 
OF ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE 
1. Any professor, instructor, or administrative officer of equivalent rank in this 
College may become entitled to the benefits of the annuities hereby established, by 
agreeing to contribute annually in monthly instalments five per cent of his salary 
toward an old age annuity. 
2. The College will contribute annually in monthly instalments, during the period 
of employment, an amount equal to five per cent of the annual salary of each member 
making contributions as provided in Section 1. 
8. The deferred Annuity Policy, Teachers Retirement Plan, of the Teachers In- 
surance and Annuity Association of America, is made the basis of the annuity plan 
of the College. The contract provides, ordinarily, for a monthly deferred annuity to 
begin at the age of sixty-five, the amount of this annuity being determined, in ac- 
cordance with the policy, by the amount and number of the contributions paid. The 
contract provides also alternate methods of settlement, with the effect that the mem- 
ber controls the date at which the annuity may begin and may, at the time of retire- 
ment, choose that form of annuity best adapted to his needs. The various forms of 
annuity available to a member at retirement, either upon the life of the member or 
upon the joint lives of himself and his wife, or with a possible return to his estate, are 
fully stated in the policy. 
4, Should the holder of such a contract die before payment of the annuity has 
begun, an amount equal to all contributions on his policy paid by himself and by 
the College, with compound interest at four per cent, and any additional interest that 
may be voted by the Trustees of the Association, will be paid to his wife, or other 
designated beneficiary, or to his estate, in one hundred and twenty equal monthly in- 
stalments. Should the annuitant so request, this amount may be paid in a single pay- 
ment. Should his wife or other beneficiary of the immediate family so request, it will 
be paid in the form of an annuity covering her life. A member leaving the service of 
the College to go to a university, college, or other institution devoted primarily to 
education or research may continue his annuity accumulation upon such terms of 
joint contribution as he may arrange with that college or university, or continue his 
contributions independently, or allow the contributions already made to accumulate 
without further contribution, or he may begin the receipt of his annuity at once. 
Should he withdraw altogether from the work of teaching or research, he will remain 
the owner of his policy; he will be entitled to the full benefit purchased by the con- 
tributions already made, and, if he so desires, he will have the privilege himself to 
continue the accumulation by the payment of premiums at the rate stated in the 
policy, but without reduction on account of a preferred occupation. Or he may allow 
the accumulation to continue without the payment of further premiums, or he may 
begin the receipt of his annuity at once.
-P-A-G-E-49
  FORMS FOR USE OF UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES 37 
5. The amount contributed by each member shall be deducted monthly from the 
salary of such member, and, together with the monthly contribution of the College 
on his or her account, shall be paid direct to the Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association. 
6. Any member desiring to make contributions in excess of five per cent of his 
salary has opportunity to do so in accordance with the terms of the deferred annuity 
contract. Such contributions in excess of five per cent will not be duplicated by the 
College. 
7. The College has not yet made specific arrangements for supplementary annui- 
ties for its older teachers, who will not have time to accumulate adequate annuities 
in the ordinary way, but intends making whatever addition to the contractual annu- 
ities may be possible. 
8. All members of the College, whether or not they become contributors toward 
annuities, are entitled as individuals to the privilege of obtaining life insurance in the 
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America upon the unusually favor- 
able terms which the Association offers to college teachers. 
9. The College will assist those of its members who desire to secure the convenient 
privileges of monthly payments of premiums on individual annuity contracts or on 
life insurance contracts by arranging for the automatic deduction of their premiums 
from salary and their payment direct to the Association. 
10. The College reserves the right to modify, amend, or repeal this plan as expe- 
rience may prove desirable. Any such changes, however, shall not affect any benefits 
acquired prior to the adoption of these changes, except upon specific agreement be- 
tween the members concerned and the College. 
For larger institutions or more detailed study there is presented the following: 
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN 
OF ANNUITIES AND INSURANCE 
Articte I 
Membership 
Section 1. The term “member” as used in the articles constituting this plan shall be 
held to mean all officers, teachers, investigators, and other persons permanently in 
the employ of the University on a regular basis of salary, as determined by the Board 
of Trustees of the University. 
Note. Most institutions include, as yet, only full-time professors and instructors and academic and 
administrative officers of similar rank. Regularity and permanency are sometimes defined in the res- 
olution as the receipt of a specified minimum salary ; the attainment of a certain age, such as twenty- 
five or thirty; or the previous completion of a specific period of service, such as one, two, or three years, 
‘or, in one instance each, four or five years, in the institution concerned, or a similar institution.

members and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America and not 
among the members nor with the University, the University’s codperation being on 
the same basis as its existing obligation to pay salaries to members receiving salaries. 
Articte II 
Annuities 
Section 1. The deferred Annuity Policy, Teachers Retirement Plan, of the Teach- 
ers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, is made the basis of the annuity 
plan of the University. This policy is fully described in the Handbook of the Asso- 
ciation, which may be had on request. Specimen copies of the contract may be had 
from the Association or the University. The University will codperate under the plan 
of contributions, to be explained, in the purchase of such an annuity policy for each 
member who enters the retirement system. The annuity contract will become the 
property of the member, and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association will 
keep separate account of the payments on each such contract. The contract will pro- 
vide, ordinarily, for a monthly deferred annuity to begin at the age of sixty-five, the 
amount of this annuity being determined, in accordance with the policy, by the 
number and amount of the contributions paid. The contract will also provide alter- 
native methods of settlement, with the effect that the member will control the date 
at which the annuity shall begin and may, at the time of retirement, choose that 
form of annuity best adapted to his needs. The various forms of annuity available 
to a member at retirement, either upon the life of the member or upon the joint lives 
of himself and his wife, or with a return to his estate, are fully stated in the policy. 
Note. The age of optional and compulsory retirement is usually fixed by other University regulations. 
The minimum ages specified are 55 or 60; the maximum, 68 or 70. Ordinarily, retirement takes place 
at the end of the academic year during which the age determined upon is reached. 
Sxcrion 2. Should the member die before payment of the annuity has begun, an 
amount equal to all contributions on his policy paid by himself and by the Univer- 
sity, with compound interest at four per cent, and any additional interest that may 
be voted by the Trustees of the Association, will be paid to his wife, or other des- 
ignated beneficiary, or to his estate, in one hundred and twenty equal monthly 
instalments. Should the annuitant and the University so request, this amount may 
be paid in a single payment. Should his wife or other beneficiary of the immediate 
family so request, it will be paid in the form of an annuity covering her life. A mem- 
ber leaving the service of the University to go to a university, college, or other insti- 
tution devoted primarily to education or research may continue his annuity accu- 
mulation upon such terms of joint contribution as he may arrange with that college 
or university, or continue his contributions independently, or allow the contribu- 
tions already made to accumulate without further contribution, or he may begin 
the receipt of his annuity at once. Should he withdraw altogether from the work of
-P-A-G-E-51
FORMS FOR USE OF UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES 39 
teaching or research, he will remain the owner of his policy; he will be entitled to 
the full benefit purchased by the contributions already made, and, if he so desires, 
he will have the privilege himself to continue the accumulation by the payment of 
premiums at the rate stated in the policy, but without reduction on account of a 
preferred occupation. Or he may allow the accumulation to continue without the 
payment of further premiums, or he may begin the receipt of his annuity at once. 
Srcrion 3. The University will contribute annually in monthly instalments, dur- 
ing the period of employment, an amount equal to five per cent of the annual sal- 
ary of each member making contributions as provided in Section 4. 
Note. A minimum contribution of $60 a year has been fixed by one institution. Maximum annual 
contributions of $180, $200, $225, $250, or $300 have been fixed by some. Others limit the prospec- 
tive annuity from the joint contributions of the annuitant and the employing institution to $1500, 
$2000, $3000, $4000, or $10,000 a year. During leaves of absence contributions may be continued, re- 
duced, or intermitted, with corresponding modification of the prospective annuity. There is little to 
be said for any limitation of contribution other than by the adequate, conservative rate of five per 
cent of salary. The teacher who deserves his salary deserves a comparable annuity, and any reduc- 
tion in its adequacy will delay desirable or embitter compulsory retirement. 
Srcrioy 4. Each member who so desires may become entitled to participate in the 
benefits of the annuities hereby established, by agreeing to contribute annually in 
monthly instalments five per cent of his salary toward an old age annuity. Failure 
of any member to make such agreement prior to [whatever date may be determined], 
in the case of present members, and prior to one year after the date of appointment 
to such membership in the case of future members, shall be considered a relinquish- 
ment of any right to participate in the plan and as releasing the University from any 
obligation toward a retiring allowance for such members. 
Note. Twenty-four institutions require contributions toward annuities as a regular condition of ap- 
pointment for those entering the service after the inauguration of the plan. These are: Chicago, 
Clark, Colorado College, Fisk, General Education Board, Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, Uni- 
versity of Michigan, Oberlin, Occidental, Packer, Peking Union Medical College, University of 
Pittsburgh, Queen’s, Rockefeller Foundation, Toronto, Trinity (N. C.), Vanderbilt, Wesleyan, West- 
ern Reserve, Whitman, and Williams. New York University and Ripon College contribute for all of 
their full-time permanent officers, instructors, and professors, whether they contribute or not. Stan- 
ford contributes the entire ten per centof his salary foreach such officer or teacher. Some arrangement 
of this kind will gradually be adopted almost universally. No institution can escape some responsibility 
for the retirement of its teachers, and the only safe and adequate arrangement is to accumulate the 
provision for retirement throughout the annuitant’s period of service. 
Sxcrion 5. The amount contributed by each member, as provided in Section 4, 
shall be deducted monthly from the salary of such member, and, together with the 
monthly contribution of the University on his or her account, shall be paid to the 
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association as consideration for a deferred annu- 
ity contract upon the life of that person. 
Note. Payments may be made in instalments other than monthly, if this be desired. Resolutions 
occasionally allow ‘‘some other form of contract with the Association or some other company, the 
contract and company to be approved in each case by the Trustees of the University.” 
Srcrion 6. The University shall provide a suitable place for the safekeeping of 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
    40 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
annuity and insurance policies. Every deferred annuity policy toward which the Uni- 
versity contributes under this article shall be deposited with the University for safe- 
keeping and as evidence of the policy-holder’s acceptance of the annuity plan, and 
agreement that it shall not be assigned, pledged, or surrendered without the consent 
of the University, and shall be delivered to the owner only upon the termination of 
his active service, at which time all obligations of the University shall cease. A receipt 
for such deposit will be given to the owner of the policy. 
Srction 7. Any member desiring to make contributions in excess of five per cent 
of his salary has opportunity to do so in accordance with the terms of the deferred 
annuity contract. Such contributions in excess of five per cent will not be duplicated 
by the University, but the additional annuity thus procured will not operate to limit 
the codperation of the University as stated. 
Articie III 
Supplementary Annuities 
Sxction 1. In order to provide for retirement on a minimum annuity, particularly for 
those members whose contributions may not be sufficient on account of advanced age 
to procure such an annuity at retirement, the University has created a reserve fund 
from which supplementary annuities will be provided under the following conditions: 
Sxcrion 2. The minimum annuity shall be [whatever swm is decided upon. 
Section 3. Members in the service of the University on [date of adoption of the 
plan], who enter into the annuity plan before [whatever date thereafter may be fixed] 
and contribute toward an annuity as provided in Article II, shall be entitled, after 
at least ten years of active service in the University, to retirement on the minimum 
annuity upon attaining the ages shown in the following schedule: 
Age at Adoption of the Plan Entitled to Retirement at Age 
50 years and over 68 
Over 40 years and under 50 67 
Over 35 years and under 40 66 
Under 35 years 65 
Section 4. The Trustees of the University have adopted resolutions which, without 
imposing a legal obligation upon the University, state its intention to purchase from 
the reserve fund of the University the following supplementary annuities for persons 
who are entitled to retirement on minimum annuities, as stated above: 
(a) If the member retiring is unmarried or is a woman, the supplementary annuity 
shall be such an annuity as, added to the life annuity provided by the contributions 
of the member and of the University on his or her account under Sections 1, 2, and 3 
of Article II, shall produce a life annuity equal to [whatever sum may be fixed]. 
(0) If the member retiring is a man whose wife is living, the supplementary an- 
nuity shall be such an annuity as, added to the annuity available under Option III
-P-A-G-E-53
FORMS FOR USE OF UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES 41 
of the Deferred Annuity Policy, provided by the contributions of the member and of 
the University on his account under Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Article II, would pro- 
duce an annuity equal to [whatever sum may be fixed] during the life of the member, 
with the continuation of the annuity for one-half the annual amount to his widow 
while she survives. 
Sxcrion 5. The right to supplementary annuities, as described in the preceding 
sections of this Article, accrues only when the participant becomes entitled to re- 
tirement. 
Section 6. The University reserves to itself the right to make special arrangements 
concerning supplementary annuities with future members who may enter the service 
of the University after this plan is adopted, and whose contributions may not be suffi- 
cient, on account of advanced age, to procure an adequate annuity before retirement. 
Section 7. The provision for supplementary annuities is purely voluntary, and con- 
tract rights are not created on the part of a member to participation in the reserve 
fund, or to receive payments therefrom. Furthermore, the plan of supplementary 
annuities may be terminated if found to be impracticable. It is, however, believed to 
be entirely feasible and the University intends to carry it out unless and until ex- 
perience demonstrates the contrary in the judgment of its Board of Trustees. 
Note. This arrangement for supplementary annuities is that of the Carnegie Foundation and the 
Carnegie Institution. The General Education Board; the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial, and 
the Rockefeller Foundation have adopted the following: 
“*In case of every person who is in the service of the Foundation at the time the Retiring Allowance 
Plan becomes effective, and who participates in it, a contribution shall be made by the Foundation 
to the insurance company which shall be sufficient to provide an annuity policy equal in value on that 
date to the one which he then would have had if the plan had been in operation when he entered the 
Foundation’s employ.” 
The University of British Columbia, Bryn Mawr College, and Marietta College duplicate, for their 
older teachers, contributions that are larger than five per cent of their salaries. Most universities and 
colleges have not yet made specific arrangements for supplementary annuities for their older teachers 
who are not protected by the Carnegie Foundation, but express the intention of making later what- 
ever addition to the contractual annuities may be possible. A number of institutions have begun the 
accumulation of special funds for this purpose. 
Articte IV 
Disability Allowances 
Sxcrion 1. The University will grant to its members disability allowances upon the 
following conditions: 
Srcrion 2. Disability shall be interpreted to mean total permanent disability as 
certified by a medical examiner designated by the University and occurring while in 
the employment of the University. 
Srcrion 3. A member of the University, in order to be eligible to a disability al- 
lowance, must have contributed not less than five years toward an old age annuity 
in the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, as provided in Article II, and 
must have been in active service during this period.  
-P-A-G-E-54
  42 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
Sxcrion 4. When retired on the ground of disability, the member so retired shall 
assign, or cause to be assigned, his annuity policy in the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association to the University, and the member will furthermore empower 
the University, in the event of such retirement, in his name and by irrevocable power 
of attorney, to assign such policy to itself, to the end that the University shall be- 
come the sole owner of all interests in such policy. 
Sxcrion 5. The University will, in compliance with these conditions, provide an 
annuity of two-thirds of the amount the member would have obtained had he con- 
tinued to the age of sixty-five an average annual contribution equal to his average 
annual contribution during the five years immediately preceding his disability, and 
the University continued its equivalent contribution. These annuity payments will 
continue for life, and in case of death until the remainder of the accumulation to the 
credit of the individual has been returned to his estate. Disability allowances will be 
limited to a maximum of [whatever swum may be determined upon], and are subject 
to discontinuance in case of recovery of health on the part of the member. In case 
of such recovery, the unexpended portion of the contributions made by and for the 
annuitant, together with its accumulations, shall remain to his credit. 
Srcrion 6. This disability benefit will be available to members now in the service 
of the University and to those, it is intended, who may enter such service up to 
[whatever date may be determined], and, to the extent and subject to the approval 
of the Board of Trustees of the University, to those becoming members thereafter. 
It is assumed that after some period of experience, perhaps twenty years, accurate 
information will be available so that the disability benefit can be included in the 
regular annuity contract at a rate approximating its actual cost. 
Secrion 7. This plan of disability allowances has had, as yet, but limited trial, so 
that the results cannot yet be forecast with absolute confidence, and therefore the 
University provides this feature of the plan experimentally and without imposing a 
contract or legal liability therefor. In the event of discontinuance of the plan, the 
policies will be reassigned to the insured in such form that the member may retain 
the right to any unused benefit of the policy theretofore accrued on payments made 
under the policy. 
ote. For teachers in institutions that are associated with the Carnegie Foundation, who participate 
in the contributory plan of annuities maintained by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, 
disability allowances of the kind described above are provided at the cost of the Carnegie Foundation. 
ArticLe V 
Life Insurance 
Sxcrion 1. All members of the University, whether or not they become contributors 
toward annuities as provided in Article II, are by virtue of their appointment in the 
University entitled as individuals to the privilege of obtaining annuities and life
-P-A-G-E-55
FORMS FOR USE OF UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES 43 
insurance in the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America upon the 
unusually favorable terms which the Association offers to college teachers. 
Srcrion 2. The chief legitimate use of life insurance is to protect the wife and 
family of the insured against dependence in the case of his premature death. Obli- 
gation to provide this protection rests upon the individual ; the organization of which 
he is a member is not called upon to share in its cost, beyond such provisions for pay- 
ment of annuity accumulations in case of death before retirement or the continuance 
of an annuity for the benefit of a surviving wife or other beneficiary as are appro- 
priate to an old age annuity contract. 
Secrion 3. The life insurance and annuity policies of the Teachers Insurance and 
Annuity Association not only are offered at net rates and, therefore, upon terms less 
expensive than those of ordinary companies, but have also been devised with special 
reference to men working upon fixed salaries. Different individuals may properly 
seek different kinds of insurance. Among the policies offered by the Association may 
be found those adapted to the varying conditions of individual income and individual 
obligation. In the case of a man upon a fixed salary, adequate protection for himself 
and for his family will generally be most economically and securely obtained by the 
combination of term insurance with an old age annuity contract. 
Sxcrion 4. The life insurance policies of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity As- 
sociation provide for “waiver of premium,” that is, the continuance of the policy in 
full force without further payment of premiums, in the event of the insured becoming 
permanently and totally disabled before reaching the age of sixty-five. 
Section 5. The Handbook of the Association contains a full explanation of the 
various life insurance policies which it offers, the premium rates at which they are 
issued, and the further reduction of these rates by the annual dividends that have 
been paid. Copies of the Handbook may be obtained from the Association or the 
University. Specimen policies, forms for application, and further information will be 
furnished upon request by the officers of the Association, who are glad to afford in- 
formation and advice, and to assist the individual in the choice of the most suitable 
policies. ; 
Note. It is of great advantage to policy-holders in the Association that they deal directly with disin- 
terested and responsible officers, rather than through agents, who have no authority to bind their 
companies and whose interests in different forms of contracts are inevitably affected by the varying 
commissions that they yield. 
Sxcrion 6. The University will assist those of its members who desire to secure the 
convenient privilege of monthly payments of premiums on individual annuity con- 
tracts or on life insurance contracts by arranging for the automatic deduction of their 
premiums from salary and their payment direct to the Association, in accordance with 
the plan announced in the Handbook of the Association.

Amendments 
The University reserves the right to modify, amend, or repeal this plan as experience 
may prove desirable. Any such changes, however, shall not affect any benefits acquired 
prior to the adoption of these changes, except upon specific agreement between the 
members concerned and the University. The University may also discontinue any 
feature of the plan, but such discontinuance shall not affect rights under policies 
guaranteed by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association in consideration of 
premium payments previously made. 
  The clarity of any set of resolutions is enhanced by appropriate illustrations. The 
following, representing the benefits of a man entering a service at the age of thirty,

The officers of the Carnegie Foundation or of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity 
Association are glad at any time to confer or correspond with institutions that are 
considering contractual annuities, and to give their suggestions concerning the pro- 
visions and form of resolutions that are proposed. 
PROGRESS OF THE TEACHERS INSURANCE 
AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION 
Tur Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America completed its fifth year 
on December 31,1923. The Association has earned for itself an honorable place among 
organizations devoted to the writing of annuity and insurance contracts, and its re- 
sponsibility and disinterestedness have become recognized, not alone by the insur- 
ance world and by those universities, colleges, and research institutions that have 
adopted the contributory retirement plan for their officers and teachers, but also by 
the profession of college teachers in general. During the fifth year of the Association’s 
activity its progress has been rather more marked than in any previous period of its 
history. This is a source of particular gratification in its demonstration that the Asso- 
ciation is no longer regarded as in an experimental stage, and especially in that its 
progress has been based, from the inherent nature of the project, upon demonstrated 
merit alone. The action of more than one hundred universities, colleges, and similar 
institutions in formally adopting the Association’s system of contractual annuities is 
discussed elsewhere in this report. 
The stages in the advancement of the Association may be represented by the fol- 
lowing comparative table, reprinted from its Fifth Annual Report, which will be mailed 
to any one who is interested:

Total Assets $1,073,003 $1,259,890 $1,591,291 $2,220,294 $3,094,992 
These figures, it will be observed, run only to December 31, 1923. The situation 
as regards annuity and insurance contracts in force as of September 30, 1924, as com- 
pared with those of one year previous, may be put as follows: 
Date No. Insurance Policies Total Insurance No. Annuity Contracts Total Annual Annuity 
September 30, 1923 2,057 $10,889,795 1,755 $2,267,280 
September 30, 1924 2,607 13,835,643 2,573 3,845,873 
Such statistics take on a new emphasis when viewed in the light of certain factors 
in the management and operation of the Association. The Association makes safety 
its first consideration: it is therefore operated conservatively. Because of its endow- 
ment of a million dollars in the form of paid-in capital and surplus from the Carne- 
gie Corporation of New York, it is actuated only by two motives: to assist college 
teachers to provide against the reduction or loss of income contingent upon long life 
or early death, and to make its life insurance policies and annuity contracts as se- 
1 No policies had completed their first year in 1919. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  PROGRESS OF INSURANCE AND ANNUITY ASSOCIATION 47 
cure as possible. The Association is required by its Charter to “conduct its business 
without profit to the corporation or to its stockholders.” Thus, it is in no sense a 
competitor of commercial insurance companies. If, however, it is to fulfil its purpose, 
it must provide the maximum of security at the minimum of cost. One result of this 
fact is to be found in its practice as regards reinsurance. The Board of Trustees has 
authorized the acceptance of a maximum insurance of $25,000, of which on the En- 
dowment, Limited Payment, or Ordinary Life policy the amount to be carried by 
the Association itself is $15,000, leaving $10,000 to be reinsured in a sound com- 
mercial company. As regards policies involving Term Insurance, the amount issued 
by the Association is limited to $10,000. 
In view of the resources of the Association, such a practice can be regarded only 
as eminently conservative. On the other hand, the variety and possible combinations 
of policies and contracts which the Association offers fit or readily adapt themselves 
to the needs of the college teacher. In pursuance of the attempt to adjust practices 
closely to these needs, the Board has authorized the payment of annuity accumula- 
tions, which previously had to be disbursed in one hundred and twenty equal monthly 
instalments, in one lump sum, if the prospective annuitant dies before the payment 
of the instalments has begun, and if the annuitant and the contributing institution 
jointly agree to such an arrangement. Such a sum due to a widow or other member of 
the immediate family of an annuitant may also be taken in the form of an annuity cov- 
ering the life of the beneficiary. The Board, moreover, has ruled favorably on the eligi- 
bility of certain members of the military and naval forces of the United States, thus: 
“Regular teachers in universities and colleges, who are members of the National 
Guard, the Naval Reserve Force, or the Officers Reserve Corps, are eligible . . . 
retired officers of the Army and Navy who are teaching in universities and col- 
leges are eligible only when they become primarily teachers.” 
This policy of alert and sound conservatism represents not only the primary in- 
tention of the Association, but the belief and interests of the Board of Trustees. Of 
the sixteen members of the present Board, who serve without compensation, six were 
members of the original Board, which took office in 1918, and three have been elected 
on the direct nomination of the policy-holders. A fourth trustee thus chosen will 
become a member of the Board during the ensuing year. Professor Thomas Sewell 
Adams, of Yale University, took his seat on the Board of Trustees in 1922. Professor 
Samuel McCune Lindsay, of Columbia University, elected in 1921, has been named 
a member of the Executive Committee. The latest of the trustees nominated by the 
policy-holders, President Frank Aydelotte, of Swarthmore College, took office in 1923 
for the term extending to 1927. President Aydelotte was elected by the stockholders 
of the Association, on his being reported by the Policy-holders Committee as having 
received the largest number of recommendations from the 898 policy-holders who 
answered the request of their committee for suggestions. His experience as a teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  48 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
at the University of Indiana and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and also 
as an administrator, through his activities as American secretary to the Rhodes Trus- 
tees, and as a trustee of the Carnegie Foundation, through his services in educational 
fields to the Government during the war, and finally through his work as president of 
Swarthmore, will render his trusteeship of special value to both the Association and 
its policy-holders. 
The death on September 26, 1923, of Mr. Allen Boyd Forbes, president of Harris, 
Forbes and Company, a trustee from the establishment of the Association and chair- 
man of the Finance Committee, deprived the Association of one of its staunchest 
friends. The resolutions of the trustees in his memory read, in part: 
“The fact that trustees of the Association serve without any financial reward 
and as a public service gave Mr. Forbes a special pleasure in putting his great 
knowledge of investment matters at the service of an agency which itself made 
no profits but offered to teachers a service at cost and placed within their reach 
the means of protecting themselves and their dependents against the hazards of 
life.” 
The trustees filled the place of Mr. Forbes by electing as a trustee his colleague 
in the firm of Harris, Forbes and Company, Mr. Howard F. Beebe, who has also 
been named a member of the Finance Committee. Thus the trustees of the Associ- 
ation include, in approximately equal numbers, eminent members of the teaching 
profession, most of whom have been directly named to represent the policy-holders, 
together with educational administrators of large experience, and also representatives 
of large insurance, financial, and legal interests, all of whom give generously of their 
wisdom and seasoned experience for the guidance of the Association. 
One other evidence of the conservativeness of the Association should be mentioned. 
The last Annual Report of the Foundation contained a brief discussion of “The 
Life Expectation of College Teachers,” wherein it was pointed out that teachers who 
have been in receipt of retiring allowances from the Foundation have enjoyed some- 
what longer lives than might have been anticipated under the McClintock Tables 
of Mortality, which are considered conservative and are prescribed by the Insurance 
Law of the State of New York as applicable to annuity contracts. The Teachers In- 
surance and Annuity Association has from its inception earned a margin in excess 
of the legal reserve on the basis of the McClintock Tables and four per cent interest. 
Nevertheless, the trustees have chosen to make assurance doubly sure by setting up 
a special annuity reserve, designated as a Contingency Reserve, to consist of a por- 
tion of the earnings equal to one-half of one per cent of the premiums received by 
the Association on all annuity contracts issued on the Teachers Retirement Plan. 
This is in addition to the one-half of one per cent which the trustees have voted to 
credit on all annuity contracts, over and above the contractual four per cent interest 
accumulation, the highest allowed by law. 
Thus the policy-holders of the Association may rest assured that their interests are
-P-A-G-E-61

thoroughly safeguarded in all of these several ways: first, by a sound and conserva- 
tive management, which is made possible only by the character, experience, and stand- 
ing of the men who now constitute the Board of Trustees; secondly, by the practice 
of seeking from holders of policies nominations for trustees, recommendations con- 
cerning contracts, and suggestions for administration; and thirdly, because, in con- 
trast to a commercial company, the only persons who receive any financial benefit 
from the operation of the Association are the policy-holders themselves. 
Two legal matters which have arisen during the year are of importance as bearing 
upon the work of the Association. The first, a decision handed down on January 14, 
1928, by the Supreme Court of the United States, relates to the case of the Minne- 
sota Commercial Men’s Association vs. Benn (43 Sup. Ct. 293), and bears upon in- 
surance companies or organizations doing business within a state by mail from a 
home office in another state. 
“ An application for insurance in a Minnesota insurance company was sent by 
mail from the residence of the applicant in Montana to the home office of the 
company... . The application was solicited by a member of the association who 
had no authority to bind the insurer. Members are procured by this association 
by advertisement and through the solicitation of older members, but no solicit- 
ing agent receiving compensation is employed. Losses are settled by checks on 
the Minneapolis banks mailed from the home office. . . . The Minnesota corpo- 
ration was insuring a citizen of Montana without securing a license to do busi- 
ness in Montana and in fact claiming that it was not doing business in Montana 
so as to subject it to the power of a Montana court in a suit upon the policy by 
serving the insurance commissioner. The opinion of Justice McReynolds says: 
‘We think it cannot be said that the association was doing business in Montana 
merely because one or more members, without authority to obligate it, solicited 
new members. It also seems sufficiently clear . . . that an insurance company is 
not doing business within a state merely because it insures lives of persons living 
therein, mails notices addressed to the beneficiaries at their homes and pays losses 
by checks from its home office.’”! 
The application of this important decision to the work of the Teachers Insurance 
and Annuity Association is plain. The Association is incorporated under the laws of 
New York State, and over such a body other states have no legal control. It may be 
remarked parenthetically that the Insurance Law of the State of New York is among 
the most stringent of state laws upon the subject. Under the law, the several states 
possess exclusive authority over business done within their borders. But, as Justice 
McReynolds said, “an insurance company is not doing business within a state merely 
because it insures lives of persons living therein,” etc. Were it not for the Constitu- 
tion and its limitations enforced by the Supreme Court, the Association would be sub- 
ject to supervision, taxation, and suit in the most remote state or territory, regard- 
less of where its policies and contracts were originally issued. Thus the Association

is protected and enabled to do its work in any state of the Union by the “ Due Pro- 
cess Clause” in Section I of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. 
The second legal topic is an opinion by counsel of the Association, Messrs. Root, 
Clark, Buckner, and Howland, of New York City, based upon a ruling of the Bureau 
of Internal Revenue dated January 7, 1924. For some time there has been question 
whether holders of deferred annuity contracts under the Teachers Retirement Plan 
should report as income for purposes of taxation that portion of the annual contribu- 
tion toward retiring annuities paid by the employing institution. The opinion of coun- 
sel is to the effect that “‘ payments to the Association by institutions toward annuity 
contracts for their employees do not constitute taxable income to such employees 
and should not be reported as compensation to the Bureau of Internal Revenue.” 
One of the gratifying features of the work of the Association is the promptness 
with which death claims under insurance policies are paid. During the year the As- 
sociation has settled in full the following death claims, in no case longer than two 
days after the receipt of proofs of death or letters of appointment of administrators 
of the estate:

The operation of the waiver which enables the discontinuance of premiums in case 
of total disability is illustrated in the case of Adelaide Imogene Locke, Assistant 
Professor of Biblical History at Wellesley College, who became totally and, as events 
turned out, permanently disabled in October, 1923. During the continuance of Miss 
Locke’s disability, until her death, in May, 1924, no premiums upon her two life 
insurance policies needed to be paid, and at her death the policies were paid in full. 
In one more year, Professor Locke would have become eligible for a disability allow- 
ance under the rules of this Foundation. The adjustment of the practices of the 
Carnegie Foundation with the needs of holders of contracts from the Teachers Insur- 
ance and Annuity Association is one of the most satisfactory phases of the develop- 
ment of Mr. Carnegie’s beneficent provision for the profession of college teachers. 
During the spring of 1924, the Superintendent of Insurance, State of New York, 
caused to be made, in accordance with legal requirements, the careful and minute 
triennial valuation and inspection of the books, business, and affairs of the Associa- 
tion. The report of the Superintendent will be available later.

  CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 51 
HOW MUCH INSURANCE OUGHT A TEACHER TO CARRY? 
Pracricatty every right thinking man of to-day realizes that his duty to his de- 
pendents and to society necessitates his carrying an adequate amount of life insur- 
ance protection. Perhaps Mr. Carnegie most concisely summed up the value of life 
insurance in his statement, “Insurance brings peace and prevents ruin to innumer- 
able lives and homes.” The truth of this statement can be vouched for by all those 
who have come in contact with a family bereft of its income producer. In all such 
cases the question “How much life insurance did he leave?” is of paramount im- 
portance. 
What constitutes an adequate amount of life insurance? This is a question that 
can be answered only in general terms when applied to teachers in general, since 
much depends upon individual circumstances as to financial resources, number of de- 
pendents, whether or not such dependents are capable of becoming income producers, 
and on similar details. 
As a typical case, consider the problem of a teacher aged thirty who is receiving 
a salary of $2000, and who expects to receive an increased salary amounting to $3000 
at age thirty-five, $4000 at age forty, and $5000 at age forty-five. Let us assume that 
his institution codperates with him in the purchase of a Deferred Annuity Contract, 
Teachers Retirement Plan, five per cent of his salary being applied as premiums on the 
policy and an equal amount being contributed by his institution. Under the provision 
calling for the return of premiums with interest in event of death before retirement, 
the amounts of such returns would be $1000 at thirty-five, $3000 at forty, $6000 
at forty-five, $10,000 at fifty, $15,000 at fifty-five, $21,000 at sixty, and $28,000 
at age sixty-five. The problem of this teacher is to decide how much life insurance 
to carry to cover the risk of early death. Five per cent of his salary would purchase 
a $10,000 Decreasing Life Insurance policy, which has been prepared as a compan- 
ion policy to the Deferred Annuity Contract. As he becomes older and receives in- 
creases in salary, he could take out on the Whole Life plan additional life insurance 
amounting to $2500 at thirty-five, $2000 at forty, and $1500 at forty-five, without 
paying out more than five per cent of salary for life insurance. Were this plan of 
devoting five per cent of salary toward an annuity and another five per cent toward 
life insurance put into operation, the teacher’s family would be protected to the ex- 
tent of $10,000 in case of his death at thirty, $13,500 at thirty-five, $17,500 at forty, 
$20,500 at forty-five, $23,000 at fifty, $26,500 at fifty-five, $31,000 at sixty, and 
$36,500 at sixty-five. After his retirement on an annuity of $265 a month at sixty- 
five, the amount of life insurance would materially decrease. 
What has been the effect of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association on 
the life insurance carried by college teachers? Briefly, it has been the means of doub- 
ling the amount of insurance carried by the teacher with whom it has come in con- 
tact. To illustrate: The average amount of insurance already carried by teachers
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 CURRENT QUESTIONS OF THE YEAR 
applying to the Association was $7500. Such teachers have duplicated this amount 
in the Association so that their average total protection is now $15,000. This has 
taken place because the Association has brought home to them the fact that low- 
cost policies which are specially adapted to their needs can be secured by direct com- 
munication with an organization which, unlike an agent, is financially disinterested 
in its advice, The freedom of the policy contracts from the cost of management, which 
amounts to some twenty per cent of the annual income of the typical commercial 
company, has resulted in furnishing insurance to teachers at substantial annual 
savings. 
All of the standard forms of life insurance policies are issued by the Association. 
While the purpose of policies on the Whole Life, Limited Payment Life, and Term 
plans is to furnish either permanent or temporary protection for dependents, teach- 
ers may make use of Endowment policies as a fund to educate children, to pay off a 
mortgage on a home, or as a fund for savings. Women and unmarried men frequently 
insure in favor of a mother, father, sister, brother, or intimate associate, reserving the 
right to change the beneficiary should future conditions so warrant. 
In addition to the standard forms, the Association issues certain policies specially 
adapted to the needs of teachers which cannot be had elsewhere. Chief among these 
is the Decreasing Life Insurance policy, which has been prepared as a companion pol- 
icy to the Deferred Annuity Contract, Teachers Retirement Plan. By means of a 
combination of these two policies the hazards of early death or dependency in old 
age are fully covered. Other forms of contracts not generally issued by commercial 
companies are long Term policies, expiring at an age as advanced as seventy, and 
Survivorship Annuities. All of these contracts are fully described in the Handbook 
of the Association, copies of which may be found in most college libraries and are 
available to individuals on request. 
INVESTMENTS 
Tue question of the proper investment and care of the funds of the Foundation is 
one of the most serious obligations which its officers and trustees must face. In the 
earlier days of the Foundation the entire funds were in the first mortgage bonds of 
the United States Steel Corporation as they had come from the donor. The funds of 
the Foundation include, to-day, not only some fifteen millions of dollars par value of 
the general endowment of the Foundation, but also one million three hundred and 
twenty-two thousand dollars par value as endowment of the Division of Educa- 
tional Enquiry, and some eleven million dollars in addition in its three reserve funds, 
amounting altogether to approximately twenty-eight million dollars. 
In the general endowment of the Foundation there still remains twelve million 
dollars par value of the United States Steel Corporation five per cent first mortgage 
bonds, but as these bonds are now being rapidly paid off by the corporation, their 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  INVESTMENTS 53 
reinvestment becomes one of the most important questions with which the trustees 
have to deal. 
The Reserve Fund requirements call for investments of a different character. Re- 
serve Funds Number One and Number Two will in time be exhausted, both princi- 
pal and interest. It is desirable, therefore, to invest the funds of these reserves in se- 
curities maturing within the next twenty years. The same thing holds good, to a cer- 
tain extent, for the Emergency Reserve. The trustees have been able to avail themselves 
of the service of a most competent advisory committee in the matter of investments. 
This committee has scrutinized, month by month, not only the list of securities to be 
bought, but the whole list of securities included in the present holdings of the Foun- 
dation. From time to time the committee has discussed the availability of the different 
kinds of securities, such as rails, municipal issues, public utilities, and the stronger 
industrials. It has sought to apportion the funds of the Foundation in such a way as 
to secure first security and then diversity. It is perfectly clear that security is to be 
had in the long run not by the purchase of the best offerings of the market and stor- 
ing them in a safety deposit box, but by continually scrutinizing the circumstances 
of the corporations by whom the securities are issued. During the year, the committee 
has not only bought such securities as were needed, but has also sold bonds to the 
amount of $921,000. It is by such continual inspection and close scrutiny that the 
investments of a trust like the Foundation can be kept permanently at the highest 
level. The distribution of the investments of the Foundation, all in bonds, was on 
June 30, 1924, as follows: 
United States Steel Corporation $12,000,000 
Railroads 8,068,500 
Public Utilities 4,599,500 
Industrials 2,090,000 
Governments 1,390,000

with the Eighth (1913), three special extended Bulletins dealing with legal educa- 
tion and cognate matters have been issued: 
Number Eight: The Common Law and the Case Method in American University 
Law Schools, 1915.

had without charge upon application to its office, by mail or in person. 
BAR ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS 
Progress toward the realization of the American Bar Association’s programme of 1921 
continues to be slow. Recent changes in the requirements for admission to the bar 
in the several states may most conveniently be discussed under the three heads of 
General Education, Law Study, and Exemption from Bar Examinations. 
1. General Education 
The original American Bar Association resolution required every candidate for 
admission to the bar to show that, before beginning his legal training, he had studied 
two years in a college. The Washington Conference on Legal Education qualified 
this, in 1922, by permitting equivalent educational experience to be substituted. 
Kansas had already begun to enforce this preliminary requirement of two years of 
college or their equivalent, in the case of office students. Since 1923 the State Board of 
Law Examiners have also enforced it in the case of law school students, and in May, 
1924, their rules were changed so as to remove all possible doubt that the general edu- 
cation must be secured before the legal training begins. 
No other state has a rule so stringent as this for students who begin their law 
studies this coming autumn. Ilinois and Colorado, however, have recently instituted 
a preliminary requirement of one college year or its equivalent, effective immediately. 
West Virginia will require the equivalent of two college years from applicants who 
begin their law studies in the autumn of 1925, and Illinois from those who begin 
their law studies after July 1, 1926. The Illinois rules carefully define the type of 
institution from which certificates of resident college work will be accepted; a cer- 
tificate of matriculation as a regular student, in a law school approved by the Ameri-
-P-A-G-E-70
  58 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
can Bar Association and requiring two college years for admission, will also suffice; 
other applicants —as, for instance, those who have attended pre-legal departments of 
law schools not approved by the American Bar Association —may qualify only by 
passing examinations conducted by the state university. 
Thirteen states have a preliminary requirement of a high school education or its 
equivalent. Among these, Pennsylvania has long been peculiar in requiring appli- 
cants, other than college graduates, to have some knowledge of Latin. An effort made 
last year to extend this requirement to college graduates has now been abandoned. 
Of the remaining states, fifteen require applicants to possess a certain amount of 
general education, not necessarily acquired before the beginning of their law studies. 
The standard is a high school education, or less, except in Montana, where the equiv- 
alent of two college years is demanded. Eighteen jurisdictions require no specific 
amount of general education. The only changes during the past year have been in 
Alabama and Florida, which now for the first time require applicants at least to state 
what schools they have attended. 
2. Law Study 
The resolutions of the American Bar Association affecting law study provided, 
in effect, first, that applicants should not be permitted to take the bar examination 
unless they had attended a law school; second, that they must have graduated from 
the school; third, that the course of study must occupy at least three years; fourth, 
that in the case of students who devote only part of their working time to their stud- 
ies, the course must be extended over a longer period, equivalent in the number of 
its working hours to a three-year full-time course; and fifth, that the law school must 
provide an adequate library and have among its teachers a sufficient number giving 
their entire time to the school. These standards were endorsed by the Washington 
Conference, subject to the implied qualification—which applied also to the stand- 
ards of general education—that they could be regarded as practicable only in states 
which provided sufficient educational opportunities for young men of small means. 
The first of these recommendations, making law school study obligatory, has found 
almost no favor. Everywhere except in West Virginia— and even here in the case of 
applicants who begin their law studies this autumn — the entire legal training may be 
secured in a law office. Five states, indeed, positively require all applicants—or in 
New York all having less than two years of college education—to spend at least six 
months or a year in an office. Several states, however, have taken steps designed to 
make office study amount to something. Three such advances have occurred during 
the past year. Louisiana has been added to the already considerable number of states 
that require office students to register at the beginning of their period of law study. 
Ohio, which last year had followed Michigan and Washington in lengthening the 
period of study for office students from three years to four, has now gone somewhat 
farther than these states in its attempt to regulate the study itself: the preceptor
-P-A-G-E-71
LEGAL EDUCATION 59 
must submit an affidavit that he has given actual instruction, for at least 200 hours 
per year, in a prescribed list of subjects. Finally, Illinois not only has instituted a 
four-year prescribed curriculum, and a requirement, verified by affidavit, of not less 
than 120 hours of actual legal instruction each year; in addition, it has substituted, 
for the more usual registration provision, the very stringent rule that office students 
must be examined annually by the State Board. 
This failure to eliminate office study has made it difficult for the bar admission 
authorities to follow the second recommendation of the American Bar Association, 
that only graduates of law schools shall receive credit for law school attendance. In 
the first place, there is little recognition of the fact that, while much can be said in 
favor of the policy of not excluding from the bar applicants who cannot spend any 
time in a law school, and much can be said also in favor of requiring all law school 
students to spend a specified portion of their preparatory period in contact with actual 
practice, little can be said in favor of our traditional policy of permitting applicants 
to distribute all—or, in five states, the major portion — of their preparatory period 
between office and school, in such proportion, and in such sequence, as seems good to 
them. By a natural, but unfortunate, confusion of ideas, every state seems to permit 
this combination. The two that have gone the farthest in remedying the abuses to 
which it leads are Washington and Illinois. Washington last year and Illinois this 
year regard applicants who have had a mixture of office and law school preparation 
as primarily office students, and as such subject to their new four-year requirement; 
the school work receives advanced standing credit on the regular curriculum pre- 
scribed for these office students. 
Furthermore, this general crediting of an uncompleted law-school course, when 
combined with office study, naturally reacts upon the provisions in force for appli- 
cants who have secured their entire preparation in a law school. Often no more than 
proof of attendance is required. Washington, however, requires students from ap- 
proved law schools either to present a certificate of graduation, or, after having satis- 
factorily completed the course, to spend an additional year in a law office; the alter- 
native is designed to cover the cases of special or ex-service students who have the 
high school education which entitles them to begin the study of law, but not the ad- 
ditional two years of college which most schools approved by the Board require for 
their degree. The new Illinois rule requires students from a more broadly defined type 
of law school to present a diploma showing satisfactory completion of the course. 
No change has occurred in the subject-matter of the third recommendation, which 
specifies the minimum duration of the law school course. The jurisdictions that com- 
ply with the American Bar Association standard of at least three years of law study 
number now, as in 1922, twenty-nine out of a total of forty-nine (fifty-nine per cent). 
Little progress also has been made toward compliance with the fourth recommen- 
dation, affecting part-time work. The only change during the year has been in West 
Virginia. Here the law school must be certified by the Association of American Law
-P-A-G-E-72
    60 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
Schools as complying with the American Bar Association standard of duration, textu- 
ally quoted: “It shall require its students to pursue a. . . longer course [than three 
years], equivalent in the number of working hours, if they devote only part of their 
working time to their studies.” It is not clear from the rule, however, that for bar 
admission purposes more than three years of law study is ever required, even though 
the school itself attempts to maintain a longer course. At present four states —Cali- 
fornia, Massachusetts, Ohio,and Washington —require evening or part-time students 
to devote four years to their studies in place of three, and three others— Kansas, North 
Dakota, Rhode Island— seem to follow a similar practice under less explicitly phrased 
rules, The typical graduate of a four-year evening law school can hardly be said to 
have devoted as many working hours to his studies as one who has completed a good 
three-year full-time course. No other jurisdiction, however, has gone even thus far in 
the direction of meeting the standard. In general, no distinction is made between stu- 
dents who devote themselves exclusively to the study of law, and students the major 
portion of whose time is absorbed in earning their livelihood. 
Finally, West Virginia is the only jurisdiction that specifically requires law schools 
to possess the two organic characteristics that the American Bar Association regards 
as of special importance — command of an adequate library and of a sufficient number 
of teachers giving their entire time to the school. Occasionally, as for example in Min- 
nesota and Texas, library facilities are considered, but for the most part such defini- 
tions of acceptable law schools as are attempted are either hopelessly vague, or are not 
strictly enforced. This is true even in such leading states as Kansas and Washington. 
Illinois has recently taken action, with regard to the characteristics that good law 
schools should possess, which is open to criticism on other grounds. As long ago as 
1898, the State Board adopted a rule, which has been copied in a few other states, 
that a law school, to be considered in good standing, must require recitations aver- 
aging ten hours or more each week. In their recent revision this general method of 
approach has been retained, with an increase in the number of hours from ten to twelve. 
Chicago evening law schools can readily expand their classroom schedule to conform 
to this standard. In other states evening schools sometimes oblige their students to 
receive as many as fourteen hours of instruction a week. A requirement of this sort 
is, however, a direct incentive to superficiality. Self-supporting students cannot spend 
as much time as this in the classroom and yet have adequate opportunity for outside 
preparation. To quote from remarks made by the Secretary of the Association of 
American Law Schools at the last meeting of this body: 
“The problem of these part-time schools has not been so much their requiring 
a sufficient number of hours per week, but rather requiring too much. . . . Eight 
hours a week should be rather a maximum than a minimum for effective work 
in that type of school.” 
The writer has repeatedly criticized the precise manner in which the American Bar 
121 Handbook of the Association of American Law Schools (1923), 110.
-P-A-G-E-73
LEGAL EDUCATION 61 
Association has sought to regulate part-time law study, but he has made equally clear 
his opinion that the fundamental distinction between this and full-time study should 
by all means be recognized. It is to be regretted that an important state, which has 
done so much to strengthen its system of bar admissions in other respects, not only 
has ignored the distinction in question, but has taken action which is positively det- 
rimental to the interests of young men and women of limited means, properly ambi- 
tious to enter the legal profession. 
3. Exemption from Bar Examinations 
In every state except Indiana all applicants for admission to the bar are required 
to pass an examination upon their educational qualifications, and even in Indiana 
something has been done to circumvent an antiquated constitutional provision which 
entitles every voter, of good moral character, to be admitted; several counties pro- 
vide optional examinations, failure to take which results in professional ostracism of 
the so-called “constitutional” lawyer. In some states, however, the examination is 
not in all cases conducted by public officials. In thirteen by act of legislature, and in 
Oklahoma. by a ruling of the Supreme Court and State Bar Commission, graduates 
of certain law schools, having already been examined in their respective schools, are 
exempted from the regular bar examination. This “diploma privilege,” as it is often 
termed, is usually restricted to local schools; Texas is peculiar in extending it to the 
law graduates of fourteen specified universities and of “other law schools in the United 
States . . . such as in the opinion of the board should be also included.” In addition 
to these fourteen states, the lowa Board of Law Examiners conducts one of its regular 
examinations annually at the State University, in the week following Commencement. 
The American Bar Association has repeatedly condemned the diploma. privilege— 
in 1892, in 1908, in 1918, and again in 1921. The Washington Conference on Legal 
Education took the same position in 1922. During the past three years only one state 
has changed its policy in this respect. Louisiana, by legislation adopted in July, 1924, 
has abolished the exemption previously enjoyed by graduates of all three of its local 
law schools. 
The following table summarizes the salient educational features in the bar admis- 
sion rules of the several states in so far as they affect applicants not already admitted 
to practice in another jurisdiction.

  66 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
REQUIREMENTS OF STANDARDIZING AGENCIES 
Irrespective of the movement to strengthen bar admission requirements, the Amer- 
ican Bar Association undertook in 1921 to apply pressure directly to the law schools 
by instructing its Council on Legal Education to publish the names of those schools 
which comply with its standards. A similar moral influence has been exerted for nearly 
a quarter of a century by the Association of American Law Schools, which admits to 
membership only schools that satisfy certain requirements. As was pointed out in 
a previous Report,' this organization took immediate steps to harmonize its stand- 
ards with those of the American Bar Association, in the important matter of the 
amount of general education required for admission to the school. On the other hand, 
it continued to pursue a different policy with respect to evening or part-time instruc- 
tion. There was no agreement even as to the definition of the type of work that called 
for special treatment. The suggestion was made that the two Associations might well 
come together, if public confidence was to be maintained in the standards enforced 
by either. 
During the past two years this agreement has been substantially effected. It has 
been facilitated by the fact that the composition of the Council on Legal Education 
is such as to make of it virtually a connecting link between the two organizations. The 
process of give-and-take has been as follows. The Association of American Law Schools 
has again followed the lead of the American Bar Association with respect to general 
principles. Both organizations now recognize that the problem to be faced is not the 
narrow one of what should be done in the case of students who attend night classes. 
It is the broad problem presented by students who devote only part of their work- 
ing time to their studies in institutions where instruction is scheduled at any time of 
the day that suits their special convenience, whether during the evening, or during 
the late afternoon, or at other irregular hours. Furthermore, among the law schools 
which are largely frequented by these self-supporting students are some that have 
organized two or more divisions, for one of which instruction is scheduled during the 
regular working hours of the day. The spirit and—if carefully read—even the letter 
of the American Bar Association resolutions provide that such “mixed” schools can- 
not be approved unless they comply with the required standards as regards all of their 
divisions. Both the Council on Legal Education and the Association of American Law 
Schools have explicitly taken this position. Finally, the Law School organization has 
deferred to the judgment of the American Bar Association with respect to a general 
principle which is more open to criticism on Jogical grounds. It has accepted the doc- 
trine that part-time work, if continued over a longer period, can be and should be 
the equivalent of three years of full-time study. 
In general, therefore, the Bar Association has blazed the way. The Law School 
Association, however, has formulated with greater precision the principles accepted 
117 Annual Report, Carnegie Foundation (1922), 63 (Pamphlet reprint, p. 7). 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  LEGAL EDUCATION 67 
by both organizations, and has added certain points of detail. It has done this in the 
field of entrance requirements by adopting a rule limiting the number of special stu- 
dents; in the field of full-time study by defining the length of the course in weeks, 
and thus making it possible for students to graduate in a little more than two cal- 
endar years; and in the field of part-time study by naming a specific and very low 
“equivalent” for a three-year full-time curriculum. Although the Council on Legal 
Education does not formally recognize the activities of the Association of American 
Law Schools, and makes its own independent decisions as to whether particular 
schools comply with the standards of the American Bar Association, it is naturally 
and properly guided to some extent by these minor regulations. 
The following parallel columns show how close was the agreement between the two 
organizations, in the autumn of 1924, as regards matters covered by both.! 
STANDARDS OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSO- 
CIATION AS INTERPRETED BY ITS COUNCIL 
ON LEGAL EDUCATION CORRESPONDING STANDARDS OF THE ASSO- 
CIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS 
Amount of Preliminary Education required for Admission to the Law School 
(a) It shall require as a condition of admission It shall require of all candidates for its degree 
at least two years of study in a college. at the time of their admission to the school the, 
completion either of one year of college work or 
such work as would be accepted for admission to 
the second or sophomore year in the College of 
Liberal Arts of the state university or of the prin- 
cipal colleges and universities in the state where 
the law school is located ; and, after September 1, 
1926, it shall require of all candidates for its de- 
gree at the time of their admission to the school 
either the completion of twoyears of college work 
or such work as would be accepted for admission 
to the third or junior year in the College of Lib- 
eral Arts of the state university or of the princi- 
pal colleges and universities in the state where the 
Jaw school is located. 
A school which admits certain students who do 
not fully meet the requirements will not be con- 
sidered as failing to comply with standard (a) 
provided the number of students does not exceed 
ten per cent of its enrollment. Students who enter with less than the academic 
credit required of candidates for the law degree 
by [the preceding rule] must be twenty-one years 
of age, and the number of such students admitted 
each year shall not exceed ten per cent of the 
average number of students first entering the 
school during each of the two preceding years. 
Students may register as candidates for the law 
degree, though conditioned in not to exceed three 
year-hours of college work. 
1 The Association of American Law Schools has additional requirements affecting the operation of the school as a 
non-commercial enterprise, the ascertainment of scholarship by examination, and the maintenance of a system 
of student records. Note also that in connection with the duration of the law school course it prescribes, as the 
American Bar Association does not, the amount of classroom instruction.
-P-A-G-E-80
  68 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
The Law School Course for Full-time Students 
(0) It shall require its students to pursue a course 
of three years duration if they devote substan- 
tially all of their working time to their studies, A full-time school shall require of its candi- 
dates for the first degree in law resident study of 
law during a period of at least ninety weeks, and 
the successful completion of at least ten hundred 
and eighty hours of classroom instruction in law. 
Treatment of Part-time Work 
and a longer course, equivalent in the number of 
working hours, if they devote only part of their 
working time to their studies. 
A school does not comply with the standards 
unless it complies with all of them and as to all 
its departments or courses. For example, an in- 
stitution maintaining both a day and a night 
school, one of which complies and the other does 
not, cannot be considered as complying. 
A part-time course of at least 160 weeks, cov- 
ering four school years, is the equivalent of a 
three-year, full-time course. This action is the 
same as that taken by the Association of Ameri- 
can Law Schools on the same problem. A school whose instruction is chiefly given 
after four p.m., or which regularly requires less 
than twelve hours a week of class work from its 
students, shall be considered a part-time school. 
A part-time school must maintain a curriculum 
which, in the opinion of the Executive Commit- 
tee, is the equivalent of that of a full-time school. 
The action of the Executive Committee under 
this subsection shall in each instance be reported 
to the Association at its next annual meeting and 
shall stand as the action of the Association until 
set aside by a vote of a majority of all the mem- 
bers of the Association. 
Any school now or hereafter a member of the 
Association, that conducts both full- and part- 
time curricula, must comply as regards each with 
the requirements therefor as set forth in the pre- 
ceding paragraphs. 
No school shall be or remain eligible to mem- 
bership if the institution of which it is a part shall 
through any other agency conduct instruction in 
law designed to prepare students for admission 
to the Bar or for Bar examinations, save in con- 
formity with the provisions of the preceding par- 
agraphs. 
Upon establishment of curricula in their part- 
time schools covering a period of at least 160 
weeks distributed over not less than four years, 
exclusive of holiday and vacation periods, and 
their compliance in other respects with the re- 
quirements [for membership, certain schools] will 
be eligible for membership, 
Library 
(c) It shall provide an adequate library available 
for the use of the students. It shall own a law library of not less than 5000 
volumes. 
Faculty 
(d) It shall have among its teachers a sufficient 
number giving their entire time to the school to 
ensure actual personal acquaintance and influ- 
ence with the whole student body. Its faculty shall consist of at least three in- 
structors who devote substantially all of their 
time to the work of the school.

  LEGAL EDUCATION 69 
In November, 1923, the Council first published the names of those law schools 
which it considered as then complying with the standards of the American Bar 
Association. A few months later, the list was revised, making the number at present 
forty-three out of a total of one hundred and sixty degree-conferring schools in con- 
tinental United States. Because of the developments described in the preceding pages, 
the list is almost entirely composed of those members of the Association of American 
Law Schools (out of a total of fifty-eight) that have not waited until September 1, 
1925, to require two college years for admission. After this date, the Council’s list 
bids fair to become substantially identical with the membership of the Law School 
Association. 
The particular institutions which now satisfy the requirements of one or both 
organizations are indicated in the complete List of Law Schools appearing in later 
pages of this Report. The table immediately following shows the relation of these 
two selected lists to one another, and their distribution among the six broad groups 
into which all the law schools of the country may be conveniently divided.

Among the changes that have occurred in the law schools during the past year, the 
following are the most noteworthy. The Universities of California and of Michi- 
gan have abandoned their alternative four-year courses. Creighton and Marquette 
have dropped their evening divisions. Of the full-time schools, the University of West 
Virginia has already increased its entrance requirements from one college year to two; 
several others have announced a similar increase effective next year, in order to meet 
the rules of the Association of American Law Schools; the University of Michigan 
and Cornell have announced a prospective requirement of a college degree, or three

college years in the case of those who take a “combined course”; Stanford will 
eventually require the degree of all entering law students. Several part-time and 
mixed schools have also increased their entrance requirements to an ostensible stand- 
ard of one or two college years, though it is by no means clear that, in all such cases, 
the equivalent of genuine college work is demanded. Eleven new schools have been 
_ added to the list: the full-time, high-entrance law department established this year 
by the University of Arkansas ; seven part-time law schools maintaining at least a 
three-year course;' and three two-year part-time schools.? 
The attendance figures show a striking increase since the War. Stated to the near-

The figure 36,100 for the entire academic year 1922-23 compares with an attend- 
ance, in the autumn of that year, of approximately 33,800. If the same percentage 
of increase was maintained, the complete figures for the year just terminated should 
be approximately 40,000. The great bulk of the increase (84 per cent of the total be- 
tween 1921-22 and 1922-23, 80 per cent of the total between the autumn of 1922 
and the autumn of 1929) is in part-time and “mixed” law schools. 
The increased attendance between the autumn of 1922 and the autumn of 1923, 
in forty full-time schools that have not recently changed their requirements, averaged 
something over eight per cent.

The following list of law schools is given in form similar to that employed in suc- 
cessive Annual Reports, beginning with that published in 1920. The conventional 
symbols attached to each school measure roughly the extent of its prima facie com- 
pliance with the three standards, affecting the amount of time devoted by students 
to their work, that have been formulated by the American Bar Association. That is 
to say, the roman numerals show the number of college years that are required for 
admission to regular standing as candidate for a degree, without regard to the im- 
portant complications produced by the admission of special students, etc., or of reg- 
ular students with entrance conditions. An asterisk means that a college degree is 
required for admission. The letter M (morning) denotes that classroom sessions pre- 
empt the best working hours of the day, and that therefore students are, or may be, 
required to devote to their studies all of their time not needed for necessary recrea- 
tion; while the letters A and E denote that classroom sessions are held at other hours, 
more generally convenient for self-supporting students. The arabic numerals show 
the duration of the law school course, in academic years or their equivalent. When 
separate divisions are conducted at different hours of the day, the requirements for 
each are stated in full, separated by commas. In all cases the symbols denote the re- 
quirements in force for those who entered the regular first-year class at the begin- 
ning of the autumn term of 1924. Announcements of subsequent changes, or courses 
continued for the benefit of students already enrolled, are not included. 
In parentheses, schools members of the Association of American Law Schools are 
marked (s); schools fully approved by the Council on Legal Education of the Ameri- 
can Bar Association are marked (c). 
The list is restricted to schools that confer first degrees in law, because of the prac- 
tical impossibility of drawing any other objective line between a “law school” and a 
fleeting “law class” conducted by one or more attorneys.

  80 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 
GerNERAL improvements in the field of dental education, which the Foundation’s 
study encouraged and which were mentioned in the last Annual Report, required 
unexpectedly so much further attention that it was impossible to complete the en- 
quiry and prepare the Bulletin pertaining to it before the close of the year. Twenty 
dental schools in the United States and three in Canada were revisited during the 
past academic year ; and forecasts of some of the findings of the study were formally 
presented and cordially received at an annual meeting of the American Dental As- 
sociation in Cleveland, on September 11, 1923, and again at the first annual meet- 
ing of the newly organized American Association of Dental Schools, in Chicago, on 
March 6, 1924, With the continued generous codperation of all the dental schools, 
and of the associations concerned directly with the progress of dental education, in 
Canada and the United States, the study has recently been completed and will soon 
be published. Some of its findings are indicated by the views and conclusions in the 
following sections. 
A. Dentistry a highly mechanical division of the healing art 
From the earliest periods of human history, the teeth have been subject to irregu- 
larity in arrangement, to decay and fragmentation, to loosening from their attach- 
ments in the jaws, and to partial or complete removal by accident or intent. Desire 
among the ancients for preservation of defective teeth, for fixation of loose teeth, and 
for esthetic restoration of lost parts of the visible dentition, initiated development of 
the art of dentistry, which has been traditionally a means of perfecting the mechanism 
of mastication, inducing oral comfort, correcting maxillary or palatal deformities, 
maintaining normal vocal enunciation, or enhancing facial comeliness. After centuries 
of cumulative refinement of its methods, the practice of dentistry has become, in the 
main, the art of realigning, repairing, rebuilding, and removing teeth; remedying dis- 
eased conditions within teeth and in tissues immediately adjacent to them; and re- 
placing, functionally and esthetically with artificial substitutes, the visible parts of 
extracted teeth. The last of these phases long seemed to be the most important utility 
of the practice of dentistry, which, by reason of its outstanding reconstructive charac- 
ter and its minor evidences of curative quality, appeared to be a specialty of applied 
mechanics with only an incidental relation to the art of healing. In recent years, den- 
tistry has also been aiming to repel disease through improvement of the resources of 
oral hygiene, chiefly by mechanical means. 
B. Dentistry now an independent and closely organized profession 
Dentistry began to assume an organized independence about eighty-five years ago, 
when the first journal of dentistry, the first national society of dentists, and the first
-P-A-G-E-93
THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 81 
dental school were established almost simultaneously in the United States. Before 
1868, however, there were practically no legal restrictions on the practice of dentistry 
in the United States or Canada; dentistry was regarded generally as a mechanical 
trade that any one might undertake who was disposed to do so, and its organization 
was superficial and comparatively ineffective. The six dental schools then existing 
graduated, in that year, only eighty-nine dentists, the great majority of those who 
aspired to practise dentistry in that period preferring to learn the trade as appren- 
tices in offices of established dentists. In 1868, in response to cumulative demands 
for greater degrees of assured responsibility and efficiency in dental service, the legis- 
latures of three states enacted laws that defined dentistry and specified educational 
requirements for a license to engage in its practice in the corresponding territory. 
This example was followed, during the period from 1878 to 1899, by the other states 
individually, and since 1900 such a law has been in force in every state in the Union. 
In all of the states in this country and the provinces of Canada, dentistry and 
medicine are regulated by law as independent though related professions. Admission 
to their practice is based on diverse educational requirements, which are exacted 
for each profession by state or provincial boards of examiners, or equivalent officers 
representing the people. The courts have interpreted these laws to mean that den- 
tistry and medicine are unlike in fact and in law, and that a dentist is not a phy- 
sician and a physician is not a dentist. 
Dentistry is now a highly organized profession, with about 60,000 practitioners 
in the United States and 3200 in Canada. In each there is a national association of 
dentists; and practically every state or province has.a state or provincial society and 
many district and local organizations of dental practitioners. There are forty-three 
dental schools in the United States and five in Canada. The state boards of dental 
examiners in this country have maintained a national association since 1883. Repre- 
sentatives of the dental schools in the United States and Canada have supported 
various general organizations of their teachers and schools since 1884, but are now 
united in the American Association of Dental Schools. The Dental Educational 
Council of America, representing three national organizations of state examiners, 
of schools and teachers, and of practitioners, respectively, performs for dentistry, in 
the United States, the functions that the Council on Medical Education and Hos- 
pitals of the American Medical Association does for medicine. The American Col- 
lege of Dentists is analogous to such medica] organizations as the American College of 
Surgeons and the American College of Physicians. The Fédération Dentaire Inter- 
nationale unites the practitioners of all nations, and will hold its next quinquennial 
congress in Philadelphia in 1926. The International Association for Dental Research 
consists of five research societies in this country and one in Canada. Many of the 
dental organizations issue periodicals, and a relatively large number of independent 
dental journals are published monthly. These dental associations have been con- 
ducted in complete independence of the medical organizations; and, owing to failure
-P-A-G-E-94
82 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
on both sides to recognize the fact that the primary objectives of dentistry and medi- 
cine are identical—to keep people well—there has been very little practical codp- 
eration between bodies representative of the two professions. Habit, not intelligence, 
has maintained this mutual disregard. 
C. Dentistry not an accredited specialty of the practice of medicine 
The abnormalities and diseases of such parts of the body as the eye, ear, nose, and 
throat are everywhere included in the practice of conventional medicine, and each 
is the primary concern of an important specialty of it; but in Canada and the United 
States, and also in other countries, the disorders of the teeth have been allotted to 
dentistry, which has been organized and is now legally defined and regulated as a divi- 
sion of the healing art that is intrinsically different from that of a specialty of medi- 
cine. The teeth and their closely adjacent tissues are the only parts of the body that 
have been generally singled out as a special domain of remedial treatment that may 
not be included in its entirety in the practice of medicine. 
The exceptional position of the art of dentistry, compared with the accredited 
specialties of the practice of medicine, has developed from early recognition of the 
unusually large proportion of direct manual labor and of the high degree of digital 
skill that were required in nearly every act in the realignment orreplacement of teeth, 
and in their reparative, remedial, or reconstructive treatment. The attainment of that 
special status has been due in large measure, also, to the abiding influence of the 
ancient and mistaken opinions among physicians, generally, that dental disorders 
usually were wholly local in extension ; were relatively unimportant in influence on 
the general health; and, therefore, occasioned medical attention only if and after 
adjacent parts had been involved or deranged so grossly as to necessitate treatment. 
These erroneous beliefs, which were promoted originally by physicians and which 
persist among them even now, have been fostered, also, by general misunderstanding 
of the significance of early medical observations that teeth were almost wholly de- 
void of the capacity for self-repair; that dental disorders were not curable with drugs 
but could be remedied by mechanical means alone; that all the teeth, whether healthy 
or diseased, could be broken off or extracted without serious lasting effects on the 
jaws or on the welfare of the body as a whole; and that substitutes for all of the 
visible parts of lost teeth could be mechanically fitted in the mouth for effective 
maintenance of the dental functions. The concurrence of these conditions of incapacity 
for self-repair, incurability by medicinal treatment, recovery from the effects of total 
loss, and completeness of functional restoration attainable by artificial substitution, 
which do not apply collectively to any other part of the body that is supplied with 
blood and nerves, seemed, in the superficial judgment of physicians, to justify medi- 
cal indifference to the teeth and to dentistry. 
As a result of these unfounded assumptions and of such misapprehensions of the
-P-A-G-E-95
THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 83 
import of dental disorders by physicians for centuries, medicine gave little attention 
to the health of the teeth. Although the advance of civilization has been accompanied 
by accentuation of dental abnormality, the desirability of careful enquiry in this field 
was persistently ignored by medicine; and, sharing the popular belief that decay of 
teeth was unpreventable and loss of teeth unavoidable, physicians helped to bring 
about universal resignation to the supposedly inevitable incidence of dental imper- 
fection and suffering. Until recently, medicine viewed this situation with about as 
much concern as that excited by loss of hair from the scalp, and did little more to 
understand or to control the influences responsible for the one than for the other. 
Under such conditions of indifference and neglect in the practice of medicine, which 
reflected the crudity, ignorance, and superstition of its development, the work of re- 
pairing and removing teeth, and of preparing and fitting substitutes for the visible 
parts of lost teeth, was considered to be as unimportant medically as that of a barber, 
and was left indifferently to those whose special mechanical proclivities induced them 
to undertake it. A tooth was “pulled” or broken off for the relief of toothache, and 
strength was the only operative requirement. Any one who could make “false” teeth 
was free to fit them in his own way, and under any mutually satisfactory conditions, 
into the mouth of any one to whom they could be sold. All but a few physicians 
refrained from rendering such service; and, consequently, goldsmiths, jewelers, ivory 
turners, umbrella makers, blacksmiths, mechanics, wig makers, tinkers, engravers, 
barbers, and itinerant jacks-of-all-trades, became the most numerous practitioners of 
dentistry, which remained a simple trade and a mechanical subsidiary to medicine 
until its leading practitioners, men of high ethical standards and enlightened endeavor, 
raised it during the last century to the status of a profession. 
After ignorance, commercialism, and charlatanry had lowered dentistry so far in 
public esteem that its most earnest practitioners in America were finally impelled to 
devise special measures to rescue it from its degradation, a few doctors of medicine, 
who had been concentrating their attention on dental disorders and who had a deeper 
appreciation than their medical confreres of the relation of the condition of the teeth 
and mouth to human welfare, codperated with a number of progressive dentists in 
efforts to elevate dentistry in public respect and to improve its quality by associat- 
ing it intimately with medicine. They endeavored, though unsuccessfully, to establish 
instruction in dentistry in schools of medicine, the most important of their proposals 
to this end having been rejected, by the faculty of medicine to which it was made, 
with the decisive comment that dentistry was not important enough to be included 
among the subjects of instruction in a medical school. 
This historic rebuff, administered in 1839, to earnest physicians and dentists who 
sought, in effect, to make dentistry a specialty of medicine, did not dishearten them, 
but did divert their purpose and threw them upon their own resources. With a vision 
of its greater respectability and its higher serviceability, they determined that, if den- 
tistry could not be taught in medical schools, it should be given a suitable educational  
-P-A-G-E-96
    84 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
foundation in independent colleges of dentistry. Accordingly, in 1840, they estab- 
lished the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. The first dental school began promptly 
to give instruction leading to the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.); 
graduated two students in 1841; and thus inaugurated formal dental education, 
which has been conducted in this country independently of medical education ever 
since, without objection from medicine and with little complaint from dentistry. 
The educational needs of dentistry were ignored by American universities and 
schools of medicine until 1867, when Harvard established a dental school in affilia- 
tion with its medical school. Oliver Wendell Holmes gave instruction in anatomy 
and physiology to the students of both schools. Now, thirty-three universities in the 
United States have schools of dentistry. 
The desirability of teaching the medical sciences to students of dentistry was ap- 
preciated by those who established the first dental school, and a degree of such in- 
struction has been given in dental schools ever since; but dentistry’s realization of its 
need for the medical sciences has never been keen enough to give to that instruction 
the quality it bears in medical education, or to impart to dentistry the character of 
a specialty of the practice of medicine. Growing need for laboratory facilities, to im- 
prove the instruction of dental students in the medical sciences, has induced adminis- 
trative officers, in most of the universities containing both medical and dental schools, 
to bring about affiliations between these schools in order to prevent avoidable waste 
from unnecessary duplication of teaching resources ; but such affiliations, which com- 
monly take the form of instruction of dental students in laboratories in the medical 
buildings, have not been expressive of any desire or tendency anywhere to make den- 
tistry a specialty of the practice of medicine. On the contrary, as a result of tradi- 
tional antagonism, these adjustments, having been effected in most instances under 
high degrees of resistance from the medical or dental faculties concerned, or both, 
continue to be more or less unwelcome to those collectively who objected to them 
in the first place. Medical faculties, as an outcome of this lack of understanding and 
accord, are often frankly indifferent to the conditions or quality of the instruction 
given in their laboratories to dental students. In turn, dental faculties, which usually 
have little more than a perfunctory interest in instruction in the medical sciences, 
make the best of such awkward situations, as guests of medical faculties, by submit- 
ting to what they cannot avoid. The burden of the public disservice from this state of 
affairs clearly rests upon the shoulders of the medical faculties concerned. 
Further indications of the uncompromising independence of dentistry and medi- 
cine, and also of indefensible neglect of public duty, are the facts that, although the 
medical schools in this country and Canada include instruction in the common fea- 
tures of such specialties of medical practice as oto-laryngology, rhinology, ophthal- 
mology, and dermatology, in the curricula prescribed for prospective general practi- 
tioners of medicine, these schools with few exceptions completely ignore clinical 
dentistry, as though it were wholly lacking in importance in the careful practice of 
 
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 85 
medicine. They disregard the relation of dental disorders to the inauguration and prog- 
ress of serious diseases in other parts of the body ; fail to emphasize even the general 
associations between dental disorders and those of the closely related medical special- 
ties named above ; make no provision for effective instruction in surgery on the border 
line between dentistry and medicine ; exclude practical dentistry from their dispen- 
saries and hospitals; and decline to recognize dental service in its true relation to 
human welfare. Even research in dental relationships is regarded, in important schools 
of medicine, as something intrinsically inferior. These deplorable conditions occur 
in universities where dental and medical schools are closely associated; but, despite 
the prevailing medical indifference to the import of clinical dentistry, many physi- 
cians, often against the protests of the dentists of the patients concerned, peremp- 
torily order extraction of particular teeth, or possibly of all remaining teeth, on the 
assumption, apparently, that a dentist’s judgment cannot be right when it conflicts 
with a physician’s guess. On the other side, however, it is also true that the biological 
ignorance of many dentists, owing to deficiency in their education in the medical 
sciences and in the requirements of oral health service, often mitigates the intolerance 
of physicians for the views of dentists in particular instances of seeming correlations 
between dental and extra-oral disorders, and frequently makes contributions by den- 
tists to consultations on health service patently unreliable. 
D. Dentistry properly a form of health service that should be made equivalent to that 
of an oral specialty of medicine 
Recent advances of science on the borderlines between medicine and dentistry, par- 
ticularly during the past fifteen years and especially from the contributions of pathol- 
ogy, bacteriology, and roentgenology, have shown that certain common and simple 
disorders of the teeth may involve prompt or insidious development of serious and 
possibly fatal ailments in other parts of the body. It has also been demonstrated that 
dental service, even when superficially perfect from purely mechanical and esthetic 
points of view, may hide or evolve local pathological conditions favorable to the 
onset of infectious disease elsewhere in the system, if and when that service disre- 
gards certain physiological requirements that neither dentistry nor medicine appre- 
ciated before the advent of recent discoveries. A discriminating attitude by indi- 
vidual physicians and dentists toward dental disorders, in the light of the earliest of 
these disclosures, led to the definite establishment of specific relationships between 
oral and systemic conditions, and has aroused belief in the existence of others await- 
ing detection. The reality of such significant correlations has emphasized the desira- 
bility of searching enquiry into their nature and into the extent of their occurrence, 
for the promotion of more accurate diagnosis and of more nearly perfect control, by 
both dentists and physicians, of numerous conditions of local or general disease. 
The import for dentistry and medicine of these significant findings on the border-
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
line between the two, and of the further discoveries they presage, is obvious. They 
force the conclusion that dentistry is an important mode of health service, and that, 
in general, its practice is quite as significant for the maintenance of health as that 
of the accredited specialties of medicine. Dentistry should no longer be ignored in 
medical schools, and its general health-service features should be given suitable atten- 
tion in the training of general practitioners of medicine. Antagonism between medi- 
cine and dentistry cannot be explained on any basis of public interest or advantage 
and has no justification in any sentiments that are worthy of respect, for both profes- 
sions are agencies for health service and cannot perform that service faithfully on 
any other conditions than those of earnest and effective codperation. The practice of 
dentistry should be made either an accredited specialty of the practice of conventional 
medicine, or fully equal, in grade of health service, to an oral specialty of medicine. 
There are two sides to the question raised by the alternatives in the last preceding 
statement. Against the desirability of a conversion of the practice of dentistry into an 
accredited specialty of the practice of conventional medicine are a number of impor- 
tant prevailing conditions. Neither organized medicine nor organized dentistry desires 
such a conversion or would be content with it. Since the dental and medical statutes 
in every state in this country, and in every province of Canada, oppose serious obsta- 
cles to it, the dental laws would have to be changed to permit it. Owing to the need 
for exceptional digital facility in the manifold intra-oral procedures of dental prac- 
tice, the extensive technical training and clinical instruction peculiar to it cannot be 
superimposed on a conventional medical curriculum, leading to the degree of M.D., 
without making the period of dental training prohibitive in length for most prospec- 
tive general practitioners. On the other hand, the medical curriculum is too rigid, and 
the views of medical state boards and of medical teachers are too unyielding, to permit 
substitution of training in the essential mechanical aspects of dentistry for anything 
now contained in the required parts of the undergraduate medical curriculum, al- 
though the inclusion of dental subjects among the prospective elective courses to be 
open to candidates for the M.D. degree would facilitate development of dental instruc- 
tion under the auspices of medicine. Unlike the practice of some specialties of medi- 
cine, such as that relating to disorders of the eyes by diagnostic and directive medi- 
cal specialists in ophthalmology (oculists), supplemented by modern optometrists 
as specialists in refraction and by opticians, the practice of health service applied to 
the teeth could not be divided properly among analogous stomatologists, dentists, 
and dental technicians. Such a distribution is unattainable because dentistry, in all 
its terminal manifestations, must be practised in the mouth of the patient, which can- 
not be done reliably without responsible comprehension of the import of the variable 
biological conditions involved and without adequate ability to perform the requisite 
intra-oral hand-work. 
In support of this statement it may be said that the details in an ophthalmolo- 
gist’s or an optometrist’s prescription for a pair of glasses can be obtained and trans-
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 87 
mitted with exceptional precision. On such a prescription, glasses can be made by 
machinery, by an optician, with relatively perfect accuracy, under standard and stable 
conditions, and the glasses can be fitted by an optometrist (or optician) by very simple 
superficial adjustments that may have considerable range of mechanical and biologi- 
cal variation without detriment to the patient’s eyes. In dentistry, however, the equiva- 
lent of an ophthalmologist’s (or optometrist’s) prescription cannot often be “obtained 
and transmitted with exceptional precision,” nor filled accurately by machinery; and 
the dental analogue of an optician’s glasses must be fitted as a rule with microscopic 
exactness to prevent accession of microorganisms into the substance of the tooth or 
teeth affected, and to avoid unnatural or undesirable contacts with or stresses upon the 
teeth involved or against which the appliance impinges. Anything to be placed in or 
upon the teeth, however well prepared it may be mechanically, rarely fits perfectly when 
first tested, but must be directly and often patiently adapted because of the individ- 
ual peculiarities and the inherent difficulties of the attending variable oral and opera- 
tive conditions. For this reason, therefore, an appliance made by a dental technician 
from a dentist’s models or specifications cannot be fitted by the technician or any one 
else as superficially as an optometrist (or optician) effectively adjusts a pair of glasses. 
On the contrary, it must usually be modified, and tested in place in the mouth, until 
it is a perfect fit, in accordance with all the complex anatomical, physiological, and 
esthetic requirements and the extreme degree of mechanical accuracy involved; and 
then must be skilfully put into place, and adjudged mechanically and biologically 
sound, and artistically satisfactory, by the “diagnostic and directive” practitioner of 
dentistry himself. A dental technician can prepare an appliance from a dentist’s models 
or specifications and, under a dentist’s supervision, can adaptively modify it; and, by 
attending codperatively to various ewtra-oral procedures, a technician can very effec- 
tively and desirably increase the amount of the direct personal intra-oral service of 
the dentist he assists; but without the education in the medical sciences that the 
practice of dentistry requires, the most competent dental technician, who with such 
additional training would be a dentist and not a technician, could not be safely en- 
trusted with the responsibility of fitting appliances into or upon teeth, and at present 
could not do so without violating the statutes that regulate the practice of dentistry 
in this country and in Canada. 
On the other side of the question raised above, it is clearly essential, from the point 
of view of public welfare, that, if dentistry cannot be made the health-service equiva- 
lent of an oral specialty of medicine within the scope of the practice of conventional 
medicine, it should be given that character in continued independence of conventional 
medicine, so far as organization is concerned. For the lay public, quality of health 
service rather than traditions or partisanships pertaining to such service is the pri- 
mary desideratum, and medicine or dentistry by any other name would be a service 
just as grateful. If dentistry, having been developed and established as an indepen- 
dent form of organized public service, can rise promptly to its opportunity to be-  
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
come the full health-service equivalent of an oral specialty of medicine, and will do 
so in good order and without economic waste, as it appears to be inclined to do, then 
few would welcome the needless embarrassments and demoralizations that would fol- 
low an attempt to destroy progressive dentistry by forcibly including it in conven- 
tional medicine. If, however, dentistry as now organized should not wish to become 
or could not develop into the full health-service equivalent of an oral specialty of med- 
icine, public interest would ultimately require the creation of an accredited specialty 
of medicine to render oral health service in conformity with all the evident necessities 
of such practice. 
It should be clearly realized that actualities rather than labels or symbols are the 
important factors in a consideration of this situation. It is helpful to recall in this 
relation that the term “medicine” is commonly used to signify not only the healing 
art in a general broad academic sense, but also to indicate particularly the practice of 
that part of the whole of the healing art that is commonly taught to those who receive 
the degree of M.D. “Healing art,” as a term, does not logically include the applica- 
tion of means of preventing the occurrence of disease or of maintaining health and nor- 
mality, but medicine and dentistry are employing such agencies with increasing effec- 
tiveness in the most desirable extension of their usefulness; nor does the “practice of 
medicine” include such factors in health conservation as dentistry, public-health ad- 
ministration, nursing, or pharmacy. By regarding the practice of these and also some 
minor types of activity for the maintenance of health or for the prevention or cure of 
disease, together with the practice of conventional medicine, as divisions or branches 
of health service instead of divisions or branches of “medicine,” one not only follows 
a logical and convenient course of reasoning, but also ignores the insignia of useless 
professional partisanships and obtains a clear suggestion of the proper position and 
due recognition of the practice of dentistry as it is, and also as it may be extended. 
The outstanding deficiency of the science of dentistry has been its inability, hith- 
erto, to lay the foundations for discovery of methods for the general prevention of decay 
of teeth and of diseases of the closely adjacent tissues. Discovery of means to these fun- 
damental ends would revolutionize the practice of dentistry by eliminating most of 
the occasion for it. Although these disorders are among the most commonly occurrent 
of all bodily ailments, medicine has ignored them; and dentistry, in her absorption 
in oral mechanics, has been helpless before them and, until recently, has been content 
to follow with repairs, reconstructions, and replacements. The primary causes of den- 
tal decay and of periodontal disease appear to be hidden in the biological secrets of 
the conditions or processes of dentition and nutrition, or of oral variability, or of all 
of them; and it seems probable that the causative influences, whether related to defec- 
tive dental development or impaired nutrition, or involved in particular conditions 
of dental environment, will not be discovered until the medical sciences are used effec- 
tively to that end. When dentistry becomes equivalentto an oral specialty of medicine, 
dental vision and effort, combined with biological understanding and aided with meth- 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 89 
ods of enquiry of corresponding adequacy, may be expected to bring these dental 
maladies into the realm of the completely preventable disorders, if that should not 
be inherently unattainable. Comprehensive and penetrating research in these rela- 
tionships is a basic need for the universal promotion of human welfare. 
E. Primary educational needs of dentistry as an equivalent of an oral specialty of the 
practice of medicine 
Development of the art of dentistry into the equivalent of an oral specialty of the 
practice of medicine would require a more comprehensive definition of dentistry, corre- 
sponding extension of the scope of dental health service, and commensurate improve- 
ment of dental education. Extended as it should be in biological scope and strength- 
ened in all its health-service aspects, dentistry, then a learned profession, would be 
devoted, in broad terms, 
(a) to establishment of the principles, and 
(6) to application of all forms and degrees, 
of scientific health service relating directly to the teeth and the closely adjacent 
oral tissues, and, indirectly through such service, to the welfare of other parts 
of the system and of the body as a whole; 
(c) to establishment of the principles of correlation between dental or oral condi- 
tions and systemic diseases, with particular reference to observed effects of the 
latter on the teeth and the closely adjacent oral tissues; 
(d) to detection, and provisional diagnosis, of dental or oral symptoms that indi- 
cate the prevalence or imply the probable existence of ill-health elsewhere in 
the body; and 
(e) to suitable, supplemental, advisory health service, including consultation with 
the patient’s physician, based on such observations (c) and diagnoses (d). 
In this view of an enlarged dentistry, its practitioners would be trained to give 
the service not only of dental surgeons and dental engineers as at present, but of 
oral sanitarians and oral physicians as well; and, instead of seeing only the teeth and 
mouth of a patient, as is now usually the case in a restricted view of their responsibili- 
ties, dentists would also suitably enquire into and keep careful records of the state of 
the patient’s health, particularly as it affects or is affected by conditions of the teeth 
and mouth; would plan their operations to meet not only the local requirements but 
also the possibilities of systemic consequences as well; would also recognize and note 
the significance of all outstanding symptoms of disease, and would warn or advise 
the patient accordingly, or explain his need for a physician’s attention; and could 
effectively discuss, with a physician, the oral condition of the patient in relation to 
his general welfare. The frequency with which dentists are, and will continue to be, 
consulted for oral health service gives to dentists particular opportunity and occa- 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
sion to note not only the occurrence of oral and systemic diseases, but also the exist- 
ence of correlations between them, and to help or guide patients accordingly. 
The type of training afforded by most of the dental schools does not promise to 
make the practice of dentistry the health-service equivalent of an oral specialty of 
the practice of medicine, and important improvements in dental education are re- 
quired generally for attainment of that objective. Appreciation by dental teachers 
of the necessity for thorough instruction in the mechanical aspects of the practice 
of dentistry has seldom been accompanied by due comprehension of the need for inti- 
mate understanding of the pathological involvements and of the health-service re- 
lationships of such practice. Instruction of dental students in the medical sciences, 
in most dental schools, has consequently been unwisely directed, indifferently given, 
and poorly assimilated; and the practice of dentistry has failed, from lack of know- 
ledge, ability, and vision, to measure up to its opportunity to be the health-service 
equivalent of an oral specialty of the practice of medicine. Dentistry is based on a 
degree of pre-professional education—graduation from a high school or its equiv- 
alent—that is too weak to sustain the mental load of effective training in the med- 
ical sciences, on which, with the mechanical sciences, the equivalent of an oral spe- 
cialty of medicine must be based. If the pre-dental educational requirement were raised 
to equality with that of the pre-medical—at least two years of appropriate work 
in an academic college—the necessary medical sciences and their applications could 
be taught to dental students as effectively as to students of medicine; and, if they 
were, current universal disparagement of dentistry as a practice that is intellectually 
and professionally inferior to that of medicine, and the attendant embarrassment of 
progress for dentistry, would be deprived of the facts on which they are based. 
To make the dental practitioner an expert in reparative and reconstructive pro- 
cedures—a good dental mechanic, in short—has been the paramount purpose of 
dental education, which has been primarily manual training. In the attainment of 
this important aim, a preliminary general education has been mistakenly regarded 
by dental leadership, with notable exceptions, as a subordinate qualification, which, 
while perhaps theoretically desirable, was practically unnecessary and apt, from the 
length of time required for its acquisition, to delay the beginning of dental study until 
a period in the age of the student when his capacity for active development in manual 
dexterity had become impaired or lost. Immaturity and ignorance, with hypothetically 
superior neuromuscular adaptability to digital training, have been preferred to rela- 
tive maturity and wisdom, with greater degrees of understanding and capacity. 
Owing to the prevalence of such distorted views, which have been a heritage from 
the days when dentistry was a mechanical trade, only twenty-two of the forty-three 
dental schools in this country required work in an academic college for admission in 
September, 1924, at least one year of such work having been first exacted effectually 
by fourteen schools in 1921, under the leadership of the Dental Faculties Association 
of American Universities. Very few practising dentists in the United States have been
-P-A-G-E-103
THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 91 
students in an academic college. Practically all of the graduates of dental schools in 
this country, including those of 1924, have been trained in institutions where the pro- 
fessional curricula were based on academic requirements ranging from nominal “pos- 
session of a good English education” to graduation from a high school. In 1925, 
however, all the graduates for that year from seventeen dental schools in this country, 
and, by 1928, the graduates of a majority of the schools, will have had at least one 
year of preliminary education in an academic college. This requirement for admis- 
sion will be exacted by all Class A dental schools, beginning in 1926; but it is possible 
that those of the Class B schools that may continue, after 1926, on a lower educational 
foundation, will have a majority of the whole number of dental students in this coun- 
try, and that most of the graduates in dentistry for several years after 1930 will not 
have had the advantages of any portion of an academic college education.1 
Medical education in this country has been based almost universally, since 1918, on 
an entrance requirement of at least two years of work in an academic college, including 
prescribed subjects of study, following graduation from a four-year high school. From 
present indications, it may safely be assumed that this pre-medical requirement will 
never be reduced in length. All of the reasons for the adoption and retention by medi- 
cine of this minimal pre-professional requirement, after a four-year trial of a require- 
ment of one year of work in an academic college, apply with equal force to early adop- 
tion of a two-year minimal requirement for dentistry as the oral division of health 
service, There is an additional reason: medicine, having tried the two-year require- 
ment, retains it because it has been found to be essential for all classes of practitioners 
of medicine. Since that degree of preliminary education is concededly desirable for 
such medical specialties as oto-laryngology, rhinology, ophthalmology, and dermatol- 
ogy, it must be equally desirable for dentistry as an analogous mode of health service. 
The foregoing views may be summarized in the general statement that dentistry 
is a highly mechanical division of the healing art, which has been closely organized 
independently of medicine; and, although not an accredited specialty of the latter, 
it is a division of health service, and should be extended in scope and improved suf- 
ficiently to make it equivalent to an oral specialty of the practice of medicine, either 
independently of medicine or as an accredited part of it. Among the important im- 
provements that such expansion and betterment will require, are deeper apprecia- 
tion among dentists and physicians of the health-service function of dentistry; more 
effective teaching of, and education in, the medical sciences and their application 
both to prevention and to treatment; and a degree of preliminary education that 
would be equal to the minimum required for medicine. 
Full attainment by dentistry of the character of an oral specialty of medicine ap- 
pears to depend, also, upon general reorganization of the system of dental education 
1 At a meeting in November, 1924, the Dental Educational Council voted to include a year of work in an academic college, for admission, among the minimum requirements for its Class A or Class B rating of dental schools, begin- ning in September, 1926, thus making it certain that by 1930 practically all graduates in dentistry will have had at 
least one year of education in an academic college. 
   
-P-A-G-E-104
  92 THE DIVISION OF EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRY 
on the basis of such readjustments and additions as these, which several of the best 
schools closely approximate in important respects: 
(a) Requirement of at least two years of suitable pre-professional work in an aca- 
demic college, including several courses that would stimulate interest and develop 
ability in, or reveal ineptitude for, the prospective practice of dentistry. 
(6) Reorganization of the undergraduate curriculum in dentistry into three aca- 
demic years instead of four, each lengthened, if necessary, to make that curriculum 
particularly effective for intensive and adapted training in the medical sciences, dental 
technology, clinical dentistry, and oral medicine, in preparation for the safe initia- 
tion, by the graduate, of competent general practice of dentistry. In this curriculum, 
the courses should be equal in quality to, and as far as possible interchangeable with, 
those in the corresponding subjects in the undergraduate curriculum in medicine; 
the degree of B.S. to be awarded at the end of the second dental year, or B.A. to 
students who completed three years of work in an academic college before admission ; 
and the professional degree, on graduation, to be that required for admission to the 
license examinations, which at present is D.D.S. or D.M.D. 
(c) Addition of elective, full-year, graduate curricula, based on the three-year under- 
graduate curriculum and conducted on a high plane of scholastic quality, for the 
systematic and intensive training of all types of dental specialists, teachers, and in- 
vestigators, with award of commensurate degrees, including M.A. or MLS. after at 
least one year of successful advanced work; and Ph.D. after at least two more years of 
such study and attainment in research. 
(d) Establishment of combined dental and medical curricula, with suitable dispen- 
sary and hospital facilities, for united medical and dental training of specialists in 
oral surgery, public-health service, medico-dental research, and other fields on the 
border lines between dentistry and medicine, with award of academic and professional 
degrees in accord with the types of study concluded and the achievement therein. 
(e) Provision of extension courses for practitioners, and of curricula for the proper 
training of oral hygienists and dental technicians. 
(f) Active promotion of research, now almost non-existent in the schools of den- 
tistry. 
(g) Development of adequate library facilities, now conspicuously absent from 
most dental schools. 
(A) Discontinuance of all independent dental schools or their conversion into 
schools for dental assistants, unless they should be sufficiently endowed, suitably af- 
filiated, and properly equipped to promote satisfactorily the teaching of modern 
dentistry, which cannot now be claimed for them. 
(a) Creation of additional dental schools in close affiliation with or as departments 
of schools of medicine in universities. 
Such advanced conditions could not be established without increased financial sup- 
port of dental education; but with adequate available resources the proposed im-
-P-A-G-E-105
THE STATUS OF DENTAL EDUCATION 93 
provements could and would be promptly effected by all of the important dental 
schools in this country and in Canada. A dental school cannot grow into the highest 
degree of educational quality, or into the greatest measure of humanitarian service- 
ability, from a financial soil consisting solely of the fees paid by students and pa- 
tients, as is now expected of most of the schools. Although dentistry is a mode of 
universal health service, the public has done little to advance it. Endowments for 
the effective maintenance of the best schools of dentistry, and for cumulative im- 
provement of their work, are urgently needed in the public interest. In this impor- 
tant respect dental education is identical with medical education; but, hitherto, in 
an era notable for the generous financial support deservedly accorded to medicine, 
the similar needs of dental health service have been almost wholly ignored. 
F. Important recent advances in the general status of dental education 
The Regents of the University of Michigan and the Trustees of Marquette Uni- 
versity have authorized their dental schools to require a minimum of two years of 
work in an academic college for admission, as soon as proper arrangements can be 
made; also to shorten the undergraduate curriculum to three years, and to establish 
full-year graduate curricula. Marquette instituted full-year graduate curricula at the 
opening of the present academic year, and will establish the new undergraduate cur- 
riculum in 1925. The dental schools of the University of Buffalo and McGill Uni- 
versity have joined those of Columbia University and the University of Montreal in 
requiring at least two years of work in an academic college for admission. In 1926, 
the dental schools of the University of Minnesota, Washington University, and the 
New York College of Dentistry, will exact the same degree of preliminary education. 
The minimum requirement in pre-professional study for the practice of dentistry in 
the Province of Quebec is now two years of work in an academic college; it will be the 
same in the State of New York after January 1, 1926. In 1925, the work of the School 
of Medicine and Dentistry of the University of Rochester will be initiated on a mini- 
mum of three years of pre-professional work in an academic college. 
The dental schools of the Universities of Cincinnati, Louisville, and Tennessee, and 
of Meharry Medical College, now require one year of work in an academic college for 
admission; in 1925, Cincinnati College of Dental Surgery, and the schools in Baylor, 
Georgetown, Temple, and Tulane Universities and in the University of Pittsburgh, 
all now on a high school foundation, will begin to require it; in 1926, it will be one of 
the Dental Educational Council’s minimum requirements for a Class A rating. Each 
of the five dental schools in Canada is now on that basis, or requires two years. 
Of the twenty-three Class A dental schools in the United States, fourteen now 
require at least one year of work in an academic college for admission; and of the 
twenty Class B, Class C, and unclassified schools, eight exact that minimum degree of 
pre-dental education.

  OPTIMISM IN EDUCATION 
Wuatever may be the weakness in our American system of education, there is sin- 
cere ground for the belief that our people will find their way to a system of schools that 
will make for good citizenship and that will promote a high quality of human life. 
The reason for this expectation lies in the deeply rooted faith of Americans in 
education. None of us may know precisely the type of school best suited for the train- 
ing of a democracy. We may be in doubt as to the studies that will most directly de- 
velop sound thinking. We may have exaggerated notions of the time and the money 
that ought to be spent in special forms of education. But, back of all our uncer- 
tainty, there lies deep in the conscience of the American people the conviction that 
in education lies the hope of the future. No people more sincerely believe in public 
education than Americans. For the education of their children they are ready to make 
great sacrifices, and if for a generation or two they offer up this devotion at the altar 
of a mistaken ideal, nevertheless the devotion is sincere. In time this spirit will go far 
to help the people themselves to find their way to a conception of education that shall 
be disciplinary yet generous; whose fruitage will be the development of those forms 
of schools that make for sound training and for true culture. If one could not believe 
this, his anticipations for the future of democracy would be dark. But no one can come 
closely in contact with the schools of English-speaking North America, in the United 
States and the Dominion of Canada, without a firm conviction that the inherent de- 
sire for education and the sound common sense of this people will in time find their 
way to a system of schools which will serve for the development both of intelligence 
and of character. The widespread discontents touching the weaknesses and the mis- 
takes of the past years are themselves indicative of a sound attitude. Slowly, but none 
the less surely, we will as a people turn our faces toward an ideal of education which 
rests upon simplicity, sincerity, and thoroughness. To face in this direction is the 
beginning of true progress. 
THE FUTILITY OF FAULT-FINDING 
Pustic opinion throughout the world to-day is critical and restless. Itwould be strange 
if this were not true in Europe, whose governmental and social machinery has gone 
through the stress of the greatest war the race has ever known. But this attitude of 
mind is quite evident in countries like the United States, where the strain of the war 
was negligible in comparison with that which the European nations were called upon 
to endure. This country is prosperous. Equality of opportunity for all men is as fully 
secured as in any nation at any time in the world’s history. The power to control the 
government rests in the hands of the whole people. Nevertheless, here also public 
opinion is restless and critical. How much of this railing against the social order is 
justified and how much is artificial; how much is due to the prevailing unrest of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
day and how much to the active propaganda of doctrinaires and special groups, it 
would be difficult to say. Few people can resist the tendency to be discontented if they 
are persistently told they ought to be. Whatever the answer, the fact remains that the 
machinery of our social order is under fire. The three great organizations of society are 
those of government, of religion, and of education. The attack on these varies all the 
way from sober criticism to the revolutionary effort to overturn and destroy them and, 
to re-create society upon a new basis. Thoughtful and well-meaning men are confused 
by the variety of charges and the intensity of the feeling evidenced by first one group 
and then another. Men whose lives are prosperous and contented find themselves, they 
know not how, drawn into a state of mind in which they are suspicious of the exist- 
ing institutions, anxious for some change, and ready to lend an ear to almost any in- 
dictment against the government, the church, or the public system of education. 
In such a state of the public mind it is cowardly to resort to captious criticism. 
On the other hand, it is futile to ignore the counter currents of public opinion and 
to discuss education as if the world were concerned only with details. What matters 
to-day is not so much details, whether of government, of religion, or of education, 
but rather to apprehend and to satisfy public opinion with respect to those funda- 
mental ideals of social life upon which our progress depends. It is the clear percep- 
tion of elementary facts and truths that alone can determine the course we ought 
to follow. In the absence of such vision, communities and nations are borne upon 
deep unseen currents, they know not whither. To perceive and to make clear these 
fundamental ideals is the part of constructive statesmanship alike in politics, in 
religion, and in education. 
WHAT IS PROGRESS? 
Tue appeal most constantly on the lips of those who seek to lead, is voiced in the word 
“progressive.” Every faction that bids for leadership begins with the claim that it is pro- 
gressive. The faction that can show the highest speed is of course the most progressive. 
The essential question concerning which mankind desires to be:satisfied relates not 
so much to the speed at which it may travel as to the direction in which it is going 
and the destination at which it expects to arrive. Are there fundamental truths from 
which one must start ? Does progress mean advancement along a course determined 
with regard to these truths and principles of human action? Or does it mean a 
plunge into an unknown wilderness under the urge of haste and speed? Has the his- 
tory of mankind, as we know it, furnished a starting-point and indicated the direction 
for future progress? In a word, what is progress in the sense of a steady advance in the 
durable happiness and peace of the world? To satisfy the restless, querulous, half- 
angry spirit of to-day, an answer must be found to these questions. 
In the endeavor to get a starting-point one must bear in mind a few lessons of 
human experience upon which all men can probably agree.
-P-A-G-E-111
  THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 99 
In the first place, mere change is not necessarily progress. Wandering over the fields 
does not usually bring one anywhither. Joy-riding, at the best, brings one to no sure 
journey’s end, and at the worst lands those who employ it, as a means of progress, in 
the ditch. 
It is well to recognize at the outset that progress begins from some definite basis 
of truth rooted in experience and reason. It does not begin in no man’s land. 
Furthermore, progress depends rather on the direction one takes than on the speed 
at which he travels. If he is headed the wrong way, the more “ progressive” he is, the 
greater his distance from the hoped-for destination, and the more difficulty he will 
experience in getting on the right path. All sincere and thoughtful men desire prog- 
ress and all such men believe themselves to be progressive. To denounce those who 
differ from us as reactionaries is a childish performance. But one may well ask, and 
most of all in the field of public education, that those who undertake the education 
of the nation shall have a definite comprehension of the vantage ground from which 
they start, and clear vision of the direction in which progress is to be made. The 
least a thoughtful progressive can do is to make clear the point from which he starts 
and the direction in which he proposes to travel. The progressive urge is magnificent, 
provided one is going in the right direction. The homely words of Davy-Crockett 
are applicable to-day, “First be sure you are right, then go ahead.” To be sure one 
is right means study, patience, hard work. Not every one who calls himself a pro- 
gressive is willing to pay that necessary price. 
THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
In education, no less than in other great fields of human thought and action, man- 
kind is more concerned with the direction than with the speed of its progress. In 
organized public education in the United States, an enormous advance has been 
made in the period since our civil war. To have some clear conception of what has 
been accomplished in this period, in terms of intellectual and moral values, is the 
starting-point for progress in the future. What did our system of public education 
undertake fifty years ago, and what fulfilment does it present to-day? And what 
course for future progress does this history suggest? 
One needs to bear in mind that the system of public schools in the United States 
did not come into existence by a logical progress— first the elementary school, then 
the high school, and later the college and university. The process was almost the in- 
verse of this. Universal education through a system of popular schools is the distinct 
achievement of modern democracy. The university, on the other hand, is the child 
of the middle ages, the offspring of the revival of learning. The name itself had no 
relation to the notion of a universe or to universality of learning. It denoted merely 
the totality of a group, whether the group were made up of carpenters, barbers, or 
students. A fair translation of the medieval term university would be rendered by 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
the American slang phrase “The gang ’s all here.” It signified the totality of the 
group of teachers and students. 
In both Europe and America, therefore, some adjustment had to be effected be- 
tween the common schools instituted for universal education and the already exist- 
ing universities. No small part of the difficulties and perplexities of educational prog- 
ress has arisen in the effort to adjust the democratic system of common schools to 
the older institutions of higher learning. 
In the American colonies, the institutions of higher learning naturally followed the 
precedent of the English colleges at Cambridge and Oxford. Harvard in Massachu- 
setts, and William and Mary in Virginia, were both in existence before the begin- 
ning of the eighteenth century. 
Early in the history of the colonies, schools for the common people were also begun. 
They were not related to the colleges, nor were they intended to prepare for them. 
The movement began in New England. In 1647, Massachusetts enacted a law that re- 
quired every town of fifty householders to establish a school — an epoch-making ordi- 
nance, and the real beginning of our public school system, not only in Massachusetts, 
but in the nation. While there is no mention of education in the Constitution of the 
United States, the founders of the nation were keenly alive to the importance of popu- 
lar schools. They believed that every citizen should have a certain measure of edu- 
cation in order that he might intelligently discharge the duties of citizenship. They 
considered, however, that the obligation and the cost for the maintenance of schools 
should fall upon the several states. To assist the states in fulfilling this obligation, 
there was passed the ordinance of 1787, and other acts setting aside one thirty- 
sixth of the whole Northwest Territory for the use of communities in the establish- 
ment and maintenance of public schools. 
The ideal offered in these common schools, as the basis of a liberal education, did 
not go very far. It provided that every child should learn reading, writing, and arith- 
metic, but as President Hadley has admirably pointed out in his Economic Problems 
of Democracy, it went straight toward the mark. “It did not undertake to give much 
knowledge of politics or economics; it left that to be acquired afterward, in the jury 
box or the political campaign, from the newspaper or the counting-room. For this it 
taught them to rely on themselves.” 
The results obtained from these elementary schools, with their simple and meagre 
courses of study, constitute the most satisfactory achievement of the American public 
school system. The initiative, and the ability to think for himself, manifested by the 
typical American of the first half of the nineteenth century, are due in large measure 
to them. They, more than any other one agency, successfully transformed an enormous 
flood of immigrants into patriotic American citizens. 
Our system of public education, therefore, until after the close of the civil war, 
was made up of the common schools (district schools, they were called in the middle 
west), and of a number of colleges representing the higher learning. They had been
-P-A-G-E-113
  THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 101 
established to serve different purposes, and did not articulate. Each type of institu- 
tion was free to serve the aim for which it had been instituted. 
This was the starting-point for the development of our present day educational 
system, whose growth can be indicated in broad terms in a few words. 
The courses of study in both the common schools and the colleges, up to the early 
seventies, were dominated by the classical tradition handed down from the univer- 
sities of the middle ages. During the revival of learning, men’s thoughts were mainly 
engaged with questions of the spiritual and the unseen. The scholars, to whom we 
owe the first universities, turned to the classical traditions as the only source from 
which their intellectual hunger could be satisfied. Science, in the modern sense, had 
been forgot since Aristotle. Mathematics was the one exact science. But even simple 
operations in arithmetic were matters of great difficulty. The arabic numerals were 
not introduced into Europe until the twelfth century. Any one who will undertake 
to carry out a simple multiplication with Roman numerals will understand the diffi- 
culties of teaching arithmetic to medieval students. Reading, writing, and arithmetic 
for the common schools, and Latin, Greek, mathematics, and English literature for 
the colleges, formed the basis of education in the two groups of schools until after the 
civil war period. 
Two influences played a leading part in the rapid transformation that began imme- 
diately thereafter. The first was the desire for a higher type of tax-supported school 
open to the great body of children and youth. The other was the growing influence of 
science upon human thought and the demand for a larger place for scientific studies 
in public education. 
Two results of great significance followed. The high school became an accepted 
part of the public school system. Originally it was called the people’s college. It was 
intended to provide a liberal education, at public expense, for the great body of youth 
who lacked either the means or the inclination to go to college, or who desired what 
was thought to be a more practical education. The second came in the rapid modifica- 
tion of the old curriculum with the introduction of scientific courses of study and the 
necessary facilities of laboratories and libraries. This affected both the high school and 
the college. The outcome was modified by various collateral influences, such as the rise 
of normal schools, schools of applied science, and the elective system. But the transform- 
ing forces that made over our whole system of public instruction were the demand of 
democracy for a higher education for all the people, coincident with the sweeping mod- 
ification of the traditional curriculum by the inclusion of scientific studies: not only 
the physical sciences such as chemistry, physics, geology, and biology, but also psy- 
chology, sociology, economics, and the science of government. It was inevitable that the 
high school, in the process, should become related to, and articulated with, the college. 
The college, in the meantime, was itself subjected to a new strain. European uni- 
versities offered a type of professional training and education, in medicine, in law, 
and in advanced study in literature and science, beyond that offered in this coun-
-P-A-G-E-114
102 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
try. Johns Hopkins University, which opened its doors to students in 1875, repre- 
sented this ideal of advanced professional study. Its establishment had a profound 
effect upon the existing institutions of higher learning. The practical result was to 
superpose the university upon the college — originally planned to be our highest 
institution of liberal education—and to place the college upon the high school — ori- 
ginally planned to render a distinctive service in higher education of a type different 
from that offered by the college. The outcome is a system of public education made 
up of an elementary school, demanding the attendance of a child from his sixth to 
his fourteenth year; a secondary school for liberal education of the youth between 
fourteen and eighteen; a college for continued liberal education from eighteen to 
twenty-two; and a university for professional study from twenty-two to twenty-five 
or twenty-six, depending upon the profession to be followed. In the medical course, 
for example, two years of hospital interneship follow graduation. The man who enters 
medical practice through the full program will be between twenty-eight and thirty 
before beginning the practice of his profession. 
The four types of schools originally designed to serve specific needs in education 
have become closely articulated parts of a system. The high school is a vestibule to 
the college and the college a passageway from the high school to the university. 
Between the college and the university there is a certain amount of overlapping. 
The college did not surrender all its territory to the university. Many students pass 
to the university at the end of their second year in college, and a joint arrange- 
ment has been worked out in many institutions touching the adjustment of college 
and university degrees. The practical outcome is, that partly out of the process by 
which the high school has been put under the college and the university has been super- 
posed upon it, we have four sections in our articulated educational system. To com- 
plete them all upon a typical program requires a longer time than is demanded in 
any other civilized country. In Europe, the system of liberal education includes an 
elementary school and a secondary school, ending at the age of eighteen or nineteen. 
From the secondary school the youth enters the university some three years younger 
than the American who graduates from a college. Nothing could justify a national 
program of formal education so time-consuming, which subordinates one type of 
school so completely to another as does ours, except extraordinary results in the cul- 
tural and vocational education of all groups of our citizenship. 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF FIFTY YEARS OF PROGRESS 
Tue results of our last half-century’s progress in organized education are in many 
respects notable. 
Perhaps the greatest single attainment is the widespread opportunity for educa- 
tion afforded to the children and to the youth of the whole nation. There still remains 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  ACHIEVEMENTS OF FIFTY YEARS OF PROGRESS 103 
a certain remnant of illiteracy, as there does in every European nation, but the school 
door stands open to every child, and on the whole the American people is the most 
widely educated people in the world. 
Perhaps the second notable achievement following the introduction of science 
into the curriculum lies in the fact that the higher institutions, including high school, 
college, and university, appeal no longer to certain groups, but to the whole body of 
the people. Great numbers in the body politic that found no appeal to enter a high 
school or a college devoted to classical studies find innumerable opportunities for 
intellectual training in the new subjects that science has brought in. Not alone 
physical sciences but the sciences of social organization and of human behavior have 
served to open new doors to knowledge and to training that appeal to those who 
desire intellectual advancement whatever the social background may be. Fifty years 
ago, the high schools and the colleges found it difficult to fill their classrooms. To-day, 
they are overrun by more applicants than they can admit. The broadening of the 
course of study has brought higher education to the doors of the whole people, and 
this is a great achievement. 
The introduction of laboratory methods in the teaching of science has provided a 
notable incentive to intellectual activity, and has broadened the appeal that formal 
education makes to the great body of citizens. Along with this development there has 
come stimulation of scientific research which has not only quickened the intellectual 
tendencies of our people but has turned to public service the methods and results of 
science. The development of instruction in public health and of the public-health 
services to the community is one of the most notable achievements of our time, and 
is due in large measure to the development of scientific studies in the schools and 
colleges. 
This period has seen likewise an earnest and far-reaching effort to develop agencies 
for the training of teachers, and for the development of the science of teaching. These 
agencies for the training of teachers and for the promotion of the science of teach- 
ing cannot fail to have, in time, a marked effect in the creation of a body of able 
teachers. 
In a word, the advance of the last fifty years shows magnificent results in broad- 
ening the means of culture and of training; in bringing the scientific subjects into 
the curricula; in making education available and attractive to vast numbers who be- 
fore had no inclination toward a higher education. It has provided laboratories and 
library facilities for study such as the world never before has known. Of recent years 
the higher institutions are going still further and are providing for adults the oppor- 
tunities for higher education. 
All these achievements taken together make a notable advance. Our curriculum 
in elementary school, high school, college, and university, as compared with the 
meagre program of fifty years ago, suggests the difference between a rich banquet 
of wealth and the meagre dinner of poverty. Any member of the body politic may 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
    104 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
find in the offering of to-day’s education something to appeal to his imagination, or 
to his desire for knowledge, or to his sense of service to the community and to the 
nation. Along with this enrichment of our means of instruction there has come a 
generous support from communities and from individuals, and while some portions 
of ourcountry still lack suitable buildings and suitable equipment, the improvement 
in the structures in which our schools are housed fitly represents the breadth and the 
diversity of the courses themselves. 
All of this marks a notable advance in comparison with the system of schools and 
colleges by which education was served in the seventies. 
SOME BY-PRODUCTS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
Nor infrequently the by-products of social machinery, like those of industrial en- 
terprises, assume great significance. This has been true of organized education. To 
add to the courses of study the great subjects of modern science ; to replace didactic 
lectures in chemistry and physics with laboratory courses; to bring science to its 
just recognition as a means both of technical training and of human culture; to mul- 
tiply the opportunities for education so as to appeal to all sorts and conditions of 
youth; these are splendid achievements of educational development. They belong, 
however, rather to the quantitative than to the qualitative side of progress, and the 
process has resulted in some unexpected complications that deserve the most careful 
study. 
The greatest and oldest human organizations of society have made their mistakes 
not through undertaking too little but too much. The agencies of government, not 
content to confine their duties to governing, often seek to administer the details of 
community life that are best left to the individual. In the process, the distinction 
between government andadministration is forgot. TheChristian church, after a period 
of the most wonderful religious activity mankind has ever experienced, took into its 
hands the reins of civil government. In the process, the essential purpose for which 
the church existed was well-nigh forgot. 
This is indeed the most important lesson that the history of the two older agen- 
cies of society —government and the church— discloses for the guidance of organ- 
ized education—a relatively new agency in the social order, the daughter of modern 
democracy. The school is primarily an intellectual agency. It will serve society best 
if it keeps always in mind this primary obligation. The school system that dissipates 
its energy in the endeavor to compass all manner of social activities will in time 
forget or neglect the primary intellectual purpose for which it exists. 
The most profound change that has affected our public education in our fifty years 
of rapid advancement is one of which we seldom think. The currents that transform 
human institutions are not always on the surface. 
This change lies in the practical substitution of a new ideal of the meaning of a
-P-A-G-E-117
SOME BY-PRODUCTS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 105 
liberal education. The curriculum of the old time common school was meagre, the 
classical program of studies in the colleges of fifty years ago was narrow, but they 
both stood for the conception that a liberal education lay in training the habits and 
powers of the mind. In the enormous expansion of the course of study, in making the 
high school a vestibule to the college, in adding ever new activities that now over- 
shadow the intellectual purposes of high school and college, Americans have come 
to look upon a liberal education as the acquiring of knowledge. To learn to observe, 
to marshal the facts of observation, and to think out the correct answers to be drawn 
from these facts, constitute the foundation of a liberal education. 
The school exists in order to train the minds of children and youth for this pro- 
cess. The acquiring of knowledge is altogether a secondary matter. It has become the 
main thing. Our high schools and colleges seek to give their pupils something from 
every field of thought. Following the advice of Herbert Spencer, they labor to pre- 
sent these packages of knowledge in the most agreeable forms. The text-books offer 
every variety of pre-digested knowledge. Our youth are spoon-fed as are those of no 
other nation. Breadth of knowledge is obtained at the expense of independent indi- 
vidual training in finding the facts, sifting them, and drawing accurate conclusions. 
The method makes for intellectual dependence. “The boy who has become accustomed 
to depend on the teacher for his knowledge in school tends to take his knowledge sec- 
ond hand in after life. The boy who can study only what he likes in school is gov- 
erned in after life by his likes and dislikes rather than by his reason.”! 
This is the far-reaching change that has come to be characteristic of our educa- 
tional system of to-day. It is exactly the reverse of that intellectual training which 
the study of science ought to bring. To get the facts, to put them in logical order, 
to deduce the reasonable conclusions therefrom, constitute the essential part of the 
scientific method. In our teaching we have obscured the method of science in the pro- 
cess of filling the minds of children and youth with information put up in pleasing 
packages. 
To recognize once more that a liberal education does not consist in imparting 
knowledge but in training the habits and powers of the mind must be the beginning 
of any freshening of our school system. 
Another complication, the outcome of the inevitable movement to articulate the 
parts of our educational system, is to be found in the subservience of the secondary 
school to the college. Originally intended to furnish a liberal education to those who 
could not, or did not desire to go to college, the public high school has come under 
the complete domination of the college. Its courses, and its teaching, are in the main 
planned, not so much to educate its pupils, as to enable the minority that desire to 
enter college to pass the requirements for college entrance. In its desire to find a dis- 
tinctive field, the public high school has included a program of vocational studies, 
aimed mainly to enable youths of both sexes to gain entrance to certain vocations, 
1 Hadley, Economic Problems of Democracy, p. 154.
-P-A-G-E-118
    106 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
such as stenography, secretarial service, bond-selling, or insurance solicitation. Between 
these two tendencies, the public high school has to a considerable extent lost sight 
of its original ideal as a people’s college, intended to serve as a school of liberal edu- 
cation for the whole people. Secondary schools that are not tax supported are frankly 
vestibules to college. They exist, not so much to educate boys and girls, as to enable 
them to jump the hurdles that must be cleared to get into college. 
Again, the high school when it was the people’s college, and the American college 
of a generation ago, conceived of themselves as intellectual agencies. The life was one 
of study and of fellowship between teacher and pupils in matters of the mind. Such 
activities as lay outside of the classroom —debates, oratorical contests, prize essays — 
partook of the intellectual life. 
To-day the outside activities in the college overshadow and run counter to the in- 
tellectual life. Athletics, in large measure professional in its methods and organiza- 
tion, fills a larger place in the eyes of students and even of the public than any other 
one interest. No scholar in the undergraduate life of one of our university-colleges 
would expect to receive the recognition or appreciation given to a successful football 
player. A dozen other new activities call for the time and energy of the students. The 
college is no longer distinctively an intellectual agency. 
The public high school has naturally borrowed these features from the college. It 
too has become a school in which the extra-mural activities, and particularly com- 
petitive athletics, obscure intellectual interests. 
No reasonable man will object to the employment of these activities—for exam- 
ple, athletics—in their due perspective. But when they are allowed to dominate the 
intellectual life of the colleges they become abuses. The paid coach, the professional 
organization of college athletics, the demoralization of students by participation in 
the use of extravagant sums of money, constitute a reproach to American colleges, 
and to those who govern them. Oxford and Cambridge have shown the way to make 
athletics minister to the physical training of the whole body of students without dis- 
placing scholarship. There is not a paid coach in an Oxford or Cambridge college; no 
gate receipts; no solicitation on the part of graduates to gather in promising athletes. 
Athletics in English colleges is on a basis such as students can themselves develop, 
and still be scholars. In the American college athletics is on a professional basis. In 
this matter the college has corrupted the high school. 
Finally, we have developed an educational structure, embracing elementary school, 
high school, college, and university, which covers a longer period of the life of the in- 
dividual than is contemplated in the school system of any other country. Yet we lack 
many of the schools for technical training that play so large a part in the industrial 
and social life of European nations. We have indeed a number of engineering schools 
for the training of professional men in various branches of engineering and applied 
science, but we have few schools designed to serve those who wish to acquire techni- 
cal skill in industry and in commerce. Even where such schools have been started, there
-P-A-G-E-119
THE STRATEGIC PLACE OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL = 107 
is a strong tendency to transform them into schools for training for the professions. 
Schools for the mechanical trades, for example, become colleges of technology. 
In Europe the youth who desires to make a career in commerce enters a school in 
which he not only studies the economic side of business, but he learns to speak the lan- 
guages of the region in which he expects to serve. We are more disposed to place a 
school of business administration (a somewhat ambiguous term) on top of the college. 
Few of those who attend these schools can speak a foreign language, many of them 
write and speak their mother tongue indifferently. 
In a word, our school system as it has grown up, generous as it is in providing 
information, has unconsciously accepted an ideal of liberal education based on the 
absorption of knowledge rather than on the training of the mind; in the process of 
articulating the parts of our educational system an undue subservience of one part 
to another, notably of the secondary school to the college, has inadvertently resulted; 
some parts of our system, notably the college and the secondary school, have allowed 
interests other than intellectual to play too large a part; finally, we have a school 
system in which, as it is planned, a larger part of the life of the individual is to be 
spent in the schools than is contemplated in any other country, yet it lacks schools 
to train an adequate number of men and women in the technical skill so widely needed 
in the world, and in the exercise of which a large part of humanity finds its livelihood 
and its happiness. 
To examine this situation wisely is better worth while than to add new ine 
to our wide-flung courses of study. 
THE STRATEGIC PLACE OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Tux secondary school is to-day the determining part of our four-story educational 
structure. Its original aim—a school of liberal education for the whole people—has 
been subordinated to the need to serve as a passageway to the college. Through its 
entrance requirements, the college dominates the educational program of the high 
school. 
Even so, the situation is far from satisfactory to the colleges and professional 
schools. They admit each year a growing army of high school graduates who lack the 
qualities of intellectual training which would fit them for fruitful college study. They 
have indeed complied with the formal college requirements for admission, but they 
have not learned to use their minds. A large number of the unfit are eliminated in 
their freshman year, a process neither wholesome for the college nor just to those thus 
summarily dismissed. 
The consequences of this weakness extend to the graduate and professional schools. 
The medical school and the law school find their greatest embarrassment in the lack 
of thinking ability among the high school and college graduates. 
In the newly organized German Republic there has been some illuminating dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  108 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
cussion over the matter of adaptation of public education to a democracy. Those, 
including socialists, who advocate a wider admission to their universities have made 
clear that they do not intend to make easier the admission of the unfit. They do not 
desire their universities “Americanized,” by which they mean such a lowering of 
intellectual standards as would admit those who are unprepared to undertake serious 
intellectual work. 
That the tax-supported secondary school should form the basis of entrance to the 
tax-supported college was inevitable and necessary. It was equally clear that the 
endowed colleges—which are none the less public institutions—should relate their 
entrance conditions to the work of the tax-supported secondary school. The mistake 
was not in this articulation, but in the methods which the college has adopted for the 
admission of students. These are completely in the hands of the colleges, notwithstand- 
ing the fact that during recent years college entrance requirements (whether by exam- 
ination or by certificate) have been matters of conference between the associations of 
colleges and of preparatory schools. The results of the methods of admission in use up 
to the present time have been unfortunate for the secondary school. It has in large 
measure lost its freedom of action as a school of liberal education, and yet has sent 
into the college great numbers of graduates lacking the primary requirement for the 
intellectual life. There is no duty more directly resting upon the American college 
to-day than that of framing its entrance requirements in such fashion as to secure fit 
preparation for its own work, and at the same time to leave to the secondary school a 
large measure of freedom to do its distinctive work of liberal education. 
The intelligent layman in education may well ask, and is asking with increasing 
emphasis, why does a college, least of all an old and famous college, admit to its stu- 
dent body youths unable to comply with the elementary requirement to spell cor- 
rectly and to write good idiomatic English? Or, why does a great tax-supported uni- 
versity admit to its undergraduate classes hundreds of unfit youths of both sexes only 
to cast them out at the end of the first half year? 
To answer these questions fully would be to analyze the whole process of organi- 
zation of higher education in the United States. The situation, as it stands, is the 
result of many factors. The college authorities have naturally thought primarily of 
their own requirements. They have not always remembered that a secondary school 
system that failed to train the minds of its students meant necessarily a college mem- 
bership ill prepared for a vigorous intellectual life. We all have a naive faith in exam- 
inations, very much as we are disposed to consider that a statute voted by Congress 
means the accomplishment of a reform. To prepare an examination paper that is fair, 
discriminating, and adapted to test pupils who are studying under many masters, is 
a work of the highest wisdom. 
In addition, our colleges, at least until recently, have been fierce competitors for 
numbers. Tax-supported institutions have rested their appeal to the legislatures on 
the ground that the state institution took care of everybody. The practical result has
-P-A-G-E-121
  THE STRATEGIC PLACE OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL 109 
been the admission of both the fit and the unfit and a corresponding lowering of the 
plane of intellectual life. 
The future of public education depends chiefly on these institutions, the high school, 
the college, and the university, and the conditions that will make for educational sin- 
cerity and for educational freedom. There is no duty resting upon college teachers of 
to-day, so important as the recasting of the college method of admission. Fortunately, 
the interests of the secondary school and the college lie along the same path. 
It is clear that neither the method of admission by certificate nor that of admis- 
sion by examination has been satisfactory, not entirely on account of inherent weak- 
ness in either, but because it has been humanly impossible to use either in an impar- 
tial way. A system of examination that waits until the completion of the secondary 
school to test the performance of its pupils is too late to be of service to the youth in 
his high school course. On the other hand, admission entirely by certificate puts upon 
the high school teacher the entire responsibility for sifting the fit from the unfit, and 
subjects him to a pressure that he is often unable to resist. A way must be found to 
bring pupils face to face with sharp tests in a few fundamental subjects, while leay- 
ing the secondary school free to give its full service to the work of liberal education 
of the great mass of its students who never enter college. It is no longer tolerable, 
nor is it necessary, to make the educational function of the high school secondary to 
its service as a fitting school for college. 
The remedy for the situation is not entirely simple and cannot be compassed with- 
out patience and discrimination on the part of those who are responsible both for 
the secondary school and for the college. The way to a sound adjustment is indicated 
in the experience of European systems of education. 
The one sure way of progress is to follow the path of intellectual sincerity and to 
go only so far and so fast as we can go with certainty. The real indictment of pres- 
ent day conditions is their insincerity. The present college entrance requirements pur- 
port to furnish a test of the fitness of applicants to enter college. As a matter of fact, 
they admit a large proportion of students not ready for college whose happiness and 
usefulness would be found along other paths. Some sincere test of intellectual train- 
ing, independent of the secondary school teacher, and so planned as to leave to the sec- 
ondary school its freedom to offer a liberal education to the great mass of its pupils, 
will serve alike the college and the secondary school. 
The college can take the first great step by a sweeping change in its entrance re- 
quirements. Instead of requiring a dozen subjects and accepting a passing mark on all 
of them, it must test on a few fundamental subjects on which it will demand a very 
high order of performance and accept the work of the secondary school in all other 
subjects. To accept a passing mark of sixty per cent has proved demoralizing alike to 
high school and college, to teacher, and to pupil. In fundamental subjects a high order 
of performance must be secured. This condition complied with, the college can leave 
the secondary school free to educate in its own way.
-P-A-G-E-122
    110 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
Finally, the few fundamental subjects must be those that make for a training of 
the powers of the mind, and which therefore are equally significant both for the col- 
lege and for the secondary school. 
As a provisional solution, I suggest the following test subjects: 
I. The correct spelling, writing, and pronunciation of the English language. 
II. The reading of 25 selected books each year (not with a teacher), and a dis- 
cussion of their contents by each applicant. 
III. Elementary mathematics, including arithmetic, plane geometry, and mechan- 
ical drawing. 
IV. The Constitution and Government of the United States, with special refer- 
erence to the duties of citizenship. 
Tests in subjects II, III, and IV would involve possession of the training indicated 
in subject I. 
These are simple, elementary, and lie at the basis of any education for straight 
thinking and for American citizenship. They ought to be the intellectual tools of 
any high school graduate. They form the indispensable equipment of every college 
student. As a matter of fact, if these requirements were imposed with strictness on 
college students of to-day, their enforcement would depopulate the colleges ! 
The colleges should make tests in these required subjects through appropriate 
means at the end of the second year of high school as well as at the end of the high 
school course of four years. 
Such an arrangement would leave the high school free to teach all its courses for 
their own value. Physics would be taught, not to get boys into college, but in order 
to learn physics. If the fundamental studies are put on a sincere intellectual basis, we 
may safely count that in a reasonable time pretentious and superficial studies now 
crowding the high school curriculum will find an easy and a natural exit. The readjust- 
ment of the high school curriculum is to be had by sincere work in real subjects. A 
study that can grow in an atmosphere of sincere performance will have earned its right 
to remain. 
Those who accept terminology without analysis will find in these views a subscrip- 
tion to the doctrine of “formal discipline,” which exists chiefly in the minds of those 
who decry it as old-fashioned and untrustworthy. Little serious support was ever given 
to the idea that improving one mental function improved every other. Thoughtful 
persons, however, have long believed, what psychological experiment is increasingly 
demonstrating—that mental functions are not independent, but related, and that 
modifying one modifies another so far as they are similar. Certain principles of mental 
organization and ideals of attitude are widely applicable. Vital habits of attention, 
seriousness, and persistence, of precision and method, of confidence and success, which 
are developed in particular studies, are unquestionably of general mental utility and 
moral value.?

  SIMPLIFICATION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL MACHINE 111 
The supreme test we need to-day is one of sincerity of performance. A sixty per 
cent passing mark in all studies means a sixty per cent American. Somewhere in his 
school life, and before it is too late, the youth must come squarely up against the 
demand for a high standard of performance. The sixty per cent college mark has been 
the cause of widespread mediocrity. It has played no small part in the deteriora- 
tion in the use of our mother tongue. The time is ripe for the American college to 
demand high performance in these simple fundamentals. That way lies its greatest 
opportunity for service, both to scholarship and to citizenship. 
THE SIMPLIFICATION OF 
OUR COMPLEX EDUCATIONAL MACHINE 
Tuar our educational machinery must in time be simplified, freshened, and made more 
effective as an agency for the intellectual training of children and youth, is clear. Such 
a process will naturally result in a shortening of the time now demanded to complete 
the prescribed program of studies, stretching from the elementary school to the pro- 
fessional courses of the university. : 
We have assigned in the past an extraordinary importance to four-year periods. 
We give two periods of four years to the grammar school; a four-year period to the 
high school, another four years to the college, and even in the professional schools 
four years tends to be the typical requirement. There is something sacrosanct about 
the four-year term in American education. 
If this expenditure of time, as compared with that demanded in European schools, 
meant a corresponding gain in intellectual power, it would be justified. No such justi- 
fication can be urged. If we are to retain the American college as a permanent part 
of our educational machinery (and it is our distinctive American institution), we must 
make the elementary and secondary school and the college more effective, and less 
expensive in the consumption of the precious years of human training. 
An elementary school covering six years, a secondary school to cover three, and. 
an undergraduate college of three years, all addressing themselves to the work of 
a liberal education in the sense of training the powers of the mind, can be made 
far more fruitful than our present diffuse and time-consuming courses for the im- 
parting of pre-digested knowledge. Toward some such solution we shall no doubt 
slowly progress. To serve the great body of the children and of the youth, to sat- 
isfy the universal human demand for the exercise of individual skill, we must open 
up, from the elementary school and from the secondary school, leadings to techni- 
cal schools in the trades, in agriculture, and in the arts. Our school system of to-day 
falls short in two fundamental requirements—a liberal education in the sense of 
training the powers of the mind, and a technical training for skill in the arts and 
crafts. These are the two great sources of human usefulness and happiness that
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
organized education aims to open up to every member of the body politic—the 
ability to think clearly, and the ability to do some useful service with skill and pre- 
cision. There is no source of human satisfaction more real than the conscious exercise 
of skill, whether in industry, in art, or in science. A widespread enjoyment of tech- 
nical skill would be one of the most prolific sources of human happiness. The de- 
velopment of this type of public education has lagged behind that of the so-called 
higher education. The vocational courses given in the high school are no substitute 
for the sharp, precise training that makes for the sort of technical skill that adds 
joy to work. 
Slowly we may hope for some such gradual transformation. It cannot all be done 
at once. It cannot be done at all until we are ready to make our teaching absolutely 
sincere as far as it goes. To set up in the secondary school the ideal of sincerity is the 
beginning of any such transformation. 
EDUCATION AND POLITICS 
Tue discussion in the new German Republic of the relation of popular education to 
the success and permanence of government by the people is no new thing. This is pre- 
cisely the question that the founders of the American Commonwealth had most at 
heart. They believed that an educated people would take an intelligent interest in 
the questions of government and would decide them upon sound reasons. They be- 
lieved also, that an educated people trained to do their own thinking would be able 
to protect themselves and their government against the vagaries of well-meaning 
doctrinaires on the one hand, and the appeals of demagogues to passion and to pre- 
judice on the other. 
How far popular education has justified these expectations is a matter about which 
there may well be a difference of judgment. Mr. Ramsay Macdonald in his Parliament 
and Revolution says bluntly that the effect of popular education was “not to make 
people intellectually vigorous, but to make them slaves of what they read, and that 
the effect of having the vote was not to make them consider what they could do with 
it, but to make them enjoy an election.” This opinion was put forth when Mr. Mac- 
donald was standing vigorously, as a socialist, for the revival of the Second Inter- 
nationale, whose principles of political action called for the abrogation of nationalism. 
It may be that in his later réle of defender of the British Empire his view may have. 
been different. In any case, if the statement be true that popular education has failed 
to make people intellectually vigorous, the result is not an objection to education it- 
self, but to the form of public education that has failed to wake up the intelligence 
of the great mass of those who go through the schools. 
Mr. Macdonald complains that the masses have not been intelligent enough to use 
the ballot. “Nothing,” he says, “can take the place of intelligence. . . . Where there 
is no intelligence there will be no unity,” His plan of socialism proposed to provide
-P-A-G-E-125
  EDUCATION AND POLITICS 113 
a method of government that would overcome the difficulty of lack of intelligence by 
making the franchise available only to “service givers,” and to get rid of the parasites 
upon the body politic by “economic processes,” whatever that may mean. 
Since that time Mr. Macdonald has had to face the practical problem of govern- 
ment to which he has addressed himself with extraordinary ability and tact. He has 
illustrated afresh what an able and high-minded man can accomplish when he ceases 
to be a doctrinaire and confronts actual problems that must be solved. 
On the whole, the forefathers of the American Commonwealth have been justified 
in their faith that democratic government must go hand in hand with education. 
Simple and meagre as were the facilities for schools during the first seventy-five years 
of the history of our government, the common schools and colleges performed a nota- 
ble work in training the intelligence of the voters. There was a widespread interest 
in public questions. The body of voters went to the polls. Political questions were de- 
bated in the market-place and by the fireside, and on the whole the decisions made 
by the majority vote of all the public have been justified. 
One cannot forget that in the age-long struggle for the triumph of intelligence, the 
contest to-day is not so much against illiteracy as against indifference and stupidity. 
This is illustrated in the politics of our own country. In the days when school facili- 
ties were meagre, the interest in political questions was widespread and the participa- 
tion in the responsibilities of voting was more general than it is to-day. The period of 
great expansion in the school system has coincided with a growing neglect of the obli- 
gation to take part in the government of the country. Minorities elect to offices of the 
highest importance. A presidential election usually calls out the interest of the great- 
est number of citizens. At the presidential election of 1920 less than half the quali- 
fied voters went to the polls. The causes that have operated to bring about this result 
are many. But whatever they may be, the outcome goes to show that our system of pub- 
lic education has not overcome the tendency to indifference to the extent that the au- 
thors of it had expected. There is to-day a determined movement for a national bureau 
to deal with illiteracy. No one questions that illiteracy should be dealt with as rapidly 
as possible, preferably by the communities themselves. But the great mass of the 
American people have been through the common schools. The fact that a majority of 
these fail to vote is a phenomenon outweighing in its political importance the presence 
of a small percentage of illiterates. The school touches all the people more closely 
than any other social institution. The fact that the majority of those who pass through 
it are indifferent to their political duties is a reproach to our system of public educa- 
tion. To teach the illiterate to read is an obligation of society. To give to the whole 
body of youth some clear notion of their duty to the country is vastly more impor- 
tant. How far the responsibility for the present widespread evasion of political duties 
may be attributed to the kind of education given in the schools is a matter worthy 
the best attention of those who have to do with education. From this consideration 
also one is driven back to the realization that the main purpose of a liberal education
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
is to train the habits and powers of the mind rather than to feed it with knowledge. 
Within recent years there has come a relation between public education and pol- 
itics, in the party sense, that must give rise to apprehension in the minds of all 
thoughtful men. Through the National Education Association the public school 
teachers of the country are being organized, as a bloc, in the support of a bill before 
the Congress which carries, among other provisions, a large appropriation available 
“for the partial payment of teachers salaries.” 
This bill proposes to establish a department of education headed by a cabinet 
officer, who shall have an important relation to the schools of every state and com- 
munity. It is one of many efforts, now being pressed, to transfer to a central bureau, 
at Washington, duties hitherto recognized as belonging to the state or to the com- 
munity; and to enlist the resources of the treasury of the United States in support 
of local educational activities. 
Entirely apart from the question of the wisdom or the unwisdom of the particular 
measure, the active effort of the leaders of the National Education Association to 
organize the teachers of tax-supported elementary and secondary schools into a politi- 
cal group, seeking to secure their own desires in legislation by bringing pressure upon 
the Congress, is a matter of grave public concern. In carrying out this process, the 
National Education Association has established headquarters at Washington. It has 
created a “Legislative Division,” another name for a political lobby. This is under the 
control of a “ Legislative” secretary. Through this political organization each member 
of the Congress can be reached, not only by the direct contact with the Legislative 
Division at Washington, but also by the organized pressure of the teachers in his own 
district. If this legislation should be successful, there can be little doubt that in the 
future, public school teachers will constitute a distinct bloc, organized under energetic 
leadership to secure specific benefits for their own group. No greater misfortune could 
befall education and no greater demoralization could come to teachers themselves. 
In the interest of sound public policy and of the profession of teaching the attempt 
to organize public school teachers into a political group ought to cease. 
IDEALS IN EDUCATION 
In the intellectual and moral weariness following in the wake of the World War, 
there is a natural tendency to belittle the part that ideals play in all fields of human 
endeavor. Last autumn, a prominent visitor from Great Britain took pains to set forth 
to Americans the notion that the day of ideals, in national and in international 
causes, had gone by. The incident is worth noting if for no other reason than the 
opportunity to point out the mistake of such an assumption. There was never a time 
when the world was more concerned about ideals, and never a time when it was more 
necessary that its ideals should be those of truth and justice.

       SOME EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRIES 115 
In great intellectual and moral movements, whose fulfilment lies far in the future, 
ideals serve much as the stars do the mariner as he seeks his way across the trackless 
waters to a distant port. He cannot touch them. He cannot feel of them or handle 
them, but looking up to them, fixing his course by them, he brings his ship safe into 
the harbor. Ideals are the stars in the firmament of man’s hope and man’s faith by 
which his course of progress must be determined. There is no other way to find the 
true path save by a vision that can look up to ideals that are true. 
Human education is one of the greatest of man’s endeavors. In this as in all other 
adventures of the human spirit he will find his way to truth only as he fixes his 
course with a vision of the true ideals. 
The gravest reproach that attaches to our generous, wide-flung public education 
of to-day is its lack of intellectual sincerity. When the high school sends up to the 
college students who cannot write their own language with precision, who lack the 
elementary training which makes for clear thinking, it does violence to that ideal of 
intellectual sincerity for which the school was established. The college that accepts 
such students and lends itself to a régime in which the intellectual forces of the col- 
lege life are submerged by the, flood of outside activities, has ceased to look to the 
ideal for which the college exists. A course of study in any subject can be made 
fruitful, if it is sincere. No course is likely to be fruitful in any subject if it pretends 
to do something that it does not and cannot accomplish. The test of intellectual 
sincerity is the one by which our overloaded educational machinery is to be simpli- 
fied. Not everything that is sincere is right, but nothing is right that is not sincere. 
This is the very atmosphere in which education must grow. The school is primarily 
an intellectual agency. Intellectual sincerity is the ideal by which its course must be 
determined. 
SOME EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRIES 
Turoveux its Division of Educational Enquiry, the Carnegie Foundation has con- 
ducted various studies upon matters relating to the methods and the development 
of public education. The reports on Medical Education, on the Training of Teach- 
ers, and on Legal Education were among these studies. A detailed study of Dental 
Education in its relation to public health is in press, and will soon be ready for dis- 
tribution. 
The discussions that have been carried on in the reports of the Foundation for 
the past three years lead me to suggest to the trustees that, in the present state 
of educational advance, it may well be that studies of a more fundamental nature, 
relating not so much to the details as to the qualities of our process of education 
and to the direction of our educational progress, might serve a larger purpose. The 
needs of the professional school to-day hark back to the work of the secondary school. 
Our whole educational process is determined by the kind of education the youth
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 THE DIRECTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 
receives, not by the amount of it. A study that throws light on the question of the 
quality of intellectual training in the secondary school, and the means by which it 
can be bettered, is just now of more significance than an enquiry as to some part of 
our educational structure. 
For example. There is much in print in description of elementary and secondary 
education in European countries, and particularly of the schools in England, France, 
and Germany. It is generally admitted that the youth of these countries receives a 
better training in fundamental subjects, for instance his own language, than does 
the American youth in our corresponding schools, An enquiry to show just how far 
this is true, and the differences of method and of studies that make for a sincere 
training in the few essentials, and which would disentangle this primary question 
from the great mass of details, would help to clarify our knowledge of the situation. 
What is there in these schools, if there be anything, which makes for a sincere be- 
ginning of an education? 
Again an enqui) y to determine what changes can be made in college requirements 
that will leave to ihe secondary school freedom to educate, as best it can, and at the 
same time will en: ble the high school to send up to the college students fitted to 
undertake college work and hospitably minded toward intellectual effort would be 
particularly timely. The situation is ripe for it. We know, in a general way, that the 
intellectual life of the college has been more or less distorted by the growth of activ- 
ities having little 1o do with intellectual progress or the development of the power 
to think. A study ‘etting forth in a fair and sympathetic way an estimate of the ex- 
tent to which the extra-mural activities of the college have come to overshadow its 
intellectual activit es would be a service of great value. It would throw light on many 
phases of our educ ttional problem, and in particular on the question as to what part 
of the college pop uation is attracted to it by other interests than those of getting 
an education. 
The universitie: have also felt the urge to orient themselves with respect to the 
present day intell ctual conditions of the college. As some of the older professional 
courses have declii ed in numbers, for example theology, the university is addressing 
itself to new professional offers. At present the most favored of these is that gener- 
ally known as the s :hool of business administration. The term is somewhat misleading, 
Administration cannot be taught in a school, least of all by those who have had no 
administrative tra ning themselves, or by fugitive lectures from those who have had 
such experience. ‘I hese are really schools of the theory and practice of business. At 
the moment they ¢re the most popular form of university expansion. The professions 
of law, of medicin :, of theology, and of teaching found a place in the university by 
reason of the fact hat they were rooted in the intellectual life. The scientific profes- 
sions have found a similar justification for their presence in the university. There are 
many other callin ys to which a liberal education forms the natural entrance, but 
which have no rea ion to be taught as professions in the university. How far the so-
-P-A-G-E-129
  SOME EDUCATIONAL ENQUIRIES 17 
called school of business administration is fruitful as a university course, either to 
scholarship or to business, is still a matter to be considered. Some fair enquiry on 
this subject, before the universities follow one another into the conventional form of 
university business school, would be exceedingly fruitful. 
At our present stage of educational development such questions seem better worth 
while than studies of detail, for they deal with the direction in which our progress 
is made. To determine the direction of our advance and its probable destination is 
more important, for the moment, than the rate at which we travel. To make the 
American college a place of vigorous intellectual life for those who attend it is more 
important to-day than to add new fields to the vast territory that the college and the 
university have already annexed.

THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
Tue generous sums devoted to higher education in the United States to-day are a 
tribute to the belief of the American people in the cause of education. This gener- 
osity extends both to tax-supported and endowed institutions. The four most lib- 
erally supported universities in the United States, two of which are tax-supported 
and two endowed, will spend for all purposes, including pay of teachers, upkeep of 
plant, and new buildings, as nearly as can be ascertained, the following amounts dur- 
ing the current year: 
Institution Expenditure Instructing Under- Graduate Professional Star graduates Students Students 
California $9,305,000 688 6147 1249 3243 
Michigan 8,043,000 598 4936 635 4132 
Columbia 8,754,000 894, 2944 ; 1872 7010 
Harvard 7,682,000 680 2981 670 3083 
These figures are only approximate. They represent the best information obtain- 
able. They are valuable not in detail but as showing the generous response of the 
people to the appeal for the support of higher education. The world has never known 
such devotion of public and private income to the cause of higher education. 
The comparison brings out the wide variation among our leading institutions as 
to the proportion in which they deal with undergraduates on the one hand and with 
graduate and professional students on the other. The table does not include summer 
school activities or those of university extension or correspondence instruction. 
THE ORGANIZATION OF 
THE EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 
AtruovucH the cost of public education has been an important question before al- 
most every educational gathering since the United States entered the Great War, 
it was not until the immediate financial demands upon the taxpayer incident to 
that conflict had commenced to abate a little, that the matter began to receive the 
attention which it merits. In May, 1920, at the Citizens’ Conference on Education, 
which had been assembled by the Commissioner of Education, Philander P. Clax- 
ton, Professor George D. Strayer, of Teachers College, Columbia University, speak- 
ing before a section meeting on “A New Policy Necessary in Dealing with the Salary 
Situation,” said: “What we most need at present, I think, is a careful systematic 
study of the problems of taxation and school revenues. I should like to propose, for 
the consideration of this conference, the creation of a commission to study the prob- 
lem of financing public education, not primarily from the angle of the cost of edu- 
cation, but from the standpoint of the sources of revenue or the taxes that must be 
levied and the best methods to be employed in order to secure the results needed.”

  122 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
At the conclusion of Dr. Strayer’s address, the meeting voted to request the Com- 
missioner of Education “to bring about the creation of a commission in which school 
men, economists, business men, and research students shall be represented, to make 
a study of the problems of taxation, especially as they relate to the raising of rev- 
enues for the support of public education.” 
The matter was further discussed by a group of persons in attendance at the 
meeting of the Department of Superintendence, National Education Association, at 
Atlantic City in February, 1921, and this group designated a committee to begin 
the study of the problem. The members of this committee were Dean Ellwood P. 
Cubberley, School of Education, Stanford University, chairman; President Edward 
C. Elliott, Purdue University; Professor Robert M. Haig, School of Business, Co- 
lumbia University ; Victor Morawetz, Esq., attorney-at-law, New York City ; Profes- 
sor Henry C. Morrison, Superintendent of Laboratory Schools, University of Chicago; 
and Professor George D. Strayer, Teachers College, Columbia University. These gen- 
tlemen met at New York City in August, 1921, and prepared a report which indicated 
the extent, administration, and cost of the project: “For the purpose of making, 
in selected, typical communities and states, an intensive study of present expendi- 
tures for the several grades and institutions of public education, and the relationships 
of such expenditures to the expenditures for other public purposes and to economic 
resources, as a basis for discovering the extent to which the free educational system 
of the country can be maintained and developed by the more complete and economic 
utilization of both present and potential sources of public revenue—local, state, and 
national — the Committee recommends that there be instituted an Educational 
Finance Enquiry.” It recommended also that the entire control of this enquiry be 
vested in a commission competent to direct the undertaking, the members of which 
should actively participate in the work. The Commission was to consist of Messrs. 
Cubberley, Elliott, Haig, Morrison, Morawetz,and Strayer, and Mr. Herbert S. Weet, 
Superintendent of Schools, Rochester, New York. Later, other members were added: 
Mr. E. C. Brooks, State Superintendent of Public Intruction, North Carolina, who 
subsequently became President of the North Carolina State College of Agriculture 
and Engineering ; Dr. Samuel P. Capen, Director American Council on Education, 
afterward Chancellor of the University of Buffalo; Dr. Thomas E. Finegan, State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction for Pennsylvania, now retired from that office ; 
and Dr. Charles R. Mann, successor of Dr. Capen as Director of the American Coun- 
cil on Education. Professor Strayer became chairman of the Commission. The cost of 
the project was estimated to be $170,000. 
This report the Committee submitted to the officers of the Carnegie Corporation 
of New York, the Commonwealth Fund, the General Education Board, and the Mil- 
bank Fund, who had already signified their interest in the matter, and the respective 
boards of these foundations accepted the report and provided funds for the enquiry ; 
the first three in the amount of $50,000 each, the Milbank Fund, $20,000. This sum
-P-A-G-E-135

of $170,000 was voted to the American Council on Education for the purposes of the 
Commission, and the responsibility of the foundations ceased entirely with this ac- 
tion. The Commission, as enlarged, undertook the investigation with responsibility 
for the work. 
The enquiry began promptly. Through the generosity of Teachers College, Co- 
lumbia University, office space was procured late in September, 1921, which became 
the headquarters of the Commission, and two rooms were devoted to. the assembling 
and tabulation of data. In the following month organization was well advanced, and, 
on October 24, the first regular meeting of the Commission was called. During the 
two years ending in October, 1923, the Commission convened for six meetings of one 
week each, and for two informal sittings of one day, devoted to the general super- 
vision and review of the investigation. In order that the Commission might have com- 
petent criticism of its work before publication, the American Council on Education 
appointed the following Advisory Committee, although all responsibility for the 
enquiry rests with the Commission: President James R. Angell, Yale University; 
Dean C. E. Chadsey, School of Education, University of Illinois; Mr. Wesley C. 
Mitchell, Director, National Bureau of Economic Research; Professor E. R. A. Selig- 
man, Columbia University; Mr. Frank A. Vanderlip; Mr. Matthew Woll, Vice-Presi- 
dent, American Federation of Labor; and Dr. Will C. Wood, State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, California. 
At the headquarters of the Commission, the following staff worked: Professor 
Strayer, as Director, Dr. Haig, Associate Director, Dr. Carter Alexander, Assistant 
Director, Dr. Howard G. Burdge, Assistant Director for the State of New York, Miss 
Mabel Newcomer, Economist, and Miss Mabelle M. Campbell, Secretary to the Com- 
mission. For each study which the Commission has undertaken, special investigators 
and assistants have been secured, sometimes local, sometimes attached to the Head- 
quarters Staff. The publications of the Commission have been prepared in the main 
by members of the Commission or of the Headquarters Staff, although some of them 
have been made by these special investigators. The thirteen reports are as follows:

THE INITIAL REPORTS OF 
THE EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 
Tue Educational Finance Enquiry has presented the first results of its labors in six 
volumes of the series listed above. Of these, the three reports that deal with New York 
State may be considered the most important, as representing the efforts of the Com- 
mission to handle the problem of state school finance in an original and illuminating 
fashion. New York was selected as the state from which the most reliable data could 
most readily be secured. The magnitude of its annual expenditure, the variety of its 
educational problems, and the progressive character of its school administration were 
additional considerations: it was believed that to make clear the relation between 
education and its money cost in the State of New York would prove more useful and 
significant for the country as a whole than an analysis of any other district. 
Of the three volumes devoted to New York State, the first contains a general pre- 
sentation and discussion of all the findings, while volumes two and three elaborate 
details for the elementary and secondary schools. Volume one, therefore, contains 
what is presumably the most important product that the Finance Enquiry has to 
offer. 
A careful reading of these initial reports makes it clear that no pains have been 
spared to ensure accuracy of statement, to avoid inference from too few data, and to let 
the facts speak for themselves. Indeed, one of the conspicuous features of the produc- 
tion is the extent to which interpretation has been suppressed, and the bare figures 
have been left to carry whatever significance the reader may assign to them. As an 
audit of the educational accounts of the State of New York, the study leaves little to 
be desired. The figures already gathered in various official quarters and available to 
the public are assembled and re-stated much as any state commissioner of education 
might periodically review his financial situation. 
It is a fair assumption, however, that more was to have been expected from a Com- 
mission of such standing and resources than an audit of accounts. No helpful study
-P-A-G-E-137
REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 125 
of educational finance can be divorced from some consideration of the purchasable 
values involved. The terms “elementary,” “secondary,” and “higher education” are 
expressions covering a wide range of conditions and practices. Why bring in profes- 
sional aid to sum up a blanket expenditure of this type or to array its statistics ? 
The justification of a financial study by experts in education is precisely in order that 
current practices shall be analyzed, in terms of their cost as related to their demon- 
strable merits. In no other way can a rational perspective of such costs in the civic 
budget be assumed. : 
Little of such evaluation appears in the reports which have been issued. At a time 
when people are bewildered by the variety and frequent contradiction of educational 
procedure, when the total charges therefor constitute an ever mounting proportion of 
a staggering burden of taxation, an expert commission with ample time and funds at 
its disposal presents merely a technical balance sheet that one would expect of a cer- 
tified public accountant, and throws no light on what the taxpayer is receiving for 
his money. 
The Commission appears to forestall criticism of this sort with the warning that 
it “was not appointed to investigate the quality of the education now furnished by 
the schools, or the character and extent of the education which should be furnished at 
public expense.”1 It does propose, however, “an intensive study of present expendi- 
tures for the several grades and institutions of public education.” The extent to which 
in educational finance a study may become “intensive” without encroaching upon 
“quality” is perhaps a matter of opinion. The Commission has presented long lists of 
per-capita expenditures, running from extreme minimums in certain municipalities 
to apparently foolish and extravagant maximums in others—all for an undefined com- 
modity called “education.” Any definition of this product in terms of well-understood 
standards, such as the training of teachers concerned, the size of classes, the excel- 
lence of equipment, and the scope of the curriculum, has been carefully avoided, 
apparently because of its relation to “ quality.” 
Many competent judges will consider this a serious mistake. The differences in edu- 
cational procedure resulting from the application in various degrees of the standards 
suggested above are differences in kind, and include wide qualitative variations within 
themselves. It may not have been incumbent on the Commission to judge the per- 
formance of the teachers of a given town; it would have been quite possible, how- 
ever, and, indeed, indispensable to a penetrating enquiry, to consider what the train- 
ing and salaries of those teachers should be in determining the kind of education for 
which that community was paying. With such considerations ignored, “intensive- 
hess” concerns itself with a mass of statistical detail that is well-nigh useless. Com- 
menting upon a blind array of figures, the report observes:? “If the wide variation 
in costs shown in the diagram indicates a corresponding variation in educational ad- 
vantages, the question at once arises as to whether this latter variation can be justi- 
1 Vol. I, p. 19. 2P. 48,
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
fied, or whether there is extravagance in some cases and at the same time offerings 
below the ‘necessary minimum’ of educational opportunity in others.” It was to an- 
swer precisely this question that the Commission might well have directed its efforts. 
Again, the report remarks that “the variations in the standards are shown to be so 
great in this table! that the State Department of Education would seem to be obliged 
to set on foot a critical analysis of the condition existing in union schools.” Consider- 
ing that the data for these findings were on file in the New York State Department 
of Education before the Enquiry began, one feels moved to ask why the Commission’s 
“intensive enquiry” should not have made this critical analysis its own task. The facts 
of extraordinary variation have been known and stated for many years; if a clear ex- 
position could have been made of the costs of the various kinds of education with 
which our several communities are experimenting, a service of great value would have 
been rendered. 
A striking example of such omission occurs in the matter of technical secondary 
education. The developments in urban centres during recent years have involved the 
organization and equipment of technical high schools wherein are offered all manner 
of courses in elementary applied science with a view to anticipating the training re- 
quired in a large number of vocations. This movement represents a distinct theory 
of the function of the secondary school which, if justified, will result in the general 
if not universal introduction of such training at public expense. Such training is un- 
questionably very costly in the initial installation and to only a slightly less degree in 
its maintenance, It was of first importance that a significant and relatively new educa- 
tional procedure of this kind should be given a thoroughgoing financial analysis in 
comparison with other types of secondary training. In the principal report, however,’ 
all high school outgo for current expenses is lumped together for groups of cities of 
various sizes, the only analysis being a list of per-pupil costs of various subjects on the 
sole basis of the distribution of the teachers salaries. Here as elsewhere, all differentia- 
tion of kind as determined by known standards is carefully shunned. In its estimate 
of plant costs the main report not only groups all high schools together, but throws 
them into one class with elementary schools, thus losing track of them completely. 
One turns to the detailed study of secondary education* with the confident ex- 
pectation of discovering therein material that shall throw some light on these funda- 
mental questions. This special report contains essentially three things: first, in Chap- 
ter IV, an elaborately detailed study in variation of per-pupil costs among New York 
communities; second, in Chapters V and VI, a study of high school support, attend- 
ance, and organization; and, third, in Chapter VII, an analysis of subject costs in 458 
high schools. 
Chapter IV shows effectively by comparisons of costs per pupil how the costs of edu- 
cation have increased from 1910 to 1920. Beyond this, the reader discovers only such 
facts as that one three-year union school costs $34 per pupil and another for the same 
1 Vol. III, p. 62. 2 Vol. I. 8 Vol. III.
-P-A-G-E-139
  REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 127 
year costs $1132. Chapters V and VI deal with several interesting and profitable items 
unrelated to the differentiation in question. Chapter VII, however, appears to promise 
an answer until one learns that the “subject costs” presented consist merely of a dis- 
tribution of teachers salaries, as determined by hours taught and number of pupils in 
the class. These are worked out in detail for a large group of academic high schools. 
Then, as an after thought, “as requests for cost figures on junior high schools and 
technical high schools came to the Enquiry,” five junior high schools and three tech- 
nical high schools were analyzed in the same fashion. In the latter group figures are 
given for 65 courses in one school, 18 in a second, and 9 in a third. 
Thus the Enquiry appears originally to have intended to treat only academic high 
schools, as fulfilling its whole duty concerning the cost of the secondary curriculum. 
It seems then to have been reminded that at least two other important types needed 
consideration, and dealt with these in perfunctory fashion. In other words, the gen- 
eral problem of curriculum costs was never thoroughly analyzed, and pertinent data 
wherewith to solve it were not sought. 
Furthermore, the cost elements wherein technical education confessedly outranks 
all others, namely, in initial outlay for plant and in maintenance other than for sal- 
aries, have been wholly ignored, so that it is impossible from any figures here pre- 
sented to draw conclusions as to the comparative cost of these types of education. 
Taken by and large, therefore, the analysis of educational costs in New York State 
presented by the Commission is disappointing. With an elaborate flourish of scientific 
statistics it has marched us once more up to the concrete problem that we have con- 
fronted for many years only to harangue us at great length with refinements of 
economic theory. Consequently we know only what we knew before; namely, that 
so-called “ elementary ” and “ secondary ” education costs thus and so much ; that the 
instruction alone in different subjects costs in proportion to the salary of the teacher, 
the hours of instruction, and the size of the class; and that these costs vary greatly 
from school to school. All of this was substantially set forth in the Foundation’s study 
of Education in Vermont ten years ago. 
It cannot be sufficiently emphasized that a series of figures dependent upon the 
combination of a group of variables, for each of which allowances and explanations 
must be made, can have little to teach until those allowances and explanations have 
been thoroughly reckoned with. It was to have been expected that a Commission of 
educational experts would deal with these factors; this was the chief feature of the 
task that required their expert educational judgment. After studying the arrays of 
per-pupil costs offered by the Enquiry, the school superintendent asks immediately : 
“But what is the cost, under reasonable conditions, of the kind of education that 
I may properly recommend for my community? How should the costs of the single 
and double session elementary school, the platoon organization, the academic high 
school, the junior high school, the technical high school, the commercial high school, 
or the junior college, differ from one another on the basis of the best New York ex-
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
perience, and why ?” In Chapter X of Volume one, the Commission goes into a dis- 
cussion of the necessity of education and of its economic significance, and in Chap- 
ter XII it develops the desirability of the larger administrative unit, all of which 
is purely “qualitative” as the Commission understands the term, yet it apparently 
conceives itself powerless to put its finger on the cost of a kind of education that is 
demonstrably better or worse, or involves varying objectives. 
A brief résumé of the first volume of the report, chapter by chapter, will give some 
conception of its contents, although it is difficult to review a mass of statistical facts 
presented with so little attempt to organize them coherently into an intelligible whole. 
The so-called “Summary” with which the volume opens does much less than jus- 
tice even to the modest achievement of the subsequent text. The author has assumed 
that lifting quantities of unrelated figures from the succeeding chapters will pro- 
duce a clear conception of the Commission’s findings that will enlighten the reader 
who may not always proceed to examine the text. The result is a dull array of life- 
less statistics — a trail of sand, heavily and carelessly scattered. Repelled by the dis- 
couraging literary quality of the opening sentence, the reader is benumbed before the 
brief chapter is half over, and with a glance at the later tables and diagrams that 
look forbidding, is disposed to drop the book. 
The Commission proves eventually to have things to say that are of value, and it 
is a pity that care was not taken to distill the essence of them into a readable form 
within the fourteen pages of the introduction. 
Following a short statement of the circumstances leading to the Enquiry, Chap- 
ter II deals with “The Educational Program of the State of New York.” It traces 
briefly the development of the Board of Regents, indicating their present powers; 
and rehearses the population statistics of the state, showing that the Enquiry has to 
deal with one-eleventh of the country’s population and that all types of community 
are involved. 
The “program” is simply a review of purely legal provisions. Thus school attend- 
ance during a minimum of 180 days each year is compulsory for children from eight 
to sixteen years of age in communities of less than 4500 persons. In places over this 
size that employ a superintendent the age is seven to sixteen, unless children over 
fourteen are legally at work. In districts of 5000 or more, part-time continuation 
schools are provided for children between fourteen and fifteen years of age. These 
will be fully developed by September, 1925. Evening schools are required for persons 
over sixteen. Kindergartens are permitted for children from four to six years of age. 
Authority for secondary education is inferred from the age limits above quoted, and 
from the provision that districts without a high school may contract with neighbor- 
ing districts at the rate of $50 per pupil. Certain secondary schools of agriculture 
and domestic science are maintained by the state. 
In higher education the State of New York “may be said to encourage certain 
qualified students to continue their courses in college or university, rather than to
-P-A-G-E-141
  
REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 129 
make general provision for free higher education.” Scholarships and special state and 
city schools are enumerated. The institutions for training teachers are described with- 
out indicating the extent to which their services are mandatory as determined by 
requirements for teachers certificates. The compulsory provisions for the blind, deaf, 
crippled, or otherwise physically handicapped or mentally retarded are stated, to- 
gether with the permissive legislation for dealing with illiteracy, Americanization, 
and certain local educational situations. 
It is pointed out that of the 220 millions spent on education in 1921, 52 millions, 
or 23.6 per cent, were provided from private sources, while 168 millions, or 76.4 per 
cent, were chargeable against the public treasury. 
As a frame in which the real educational program of the state might be studied, 
this outline is useful. In themselves, however, such gross terms as “ elementary educa- 
tion” and “secondary education” may mean much or little. Unless they are more 
closely defined, an assessment of total costs, whatever general interest it may have, 
is of little use to those who would intelligently compare the merits of expenditures 
for education with those for other public purposes. The real educational program of 
the state can be discovered only by learning the offerings which the various com- 
munities are actually undertaking within these broad categories. It is with such 
offerings and their differentiation that a truly useful analysis of costs would have 
to do. 
Chapter III sets forth the total cost of public education and its growth. The 
strictly public system of education, excluding libraries, defectives, and delinquents, 
cost the state about 168 millions in 1921 (“accrued economic cost”). This sum is 
analyzed into (1) current expenses and (2) plant costs, and comparable figures are 
given since 1910. With the exception of certain estimates of interest and deprecia- 
tion, the data are all drawn from the State Department of Education, the State 
Comptroller, and the Comptroller of the City of New York. Current expenses, ex- 
cluding interest, have increased from 474 millions in 1910 to 159 millions in 1922, 
or more than three-fold. The increase in 1921 alone of nearly 47 millions was nearly 
as great as the total outlay in 1910. In New York City the amount has risen from 
27 millions to 86 millions. While the rise slackened during the war years, there has 
been no actual decrease at any time in either city or state. 
The aggregate plant costs are figured in two ways: “cash disbursements” and “ an- 
nual accrued economic charge.” 
As regards cash disbursement, the amounts actually spent annually for sites, build- 
ings, equipment, and interest on borrowed funds are shown to have risen from 12 mil- 
lions in 1910 to nearly 37 millions in 1922. In 1916 there was a marked drop from 
18 millions to a low level (12 millions), which continued (12 to 16 millions) until 
1921, when a rise of 11 millions occurred. The point is urged that the figure at this 
latter stage— 27 millions — does not represent compensation for the preceding low 
level, and is not greater than the normal amount foreshadowed by the progress, 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  130 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
1910-15, from 12 millions to 18 millions. Depreciation offsets nearly one-half of the 
total capital outlay from 1910 to 1921, and there was an increase of 22 per cent in 
the average daily pupil attendance. Meanwhile, in the latter half of the period, con- 
struction costs rose to such a point that the accommodations procured for the same 
outlay were not half of those procured during the first six years. The inference is that 
in order to recover from war conditions, the peak of capital outlay is still well ahead. 
New York City has spent relatively less for plant during the past three years than 
in 1910 and 1915. In 1910 its interest payments were seven-eighths of the state 
total; in 1920-22 they constituted but two-thirds. 
The “annual accrued economic charge” of plant is calculated by adding to the cur- 
rent expenses the depreciation and the interest on the total investment (not simply on 
borrowed funds). This gives a more regular rate of increase, over the period consid- 
ered, than the total cash disbursements ; “ but, after all, the differences in the aggre- 
gate are not very great.” 
From the total of current expenses and plant outlay, it appears that the aggre- 
gate has trebled since 1910— 58 millions being added in 1921 alone, largely through 
the operation of the new salary law. Expense for high schools has increased from 8 
to 19 millions (1920); for elementary schools, from 48 to 92 millions (1920) ; these two 
divisions accounting for 95.1 per cent of the total in 1910 and 95.9 per cent in 1922. 
In 1920, the last year for which separate data are available, the elementary schools 
alone took 78.5 per cent of the total. Though expenses for higher education increased 
at a faster rate than those in any other division, its share was small: $1,491,000 in 
1910 ; $4,372,000 in 1920; and $6,133,000 in 1922. 
The general financial picture sketched in Chapter III is clear and satisfactory. The 
calculated “accrued economic charge” is an interesting variation that is useful for 
comparison, but one is obliged for the most part to fall back on the simpler cash dis- 
bursement figures. These are from the same sources and differ in no way from the 
figures that one would expect to find in an annual report of a well-administered state 
department of education. 
Chapters IV and V present an analysis of the current expenses and plant costs of 
public education as summarized in Chapter III. They occupy fifty pages of the one 
hundred and ninety pages of the report. In these two chapters lies the fundamental 
task of the Enquiry in its educational aspect. What are the costly elements in edu- 
cation? What financial obligations do the essentials in this highly generalized term 
involve? How are the steadily mounting sums asked for being expended, and do the 
benefits secured constitute acknowledged and defensible values? Satisfactory answers 
must be had to such questions as these before any proposal to revise our revenue sys- 
tem in order to provide for larger educational appropriations can with decency be 
presented. 
The Commission’s treatment of this group of problems has already been discussed. 
It presents costs per pupil in various city and village groups representing wholly
-P-A-G-E-143
REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 131 
unanalyzed conditions, and varying between wide extremes in a manner that is prob- 
ably explicable in the individual case, but is nowhere explained. The result is an 
expensive statistical exercise that sheds no light on the difficult questions of the 
situation. The figuring is extended by distributing teachers salaries over grades and 
subjects, a procedure which likewise yields no practical outcome. These salary data 
were, so far as appears, the only new facts asked for by the Commission at the source, 
that is, from the schools themselves. The remaining materials of the report, with rare 
minor exceptions, seem to have been compiled from readily accessible official docu- 
ments. 
This use of average and median cost per pupil for a group of cities, and for grades 
and subjects, differs radically from uses to which a careful analysis of per-pupil costs 
may be put where all the underlying conditions are thoroughly known, as in a single 
school or school system, to discover exactly where the money goes. Superintendent 
Spaulding’s analyses of the Newton, Massachusetts, schools (1910-13) were extraor- 
dinarily illuminating because they were fully self-explanatory in the light of the 
known facts of administration in that system. Thus a similar study by the Commis- 
sion of a few schools, with a careful comparison of conditions and a differentiation 
of curricula and objectives, might have been of very substantial value. 
The section on plant costs is satisfactory and helpful in so far as it deals with total 
outlay. For the city of New York particularly it sets forth some valuable findings. 
Plant costs as related to different kinds of education, however, are overlooked alto- 
gether. It is at this point that the costs of different types of education often differ 
most widely, and the Commission might well have given the matter careful attention, 
as already explained in the case of technical education. 
Chapters VI and VII deal with the support of education in New York State in an 
analytical and minutely descriptive fashion, which is doubtless accurate and is cer- 
tainly comprehensive. It is difficult reading. 
Chapter VIII, taking present costs and tendencies as a basis, attempts an estimate 
of expenditures for education in New York State during the immediate future. Most 
of the assumptions are arbitrary or partial, or are open to criticism on other grounds. 
Thus, the extension of kindergartens throughout the state and compulsory educa- 
tion from the age of six are contemplated, and the cost is estimated, yet various 
other extensions, not considered here, would be quite as reasonable. An estimate is 
made of the cost of giving full-time training to those pupils in New York City now 
on part time —surely an appropriate item. But this is followed by pro-rating the 
same proportion of increase over the remainder of the state, apparently on the theory 
that part-time instruction is as prevalent elsewhere as in New York City. No proof 
of such conditions is offered, and the situation implied seems highly improbable. Fur- 
thermore, no account is taken of the heavy additional teaching and supervisory ex- 
penditure annually involved in reorganizing these part-time and over-size classes. 
The estimate is for plant costs alone. Only this item of part-time instruction may
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
be said to be an unfulfilled legal requirement. The progressive enlargement of voca- 
tional opportunities is proceeding as called for in the statute; the other increases 
are proposals of the Commission. 
On the basis of increases in cash disbursements from 1910 up to and including 1922, 
when expenditures reached 196 millions, the estimate is arrived at that 226 millions 
will be required in 1930, or with the addition of the extra 21 millions proposed by the 
Commission, 247 millions, Although it would be quite as difficult to defend an esti- 
mate made otherwise, it is apparent that the arbitrary elements which fix this amount 
are such as to make it largely hypothetical. Conditions that have influenced the main 
tendency during the twelve years under consideration have been of an abnormal char- 
acter, and the extraordinary outlay of the last two years is given what is apparently 
excessive weight. 
Part Two of Volume one, which occupies about seventy of the one hundred and 
ninety pages of the report, undertakes to analyze the financial resources of New York 
State with relation to educational expenditures. It is much the most satisfactory part 
of the book, although its conclusions are continually weakened by the vague impres- 
sions carried over from Part One as to what sort of thing it is that the state is being 
asked to finance under the name of education. 
The first chapter (IX) enumerates certain factors that determine a commonwealth’s 
potential educational resources, such as general economic vigor, attitude toward the 
products of education, confidence in the educational régime, and efficiency of taxing 
and administrative arrangements. An estimate is made of the resources of New York 
State in terms of income and real estate values, and a comparison is instituted be- 
tween these and educational expenditures since 1910. It is shown thereby that “the 
expenditures for public education per child of school age have nearly trebled during 
a period when income has only doubled and real estate values have increased only 37 
per cent.” “Clearly . . . New York was devoting a larger share of its economic effort 
to the support of public education in 1922 than it did in 1910.” The increase repre- 
sents an “expanded program,” in addition to attracting and holding a larger portion 
of the children of school age. It includes “a more varied and more elaborate curric- 
ulum” and additional “services,” such as “transportation of pupils, improved admin- 
istration, health service, kindergartens, vocational, and continuation schools.” 
The second chapter of Part Two (Chapter X) goes at once to the heart of the 
whole problem of educational finance and sets in clear and suggestive order the con- 
siderations involving a community’s willingness and ability to pay. It is pointed out 
that “the economic limitations of educational expenditures,” as the chapter is en- 
titled, “depend chiefly and fundamentally upon the balance which the community can 
actually make available for education through thrift and efficiency, after the neces- 
sary maintenance costs of society and the necessary capital reserves have been provided 
for. Additional economic support cannot be provided merely by popular devotion to 
1P, 138,
-P-A-G-E-145
  
REPORTS OF EDUCATIONAL FINANCE ENQUIRY 133 
the cause of education.” It may be made available, however, either through greater 
production or through diversion of existing resources. “Increasing the resources to be 
devoted to education is not primarily a problem of discovering new and unsuspected 
sources of public revenue. It is rather a problem of persuading the community to de- 
vote its available resources to the support of educational activity to the extent that the 
educational product promises a more valuable return than other alternative activi- 
ties.” This is precisely what New York State has done. “Whereas education absorbed 
21.5 per cent of all state and local taxes in 1910, it consumed 23.3 per cent in 1920 
and 30 per cent in 1921.” In so far as this is not merely a shift from private to 
public expenditure, it appears to mark an actual change in the perspective in which 
education is regarded with relation to other interests. Arguing from the rapidly 
increasing wealth of the state, the chapter concludes: “Clearly the support can be 
greatly increased, if the people are willing to meet the conditions. But as it is impos- 
sible to estimate how far the community is able and willing to increase production 
and to countenance diversion, it is also impossible to estimate in any quantitative 
manner the limits of additional support.” 
Resolved thus finally into a question of popular conviction, the problem seems 
more than ever to demand a cost analysis that will show the public wherein lies the 
essential good of the process for which it has to pay, and where its funds are likely 
to be ill-spent. Had the cogent reasoning of this chapter been preceded by an effective 
treatment of this sort in Part One, the combination would have carried great weight. 
The remaining four chapters of the study may be dismissed briefly. Chapters XI 
and XII are devoted to a discussion of the revenue system of New York State in 
the belief that the solution of the problem of educational finance is a question of 
tax reform and not a matter of discovering new sources of funds. It presents conclu- 
sions that have been under consideration by expert bodies for many years and com- 
mand general approval. Chapter XIII gives the results of an inconclusive study of 
the merits of financing schools by separate and independent boards as contrasted 
with boards or committees controlled by the chief municipal authorities. In so far as 
costs are concerned, the two systems produce approximately the same results. Chap- 
ter XIV offers certain considerations having to do with the present school budgetary 
procedure and system of accounting, the financing of capital outlays, insurance, and 
the codification of the Education Law. 
Throughout the United States there is growing a question whether public educa- 
tion, as it is at present conducted, is costing more than its measurable results are 
worth. The attitude of mind which gives rise to this question is not confined to ac- 
ademic investigators; it is recurring with increasing insistency and frequency among 
the men and women most practically concerned with the problems of which it is a 
result, namely, the superintendents. The first three volumes of the Commission’s re- 
port seem to proceed upon the assumptions that the quality of our education is now 
satisfactory, that the only way improvement can be effected is by spending upon our 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 THE FINANCING OF EDUCATION 
present program larger and larger sums raised through increased revenues from taxa- 
tion, and that tax reform is the effectual means of meeting the situation. With this 
solution few of the persons most directly concerned, whether administrators or tax- 
payers, will be content. The fundamental educational questions before any state, mu- 
nicipality, or school district turn upon quality. Is the quality of our present public 
education satisfactory? Are the enterprises and courses which we are now supporting 
yielding the results for which we have the right to hope? How much more money, if 
any, must we spend each year before we shall receive a fair return? These questions 
the first three volumes of the Commission’s report do not answer. The remaining 
volumes, and indeed the entire series, will be valued by many persons in the degree in 
which they measure these problems and indicate for them a possible practical solution. 
Whatever view with regard to these questions may be held by the Commission or 
others, there can be no defense for a formless and lifeless manner of presentation, and 
the failure to make clear such conclusions as may have been reached.

PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
AutuoucH the year ended June 30, 1924, has brought forth the enactment of little 
legislation affecting the retirement of teachers in the public schools, it has been 
marked by much activity and study bearing upon the problems underlying the sub- 
ject of pensions. A considerable number of signs give grounds for the hope that the 
day of hasty and ill-considered enactment of pension laws is passing, and that in time 
there will be formed a body of public opinion sufficiently enlightened, first, to recog- 
nize the value of a sound retirement system in the public schools of any state, and, 
secondly, to proceed with care when opportunity offers for securing new and, espe- 
cially, when revising old, legislation. 
Possibly the most significant phase of this more enlightened activity is represented 
by the stand of the National Education Association as set forth in the proceedings 
of its meeting at Oakland and San Francisco in July, 1923, and in documents pub- 
lished since that time as a result of the deliberations of certain of its committees. 
Unfortunately, it is not possible to commend the Association’s pronouncement in 
every respect, but its immediate program promises much good. Scarcely less signifi- 
cant is the movement which brought together the secretaries and other officers of 
several state teachers retirement systems for a conference at Chicago in February, 
1924, The actual benefits of this first meeting were perhaps not many, and it is dif- 
ficult to evaluate them, but at the same time the interchange of ideas and the com- 
mon discussion which such gatherings, well conducted, make possible, should clarify 
many of the difficulties which arise in the daily duties of administrative officers and 
may also be of importance in the development of retirement systems with common 
purposes. Such activities as these which have been enumerated may enable the United 
States to anticipate and avoid some of the pitfalls into which the advocates of free 
pensions for teachers in England have fallen, and certainly it should keep this coun- 
try out of the mire which has engulfed the Argentine Republic, owing to hasty and 
ill-advised legislation during the past year. The results are already discernible in the 
fate of the ill-considered bills affecting New York City. 
Tue Narionat Epucation AssociaTIon AND TEACHERS RETIREMENT 
The activities of the National Education Association with respect to teachers re- 
tirement have found expression in two documents, one a report printed in the Ad- 
dresses and Proceedings of the Sixty-first Annual Meeting, held at Oakland and San 
Francisco, July 1-6, 1923, the other a set of principles governing retirement, pub- 
lished provisionally in June, 1924. Both of these documents contain material which 
should be commended, but the first is scarcely so considered and well rounded as the 
second.
-P-A-G-E-150
    138 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
The Oakland-San Francisco Report 
The report of the Association’s Committee on Pensions, as printed in the Ad- 
dresses and Proceedings of the Sixty-first Annual Meeting, divides itself into two 
parts: the first deals in general terms with the progress of pension systems for teach- 
ers in the states of the Union, passes to the state-wide character of the retirement 
problem, discusses the national quality of the task involved in informing the public 
of the need for sound retirement systems, and states as its ideals: 
“J. That all of the schools of the Nation receive the benefit of adequate pro- 
vision for the retirement of teachers, upon plans financially secure, and just to 
the teachers, and to the public. 
“TI. That unwise plans, which may fail to benefit the schools, or result in re- 
pudiation of obligations, or place undue burdens on the taxpayers, be avoided.” 
These ideals are eminently sound, and the National Education Association might 
well lend the whole weight of its influence to their furtherance. But the next sen- 
tence of the report touches upon a matter which, as the phrasing shows, not only is 
open to question, but can offer only limited inducements to sound activity: “In fur- 
therance of these ends, it is the distinct duty of the National Education Association 
to ascertain what part, if any, may properly be taken by the government of the 
United States toward aiding or encouraging the establishment of retirement systems 
in the schools.” Discussion of this question must be put aside for the moment. 
“It has been suggested,” the report continues, “that the National Education 
Association could render invaluable service by making provision along some or 
all of the following lines: 
“I. Systematic investigations of the many fundamental problems which must 
be solved in order that a retirement system can be so planned as to give the 
greatest benefit to the schools. 
“TI. Publication and discussion, for the education of both teachers and public, 
as to the proper functions of a retirement system, and the fundamental require- 
ments of satisfactory systems. 
“III. Co-operation with state or local boards or associations by furnishing 
information and advice. 
“IV. Investigation of the extent to which Federal aid to state or local retire- 
ment funds is feasible or desirable, and formulation of a suitable program.” 
As to the first three of these four steps, no organization is in a better position than 
the Association to undertake them, except for one very pertinent fact: the member- 
ship of the Association is composed almost entirely of teachers, and teachers are inter- 
ested parties when retirement systems are under discussion. On the other hand, given 
the essential impartiality of leadership, and the very necessary regard to the teacher’s 
two-fold function in the body politic as both employee and taxpayer, there would 
seem to be only a clear field for the proposed activities of the Association with re- 
spect to the first three of these proposals.
-P-A-G-E-151
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 139 
The fourth question, Federal aid to teachers pensions, is more difficult. That the 
Committee on Pensions has already begun the consideration of it is shown by ap- 
pended material, furnished by Dr. Charles E. Brooks, actuary, and Attorney-General 
Herman L. Ekern, of the State of Wisconsin. They first survey the field of teachers 
pensions, noting nine foreign countries, twenty-two of the states of the Union, and 
forty-nine cities and counties which support teachers retirement systems. “In only 
asmall number of the plans has provision been made for the permanent and adequate 
financial resources. . . . Not only are the majority of the funds unsound financially 
but in general it may be said that the conditions are neither fair to the teachers, 
nor are they such as to promote the welfare and efficiency of the profession as a whole.” 
Thus far the statements of these two gentlemen may be accepted practically with- 
out reservation. But when they write, “The problem is so difficult and the benefits to 
be derived from the satisfactory solution so great that it must be solved by Nation- 
wide effort. A proposal that the United States Government assist the several states 
in establishing and maintaining retirement systems for the betterment of their public 
schools would involve no new policy,” they enter upon doubtful ground. 
Messrs. Brooks and Ekern state the essential features to be embodied in the plan 
as follows: 
1, The states must make adequate financial provision for the retirement of 
teachers employed in public educational institutions within their boundaries, 
upon fair and reasonable terms. 
“2, The United States will give financial assistance to any state which does 
make such provisions by bearing that part of the cost which is attributable to 
teaching service rendered in the past. 
“3, The United States will require conformity to requirements which are es- 
sential to the permanent success of the retirement system, but will leave to the 
states which meet these requirements full discretion to carry them out by meth- 
ods which best meet local conditions.” 
In short, it is advocated that the Federal government should assume the accrued 
liabilities of the teachers retirement systems of the United States. “The cost from 
the point of view of national expenditure is almost insignificant. It can be asserted 
with confidence that a sum sufficient to carry out this project, and to establish the 
system on a permanent basis for every school of every state would not exceed the 
amount paid by the United States for highway construction during five years.” It 
must, however, be emphasized that these are merely assertions, as their authors admit ; 
no figures are submitted, no facts are expounded, in support of these contentions. 
That there are facts to be compiled, examined, and analyzed, no one will deny — 
actuaries and attorneys, last of all. Their estimates of the cost of the Federal gov- 
ernment’s assuming the accrued liabilities for the teachers pension systems in the 
United States cannot be said to be directly or openly made. When the figures are 
looked up, the expenditures for highways are found to have been as follows:
-P-A-G-E-152
140 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
Expenditures on Highways in the United States, 1918-22 
Year Amount 
1918 $286,101,198 
1919 389,455,932 
1920-21 700,000,000 
1992 976,000,000 
Total $2,351,557,130 
These figures, compiled from various sources, have been furnished by the New 
York Public Library. On this basis, few taxpayers will be willing to vote for the 
assumption of the accrued liabilities for a national teachers pension system by the 
Federal government, even if the liabilities need be met entirely not at once, but in the 
next sixty years. 
The question whether the Federal government should assume the accrued liabil- 
ities of the teachers retirement systems of the several states of the Union presents 
certain other phases which call for very brief discussion, touching the right of teach- 
ers to Federal aid, the political results involved, and the expediency of a request of 
this sort at the present time. 
One of the fundamental tenets of pension theory is that responsibility for provi- 
sion for old age rests jointly upon employer and employee. Now the Federal govern- 
ment is in no wise, directly or indirectly, the employer of the teacher in the public 
school. To the argument that the teachers’ activities benefit the whole nation, it may 
be replied that so also do the activities of the employees of museums, libraries, mu- 
nicipal theatres, and state universities, the judges of local, county, and state courts— 
the list is endless. It can only be concluded that a teacher in a public school has no 
more right to a Federal pension than a city magistrate. At present the state is the 
unit held responsible for the retirement of its teachers, just as it is responsible for 
education within its borders. 
That the political results of such agitation as this report proposes will be tinged 
with evil, in exactly the measure to which it is used for the acquisition of power under 
the ballot, is inevitable. Teachers, men and women, may be expected to vote for the 
candidate who promises his support to the scheme which will directly benefit them. 
This fact will encourage the use of the vote to advance private interests in a degree 
unparalleled except in connection with Civil War pensions and the soldiers bonus. 
Indeed, the proposition that the Federal government should assume the accrued lia- 
bilities of state teachers pension systems would encourage the formation of another 
bloc in Congress in support of what amounts essentially to another proposal of a 
Federal teachers bonus. From the point of view of national politics, therefore, the 
results of a scheme of this nature would be entirely undesirable. 
In the third place, even the most determined advocates of this step must realize 
that at present any agitation which looks to the increase of Federal expenditure, and 
therefore of taxation, will be unwelcome to the great body of citizens. This is not the
-P-A-G-E-153
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 141 
time to begin a campaign of education to accomplish such an end. The proposal is 
therefore untimely. But because the essential facts and features of the whole question 
are indubitably misconceived in some minds, perhaps expediency would be best served 
if the matter were to be brought up now, scotched, and even killed. 
In so far, then, as the Association conducts an impartial enquiry into the question 
of Federal aid for teachers pensions, its results may possibly be of value. But repre- 
senting as it does an interested party to the enquiry, it must be constantly on guard 
against the enticements which such a plan offers to persons not wholly disinterested. 
Furthermore, the Oakland-San Francisco report, in so far as it advocates Federal aid, 
prejudices the decision. The more recently constituted Committee of One Hundred 
on Pensions will therefore be an extremely influential factor in any decision to which 
the studies undertaken by the Association may lead. 
Pensions Committee, National Education Association 
The results of a year’s work on the part of the Pensions Committee of the Asso- 
ciation are in part anticipated by the publication in June, 1924, of a provisional 
statement of principles, which is, by and large, one of the most promising pronounce- 
ments of recent years on the subject of teachers retirement in the public schools. 
“The Committee”—so runs the introductory statement—“believes that a sound 
and adequate retirement plan is an essential part of every public school system.” 
Upon each of the principles advanced certain comment may be made; hence the eleven 
sections are quoted below as published, and to each is attached such comment as it 
seems to warrant: 
“1, Becinners To BE Exempr— During the beginning years while young teach- 
ers have not permanently allied themselves with the profession, participation in 
the annuity plan should be optional; beyond a specified age (twenty-five, for 
example) it should be required.” 
The proposal that teachers who have not yet decided upon teaching as a life-work 
should not be compelled to join a retirement system is somewhat new as applied 
to the public schools, although it has been for a time in force in colleges and uni- 
versities which contribute to jointly purchased annuities for their instructors. As re- 
gards the public schools, it is probably just as desirable and just as expedient. Only 
a few of the younger men and women who enter the profession ever intend to make 
teaching their life-work, and only a few more think seriously through the matter. 
Teaching is not infrequently regarded merely as an employment ad interim, a way 
station on the road to some other calling. Yet the plea of expediency should not be 
allowed to blind the student of retirement systems to the fact that it is the steady 
and long accumulation of small sums that builds up an adequate foundation for the 
retiring allowance. With this in mind, it is apparent that there is something to be 
said in favor of compulsory membership for the beginning teacher. Perhaps the pro-  
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
vision for optional membership up to the age at which compulsory participation 
begins offers, to the young teacher who enters seriously into the profession as a life- 
work, a sufficient safeguard. 
“2. Karty Reriremenr—Teachers leaving the service before the regular 
retirement age should retain their rights to all monies accumulated in their 
accounts. Teachers’ deposits should be withdrawable on demand upon retirement 
from teaching service. The public’s deposits should be withdrawable in the form 
of an annuity only upon reaching the retirement age.” 
The working out of the provision that the teacher’s deposits should be withdraw- 
able on demand if the teacher leaves the profession, shows that there are two sides 
to the matter. On the one hand, in strict theory, these deposits, representing the 
teacher’s deferred pay, should be available in such a contingency for immediate use. 
On the other hand, the practical operation of such a provision is not always happy. 
For instance, in one state it has been found that the immediate cash payment has 
led to abuses, and that the withdrawal provision has been used practically as a loan 
privilege. A teacher who wanted an automobile or a trip to Europe has in not a few 
cases withdrawn from teaching, and from the retirement system, in order to obtain 
the refund dué, in one cash payment. Later, the teacher was discovered to be once 
more teaching in the public schools of the state when her name was picked up from 
the check lists accompanying the monthly remittances from a different school board. 
To meet such contingencies, the retirement committee now pays to the withdrawing 
teacher the accumulations and interest in four equal quarterly instalments. This set 
of facts provides one more illustration of the principle that such regulations as this 
ought to be devised and adapted to suit conditions as they develop in particular 
states, Certainly the accumulations should be available at any time, but probably only 
in the form of an annuity, which could be intermitted, and for which the accumula- 
tions could be commenced again, if the teacher reéntered the profession after a with- 
drawal which turns out to be merely temporary. Such an arrangement as this would 
assuredly be the most convenient for that migration which it is advisable to encour- 
age from state to state. 
“3, Disazrtiry— An adequate retirement allowance should be provided for 
every permanently disabled teacher, regardless of the amount in her account at 
the time of such disability.” 
A statement that the disability allowance is to be provided without reference to 
the teacher’s account is misleading and dangerous. A retirement system must recog- 
nize that, inasmuch as the public had expended already a considerable sum in the 
training of the teacher and the first years of a teacher’s service are of the nature of 
an apprenticeship, a certain length of time should be fixed before a teacher, whether 
or not a member of the retirement system, should be eligible for disability benefits, 
otherwise it is simply opening its books as a charitable institution at the taxpayers’
-P-A-G-E-155
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 143 
expense. A disability allowance should be based partly, at least, upon the joint con- 
tributions of teacher and public and wholly upon a recognized disability table, speci- 
fied in the statute. Initial and, later, periodical medical examinations before a board 
of medical referees constitute a sine qua non of such a provision. No pension system 
can be made to cover every exigency of life except at a cost beyond the ability of the 
teacher. 
“4. GUARANTEES OF A RETIREMENT SystEM To TEACHERS AND TO THE PuBLic— 
Retirement ages and rules should be so defined and administered as to retain 
teachers during efficient service and provide for their retirement when satisfac- 
tory service is no longer possible. The retirement annuity should be sufficient to 
enable the retiring teacher to live in comfort, thereby removing the temptation 
to remain in the schools beyond the period of efficient service.” 
The intent of this section is evidently sound, but the interests of teachers will 
never be adequately safeguarded until two omissions are repaired: First, a contract 
should be provided, and a section to cover this essential should be written into the 
retirement act. 
Secondly, the name of a specific table of mortality among annuitants and the rate 
of interest on accumulations should be included in the statute. These two provisions 
are paramount among guarantees to any body of teachers. 
“5, Deatu Benerrrs—Sums accumulated in the accounts of teachers who die 
in service and unused portions of the accounts of retired teachers should be paid 
either to designated beneficiaries or to the estates of such teachers.” 
If the intention is to include in the “ sums accumulated” the amounts deposited 
by the teacher and by the employer, the provision is sound. The best systems pro- 
vide that all these accumulations shall be paid if the teacher dies before retirement 
takes place. Furthermore, they provide at least three options at retirement: (1) An 
annuity for life, whether long or short ; in case of death under this option, there is 
no cash remainder, and the sums remaining after early death balance and provide 
those sums which are needed for lives longer than the statistical expectation. (2) A 
life annuity for the teacher, to be followed by a life annuity of the same or of a dif- 
ferent amount for a widow or some other designated beneficiary. (3) A life annuity 
for the teacher, with the guarantee of a certain number of payments, representing 
the remaining accumulations, even though the teacher should not live long enough to 
receive them all himself. The second and third of these options necessarily make the 
annual sums paid on account of the life annuity smaller than those possible under 
the first option, but they are provided in order to meet the needs of teachers with 
dependents. Herein seems to lie one of the main differences in the contingencies to 
be covered by retirement systems for teachers and those for workers in industry. 
“6, Inprvipvat Accounts — The annuity board should open an account with 
each individual teacher and sums deposited in that account by the teacher and 
by the public should be held in trust for that teacher.”
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
This statement sets forth a principle which is sound for the period during which 
accumulations take place. After retirement, of course, the funds must be pooled, and 
some of the money accumulated by and for teachers who die early provides for the 
teachers who die later. This fact is one of the reasons why under a sound retirement 
system such options as have been outlined are possible at all. 
“7, Ricuts uNpER Previous Annurry Sysrems Sarecuarpep— The public 
should guarantee active teachers all the benefits which they had a reasonable 
right to expect under the old system and retired teachers the annuity promised 
at the time of retirement.” 
This is thoroughly sound doctrine, but it is difficult to carry out. Certainly all 
teachers in receipt of allowances should have them continued unimpaired. It is pos- 
sible, however, that few states will be willing, and some will be unable, to provide 
the funds to fulfil the promises of their old, unsound systems for teachers who have 
not retired, or approached at all nearly the age for retirement, when the new, sound 
system is inaugurated. 
“8. Crepir ror Pasr Servick wHERE No Retirement System Has Existep— 
Upon the adoption of a retirement plan, where none has existed, teachers should 
be given credit for their entire period of service. The new system should provide 
for annual additions to a fund for this purpose.” 
Such a provision is as highly desirable as it is difficult and expensive to secure. 
Even if this requirement cannot be met, it is inequitable to prevent proper provision 
for the teachers now entering into seryice because teachers who entered heretofore 
could not or did not secure such provision for themselves. Colleges which adopt con- 
tractual plans for retiring allowances usually contribute equally for all their teachers, 
with the statement that they will do whatever they can for older teachers if at the 
time of their retirement their accumulations are not adequate. The Massachusetts 
Pension Commission is now engaged upon an enquiry which was rendered necessary 
because such a group of former teachers were overlooked. 
“9. Cosr ro TracHERs aND Pustic—The sums deposited by the teachers 
and by the public over a long period of teaching service should be approximately 
equal.” 
To fix the amount deposited by the public at an easily calculated percentage of 
the salary, simplifies accounting. There would seem to be no really sound reason why 
the amount deposited by teacher and public should vary, except possibly a certain 
specious economy; the saving, if any, in cash will be paid for by the forfeiture of cer- 
tain privileges, perhaps of tenure, perhaps of some other sort, which may affect the 
flexibility of the system, or even its soundness. There are no two ways about it; for 
a sound retirement system, or indeed for any retirement system, some one must pay. 
When the expenses of superannuation are shared equally by teacher and public, both 
parties to the contract meet their social obligations fairly and unequivocally.
-P-A-G-E-157

“10. Service anv Deposrrs Concurrent — Deposits in the annuity account 
of each teacher should be made by the teacher and by the public regularly and 
concurrently during the period of service.” 
This statement proposes a very sound principle, but only the most enlightened 
teachers retirement systems are operating upon it, and certain arguments against it 
are difficult to meet. From the point of view of the public, the fairness of each year’s 
taxpayers meeting their own obligations as respects superannuation when these ob- 
ligations are initially incurred can scarcely be questioned, though legislators do not 
always see their way clear to apply the principle involved. Unless a provision for 
regular and concurrent deposits is written into the retirement act, teachers will find 
themselves more or less at the mercy of the inevitably changing character and tem- 
per of future legislative bodies which vote the necessary appropriations. 
“11. Amount or Depostrs Fixep—The deposit to be made in the teacher’s 
individual account by the teacher and by the public should be fixed in the organic 
act creating the annuity system.” 
This provision is entirely sound. 
Thus it may be said that the later work of the Pensions Committee of the Asso- 
ciation contains much more to commend it than the report printed in the Proceed- 
ings of the Oakland-San Francisco meeting of 1923. If from the principles just dis- 
cussed it may be inferred that the Committee has abandoned the erroneous notion 
that the Federal government has any just responsibility for the retirement of teach- 
ers in the several states, the Committee is to be congratulated. If, on the contrary, 
the movement for Federal doles — and it amounts practically to that —has merely 
been postponed until the demand for teachers retirement systems shall have become 
universal throughout the nation, then the activities of the Committee must be com- 
mended with reservations. It is to be hoped, however, that the National Education 
Association will continue to lend its support to sound proposals and principles, leav- 
ing the unsound to sink into the limbo of causes which had best be forgotten. 
The more important and fundamental principles involved in the Committee’s state- 
ments were included or foreshadowed in the work of the National Education Asso- 
ciation Committee on Salaries, Pensions, and Tenure for 1917-18, of which Dr. 
Joseph Swain, then President of Swarthmore College and now a member of the Com- 
mittee of One Hundred, was chairman. The findings of this earlier Committee are 
summarized in the Preface to Bulletin Twelve of this Foundation, Pensions for Pub- 
lic School Teachers, and with them “'The Social Philosophy of Pensions,” as set forth 
in the body of the bulletin, is in entire accord. In view of the revived activity on the 
part of the Association with respect to pensions and retirement for public school 
teachers, a rather more precise statement of the nature of a sound retirement system 
is pertinent.

  146 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
A Sounp Retirement System 
The growing interest in superannuation and its problems on the part of teachers 
and of those who are responsible for the conduct of the public schools leads to an 
increasing number of enquiries as to what constitutes a sound system for the retire- 
ment of teachers. The attempt to formulate the principles upon which such a system 
must be based involves the use of a few technical terms, but there is nothing for- 
midable in them; nor need there be in a law which embodies the principles. Moreover, 
the essentials of a retirement system for teachers can be adapted to the needs of pub- 
lic employees of all classes and, within certain limitations, of industrial employees 
as well, though in industry some modification seems to be desirable with respect to 
financing. 
When the inauguration of a retirement system is contemplated, the first step is 
to determine the basis on which retirement shall take place. For teachers, the condi- 
tions of retirement should include provision against old age and provision against 
disability. On the basis of age, an age for normal retirement should be fixed, but 
provisions should be made for earlier or later retirement in any case agreed upon 
between employer and teacher. A service provision may be added, but it should be 
subordinated to age. A benefit based upon service alone, irrespective of age or dis- 
ability, cannot be recommended. On the basis of disability, an allowance may be 
commenced at any time agreed upon by employer and teacher. 
As regards the amount of the allowance for superannuation, the principles are 
comparatively simple. The sums contributed annually by employer and teacher, ac- 
cumulated at compound interest, the rate having been agreed upon at the begin- 
ning of the contributions, should be applied at retirement to the purchase of an an- 
nuity based upon a specified table of mortality and a rate of interest agreed upon at 
the beginning of contributions. The form of annuity or deferred annuity should be 
so chosen at retirement as to cover the life of the annuitant alone, or to cover his life 
and that of his widow, or to guarantee the return of any contributions remaining 
after the death of the annuitant. 
Employer and teacher make equal contributions, in any annual sum initially agreed 
upon. Contributions are preferably a percentage of the salary as fixed at the begin- 
ning of the contributions, which, accumulated for the normal period of service, will 
provide upon retirement an annuity at least half as large as the initial salary. Since 
contributions represent a fixed percentage of salary, they will provide a sum which 
increases in proportion to increases in salary; and thereby the prospective allowances 
will be proportionally augmented. In general, five per cent of the salary from both 
employer and teacher respectively will provide a sum adequate for retirement, but 
additional contributions may be made by employer or teacher, or by both. These 
additions are desirable if contribution is begun later than the time of normal entrance 
into service, and they may be made to secure additional protection for disability, as
-P-A-G-E-159
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 147 
agreed upon at the beginning of contributions. All contributions should becredited in- 
dividually and used only for the account of the teacher by and for whom they are made. 
In case of death or withdrawal from service before retirement, it is in general 
desirable to return to the former teacher all of his contributions and also those of 
the employer, with interest as originally agreed upon. On the other hand, the funda- 
mental purpose of a retirement system is to provide allowances against old age and 
disability. In any system in which the contributions of the teacher are matched by 
the employer, at compound interest, there is likely to be an inclination to regard 
the total accumulations to the credit of a teacher as if they were deposits in a savings 
bank, to be drawn against as need, real or fancied, arises. On this account, with the 
fundamental purposes of a retirement system in mind, it is reasonable to safeguard 
the interests of the employer— in reality, the taxpayer—to the extent of providing 
that a teacher who transfers from one school system to another may take with him 
his own contributions and those of his employer; but that, if he withdraws from 
teaching and enters upon other employment, he shall receive only his own contribu- 
tions, with interest as provided at the beginning of his membership in the system. 
All these provisions should be made contractual, especially those governing disa- 
bility. Thus the employer may be assured in advance that the cost of the system will 
never exceed a definite percentage of the salary budget, and the teacher may know 
exactly what he shall pay and what he will receive. Such precision and security are 
provided by the annuity contracts of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Associa- 
tion of America and the Annuity Fund for Congregational Ministers, the Old Age 
Pension Bond of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and the Annuity Policy 
of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. 
Accrued liabilities are amounts which would have been accumulated, had contri- 
butions been made by and for all teachers since their entrance into service. Although 
to place older teachers on the same basis as younger is almost impossibly expensive, 
some additional contribution for them is both desirable and expedient. The most 
practicable plan seems to be to determine the amount that would be necessary to 
make up all back contributions and accumulations; collect as much of this as possi- 
ble; and distribute it, or its annual interest, among the annuity accounts of the older 
teachers in accordance with their relative status. 
Finally, the teachers should have representation on whatever board administers 
their contributions in the funds, in so far as the laws of the state will permit. 
Txacuers RETIREMENT IN THE SEVERAL SraTEs 
It has been said that the legislation affecting the retirement of teachers enacted 
during the year has bulked very small if the objects set forth by the National Edu- 
cation Association are to be attained. Yet in a number of states, teachers and others 
have been discussing the possibilities of securing sound provisions; in Georgia, Indi-  
-P-A-G-E-160
  148 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
ana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Texas, 
and Virginia, interest has been displayed in varying degrees, but to what may be 
regarded as a common end. For instance, in Indiana, and especially in Indianapolis, 
there has been much earnest discussion and endeavor to amend an unsound system, 
but the results are deferred. In Louisiana, dissatisfaction has been manifested with the 
law setting up a pension system for Orleans Parish, which was enacted in 1910 and 
amended in 1914 and 1918. Here, a total contribution of five per cent, of which 
three per cent is paid by the school and two by the teacher, was reckoned to be suffi- 
cient to pay a retiring allowance of one-half the average annual salary for the five 
years preceding retirement, but with a lower limit of $300 and an upper of $600. 
The average allowance paid is $425, and the last Annual Report of the system shows 
that it is impossible under the provisions to increase the benefits. In Maryland, it is 
becoming apparent that a law which restricts the number of teacher-pensioners to 
200, when 230 more are in need of the benefits of the system, is not sound. In Mis- 
souri, endeavors on the part of teachers and of certain public-spirited citizens to estab- 
lish a sound retirement system were temporarily stopped by a provision in the State 
Constitution which has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State as pro- 
hibiting the use of state moneys for such a purpose. This does not in any way detract 
from the generosity of Mr. William Volker, of Kansas City, who is reported on No- 
vember 2, 1923, to have offered the sum of $50,000 to found a Teachers Saving and 
Retirement Fund upon a plan proposed some years ago. Teachers and certain citi- 
zens of St. Louis have also been active in canvassing the field. The only discourag- 
ing feature in the Missouri situation is that the proposed amendments to the State 
Constitution submitted to popular vote early in 1924 contained no clause bearing 
upon the prohibiting provision. In Montana, questions have been raised concerning 
the actuarial solvency of the state system. There, teachers contribute one dollar a 
month up to a total of $300, and retirement is possible after twenty-five years of 
service, of which fifteen must have been spent in the state. Thus a teacher might 
retire at age 45, or even at age 42, to draw $600 per year for twenty or even forty 
years. It would seem as if the questions about actuarial solvency were amply justified. 
In Newark, New Jersey, a plan for group health and accident insurance has been 
proposed by teachers in the public schools. More important, however, was an act 
passed in 1924 (House Bill 451) by the New Jersey Legislature, which extends the 
benefits of the State Employees Retirement System, erected in 1921, to the employees 
of those counties and municipalities which desire to contribute toward their super- 
annuation. The new law, inasmuch as it does not apply to policemen, firemen, and 
other employees contributing to other pension funds, is a just and important exten- 
sion of a state system into what may be called a field of local option in retirement. 
In Texas, certain teachers are reported as favoring an unfunded, non-contributory 
pension system, though the State Teachers Association is said to be moving more 
cautiously toward a sounder enactment. One interesting argument for the funding of
-P-A-G-E-161
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 149 
a state’s contributions to a teachers retirement fund is to be noted in Rhode Island, 
where in June, 1924, quarterly payments of nearly $20,000 were reported to have 
been held up bya filibuster in the legislature which delayed all appropriation bills. 
Considering, finally, the discussion during the last two years concerning the Public 
School Teachers Retirement Salary Fund of California, the following sentence from 
the ten-year report of the Board, dated June 30, 1924, is interesting: “It is the im- 
pression of those in charge that the fund eventually will have to be revised, but that 
we have not yet had enough experience to show just what should be done, and that 
it is not wise to hurry about making a change, since the fund will evidently run on 
for a number of years before the expenditures will exceed the income.” All indica- 
tions are to the effect that the misgivings of the Board are well founded. However 
new may be the theory and practice of teachers retirement, and however meagre may 
have been the actuarial data gathered for the recent investigation of the fund, the 
resources of the system have been tried in the balance and found wanting. 
Mobile County, Alabama 
One of the most questionable enactments of recent years is the pension law ap- 
proved September 4, 1923, applying to counties of from 80,000 to 150,000 popu- 
lation, and aimed especially at the County of Mobile, Alabama. This act provides 
that a teacher sixty years of age with thirty years service, who is “without the means 
of comfortable support,” may on application be placed upon a Retired List and be 
paid from the county school fund a pension up to $360 per year, as long as the 
teacher is indigent. All payments are to be “for some service performed,” and the 
county board may assign duties to the retired teacher. One of the worst features of 
the law is a clause to the effect that the “public school authorities . . . may for any 
reason which they deem sufficient, discontinue payment completely.” Surely, it would 
be difficult to find a darker piece of pension legislation in recent years. 
Towa 
During February, 1923, a bill was introduced into the Iowa State Legislature to 
establish a state-wide retirement system forteachers, which showed many resemblances 
to the retirement systems of the State of New York and of New York City. The age 
for voluntary retirement was fixed at 55, with compulsory retirement at age 70. 
The retiring allowance was to be based upon the average salary for the last ten years 
of the teacher’s service in the public schools. An initial levy of one dollar per mem- 
ber was to take care of expenses; but, in case they should exceed the sum so pro- 
vided, the State should make up the balance. Disability and death benefits, a scale 
of contributions with variations for different ages, and reserve funds for various pur- 
poses were among the features of the bill. On the whole, the proposal was fairly 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
150 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
typical of that class of pension legislation which is framed more or less ready-made 
by actuaries, and not the least objectionable of its features was the fallacy of basing 
the pension upon the final average salary, which cannot be determined in advance. 
The bill, however, seems not to have progressed out of committee. Probably it re- 
ceived no really critical consideration to an extent sufficient to bring out an opinion 
on the provision of final average salary. 
In the spring of 1924 a resolution was introduced into the State House of Rep- 
resentatives proposing that the next General Assembly should pass an amendment 
to the State Constitution, which should prohibit the enacting of pension legislation 
without the consent of the people, given by vote. It is said that this measure was 
aimed to prevent the enactment of any measures affecting teachers retirement. In 
support it was urged that the retirement provisions of the city of Des Moines draw 
teachers from the smaller towns into that city to such an extent as to embarrass those 
towns which have no such provisions of their own. If this statement fairly represents 
the conditions, then it is one of the best arguments in recent years for the enactment 
by the whole state of sound retirement legislation. 
Minneapolis 
The retirement system for the city of Minneapolis, which was commented upon 
in the Eighteenth Annual Report of this Foundation, went into operation on Jan- 
uary 1, 1924. The plan fulfils some of the requirements of a sound pension system, 
in that it represents an attempt to devise a joint-contributory plan on a reserve 
basis; provides representation of teachers on the administrative board, periodical 
actuarial valuations, individual accounts for members, options, and withdrawal bene- 
fits; safeguards the investment of the funds; and undertakes to meet the accrued lia- 
bilities. On the other hand, it fails to meet the standards of the best retirement sys- 
tems as regards simplicity. An excellent illustration of the complexity which is from 
every point of view as undesirable as it is unnecessary in a teachers retirement plan 
is found in Article VIII (4), which runs as follows: 
“The City will deposit in the retirement deposit fund on behalf of every mem- 
ber as a city deposit an amount equal to the following percentage of the com- 
pensation for service as a senior teacher during the fiscal year on which required 
deposits were made by the member, namely; 
“to one and one-half per cent add one-fourth of one per cent for each year 
of teaching experience credited to the member at the beginning of the fiscal 
year, and deduct one-twentieth of one per cent for each one hundred dollars 
of such compensation received during the year in excess of two thousand dol- 
lars, provided that the total shall not exceed nine per cent of such compensa- 
tion received during the fiscal year, and provided, that any such compensation 
received during any fiscal year in excess of three thousand dollars, shall be 
disregarded in computing and applying the above percentage.
-P-A-G-E-163
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 151 
“Provided, however, that if the above percentages of city deposits together 
with the amount—one hundred forty thousand dollars annually for a period 
of fifty years—needed to amortize the liabilities of the association under the 
present articles of incorporation shall exceed an amount which will require a tax 
levy of more than one mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation of Minne- 
apolis during the years 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927, and thereafter until 
a higher tax rate has been authorized by an amendment to these articles of in- 
corporation, then, and in that event, the percentages of city deposits shall be 
reduced to such an extent and in such amounts that one mill on each dollar of 
the assessed valuation of the taxable property of the city of Minneapolis will 
produce revenues sufficient to amortize the present liabilities under the articles 
of incorporation now in force, and provide a fund that will be sufficient to meet 
the liabilities for that year, and provided further that when the city deposits 
with interest accumulations in favor of a member shall have reached the sum of 
six thousand six hundred and sixty-six dollars ($6,666.00) the city’s deposits 
shall cease; provided, however, that present annuitants are guaranteed full an- 
nuities as provided under the articles, by-laws and rules as the same were in effect 
immediately preceding the taking effect of this article.” 
Before a teacher or taxpayer will be able to deduce the amount of a pension under 
this provision, he will probably be ready for retirement. The plan, in short, repre- 
sents one more excursion of the actuary into the field of the pension expert. 
New York City 
Certain events of the past year bearing upon the New York City Teachers Retire- 
ment System have again demonstrated the fundamental unsoundness of provisions 
for paying retiring allowances based upon a final average salary. The weakness of 
such provisions has been set forth, in general, in several previous annual reports of 
the Foundation, especially the Twelfth and the Seventeenth, and, in particular, dur- 
ing the discussion of the New York City System before its enactment, but attempts to 
patch up the system still continue. Of the various bills introduced into the New York 
State Legislature few details need be given, nor need their history be traced minutely. 
It is perhaps sufficient to note some of the objects aimed at and the end of the 
agitation for the time being. 
The so-called Farrell-Taylor Bill, which was similar in effect to a measure vetoed 
last year by the Mayor of the city because the costs were unknown, called for an amend- 
ment to the charter of Greater New York which would have provided for teachers re- 
tiring allowances computed on the basis of the average salary earned during the last 
five years of service, instead of the last ten years, as the charter at present specifies. 
The effect of such a measure would have been a large increase in the amounts paid 
to teachers who retired in the next few years, because of the rise in salaries which 
came in 1920 under the Lockwood-Donohue law. Another measure, known as the 
Love-Coughlin Bill, was designed to make retirement possible after thirty years of  
-P-A-G-E-164
    152 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
service, instead of thirty-five, as the present law provides. This bill, like the Farrell- 
Taylor Bill, had been introduced into the previous session of the Legislature and had 
also failed to become a law. 
Not long after agitation for these measures had begun, their proponents recog- 
nized that very little could be hoped for without some estimate of the costs involved 
in the changes, and an appeal was made to the Board of Retirement of the New York 
Teachers Retirement System. The Board had no funds at its disposal for such a pur- 
pose. The actuary of the system gave estimates of the probable cost of a survey, if 
made by some one else. At last it was decided that the teachers of the city should col- 
lect a sum of money for the task, and Mr. John S. Thompson, Assistant Actuary of 
the Mutual Life Insurance Company, and Secretary of the Actuarial Society of Amer- 
ica, not the actuary of the Board, was selected to do the work. The Retirement Board 
gave Mr. Thompson permission to use its records, and Mr. Thompson, completing 
the survey in a creditably short time, rendered his report on February 29, 1924. The 
details of the report may be briefly summarized: Both changes would cost more than 
the present provisions. The amendment for the five-year average salary would be rela- 
tively inexpensive to the teachers; in many cases it would have involved not more 
than one-tenth of the present rate of contribution. To the city the cost for “present 
teachers” alone was estimated to be in excess of $6,000,000. On the other hand the 
thirty-year retirement plan was estimated to cost the city $21,600,000, and to 
operate the two amendments together, Mr. Thompson estimated, would demand 
$29,579,845. Upon receiving the report and presenting it in printed form to the 
teachers of the city, the Committee very properly considered that its work was ended. 
It made no recommendations and introduced no legislation; it left all the associa- 
tions represented upon it free to take such action as they saw fit. The result was the 
agitation by certain organizations for the passage of one or both of the bills. 
The Love-Coughlin Bill died in Committee. The Farrell-Taylor Bill passed both 
houses of the Legislature, but was vetoed by Governor Alfred E. Smith, not because 
of the expense involved, but on legal grounds. In the veto message Governor Smith 
declared in effect, that since the bill related to the “property, affairs, or government” 
of the City of New York, it could not be passed “except on message from the gov- 
ernor declaring that emergency exists and the concurrent action of two-thirds of the 
members of each house of the legislature.” 
As far as the theory of teachers retirement is concerned, the gist of the matter seems 
to be that the defects of the New York City system are due not alone to the fallacy 
of the final average salary in theory and practice, but also to the fact that the plan, 
through this and other failures to meet the hopes of those persons who are to ben- 
efit from it, is of necessity subject to patchwork attempts to remedy real or seeming 
defects, inequalities, and favoritisms, which breed continuous dissatisfactions. Gov- 
ernor Smith is of the opinion that under the pension laws of the state special priv- 
ilege has no place. In order, therefore, that the whole question of pensions in New
-P-A-G-E-165
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 153 
York State may be authoritatively studied, he has directed the State Pension Com- 
mission to investigate the subject, to clarify it as regards state and local control, 
and to unify and standardize pension practice in the State. 
The system is defective in still another respect, namely, as regards options, and 
especially the options available under the provisions governing retirement for disa- 
bility. The crux of the matter is that, as the official Circular of Information puts it, 
“the death of a contributor after retirement leaves no benefit unless secured by some 
option selected at retirement.” Contributors with ten or more years of service in the 
city are therefore urged by certain organizations to file an option early, thus to be 
ready to take advantage of any disability that may occur, and to keep on hand an 
“ Application Blank for Disability Retirement,” filled up and accessible for filing at 
short notice by the teacher himself or by some interested party or dependent. The 
contributor is then ready to get all that the law allows, and to retire as soon as an 
emergency arises. Under Option I, “if he die before he has received in payments the 
present value of his annuity, his pension, or his retirement allowance, as it was at 
the time of his retirement, the balance shall be paid to his legal representatives or 
to such person, having an insurable interest in his life, as he shall nominate by writ- 
ten designation duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement board at the time 
of his retirement.” If the contributor is “stricken with an illness or should meet with 
an accident and if [his] physician thinks there is any possibility of death resulting,” 
the only safe thing to do is to retire at once for disability, so that his beneficiary may 
reap the rewards of the city’s generosity in case the contributor dies. This situation 
has given rise to many so-called “death-bed” retirements. 
Not satisfied with the present provision of the law, which is administered liber- 
ally even to the limits of prodigality, certain enthusiasts for easy retirement had in- 
troduced into the state legislature of 1922-23 a bill which, if it had become a law, 
would have required every policeman to carry on his person blank applications for 
disability retirement, so that any eligible teacher who was injured or taken ill on 
the streets of the city might retire without the inconvenience or delay of going home, 
simply by signifying such a desire to the nearest policeman, who was then required 
to leave his post and file the application. Such a provision as this would have made 
even “death-bed retirement” relatively unattractive. 
In March, 1924, examiners of the State Insurance Department, reporting upon 
various affairs connected with the system, paid some attention to this matter of 
“death-bed retirement,” which, they are quoted as saying, “cannot be too strongly 
condemned,” on the ground that it permits beneficiaries rather than members to draw 
on the funds. They suggested that to the evil one of two remedies be applied: either 
that a waiting period of one month between application for disability retirement and 
the actual retirement be required, or that options be made available only upon su- 
perannuation; “so long as options may be chosen at any time before retirement, with 
benefits as at present, there will be selections on the part of teachers against the 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
154 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
system.” No doubt the contributors who have planned to avail themselves of these 
defects in the law will protest loudly against any attempt to safeguard the public 
interest, but it is to be hoped that the State Pension Commission in its investigation 
may draw attention to the matter with such force that some action may be taken. 
The law in a number of respects presents excellent illustrations of provisions which 
can never be included in a retirement system that is soundly conceived. 
Tracuers RETIREMENT IN ENGLAND 
If further warning were needed against the establishment of retirement systems 
without due regard to the facts of actuarial science, no better case could be found at 
the present time than the situation in England as this is expounded in the Report — 
of the Departmental Committee on the Superannuation of School Teachers, dated 
July 30, 1923. The Committee, constituted August 22, 1922, by Treasury minute, 
consisted of Lord Emmott, President of the Association of Technical Institutions, 
Chairman; Lord Kenyon, President of North Wales University College; Sir Michael 
E. Sadler, Chairman of the Teachers’ Registration Council; Sir Alfred W. Watson, 
Actuary; Sir John Struthers, Secretary of the Scottish Education Department, who 
upon resignation was succeeded by Sir G. Macdonald, First Assistant Secretary of 
the Scottish Education Department; Miss S. Margery Fry, and Messrs. Hugh R. 
Rathbone, W. L. Hichens, Duncan C. Fraser, G. C. Upcott, and H. J. Simmonds, 
with Mr. R. U. Knox of the Treasury as Secretary. To this Committee Miss Margaret 
J. Tuke, Principal of Bedford College, London, was added on November 18, 1922. 
The death of Sir Albert J. Hobson on April 20, 1923, deprived the Committee of 
his advice on the problems concerned in the relation of university service and the 
Federated Superannuation System for Universities, which had been framed largely 
under his personal guidance. Messrs. Rathbone, Upcott, and Simmonds signed the re- 
port with certain reservations respecting the inclusion of school inspectors and or- 
ganizers employed by local education authorities within the terms of a School Teach- 
ers Superannuation Act, on the ground of the resulting additional charge upon the 
Exchequer. 
The vexed and complicated history of teachers pensions in England has been the 
subject of more than one reference in the Annual Reports of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion. From 1846 until 1898 there were awarded to teachers in England and Wales 
very small pensions, latterly known as “ Code” grants.! These grants, which came 
from the Exchequer at the discretion of the central authority, were comparatively 
trifling in amount; the largest was only £30 per year, and about 1906 they ceased 
to be awarded at all. The Elementary School Teachers (Superannuation) Act of 1898 
1 These facts are quoted and summarized from the Report of the Committee, Part 1, Sections 8-37. The Twelfth 
Bulletin of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, 1918, touches briefly upon teachers pensions 
in England, pages 17 and 18. More extended discussion will be found in Annual Reports of the Foundation, as fol- 
lows: the Fourteenth, pages 67-68 ; the Seventeenth, pages 141-143.  
-P-A-G-E-167

established a contributory system, with limited contributions of £3 for a man and 
£2 for a woman, which, after various rises under Treasury Warrant, were in 1912 
fixed by Parliament at £3 12s. and £2 8s., respectively, with a Deferred Annuity 
Fund built up from the teachers contributions and compound interest, and with pro- 
vision for an annual Superannuation Allowance, of the nature of a free gift from the 
Exchequer, fixed in 1912 at one pound for each year of contributory service plus 
certain small additions. The benefits were dependent not upon salaries, but upon 
service, and the cost to the Exchequer remained the same. Total maximum pensions 
paid under this Act came to about £90 for a man and £68 for a woman, sums which 
certainly represented the barest subsistence allowance. 
This Act, obviously unsatisfactory, was superseded by the Act of 1918, effective 
April, 1919. The Act of 1918 represented a jump into the fire. It abolished contri- 
butions and charged all benefits to the Exchequer. It based the computation of the 
pension upon salary, without any attempt to control the salaries paid by local au- 
thorities. It increased the number of potential pensioners to 70,000. Certainly this 
Act was most liberal to the teachers in granting them a gratuitous allowance for re- 
tirement, except that they and all other taxpayers were forced to pay for it. This 
fact seemingly meant little to the beneficiaries. Even the Board of Education was 
not especially concerned in its implications, if one is to judge from the published ver- 
sions of speeches by Mr. Herbert Fisher, its President, for the passage of the bill. As 
the matter was summarized in the Fourteenth Annual Report of the Foundation, 
the Act “violates all the principles that have been contributed to the subject by 
experience, actuarial science, and social philosophy.” 
Less than six months after the Act had become effective it became evident that 
the low salaries paid to school teachers in England demanded adjustment. The result 
was the constitution of the so-called Burnham Committees to deal with salary scales. 
The recommendations of these Committees, as adopted, multiplied the average sala- 
ries of individual teachers in 1914 to an amount nearly two and a half times as great 
in 1922. Now in 1913-14, the gross expenditure for the superannuation of teachers 
in England and Wales was £176,000 ; in 1918-19, £259,386; but for 1923-24, it was 
expected, because of the salary increases, to reach £2,400,000. Furthermore, if April 
1, 1924, were taken as the earliest date at which a new system could be introduced, 
“the Government Actuary calculated that of the £4,100,000 which will be required 
for 1928-29, only £100,000 will be for pensions paid in respect to ‘ future service.’ ” 
The implications of these figures require a strong emphasis. They are to the effect 
that the accrued liabilities arising from a pension system conferring gratuities based 
upon uncalculated, because inherently uncalculable, future salaries must,in the words 
of the report, “be an almost intolerable weight for any superannuation fund to 
carry.” This fact New South Wales discovered to her cost some twenty years ago. 
To judge from her experience, the Committee puts the case mildly. It is small won- 
der that, viewing the appalling costs of accrued liabilities, certain interested persons
-P-A-G-E-168

156 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
in the United States have shown a desire to shift their burden from the shoulders of 
the several states to the broad back of the Federal Treasury. One effective answer to 
their propaganda is this: it is certainly inexpedient for the United States to under- 
take a burden that neither New South Wales nor England has been able to bear. 
The fury of spending which succeeded the economies imposed by the World War 
stirred the British Government to name a Committee on National Expenditure, pre- 
sided over by Sir Eric Geddes. This Committee examined the Act of 1918, and in 
its First Interim report, 1922, recommended “that a full inquiry should be held 
with a view to placing the superannuation of teachers on a sound contributory basis 
under which the teachers and the authorities who employ them would each bear a 
due proportion of the burden.” Pending such an enquiry, on recommendation of this 
Committee Parliament voted, for the period from June 1, 1922, to June 1, 1924, 
that every teacher in “recognized ” service, who is eligible for benefits under the Act 
of 1918, should pay a contribution of five per cent of his salary in respect of super- 
annuation privileges. On this basis, the amount of the levy falls far short of the ac- 
tuarial value of the superannuation rights accruing year by year. Even more sinister 
is the fact that the proceeds of this levy are not being funded, but are being paid out 
currently on a cash-disbursement basis. Fortunately, the enquiry recommended by the 
Geddes Committee was entrusted to Lord Emmott’s Committee. Their labors were ar- 
duous, but in their report they have pointed the way to the solution of the difficulties. 
They recapitulate their recommendations under some nineteen heads. Of these 
some four or five deal with the details of service requirements which seem peculiarly 
English in their significance. The essential features of the system which they pro- 
pose are these: They would set up a joint contributory retirement plan for teachers 
with retirement, withdrawal, disability, and death benefits, with provisions for reci- 
procity between England and Scotland, between the schools and the Federated Super- 
annuation System for Universities, and between the proposed system and systems in 
other parts of the Empire, and without reductions of the liabilities already accrued 
on account of “back service,” the whole costs of which are to be borne by the State. 
A Central Superannuation Fund is created, to which the contributing parties are 
three: the teachers, who pay five per cent of their salaries; local authorities, who pay 
two and one-half per cent; and the State, which should “either (a) pay annually into 
the Fund a sum equal to the total contribution of local authorities and other gov- 
erning bodies of grant-aided schools or (6) pay as they arose one-fourth of all the 
charges which would otherwise have been met in full from the Fund... . In addi- 
tion, the state, besides bearing the whole expenses of administration, should guarantee 
the solvency of the fund during the intervals between the periodical valuations.” 
Membership would be compulsory. An Advisory Council is recommended for confi- 
dential discussion of broad questions of policy, though the fund and, it is supposed, 
the system would be under the administration of the Board of Education. Such a 
system, with the elasticity and adaptability provided by the Report, should present
-P-A-G-E-169
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 157 
a sound, acceptable, and beneficial substitute for the present chaos in the field of teach- 
ers superannuation in England. 
An echo of the Report is to be found in School Life for December, 1923, entitled 
“Favorable Pension System for British Teachers,” by Fred Tait. The article is some- 
what pessimistic in tone. No sooner had the Burnham Scales improved teachers sal- 
aries, than “the Geddes Committee suggested, in the name of economy, that the pen- 
sion scheme should be made contributory, and that 5 per cent should be deducted 
annually from teachers’ salaries for this purpose.” This provision the Emmott Report 
would continue. “While the report does not do all that the teachers hoped, especially 
in not recommending that the scheme be non-contributory, the National Union of 
Teachers has already declared that it is ‘an able report,’ and that with slight amend- 
ments it could be made the basis of a very just settlement of the vexed pension prob- 
lem.” Perhaps such short-sighted comments do not adequately represent the attitude 
of the British teacher. They are the reverberations of the old mendicant plea of Some- 
thing-for-Nothing, and they are put forth once more in the face of statistics actually 
quoted from the report. It is to be hoped that the majority of the world’s teachers 
have reached the point where doles and gratuities can be regarded only as an insult 
to their self-respect, and that vague and conditional grants promised from a public 
treasury can never again take the place of annuities adequately planned, soundly 
purchased, and contractually provided. : 
The Assistant Masters’ Association expressed itself as dissatisfied with the Emmott 
report. The Association, avowedly concerned for “the special interests of its mem- 
bers,” finds a contribution of five per cent of their salaries “obnoxious.” From the 
point of view of sociological or actuarial science, such objections are without founda- 
tion. But when the Association asks that the question of salaries be considered in 
connection with the question of retirement, and that all teachers, primary and sec- 
ondary, English, Welsh, and Scottish, and all schools, whether grant-aided or no, be 
treated equitably, it stands upon firmer ground. The temporary continuation of the 
Act of 1922, with its contributory features, objectionable though the Act may be in 
many other respects, will be less injurious in the long run than a defeat of the pro- 
posals of Lord Emmott’s Committee because of special pleading or impatience.

Australia 
Evidently taking warning from the rocks which once confronted New South Wales, 
Australia in 1922 passed a federal Superannuation Act which from its inception has 
kept clear of the reefs upon which her component commonwealth grounded. How 
many of the merits of the Australian system are due to excellence in actuarial guid- 
ance, it is impossible to state, but appearances indicate that the preéminent stability 
of the plan, as discussed in the first report, for the period ended June 30, 1923, is due  
-P-A-G-E-170
  158 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
in no small degree to the advanced state of actuarial science in the Commonwealth. 
Briefly stated, the provisions of the Superannuation Act, 1922, which became effec- 
tive on November 20 of that year, with contributions beginning on January 5, 1923, 
set up a joint-contributory retirement plan on the reserve basis, with superannuation, 
disability, and widows benefits, and with a unit of pension of £26 per annum, man- 
aged by a board of three persons, one of whom is appointed upon the nomination of 
the employees. Of these details the most interesting are those affecting the contribu- 
tions by the employee and the Commonwealth. 
The employee’s contributions are dependent actuarially upon the number of units, 
of £26 each, to which he is limited by a scale laid down in the Act, and which bears 
a direct relation to his salary. The minimum pension for which contribution can be 
made consists of two units, totaling £52 per annum, and the maximum, of sixteen 
units, or £416. Thus from the outset the amount of the benefit is fixed to bear a direct 
relation to salary. The difference between the definiteness of such initial provisions 
and the vaguenesses and futility of trying to base a system on percentages of final 
salary or “final average salary,” is the difference between day and abysmal night. In 
Australia the rates of contribution are dependent upon the age of the employee at 
the date he commences to contribute. The employee’s contributions are deducted from 
his salary as disbursed. In the case of an officer who remains in the service up to the 
maximum age of retirement, which is sixty-five years, his contributions cease on the 
anniversary of his initial payment next preceding his sixty-fifth birthday. In all other 
cases, an officer’s contributions terminate upon his separation from the service. An 
interesting feature of the Act, Section 14, is the rule that where an employee satis- 
fies the Board that adequate provision exists for himself and his family, the Board 
may exempt him from contributions for more than the minimum of two units; but 
the Board must be satisfied that such provision exists at the time of application, will 
be maintained during the period of contributions, and will be effective at the time 
of retirement. Though this feature may seem at first glance distinctly paternalistic, 
nevertheless on closer examination it seems reasonable and sound within the purpose 
of the Act. The Board’s rulings are to the effect that life insurance policies will not 
fulfil the requirements, because there is nothing to prevent their being surrendered 
or mortgaged. It is significant that for the most part objections to the rulings have 
come from officers who protest against the compulsory nature of the plan. 
The total number of employee contributors as of June 30, 1923, was 26,876. Of 
these, 7805 were contributing with respect to the minimum of two whole units; 
4454, with respect to two and one-half and three units; the largest number, 12,553, 
four units; 2011, from five to fifteen units; and 38 for the maximum of sixteen 
units. For fractions of units ranging from one-half unit to fourteen and a quarter 
units, fifteen contributors are listed. With regard to the distribution of contributors 
in salary groups, the first two groups, receiving salaries up to £156 a year, contain 
9513 contributors. The third group, with salaries ranging from £156 to £208, is
-P-A-G-E-171
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 159 
the largest, with 7134 contributors. Next in size stands the fourth group, on salaries 
between £208 and £260, with the second largest single body of contributors, 6231. 
The twelve other groups, members of which receive salaries from £260 to £832, are 
composed of 3998 contributors. As might naturally be expected, the plan serves best 
the employees on smaller salaries, perhaps because there are more of them to serve. 
The contributions by the united Commonwealth are reserved until the time of re- 
tirement. The advantages of this method are said to be two: “(a) That the accumu- 
lation of large sums of Commonwealth moneys in the Superannuation Fund, which 
would be invested for the most part in Commonwealth Securities, is avoided, the 
Commonwealth Public Account not being drawn upon until the pensions are actually 
payable; (6) From an actuarial standpoint, the Fund is equally well secured by the 
provisions of an Act of Parliament, under which the Commonwealth is committed to 
certain payments upon the retirement of officers, as it would be if provision were made 
for payment of Commonwealth moneys into the Fund at the same time that the em- 
ployee’s contributions are made. Neither form of commitment may be set aside ex- 
cepting by Act of Parliament.” The report continues: “Where employees contribute 
for units of pension as at rate for age, the pension is paid out of the Superannuation 
Fund, and a sum equal to half of the pension is paid by the Commonwealth to the 
Fund.” Such a policy guarantees solvency and perpetuity, in so far as the Common- 
wealth is solvent and perpetual, and on the purely financial side it can scarcely be 
objected to. On the ethical side, since pensions are deferred wages, it may be ques- 
tioned ifit is equitable that the taxpayers of some thirty years in the future should 
be called upon to pay for services rendered a third of a century before. The idea that 
the state, or more specifically in this case, the Commonwealth, is in its nature per- 
petual must give way, it would seem, before the very practical consideration that 
the sources of funds to pay the employer’s share, the taxpayers’ share, of the annui- 
ties of the future are the pocketbooks of the future. Against this fact not even the 
advantages to be gained thirty years hence through ridding the public service of in- 
efficient employees, can weigh. From the point of view of the ethics of government 
financial theory, the system is at this point questionable, though it is actuarially 
economical with respect to present funds. 
The method of meeting accrued liabilities is similar to that in operation in New 
South Wales. All employees above the age of thirty are permitted to contribute up 
to four units of pension, £104 per annum, as at rate for age of thirty years. “The 
Government makes up the difference between that rate and the rate of contribution 
corresponding to the age of the officer, in addition to the £1 for £1 contribution for 
which the Government is liable.” In addition, “provision has been made in the Act 
to enable any employee, who has a vested or contingent right to pension, superan- 
nuation allowance or gratuity under any other Act or State Act, to come under the 
Superannuation Act to a limited extent, but not so as to give him any benefits be- 
yond those which an employee without pension rights may enjoy.” These provisions, 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
and the options through which they operate, are just and sound, and they will con- 
tribute materially to economy in expenditures for superannuation. 
In short, then, the Australia Superannuation Act is almost a model of its kind. 
New South Wales 
The agitation which has been raised concerning the solvency of the State Super- 
annuation Fund of New South Wales should be quieted by the Fourth Annual Re- 
port for the year ended June 80, 1923. From this statement of the case it would ap- 
pear that questions have been asked in some newspapers which tended to discredit 
the standing of the Fund, and that it has been alleged that the sum of £2,000,000 
is due for immediate payment into it. 
As regards solvency, it can only be said that if the terms of the Act of 1916 as 
passed are adhered to in administration, there can be no question that the Fund is 
solvent and fully able to meet its current liabilities. The members of the Board, how- 
ever, guard themselves in their report with a qualification of this statement, to the 
effect that the quinquennial actuarial investigation, which is due as of June 30, 
1924, alone can show conclusively “the state and sufficiency of the Fund.” This at- 
titude on the part of the members is worthy of emulation in some of our own states, 
especially in those where many words and much time have been wasted in attempt- 
ing to prove teachers retirement funds solvent or insolvent without the necessary 
actuarial accounting. Nothing but actuarial study of the best quality can establish 
the assets and the liabilities of a pension fund; actuarial study which is inferior in 
quality is a waste of money. 
The allegation that the sum of £2,000,000 is due for immediate payment into the 
Fund is stated to be quite inaccurate. This amount really represents the liabilities 
accrued in respect to old employees, which are to be discharged by the “equated pay- 
ments” provided in the Superannuation Act itself, in a manner which is entirely 
sound and economical. It is true that during the year 1922-23 no payment to the 
Fund was made by the Crown, but this fact is explained in a statement made by 
the Attorney-General to the Legislative Assembly. From this statement it appears 
that the Government acknowledges this obligation; that there is not the slightest 
intention of repudiating it; and that the reasons why it has not been discharged are 
first that the number of years over which the “equated payments” shall extend 
has not been determined, and secondly, that the prospective costs to the taxpayers 
of the State Superannuation Fund, the Police Superannuation Fund, the Railway 
Superannuation Fund, and the fund of the Civil Service Act of 1884, especially as 
regards the benefits provided by the State and the accrued liabilities, both of which 
must be financed through taxes, are now the subject of actuarial enquiry by the 
Government. With such assurances as these, there would seem to be no basis for the 
agitation.

  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 161 
Argentina 
One of the most sweeping pension laws ever enacted was passed by the Argentine 
Congress on November 29, 1923, establishing the national Cajas de Prevision Social 
or Social Provident Funds. Indications are to the effect that the new law represents 
one phase of a series of social enactments which have marked the period of radical 
domination in the Congress and which include similiar earlier pension enactments 
for employees of banks and newspapers. At any rate, it shows the impracticability of 
imposing government control over the provisions for old age without the consent of 
the parties involved, and it has provided some interesting results bearing upon the 
relation of compulsory superannuation to industry. 
The ostensible purpose of the law is to provide annuities and pensions for em- 
ployees and workmen of the National Mercantile Marine, all industrial and mer- 
cantile establishments, and all periodical press publications and the graphic arts— 
in short, for practically all wage-earners of the country except those in domestic 
service and in agriculture. To this end four Social Provident Funds are established, 
to which the employees affected are to contribute five per cent of their compensation 
and their employers a like amount, and for which separate accounts are,to be kept, 
though there is no indication that the contributions are to be individually credited. 
The funds are to be administered by a Board, consisting of a President appointed 
by the Executive Power, four representatives elected by the employees, and four 
members elected by the employers, with alternates, to serve for three years, at sala- 
ries fixed by their own budget. Within one year an actuarial survey of the whole 
situation shall be undertaken by a Technical Committee, to determine what bene- 
fits, for superannuation, disability, and death, will be available under the law. Ex- 
penses of administration are to be met from the funds, but they are not to exceed 
three per cent of the amounts received, presumably in one year for one year of oper- 
ation. The funds are to be invested, half in national interest-bearing bonds, and 
half in mortgages. No worse example of acting first and counting the costs and bene- 
fits afterward could be found. 
The decree for the enforcement of the law was signed late in January, 1924, by 
the President of the Republic, Dr. Marcelo T. de Alvear, and contributions began. 
At once very serious dissatisfaction with the plan was manifested by both workers 
and employers, in consequence of which on January 31, a second decree suspended the 
operation of the statute for sixty days. A third and final decree, which eliminated 
from the plan a preliminary contribution of one month’s compensation, made the 
law effective on April 30, 1924. Press dispatches indicate that protests against the 
law are not confined to employers, and that even the Socialists promulgated a gen- 
eral strike. The universal grounds for objection seem to be, first, that no adequate 
safeguards for the funds are provided, and, secondly, that there is no guarantee that 
any benefits ever will be paid. It is stated, furthermore, that in spite of the fact that 
a powerful labor movement exists in Argentina, there has never been any demand  
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
for such a law by the workers, either before or after its enactment. In response to 
popular demand, President Alvear sent to the Argentine Congress on May 5 a mes- 
sage embodying some nine suggestions for amendments to the law, which include the 
return of payments in case of involuntary retirement after five years and in the case 
of foreigners who leave the country, a service requirement of thirty years for super- 
annuation in certain occupations, and the privilege of retirement in case of disability 
without reference to age or service. Most employers began the required deductions 
as the law directs. Thus far the results of the law have been almost wholly evil, and 
there is small likelihood that they will ever be anything else. 
Tue Leacur or Nations 
The history of the attempt on the part of the League of Nations to establish a 
pension fund for its permanent staff is instructive, because it shows the difficulty of 
making intentions sort with performance. For over a year the Council, the Super- 
visory Commission, technical experts, and the Assembly worked upon the problem, 
with the result that the original intention to provide a compulsory old-age benefit 
for the staff of the Secretariat and of the International Labor Office was modified in 
general principles to such an extent that it was practically abandoned. The result 
was that in January, 1924, the Supervisory Commission found itself recommending 
not a superannuation plan, but a scheme for a savings fund. 
The successive phases of this change seem to be somewhat as follows: On March 1, 
1923, the Supervisory Commission, in accordance with the instructions of the Coun- 
cil, recommended certain general principles for a scheme of insurance for the Staff 
of the League. For the purpose of working out details, the Commission appointed 
a committee of two experts, Commendatore G. Toja, President of the Italian Na- 
tional Insurance Institute, and Sir Alfred Watson, the eminent English actuary, a 
member of Lord Emmott’s Committee on teachers retirement in England, to give 
the Commission the benefit of their experience and criticism. When these two ex- 
perts considered the scheme and the conditions to which it must apply, certain dif- 
ficulties developed. Signor Toja in his comments went at once to the heart of the 
problem: “The setting up of a pension fund on strictly technical principles is not 
possible. The general circumstances of the League of Nations have not that stable 
character which is essential for appraising and evaluating those demographical and 
financial factors on the basis of which an insurance company must work. The ques- 
tion therefore limits itself to this: to discover in what way pensions or benefits may 
be guaranteed either in case of retirement or in case of death, the system to be based 
on the application of the principle of ordinary saving and the principle of an insur- 
ance policy to be taken out with an insurance company.” With these ideas, Sir Alfred 
Watson was in substantial agreement. “It would be,” he stated, “extremely difficult 
to establish anything in the nature of an ordinary pension fund at the present time,
-P-A-G-E-175
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 163 
and . . . the choice lies between a system of individual savings, which may be called 
a Provident Fund plan, and a system of insurance through insurance companies.” 
He goes on, “To the extent to which money which might be accumulated for the 
old age of the official is deflected into an insurance scheme, the primary purpose must 
necessarily suffer. .. . The Provident Fund system gives the official, subject to such 
conditions as the League may require, the control of the combined savings when he 
reaches the age of 60. It must be expected that only if he is then in a sound state 
of health, will an annuity be bought. Necessarily, under this condition the annuity 
must be less than if it were automatically purchased whatever the state of health of 
the retiring official might be.” 
In the light of such exhaustive consideration of the subject, the Supervisory Com- 
mission on May 8, 1923, adopted a report containing a revised set of principles which 
are curiously ineffectual in tone. Of these, the first lays it down that “There shall be 
established for the Staff of the League of Nations a scheme of provision against old 
age, and against disablement or death accruing while the official is still in service.” 
The rest of the principles provide for joint equal contributions of five per cent each 
from the League and members of the Staff; compulsory participation of practically 
all permanent officials employed on contracts for seven years or more; a superannua- 
tion age of sixty; individual accounts for members; a financial committee; withdrawal 
benefits on a sliding scale; a death and disability fund, to be amassed, however, from 
retained contributions from the League on behalf of withdrawing members, which will 
be noticed later; extra death benefits of one year’s salary from the League, after the 
provision of the British Civil Service; certain options in respect to applying portions 
of members’ contributions to premiums on policies of life insurance; and a guarantee 
on the part of the League that all sums due to members shall be paid to them. Yet 
there is not one word which can be construed as a guarantee that the “provision 
against old age,” so clearly called for in the first article, will be carried out. That the 
accumulations shall be so used, is “expected,” as Sir Alfred Watson states the case, 
but it is not written into the provisions as a requirement. In short, the scheme is a 
plan for joint compulsory savings which may or may not be used for the purchase of 
a superannuation annuity; and, as Sir Alfred Watson points out, if the accumula- 
tions are so used, the retiring member must be penalized for the lateness of his pur- 
chase. The scheme must therefore be regarded as one of those curious anomalies which 
rise from the conflict of the best of intentions with the facts of the case. 
In this earlier draft the provisions for the disability fund are definitely made de- 
pendent upon withdrawals. This phase of the scheme is commented upon by Signor 
Toja as follows: “No permanent arrangements for the disability fund can be made 
at the outset; the amount of this fund will depend upon the movements which may 
take place among the staff, and there is no doubt that, after a certain number of years 
and when a certain uniformity of practice has been established, the fund itself may 
present fairly definite characteristics.” Sir Alfred Watson puts the matter more suc- 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
cinctly: “I have no means of forming an opinion as to how far this transitory provi- 
sion would be sufficient.” In the Draft of Staff Provident Fund Regulations, adopted 
by the Supervisory Commission, January 9-12, 1924, the Commission transfers the 
burden to the shoulders of the League, thus: “14 (New Article 22). The payments 
provided for [on account of death and disability] shall, as far as possible, be met out 
of the Death and Invalidity Fund. . . . In so far as this Fund is insufficient, the League 
shall be responsible for such payments.” In other words, the League must be pre- 
pared to take this risk, no matter what the cost. It should be said, however, that the 
expenditure probably will not be large. 
The contradictions contained in the Report of the Supervisory Commission dated 
May 8, 1923, are written into the Draft of Staff Provident Fund Regulations adopted. 
by the Commission at its three-day session in January, 1924. To the question, the 
Commission devoted an entire sitting. It had before it the resolution of the Fourth 
Assembly, dated September 28, 1923, in which the Assembly went on record as de- 
cided “to establish a compulsory pension fund,” at an expense not to exceed five per 
cent of the salary budget, and also its own previous reports and those of the two ex- 
perts. The Draft, effective as of January 1, 1924, provides for superannuation at age 
60, but the only provision against old age which it contains is stated in Article 6: 
“On the termination of the member's service, . . . the sum standing to the credit of 
his account, including interest . . . shall be paid to him or to his legal representa- 
tive.” The regulations are rightly designated as governing a “provident fund.” The 
resolution of the Fourth Assembly to provide a “compulsory pension fund” is as yet 
unfulfilled. 
Pensions ror CLERGYMEN 
The movement to provide retiring allowances for the clergy of the Protestant 
churches is gaining ground. Among the denominations which now offer their minis- 
ters pensions may be numbered the Baptists, through the Ministers and Missionaries 
Benefit Board and other bodies; the Congregationalists, through the Annuity Fund 
for Congregational Ministers; the Disciples of Christ, through the Board of Minis- 
terial Relief; the Episcopalians, through the Church Pension Fund; the Methodists, 
through the Board of Pensions and Relief, formerly the Board of Conference Claim- 
ants; the Presbyterians, through the Board of Ministerial Relief and Sustentation; 
the Reformed Church, and the United Brethren, through the Ministerial Pension 
and Annuity Plan. Of these denominations some of the plans are on a firm footing; 
for instance, the Annuity Fund for Congregational Ministers presents a model for 
the construction of similar systems. Others are on a less secure foundation, though for 
some time they have been struggling to pay retiring allowances on a cash-disburse- 
ment basis. Still others, finding the older methods of pensioning their ministers ex- 
tremely expensive, have met the situation squarely and are moving toward the inau- 
guration of new and sounder plans.
-P-A-G-E-177
       PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 165 
  The United Brethren in Christ commenced in 1924 the operation of a new pen- 
sion and annuity plan, which was the outgrowth of study and consideration begin- 
ning in 1917, and which was adopted at the Indianapolis General Conference in 1921. 
The plan, open to regularly ordained ministers and missionaries of the Church of the 
United Brethren, provides contributory membership for those who were not sixty-six 
years of age on January 1, 1922, and non-contributory membership for those who 
had passed their sixty-sixth birthday before that date. There are two funds: the Con- 
tributory Members’ Annuity Fund, and the Church Service Annuity Fund. “'The 
amount which each contributory member will be required to pay annually shall be 
actuarially computed, and shall be sufficient to pay an annuity of $100 to each con- 
tributory member who reaches the age of sixty-eight years,” though, except in cases 
of retirement for disability, members’ contributions cease at age 65. Only the in- 
come of the Church Service Annuity fund, which is gathered from budgetary allot- 
ment by the Board of Administration and other money, gifts, and bequests which 
the Fund may receive, is to be used for the payment of annuities. For a contributory 
member, the maximum superannuation annuity is $500, of which his own contribu- 
tions will supply $100, and the Church Service Annuity Fund $400. For a non-con- 
tributory member an annuity of $400 is to be paid from the Service Fund, but it will 
be pro-rated until the Fund reaches an amount sufficient to pay the full annuity. Dis- 
ability and death provisions are also included, and options are designated for pay- 
ments to widows and to children under eighteen years of age. The rates of annual 
contributions have been computed by an actuary to range from $19.40 at age 21 to 
$87 at age 55. A member entering the plan between the ages of 55 and 65 pays an- 
nually the regular rate as at age 55, but to his first payment must be added back pay- 
ments with interest at three per cent for his years beyond age 55. A member who 
withdraws from the service of the United Brethren Church or from the plan receives 
back his own contributions without interest. A contract is provided in the form of 
a certificate of membership. 
The Presbyterian General Assembly, which met at Grand Rapids in May, 1924, 
gave its formal sanction to a retirement plan to supersede an inadequate pension 
system, which is said to have been the first in the ministerial field. The new plan calls 
for an endowment of $15,000,000. It is to be operated from contributions of ten per 
cent of the member-minister’s salary, of which 24 per cent is to be sent in by the 
pastor and 7} per cent by the church which he serves or the agency which employs 
him. The large fund will, it is estimated, take care of the accrued liabilities. The age 
for the receipt of the annuity, which is to be not less than $600, is to be 65, with a 
service requirement of thirty-five years, and the payment of the annuity is not con- 
tingent upon retirement. The system will, of course, be supplementary to the Annuity 
Bonds now issued by the Board of Ministerial Relief and Sustentation. 
The present Pension System of the Board of Ministerial Relief of the Disciples 
of Christ is in many respects similar to that of the United Brethren. It was inaugu-   
-P-A-G-E-178

rated on January 1, 1919, and it is so planned as to provide a retiring allowance of 
$500 a year commencing at age 65, after at least thirty years of service. Three-fifths 
of this amount, or $300, are also provided in death benefits to the widow for life or 
for children until they attain their majority, without reference to the term of ser- 
vice. Of the total costs, one-fifth is paid by the minister, while four-fifths are carried 
by the churches. Disability provisions are included, and a contract in the form of a 
certificate is issued. Both this plan and that of the United Brethren provide what 
would appear to be for certain parts of the country and for certain cases a very 
meagre superannuation allowance. A retired clergyman who must eke out his exist- 
ence by non-ecclesiastical employment is not respected as he should be by the church 
to which he has ministered. 
Besides these plans, the Southern Methodists and the Universalists are consider- 
ing the establishment of retirement systems for their pastors. Proposals have also 
been submitted by the Committee on Synagogue Pension Funds to the Union of 
American Hebrew Congregations, one an actuarial plan calling for a reserve fund of 
$1,300,000 and a retiring age of sixty-nine years. 
Pensions 1n Inpustry 
The suit begun on September 25, 1923, on behalf of some three hundred and 
eighty pensioners of Morris and Company of Chicago will furnish, when decided, an 
interesting commentary upon the contractual nature of industrial pension plans. On 
January 1, 1909, Morris and Company instituted a contributory pension plan with 
retirement optional for employees who had reached the age of fifty-five years and had 
had twenty years of service with the company. On April 22,1912, retirement was made 
obligatory at age 65. The pension allowed to officers and employees was computed 
on the basis of two per cent of their salaries at the date of retirement for each year 
of service, but the annual pension was not to exceed $5000. Widows were entitled to 
one-half of their husbands’ allowances, and after their death dependent children also 
received a provision until the age of eighteen. Employees and officers contributed 
three per cent of their salaries up to $7500 a year. Though membership at the be- 
ginning of the plan was optional for present employees, new employees after six months 
of service were required to join. The company was to contribute $25,000 each year 
until the fund reached $500,000. The operation of the plan was in the hands of a 
committee of five members, two appointed by the company and three elected by em- 
ployees of specified departments, who received and invested all funds in good secur- 
ities, granted pensions, both superannuation and disability, and had the power to 
“annul, alter, add to, or amend any of the rules and regulations” governing the fund. 
No written contract was provided in the plan, and the company seems not to have 
bound itself specifically beyond the sum of half a million dollars. 
In October, 1922, Morris and Company merged with Armour and Company. Just
-P-A-G-E-179
  PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 167 
what happened with respect to the pension plans of the two companies is difficult to 
state. Armour and Company have a pension plan, effective November 1,1911, optional 
for salaried women employees, obligatory for salaried men. Many of the provisions of 
the plan are similar to that of Morris and Company: members contribute three per 
cent of their salaries, up to a $7500 maximum contribution, retirement is compulsory 
at age 65 after twenty years of service, disability clauses are included together with 
provisions for widows and children, and the amount of the allowance is based on two 
per cent of final salary for each year of continuous service, with a maximum of $5000. 
The governing board is appointed by the directors of Armour and Company, and the 
company contributes an unspecified amount up to one million dollars. One sentence 
from the second article of the plan may be quoted: The Pension Fund “constitutes 
no contract and confers no legal rights upon any employee.” 
The Morris plan, as amended up to October 11, 1912, contains no such expressed 
provision, but the sections concerning the company’s liability and control by the com- 
mittee may operate to the same effect. At the time of the merger, the contributions 
of certain employees of Morris and Company who were taken over by Armour and 
Company were received for the Armour Fund. Some of the active employees not re- 
engaged by Armour and Company had their accumulations returned to them. After 
obligations had been met, there were, it is said, $320,000 in the Morris Fund. But 
the Morris pensioners were not transferred to the Armour plan. Instead, it is stated 
that members of the Morris family made a gift of $500,000 to care for them, an 
amount which coincides with that specified as the maximum of the fund in Article IV 
of the Morris pension plan. Now, it has been estimated that this sum will provide 
allowances for the four hundred and more Morris pensioners and former employees 
who were retired or about to retire at the time of the merger, for a period of some 
eighteen months only. To satisfy the actuarial value of this accrued liability would 
require, it is said, the sum of $8,000,000 disbursed principal and interest over some 
twenty-five years. To have such a trust fund created from the assets of Morris and 
Company and to demand an accounting, some twenty of the persons affected filed the 
suit in the Circuit Court. The issue will, it is expected, have a bearing upon the con- 
tractual nature of a very large number of industrial pension systems in the United. 
States. Most of the recently inaugurated industrial pension plans contain a clause 
which puts the matter very exactly. 
For instance, the British Empire Steel Corporation, Ltd., opened for itself and 
its constituent companies in 1923 a pension fund which, “being established volunta- 
rily by the Corporation as a provision for the benefit of employees superannuated or 
incapacitated after long service, constitutes no contract and confers no legal right 
upon any employee.” The plan is non-contributory. To men employees of twenty- 
five years standing who have reached the age of sixty-five, and to women employees 
of the same service and the age of fifty-five, at their own request, or the request of 
their employing officers, monthly pensions are to be paid at the rate of one per cent
-P-A-G-E-180
168 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
of the average monthly salary during the last ten years of service multiplied by the 
number of years spent in the employ of the corporation. The fund is to be admin- 
istered by a Pension Committee of from five to nine employees, appointed by the 
Board of Directors of the Corporation, and the actions and decisions of the Commit- 
tee are subject to review by the Board. Constituent companies include the Domin- 
ion Steel Corporation, Ltd., the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, Ltd., the Do- 
minion Coal Company, Ltd., the Cumberland Railway and Coal Company, the Nova 
Scotia Steel and Coal Company, Ltd., the Halifax Shipyards, Ltd., and the subsid-_ 
iaries of these companies. 
The non-contributory pension plan of the Boston Consolidated Gas Company, 
which was effective as of April 1, 1919, has been extended to apply to the Consoli- 
dated Gas Company, Waltham. Retirement, which takes place for men at age 70 and 
for women at age 65, after twenty years of service, is rewarded with a pension of two 
per cent of the average annual salary over the last ten service years multiplied by 
the number of years of service. Provision is made for disability. The plan may be 
changed or abandoned by the company on three months’ notice, “but any pension 
allowance in force shall continue without change.” 
An ingenious profit-sharing arrangement has been adopted by the Crowell Pub- 
lishing Company of New York City and Springfield, Ohio, the proceeds of which may 
be used for superannuation benefits. Into the fund the company pays annually for 
each year five per cent of its net earnings before deductions for dividends, while em- 
ployees may deposit five per cent of their salaries up to $150 a year. “It is intended 
that, so far as practicable and advisable, the Fund shall be invested in shares of the 
common stock of the Crowell Publishing Company to the end that each employee 
may become a part owner of the business,” but the trustees are empowered to make 
other investments, and loans to depositors as well. The amounts of retiring allow- 
ances are not specified, but the intention behind the plan is frankly to make them 
contingent upon the success of the company, in which every participating employee 
has a shareholder’s interest. Thus the plan places its retiring employees in a some- 
what more direct relation to the company and its good or ill fortune than the ma- 
jority of joint contributory, limited-contractual pension systems. Properly speaking, 
the plan is scarcely a pension system at all. 
The W. P. Fuller Company of San Francisco has begun to operate a pension plan, 
effective in February, 1922, which is based upon requirements of age and service and 
limits payments of two per cent for each year of service to a minimum of $480 and 
a maximum of seventy-five per cent of average annual pay for the five years next pre- 
ceding retirement. Military or naval service in the World War is considered as equiv- 
alent to service with the company. Though the plan may be withdrawn or modified 
at any time, payment once begun is guaranteed, except in case of gross misconduct, 
assignment of rights, or taking employment with a competitor. The Herpolsheimer 
Company, which operates a department store in Grand Rapids, Michigan, reserves
-P-A-G-E-181
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 169 
the right to alter or abolish its tentative pension plan, effective March 1, 1924, at 
any time. 
After some years of investigation, an amended pension plan has been put into opera- 
tion as of September 15, 1923, for the Copper Queen Branch of the Phelps Dodge 
Corporation. The retirement age for superannuation is fifty-eight, with a service re- 
quirement of twenty-two years. Disability retirement may take place after fifteen 
years’ employment. The benefit for age amounts to an annual sum equivalent to two 
per cent of the average salary for each year of service, while disability or other pen- 
sions granted before the age of fifty-eight are reduced according to the expectation of 
life at the age of retirement as compared with that for age 58 according to the Ameri- 
can Experience Table of Mortality. The company intends to contribute $150,000 per 
year, but if the sum should at any time prove insufficient, the pensions are to be re- 
duced pro-rata. A Pension Board of nine employees, four named by the company and 
four named by the workers, together with the Manager of the Copper Queen Branch, 
administers the plan, with power to modify the rules. The pension plan “is a purely 
voluntary provision for the benefit of employees after long and faithful service, and 
constitutes no contract and confers no legal rights upon any employee.” 
A similar safeguard is included in the Service Annuity Plan of the Middle West 
Utilities Company, the Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and the Wisconsin 
Power, Light and Heat Company, which went into effect on January 1, 1924. In gen- 
eral, provision is made for the retirement of men employees at the age of sixty-five 
and of women employees at the age of sixty, unless for special reasons they are con- 
tinued in active service, and for the retirement, under certain conditions, of men em- 
ployees at the age of sixty and of women at the age of fifty-five. The amount of the 
annual payment ranges from one and a half to two per cent of the average salary of 
the employee for the period of continuous service multiplied by the number of years 
of service with the company, up to one-half of the final annual salary, but not in ex- 
cess of $6000 per year. The plan is administered by a board of five trustees, all of 
whom are officers or employees of the company, three appointed by the Board of Direc- 
tors and two elected annually by the employees. The amount to be voted by the com- 
pany to maintain the system is not specified. The pension plan of the Wickwire- 
Spencer Steel Corporation, approved by the Board of Directors on September 21, 
1923, resembles these plans in a number of provisions. Differences may be noted with 
respect to the age requirements, seventy years for men and sixty for women compul- 
sorily retired, and sixty-five for men and fifty-five for women voluntarily retired, the 
service requirement of twenty-five years, and the basis of the pension, one per cent 
of the average pay for the last ten years of service with a maximum of $100 a month 
and a minimum of $12. 
A number of features of the pension plan of the Willard Storage Battery Com- 
pany are unusual. In the first place, the plan includes a deed of trust, making over to 
three trustees the sum of $100,000, which, together with other contributions which 
   
-P-A-G-E-182
    170 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
the company intends to provide, may be put into safe and reliable investments, but 
not into the stock and securities of the company. Male employees with thirty years’ 
service may be retired at sixty years of age, females, at fifty-five. The pension, also, 
is computed upon a liberal basis: for each year of active service specifically defined 
an allowance is provided of one and one-half per cent of the average annual compen- 
sation, including salaries, wages, and bonus, for the ten consecutive years of highest 
earnings, with a maximum of $5000 a year. But “neither the establishment of this 
system nor the granting of a pension nor any other action now or hereafter taken 
by the Pension Board or the officers of the company shall be held or construed as 
creating a contract.” 
Although the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad has established as 
of July 1, 1923, a pension system which, in conjunction with the Voluntary Relief 
Department of the company, presents a number of features similar to the retirement 
plans of some of the other railroads, it is of interest to discover that a new phase 
seems to be commencing in railroad pensions. Employees are beginning to take an 
initiating interest in retirement plans, to the extent that in at least one case they 
have established their own pension system. Generally, the official attitude of organ- 
ized labor has been opposed to private industrial pensions. For instance, Mr. Samuel 
Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, has been quoted as saying, 
“Where the workers receive an adequate wage, one that will permit them to live as 
an American should live, they will provide their own pension system, and whatever 
men do for themselves increases their value as workers.”! This seems to be exactly 
what has been done by employees of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway 
Company. 
The railroad has no pension or retirement fund of its own. In October, 1923, a 
group of its employees organized the Milwaukee Pension Association, under a charter 
issued by the State of Illinois. The purpose of the Association is primarily provision 
for old age, but protection in case of disability is included with the intention of 
making the member’s status in that respect the same as for superannuation. The 
intention is, to build up in the course of some five years a reserve fund by contri- 
butions from members, uniform over groups in ten-year periods, with a uniform ben- 
efit payment. Though the Association was started only in January, 1924, expecta- 
tions point to a membership practically complete for the railroad by the end of the 
year. That the employees of other railroads are becoming more interested in retire- 
ment plans is shown by the growth of the Pension Association of the Brotherhood 
of Locomotive Engineers, which in the autumn of 1923 placed some 281 widows on 
its pension list, and by the proposals for a joint-contributory retirement system sub- 
mitted in April, 1924, by the employees of the New York, New Haven, and Hart- 
ford Railroad Company. The impracticability, even the impossibility, of making a 
free pension contractual has been demonstrated again and again. A pension which

is not founded upon a legally enforcible contract represents a hope, and not a de- 
pendable support in old age. Employers hesitate to commit themselves and their 
companies to future payments which may attain proportions beyond their ability 
to meet. Yet a legally enforcible contract is just what an employee must have if his 
old age is to be secure. 
Otp AcE Pensions IN THE UnrreD SratEs 
“The Demoralizing Effects of Old-Age Pensions” are studied with special refer- 
ence to European Laws, by Mr. P. Tecumseh Sherman, former Commissioner of 
Labor in New York, in Current History for March, 1924, After a brief analysis of 
the existing pension provisions in Europe, Mr. Sherman condemns them because they 
are expensive; because they do not materially reduce the need for poor-relief; because 
they lead to increases in the pauper class; and, above all, because “in manufacturing 
paupers, we are unmaking men.” European experience indicates that “public pensions 
should be bestowed only as a reward for real public service, and that the aims of old-age 
pensions can be accomplished only by some form of contributory old-age insurance.” 
In America, during 1923, “bills for old-age pension laws were introduced in the legis- 
latures of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massa- 
chusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Penn- 
sylvania, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and in Pennsylvania, Montana, 
and Nevada old-age pension laws were enacted.” As Mr. Sherman points out, these 
three laws are similar in content. Those of Nevada and Pennsylvania provide a pen- 
sion of one dollar per day, that of Montana, twenty-five dollars per month; in Penn- 
sylvania and Montana after age seventy, in Nevada after age sixty. Qualifications of 
citizenship, and of residence for fifteen years, are set, and the applicant must not have 
been an inmate of a correctional institution, or a tramp or beggar, within the pre- 
vious year; nor must he or she possess property exceeding $3000 in value. 
The Massachusetts Legislature, instead of enacting a law, constituted a Commis- 
sion on Pensions, with Mr. Frank H. Hardison as Chairman and Mr. Edmund 8. 
Cogswell as Secretary and Actuary, to study the situation and to report early in 
1925. This Commission has begun the investigation of old age and dependency in 
the Commonwealth, to obtain by the analysis of perhaps as many as twenty thousand 
cases in an assorted geographical, social, and industrial selection of cities and towns, 
what may be described as a cross section of conditions bearing upon the problem. 
The data are collected by visitation and personal interview. If the Commission suc- 
ceeds in its endeavors, it will have accomplished one of the outstanding studies in 
the field of superannuation. The aim is to present an unbiased report upon not only 
old-age pensions, but also the whole question of retirement in the Commonwealth, 
including the schools and industrial establishments; in other words, scientific study, 
not hasty and ill-advised legislation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184

172 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
The sociological basis of such laws as have been enacted seems to be stated in a 
bill introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Victor L. Berger 
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 11, 1924 (H. R. 6858) — “to provide out of 
the public purse sufficient income for the old to enable them to enjoy the last remain- 
ing years of their lives in such freedom from the fear of want as they have earned 
by a long service for society as citizens of the Republic.” Mr. Berger’s bill would 
therefore establish as law and place (Section 11) beyond the jurisdiction of any Fed- 
eral court the proposition that “ service” asa citizen endows with the right to claim 
support from the government. The applicant would have no duty except to have 
been a citizen for sixteen consecutive years and lived to the age of sixty; to have 
escaped. conviction of felony; if a husband, to have maintained his wife and his 
children under sixteen years of age; if a wife, not to have deserted her children; and 
to receive no income in excess of $8 per week. The absurdity of such a law in the 
present state of society seems to have been recognized by Congress, for the bill was 
allowed to expire in committee. At the same time, the relation between this propo- 
sal, the old-age pension laws of Pennsylvania, Montana, and Nevada, and the sug- 
gestion voiced by the National Education Association’s Committee on Pensions that 
the accrued liabilities of all state teachers retirement systems be assumed by the Fed- 
eral government, is too striking to pass without notice. 
Peyston Lirerarure 
The material published during the year which bears upon the theory of superan- 
nuation and retirement has done less to add to the body of knowledge already in 
existence than to restate and reaffirm with clarity and accuracy the principles of the 
subject. Besides the publications which have been mentioned on other pages of the 
present discussion, others deserve more than the passing notice which may be here 
accorded them. In the April, 1924, number of Cotton, Mr. R. L. Mattocks, actuary 
of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, discusses “Pension Systems, 
Sound and Unsound.” As regards soundness in a plan for retirement, Mr. Mattocks 
writes: “'The prime factor is definiteness as to the amount of pension. Once the 
amount of benefit is fixed, either asa certain annual sum of money or as that amount 
of annuity which the accumulated contributions will purchase in accordance with a 
conservative mortality table, then the cost of the system may be definitely expressed. 
In the first case, the cost is that amount of money which, set aside annually, will, 
with its accumulation, produce the amount of benefit desired. In the second case, it 
is whatever percentage of the current payroll it is agreed to set aside annually.” Mr. 
H. H. Baish, Secretary of the Pennsylvania State Retirement Board, and also general 
manager of the Ministerial Pension and Annuity Plan of the Church of the United 
Brethren, in a discussion of “ Retirement Systems and Morale in Public Service,”
-P-A-G-E-185
PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 173 
printed in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, May, 
1924, says: “A retirement system that will help the morale must have and retain the 
confidence of the employes, and this result can be assured only by a system that is actu- 
ariallysound from center to circumference. The usual procedure isto agree on the char- 
acter of the benefits that are to be obtained, and then after a careful actuarial inves- 
tigation of the mortality and service experience of the employes, the rates of contri- 
bution are adopted for both the employes and the Government.” Further along in 
his discussion he drops a word of warning : “ Retirement systems that are operating 
under the cash disbursement plan, and are now congratulating themselves because the 
cost to the Government is less than similar systems operating under the actuarial 
reserve plan, will in a few years find the situation reversed. . . . The continued actu- 
arial soundness of the retirement system can, therefore, be maintained only by hav- 
ing the contributions of both the employes and the Government paid promptly when 
due and carefully invested.” Mr. Baish summarizes the provisions of some seven re- 
tirement systems for State and Federal employees, with comments. Concerning the 
New York State Employees’ Retirement System, he writes, “The only just criticism 
which it must face has to do with its method of administration.” With such a notion, 
it is safe to say, Mr. Mattocks, who expresses the strongest disapproval of the fal- 
lacy of the “final average salary,” would scarcely agree. 
Nor would Mr. James E. Kavanagh, who in an address before the twelfth annual 
meeting of the Chamber of Commerce of the United States at Cleveland, on “Indus- 
trial Pensions, or the Care of Faithful Workers,” said: “It is extremely risky busi- 
ness . . . to base pension fund calculations upon probable length of employment,” in 
other words, upon withdrawals. “ Another dangerous fallacy is the effort to set up a 
reserve based upon the percentage of the final salary or the final few years of salary. 
... It is impossible accurately to set up a known reserve against an unknown liabil- 
ity.” Mr. Kavanagh struck to the root of the whole subject of costs when he said: “It 
is not pensions that are costly. It is Delay.” The Metropolitan Life Insurance Com- 
pany of New York, of which Mr. Kavanagh is a Vice-President, has added much to 
the clarification of pension problems by a series of circulars devised to introduce its 
contractual annuities to industrial establishments. 
Principal W. W. Roberts, of the Herzl School, Chicago, continues his studies of 
retirement systems in two articles printed in the Chicago Schools Journal, one on 
“Pensions for Board of Education Employees in Chicago,” the other on “'The Chi- 
cago Teachers’ Pension System.” Mr. Roberts finds that the employees are more 
soundly provided for than the teachers, whose system “was born of a kindly spirit”; 
“in spite of its faults it has done a great service,” though it is shown to be inade- 
quate, inequitable, and obsolete. 
Finally, mention should be made of a Zurich inaugural dissertation by Karl von 
Wolff, Die Pensionsversicherungs in der Stédtischen Beamten, Angestellten und Ar-  
-P-A-G-E-186
  174 PENSION SYSTEMS AND PENSION LEGISLATION 
beiter in der Schweiz.” Dr. Wolff describes in detail the pension and sick-benefit sys- 
tems for civil employees and others in some fifteen of the cities of Switzerland, and 
his discussion is clarified by numerous tables and charts.

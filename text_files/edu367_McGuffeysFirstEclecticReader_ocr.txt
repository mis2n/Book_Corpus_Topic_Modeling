  SuGcEstTions TO TEACHERS. 
This Frrst READER may be used in teaching reading by any of 
the methods in common use; but it is especially adapted to the 
Phonic Method, the Word Method, or a combination of the two. 
I. PHonic Meruop.—First teach the elementary sounds and 
their representatives, the letters marked -vith diacriticais, as they 
occur in the lessons; then, the formation of words by the combi- 
nation of these sounds. For instance, teach the pupil to identify 
the characters i, 5, n, d, %, r, and th, in Lesson I, as the repre- 
sentatives of certain elementary sounds; then, teach him to form 
words by their combination, and to identify them at sight. Use 
first the words at the head of the lesson, then other words, as, 
nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the succeed- 
  ing lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to 
teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and re- 
quire the groups, “a man,” “the man,” “a pen,” “the pen,” to be 
read as a good reader would pronounce single words. 
II. When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is 
marked in the words at the head of the reading exercises, the 
other is silent. If neither is marked, the two letters represent a 
diphthong. All other unmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when 
in combination, are silent letters, In slate or blackboard work, 
the silent letters may be canceled. 
III. Worp Meruop.—Teach the pupil to identify at sight the 
words placed at the head of the reading exercises, and to read 
these exercises without hesitation. Having read a few lessons, 
begin to teach the names of the letters and the spelling of words. 
IV. Worp MertHop anv Prontc MerHop Comsrnep.--Teach the 
pupil to identify words and read sentences, as above. Having 
read a few lessons in this manner, begin to use the Phonic Method, 
combining it with the Word Method, by first teaching the words 
in each lesson as words; then, the elementary sounds, the names 
of the letters, and spelling. 
V. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teach- 
ing the names of the letters and the spelling of words.

  In presenting MCGurrey’s Revisep First REeapEr to the 
public, attention is invited to the following features: 
1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first 
lessons. Longer and more difficult ones are gradually intro- 
duced as the pupil gains aptness in the mastery of words. 
2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new 
words are placed at the head of each lesson, to be learned be- 
fore the lesson is read. Their number in the early lessons is 
very small, thus making the first steps easy. All words in these 
vocabularies are used in the text immediately following. 
8. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a 
double purpose. These should be used to teach the reading of 
script; and may also serve as copies in slate work. 
4, The illustrations have been designed and engraved spe- 
cially for the lessons in which they occur. Many of. these en- 
gravings will serve admirably as the basis for oral lessons in 
language. 
5. The type is large, strong, and distinct. 
The credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the 
many friends of MCGurrry’s READERS,—eminent teachers and 
scholars, who have contributed suggestions and criticisms gained 
from their daily work in the schoolroom.

A little girl went in search 
of flowers for her mother. It 
was early in the day, and the

were singing all around her. 
And what do you think she 
found besides flowers? <A_ nest

them, she heard the mother 
bird chirp, as if she said, “Do 
not touch my children, little girl, 
for I love them dearly.” 
The little girl now thought 
how dearly her own mother 
loved her. 
So she left the birds. Then.

Polly can say, “Poor Poll! Poor

and she can mew like a cat. 
But Polly and the cat are not

I think she knew the cat 
would not like that, and she 
did it to tease her. 
When Lucy pets the cat, Polly 
flies up into the old apple tree, 
and will not come when she 
calls her. Then Lucy says, “ What

the old hen took good care of 
them. She found food for them 
in the daytime, and at night 
kept them under her wings. 
One day, this old hen took 
her chickens down to a _ small 
brook. She thought the air 
from the water would do them 
good. 
When they got to the brook, 
they walked on the bank a lit- 
tle while. It was very pretty 
on the other side of the brook, 
and the old hen thought she 
would take her children over 
there. 
There was a large stone in 
the brook: she thought it would 
be easy for them to jump to 
that stone, and from it to the 
other side.
-P-A-G-E-90

So she jumped to the stone, 
and told the children to come 
after her. For the first time, 
she found that they would not 
obey her. 
She flapped her wings, and 
cried, “Come here, all of you! 
Jump upon this stone, as I did. 
We can then jump to the other 
side. Come, now!” 
“Q mother! we can’t, we 
can’t, we can’t!” said all the 
little chickens. 
“Yes you can, if you try,” 
said the old hen. “Just flap 
your wings, as I did, and you 
can jump over.” 
“T am flapping my _ wings,” 
said Chippy, who stood by him- 
self; “but I can’t jump any bet-

chirped the little chickens.

slowly home with her brood.

“We didn't,” said the others; 
“it was of no use to try.” 
When they got home, the old 
hen began to look about for 
something to eat. She soon 
found, near the back door, a 
piece of bread. 
So she called the chickens, 
and they all ran up to her, 
each one trying to get a bite 
at the piece of bread. 
“No, no!” said the old hen. 
“This bread is for Chippy. He 
is the only one of my children 
that really tried to jump to the

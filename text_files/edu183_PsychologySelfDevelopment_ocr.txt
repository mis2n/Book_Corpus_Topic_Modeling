  PREFACE 
The selection and rejection of material for this book has 
been an evolution in the classroom during many years of 
search for (1) that which will function directly in increas- 
ing the student’s capacity as a learner; (2) that which will 
afford the most useful basis for a course in teacher-training ; 
(3) that which will best meet the needs for a first course in 
college psychology ; (4) that which, instead of merely skim- 
ming the cream of interest, will definitely project the stu- 
dent’s interest and expectation toward a further and more 
adequate pursuit of the subject; (5) that which will best 
help the young student to maintain his poise amid the dizzy- 
ing enlargements of his mental horizon as he climbs the 
ascent of higher education and thinks he sees dark chasms 
yawning between his new knowledge and his old faith. 
It has been the intention to admit nothing which is merely 
argumentative or speculative, which is not essential to the 
scientific integrity of the whole plan or practically applicable 
to the needs of the learner, and to omit nothing which prop- 
erly belongs in a thorough first course in psychology. The 
functional viewpoint and the physiological basis have been 
woven into every chapter. A close-knit system of treatment 
has been sought which explains all psychical phenomena in 
terms of associations and progressive integration and the 
conditions which forward or retard these. Each topic grows 
directly out of the preceding and usually begins with a con- 
necting summary statement. A sufficiently technical vocab- 
ulary has been gradually built up by introducing each word 
where the connection makes its meaning clear. It is hoped

that nothing has been lost in scope or scientific accuracy by 
| the effort to make statements simple. 
The ideal of the book is practical helpfulness. The more 
nearly a student can be brought to pursue an elementary 
course in psychology as a project in the development of his 
own mind, the better will be the resulting knowledge of pure 
psychology, aside from the practical values which are per- 
haps more important than the scientific attainments. The 
exercises at the end of the chapters (which the instructor 
should freely change and adapt to his own and the students’ 
interests) should contribute as largely to clarifying the scien- 
tific view as to the attainment of practical values. It is be- 
lieved that the introspective as well as the pedagogical habit 
of mind cannot be better acquired than through the abundant 
use of exercises of this sort. 
My sincere gratitude is due to my colleague, Dr. J. R. 
Geiger, and to my ever-helpful wife for invaluable discus- 
sions and criticisms throughout the preparation of the 
manuscript. If the effort shall prove to be of value my in- 
debtedness is to so many inspiring teachers and texts that { 
I am at a loss to single out the few. For aid in the partic- 
ular selection of topics and treatment I am indebted to the 
reactions of hundreds of students during many years of 
class work.

PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF- 
DEVELOPMENT 
CHAPTER I 
THE ART OF LEARNING 
Civilization and learning. Progress and civilization consist 
in better ways of doing things. To dispel darkness we have 
passed through the successive ages of the grease lamp, the 
tallow candle, kerosene, and gas, to electric lighting. For 
communicating thought we passed through centuries of mere 
gestures and inarticulate cries, of crude hieroglyphics, to the 
printing press, postal systems, and marvels of the wires and 
wireless. For carrying burdens we have relieved the backs 
of men and donkeys by trains and ships of stupendous 
strength and capacity ; while from nature’s laborious plan of 
moving ourselves about with the aid of our feet only we have 
advanced beyond the wildest dreams of the Arabian Nights 
to the luxurious swiftness of automobiles, express trains, and 
airplanes. There are few forms of heavy toil which we have 
not learned to shift to the untiring accuracy of machinery 
and the unflagging strength of natural forces. Modern civi- 
lization in every field of achievement laughs at limitations 
and makes the impossible of yesterday the commonplace of 
today. Each forward step has been a means whereby man’s 
ingenuity has increased the capacity of his body or of his 
mind to do the things he wants done. Each has been the 
effect of learning the best from the past and learning how to 
I
-P-A-G-E-10
  2 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
pass it on better yet to the future. Only by increasing skill in 
learning how to know what has been done and how to do 
what can be done has progress been possible. The advance- 
ment of civilization is but the advancement of the power to 
learn. 
Better methods of learning. There are efficient, economi- 
cal ways of learning, and there are laborious, wasteful, and 
futile ways. The best modern scientific method of acquiring 
knowledge or skill is as different from the primitive, un- 
studied way as an electric light is from a pine-knot torch, or 
an express train from a pack donkey. It is easy to demon- 
strate, for example, that any student, by the use of intelligent 
methods, may acquire a given degree of excellence in penman- 
ship or spelling with the expenditure of a small fraction of 
the time and energy necessary by the hit-or-miss, “trial and 
error” methods commonly used by pupils. As truly as one 
may grow five to eight times as many bushels of corn on an 
acre of land by the application of modern scientific methods 
of agriculture as he can by the traditional primitive methods, 
so he can acquire many times the mathematical skill or his- 
torical knowledge in the same number of hours of effort 
through the scientific direction of his mental processes that 
he can by the haphazard methods of study used by the major- 
ity of students. It is only because learning is so much more 
subtle a process, because differences in efficiency are so much 
~ more difficult to see or measure or demonstrate, that its 
better methods are not widely known and generally used. 
Learning is such a private and personal affair, so shut up 
within each individual engaged in it, so dependent on per- 
sonal differences in capacity, that people generally have been 
slow to comprehend the principles of the art, or that there is 
an art. Even when some individual shows splendid results 
from the wise use and development of his mind, we are prone 
to ascribe his success to inborn genius.
-P-A-G-E-11
  
THE ART OF LEARNING 3 
Learning and progress. The importance of these better 
ways of learning, if they can be found and mastered, it is 
unnecessary to argue. There is no human being in any field 
of endeavor or walk of life whose success in attaining the 
things he wants and whose worth to himself and to his fellow 
men is not determined directly by his success in learning the 
things it is necessary for him to know or to do to attain 
that success. Learning is the foundation of every art and 
every achievement. It is the one great business of childhood 
and youth and the sole means of progress at every age. Not 
one of us by taking thought can add a cubit to his physical 
stature, but each of us by taking thought most certainly can 
add to and multiply that which is far more important—his 
mental capacity and spiritual stature, his ability to learn and 
hence to know, to think, and to do, and therefore to attain or 
to accomplish whatever things are most worth while. 
Limits in learning. These laws of learning are not entirely 
unknown to anybody who knows anything. Birds can learn 
to fly, colts to run, and puppies to bark and bite. Every 
teacher and every pupil may use the best way sometimes, by 
chance. On the other hand, no human being has ever at- 
tained the ability to learn all’sorts of things always in the 
best possible way. No one who reads this book will be 
wholly ignorant of how to learn at the beginning nor nearly 
perfect in the art when he finishes; but vitally important for 
his success in life is the degree of his advancement along the 
line. Doubtless some have inherited greater possibilities for 
mental development than have others, but the most gifted 
often squander their powers through failure to make the best 
use of them, while those less favored far outstrip them by 
learning to make every effort count. One’s practical concern 
is not with the problem of what capacity he has inherited 
from his ancestors, but with the live question of what he can 
make of that which he has. Nothing he now can do can affect
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
the former problem ; everything he does will inevitably affect 
the latter. Neither problem can be solved except by the pur- 
poseful development of every capacity to the utmost. How- 
ever able one may now be to gather knowledge and to 
acquire skill and power, yet greater ability is within his 
reach. “To him that hath shall be given.” The more learn- 
ing skill one has, the more easily he can increase it. As there 
is no limit to the valuable things there are to learn, so there 
is no limit to the capacity one may develop for learning them. 
The limiting factors in learning achievement are found in the 
limits of one’s determination, his persistency, his confidence 
in his own capacity, his faith in himself. 
Not secrets but science. These better methods of learning 
are not chance discoveries nor patented devices. They are 
the scientific selection and ‘development of the methods 
which have evolved slowly out of the primitive efforts of the 
race. If they were tangible, material things which could be 
patented, manufactured, packed up in attractive cartons, and 
sold to the public, they would soon be in as general use as 
electric-light bulbs; but because they cannot be exploited, 
because they are things that one must do and not buy, be- 
cause they are not advertised on the billboards and in the 
newspapers, because they are made of ideas, purposes, and 
ambitions rather than wood, metal, and fabric, they cannot 
hope for sudden popularity or general adoption. Yet, in 
their values to their possessors they exceed all other modern 
devices. The mastery of the better modes of learning will 
not be attained by following any set of rules or by being 
initiated into the mysteries of any set of tricks. Certain 
“systems” of memory training and mental development are, 
indeed, widely advertised and sold. They have much value 
through their successful schemes of getting the learner to do 
the things they teach him that he should do. But learning 
power depends on no secrets or mysteries. It is a matter of
-P-A-G-E-13
THE ART OF LEARNING 5 
understanding and applying practically the established facts 
as to the nature and working of the mind. It is a practical 
knowledge and use of psychology—the science of the mind. 
What is mind? Just what we mean by mind is of little 
consequence here. It is a very difficult matter for the human 
mind to define itself. It is not at all necessary to define a 
thing in order to learn about it or to make the best use of it. 
We may very profitably study about and make use of light, 
heat, number, color, honor, hope, life, and other vital things 
without being able to define them. Neither is it necessary 
here to say just what psychology is. We can do that better 
after studying it than before. What is more important is to 
know how to study it to best advantage. With this end in 
view we shall give at the beginning of our study a few prac- 
tical directions, The purpose of these directions is threefold: 
first, that you may the more successfully study the book 
itself; second, and more important, that by consciously di- 
recting the use of your mind in this study you will better 
understand the mind you are using; third, and most impor- 
tant, that by beginning right now to learn as efficiently as 
possible, you will adopt the best way of learning to learn 
efficiently. The principles follow. 
Begin now. Mind, like muscle, increases its strength only 
when the strength it has is fully employed. To work below 
one’s capacity is to reduce that capacity. If you can lift a 
hundred pounds now, you will never get the ability to lift 
two hundred by lifting fifty. You can never improve the 
quality of your penmanship by writing below the level of 
the best that you can do. So you cannot hope to achieve 
better modes of learning unless you make use of the best you 
have. If you will begin at once to apply each of these prin- 
ciples of learning conscientiously and persistently, your 
learning power will be decidedly increased by the time you 
have finished the study of this book. But if you are unwilling 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  6 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
to make the effort to put into practice each new principle 
as you learn it, you will weaken your power either to learn 
principles or to put them into practice. The first principle 
for attaining greater mind and will power, greater ability to 
learn, is to use immediately what you have learned. Form 
the habit of seizing promptly upon every good method and 
making a habit of it. Begin now. 
Learn strenuously. Learning is activity. It is what one 
does, not what happens to him or is done to him. It depends 
not on what the teacher says or what the book contains, but 
on what the mind of the learner does in response to the 
teacher and the book. To the earnest student there is no such 
thing as absorbing knowledge; neither can it be crammed, 
instilled, drilled, poured, hammered, or driven in, except So 
far as these oft-used expressions really mean the activity of 
the learner’s own mind. Nor is knowledge or other men- 
tal ability added to the mind as bricks are added to a wall, 
by being stuck on by some mental mortar, but as limbs and 
fruit are added to a tree, by growth from within; or as 
strength is added to one’s biceps, by exercise and effort. 
Mind is not built. It grows; but it grows only by its own 
activity. Therefore, when you study or when you listen to 
instruction assume an active attitude. Key yourself up for a 
vigorous, aggressive, determined struggle for the mastery of 
ideas and the attainment of habits. Learn to work hard; it 
is the surest way to make your work easy. 
Question constantly. All real study is reasoning, and all 
true reasoning is asking and answering questions, setting and 
solving problems. You may read a simple story by passively 
letting the author carry you along as he chooses, but in a 
serious work from which you seek to gain knowledge, read- 
ing without a challenging question in mind is quite useless. 
Aimless reading accomplishes its aim—nothing. At every 
step in study, as in all intelligent work, one must know just
-P-A-G-E-15
  THE ART OF LEARNING 7 
what it is he is trying to do. What am I supposed to know 
from this paragraph? What is the author’s meaning in this 
statement? What have I gathered from this chapter? What 
are the important points in this passage? Which points 
should I remember? Which will be of service to me? How 
can I make use of them? These are the sort of questions 
with which one should be constantly checking up on his 
reading. In very easy reading the questions are often an- 
swered before they can be asked ; but where study is required 
the questions should be very definite and formal, even to the 
extent of being asked aloud by the reader and answered as 
definitely. Apply this sort of questioning to these chapters 
and see how much more clear and effective they become. 
Begin now to form the invaluable habit of keeping up a 
questioning attitude in all study. 
Organize. Organizing is essential to successful study. It 
consists in setting for oneself and solving the problem, “What 
are the main points of this selection and how are they related 
to each other?” Organizing is the reducing of the many 
details of a lengthy study or discussion to the few central 
points which are vital to it. It is the condensing of many 
things into a few, but these few such as to include the many. 
It is especially the relating of these essential points to each 
other and to the whole so that the whole is seen as a single 
unit and can be summarized in brief by the student. Thor- 
ough organization demands, further, that the reader see 
clearly the relation of the whole and its parts to such other 
related knowledge as he may have. Chapters, books, and 
scientific articles.are frequently organized by their authors, 
as an aid to the readers, in brief summaries placed at the 
beginning or close ; but for a student who is learning to think 
in a new subject, it is the act of organizing rather than a 
ready-made summary which is of value. The student’s mas- 
tery of a chapter can best be indicated by his ability to or- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
ganize it for himself. Form now the habit of pausing at the 
end of each chapter or other division of a book, or at the 
close of a lecture, to organize its contents in your mind. 
Outline. Outlines are perhaps the best method of making 
your organization clear and definite and of impressing it 
upon your mind. An outline is a brief organization reduced 
to writing in such form as to show clearly, at a glance, the 
relation of the parts to each other. By means of indention, 
numbering and lettering, underlining and similar devices, 
the outline should be a diagram of the thought of him who 
makes it. Like a good advertisement, an outline should 
show much white space in which the significant words stand 
out boldly and strike the eye with a force that cannot be 
ignored. Not only should the words that count most leap 
out from the page at the reader, but the relative position, 
grouping, and size of the writing should indicate unmistak- 
ably the relation of points to each other. The very few cen- 
tral heads lined up against the left margin should constitute 
in themselves a complete but very brief outline. The main 
subordinate points should show clearly by indention to what 
they are subordinate and the coédrdination among themselves. 
Minor points, put farther to the right, should modestly with- 
draw into smaller and very compact writing. Make your 
outline look like a skeleton of the lecture or selection as you 
feel it to be built up. Never let your outline degenerate into 
a mere copying down of headings or an unorganized list of 
topics strung along on a dead level. Let it be the diagram of 
your own thought. An outline is valuable for review and 
ready reference, but its greatest value is attained in the mak- 
ing of it. It necessitates clear thinking and insures a high 
order of remembering. The process of outlining may be slow 
and laborious at first, but skill and rapidity are quickly 
attained if you begin now and always do your best.
-P-A-G-E-17
THE ART OF LEARNING - 9 
Learn to take notes. Organizing and outlining attain their 
highest development and usefulness in the systematic taking 
of notes. No form of study affords a more vigorous mental 
exercise or insures a better training in close attention and 
rapid analysis than the taking of notes on a series of lectures. 
Intensity of concentration, quickness of comprehension, and 
rapidity of organization are essential to effective note-taking 
and may soon become a habit. To succeed at this art one 
must first see to his physical readiness. He must be seated 
in a good light and in a position favorable for easy hearing 
and rapid writing. Notebook and pencil or pen must be 
ready for business. If distractions due to such things cause 
one to miss the train of thought, he will find it hard to over- 
take. Necessary headings, such as date, subject, course, 
lecturer, etc., should be prepared in advance. The feeling of 
complete readiness helps much. Note-taking is far from be- 
ing a mere jotting down of phrases, scraps of ideas caught 
here and there on the fly, or the preserving of occasional 
bright sayings and witticisms. It is genuine, rapid organiz- 
ing and outlining. One must learn to select instantly the 
central and important points from the mass of illustrative 
and explanatory matter which accompanies them. These 
must be jatted down so quickly and automatically that one 
does not miss the next point or lose the connection. State- 
ments must be instantly condensed into the shortest possible 
phrases that contain the key words; whilé explanatory and 
illustrative matter must be duly subordinated by its position. 
The note-taker’s skill is in catching ideas as they come and 
pinning them down until he can develop them at his leisure. 
As soon as possible after the lecture, while impressions still 
are vivid, the student should study and develop his notes to 
make them permanently intelligible. Whatever points are 
not clear should be thought out until they become so. Incom- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
to PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
  plete words and statements must be filled out and important 
explanatory matter filled in. The codrdination and subordi- 
nation of the several points should be logically tested and 
corrected. Whatever is necessary should be added to make 
each point permanently clear and logically complete. Unless 
one has developed much skill in the art of note-taking, the 
notes should be copied carefully into a neat and permanent 
form. As in the making of the original notes, this develop- 
ment and copying is not to be valued for the written product 
but for the mental clarity attained in the process. If the in- 
structor does not examine or criticize the notes, if they are 
not required for review or in preparing for an examination, 
the conscientious student should take all the greater care in 
their development. The less likelihood there is of their being 
used in the future, the greater the importance of getting the 
mental values from their preparation now. 
Notes on reading. To the student who seeks the quickest, 
easiest, and surest way of grasping and impressing upon his 
mind the essentials of an article, chapter, or book, note- 
taking is an invaluable device. It protects him against wan- 
dering attention, that worst enemy of effective study; it 
clarifies meanings and relations and fixes the matter in his 
memory better far than many monotonous re-readings. Since 
the book, unlike the speaker, will patiently await the reader’s 
convenience and repeat as often as necessary, notes should 
be made complete and in final form without copying; other- 
wise they are not different from lecture notes. An important 
point, but one that is hard for the unpracticed student to 
appreciate, is that the harder the pressure of time or the 
greater the fatigue under which he is working, the greater the 
profit and economy that result from the taking of notes. 
Form of notes. The vital thing about the form of the notes 
is that they shall constitute a concise and clear-cut diagram 
of the student’s mind with reference to the topics covered.
-P-A-G-E-19
THE ART OF LEARNING Il 
Essentials should stand out on the page so vividly as to 
strike one at first glance. Minor points should be unobtru- 
sively tucked away under their appropriate major headings. 
The student may well cultivate a very compact, clear script 
exclusively for use in note-taking. One may learn to increase 
and decrease the size of the script to correspond with the 
importance of the point as automatically as he raises or 
lowers his voice in speaking. Underlining, single and double, 
is used to stress further the key words and phrases. Liberal 
margins and much blank space left by the pronounced inden- 
tions make for clearness, while a solid mass of writing indi- 
cates poor analysis. Whatever form is used should be used 
consistently and persistently until it becomes a habit and 
takes care of itself. 
A particularly useful acquisition for the student is a fixed 
system of abbreviations. This system should grow according 
to the individual’s needs, and will vary largely according to 
the subjects in which he is working. The important thing is 
that abbreviations be employed for words which will be used 
frequently and which are long enough for a real saving of 
labor and space to be achieved. This is particularly true of 
technical words in the sciences. It is absolutely essential 
that the same sign be used always and only for the same 
word; otherwise more time will be lost in using and reading 
them than is saved. New forms will be added and old ones 
dropped from the working list as the subject matter of the 
notes varies. The writer regularly uses psy for psychology, 
psy! for psychological, ed for education, ed! for educational, 
ed” for educative, tchr for teacher, tchg for teaching, etc. 
There are also some shorter words used so frequently as to 
make abbreviation profitable; for example, w for with, wh 
for which (but never who, what, when, where, why, or any- 
thing else). All standard abbreviations are used, but nearly 
always without periods. A series of hooks and circles bor-  
-P-A-G-E-20

rowed from stenography may well be used for common suf- * 
fixes ; as, -tion, -ness, etc. One who can use stenography may 
well do so for notes which he alone is to use, but it is not 
necessary. Properly. used abbreviations are usually easier 
to read than the words fully written out. 
Concentrate. A condition essential to successful study is 
concentration. This depends on the basic fact of attention— 
that the mind does but one thing ai a time and that it has 
little power of achievement when it shifts frequently from 
one thing to another. If your mind is on your dinner, the 
ball game, the temperature of the room, the pen you are 
using, the discomfort of the chair, or what your roommate is 
saying or doing, it is not learning your lesson or mastering 
the task you have set it. Get your pen and light and 
chair and clothing and the temperature as you want them, or 
else deliberately and determinedly ignore them. Close the 
door and hang out the “Busy. No visitors welcome” sign. 
Silence your roommate or ignore him. If there is any dis- 
traction which you cannot control, “forget it.” Decide care- 
fully which task is entitled to the right of way and then get 
yourself so absorbed in it that no other exists for you until 
the job is done or the allotted time has expired. Hesitation, 
indecision, dawdling, make for low-grade intellect and fail- 
ure, but the habit of concentration is the key to success. 
Begin now to make concentration a habit. 
No impression without expression. : Even though this well- 
known pedagogical maxim may seem to you somewhat 
exaggerated, you may be certain that the surest way to get 
a thing thoroughly impressed upon the mind is to give ex- 
pression to it. The chief purpose of making an outline is 
to impress the organization upon your mind. Remember 
that you get ideas by means of what you do with them, 
not by what they.do to you. The more positively, definitely, 
and vigorously you do something with an idea, the more
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE ART OF LEARNING 13 
clearly and permanently you learn it. If you would learn to 
do a thing, do it. “We learn to do by doing.” If you would 
clarify and vivify what you are trying to learn, explain it to 
someone else or write it with care and precision. Especially 
the hard points which elude your grasp and those important 
ones which should become very familiar should be written 
out with particular care and faithfulness. Seek every oppor- 
tunity to explain and discuss in class the things you are try- 
ing to learn. If you know them, this will fix the knowledge; 
if they are not clear, this will help to make them so. Much of 
the best study is done by working in pairs and groups, but 
it is the one who does the explaining that gets the greater 
value. If you cannot explain or argue with others, explain to 
yourself. Argue it out with the author. Challenge his state- 
ments and make him prove them. Talk back to him and in- 
sist on his points being made clear to you. When you have 
an idea straight, do something with it. This means work. It 
is strenuous activity ; but nothing else is successful learning. 
There are easier ways of spending time; but there is no 
easier way of learning and hence of shortening the study 
time or increasing the results of it.

you can readily apply all of them continuously. 
8. If you find it impossible to apply any principle to any par-

Is it because the text has already done the organizing, outlining, etc. 
for you? because the lecture is so difficult or so vague that you are 
unable to organize it? because the principle is not clear to you? be- 
cause you cannot concentrate sufficiently to apply the principle?

apply any or all of the principles, state definitely the reasons for your 
conclusions. 
10. Define, in writing, organization, outline, concentration, ex-

  CHAPTER II 
THE BASIS OF LEARNING © 
All learning is a connecting. (What one cannot do he 
acquires the ability to do only by trying to do it} At each 
trial he does as nearly as he can the thing he seeks to do. 
Each effort leaves an:increased power to do it as well as he 
has already done, and this serves as a stepping-stone toward 
doing yet more nearly the thing intended. The new power 
consists in new associative connections or bonds left as the 
result of each act of trying. One learns his way through a 
problem or subject of study by first thinking out one rela- 
tion between ideas and then another until the whole has been 
connected up. These connections between ideas are retained 
in the mind inseparable from and, indeed, a part of the ideas 
themselves. One learns a science by getting certain, experi- 
ences through the senses and then thinking these together 
into systems of thought. A language is learned by thinking 
the words heard or seen into connections with the ideas they 
represent and thinking these together into phrase and sen- 
tence meanings. One learns to write by getting separate 
movements and connecting these up by practice into series 
so that these groups of motions act together as single move- 
Bates all learning is a connecting-up, a joining together, 
of ideas, movements, emotions, and the like; and the success 
of the learning is precisely in the definiteness with which 
these connections are made and the permanence with which 
they are retained. All mental life is but some form of unify- 
ing, integrating, or joining together, and psychology studies 
the kinds and qualities thereof.

  THE BASIS OF LEARNING 17 
, Physical functions. But to understand such a description 
/of learning it is necessary to examine the physiological 
foundations upon which it rests, and this is our present pur- 
pose. As we all know, the body consists of bones, muscles, 
nervous system and sense organs, the skin and other protec- 
tive tissues, and the various glands, tracts, and muscular 
organs of the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems. 
Of these, the bones and protective tissues have no inde- 
pendent power of movement whatever. The vital organs 
have their various movements by means of the muscles of 
which they are composed, stimulated and controlled by cer- 
tain automatic parts of the nervous system. They, however, 
know their business thoroughly and have nothing to learn. 
They ask only proper nourishment and wholesome condi- 
tions of exefcise and rest to perform faithfully their duties 
of attending to the internal affairs of the body. The muscles 
are the instruments of movement. No bodily movement of 
any sort takes place except by the contraction or relaxation 
of muscles—whether it is the beating of the heart, the 
swinging of an ax, the winking of an eye, or the faintest trace 
of a smile; and every movement is directed and controlled 
by nerve activity. So far as the muscles are directly con- 
cerned in the process of learning, there is nothing that we 
can do for them except to increase their strength by whole- 
some nourishment, exercise, and rest. There is nothing that 
a muscle can do but to contract and to relax. When, to what 
extent, and in what combinations these contractions and 
relaxations shall occur is determined solely by the nerve 
control. As for the sense organs, they are specially developed 
endings of the sensory nerves more or less equipped with 
muscles for better adapting them to their tasks. They will 
\ be described in a later chapter. 
¢ All learning is neural. To learn is to receive from present 
experiences effects which will guide in future actions. The  
-P-A-G-E-26
18 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
  nervous system is the only part of the physical organism 
directly involved in learning.’ It alone can receive and retain 
the~records of what one does or experiences. It alone can 
control and direct one’s movements. Objects and conditions 
in the world about us are the occasion of our actions, and 
these are made known to us by means of the ingoing nerve 
currents which they stimulate through the organs of sense— 
the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the skin, etc. Learning 
about these objects around us consists in organizing and 
retaining the sensations set up by the sense currents in such 
form as will make them of permanent service to us. Move- 
ments are produced by some combination of muscular con- 
tractions under the stimulation of outgoing currents of 
nervous energy. Learning to make a movement consists in 
getting control of these stimulating currents. ‘ 
Neurones.’ The nervous system, like all forms of living 
matter, is composed of minute cells, each cell being a tiny 
1This chapter assumes so much knowledge of the physiology of the 
nervous system as is ordinarily included in a good school course. While 
even this knowledge is not directly involved in the discussion, a review of 
the chapter on this subject in a good physiology text would aid the student 
greatly in a clear and vivid understanding of this and subsequent chapters. 
Some of the more important points regarding the general structure are in- 
cluded in the following summary. Any statement in this summary or in 
the text which is not clear to the student should be worked out from a 
physiology text. 
PuystoLocicaL Summary. The nervous system consists of gray matter 
and white matter. The part which is composed mainly of the body por- 
tions of the countless cells (neurones) takes on the gray color, while that 
which consists of the fibrous extensions of these same cells is white because 
of the medullary coverings of the fibers. These medullary sheaths or cover- 
ings correspond rather closely in form and function to the insulating cover- 
ings of electric wires. The long threadlike nerves, which are readily visible 
to the eye, are bundles of such fibers wrapped in a common protective 
sheath, like the many wires gathered under a single insulating cover in a 
telephone cable. Connection between cell and cell occurs mainly by shorter 
fibers in the centers where the cell bodies are grouped together. These 
centers are called ganglia. Many of these ganglia distributed through the
-P-A-G-E-27
  THE BASIS OF LEARNING 19 
sacklike structure containing protoplasmic substance and 
having a vital germ or nucleus. A nerve cell is called a 
eurone, and differs from other kinds of living cells in that 
it is drawn out into at least two long and much-branched 
fibers. It differs also from other sorts of cells in that’ its 
function is not to attain growth by increasing in size nor by 
multiplying and reproducing its kind, nor yet to do work by 
contraction and expansion like a muscle cell, but to trans- 
mit to neighboring neurones the nerve currents which it 
receives. The neurone may absorb and weaken or it may re- 
enforce and strengthen the passing current, but the fact with 
which we are primarily concerned in learning is that, by 
means of the countless branches of its fibrous extensions, 
unlimited variations in the series of connecting neurones 
over which the current may pass are possible. Each tiny 
neurone has one or more dendrites. (fibers branching and 
subdividing like a tree) over which the current enters the 
cell body. Each has a single axon over which the current 
system are concerned only with more or less local reflex movements. The 
spinal cord and its enlarged upper end, the medulla oblongata, serve both 
as ganglionic centers and as main fiber tracts; but incomparably the most 
important ganglion is the brain itself, of which the whole external portion 
consists of a gray mass of cell bodies. The interior structure of the brain 
is mainly composed of great groups of fibers (white matter) connecting in 
countless combinations the various portions of the surface with each other 
and with the incoming (sensory) and outgoing (motor): nerves, 
The main or upper portion of the brain is known as the cerebrum, and 
in its outer (ganglionic or gray) part occurs the nerve activity which is 
involved in all mental or conscious processes. This outer portion of the 
cerebrum is known as the cortex, hence we have the terms cortical activity, 
cerebral activity, cerebration, etc., meaning the nerve activity which is in- 
volved in thought, feeling, and other forms of consciousness. 
Quite definite portions of the area of the cortex are connected with and 
function for the several sense organs and for different portions of the body. 
Other areas are concerned only with the combinations or associations in- 
volved in thought processes. An injury to any definite portion of the 
cortex, or its destructioh by disease, results in paralysis of the function 
which depends on that particular part.

may pass out at many different points. It has been estimated 
that there may be some eleven thousand million of these 
neurones in the nervous system of a human being. As each 
may have from a very few to perhaps hundreds of different 
fibrous endings over which the current may enter or leave it, 
and as each different ending might connect with a different 
neighboring neurone, and each of these in turn may connect 
with as many other different ones, and so on through the 
whole supposed eleven billions, one can easily see that the 
number of different combinations of connections that might 
be made among them is practically infinite. Twenty-six 
letters of the alphabet are combined into half a million words 
in one language alone. Who can say how many millions of 
words might be made up with them? But if we had thou- 
sands of millions of letters and each might be used in perhaps 
hundreds of different ways, and they could all be combined 
in every sort of way, the number of words that could be 
formed would be unthinkable. So the possible number of 
different chains of connected neurones which constitute the 
possible paths for the passing of the nerve currents through 
the nervous system is beyond all calculation or guessing. 
_-Synapses. But the connections among these neurones must 
not be thought of as positive and continuous, like the pipes 
of a water system nor like the wires of an electric system. 
Probably no two neurones are actually attached the one to 
the other. The current passes from the axon of one neurone 
to the dendrite of another in the series by an infinitely close 
approach of fiber to fiber without actual contact. The situa- 
tion may be compared with the interlacing twigs of neighbor- 
ing trees, intimately intermingled but never grown together. 
These synapses, or synaptic connections, have one remark- 
able characteristic upon which depends all our awareness of 
the outer world, all consciousness or mental life, all direction 
and coérdination of muscular movement, all possibility of

system estimated to have at least eleven billion neurones. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE BASIS OF LEARNING 21 
learning. Whenever the current of nerve energy passes from 
neurone to neurone at a given synapse, from the fibrous end 
of an axon to the fibrous end of a dendrite, these two endings 
seem to be brought closer together or otherwise affected so 
that subsequent currents pass more readily and easily over 
that same synapse. The next passage of the current leaves 
the synapse yet stronger and closer, and the next, and the 
next likewise, until, by the repeated use of this particular 
synapse as a bridge for the passage of the current, it becomes 
to all intents and purposes a solid continuous connection of 
one fiber to the other, offering no resistance to the smooth 
flow of energy from neurone to neurone. <i 
Neural paths. Presumably a synapse never loses its origi- 
nal character of being merely a close approach of fibers to 
each other; yet when a series of neurones are connected to- 
gether in a chain or combination by thoroughly established 
synapses, they afford such a perfect pathway for the easy 
flow of the.current that they act together as one, like the 
combination of different wires which bring the current from 
the power house to your study light. Thereafter we need 
but to make sure of the current’s getting in at one end of the 
series to be certain of its making its exit at the other end. 
We shall see as we proceed that all learning may be regarded 
as the process of getting these synaptic paths established in 
the nerve system. 
Neural energy. The nerve current of which we have been 
speaking is a form of energy akin to an electric current. 
Probably it is chemical activity accompanied by electrical 
effects. For our purposes here we may regard it as much the 
same sort of current that passes over a telephone or other — 
electric wire. As the electric current may be produced by 
various types of machines driven by the muscle power of 
men or animals, by falling water, by expansion due to heat or 
explosion of gases, by a galvanic battery or otherwise, so the  
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
nerve current may originate in many different forms of physi- 
cal or chemical energy, such as light, sound or heat waves, 
physical contact, etc., transformed by the sense organs of 
sight, hearing, touch, taste, or smell into the mysterious flow 
of energy which traverses the synaptic paths in the nervous 
system. It is switched from path to path in the cerebral 
centers as the electric current is redirected in a gigantic 
switchboard. And as the invisible, silent force which runs 
along our electric wires is converted by appropriate attach- 
ments into light, or heat, or power, so nerve energy appears 
again in the outer world as movements and the expression 
of ideas utterly unlike the current itself. 
Sensory-motor arc. In the lowest forms of life possessing 
a nerve equipment the current enters from the physical 
environment through a sense-receiving organ, or “receptor,” 
and passes immediately over its prepared pathway and out 
into the muscles which produce the movement necessary to 
make the appropriate adjustment. Thus nature has provided 
a simple machinery by which the creature is adapted to the 
conditions in which he is placed. This complete passage of 
the nerve current in, through, and out is known as a sensory- 
motor circuit or arc. In more highly organized forms of life 
the incoming sensory stimulations are more highly refined 
and differentiated, the muscular movements better codr- 
dinated and adapted, but the main difference is in the elabo- 
rate internal organization for suppressing, reénforcing, and 
redirecting the currents. This central control corresponds to 
consciousness and intelligence. However simple or complex 
it may be, the sensory-motor circuit consists of (1) the stimu- 
lation of the sensory organ and the in-going (afferent, or 
sensory) current; (2) the associative control or redirection 
in the central neurones; and (3) the outgoing (efferent, or 
motor) current and its arousing the muscle to action. This 
sensory-motor arc is the unit of complete neural action. It is
-P-A-G-E-33
  
THE BASIS OF LEARNING 23 
nature’s gift to all sentient creatures by which they are 
enabled to know the situations in which they are placed and 
to adapt themselves thereto for their own preservation and 
welfare. 
Transformation of energy. To continue our comparison, 
we know that the electric current as it passes along the wires 
is silent and invisible unless interrupted. At the terminals 
of the line it may by appropriate instruments be converted 
into light, heat, sound, power of various forms, chemical 
energy, and the like, even as by suitable generators it was 
derived from heat and power of diverse kinds. Thus far we 
have seen that it is quite comparable with neural energy. 
Furthermore, if the electric energy be slightly interrupted, 
not enough utterly to break the connection, it tends to jump 
the break, and in so doing some of its force is consumed in 
flashes of light with accompanying heat and sound. Likewise 
so much of the nerve current as passes through the cortical 
or upper brain regions seems to give rise, in its passage 
through the synapses there, to flashes of something quite 
different from either the stimulation or the muscular out- 
come of the:current itself. It is at this:point that conscious- 
ness—sensations, ideas, feelings, and the like—appears to 
come into being: Consciousness occurs only on the occasion 
of the passage of currents of nerve force through the synapses 
in the gray matter, or cortical cells, inthe brain. This, how- 
ever, is not equivalent to saying that this is what conscious- 
ness is. 
Organization of synapses. The starting-point for our sci- 
ence of learning is in the fact that all consciousness and all 
movement, and hence all learning and all knowledge and 
skill and capacity to do anything whatever, depend upon 
effective synaptic connections among the fibrous extensions 
of the neurones. So far as these ’synaptic paths are indefinite 
and unorganized, ideas are vague and movements are pur-
-P-A-G-E-34
  
  24 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
poseless and ineffective; so far as they are established in 
definite useful series, thought and rational conduct are pos- 
sible. An infant stimulated by a strong light, a sudden 
sound, or the point of a pin brings into activity impartially 
its arms, legs, body, head, facial muscles, and vocal organs. 
It wriggles and squirms and cries, but does nothing effective 
to improve the situation. Its synapses are not yet organized 
into definite paths of conduction for the nervous energy 
aroused, hence its movements are ineffective and its ideas 
and feelings too vague to be called intelligent. From this 
point the learning process begins. Out of the mass of use- 
less, excess movements one or more are effective. Whatever 
movement appears to the infant to contribute to an agree- 
able result is accompanied with a thrill of satisfaction. This 
thrill is nature’s “O.K.” on the particular combination of 
synapses involved in producing it. This quality which we 
call a “thrill” is not some mysterious or unusual thing, but 
simply that sense of success which comes to each of us when 
after some effort we make the move that gets the result 
sought. It is as though we had completed the circuit. It seems 
both to put force into the current, thus making stronger the 
synaptic bridges of this particular pathway, and to afford 
pleasure, which is nature’s way of getting the act repeated. 
Each repetition of the successful act is accomplished with 
less of effort and more of satisfaction and a constantly in- 
creasing tendency to repeat again. Meanwhile the synaptic 
pathway has become well established, and this much of the 
process called learning has been accomplished. 
Synapses and learning. Thus, one by one, little by little, 
slowly and laboriously, through the actual growing of nerve 
connections under the direction and stimulus of effortful 
activity, there are built up the innumerable complex codrdi- 
nations involved in turning the head, sitting, standing, walk- 
ing, running, talking, writing, playing ball, and all the

countless activities of childhood. Similarly, in certain areas 
of the cortex each thought and idea and every experience of 
the child’s mental life is leaving its physiological counterpart 
in the form of synaptic combinations. As these-are retained, 
memories are established, ideas are fixed and_ associated: 
Learning is going on, and knowledge and systems of thought 
are being built up. Just so, maturer learning is the business 
of setting up these cortical connections by means of effortful 
activity of mind and muscles. Every human power to think 
or to know or to do anything whatsoever is stored up physi- 
ologically in this growing complex of effective synapses. This 
is education. 
Control of synaptic connections. How to make the syn- 
apses when and where we will is the problem of teaching as 
it is of learning. As Professor Adams suggests, “there is no 
painless way of trepanning children so that we can get at 
their brains with our instruments and reagents,” nor, if we 
could do so, is there a single muscular movement or idea 
whose underlying synapses the wisest psychologist could 
recognize in the brain by aid of his finest instruments. 
We may not get at the brain connections directly, but indi- 
rectly we may know positively just how to secure the fixing 
of the particular set of synapses which function for the cor- 
rect spelling of a word, the right formation of a letter, the 
exact association of ideas which will solve a mathematical 
\\ problem or translate a Latin: sentence. es form the inner 
connections by performing the outward cts) We learn to 
do by doing.) We may profitably compare the process with 
the task of an electrician in wiring up one of those elaborate 
electric signs which spell out words in letters of light or 
flash on one picture or legend after another. The wires must 
be connected up in complex series so that when the current 
is turned on, all the mechanical switches will operate with 
their proper coédrdination and will illuminate the hundreds ©

of lamps in just the desired groupings and series. But there 
is this striking difference, that the electrician must connect 
up the wires in order to turn on his lights, while, to cor- 
respond with the process of making synaptic connections, it 
would be by turning on each light that he would make its 
connection. If turning on the lights in just the order and 
combination desired would make the connections among the 
hidden wires so that they would thereafter bring about the 
same result by the mere switching on of the current, his task 
would be quite comparable with that involved in making 
neural pathways by performing the acts which they are 
destined to make possible. This is precisely what is involved 
in thé process of learning. 
Making pathways permanent. The permanency of the 
connections is determined by the energy and the frequency 
with which the connections are made. This is a question not 
merely of the repetition and the strenuosity of the acts by 
which they are learned but also of the agreeableness of the 
process, for it must be remembered that satisfaction in the 
accomplishment is nature’s mode of registering approval and 
invigorating the current which establishes the learned con- 
nections. Correspondingly, unpleasantness or disagreeable- 
ness in the learning process is marked physiologically by a 
shrinking back of the fibers at the synapses and thus by a 
more or less positive interruption of the current. In the 
lower forms of life this pleasantness and unpleasantness are 
the only guides the creature has as to what conduct should 
be persisted in and what should be avoided. In human life 
intelligence affords a better foresight of what things should be 
learned. The pathways that are to be made permanent must 
be used repeatedly, energetically, and, if possible, pleasantly. 
Disconnecting. Synaptic bonds once established are nor- 
mally disconnected only by long disuse. Widespread and 
uncontrollable disintegration of neural organization may be

caused by shock, drugs, or disease, but a definite thing can- 
not be unlearned at will. Deliberate effort may connect 
things in some new and more desirable way, but it cannot 
break the old connections. There can be no science of 
unlearning except two simple principles: (1) discontinue 
absolutely, completely, and without exception the objec- 
tionable thought or activity, and thus cease using the unde- 
sired pathways; (2) keep the energy fully occupied in 
making and using desirable connections. So long as there is 
life, there must be activity. Energy is present and must and 
will be doing something. Learning there will be of some sort, 
for each discharge of neural energy must pass over some com- 
bination of neural paths, and each passage leaves its traces 
in strengthened synapses, more insistent tendencies and 
memories, be they wise or unwise, useful or destructive. The 
best defense against learning that which should not be 
learned is in keeping the energy busied in learning that 
which should be learned. 
Nerve versus mind. We must be cautious in making 
statements about the precise relation between the nervous 
system and’ consciousness itself; that is, the mind in all 
its activities, sensations, memories, emotions, feelings, ideas, 
thoughts, purposes, and what not. We know that there is no 
consciousness without nerve_activity, “no psychosis without 
néurosis,” that certain specific nerve activities are accom- 
panied by correspondingly specific mental processes, that the 
injury of certain definite nerve areas always produces like 
effects on consciousness. But nerves are physical things; 
they have dimensions, weight, color, some degree of hardness 
or softness, and other physical properties; they can be 
analyzed into oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and other chemical 
elements. Mind-stuff, however, such as ideas, sensations, 
feelings, and the like, has no size nor location, no weight, 
color, nor any physical property or chemical composition.    
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  28 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
This does not mean that it is so fine (like air or vapor) that 
we cannot perceive its qualities through our sense organs. 
It means positively that it has no such qualities. It is abso- 
lutely nowhere. It has no size. Physical terms simply have 
no meaning in connection with mind, any more than one can 
say how many tons a day weighs or how many feet long is a 
year. Just what this mind-stuff is we all know better than we 
know anything else. It is just the pain, the pleasure, the 
thought, the wish, and such like experiences that make up 
our waking life, but we cannot describe it in terms of any- 
thing else but just what it is. 
Nerve activity and thought. Can you think of any two 
things more utterly unlike each other than the mocking bird 
hopping about in the rosebush just outside my window and 
that slight chemical or electrical activity going on in the back 
part of my brain to which the visual stimulus of the bird 
gives rise? Or could anything be more unlike either the 
brain activity or the real physical bird than is the mental 
vision of it that I have? Yet if the brain activity did not 
occur, there could be no mocking bird for me; there would 
be no mind-stuff at all. Life would be as blank and meaning- 
less to me as it is to the rosebush or as existence is to a brick 
in the wall. How the one can cause the other, if it does, or 
why either should be at all, are among the divine mysteries 
before which we stand in awe and reverence. With infi- 
nite gratitude we accept the sublime fact of our physical and 
mental selves as it stands and proceed to the practical prob- 
lem how to make the most of them. We shall feel free to 
speak of a nerve activity causing an idea or vice versa, or we 
may say they accompany each other, or even speak as though 
we regard them as one and the same identical thing, which- 
ever way may seem most convenient for the moment’s dis- 
cussion, realizing fully that there is nothing in common 
between them except that they are inseparable.

  CHAPTER III 
THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL 
The starting-point. With the infant’s first experience 
there begins the process of making and organizing the 
synapses which shall determine the pathways over which 
subsequent currents of nerve energy shall pass. Fortunately 
for his success he does not begin from a zero point. He starts 
out with an equipment of nerve development sufficient to 
provide for those acts essential to an infant existence. He 
comes into the world with a nerve system as ready to per- 
form its functions as is his digestive or circulatory system 
or his muscles. So much of it as is concerned with the direc- 
tion of the vital processes develops of its own accord, regard- 
less of learning experiences. One does not need to learn to 
operate his heart, stomach, or the muscles involved in swal- 
lowing, breathing, and the like. 
Instinctive reflexes. Aside from this neural equipment for 
the vital processes, there are also numerous inborn tenden- 
cies to respond in particular ways to specific external stimuli. 
Many of these are simple reflex acts; that is, those in which 
an object or sensation sets up a muscular response directly 
without involving any conscious control—an act in which 
the nerve current is short-circuited, as it were, from the 
stimulus directly to the responding muscle through the lower 
ganglia. Such an instinctive reflex would be crying, sneez- 
ing, winking, sucking, swallowing, grasping, or jerking away 
the hand when pricked or burned. These inherited reflexes, 
like the vital processes, do not need to be learned. The actu- 
ating nerve connections are complete at birth or as soon as 
the muscular machinery is ready for use. 
"i \2 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32. PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
/ Instincts of imperfect functioning. From these definite 
and involuntary acts there is a long range of inborn tenden- 
cies requiring more or less of learning effort and of conscious 
purpose, such as turning the head, sitting up, crawling, walk- 
ing, talking, playing, and limitless complex activities. As 
soon as the child has developed sufficient bony structure and 
muscular strength to begin to walk, he has also the necessary 
nerve machinery to direct the movements, but at first this 
lacks codrdination, and numerous efforts directed by a more 
or less clear conscious purpose are necessary for him to learn 
to walk. In such a process as talking the inherited tendency 
is even less complete, and could never attain to practical 
functioning in any individual without much instruction and 
learning effort. What is inherited is merely an impulse to 
communicate and the machinery of the vocal organs. The 
manipulation of the organs necessary to articulate words and 
the fitting of words to ideas require years of effort and guid- 
ance. All the activities of life, including the most complex 
and subtle, involve some element of inherited impulse to- 
gether with a greater or less degree of organization of the 
nervous machinery through the various processes of learning. 
\Y Deferred and transitory instincts. The name instinct is 
applied to every inherited tendency to action. Every such 
tendency has its physiological groundwork in the inherited 
organization of the nervous system. Some instincts, we have 
seen, are simple and definite; some are very complex and 
vague. Some are fully organized and functioning at birth; 
others ripen at various later periods in life when the organs 
involved have sufficiently developed to make the tendency 
effective and the needs of the organism have made it neces- 
sary. Some, like the playing and crying of childhood, ap- 
pear for a season and pass. away when their usefulness is 
over. Hair, teeth, and beard make their appearance each in 
its own allotted time, organs develop and mature, the frame  
-P-A-G-E-43
  
THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL 33 
changes its form through infancy, childhood, youth, ma- 
turity, and the decay of old age, all in obedience to inborn 
laws. So the interests, impulses, ambitions, and tendencies 
of whatever sort which direct our activities go through their 
foreordained changes and developments in due time and 
order. That is to say, the nervous system grows, ripens for 
its various functions, changes, and finally falls into. decay, 
just as other parts of the organism do. 
Self-preservative instincts. We have distinguished in- 
stincts according to the order of their maturity. It is profit- 
able also to classify them according to their function in the 
welfare of the being to which they belong. Among the broad 
instinctive tendencies which nature has built deep into the 
nervous make-up of every creature and on which the very 
existence of each of us depends are those which are classed 
as self-preservative instincts. They may be simple reflexes 
like dodging a_missile or screaming,-or the resistless impulse 
of hunger which gives us no rest until the need for nourish- 
ment is satisfied ; fear which impels us to avoid some sorts of 
danger by escaping them, or combativeness—the fighting 
spirit—which enables us to avoid other dangers by meeting 
and overcoming them. Caution impels us to guard against 
dangers which may not be visibly present; acquisitiveness 
leads us in time of plenty to provide against future needs; 
ambition drives us to seek leadership over others. The list 
is endless. 
Race-preservative instincts. There are instinctive im- 
pulses which lead a creature in due time to find its mate and 
to rear up offspring, that the race may not cease with the 
individuals ; parental love, by which the young are protected 
and nourished until they are prepared to take up in their 
turn the responsibilities for self-preservation and the bring- 
ing up of the next generation. The nesting instinct in birds 
and the home-making in humanity are expressions of this
-P-A-G-E-44
  34 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
noble tendency. Family life and the art and literature of 
love are among its beautiful products. 
Social or race-uplifting instincts. The tendency to race 
preservation also takes many broader forms which contrib- 
ute to making the race better, more worthy to be preserved ; 
better fitted not only to survive the physical dangers which 
threaten primitive man on every side but to make life easier, 
happier, nobler—more and more a life of spiritual excellence 
rather than a mere struggle for existence. Herds of animals, 
tribes, villages, nations, and governments of men are evi- 
dences of this inborn tendency. Governments and society 
require for their existence the genius to organize, lead, and 
tule, and the willingness to submit, to obey, and to sacrifice 
individual desires and even life itself in the service of the 
common good. Respect for law and for the forms of govern- 
ment, for the rights of others, and for social customs; hon- 
esty; honor and the sense of duty; chivalry; reverence for 
purity, truth, and right; the subjection of selfish and animal 
impulses to those that are lofty and fine,—these are some of 
the tendencies which make for the higher welfare of the race. 
Some of these might be separately classed as moral instincts 
and others still as religious, but a complete classification is 
not our present purpose. Many other lines of distinction 
might be drawn with equal justification. No one classifica- 
tion can be complete or final or correct to the exclusion of 
any other classification which serves some useful purpose. 
One other grouping, however, is worth while here. 
Adaptive instincts. This term is applied to all those in- 
born tendencies which impel the individual to activities 
which result in learning; in profiting by the experiences of 
the race for the development of his own capacities. Among 
these are the child’s impulses to imitate and to play, by which 
he gets invaluable training in the activities which prepare 
him for the needs of his later life; curiosity, by which he is
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL 35 
impelled incessantly to gather knowledge; and his desire for 
expression, through which he clarifies his knowledge and 
trains himself in the ability to communicate his thoughts. 
Instincts not distinct. It must not be thought that any 
instinct is a separate or disconnected thing in itself. It has 
no separate existence like the heart or lungs; nor, except pos- 
sibly in the case of simple instinctive reflexes, is it resident 
in a single set of synapses. It is not usually any definite 
kind of act, but rather a vague tendency to a certain attitude 
under certain conditions. Any tendency of any sort which we 
may be able to distinguish in the conduct of a person may be 
regarded as instinctive to the extent that we believe it to be 
due to inherited influences rather than to influences acquired 
after birth. As every individual has countless variations in 
his own tendencies, and no two people are just alike, there 
are as many different sorts of tendencies, either inborn or 
acquired, as one may have the skill and patience to dis- 
criminate and name. Few acts of mature life may be re- 
garded as mainly instinctive, because of the large element 
of learned activities which inevitably enter into them. 
Motives of all conduct. Nevertheless, there enter into all 
conduct of whatever kind some instinctive influences. Back 
of everything we do is a cause in the form of that vital push, 
blind instinct more or less educated to rational efficiency. 
It may often occur that we can define the impulse no more 
definitely than to call it mere restlessness, the impulse to be 
doing something rather than nothing. It may be that in- 
tangible force for which we have no better name than virility, 
the tendency to realize one’s idea of being a man, to be big, 
strong, capable, to count for something in the affairs and 
doings of men. Or it may be any of the countless variations 
of inborn impulses to which any of hundreds of different 
names have been or may be given. Education gives the 
direction and form to one’s acts, but the reason for one’s
-P-A-G-E-46
ee oe a en ae 
36 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
acting at all, the primary force that makes things go, the real 
motive power for all conduct, is found somewhere deep down 
below the surface in these instinctive impulses. The instinct 
itself is just an impulse, a vague push or pull toward some 
general type of conduct. It cannot function, except in the 
vital processes and reflexes already described, until some 
executive machinery has been set up through the process we 
call learning. It may function well or poorly, it may attain 
the sort of end toward which it pushes or it may miss it 
entirely, it may become a permanent and dominating influ- 
ence in one’s life or it may atrophy and cease to function at 
all, according to the training and encouragement it may re- 
ceive. Education is the business of making instincts capable 
and useful for good. Through miseducation or neglect an 
instinctive tendency may result in acts which defeat its very 
purpose. A lie told from the impulse to avoid the pain of a 
whipping may get a whipping for the original offense and 
another for the lie. A dealer cheats in weight to gain a few 
cents and thus loses business at a cost of many dollars. A 
nation rushes into war to satisfy the lust of conquest and is 
made to suffer humiliation and penalties for generations. 
Morally indifferent. Instincts in themselves are neither 
good nor bad, neither moral nor immoral. Regarding them 
as the one or the other has led to no small confusion in some 
ethical philosophies. They are simply forces, forms of 
energy, and have no more moral quality than gunpowder, 
dynamite, wind, or the flow of a stream. Whether these 
forces are good or bad is a question of what use is made of 
them. There is no such thing as an instinct to lie or to steal. 
There is an inborn desire for sweets which may find expres- 
sion in taking jam from the pantry shelf, even in the face of 
parental forbidding. The jam is a very real and powerful 
stimulus, while the idea of right is somewhat hazy, and the 
fear of punishment exists only in dim memory or still dimmer

imagination. The jam wins. The act is done by virtue of the 
same impulse which would have prompted a bee or a mouse 
to have done the same thing or have impelled one to sweeten 
his coffee. It becomes immoral only because there are cer- 
tain rules of society or of the family to which this instinct 
should have been subordinated. When called to account, our 
misguided child denies his guilt. He lies—a distinctly im- 
moral act; but the impulse again is a perfectly natural and 
commendable one to avoid physical injury or parental dis- 
pleasure. The impulse to honesty should have been stronger 
through more effective training. Honesty is a very abstract 
and sublimated sort of impulse. It is invaluable in estab- 
lishing a basis of sound society or family life and should 
be developed at whatever cost. But it can be counted on only 
when it has been encouraged and developed by much exercise. 
Even honesty may become an agency of brutally unkind 
and unsocial conduct. A careful study of the instinctive 
springs of conduct and the means of their harmonious devel- 
opment into thoroughly social and moral character is an 
important and profitable basis of education, but it is not the 
present theme and cannot be further developed here. 
All are educable. The next important characteristic of 
instincts which we must note is their universal capacity for 
development or suppression. The same impulse may find 
expression and exercise in countless different types of activ- 
ity. The impulse to secure the necessities and pleasures of 
life drives different individuals to make their living by every 
known form of work, from digging ditches to playing ball or 
writing poems. Similarly, a single activity may be the means 
of giving expression to a great variety of impulses. For 
example, writing may be the means of finding profit, amuse- 
ment, revenge, giving pleasure to others, or doing the noblest 
and most heroic deeds. Now the impulses which dominate 
in one’s life are those which have been trained through exer-  
-P-A-G-E-48
  38° PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
cise. They grow through successful use just as truly as does 
a muscle. That motive from which one is accustomed to act 
becomes the motive from which he acts most readily. Most 
of us know some individual who is so accustomed to do all 
things with an eye single to his own financial profit that we 
can scarcely credit any other motive for any act which he 
does. Again, others are so uniformly unselfish in what they 
do that even when appearances are quite the contrary we 
readily believe that the ultimate explanation will exonerate 
them from selfish intent. Such is our common faith in the su- 
premacy of an impulse which has been accustomed to prevail 
in the life of aman. Greed or licentiousness may rule in one’s 
life until all opposing impulses are powerless to assert them- 
selves; but by the same token one may live a life in which 
only beauty, kindness, social service, religious exaltation, or 
search for truth may be found as springs of conduct. A 
thoroughly sane and well-rounded life will seek a balance of 
impulses, having all of them associated with and giving rise 
to the sort of conduct that makes for the highest good of 
self, family, and society in general. The impulses which 
seem weak and ineffective will be encouraged to successful 
activity, while those which are too overbearing will be curbed 
and made subject to those which are nobler. 
Potentially good or bad. In thus speaking of impulses as 
noble and ignoble we do not contradict our former statement 
that instincts per se are neither good nor bad. An ignoble or 
antisocial impulse is ordinarily some self-preservative instinc- 
tive tendency which has been associated with a narrow or 
unworthy aim so closely that it cannot be dissociated. There 
is nothing ignoble in a desire for wealth. It is a means of the 
largest success and usefulness and may contribute greatly to 
the highest aims in life. But “the Jove of money is the root 
of all evil.” When acquiring wealth becomes an obsession, 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL 39 
there is no room left in one’s life for the very things to which 
it is normally a means. Unselfish love is the most beautiful 
flower of humanity, and the pure and lofty love of man and 
woman is the key to most that is finest in life, but its selfish 
indulgence leads to baseness and misery. A healthy appetite 
contributes to much of the joy of vigorous living, but the 
overpowering appetite of the gourmand or the drunkard is 
among the most destructive and bestial of human failings. 
Every instinctive tendency may be built up into a power for 
great good in life, a means of happiness and human uplift; 
but any one of them by lack of wise and careful direction may 
become a degradation and a curse. A slight study of com- 
parative religions proves that this one impulse—the religious 
—has played a conspicuous part in history, actuating the 
gross licentiousness of the worshipers of Moloch, the cruelty 
of the Inquisitions, the heroic but useless sacrifices of the 
Crusades and the ascetics, and the incomparable sublimity 
of the Hebrew prophets and of Jesus and his followers. The 
practical lesson from all this is that inborn impulses are not 
simply to be either gratified or suppressed, but that each one 
of them is, as it appears or ripens in every individual, to be 
held in leash and trained into its highest and noblest func- 
tioning. Better that any instinct should be atrophied through 
disuse than that its use should prove a degrading influence, 
but better yet that it should enrich and ennoble the life of 
its possessor. 
Human instincts are indefinite. Except for the movements 
of the vital organs upon which life itself depends and the 
few simple reflex acts which are necessary for the life of the 
little child, as we have seen, instincts are given to man only 
in a vague, unformed condition and must be trained in spe- 
cial channels and directed by conscious purpose upon specific 
objects in order to act. It is different with the lower animals.
-P-A-G-E-50
40 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
The bee, the fish, and the bird inherit wonderfully complex 
instincts, and they are definite and complete. These do not 
need to learn through long experience and guiding instruc- 
tion. The bee knows how to gather honey and make its 
comb, and the bird to build its nest as well the first time as 
after a lifetimé of experiences. As fast as their bones and 
muscles, or whatever bodily machinery is required, attain 
the requisite development, the nervous system too is com- 
plete in its synapses, and the corresponding movements are 
accurate and effective. They are spared the long period of 
immaturity and laborious learning which is necessary in 
man to make these inborn tendencies effective. Higher ani- 
mals inherit tendencies less completely formed than those of 
the lower types but more perfect and definite than those 
of man. 
The meaning of infancy. This large measure of incom- 
pleteness in the nervous organization of man and the higher 
animals at birth means helplessness and total dependence of 
the infant upon its parents. No living creature is so com- 
pletely helpless to care for itself as the human infant, and 
none requires nearly so long a time to reach a state of self- 
dependence. One effect of this infant helplessness is the 
necessity for family life with all the fine moral and social 
qualities which are essential to it and which make so power- 
fully for all that is best in human life. Another result is that 
the capacity and achievement and hence the destiny of each 
normal human being are dependent more upon the organiza- 
tion and completion of his neural equipment by means of 
education after birth than they are upon the original outfit 
bestowed upon them through heredity. This fact makes © 
education and learning the greatest of all human responsi- 
bilities or human privileges. Nature hands over the infant 
capable of becoming like a beast or like a god, and tells us
-P-A-G-E-51
  
THE ORIGINAL CAPITAL 4I 
to do our best with him. What happens from then on is the 
prime responsibility of each generation. 
Its opportunity. Without the long plastic period of in- 
fancy, during which the infant may be shaped for any des- 
tiny, each generation would be foreordained to be as their 
parents were, with only the slight variations possible to 
heredity. Such is the fate of animals and plants. So valuable 
is the growing and learning of this time of immaturity that 
nature has decreed that it shall not be devoted to the less- 
important concern of self-support and the providing for daily 
needs. The child cannot make a living; therefore he is free 
for the higher duty of learning to live. It is not his to “earn 
his bread by the sweat of his brow” nor to “replenish the 
earth and subdue it”; it is for him to produce the most 
complete and perfect body, mind, and spirit possible with 
his heredity and environment. 
Its responsibility. The most subtle and delicate, the most 
difficult and complex, the most tremendously important and 
worth while of all the businesses of mankind is that of child- 
hood—the making of the best possible men and women out 
of the raw material of infancy. As one grows older and gains 
wisdom through his experiences, mainly through his mis- 
takes, it is natural to regret the lost opportunities of youth. 
All of us see now where we could have lived our lives much 
more wisely if we only had the chance to do it over again. 
We deplore the folly of youth and puzzle over the conun- 
drum of life—why wisdom to guide our lives is given us at 
the end of life, when it is too late to use it, rather than at the 
beginning when one has such desperate need of it. Why is the 
great responsibility of life, the shaping of it, given to the help- 
less infant rather than to the wise-grown and time-hardened 
man? That is just why. Because he is time-hardened. We 
must not forget that wisdom consists precisely in those
-P-A-G-E-52
    42 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
- synapses which have been brought about by experience. 
Once they have been formed it is too late to unform them 
and make them over again in the same individual. We have 
no way of unlearning, ungrowing, unforming ourselves, and 
if we had we should simply unlearn, unform, ungrow the 
very wisdom which we need as guide for the relearning and 
regrowing. ; 
Infancy and the growth of the race. Yet nature has been 
so beneficent as to grant us this very boon, this supreme 
privilege of casting off the blunders of imperfect growth, the 
misformed and hardened synapses along with the corrupt 
and misgrown body, and to begin again with the guidance 
and wisdom accumulated in the previous growing up. This 
is the meaning of the generations of men. Instead of each of 
us struggling on through the ages, loaded down with the 
limitations and errors of his growing up, he is re-formed in 
his offspring—the next generation—and passes on the lessons 
he has learned through his hardships and blunders in the 
form of wise guidance, advice, discipline, and instruction. 
All the philosophy and literature and learning of all the ages 
is but the wisdom (or supposed wisdom) of former genera- 
tions passed on for the guidance of the present-and future. 
The work of teachers is none other than that of guiding and 
aiding the child in appropriating for himself as fully and as 
freely as possible from this limitless store of the riches of 
experience and wisdom accumulated through all the ages of 
humanity. Human progress consists in giving to this accu- 
mulated accomplishment the widest possible dissemination 
in each generation and in passing it on a little richer and 
fuller and finer. Through learning, the wisdom of the aged 
becomes the possession of youth. An individual could not 
make by his own efforts in a million years the progress which 
the race has made through systematic education in the past 
generation.

    CHAPTER IV 
SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 
The outlet of instinct to action. Instinct is blind. We 
have already noted that it knows not the right or wrong, 
neither can it see to direct its force in any effective way. 
Intelligence must furnish the guidance both as to ultimate 
values and as to practical working. The one is a matter of 
moral purpose, the other a problem of skill. At present we 
are concerned with the latter. We must find how these vague 
forces of life can be connected up with the practical work 
they are to do. The winds and streams, the energy buried in 
coal, petroleum, or gasoline, are comparable to the unhar- 
nessed forces of instinct. The engines and machines by 
which these forces are made to do the work useful to man 
serve the same sort of function as the skills and habits of 
action which are set up through our learning. 
Necessity of automatic processes. All our practical proc- 
esses, muscular or mental, involve more or less of elements 
which must function in a purely mechanical and automatic 
fashion. Such, for instance, are the strokes used in swim- 
ming, the skillful swinging of an ax, the formation of the 
letters in a written word, the spelling of common words, 
the combinations in addition and multiplication, the gram- 
matical structure of ordinary sentences. One has no time to 
consider the case of a pronoun to be used when he is speak- 
ing if he desires to have interested listeners, to recall the 
formation of a letter or its place on the keyboard of his 
typewriter if he is to write his thoughts efficiently, or to 
think up the product of six times seven if he is to use multi- 
45
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
plication in a practical way. Neither can he consider how he 
is to maintain his balance or to turn the handle bars when 
riding a bicycle, nor how to manipulate the clutch or steering 
gear when driving an automobile. These things must be 
absolutely automatic. One merely thinks what he wants to 
say or to write, where he wants to turn, to speed up, or to 
stop, and his well-formed habits do the rest. Skill in speak- 
ing, in writing, or in driving a car, or in anything else what- 
ever, consists precisely in a series of thoroughly automatic 
acts so codrdinated as to secure the desired results with the 
least expenditure of time and energy. These automatic proc- 
esses are what we know as habits. 
Physiology of habits. From our understanding: of the 
nervous system it is easy to see that a habit consists in a 
set of synapses so definitely established that under a given 
stimulus a perfectly certain and definite muscular response 
will take place. The synaptic pathway is established by do- 
ing with effort just the thing we wish to do by habit, and by 
repeating the doing of it until the successive performances, 
each leaving an increased strength in the synapses involved, 
have formed a neural pathway so strong that it is reasonably 
certain to function just as intended without effort to direct. 
Habits and machines. A habit is quite like a machine in 
that it is the most economical and reliable means of doing a 
perfectly definite thing in precisely the same way a great 
many times. Whenever there is sufficient demand to justify 
its installation, a good machine will produce its precise 
single sort of product with a rapidity, ease, and accuracy far 
beyond the possibility of piece production. The machine 
utilizes the cheaper and more reliable forms of power and 
enables the intelligence of one worker to accomplish what 
perhaps ten or a hundred were required to accomplish by the 
slow, laborious methods of hand production. The tremen- 
dous capacity of modern industry is due to this accuracy and
-P-A-G-E-57
  
  SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 47 
economy of machine production. So a useful and well- 
established habit accomplishes its special task with a cer- 
tainty, speed, and definiteness which is impossible in any 
process which must be directed at every step by attentive 
thought. Then, too, it utilizes mere muscular power, leaving 
the thought processes and attention free to direct other mat- 
ters at the same time. When the bicycling, piano-playing, 
typewriting, or other much-used sorts of activities get to the 
point where they “do themselves” with mechanical ease and 
accuracy, one’s mind is free to busy itself with other matters 
while these go on automatically ; one can enjoy the scenery 
and converse on quite foreign topics while he pedals his 
wheel or guides his automobile more safely than if he were 
thinking only of what his hands and feet are doing, or he 
may give his attention to the thoughts and feelings he would 
express in music or writing instead of forgetting these in the 
fingering of his keys or pen. 
Habits invaluable. The value of our equipment of habits 
is often not appreciated because they serve us so perfectly 
and unobtrusively that we are ordinarily no more conscious 
of them than we are of the operations of a right-functioning 
heart or stomach. Habits may become so completely a part 
of our organism that we are not aware of their existence. If 
we should imagine our helplessness without some of these, or 
if we were deprived of them through some unhappy paralysis, 
we should become keenly conscious of the vital part they 
play in our life economies. If we had to learn to walk anew 
every time we have to go about, if all our attention had to be 
. focused on the lacing of our shoes and the buttoning of our 
garments as when we first attempted them, if we had to 
handle knife and fork each time with the concentration and 
effort required when they were new to us, if every thought 
had to be expressed with the laborious struggle involved in 
using an unfamiliar language, it requires little imagination to
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
realize that we should not get far in an ordinary day’s work. 
Every simplest act would involve the strain and tedium of 
a child expressing his thoughts in his first written letter. 
Extravagance of useless habits. But.a machine is an ex- 
pensive and difficult thing to install and would be most ex- 
travagant to employ for products which are not to be used 
in large numbers. So the establishing of a reliable habit 
which will insure one’s doing a given thing with the least 
thought and effort and with the greatest rapidity and accu- 
racy is a most expensive educational process. It involves more 
expenditure of learning effort than the learning of the same 
thing on any other plane. Therefore it is of primary impor- 
tance that care should be taken in determining which activi- 
ties should be made habitual. Do not install a machine to do 
what you will seldom have occasion to do. It is tremen- 
dously wasteful. Yet this is precisely what a student is 
doing who laboriously “learns by heart” a lesson which he 
can never use again in that form except in the recitation fol- 
lowing. There may be some elements in any lesson which 
will be constantly needed to serve in an automatic way there- 
after, but it is certain that an overwhelmingly large part of 
what we get from books has no such value. 
Waste through imperfect habits. It must be equally evi- 
dent that a machine which does its work incorrectly is more 
certain to waste its materials and to produce unsatisfactory 
results than if the same work were to be done by hand. The 
more easily and frequently it operates, the greater its waste. 
The machine has no choice as to its product and no discre- 
tion as to the value of it. It simply does what it is formed to 
do, good, bad, or indifferent. Adjusted to turn out a bad 
product it will be absolutely sure never to turn out a good 
one. You cannot improve its product by speeding it up nor 
by working it-longer hours. Yet many a child is seeking to 
improve his penmanship simply by writing more, or his abil-
-P-A-G-E-59
SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 49 
ity to study simply by studying more, or his spelling ability 
by spelling more. Repetition secures ease and rapidity in 
doing exactly the thing which is repeated and in nothing 
else, certainly in nothing better. If a written character is 
poorly formed, the more often it is so formed the more cer- 
tain that it will continue to be poorly formed, and the more 
difficult it will be ever to correct the form of it. If composi- 
,tion work is carelessly prepared, the more often it is done 
the more improbable that it will ever be done differently. 
In the nervous system it is by the very doing of a thing that 
the synaptic machinery for doing it is formed; the way in 
which it is done determines the quality of the habit. 
Does practice make perfect? “Practice makes perfect” 
—only if the practice is perfect. Just as truly it has been 
said, “Practice makes imperfect”—if the practice is of that 
sort. Practice merely fixes its own character. Let us revise 
the old saw to read Only perfect practice makes perfect. 
How to form right habits. When it has been decided to 
construct a machine, much thought must be given to experi- 
menting, adjusting, correcting, readjusting, improving, until 
exactly the correct product is attained, and the simplest, 
surest way of getting it with the least cost and waste. Then 
constant watchfulness is necessary until it is certain that the 
machine is so adjusted that it will continue to perform pre- 
cisely and without variation. Not until then can it be trusted 
to be self-acting without further adjustment. Habit machines 
are no different from other machines in these particulars. So 
long as a thing needs to be learned, it is by that fact incapable 
of being done correctly without careful attention. Merely to 
repeat the imperfectly learned process is to fix it at its present 
stage of imperfection. What is necessary is that at each repe- __ 
tition the effort be carefully studied and compared with the 
ideal, its imperfections noted, and the next effort devoted to 
correcting them. Each repetition is a determined effort con-
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
sciously directed toward more nearly attaining the ideal. 
One correct performance cannot be expected to outweigh 
the influence of the many incorrect ones leading up to it, so 
that further continued attention is needed after perfection 
is mastered to make sure that there is no backsliding. Such 
will be the history of the attainment of any difficult bit of 
skill. Happily most of our learning is much simpler. 
Whether a single repetition be needed, as in spelling a simple 
word, or many thousands, as in pitching a curved ball with 
accuracy, the fundamental law laid down in the nervous 
structure is the same—attentive and corrective effort toward 
the ideal at each repetition alone can insure correct habit 
formation. One need have no fear of continuing the atten- 
tion and correction too long, for it is an inevitable condition 
of our make-up that when attention brings no changes it 
wanders to other things and the process quickly becomes 
automatic. In other words, if attention is accomplishing 
nothing it will not stay. 
Primitive learning. Mere repetition is the most primitive 
sort of learning. Where intelligence plays no part at all, 
some chance or necessity starts the process, each act influ- 
ences the next one to follow its own model, and this blind 
repetition fixes permanently that chance form. If the process 
happens to be a good one, the creature profits thereby ; if it 
prove injurious, the creature is ultimately destroyed by the 
very fact of the irresistible tendency to continue in the ruin- 
ous practice. This is simply the story of the “survival of the 
fittest,” the law of evolution. Development goes on more or 
less blindly without foresight of its trend. If the develop- 
ment chance to be a fortunate one, success and survival at- 
tend the individual and its race; if it chance to be harmful, 
the species is exposed to its enemies or is helpless to over- 
come its prey and ceases to exist. Only the pleasure which 
may attend the satisfaction of its needs or the pain which
-P-A-G-E-61
  SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 51 
may accompany its injury affords any guidance for the un- 
thinking creature to direct it toward its welfare rather than 
to its destruction. 
Unguided learning is primitive. A child set to the task 
of learning, without guidance as to how that learning is to 
be done, will inevitably follow the primitive, natural way of 
mere repetition. In the abstract sort of learning required for 
school lessons it is seldom that the pleasure-pain index of the 
success or failure of his efforts will be sufficiently definite to 
correct his procedure. Quite commonly he is wholly inca- 
pable of knowing whether he is making any progress. At best 
he can only know that he is or is not succeeding in the 
mechanizing process which he is attempting. Whether it 
should be mechanized at all, or to what extent, is entirely 
beyond his knowledge. However persistently and conscien- 
tiously he may apply himself to the task, he cannot be ex- 
pected to have foresight of the future uses of the material 
he is working on or to be able to analyze it into the elements 
which should be made automatic and those which should 
not. Nor can he without guidance know when his repe- 
titions are constantly approaching the ideal and when they 
are merely fixing in habit the errors with which he first 
approached the learning task. As the pupil matures and 
assumes more and more the direction of his own learning 
processes, it is this analysis and guidance of his learning 
efforts that he must ever keep before his mind. He must 
know that effective learning is not by means of sheer persist- 
ence in stupid repetition, but by increasing the intelligence 
of his efforts. 
Selective drill. The particular name applied to this learn- 
ing by repetition with the aim of forining habits is drill. It 
is important to notice not only the particular things which 
should be mastered by drill but also the particular parts of 
them upon which drill is necessary for that mastery. Most
-P-A-G-E-62
    52 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
habits are rather complex and involve some elements which 
are difficult to acquire along with others which are quite 
easy. Great economy results from intelligent analysis and 
concentration of one’s effort upon the points of difficulty. 
Some familiar examples may be drawn from our primary- 
school experiences. In learning multiplication there were a 
few combinations—mainly of sevens and  zeros—which 
caused probably nine tenths of all the blunders we made. 
It would have been a small matter, if we had been so guided, 
to have detected these troublesome points and, by concen- 
trating our drill upon them, to have perfected the whole 
process. Some of us, however, were so unfortunate as to 
spend our energies on trying to learn to multiply correctly 
by drilling on multiplication in general or by continuing to 
“go over” the tables in general. The result was that so much 
time was expended in continuing to “ learn” the combinations 
we already knew perfectly that we continued to get wrong 
those which we missed in spite of much discouraging drudg- 
ery. In spelling there were a few “demon” words so con- 
stantly recurring and so commonly misspelled as to give one 
the hopeless feeling of being a “naturally poor speller.” 
Some of these were which, there and their, whether, written, 
grammar, and separate. Possibly some of us are yet pursued 
by these unconquered demons. In each there are not more 
than one or two letters which could possibly give us trouble. 
In some it is the problem of doubling a consonant, in others an 
elusive unaccented vowel. By focusing drill intensely on one 
difficult word at a time, and strictly upon the danger point 
in that, good spelling becomes a habit in a surprisingly short 
time. In learning a foreign language there are a few idio- 
matic expressions, a few adverbs and particles, which cause 
a very large proportion of our difficulty. To spread the drill 
evenly over all parts of the vocabulary invariably means that 
an enormous amount of energy is wasted on elements already
-P-A-G-E-63
  SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 53 
known or on those too little used to justify drill, while the 
real keys eC mastery escape us. To “go over every word of 
the lesson ten times” means that a great deal of work will 
be done which is not worth doing, much will continue to be 
done which is already done, and usually the thing that 
most needs to be done remains undone. It is quite probable, 
too, that in this blind way one may be expending his energy 
in drilling in the very errors that he is supposed to be 
drilling out. 
Habits in and out of their setting. An important part of 
every habit is the connection in which it is to serve. It may 
be possible to practice a good swimming-stroke on the floor, 
but it is useless unless it will serve automatically in the 
water. Penmanship which is good in a copy book but care- 
less or illegible elsewhere is not good penmanship. A word 
learned correctly in a spelling-class but misspelled elsewhere 
is not learned. It is hardly worth while to use correct English 
forms in the grammar class if they are not used out of it. 
Classes exist only that the things learned in them may be 
used out of them. Not only should the habits supposed to be 
formed during one’s study be applied afterward, but much 
waste in learning will be avoided if that which is learned is 
learned in the connections in which it is to be used. The 
synapses formed by learning a word in a spelling-list or in 
spelling it orally are probably quite different from those re- 
quired to spell it automatically with a pen. There may be 
some value in learning the declensions and conjugations of 
a foreign language, but the associations thus formed have 
very little in common with connecting the mode, tense, 
number, and person ideas with the forms which represent 
them in reading or speaking the language. To be useful the 
associations must be learned in the sort of connections in 
which they are to be used. Why should amant be learned 
in connection with amo, amas, amat, amamus, amatis, when
-P-A-G-E-64
greene eT PSN ee Te TE eee Ree er HeReM TN RENTER oy PALA oe eee 
54 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
it never means these nor is ever used in association with 
these except in a grammar class? Why should “six times 
seven are forty-two” be learned in association with the 
“table of sixes,” since it can never be used in that connection 
except in recitation and since the knowledge of it as it is in 
the table does not by any means insure a knowledge of it as 
it is practically needed? Some values there may be in form- 
ing lists of dates, rulers, capitals, etc., for comparison, but 
only those things should be reduced to habit which are to be 
frequently used and then only in the sort of connection in 
which they are to be used. Students even go to such absurd 
lengths of study waste as to “learn by heart” (that is, reduce 
to automatic habit) the very words of a history, a geometry, 
or other lesson. They are setting up at cost of great effort 
habit-machines to do a thing that will never have to be done 
but once, if at all, and by so doing they inevitably miss the 
| real educative benefits to be attained from the lesson. 
Overdrilling and thoroughness. There is danger also of 
much waste of energy and often of actual retardation of the 
learning by means of overdrilling. A false idea of “thorough- 
ness” is commonly responsible for this fault. It is much as 
though one should seek to build up a sound physique by 
developing one muscle at a time. Suppose he should attempt 
to develop the right biceps to full size and strength before 
beginning on the left biceps, and only when this, in turn, is 
“completed,” he should start on some other muscle or organ. 
This is scarcely more absurd than the effort to “complete” 
nouns before “taking up” verbs, to “finish” equations be- 
fore “leaving” them, to get one lesson “perfectly” before 
starting the next. Nature has not provided us with that 
sort of an organism in either the nervous system or the 
muscular system. A biceps can be developed thoroughly 
only along with and in coédrdination with other muscles and 
organs. After undue exercise the biceps “goes stale” and  
-P-A-G-E-65
  
  SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 55 
must have rest while some other exercise is going on. So in 
any physical or mental drill, thoroughness does not consist 
in learning the one thing to completion before taking up the 
next, but in continuing the one so long as satisfactory prog- 
ress continues; then passing on to the next related task 
which applies and tests the former; then, as defects in the 
former are discovered, correcting them and drilling on them, 
returning again and again to strengthen the weak points 
until perfection is attained. Thoroughness is not in doing a 
task of habit formation all at once, but in never -abandon- 
ing the task until it is done. One must never forget that 
habit-forming is a growing process. Nerve tissues must be 
built up, and this takes time. It goes on as truly in the 
period of rest after exercise as during the exercise itself. 
When the nerves have built up and restored themselves after 
one period of drilling they are ready to profit by further 
drilling. Then, too, the learning connections are formed as 
truly by the use of them in the work that involves them as 
by the separated drill. Many skills can be acquired only in 
the connections in which they are practically used, others 
need to be taken out of their setting for special drill and then 
relearned in their true association, but any of them are fully 
and thoroughly learned only when they function easily just 
as they are to be used. 
Rate of learning. Progress in the learning of any special 
skill does not often go on at a uniform rate. After a period 
of encouraging success there will usually be an “off day,” 
perhaps several of them. Not only is there little or no appar- 
ent increase of ability, but there may be an actual decrease. 
This fact stands out clearly in practically all “curves” or 
graphs showing the rate of improvement in typewriting, tele- 
graphing, the tossing of balls, and other carefully measured 
results of drilling. It is not certain whether these “plateaus,” 
or periods of retardation in growth, are due to defects in the  
-P-A-G-E-66
56 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
method of learning or to necessary reorganizations in the 
nerve system. It may be that an ideal training could avoid 
them entirely, or it may be that they are like the temporary 
interruption of traffic while improvements are being made 
in the roadway. In any case they are to be expected. There 
is no occasion for discouragement or for slackening of effort 
when these times of no apparent progress occur. Only over- 
drilling and excessive fatigue are to be avoided. The next 
spurt of improvement may come very suddenly and unex- 
pectedly, and it is likely to be particularly rapid after an 
unusual period of retardation. Besides faithful practice the 
only things needful are careful analysis of the process and 
more intelligence in adjusting and improving the mode of 
learning. 
Habit-breaking. We have been discussing those habits 
which are difficult to acquire, which require effort and in- 
telligence to form effectively. Our natural habit-forming 
tendency, however, causes us to form countless habits unin- 
tentionally and even unconsciously. Many of these are abso- 
lutely necessary to our welfare, but all of us know only too 
well that many habits get themselves fastened upon us which 
it is quite essential to our welfare that we break away from. 
If good habits are a priceless equipment for success and 
happiness, bad habits are an equally certain means of unhap- 
piness and failure. Bad habits are relentless enemies har- 
bored within us. It would seem to be common sense at least 
to insist that the habits we keep should be our friends. We 
have seen in an earlier chapter that there is no direct way 
of disconnecting neural pathways already formed. There is 
no way of uwnforming habits by direct effort and attention. 
It can be done only by letting them disintegrate through 
disuse. This is the sort of thing which cannot be speeded up 
or hurried. Watchfulness and persistency, not hurry or in- 
tensity, are the means of getting rid of habits. We may  
-P-A-G-E-67
  SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 57 
sometimes long for an operation or an amputation which 
would, however violently, get rid of them once for all. But 
this is no more possible than getting into the brain to make 
the connections we desire. We make a habit only by re- 
peatedly doing the thing that the habit is to do; we break it 
only by never doing the thing it does. Once a neural pathway 
is well formed an occasional repetition of the act involved at 
long intervals is sufficient to keep it in full force and vigor. 
If we seek to destroy it, these occasional repetitions, at how- 
ever long intervals, must not occur. As James forcibly ex- 
pressed the situation: 
The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in Jefferson’s play, excuses himself 
for every fresh dereliction by saying, ‘I won’t count this time!” 
Well! He may not count it, and a kind Heaven may not count it ; 
but it is being counted none the less. Down among his nerve-cells 
and fibers the molecules are counting it, registering it, and storing it 
up to be used against him when the next temptation comes. 
The fact that one repetition after a long period of inactivity 
is sufficient to restore the efficiency of a habit is most en- 
couraging when we are seeking to retain habits of value to 
us. It seems most discouraging when we long to rid ourselves 
forever of those which have enshackled us. It emphasizes 
what we have said about nature’s laws and those of the 
nervous system being entirely neutral morally. They do not 
necessarily make for either good or bad. They are merely 
facts which we may use either for or against ourselves. In- 
telligence is given us that we may learn these laws, just as 
we may learn the laws of any other science, and make sure 
that we use them only for our good. The simple, cold fact 
is that if we would break a harmful habit we must cease at 
once to permit it to function and never permit an exception. 
If we find that at any time we have slipped, there is nothing 
to be gained by blaming fate or luck or an unkind provi- 
dence,—they have nothing to do with it,—but get another

grip and hold on all the tighter. One other important thing 
we can do to loose the grip of habit. Get busy at something 
else. As we shall see in subsequent chapters, the idea of an 
act tends to produce it. Therefore, do not think of the thing 
you desire not to do. Think of the thing that ought to be 
done, and do it. When temptation is strong to do the thing 
we have resolved to quit, we must concentrate our energies 
upon the things we have resolved to do. 
The choice of habits. Successful learning, then, in the field 
of habit formation consists first of all in a wise selection of 
the habits which are formed. The student owes it to him- 
self to see that all his habits are his friends. He should early 
form the basic habit of determining for himself what habits 
shall count in his life and character instead of having them 
selected by mere chance. In his study he should decide in- 
telligently which portions of his assigned lessons are of a sort 
that should be made mechanical and which are not. Because 
it is wise or necessary to know a thing is no reason for form- 
ing it into a habit. It is wise to mechanize only those acts 
which are to be much used, and even these only in the form 
and in the connections in which they are to be used. The 
inventory of one’s habits should show first of all those which 
make for health and vigor. He should cultivate healthful as 
well as graceful habits of posture in sitting, standing, and 
walking; deep breathing; thorough chewing of his food; 
cleanliness of hands, teeth, and body, inside and out ; regular 
hours of work and of rest ; promptness in rising and in every 
duty; energetic intensity in work and in play. Such things 
are invaluable in life and are needed constantly at all times 
of life. They may be very difficult to do unless made 
‘habitual, but they are entirely easy and go on perfectly with- 
out effort or attention once they become automatic. Then 
there is a vast number of special movements whose accuracy 
and ease make the difference between success and failure,
-P-A-G-E-69
SETTING UP THE MACHINERY—HABIT 59 
between ease and awkwardness, between certainty and un- 
certainty in all our work and play—whether it be milking 
a cow, sweeping a floor, throwing a ball, playing a piano, 
or wielding a pen. There is usually one best way of doing 
each, and that should be made habitual. The skillful use of 
every tool implies a series of muscular habits in its manipu- 
lation—a knife or a fork, the tool of a carpenter or machinist 
or dentist or surgeon or soldier. This muscular skill is one 
measure of success in every trade. Very important to every 
student are correct language habits, the right pronunciation 
and spelling of words commonly used. It is disgraceful that 
one should have the slightest hesitation about the spelling of 
words in constant use—more so than that one should be igno- 
rant of thousands of words seldom used, which might well be 
looked up on occasion if needed. The same is true of the 
fundamental operations in arithmetic—the use of the deci- 
mal point, common calculations of interest and discount, the 
basic processes of algebra, and a few constantly used formu- 
las of the sciences. Beyond these and others already sug- 
gested in this chapter, there are few things in ordinary book 
study which need to be mechanized. Always it is the ques- 
tion of the extent to which a thing is to be used and the 
connection in which it is to be used that should guide a 
student in the selection of the habits he is to form.

  CHAPTER V 
HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD— SENSATION 
Function of the tactual sense. It would be useless for any 
creature to move unless it had some means of knowing when 
and where to move. An equipment of nerve and muscle 
to produce motion would more certainly contribute to de- 
struction than to safety if there were nothing but chance to 
indicate the occasion or direction of the motion. The lowest 
forms of life having any capacity for movement have some 
degree of sensitivity which makes them aware of objects 
with which they are in actual contact. Even plants which 
have the power to protect themselves by closing their leaves 
and flowers which trap insects for their food do so only 
in response to the actual touch of the enemy or prey with 
which they are concerned. The simplest one-celled ani- 
mals, like the amceba, are provided with some such sensi- 
tiveness to heat, cold, light, solid objects, etc., and with 
some means of responding to these stimulations. These re- 
actions ordinarily serve to protect the creature from danger 
and enable it to pursue and seize its food. Being entirely 
automatic, however, such responses may under changed con- 
ditions become destructive.» For example, the paramecium, 
—an interesting, minute one-celled animal,—however stimu- 
lated, invariably moves in a predetermined direction, though 
by so doing it may move directly into destruction. Every 
portion of the surface of the human body is normally sensi- 
tive to any actual contact. As the need for protection against 
the entrance of foreign substances, insects, etc. is greater 
about the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, we find the sensi- 
62
-P-A-G-E-73
  
HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 63 
tiveness to touch is greater at these points. Since the hands 
must be so largely used in feeling and manipulating things, 
the sense of touch is particularly keen in the finger tips. The 
~ trunk of an elephant, the antennz of insects, and the whis- 
kers of cats are likewise organs of peculiar sensitivity to 
touch. ; 
Its varied forms. It is probable that in the lowest forms 
of sensitive life, those having no organized or specialized 
nerve system and but a single unvarying form of response, 
all contacts are undifferentiated except that they are either 
soothing or irritating; either they make the creature content 
with its situation or they stimulate it to action which will 
change that situation. Creatures which have a choice of 
more than one sort of response must have some discrimina- 
tion among the kinds of contact in order to guide that 
response. In man mere tactual contact affords four quite 
distinct sorts of experience. Besides the simple sense of 
touch there are those of warmth, cold, and pain. This is 
evidenced not only by the analysis of our experiences, such 
as any of us can make very readily, but is indicated by the 
arrangement of the nerve endings themselves. Throughout 
the skin there are embedded millions of nerve ends, but all 
are of just four different sorts. Their arrangement might be 
compared to an elaborate pattern of threads of four colors in 
a Wilton or velvet rug. If we could think of the rug respond- 
ing only in its red threads to one sort of wear or treatment, in 
its blue threads to another sort, and, similarly, the green and 
the yellow to other treatments, we get some notion of the 
manner in which the skin feels the four different sorts of 
touch on the same surface. Normally one sort of these nerve 
endings responds only to cold, another sort only to warmth, 
another gives us only the sensation of touch, while the others 
always give us only pain. If the endings for cold are stimu- 
lated by an electric or chemical stimulus, they respond by
-P-A-G-E-74
64 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
giving a sensation of cold. Likewise the other three respond 
to any stimulation which can affect them at all, always with 
their own appropriate sensation of warmth, touch, or pain. 
Any given point on the skin, therefore, is sensitive to only one 
of these four sorts of contact according to which sort of nerve 
ending underlies it; just as each point on the rug has just 
one color according to the thread at that point. Under suit- 
able conditions and with proper care the individual cold and 
warm spots on any area of the skin may be found and 
marked. As there are some dozens of each in a square inch 
of surface on most portions of the body, we feel tempera- 
ture through many at once, and seem to feel it by areas 
rather than by spots. Endings which respond to touch, or 
pressure, are found at the base of each of the countless, tiny 
hairs which cover the surface of the body, making each hair 
serve as a projecting organ of touch. The endings which 
give the sensation of pain are so situated as to be affected 
only by the more extreme conditions of pressure, heat, cold, 
or other disturbance. One wonders how, by means of only 
these four sorts of sensitiveness in the skin, we can readily 
distinguish the distinctive feel of so many different sorts of 
contacts and surfaces. How can we distinguish wet, dry, 
slimy, fuzzy, furry, hard, soft, rough, smooth, silky, velvety, 
etc.? Manifestly these must be known through combina- 
tions of the four. A hard surface presses with an even and 
positive resistance, while a soft surface “gives”; a smooth 
surface presses evenly, and a rough one unevenly; a wet 
surface gives some characteristic slippery or sticky resist- 
ance. Sight, sound, and odor aid us in distinguishing some 
surfaces, while to get the feel of others it is necessary to 
pass the fingers back and forth over them and hence multi- 
ply the touch experiences we get from them. 
Anesthesia. Abnormal conditions of the nervous system 
sometimes bring about more or less insensitivity of portions 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
Ce ee eCa My re ek et eam 
HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 65 
of the skin. This condition is called anesthesia, a kind of 
sensory paralysis. In olden times such anesthetic spots were 
believed to be the brand of the devil. Women suspected of 
being witches were burned on the sole evidence of the pres- 
ence of these areas of insensitivity. In modern times they 
are understood to be evidence of some nervous disorder. 
They commonly accompany a more or less hysterical con- 
dition. Among the most humane discoveries of modern 
medical science are the means of producing insensitivity to 
pain, either local or general, in order to avoid suffering dur- 
ing surgical operations. The drugs used for this purpose are 
called anesthetics. 
Educability. The sense of touch is capable of a very high 
degree of development. Unusual keenness in this sense is of 
much practical value in enabling its possessor to discrimi- 
nate the texture of cloth, paper, and other textiles, spurious 
money, and the like, and as a guide to manipulation of fine 
instruments such as are used by surgeons and engravers. 
Blind persons often develop a sense of touch so marvelously 
delicate as to take the place of sight to a large extent. That 
a refined and delicate sense of touch is a source of much 
pleasure is evidenced by the satisfaction found in garments 
of silk and other goods of fine texture. The refinement of 
touch is a matter of practice with attentive discrimination 
of the sort it is desired to develop. 
Taste. An arrangement of nerve endings on the tongue 
somewhat similar to that we have found in the skin gives 
rise in similar manner to four kinds of taste : sweet, sour, salt, 
and bitter. The importance of this sense and of its particular 
location as a means of distinguishing the wholesome and 
the unwholesome in our food and drink is very apparent. 
Primitive taste is a useful guide to safety in the selection 
of primitive foods, but in our complex living, with its count- 
less artificial ways of preparing what we eat and drink, it 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  66 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
is necessary to depend on judgment to supplement nature’s 
guidance. Intelligence has discovered long since that not all 
pleasant-tasting things are wholesome, and very disagreeable 
ones are sometimes prescribed by the doctors as absolutely 
necessary. Then, too, agreeableness of taste is largely a 
matter of habit, and tastes of almost any sort may be culti- 
vated at will. In civilization, intelligence must not only 
serve as a guide to the selection of foods but must also serve 
as a guide to the development of the tastes. That the satis- 
faction of one’s sense of taste contributes very largely to the 
pleasure of life is realized even by the infant who cries for 
candy. Supplying the things which will cater to the desire for 
pleasant tastes ranks among the world’s chief industries and 
among the principal occupations of the home. Because one’s 
taste is easily perverted and may thus become a source of 
danger or discontent, it should be trained to like the things 
it ought to like and thus make its usefulness and its pleas- 
ures coincide rather than conflict. Professional chefs and 
tea-tasters are evidence of the remarkable refinement of 
discrimination which is possible to those who make a busi- 
ness of developing the sense of taste. The development of 
one’s taste both as to the fineness of discrimination and as to 
the degree of pleasure it may afford is, like the development 
of habit, a matter of practice with constant attention. It is 
not a gift but an achievement. 
Smell. We ordinarily think of ourselves as distinguishing 
not merely four tastes but countless different flavors. These, 
however, are afforded us by just four tastes combined with 
a great variety of odors. The nose being placed immediately 
over the mouth and connected with it by inner passages as 
well, it is ordinarily impossible for us to distinguish between 
the two senses. Things which have always been experienced 
together are usually thought of as one until some unusual 
situation enables us to experience the one without the other.
-P-A-G-E-77
  
HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 67 
When one’s nasal passages are clogged with mucus, as when 
one has “a bad cold in the head,” the ability to taste is lim- 
ited to the four true sensations of the tongue. Experiment of 
various kinds easily demonstrates the same facts. Our dis- 
cussion in the preceding paragraph had reference to this 
combination sense rather than to taste proper, because nor- 
mally it is only thus that we taste. The organ of smell is 
located in a portion of the lining of the nose situated at the 
top of the arch of the nostrils, just where the inhaled currents 
of air must pass over it. Its construction is not so well under- 
stood as that of the senses already described, but it is doubt- 
less similar in general principle. It is affected by gaseous 
substances only, while the “taste buds,” or nerve endings 
in the tongue, are sensitive only to substances in the form 
of liquids or which become liquid by solution in the fluids 
of the mouth. Attempts to enumerate or classify the vari- 
ous odors to which we are sensitive, or to find any direct re- 
lation between different odors and the parts of the olfactory 
organ itself, have not thus far been very successful. Whether 
there are a few basic odors, and the others are combinations 
of these, or whether there is a great number of: distinct types 
of olfactory stimuli and hence of nerve endings in the organ, 
is still unknown. This sense, aside from its immense practi- 
cal value, is likewise the means of affording a great deal of 
pleasure. For its gratification we produce many flowers and 
perfumes, and, as we have seen, it enters very largely into all 
the pleasures of taste. Like other senses, it is susceptible of 
a very high degree of refinement by practice in attentive dis- 
crimination, and the more it is developed the more of use- 
fulness and pleasure it can contribute to life. 
Fatigue and overstimulation. Both taste and smell read- 
ily become “fatigued” or “adapted”; that is, if continu- 
ously subjected to a given stimulus they will come in time 
to ignore it and to be no longer sensitive to it. This is why 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
one confined to the impure atmosphere of a “close” room 
presently ceases to notice the odor, which was at first very 
offensive. The value of this provision is in the fact that 
“what can’t be cured must be endured,” and one’s attention 
may be devoted to other matters. The danger in it, however, 
is in such well-known facts as that one may be fatally 
poisoned by the gradual increase of an injurious gas in the 
atmosphere without his even becoming conscious of the odor. 
Overstimulation of either sense tends to destroy its delicate 
sensitivity. Thus it is that the continued use of highly 
seasoned foods, alcoholic drinks, and the like, decrease one’s 
ability to enjoy delicately flavored foods and drinks and 
make necessary a continually increasing intensity of flavor- 
ing and seasoning to produce the former taste satisfaction. 
Such a jaded taste fails to perform its natural functions of 
protecting the stomach from injurious foods or of giving the 
pleasure which is natural in the eating of plain foods. A 
truly refined taste finds far more satisfaction in the simple 
and wholesome foods than the overstimulated sense can find 
in the most highly seasoned. and indigestible foods. 
Vision. Much the larger part of our knowledge of the 
world about us and the richest pleasures of the sense life 
come to us, not from the objects and substances with which 
we come into actual contact through the skin, tongue, or 
nose but from objects which are inches or miles away from 
us and which we know by means of the sound or light waves 
that arouse sensations through our ears and eyes. Light 
waves are vibrations in a substance called ether, which fills 
all space wherever light can shine, even to the uttermost 
stars, and which is so fine and impalpable that it cannot be 
seen nor felt nor known in any other way except by its light- 
bearing vibrations. These vibrations are rather rapid; the 
blue rays, for example, vibrating at the rate of some six 
hundred millions of millions of waves per second. Other
-P-A-G-E-79
  HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 69 
rates give other colors. It is to receive these unthinkably 
rapid waves of this inconceivably unsubstantial substance, 
and to analyze and organize them into ideas of the objects 
which reflect them to us, that we are provided with eyes. It 
is staggering to attempt to think of the number, frequency, 
and rate of travel of the light waves which strike upon one’s 
retina while looking for a moment at an apple, a picture, or 
a theatrical show. Yet it is just these vibrations or waves of 
ether that we do sift, arrange, organize, and interpret into all 
the things, persons, and movements we see. The power of 
the eyes to discriminate colors, shades, and tints, and by 
means of these arranged in infinite combinations to enable us 
to know objects, substances, persons, to understand their 
positions, movements, and relations, is marvelous beyond 
words. With the aid of optical instruments the reach of the 
eye extends to objects most distant and its power of dis- 
crimination to the most minute. 
The eye. Some of the lowest forms of organisms seem to be 
stimulated by light in precisely the way they are stimulated 
by heat, contact with foreign substances, or other disturb- 
ing stimuli. The meduse (jellyfish) have specialized pig- 
mented spots which are sensitive to light only but which 
can give them no power to distinguish objects. Animals 
somewhat higher in the scale have such spots underlying 
lenses which concentrate the light rays upon them. Com- 
parative physiology tells of many extremely interesting va- 
riations in the structure of the organs which are stimulated 
by light waves, and we can speculate upon the varying 
sensations to which they must give rise. But the human 
eye is a marvel of adaptability and efficiency even among the 
wonders of the human organism. As an optical instrument, 
its rapid and automatic adjustments and perfect adaptation 
to constantly varying demands are astonishing. Set deep in 
the protecting skull, covered by the lids when not in use,
-P-A-G-E-80
  70 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
automatically cleansed by the purifying salt fluid and wiped 
by the winking lids, provided with the keenest tactile nerves 
to warn us of the presence of an injurious object, it is ad- 
mirably guarded, considering that it must function always in 
a most exposed position. To secure the correct focus of the 
light upon the nerve endings in the retina, there are three 
distinct sets of automatically acting minute muscles: first, 
those which turn the eyes instantly to any point within the 
range of vision—and these must turn not merely each eye 
but both in perfect unison; second, those which keep the 
two eyes correctly converged together upon an object at 
varying distances ; and, third, those which automatically and 
instantly alter the convexity of the lens in order to focus 
the rays on the retina, whatever the distance of the object. 
By means of other tiny muscles the iris, or circular colored 
curtain, is automatically adjusted to regulate the amount of 
illumination which enters the organ, contracting in the pres- 
ence of strong light and opening when light is dim, like the 
shutter adjustment of a camera. The rather slow adjustment 
of the iris is readily observable when one passes from a dark 
to a brilliantly lighted room or the reverse. In the one case 
the eyes are dazzled by overstimulation before the iris closes 
sufficiently to shut out the excess light, while in the other 
case the aperture is too small at first to make vision in the 
dim light possible. 
The retina and color vision. The retina itself is an area of 
nerve endings lining the rear portion of the eyeball. The 
stimulation of these endings by the action of the light waves 
sets up the nerve currents which give rise to light sensation. 
The nerve endings are of two distinct forms, named, because 
of their shape, rods and cones. The rods respond to the 
varying degrees of brightness in the series from white to 
black. They are used in dim lights, where objects are dis- 
tinguished but colors are lacking. The cones arouse the sen-
-P-A-G-E-81
  HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 71 
sations of color. There are two pairs of these color processes : 
the red-green and the blue-yellow. Red sensation blends 
with blue, giving the purples; it blends with yellow, giving 
the shades of orange; but it neutralizes green. A reddish 
green would be merely less green, and a greenish red less 
red, each approaching a neutral gray. When the two colors 
are mixed on the retina, which is readily done by rotating 
them rapidly before the eyes on a color wheel or similar 
device, the result is the sensation of neutral gray; if, how- 
ever, they are contrasted with each other, placed side by 
side, they accent each other, and the red seems redder and 
the green greener. Precisely the same relation prevails be- 
tween blue and yellow. Black and white also neutralize 
each other in combination and strengthen each other in con- 
trast. These six colors in combination give all the shades, 
tints, and tones of color which can be distinguished by the 
eyes. They are known as the primary colors. Each of the 
pairs—red and green, blue and yellow, black and white—are 
complementary colors. A further interesting fact regarding 
the relation of complementary colors to each other is found 
in the after-sensations (commonly called after-images). If 
one looks for a minute or two in a good light at a clearly 
defined patch of pronounced color and then closes his eyes, 
or looks intently at an area of white or neutral gray, there 
will slowly develop a patch of the same shape but of the 
complementary color. If a strong primary color is brought 
into contrast with a neutral-toned background or overlay, 
the neutral-colored portion will take on a tinge of the com- 
plementary color; for example, a neutral gray patch laid on 
white appears much darker than if laid on black, laid on 
1These statements apply strictly to the mixing of lights or stimulations 
of the retina. Mixing blue and yellow pigments gives a substance .which 
sends only green rays to the retina, but that fact has no bearing on the 
sensation problem under discussion. :
-P-A-G-E-82
  We PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
green it appears pink, and laid on blue it appears yellowish. 
These contrasts and after-sensations are among the impor- 
tant facts which give rise to the theory that the retinal activ- 
ity is somewhat similar to the neutralizing effects of acids and 
bases upon each other. The central point of the retina is very 
highly developed and is called the fovea centralis. It is this 
portion which is used when looking directly at an object. 
The outer marginal areas consist of rods only and hence have 
no power to discriminate colors. Many simple and very in- 
teresting experiments are easily arranged to demonstrate the 
various statements in this paragraph regarding color vision. 
It may be added that from 3 to 5 per cent of men (very 
few women) are color blind; that is, are lacking in one or 
both pairs of color discrimination. 
Eyestrain. Although it is a matter of hygiene rather than 
of psychology, it is important to understand that modern 
life, particularly that of the student, has increased the de- 
mands upon this wonderful and delicate organ of vision 
more rapidly than the organ itself has developed to meet the 
demands. The eyes serve us so well that we do not realize the 
tremendous amount of activity involved in such a common 
process as reading a page of print. Each line of print read 
involves three to five jumps forward and one all the way 
back, and at each jump there must be a new alignment and 
distance adjustment of each eye and of the two to each 
other, both as to the placing of the ball and as to the con- 
vexity of the lens. There must be constant adjustment of the 
iris, with every slight variation of light intensity as reflected 
from the page or from the background. Nerve strain and 
defective vision are the penalties that more than 25 per cent 
of us are paying for needless overtaxing of our eyes. Most 
of this would be avoided if the following principles were 
faithfully observed. Never read or write in a dim light. 
Never allow light to shine directly into the eyes from a lamp

  Fic. 5. THE Eve 
This diagram shows a cross section of the right eyeball looked at from above. 
The ball consists of three coats. The first is the tough outer sclerotic, which 
at the front becomes the transparent cornea; the second is the black choroid, 
which absorbs excess light, like the lining of a camera, and at the front takes 
the form of the automatically adjusting curtain, the iris, and constitutes the 
colored ring about the pupil. The central opening is occupied by the lens, 
which focuses the light rays upon the innermost coat, or retina, which con- 
sists of the nerve endings and is the place where the light waves become 
transformed into nerve currents. Minute muscles (z) adjust the convexity 
(2) of the lens to varying distances of objects (3). The fovea is the center 
of highest sensitivity of the retina and receives the image of an object at 
which one is looking directly (3). The fibers from the retina pass out 
through the optic nerve, and light rays (4) falling upon this nerve are in- 
visible, causing a blind spot in each eye. The shape of the ball is maintained 
by the aqueous (5) and vitreous (6) fluids in the remaining spaces. Several 
sets of muscles are attached for moving the eyeball.

Fic. 6. A DiacramMatic SECTIONAL VIEW OF THE EAR 
Air waves are gathered by the external ear and directed through the canal 
against the tympanic membrane. The vibrations of the membrane set in 
motion the chain of three tiny bones (hammer, 1; anvil, 2; and stirrup, 3) 
which transmit the vibrations through the oval foramen to the fluid of the 
inner ear (cochlea). The vibrations in this fluid are in some manner re- 
ceived by the nerve endings in the spiral organ of Corti and pass thence as 
nerve currents by the auditory nerve to the auditory center in the brain, 
the stimulation of which gives rise to sensations of sound. Figure 4 in the 
diagram indicates one of the three semicircular canals which are the organ 
of equilibrium.

or window while working. The light from the book should 
be stronger than any from thé background. Avoid highly 
calendered paper which reflects streaks of varying light in- 
tensity. Avoid cross lights, especially in writing, or lights so 
placed that shadows from the hand are continuously playing 
over the paper. Avoid getting the work too near the eyes 
and thus increasing the strain of convergence and accommo- 
dation. Ease the eyes frequently by looking at objects far 
away and by closing them. Avoid small print. Avoid placing 
the book at an angle which produces foreshortening and dis- 
tortion of the apparent shape of the letters. Consult a reli- 
able oculist promptly whenever the eyes become painful or 
vision becomes blurred. 
Hearing. We have seen how the ether waves which are 
interpreted to the mind as light are of importance in the 
welfare of most sentient creatures. Air waves also, which 
contribute the sensation of sound, afford a wonderfully ef- 
fective means of detecting the presence of danger, of discov- 
ering prey, of communication, and in countless ways enter 
into the problems and pleasures of life. As organs for the re- 
ception of sound some lower forms of life(for example, Ccelen- 
terata) are provided with simple pits (otocysts) which are 
sensitive to sound-wave stimulations. Successively higher 
forms of animal life have developed more and more elaborate 
organs of hearing, of which the most complete is the very 
complex deep cavity embedded in the bony structure of the 
cranium and known as the ear. The physiology of the ear is 
as remarkable as that of the eye, and the study of it is as 
fascinating. Very briefly we may summarize the mechanical 
process thus: the outer ear gathers the sound waves and 
directs them against the tympanum, a membrane somewhat 
like a drumhead ; this communicates the vibration to a series 
of tiny bones (hammer, anvil, and stirrup) which in turn 
set up a vibration in the fluid which fills the spiral-shaped  
-P-A-G-E-86
  74 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
cavity of the inner ear; this in turn imparts the motion 
to a series of short bristles which project from the mem- 
brane (organ of Corti) in which lie the nerve endings. These 
bristles or hairs seem to “pick up” and sort out the vibra- 
tions in much the same manner that different strings of a 
musical instrument vibrate in unison with sound waves, 
some responding to waves of certain lengths only, and other 
strings to other lengths of waves. Thus the air waves are 
changed successively into movements of the tympanum, of 
the bones, of the fluid, and of the bristles in the inner ear 
before the nerves are reached and the whole becomes nerve 
current. All these are necessary preliminaries to the sen- 
sation of hearing. 
Its worth. Like the other senses, hearing may be trained 
to a very high degree of sensitivity and discrimination by 
attentive practice. The trained physician recognizes in- 
stantly an irregularity of heart action in his patient by the 
sound of the heart beat; the machinist detects a slight 
knocking amid the roar and rumbling of the factory; the 
woodsman hears the faint barking of a squirrel amid the 
countless noises of the forest; the telegrapher receives clear 
messages where the untrained listener hears but a monoto- 
nous clicking; and an accomplished musician recognizes the 
slightest discord amid the thunders of a great orchestra. 
Besides the enormous part that the sense of hearing plays 
in the practical affairs of life as a means of communication 
and of giving us information of the world in which we live, 
one of the puzzling facts of life is the remarkable influence 
which music has upon the emotions and conduct. Martial 
courage, political enthusiasm, religious exaltation, and the 
rhythmic joys of the dance are aroused by appropriate music. 
It soothes the weary and anxious and cheers the melancholic. 
It is the voice of love, of mourning, of joy or victory. It has 
“charms to soothe the savage breast” or to arouse to blind

  HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—S® 
frenzy. It plays an astonishingly large part in tt 
the savage as well as of the most cultivated. In its char 
teristic variations it expresses the innermost differences in 
national and racial traits. Individual character, too, is in 
large measure disclosed by the type of music that one loves, 
and the development of one’s character is influenced by the 
music that he learns to love. 
Sense refinement. In each of these senses we have dis- 
cussed, the primitive uncultured or overstimulated organ is 
incapable of discriminating or enjoying the finer differences 
of sensation. Savages are pleased with only the strongest 
sweets and coarse flavors, with rank scents and smells, with 
brilliant colors and loud, noisy music. Ragtime and jazz, 
flashy jewelry, gaudy clothing and showy ornamentation, 
strong perfumes and crude flavors, are the joys of the uncul- 
tured tastes and are accompanied by an inability to find en- 
joyment in delicate flavors and perfumes and the soft 
harmonies of color and tone. Masterpieces of painting and 
of music are not such because of the amount of color or of 
noise involved but because of the thought and feeling ex- 
pressed by the subtle strokes and harmonies. Life is lifted 
to a higher plane and its lasting joys incalculably enhanced 
by training in refined discrimination and appreciation of the 
finest things in art and music. 
Equilibrium. Relatively little is known of the “static 
sense,” or sense of equilibrium, which informs us of the posi- 
tion of the body and gives the “sense of direction.” The 
organ is located in the bony structure of the cranium and is 
connected with the inner ear. It consists of three semicir- 
cular canals set at right angles to each other, in plan and in 
function quite like a carpenter’s spirit-level. Dizziness and 
seasickness are doubtless due to the overstimulation of this 
organ. The superior ability of some persons to keep their 
sense of direction, to scale lofty heights without dizziness,

or this kinesthetic sense are the simple nerve 
S the tendons and joints and possibly in the 
musv. Experiment has shown that this sense, too, is 
educable, and by attentive practice one’s power of discrimi- 
nation in weights is increased. 
Organic sensations. Under this name are included an 
undetermined number of sensations having their location in 
the internal organs. Among them may be mentioned hunger, 
thirst, faintness, vigor, headache, and countless others. 
Doubtless some of these may be analyzed into variations or 
combinations of the special senses already described. These 
are of physiological rather than psychological importance. 
All probably serve some bodily need, usually in advising us 
of the wholesome or unwholesome conditions of the body. 
Are there yet other senses? We see that the old notion of 
the “five senses”—seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and 
feeling—is quite incomplete. How much farther the analysis 
may be carried in the future is an interesting problem. 
There is yet much of the nervous system not fully under- 
stood, and not all of human experience has been analyzed 
and explained. Certain animals have a keenness of sense 
far beyond any power of human beings; for example, the 
scent of the bloodhound. Fish have an arrangement of nerve 
endings along the sides which may mean a kind of sense 
entirely unlike anything we know. Science, by means of 
various instruments, has detected many forms of energy and 
contact of which we are ordinarily wholly unaware. There 
are ether vibrations having length and frequency both above 
and below those which we can see as light; there are air     
-P-A-G-E-89
  
HOW WE KNOW THE WORLD—SENSATION 77 
waves both too rapid and too slow for us to hear; there are 
forms of radioactivity and of magnetic, chemical, and elec- 
tric energy which our senses cannot detect unless trans- 
formed by our instruments. There has been much discussion 
of telepathy, personal magnetism, spirit communications, 
and other mysterious forms of experience which are said to 
show there are means of communicating from mind to mind 
other than through the organs of sense. This is an interest- 
ing field for speculation, but claims of special knowledge or 
powers can hardly be admitted to a science of psychology 
until every student can share such experiences under condi- 
tions which can be described and controlled. 
Localization of functions. Another interesting fact we 
have already noted regarding the senses is that a definite 
area in the cortex of the cerebrum is connected with each. 
The optical nerves lead from the eyes to a very definite 
place at the back of the brain. An injury to this portion of 
the brain results in blindness. There are brain centers for 
smell and taste. The cutaneous sensations are arranged on a 
somewhat different plan. All the sensations from the left 
foot are located at a special point at the top of the right 
side of the brain; those from the left leg, side, arm, and hand 
appear in that order lower down on the right side; while 
those from the right side of the body are similarly arranged 
on the left side of the brain. Injuries to the brain usually 
result in some sort of paralysis, and by observing the nature 
of the paralysis a specialist can determine with exactness the 
location of the trouble in the brain. 
Summary. In concluding this chapter let us note that the 
foundation of intelligence, the basal means that nature has 
evolved for making her creatures aware of the world of peril 
and of opportunity which surrounds them, is the series of 
sense organs. Each of these consists of specialized and more  
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
or less highly developed endings of sensory nerves. Each is 
adapted to respond to a particular sort of stimulation such 
as commonly occurs in the physical world and is of impor- 
tance in the welfare of the creature. Each is connected with 
nerve pathways leading to some specialized center in the 
cortex. When these sensory centers of the brain are stimu- 
lated into action by the incoming currents, there occur the. 
mental experiences we know as sensations—sight, sound, 
smell, etc. In this chapter we have emphasized the training 
and refinement of the senses because of the practical impor- 
tance of such development. For the sake of scientific accu- 
racy, however, it should be understood that such refinement 
is as much a matter of improving associations in the cortex 
as of actual development of the sense organ or its sensory 
center in the brain. As will be seen in later chapters, one’s 
perception of fine differences of color or tone, one’s judgment 
of good or bad in music or art, one’s likes and dislikes in 
tastes and odors, involve far more of mental development 
than mere sensation differences.

CHAPTER VI 
COMBINING SENSE MATERIALS—PERCEPTION 
Simple sensations do not exist. Sensations alone can give 
us no knowledge of the world about us. A mere experience 
of redness or loudness or sourness, ceasing as soon as the 
stimulus is removed and signifying to us no more than the 
sensation itself, would leave us no wiser and no better able to 
‘deal with things which gave rise to them than if it had not 
occurred. Mere sensations can afford us no guide to our reac- 
tions. We would simply be subjected to infinitely more and 
keener irritations than is a one-celled ameeba, but with no 
more discretion as to our movements. Therefore we never do 
have simple sensations. Sensations exist only in combina- 
tions and associations. Just as certain chemical elements are 
found everywhere in abundance-but never occur in nature 
in an uncombined state, so sensations are ever present and 
form the basic material of all mental life, yet they never 
occur separately or uncombined. 
They are mental elements. The philosopher Locke uttered 
this famous dictum of psychology: Nihil est in intellectu 
quod non fuerit in sensu (“There is nothing in the mind which 
was not previously in the senses”). But Leibnitz added 
the qualifying phrase nisi intellectus ipse (“except the mind 
itself”). We do not eat carbon or oxygen or hydrogen or 
other raw chemicals, yet everything we do eat is composed of 
just such elements in combination. It may be true that there 
is nothing in the dinner which was not previously brought to 
the kitchen by the grocer’s delivery boy—except the mixing, 
blending, cooking, and serving ; but the appetizing dinner is a 
81 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
very different thing from the packages of raw foodstuffs 
which the boy delivered. So our knowledge of the world 
and of the objects of which it is made up consists wholly of 
the materials which came to us as sensations, yet, in the very 
process of the getting, it has become something quite dif- 
ferent from sensations. 
Necessity for organizing: Here is an apple in my hand. 
At the same instant I am receiving tactual sensations from 
the pen in my other hand, from the paper on which I write, 
from the clothing on various portions of my body, from the 
chair on which I sit, and from the breeze which strikes my 
face. I see a certain redness and greenness and round form of 
the apple, but I also see my hand, the desk in the back- 
ground, the paper, the wall, and numerous other things 
within the range of vision. At the same time I hear passing 
vehicles, a lawn mower across the street, and the crying of 
the neighbor’s baby. I smell the odor of gingerbread just 
coming from the oven in the kitchen, of the roses on my 
desk, and a faint fruity odor from the apple. From these 
varied objects there strikes upon my retine a jumble of light 
rays which pass as nerve currents to the occipital regions of 
the brain; a confusion of air waves which pass into the ears 
and start currents over the auditory nerves to a quite dif- 
ferent part of the brain; and various other stimulations 
entering by quite diverse senses and passing by wholly dif- 
ferent pathways to other distinct and widely separated brain 
centers. How is it possible from such a mass of stimulations 
to gather together just those which originated from the one 
object, rejecting all the others, and combine these into that 
experience which is my knowledge of the apple? What a 
confusion would result in the mind if there should chance 
to be united with the visual redness from the apple, say, the 
pinching of my left shoe, the odor of the gingerbread, and the 
crying of the neighbor’s baby! What a baffling object to deal
-P-A-G-E-95
  COMBINING SENSE MATERIALS—PERCEPTION 83 
with that would be! No knowledge or intelligence or any 
useful reaction would be possible if there were not some 
reliable agency within for recombining these fragmentary 
sense experiences into some sort of semblance to the things 
without. Lacking some such agency we could not know 
objects at all, and sensations could give us nothing but a 
whirling chaos of indistinguishable stimulations. 
The organizing activity of perception. This mysterious 
power residing in the brain which so marvelously rein- 
tegrates these scattered sense materials into mental objects, 
which creates objects as we know them out of sensations as 
we get them, is called perception. It is not a separate process 
which occurs after the sensations have been received, as 
digestion occurs after eating, but it is the way in which the 
sensations are received. There are no sensations except the 
perceived sensations. There is no perception without sensa- 
tion and no sensation without perception. It is immaterial 
whether we use the word “perception” to mean simply the 
combining of sensations or to mean the whole process of 
getting sensations in combination. Since we commonly speak 
of perceiving objects rather than of sensing objects and 
perceiving sensations, it is more convenient to think of the 
whole process as perception. Sensation proper involves the 
nerve tracts only from the sensory endings to the sensory 
centers in the brain, hence the other part of the perceptive 
process must involve tracts connecting these various brain 
centers with each other and with the association centers. 
Somewhere and somehow in the cortex, synapses, like those 
involved in habit and instinct, afford the pathways by which 
the sensory currents manage to get together in their proper 
relations. Here arises that mental experience which is the 
perception or idea of the object. 
Apperception. Thus the meaning or significance of any 
object present to the sense is not wholly a mere matter of
-P-A-G-E-96
  84 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
the sensations at the time received from it. The present sen- 
sations may, in fact, be a very insignificant part of the whole 
meaning to which we react. A slight sound which I can 
barely hear tells me that the fast express train is coming, 
that it is on time, that it is now passing a village three miles 
away, that I can just catch it at the station if I start imme- 
diately, and it also recalls the appearance of the train, the 
probable number of cars, and more other things about that 
train and trains in general than could be written in many 
pages. It is not the present sound sensation which governs 
my conduct in such a case, but the many things which are 
associated with that sound. The meaning of an object pres- 
ent to the senses is the perception of the thing plus all our 
related previous experiences, so far as the present one recalls 
them to mind, and it is the combination of all these which 
determines what we are going to do about it. Thus any 
object ordinarily means to us rather what we bring to it 
than what it brings to us. For this reason the same object 
may mean quite different things to different persons, because 
their previous experiences are different, though their present 
sensations may be identically alike. An object on my desk, 
used as a paper weight, was perceived by a visitor to be an 
odd sort of ink-bottle. To me, though seeing with my eyes 
just what he saw, it was a rifle grenade which I brought 
from a French battlefield, and it calls up countless memories 
of war and devastation quite unlike the suggestions of an 
ink-bottle. Consider three men walking through a forest: 
an artist, a lumberman, and a hunter. All three see the 
same things, but what a difference there will be in what 
they perceive! The reader can easily supply countless sim- 
ilar illustrations from his daily experiences. This further 
unifying activity of the perceptive process, this bringing 
to bear of past experiences upon a present object and thus 
giving it an interpretation or meaning, is called apperception.

  COMBINING SENSE MATERIALS—PERCEPTION 85 
(ad-perception, the act of perceiving to something else). It is; 
of course, not a separate process any more than perception is 
distinct from sensation. They are all one activity, and per- 
ception is the name applied to it all—the sensations, the 
combining of these into percepts of the objects, and the unit- 
ing of these with former experiences. There are thus three 
phases or aspects of perception. 
Imperfect perception. Perception, like all things human, 
is not infallible. It may be defective in any of its three as- 
pects. Defects in the sense organs, or inaccurate report due 
to carelessness, haste, or difficulty in getting the sensations, 
may give the mind very imperfect materials with which to 
work. Lack of attention and of thoughtful observation, par- 
ticularly on the apperceptive side, quite commonly prevents 
complete association of the sensations and of the new per- 
cept with its full meanings. Hasty observations, unless of 
very familiar things, are usually unreliable. The most pains- 
taking observation is necessary to perceive with certainty 
the many things which nature, art, or chance has caused to 
imitate the appearance of other things. A leaflike insect may 
deceive both bird and scientist. My notebook cover was so 
cleverly designed in imitation of leather that I had used it 
for weeks before discovering that it was a manufactured tex- 
tile. Such errors are prevented by more accurate and careful 
sense reports and by fuller and better-organized experience. 
Illusions. In spite of the most accurate observations, how- 
ever, certain kinds of erroneous perceptions are normal and 
natural. A mirage appears to the desert traveler like the 
long-sought oasis, though it proves to be but a reflection 
mirrored upon atmospheric strata of varying density. Ob- 
jects perceived through unusually clear mountain atmos- 
phere seem much nearer than they actually are. Vertically 
striped wall paper makes a room appear higher than it is, 
and vertically striped garments increase the apparent height
-P-A-G-E-100
  86 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
of the wearer. Tapering columns in architectural construc- 
tion usually appear to be collapsing at the center, and hence 
are actually bulged to make them appear straight. The in- 
teresting art of camouflage, so highly developed for military 
purposes during the World War, is a scientific production of 
deceptive perceptions on a large scale. Most magic, many 
forms of entertainment, and many of the arts of decoration 
are based on certain well-established tendencies of normal 
minds to perceive things as they are not. A most interesting 
aspect of psychological study deals with lines, forms, and 
color effects which regularly produce appearances unlike the 
reality. All such normal errors of perception are known as 
illusions. Normal illusions of the kinds mentioned are due to 
peculiarities of the associations aroused and are more or less 
imperfectly understood. Other illusions, such as mistaking 
a scarecrow for a ghost, are due to apperceiving a normal 
object to a defective mental content. 
Hallucinations. A more serious type of erroneous percep- 
tion occurs only in abnormal states of the nervous system 
and consists of some internal disturbance which purports to 
be due to an external stimulation of the sense organs. These 
are known as hallucinations. Conspicuous cases are such as 
are manifested in delirium tremens when the sufferer “sees 
snakes” and other loathsome creatures, in the seeing of a 
ghost when there is no object whatever to give rise to the 
perception, or in the many forms of hallucinations of the 
insane. Less serious cases are not uncommon among normal 
persons, such as hearing footsteps or hearing one’s name 
spoken when there has been no sound actually heard. Hallu- 
cinations are usually induced by mental strain or excitement, 
by nervous and hysterical states, by the use of various drugs, 
and by the nervous disorders resulting from the use of alco- 
hol, and they are commonly characteristic of insanity. The 
obvious preventive is good health and wholesome living.
-P-A-G-E-101
  COMBINING SENSE MATERIALS—PERCEPTION 87 
Reliable perceptions. Perception enters so largely into all 
mental life and the quality of it so largely determines the 
degree of one’s intelligence that it is well to note again that 
its efficiency depends on (1) the completeness of and accu- 
racy of the sensations obtained, (2) the reliability and 
permanency of their association by the original unifying 
tendency of the mind, and (3) the fullness, correctness, and 
practical value of the apperceptive association with other 
related knowledge. The first is a matter of well-developed 
keenness of the sense organs and attentive observation 
through as many of the senses as possible; the second also 
depends upon getting at one and the same time, and as forci- 
bly as possible, every sensation to which the thing may 
normally give rise. Look at it from every possible angle, 
handle it, move it about, use it if usable, taste it if tastable, 
smell it if smellable, and explore it in every way vigorously, 
thoroughly, and with careful attention. But it is on the third 
or apperceptive side of the perceptive process that there is 
the largest opportunity and necessity for voluntary improve- 
ment. This involves thinking about it from every possible 
angle. Recall others of its kind that you have seen and com- 
pare them as to likenesses and differences. Consider its uses, 
beauties, defects as a whole and as to each of its parts,— 
everything which can possibly add to its meaning and intelli- 
gent associations. Consider its value in money, for eating, 
for apple pies, for stock food. Think of the tree on which it 
grew, the blooms and the poetry they have inspired, the 
country where it grew, and the people who grew it, gathered 
it, packed, transported, and sold it; of its contributions to 
the earnings and happiness of each, its meaning to them; of 
the same sort of thing in other lands and times, and its possi- 
bilities for the future. Tie it up in your thinking with 
everything you could possibly want to think in connection 
with it in the course of your intelligent thinking in the future.

  88 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
If you have done all this you will really have seen the thing, 
perceived and apperceived it fully. 
Practical perception. Of course you protest that it is im- 
possible to make any such exhaustive study of every object 
one perceives. Quite so. It may be impracticable to study 
any object with such ideal thoroughness. Necessarily we 
must perceive a great many more things than one could 
humanly examine with any considerable degree of care and 
completeness. At every instant there are hundreds and thou- 
sands of possible objects of perception within the range of 
our senses. Of these we are more or less distinctly aware of 
the presence of a dozen or two, and of these we are actually 
giving our attention at any instant to but one. Of this one 
only a few aspects ordinarily concern us or claim our really 
attentive and vigorous consideration. The important thing 
to realize is that only these few aspects are really perceived 
and apperceived and only these become a lasting part of our 
equipment of knowledge and intelligence. We cannot hope 
to attend to all things, but neither can we hope to know the 
things to which we do not attend. Only in a very small 
measure is perception something which happens to us, some- 
thing done to us by things. It is essentially an activity of 
the mind, something we do about the things in reach of 
our senses. 
Seeing by suggestion. How little of what we perceive is 
actually seen by the eyes and how much is contributed by 
the mind is made quite evident by a little study of the crude 
drawings in the comic strips of our daily papers. The actual 
lines, shadings, or colorings bear slight resemblance to the 
objects they represent, yet they tell their story with a vivid- 
ness that is unmistakable. Slight changes in the lines of the 
drawings portray changes of expression with a clearness and 
accuracy beyond the power of words. Cartoonists make no 
effort to make their drawings look like the person they are

depicting. They but catch and express some distinctive char- 
acteristic, and our minds suggest the balance. The same is 
true in all our seeing. We see very little, indeed, of the 
objects with which our minds are dealing. We catch but the 
merest vague outline of a chair, a hat, a step, a door knob, 
etc. and react to them by means of the thoroughgoing pre- 
vious knowledge already acquired. It is the mental attitude 
or expectation far more than the sensation which determines 
our response. 
Perspective. Even the very small part of the whole per- 
ception which is actually contributed by the eyes is ordi- 
narily quite unlike the thing which it represents. A picture 
of a box or a table top, for example, reproduces the sort of 
image which the object affords to the eye. But this image is 
made up of acute and obtuse angles, whereas the object has 
only right angles. The object is uniform in breadth through- 
out its length, whereas the image, as seen, is much larger on 
the near side and tapers off toward a point as it recedes from 
the eye. A picture of a railroad track as seen from the center 
of it is like an A with many crossbars for the ties, although 
it would be hard to conceive of anything much less like the 
actual shape of the track than such a figure. Among the first 
things an artist must learn is that he does not draw things 
as they are, but as they appear. In reducing the appearances 
of things at differing distances to the plane of a picture, all of 
which is at the same distance, all receding lines must con- 
verge toward a single point, more distant objects are very 
much smaller than near ones, and there are differences in 
shading, coloring, and clearness of outline which correspond 
not at all to the actual objects but to their appearance from 
a fixed point of view. The science of representing things as 
they appear rather than as they are is called perspective. 
Perceiving solidity of objects. Skillful artists are able to 
paint pictures of solid objects so that they seem to “stand 
 
-P-A-G-E-106

90 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
out” in some degree. This is done by careful study and re- 
production of lights and shades. But the most perfect art 
or the most perfect photography cannot entirely overcome 
the effect of flatness in a picture. This is because the artist 
paints but one picture on his canvas while we see not one but 
two pictures when we look at a solid object. By looking 
past one object to another at greater distance, first with one 
eye and then with the other, you will readily note the dif- 
ference between the pictures given by the two eyes. Look at 
a round bottle with a label on the side with the left eye and 
notice exactly how far around each side you can see. Now 
look at it with the right eye, being careful to move neither 
head nor bottle, and note that you see farther around the 
right side with the right eye. Thus the two eyes give slightly 
different pictures of the bottle. So every object that we see 
in relief we see by means of two visual images which are 
combined in the brain into one visual percept. By means 
of the familiar instrument known as the stereoscope, through 
which one looks at two photographs but sees them as one, 
we may see objects standing out in almost startling relief. 
Examine these stereoscopic photographs carefully and you 
will observe that they are not just alike, but are taken from 
two points about as far apart as the distance between the 
eyes. The instrument merely bends the light rays so that 
the two pictures appear as one, just as the two one-eye pic- 
tures of objects are regularly combined into one. Many 
| interesting and amusing results may be obtained by using 
the stereoscope to present conflicting pictures to the two 
eyes, or part of a picture to one eye and part to the other, 
and by studying the combinations which these different pic- 
tures make as perceived. 
Perception of distance and size. We have no sort of sen- 
sation by which we perceive the distance of objects from the 
eyes. Distance is apperceived. An infant will reach for the

moon, a savage thinks of it as just beyond the hills; only 
modern science affords any definite idea of its distance. With 
one eye closed it is very difficult to place the finger exactly 
upon a point or to catch a ball. With two eyes we get cross 
lines of vision which enable us to place points accurately. 
It is mainly by the stereoscopic and perspective vision that 
we judge the distance of the objects; though the position of 
intervening objects, the softer coloring and less distinct out- 
line of distant objects, and the degree of muscular strain 
felt in focusing the eyes or converging them upon a near 
object all have much to do with our judgment of distance. 
Likewise we have no direct means of knowing the size of 
things by their appearance. A dime close to the eye appears 
much larger than a house a few rods away. A garden pea at 
arm’s length is as big as the moon to the eye. We are accus- 
tomed to infer the size of objects from what we know of 
their distance, or their distance from what we know of their 
size. Without either as a clue we can form no judgment at 
all. A picture of a fish or of a tree by itself gives no sugges- 
tion of size, hence it is customary to introduce into the pic- 
ture some object of known size, usually a person, and the 
size is immediately apparent. The same outline drawing may 
with equal accuracy represent a paper weight, a tombstone, 
or the Washington Monument; but the instant some fa- 
miliar object, as an inkstand or an automobile, is introduced 
into the picture the size intended is perfectly obvious. 
Time perception. If the perception of size and distance is 
a complex and indirect sort of process, the perception of 
time is much more so. The succession of day and night and 
of winter and summer are, of course, readily perceived by 
the numerous sensations and experiences to which they give 
rise. But a minute or an hour is not perceived directly and, in 
fact, has no existence in itself to be perceived. We cannot judge 
measures of time as we do measures of space, by comparison 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
92 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
with other things, because when we are at one end of an hour 
the other end is not yet in existence or has passed away for- 
ever. We can only vaguely perceive the amount of time in its 
passage by what we do or undergo as it passes. It is notable 
that sometimes “time passes quickly” and sometimes very 
slowly. What flies or drags is not time, but our mental 
states. We carry watches rather than yard sticks because 
our judgment of hours is so much less reliable than our judg- 
ment of yards. Rhythmic beats or movements such as we 
use in music and dancing are about the nearest approach we 
have to any actual means within ourselves of measuring the 
passage of time. Beyond this we judge by purely objective 
or external means or we guess with very little accuracy. 
Perception is functional. In closing this chapter on how 
we are aware of things it is important to emphasize the 
fact that it is the nature of the mind to apperceive any 
object primarily to the idea of its use. Consciously or un- 
consciously we are always asking of any object: “What is it 
for?” “What does it do?” ‘What do we do with it?” This 
is the primary and the most essential meaning of every ob- 
ject. If it can do nothing to us or for us, or if we can do 
nothing to it or with it, it ceases to have any meaning or 
interest for us. The mind is essentially practical and acts 
for the service of its possessor. It will have nothing to do 
with the thing with which it can do nothing. We perceive 
an apple as something to eat, to buy or sell or cook, etc. A 
table is something to write on, a chair is to sit on, a house is 
to live in, etc. The savage and the little child think of objects 
in this concrete, practical way. Even in our most abstract 
thinking the function or use is the principal meaning by 
which we know and think all our ideas. To us in psychology 
an apple is something used to illustrate perception, sensa- 
tion is a term wsed to indicate a certain mental process.

Further study of perception. It is not practicable for us 
to give more space to the subject of perception, but in a 
different field of psychology you will find many delightfully 
interesting and curious facts about the way we perceive 
things with our eyes, ears, and other senses. How we can 
judge the location of sounds, how we hear one sound by the 
two ears, how we judge of the size of things by touch, how 
we locate a touch on the skin, how we can move and balance 
our bodies under the guidance of the kinesthetic perception, 
how we handle and manipulate things by the feel of them, 
how the mind solves puzzle-pictures and many strange and 
baffling forms of illusions, are some of the problems studied 
in perception. 
EXERCISES 
1. Define perception and show its exact relation to sensation. 
2. To what extent is it true that “there is nothing in the mind 
which was not previously in the senses” ? 
3. Familiarize yourself with the perception process by carefully 
examining several objects, some familiar and some unfamiliar, and 
noting in each case: (1) just what sensations are obtained from the 
object; (2) through what different channels these are sent to the 
brain; (3) in what different parts of the brain they are received; 
(4) to what previous knowledge, or apperceptive cores, they are 
united; (5) how this serves to perceive’ the object. 
4, Define apperception, meaning, illusion, hallucination, and show 
the relation of each to perception. 
5. What physiological differences in the brain would correspond 
to the difference between an idea that has little meaning and one 
that has much meaning ? ‘ 
6. Give instances of different persons perceiving quite different 
things from hearing the same lecture, reading the same book, walking 
down the same street, or otherwise getting the same sensations.
-P-A-G-E-110
  94 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
7. Give instances from your own experience of details of ob- 
jects—such as a plant, a tree, a house, a bird, or an animal—which 
you now see readily after having studied objects of the sort closely, 
but which you did not see at all before such study. How do you 
account for this ? 
8. Explain psychologically what this means: “Having eyes they 
see not and having ears they hear not.” 
9. Give instances of illusions which were intentionally arranged. 
10. Give instances of illusions which were wholly unintentional. 
11. Can you give instances of serious loss, accident, difficulties, 
or confusion due. to illusions? How could each of these have been 
avoided by mental preparation ? 
12. How is it that a bank teller can instantly detect counterfeit 
money or a jeweler a false stone, whereas others with equally keen 
senses are completely deceived ? 
18. How could you develop the capacity to detect quickly the 
quality of woolen or linen or silk goods? Would this capacity be 
worth developing ? 
14, What particular keenness of perception would be especially 
useful to you in your present or future occupation? How could 
you develop it ? 
15. Prepare a card to fit the stereoscope, but having in place of 
the usual photographs a bird on one side and a cage on the other. 
See the bird go into the cage. By properly placing any part of a 
picture on one side and the remainder on the other, the two are 
combined through the stereoscope. Put contradictory figures or 
colors on the two sides and see the puzzling contradiction in vision. 
16. Why is it so difficult to find the hidden figures in a puzzle- 
picture at first, but so easy after they are once found?

  CHAPTER VII 
CONCEPTS 
Need for further unifying. That strange integrating, or- 
ganizing, connecting-up force of our mental life by no means 
ends with the perceptive processes already described. The 
most perfect perception, however thorough the sense activity 
and complete the apperception, can deal only with objects 
then present to the senses. It tells only of the present and 
can give no knowledge of any experience that has passed. It 
cannot so much as provide the stored-up products of past 
experience necessary for its own apperception; much less 
can it give us any clue or guide to our reactions—the end for 
which all intelligence exists and without which all mental 
processes would be vain. Then, too, even if the countless 
past experiences of a lifetime were all stored vividly and 
ready for use in the memory, it would be impossible and use- 
less to apperceive a present object with each of a thousand or 
two distinct experiences of such objects. In the presence of a 
growling dog or a dish of ice cream the business of associating 
the present situation with each of several thousand former 
dog or ice-cream experiences would probably occupy us until 
the opportunity to escape the one or consume the other were 
irretrievably gone. We have obvious need for a practical and 
expeditious means of bringing to bear the consolidated total 
of past related experiences so as to give us instantly the 
meaning of the perceived present. Hence we have such a 
power. 
Concepts. As the integrating of our sensations into an 
idea of a thing and the further associating of this idea with 
96
-P-A-G-E-113
  
CONCEPTS 97 
similar ideas already acquired is designated as perception, 
so the gradual uniting of these associated ideas into a single, 
compact, usable one is known as concept-forming. A percept 
is the immediate result of the sense process, while a concept 
is the accumulated combination of any number of percepts 
acquired from time to time. That collective idea of “dog” 
which we have, made up of the net proceeds of all our experi- 
ences related to dogs, is a very much condensed, concen- 
trated, telescoped sort of thing. It is so simple and compact 
that we use it with perfect readiness in our talking and 
thinking and in determining our reactions to situations as 
they arise, without its even occurring to us that it has 
been compounded of elements derived from countless varied, 
dissimilar, and otherwise forgotten dogs. Just what form 
this condensed idea may have it is impossible to describe. 
But description is entirely unnecessary. Each of us has 
abundant first-hand knowledge. Whatever is the idea of 
apple or of dog, of cabbage or of king, that you may have at 
the instant when you read the word or hear it or use it, that 
is your concept—at least for the moment. It is the idea you 
think with. 
Formal and informal concepts. Like all things mental, 
the working concept is in constant change. Most concepts 
have as many faces, colors, and aspects as a diamond flash- 
ing in the sun. Examine carefully the idea you have of a dog 
or of a man, and you will find that it shifts, changes, dis- 
solves, and reappears in another form, vanishes, and you are 
probably thinking of something else. As you ordinarily use 
any concept idea in thinking, it probably involves some more 
or less faint or vivid flitting mental image. Probably you 
have a picture of some individual specimen of the class, and 
that in some very definite situation. Possibly you glimpse 
some partial feature of the thing, the balance being hazy and 
indistinct. Or you may have a fleeting picture of the word
-P-A-G-E-114
  98 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
which represents the idea. Whatever form it may take it is 
but a flash-light glimpse, gone before it is clearly seen. The 
particular form it assumes is difficult to explain and impos- 
sible to predict. But this uncertain, unreliable, intangible, 
flash-light picture is not the essence of the concept. It is a 
form of imagery which will be discussed later. Back of this 
imagery must be the actual meaning-content of the idea. 
Your concept of cat or cow is whatever the word means to 
you as you use it. It is whatever would be involved in your 
definition of the word. It is a permanent, though growing, 
idea which includes every individual of that particular sort 
which you have experienced and excludes all others. This 
formal concept may be said to include the ideas that are com- 
mon to all the percepts which have gone to make it up. It is 
essentially an idea of a class of things, the class being made 
up of those individuals which for any reason have been 
grouped together in the mind; for example, it may be the 
idea of man, of white man, of American, of Democrat, of 
Methodist, of Tennesseean, of Bostonian, of metal worker, 
of farmer, of professional man, of dude, of good man, of lazy 
man, etc. ad infinitum. These classes may overlap, coincide, 
and cross each other in many ways. One individual may be 
classed in several groups. The concept is the idea of a group, 
however adequately or inadequately made up. Also, one has 
concepts of individual things; that is, the composite idea 
made up from many experiences of the same thing, as one’s 
idea of New York, of his house, of his automobile, etc. 
Scientists deal with very formal, clearly defined concepts. 
People generally think with pretty loose, indefinite, hap- 
hazard concept ideas. 
Genesis of a concept. Let us consider more fully just 
what takes place in the building up of a concept, say, one’s 
concept of “dog.” The child’s first experience in this con- 
nection may have been with a family pet. His first, hazy,
-P-A-G-E-115
  CONCEPTS 99 
big-black-hairy-barking-thing perception left its impress in 
the form of synaptic connections in his brain. Each subse- 
quent perception united itself with this in the cortex, while 
the idea became gradually clarified into a notion of an animal 
with head, ears, legs, tail, teeth, hair, etc. (the concepts of 
these things also being very vague, undefined, and perhaps 
unnamed). As the idea takes on more definite form through 
repeated but varying experiences, it becomes associated with 
the word which is used in the family to represent it—“ Fido,” 
perhaps, or “bowwow.” In time the child encounters the 
neighbor’s poodle, which, having certain points of resem- 
blance to Fido, is automatically referred to the same con- 
cept. He perhaps points to it and says, “Fido,” at which 
parents laugh and tell him, “No; dog.” Later he sees a cat 
or a goat or possibly a horse and identifies it as “Fido.” 
More laughing at him and more new words. Always the 
tendency is to group together those objects having resem- 
blance to each other, either in appearance or use or some 
other kind of similarity. As words are given in these connec- 
tions, these become permanently identified with the idea of 
the group. Thus, as experiences multiply, things running 
around on four legs are gradually classified into their respec- 
tive named groups, and “dog” comes to stand for all those 
recognized but poorly defined characteristics which consti- 
tute the essence of the dog idea. The child knows a dog when 
he sees one, for each new percept of the class is immediately 
apperceived to the growing concept. Occasional encounters 
with a mastiff, a hairless Mexican, or a dachshund may neces- 
sitate rather radical revision of the dog concept, but it is by 
these revisions that the concept is enlarged and clarified. 
“Bowwow” is thrown into the discard among the unhappy 
wastes of childish learning, “Fido” is suitably limited to use 
as the proper name for an individual, while “dog” is identi- 
. fied with the general and growing group concept.
-P-A-G-E-116
  foo PSYCHOLOGY AND a 
t 
Concept values. At the same time, in addition to its con- 
tent, the idea is taking on a more or less definite meaning or 
value significance. To the little girl the dog idea includes the 
notion of “thing that might bite” ; to her brother it is “com- 
panion to play with”; and later it signifies more or less 
permanently, according to one’s occupation, “hunter,” 
“house-guard,” “sheep-driver,” “something to pet,” “thing 
that tracks dirt in the house,” or “convenient material 
for vivisection and medical experiment.” The zodlogist’s 
idea of a dog as “a carnivorous domesticated mammal of the 
suborder Fissipedia and the genus Canis,” while logically 
more formal, is psychologically no more truly a concept than 
the less scientific ones we have been considering, nor is it 
necessarily any more valuable for practical thinking except in 
the particular field of classified zodlogy. The meaning which 
any concept shall have depends on the ideas which are asso- 
ciated with it during its formation. The value of it depends 
on the efficiency of that associated meaning for affecting the 
thinking and the conduct into which it enters. Those asso- 
ciations which have been most persistently built into a con- 
cept in the learning of it are the ones which will be most 
effective in its use. The unlimited variety of forms which 
they assume suggests that concepts may be made to take on 
any character and value which we may wish them to have. 
To the grower apples mean labor and profit, to the consumer 
they mean expense and gustatory pleasure, to the artist they 
mean form and color. If you would have apples mean dollars ° 
to you, you must think of them in terms of financial profit. 
If you would have life mean happiness to you, think of its 
joys; if you would be a pessimist, dwell on its disap- 
pointments. 
Useful and useless concepts. A most serious waste of ef- 
fort in study is in acquiring concepts with slight values for 
%; _ the purposes which they are intended to serve. Properties of   
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  CONCEPTS IO 
verbs are presumably learned as a means of more accurate 
communication of thought, yet in the mind of the pupil they 
are often identified as disagreeable tasks to be endured, as 
a means of satisfying the requirements of the teacher, of 
securing a coveted mark or promotion, or, possibly, as a sort 
of penalty for attending school. Concepts acquired in the 
study of rhetoric sometimes function only in recitations and 
examinations and are bound up with each other into a system 
which is useless outside of the rhetoric class, instead of being 
associated with one’s writing and speech activities as a 
means of more forceful expression. Algebra is often a series 
of mathematical concepts useless outside of school classes in 
mathematics, whereas it should function as an easier and 
more economical method of performing difficult operations. 
A knowledge of psychology too often consists of a mass of 
laboriously acquired concepts about sensations, memory, and 
such things, faintly associated with each other and scarcely 
connected at all with the practical needs of daily life. If such 
should be the result of the study of this book, it would not 
be worth the time expended upon it. It would be easy to 
multiply instances of this sort, and thinking about them 
would be a profitable exercise for the student. Every con- 
cept worth acquiring in school or out of it is of value exactly 
in proportion as it can be used practically in some sort of 
thinking or doing. The wise learner will continuously insist 
upon inquiring, “What is its meaning?” and “What is its 
use to me?” in connection with every concept acquired ; and 
the meaning which he will accept is not simply some other 
words which lead him around in a circle and back to the 
point whence he started, but a meaning which will relate the 
new idea to others already clear, on the one hand, and to 
something that is worth knowing or doing, on the other. 
Cortical islands. A concept, or group of related concepts, 
disconnected from all associations which give it value and
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
application is aptly called a “cortical island.” This isolated 
area of synaptic connections, set apart from the vitalizing 
activity of the main body of the association areas, lacks ap- 
perceptive force and enters slightly or not at all into judg- 
ment and reasoning. No ideas need necessarily be of this 
sort. If any are in fact so isolated, it is because they are 
incompletely learned, and the more perfect learning would 
consist in discovering the related meanings. There is noth- 
ing that is worth learning in any field of study—history, 
geography, grammar, mathematics, chemistry, biology, 
economics, ancient or modern languages, or any other sub- 
ject—which has not some vital relations with many other 
concepts in that subject. It is less closely but no less truly 
related to every idea in the same field and ultimately has its 
associations with everything worth knowing in every field 
of thought. There should be no place in a well-ordered mind 
for unrelated ideas. The values of every concept must be 
measured in terms of its associations. The more abundantly 
and completely these associations are fixed, the richer and 
more useful the knowledge acquired. 
Selective purpose. But while there are no limits to the 
associations which it is possible to make in connection with 
any one concept, practically it may as well be associated 
with nothing as with all things equally. Of all possible asso- 
ciations most would be merely forced and fantastic, but some 
few are absolutely essential to the usefulness of the concept. 
The connections worth establishing are those that are serv- 
iceable, and these must be selected with reference to some 
central aim or purpose. An oak may be apperceived as 
shade; as a producer of acorns; as connected with Druidic 
worship and thus with ancient history and England; as a 
subject for poetry or art; as firewood; as fence-posts; as 
material for furniture, for floors, for ship construction; as a

storm; as a place for birds’ nests; as dollars of cash value or 
as cost of removal, etc.; and each of these associations may 
readily lead to hundreds of others. A botanist, however, 
would make very little progress if he attempted to make all 
these possible associations. He is concerned with one set of 
associations, and the lumberman with another. Effective 
study must consist in associating with each concept just 
those related ideas which will be of value for the purpose in 
hand. If one’s aim in the study of grammar is to speak and 
write correctly, his new ideas must be applied in his speak- 
ing and writing. If his aim is to be well and strong, each 
truth learned in the study of physiology must be thought of 
and applied in his mode of daily life. The study of history 
will not function to enable one to understand present-day 
politics unless the association with the present problems is 
actually made. If one’s aim is to be a physician, an engineer, 
a teacher, a business man, his command of knowledge in his 
chosen field is measured almost entirely by the thoroughness 
and persistency with which he thinks his every newly learned 
concept into connection with his life aim.

  CHAPTER VIII 
JUDGMENT AND REASONING 
Judgment and reasoning defined. When one definitely as- 
sociates a perceived object with a concept (as when, for in- 
stance, he thinks of an object in his hand, “This is an apple’’) 
or when he associates one concept with another (as in the 
assertion “An apple is a fruit”), he is performing what 
psychologists call an act of judgment. Reasoning is the 
process of connecting up a number of judgments in a series 
in such manner as to reach some new judgment. An example 
of reasoning might ‘be as follows: (1) this is an isosceles 
triangle; (2) the base angles in any isosceles triangle are 
equal to each other; therefore (3) angles A and B, the base 
angles of this triangle, are equal to each other. Here (1) is a 
judgment regarding a perceived object, the triangle before 
us; (2) is a previously formed judgment regarding the rela- 
tion of certain concepts to each other; and (3) is the new 
judgment arising from the relations discovered between the 
other two judgments and is the conclusion of this bit of 
reasoning. It gives us the answer to the question we had in 
mind as to the equality of the angles A and B. 
A further synthesizing activity. Judgment and reasoning, 
then, are primarily a further extension of the same principle 
of association or unifying which we have seen is the funda- 
mental characteristic of all mental activity. These higher 
processes have their physiological background in the same 
sort of synaptic connections as habits, percepts, and con- 
cepts. An association of ideas in the mind is evidently the 
counterpart of a joining together of synaptic series in the 
105
-P-A-G-E-122
  106 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
association areas of the cortex. The synapses involved in 
thinking “an isosceles triangle” are energized in connection 
with those involved in “equality of base angles” and leave 
connecting paths by reason of which this characteristic is 
thereafter thought as an integral part of the “isosceles tri- 
angle” concept. When angles A and B are perceived in a 
triangle which has been apperceived as isosceles, they are 
apperceived along the pathways associating them with base 
angles of an isosceles triangle and hence as equal angles. 
As in habit formation the previously used synapses consti- 
tute a preferred pathway over which the energy readily 
passes. Thus it is that “previous knowledge” serves as a 
core to which new related experiences are apperceived. In 
fact the new ideas can be acquired only as they can to some 
extent utilize the old pathways to get a footing. We can 
know new things only through their relations to old. In 
judgment we are connecting these synaptic areas which repre- 
sent the concepts involved; in reasoning we extend these 
areas into series and systems. A well-stored mind means a 
brain characterized by well-organized synaptic areas; a 
clear, quick mind depends on well-established and readily 
functioning associations among these. Thorough knowledge 
is dependent on thoroughly fixed pathways, and hazy ideas 
are due to pathways poorly formed. 
The function of intelligence. It is this’ cumulative organi- 
zation of experiences that gives meaning to all intellectual 
activity. Sensations, percepts, and concepts would all be use- 
less if we could not ultimately organize them into conclu- 
sions and decisions which in turn find their way out into our 
actions. \"We-recall that a reflex act is merely a simple way 
by which oui organisms can react to the situations in which 
they find themselves, an immediate connection between the 
incoming sensory stimulations.and the outgoing response 
through the motor nerves and_muscles| Intelligence, includ- 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
JUDGMENT AND REASONING 107 
ing the sensations, percepts, and concepts by which we know 
the world about us and the judgment and reasoning which 
interpret this knowledge and give us decisions as to what 
we should do,—the whole intellectual process,—is but a 
very elaborate way of directing our responses to the stimu- 
lations which we receive through the senses. With this gift 
we may utilize to guide our responses not only all the stimu- 
lations of the moment but all the experiences and judgments 
of the past. Indeed, we may bring to bear upon our decisions 
not merely our own experiences but more or less of the ex- 
periences of the people of all times. The cream of this 
experience and thought of humanity has been communicated 
to us in the course of years of instruction. It is just to give 
us this priceless experience and the accumulated judgments 
of humanity that systems of education with their schools 
and books and teachers are put at our disposal—all, that 
we may more wisely and effectively direct our own behavior 
for the good of ourselves and others. It is a far cry from 
the simple dodging from a flying missile to the scientific 
elimination of typhoid fever, but both are merely ways 
of protecting ourselves from danger. The one is simple, 
direct, and individual; while the other involves the codp- 
erative perceiving, thinking, and reacting of countless in- 
telligent people through many ages and is for the benefit 
not merely of the one or a few but of limitless unborn 
generations who did not participate in the original efforts, 
but will receive the conclusions already thought out and 
ready to be acted upon. 
Reasoning replaces blind instinct as guide. While there 
will always be need for more or less of direct instinctive re- 
sponses to simple situations, the wiser conduct is usually that 
which is to some extent guided by intelligence and training. 
In the presence of a threatening dog, sheer instinctive fear 
would impel one to run and scream, which is, perhaps, the
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
most certain way of getting bitten. Judgment might impel 
one to try to kick or frighten the dog. The success of this 
plan would depend largely on the dog, but it involves the 
restraint of one impulse and substitution of another in accord 
with judgment. An act of still better judgment would be to 
speak to the dog in a fearless, friendly way. Doubtless this 
would result in conquering the dog, but it would begin in con- 
quering oneself. The instinctive impulses to flee and to fight 
are older in the human race than control by intelligence and 
are more effective unless the habit of reasoning quickly 
and acting accordingly has been developed. But controlling 
and directing instinctive impulses is precisely the business 
of human intelligence. If my intelligence is not greater than 
the dog’s, we must both depend on impulses, and the contest 
between us must be one of relative skill with legs and teeth. 
The case is not very different in the contests between men 
and men. When interests conflict, animal impulses prompt 
each to terrorize the other into fear by a show of fight. If the 
one yields, the other remains conqueror, like the proverbial 
cock of the walk. It is not the rule of the fittest, but the 
rule of the “fightingest.” Others are sure to contest the 
right of anyone to so dominate, hence there are endless wars 
and strife, mutually destructive to all participants. The 
“direct action” type of settling difficulties tends to degen- 
erate into merely acting upon impulse. The habit of acting 
under the guidance of the best thought means the substitu- 
tion of law and government and the gradual perfection of 
these to the point where justice and democracy insure the 
greatest safety and happiness of all. The habit of acting 
from impulse tends backward to primitive life, while the 
substitution of judgment tends to elevate the impulses them- 
selves as well as to make them less necessary for guidance. 
Human evolution is a process of substituting intelligence 
for instinctive action.

JUDGMENT AND REASONING 109 
The forms of reasoning —logic. Judgments and reason- 
ing may take on as many different forms as there are possible 
different ways of uniting ideas together. These possible ways 
are as numerous as the infinite relations of things in the 
universe or the possible associative combinations of synapses 
in the cortex. Logic is the science which seeks to classify all 
possible forms of judgment and reasoning and to discover 
the laws that determine which are valid and which are not, 
which are necessarily true and which are liable to error. 
Naturally we cannot attempt to include even a summary of 
this ancient and abstruse science within the compass of our 
elementary study. We shall merely indicate, without tech- 
nical terms, a few of the characteristic types of thought 
processes in order to show some of the dangers into which 
we are prone to fall in using them. 
Perceptual judgments. We have seen that a judgment 
may be the act of identifying a perceived object with a con- 
cept—simply a definite and formal apperception. As such it 
is subject not only to all the errors which may arise from 
imperfect observation and association but also to all the 
imperfections in the concepts to which we are relating the 
percept. Recall my supposedly leather-bound notebook. If 
I had examined more closely I might have observed a sur- 
face marking indicative of thread texture, and an absence of 
the leather odor. I did vaguely perceive a cottony, frayed 
point at one corner, but failed to associate it as an indication 
of the texture of the binding. I simply failed to “think 
about it” and hence definitely to apperceive it. Then, too, 
my concept of leather-bound notebook was defective in that 
it did not exclude books as cheap as the one I was buying. 
So my judgment, “This is a leather-bound notebook,” was 
erroneous through three distinct defects: (1) the sense per- 
ception was superficial, (2) the concept involved was in- 
adequately formed in my previous experiences, and (3) the
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
association of percept with concept was careless. However, 
“Experience is the best teacher,” and through this experience 
I revised the concept, acquired a better method of checking 
up the judgment, and was forewarned to make thereafter 
more careful observations in similar situations. 
Conceptual judgments. Any association of concepts to- 
gether likewise may be regarded as a judgment, whether the 
connection between them is due to relations directly per- 
ceived among things or is established only through a long 
series of intermediate judgments. “Sugar is sweet” is based 
directly upon observation; while such a judgment as ‘“Ma- 
laria is contracted only through the bite of the Anopheles 
mosquito” required a long process of reasoning and experi- 
ment for its establishment. The primitive, instinctive tend- 
ency in forming judgments is simply to hold together any 
ideas which have once been experienced together and to 
replace them by equally untested judgments which happen 
by chance to be more vividly impressed. Intelligence is 
necessary to discriminate between those associations which 
are properly and those which are improperly made. “Steel 
sinks” was a sufficiently conclusive argument for many 
people to conclude that ships could not be made of steel. 
Most people at one time were convinced that the world did 
not turn over, because if it did, everything loose would fall 
off from it. } 
Generalizations. Such statements as “Steel sinks” or 
“Sugar is sweet” are assertions that something which has 
been observed to be true in certain instances is true of all 
possible instances of the sort. We have actually observed in 
only a few instances that steel sinks, but we make the asser- 
tion quite general. We have tasted very little of all the sugar 
that exists, has existed, or will exist, but we make the state- 
ment “Sugar is sweet” absolutely universal of all actual or 
possible sugar. Such sweeping statements are called general-
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  JUDGMENT AND REASONING — III 
izations or universal statements. It is only by thus extending 
the observations made in certain known instances to others 
that are unknown that practical thinking can be done at all. 
Merely knowing that a certain lump of sugar that I once 
tasted was sweet does not help me to sweeten my coffee this 
morning. I must extend that judgment and conclude that this 
sugar also is sweet. Merely knowing that John Brown drank 
wood alcohol and died cannot save my life any more than it 
can restore John’s. But reasoning from the observation 
“Wood alcohol poisoned John Brown” to the generalization 
“Wood alcohol is poisonous” enables me to judge that I must 
avoid that poison if I would save my life. All the knowledge 
of psychology that we are acquiring is based on the assump- 
tion that things we have found true in some cases which have 
occurred will prove true in other cases which have not yet 
occurred. The same is true of all science and of all knowl- 
edge of every sort which can possibly affect our conduct in 
the situations which have not yet arisen. This statement is 
in itself a very broad generalization. Individual facts exist 
only in and for themselves. Intelligence makes use of them 
by means of generalizations. 
But if individual instances in themselves are of no value 
in guiding our responses to other situations, neither can our 
necessary generalizations be derived except from those same 
particular cases. General truths cannot be observed directly. 
Such general truths as “Ships float” or “Stones are heavy” 
are not physical truths at all. They exist only in mind. 
“Oak trees bear acorns” is a thing that does not exist in 
nature. In the world outside of mind each stone may be 
heavy, each ship may float, each oak tree may bear acorns, 
but any one instance of the kind is quite separate and inde- 
pendent of any other. Ships do not float collectively nor 
trees bear acorns in common. The physical world gives us 
individual instances; the mind of the observer brings these
-P-A-G-E-128
112 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
  together into generalizations. The individual instances or 
particular cases are called particulars or facts or data. Data 
means things given to us, the materials with which we 
start thinking. A fact means a thing done, something which 
happened regardless of our minds or their laws and activities. 
These are the original mental materials given us by percep- 
tion for use in all our thinking, the mental bricks with which 
we must build, the original returns from the physical world 
behind which we may not go. Judgment cannot be reliable 
if we do not get our facts straight. If these are in question 
we must go back to the sensations and perception by which 
they were given. The fault is not in the thinking. If data are 
accepted on authority of other observers, we must investi- 
gate their testimony. But the structure we build with these 
mental bricks, the interpretation we make of these mental 
data, depends on the soundness of our judgments and rea- 
soning. A witness in court is permitted to state only facts. 
“The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,” in 
his case, consists in.data only. He is forbidden to give gen- 
eralizations or opinions. It is the business of the judge and 
jury to construct these facts into a judgment. Facts, then, 
are useless as such, but they are the only sort of stuff out of 
which generalizations, and hence all usable knowledge, judg- 
ments, or opinions, can be made. 
Inductive reasoning. The making of generalizations from 
our facts or data is obviously a very fundamental sort of 
thinking. Intelligent action would be impossible and in- 
telligence useless without it. The kind of reasoning which 
proceeds from the knowledge of data or particulars to the 
judgments which are accepted as general or universal truths 
is called inductive reasoning. It.leads in to or up to the gen- 
eralization; hence the term in-duct-ive. Untrained minds 
tend to jump immediately from any observed fact to a 
generalization. The tendency is instinctive and characterizes 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  JUDGMENT AND REASONING 113 
primitive thought. “Snakes are poisonous,” “Chinamen are 
thieves,” “Poor people have no love for refinement,” “The 
rich have no sympathy for the poor,”’— these are specimens of 
the pernicious hasty generalizations which mislead much 
practical thinking and often result in unwise action. True 
induction demands, first of all, that the generalizations be 
not extended farther than the facts justify; that we do not 
“jump to conclusions.” In asserting that coal will burn, 
there is not much danger of going astray, because the essen- 
tial chemical nature of coal is such that under proper condi- 
tions it certainly will burn. We may say without the slightest 
hesitation that apples grow on trees (even though we can 
give no reason why), because no apple was ever known 
to grow otherwise. In stating that triangles always have 
three sides we are absolutely sure of our induction, because 
triangle means a figure of three sides. That every point in 
the circumference of a perfect circle is equally distant from 
the center we know to be true, even though we have never 
measured the distance on any circle or even though an abso- 
lutely perfect circle never did exist. That they are poisonous 
can be correctly asserted only of certain kinds of snakes. 
That they are thieves can be asserted only of particular indi- 
viduals among Chinamen, just as it can of individuals of 
other races. To make a safe assertion as to just what pro- 
portion of them are thieves would involve an observation of 
facts fully as broad as the statement extends. The fact that 
one of a group proves dishonest gives no indication that a 
second is likewise, though popular thinking commonly draws 
such inductions. The fact that one hundred of a given group 
have all proved dishonest does not prove that the one hun- 
dred and first is likewise, though the presumption becomes 
so strong that we shall be wise to watch him. The puzzling 
problem of the degrees of certainty and of probability in 
generalizations we will discuss more fully in our next chapter.  
-P-A-G-E-130
114. PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
The steps in complicated inductions. In the more complex 
and formal types of inductive thinking several definite steps 
are distinguishable. In the first place, there must be a clear 
conception of the problem one is trying to solve. There must 
be a question which the thinking seeks to answer. Other- 
wise the thinking would ramble in various directions and 
perhaps arrive nowhere. The modern method of conquer- 
ing disease admirably illustrates the inductive method of 
reaching true generalizations. It is immaterial just how the 
scientists first hit upon the guess that malaria might be 
transmitted by means of the bites of mosquitoes. So long as 
the problem in their minds was simply, “How is malaria 
caused?” attention was directed toward night air, an imagi- 
nary “miasma,” and similar useless quests. When a French 
surgeon in 1880 discovered a definite germ in the blood of 
his malaria patients and established the generalization that 
malaria is a germ disease, the problem narrowed to “How is 
this malaria germ planted in the system?” Other observa- 
tions soon narrowed the inquiry still further to “Do mos- 
quitoes transmit malaria?” This assumption became the 
working hypothesis which was to guide a very large amount 
of thought and experiment. A hypothesis is a generalization 
which it is sought to establish, stated as a question or as a 
possibility. It is the beginning and the “guiding principle 
of inductive reasoning. The next step in this induction was 
to examine all known facts regarding the nature and the 
prevalence of the disease to see if any of them precluded this 
possibility. Does malaria occur in any section where mos- 
quitoes do not? Is the microdrganism which causes the 
disease of such a nature that it could be carried by mosqui- 
toes? Are the structure and habits of the mosquito such that 
it is possible for it to take the germ from one infected person 
and implant it in another? Such evidence demands an enor- 
mous amount of observation and study, and its result is only
-P-A-G-E-131
  JUDGMENT AND REASONING 11s 
negative. It leaves the hypothesis possible but not proved. 
If the result of these investigations is favorable to the hypoth- 
esis, it could be stated with somewhat more assurance as 
a theory. A theory is a hypothesis which has been carefully 
investigated and appears to be borne out by all known facts, 
but which is not yet regarded as proved. There must now 
follow careful investigation of a large number of cases, es- 
pecially those in which the conditions have been so con- 
trolled as to eliminate all other factors except the one being 
tested. It had been generally supposed that malaria was 
caused by the miasmatic air of the marshes. Hence certain 
English scientists built mosquito-proof houses in the most 
miasmatic sections of the Roman Campagna—a region noted 
for malaria. They exposed themselves to every supposed 
cause except the mosquitoes, and entirely escaped the disease. 
Then mosquitoes which had bitten malaria patients were 
taken to London, where malaria had never existed, and were 
allowed to bite perfectly healthy persons—and these persons 
promptly contracted the disease. While this evidence ren- 
dered the theory altogether probable, it was not regarded as 
demonstrated until the germ had actually been discovered in 
the mosquito and the precise mode of its injection into the 
human victim clearly traced. The criminal must be caught 
red-handed in the act. This was done; but it was also known 
that many persons bitten by mosquitoes, even in regions 
where malaria was prevalent, did not necessarily contract 
the disease. Ultimately it was shown that only the females 
of the Anopheles genus of mosquito possessed the habits 
and the anatomy necessary to make them malaria carriers. 
Then it was that the principle could be positively stated that 
the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito is the only means 
of contracting malaria. Even yet it may be possible that 
some other means of communicating it may be discovered, 
but the original hypothesis may now be safely stated as a
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
true generalization, with the qualifying terms which limit 
it to the particular genus Anopheles. Thus we see that a 
formal induction involves (1) a hypothesis, (2) a study and 
comparison of all available data; (3) a thorough testing by 
means of experiments which eliminate all other possible fac- 
tors and, if possible, an actual tracing of causal connections ; 
(4) a statement of the truth as established, accurately cor- 
rected to meet all facts. In teaching, the “five formal steps 
of induction” are usually given as (1) preparation by lead- 
ing the pupil to appreciate the problem, (2) presentation of 
facts, (3) comparison of these facts, (4) statement of the 
generalization, and (5) testing it out in application. 
Deductive reasoning. But generalizations, we know, are 
but abstract ideas. The knowledge regarding malaria, so 
laboriously attained by induction, must be applied in actual 
conduct if we are to rid ourselves of the danger of this 
disease. The sort of thinking which applies a generalization 
is called deductive reasoning. It leads down from or out 
from the general truth to a specific situation; hence the 
term. In the case under consideration deduction must 
find means of eliminating mosquito bites. Nets, smudges, 
and odors repellent to the insect were tested and found only 
imperfectly effective. The pest must be entirely suppressed. 
This demanded a complete knowledge of its life history. It 
was found inductively that the mosquito breeds only in stag- 
nant water and that the “wiggler” is its larval state; hence 
there must be no stagnant water accessible to them during 
the seasons in which they breed. Rain barrels must be dry or 
screened. Tin cans and other receptacles must be removed 
and puddles and ditches drained. This was not altogether 
possible. So it was discovered, inductively again, that a 
skim of kerosene on the surface of standing water pre- 
vented the breeding of the insects. Practicable means of 
carrying out all these preventive measures must be devised
-P-A-G-E-133
  
JUDGMENT AND REASONING 107 
and put into execution. All this is entirely aside from the 
methods of curing the disease when contracted. 
The steps of deduction. The most formal deductive reason- 
ing proceeds by the rather cumbersome triangular combina- 
tions of judgments known as syllogisms. The first paragraph 
of this chapter contains an illustration of this sort of reason- 
ing. The student will readily recognize that this is the usual 
type of reasoning followed in our high-school geometry. 
Each syllogism involves a major premise, which is a generali- 
zation already agreed upon and which is sufficiently broad 
to include the particular case under consideration. Then 
there must be a minor premise, which is the definite asser- 
tion that the particular case being considered is one of the 
kind of things about which the major premise makes its 
assertion. This connects the two judgments so that the third 
step, or conclusion, merely applies to the particular instance 
the formal assertion included in the general truth. In formal 
geometry we start out with a few generalizations so broad 
and so simple as to be questioned by nobody; such as, “The 
whole is equal to the sum of the parts,” “Things equal to 
the same thing are equal to each other.” Such broad state- 
ments, assumed to be self-evident and hence to need no proof, 
are known as axioms. These axiomatic generalizations are 
used as major premises for reaching conclusions about lines 
and angles. These conclusions are used for reaching still 
others. Thus the entire deductive science is built up. If the 
axioms are sound, and there is no false step in the reasoning, 
every conclusion will be absolutely sound. The definite 
steps, then, of deduction are (1) Getting the problem in mind. 
This is essential in reasoning of every kind. (2) Searching 
our knowledge for the generalization which can be utilized 
in solving the problem. (3) The inference, that is, the bring- 
ing of the general statement to bear upon the case in hand. 
(4) Formulating or stating the conclusion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
    118 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
Deduction practically applied. In eradication of malaria 
we might proceed about as follows—(1) Problem: to prevent 
malaria. (2) Necessary knowledge: mosquitoes are the only 
known cause of malaria. (3) Inference: if we eradicate the 
mosquitoes we will prevent malaria. (4) Therefore we must 
eradicate the mosquitoes. Again (4) becomes (1), our new 
problem. (2) Available knowledge: mosquitoes breed only in 
stagnant water. (3) If there is no stagnant water accessible, 
there will be no more mosquitoes. (4) Therefore we must 
remove all stagnant water. And so the process goes on for 
each practical question in turn. Usually, to be sure, we do 
not have to go through the details of this elaborate process. 
Our minds are quite capable of “jumping” from the knowl- 
edge we have to the application of it. Nor is this as danger- 
ous a practice as is the forming of our generalizations too 
hastily; for a deductive “jump” ordinarily affects only the 
special case in hand, and this is soon tested by the way it 
actually works out, while “jumping” to an inductive gener- 
alization affects all the reasoning and applications involved 
in its later use, and it may then be impossible to locate the 
defect in our reasoning when applications fail to work out 
in practice. The proof or precise steps in deductive thinking 
are valuable mainly for retracing and checking up our 
thought and for demonstrating its soundness to ourselves 
or to others. : 
Heroes and victories of thinking. The World War saw no 
more sublime acts of heroism than were done in 1900 by 
Walter Reed and his associates, who volunteered and gave 
their lives to test the theory that yellow fever is caused only 
by the bites of mosquitoes of the genus Stegomyia which 
have previously bitten persons suffering from the disease. The 
victorious wars against disease have been wars of inductive 
and deductive thinking. All great discoveries and inventions 
have been of this sort. These great constructive struggles for

human welfare have had their romances and their thrills no 
less than have the destructive wars among nations, which 
have nearly always been due to the yielding to instinctive 
impulses without the guidance of broad, constructive thought. 
The pessimistic prophecy that “wars will never cease while 
human nature remains what it is” is merely a prophecy that 
thought will never overcome impulse in solving social and 
political problems. To hope for “peace on earth” is to hope 
that wise thought and sound principles will become stronger 
than primitive impulse in determining the actions of men in 
high places. What is true of nations is equally true of social 
and industrial classes and of individuals.

CHAPTER IX 
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 
What is truth? There was nothing original in Pilate’s 
famous question, “What is truth?” It had been asked count- 
less times before, and philosophers had been trying for ages 
to answer it. It is still being asked, and the answer is not yet. 
Perhaps it is unanswerable. Many philosophers today be- 
lieve that truth is no fixed thing which we can reach and 
encompass, and then pass on, leaving it behind us; but that 
it is a guiding star leading us forward, but always keeping 
ahead. They believe that truth is not a stopping-place which 
we may hope sometime to reach, but a direction in which we 
can move endlessly onward and upward. Logic, whose busi- 
ness it is to give us the standards of truth and error in our 
thinking, helps us to keep our bearings and to keep our think- 
ing consistent at least with itself, step by step, but it sheds no 
light on anything outside the mind itself and does not recog- 
nize all the factors within it. In this chapter, then, we shall 
not attempt to answer Pilate’s question nor to bring down 
truth and dissect it; but we shall seek to point out some of 
the reasons why we believe some things and do not believe 
others, why some things appear to be certain and others are 
doubtful, what makes the various degrees of certainty and of 
doubt and of probability, and to put ourselves on our guard 
against ascribing to the thing we are thinking about the 
doubts or certainties which are due wholly to ourselves. 
Belief. First, let us examine into the nature of belief. 
What is this belief which we so readily extend to some 
things and refuse to others? What are the conditions which 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  122 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
determine the placing of it? Why do you believe that chemi- 
cal elements are composed of atoms, which no one has ever 
claimed to have seen, while you refuse to believe in ghosts, 
which countless honest people testify to having seen? Ob- 
viously because the one accords with other knowledge and 
accepted principles, while the other conflicts with them all; 
because we can understand the one but not the other. The 
atomic theory fits into and agrees with all known and ob- 
served facts about substances (and that is all we do know 
of it), while the idea of ghosts is contrary to all our well- 
established facts and generalizations. Sometimes, however, 
one perceives something which he apperceives as a ghost 
so vividly that he finds himself believing in them, reasonable 
or unreasonable. We believe many things despite our utter 
inability to understand them, because the evidence is so 
abundant and undisputed; such as that an oak tree grows 
from an acorn or that a hen can lay an egg. We believe the 
statements of some people because of our confidence in 
those who make the statements, while we refuse to believe 
the statements of others unless we can understand or accept 
them for other reasons. We believe some things, such as the 
Biblical miracles, without any understanding and despite 
the fact that the evidence is limited and has often been 
called into question, because our confidence in the character 
of the evidence is greater than our confidence in either our 
own understanding or in those who have questioned the evi- 
dence. In general we believe the statements of those we 
admire, are interested in, or feel friendly toward rather than 
the statements of strangers, enemies, and those whom we dis- 
approve. This is often true, quite independently of any pre- 
sumably greater reliability, and is due to our attitude toward 
the one who makes the statement. We believe good news 
rather than ill, because it is more agreeable to us to do so. 
We believe that which we are expecting and striving for
-P-A-G-E-139
  KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 123 
rather than the unexpected and undesired, because it is 
easier and pleasanter to adjust our thinking to the former. 
Another may, for similar reasons of his own, quite as readily 
believe the contrary in each case. In times of rejoicing we 
are ready to believe any good news and in times of despond- 
ency we are only too prone to believe the evil. Today we 
may believe in dreams as prophetic of coming events, be- 
cause we have been accustomed to hear them spoken of as 
such and because we have never done any thinking on the 
subject which would tend to upset such faith; tomorrow we 
may hear a psychological discussion of dreams, and our 
belief in their prophetic potency be utterly shattered. To- 
morrow night we may dream of some definite event, and the 
next day our faith in dreams be fully restored by learning 
that the event has actually taken place. All of which tends to 
emphasize the important fact that belief is a condition which 
exists in our minds and not in the inherent nature of the 
thing which we believe or disbelieve. One may tell that 
which he knows to be a falsehood, and by many repetitions 
actually come to believe it himself. Brain pathways may be 
as deeply and firmly established by repeatedly thinking and 
giving expression to that which is false as by knowing that it 
is true. Belief, then, is a sort of feeling of fitness, congruency, 
or agreeableness with which we receive or retain certain 
ideas, and it arises from their harmony with our system of 
thinking, from the satisfaction of our inclinations, or simply 
from habit. 
Function of belief. The practical importance of belief is 
that the things we believe are the ones upon which we base 
our thought and actions. Whatever we may say about 
believing a statement, we do not believe it if we act as 
though it were not so. We do not really believe a friend’s 
statement so long as we require other evidence to support it. 
It may be his honesty or his judgment that we doubt, but we
-P-A-G-E-140
  124 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
do not believe the statement. Belief is that attitude of one’s 
mind toward an idea which makes it acceptable as a basis of 
action. Once an idea is accepted and acted upon, however 
hesitatingly at first, by use it grows in vividness and power 
to influence thought and action. Except in those matters 
where the facts are too plain to be ignored, one may, by 
merely refusing to entertain evidence to the contrary, accord 
his belief to any idea he may choose. By the same token one 
may, by constantly entertaining doubts of an idea and re- 
fusing to act as though it were true, render himself incapable 
of believing it. Thus practical belief and doubt are largely 
matters of our own choice and determination. Although our 
beliefs may be settled by our deliberate choice, they are more 
commonly determined by the countless influences and sug- 
gestions which come to us from parents, teachers, and asso- 
ciates. We are more likely to drift into them unawares than 
deliberately to choose them for ourselves. Normally, how- 
ever, beliefs are founded upon knowledge, and this is ac- 
quired in the course of one’s education and experience. It is 
our next purpose to examine some of the degrees of prob- 
ability and of certainty, by virtue of which knowledge is 
worthy of belief. 
Judgments of slight probability. In discussing the nature 
of induction in the preceding chapter we noted that the in- 
stinctive, primitive tendency is to associate together any 
ideas which have been experienced together and to extend 
this association to other instances which we have not experi- 
enced. This tendency is more primitive even than language 
or coherent thought. A dog that has been whipped associates 
the pain with the whip and will run and howl thereafter at 
the sight of the whip. Some of the early explorers treated the 
Indians cruelly, from which some Indians judged that all 
white men were their mortal enemies and acted accordingly. 
Many of the white men judged the Indians in the same
-P-A-G-E-141
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 125 
hasty, primitive manner. A tourist considers himself cheated 
in some purchase and reports that the merchants of the town 
are thieves. One has read “The Merchant of Venice” and 
thereafter thinks of all Jews as Shylocks. Obviously a gen- 
eralization based upon nothing but a single instance, how- 
ever vivid that one may have been, is not sufficiently well 
established to be worthy of belief. Even the single instance, 
if we have not observed it ourselves, must establish its claim 
to our confidence either by its inherent probability and ac- 
cordance with known facts and principles or else by the 
established reliability of the testimony. 
Of known facts. Ifa generalization may not safely be be- 
lieved on the strength of one instance, how many instances 
shall we regard as necessary to establish it? How many 
times must we observe a definite fact to be true before we 
may positively assert that it is always true? Let us take a 
few cases for examination. “The kings of France were 
wicked men.” “Imported cloth is better than American.” 
“Western cities grow more rapidly than those of the East.” 
“Millionaires make their money by oppressing the poor.” 
Numerous cases may be found to bear out each of these state- 
ments. It may be that we do not know of a single exception 
to offset the many instances that support them. But so long 
as there remains a single case that we have not examined, 
the general statement cannot be truthfully made. We may 
qualify the general statement with “some,” “a few,” “cer- 
tain,” “all,” “so far as known,” or other appropriate limiting 
term, but so long as we are generalizing merely from the 
facts we must generalize.no farther than the facts. If, in 
addition to the facts, we should discover some reason why 
such a statement must be true, then the probability rests 
upon the causal connection and is entirely independent of 
the number of supporting instances. For each of the state- 
ments just given, there may be found reasons why they 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  
  126 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
might be true, perhaps why they often or even usually are 
true, but these reasons do not add to the reliability of the 
statements as they stand, for there are also reasons why they 
might not be true in some cases. 
Mere chance. Much folly results from trying to judge of 
future events by past occurrences or by circumstances which 
have no relation to them. The superstitions regarding the 
number thirteen, or undertakings begun on Friday, or judg- 
ing character and telling fortunes by the day or month of one’s 
birth are groundless generalizations of this sort. The state- 
ment “The great presidents have no middle name” might be 
satisfactorily substantiated by the examination of every case 
that has occurred. Yet, however often it may have been true 
in the past without exception, this would have no possible 
bearing on the probabilities of the future. Past coincidences 
have no relation to future probabilities. It is sometimes 
assumed that if there is no causal relation between two 
occurrences, the chance that they will fall together again is 
lessened each time that they do so. It is calculated mathe- 
matically that the chance that four aces will fall together in 
one hand is only one in many thousand; but if the chance of 
their doing so is mathematically established at, say, one in 
ten thousand, the fact that it has failed to occur in 9999 
successive instances is no indication whatever that it.will fall 
the next time, any more than the fact that it has just oc- 
curred once is any indication that it will not occur again 
immediately. Calculations have no control over the cards. 
The only true generalization about a matter of chance is 
that it may or may not occur. 
Practical probability. That four aces will not fall in one 
hand, that Christmas will be cold, that the Fourth of July 
will be warm, that there will be enough rain and enough sun- 
shine to make a crop of corn next summer, that industry and 
character will win their due reward, are statements of prob-
-P-A-G-E-143
Eta a ts ee ee ee were we eee ey ee Ty ee ee Ser, Oe ee epee 
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 127 
ability so strong as to justify our acting in accordance with 
them. Yet there have been exceptions to every one of them. 
There is neither certainty nor evidence of any sort that the 
next case may not be another exception. But if we refuse to 
act upon such probabilities we shall be unable to act at all. 
There is a chance that our bank may fail.next week and all 
our savings be lost, that our home may be destroyed by fire, 
that fatal illness or accident may overtake us and all the 
labor of our education be in vain. But the probabilities are 
very slight. By due care and foresight we reduce the prob- 
ability still further. All the business of life, and life itself, 
rests upon these practical probabilities. 
Practical certainty. A classic example of deductive reason- 
ing—as old as the wise Greek under discussion—is as fol- 
lows: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore 
Socrates will die. Practically this is absolutely sound; but, 
theoretically, are all men mortal? Waiving traditions of the 
supernatural (such as Elijah and the Wandering Jew), how 
do we know that absolutely all men are mortal? We know 
it only because all men have died. But this is not true of 
any men now living or to live hereafter. It certainly was 
not true before Socrates himself died, and after his death 
took place the syllogism would be of no use in proving his 
mortality. Thus we see that the certainty of general state- 
ments of this kind, which we use to prove particular cases, 
depends upon the very cases which we are attempting to 
prove. We feel entirely safe in assuming the reliability of 
the law of gravity. We assert without hesitation that any ob- 
ject left without support will fall to the ground. We person- 
ally have observed millions of instances, and of the countless 
billions of instances known to have occurred no exception 
has ever been recorded. But does even this overwhelming 
evidence give us absolute certainty that, beginning at six 
o'clock tomorrow morning, this law of gravity may not go on 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  128 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
strike and refuse to function? We shall not lose any sleep 
over the probabilities in the case, but so far as actual knowl- 
edge is concerned does any number of cases which have oc- 
curred give us any knowledge of those which have not? 
Common sense and the unknowable. We may push our 
questioning of certainty still further. Do you know whether 
toothache feels the same way to a Frenchman that it does 
to an Irishman? Does yellow look the same way to a China- 
man that it does to you? Does a dog distinguish colors? If 
so, do the red light waves give him the same experience that 
the green rays give you, and vice versa? Is the flavor of 
orange the same thing in my consciousness that it is in 
yours? Is there any way that we can know these things? 
All that J can possibly know about orange flavor is the sense 
experience that J get. All that you can know is your experi- 
ence. All that I can know of the color of the orange is the 
experience I have—my own sensation process. I can know 
nothing of the shape of it or of the feel of it, of the odor of 
it, or anything else about it, except the sense experiences I 
get and the combination of these into my percept of it. All 
that I can know about any object is simply the experiences 
I have. I have an idea of how they originate in the objects 
and come to me through the several sense organs, but even 
that idea is only my mental process or experience. I think 
I have some knowledge about the physical properties of 
things I come in contact with, but that knowledge, as well 
as the thought that I have it, is only a part of my conscious 
processes. Since I can have no knowledge but mental experi- 
ences, how can I know that there is any reality beyond these? 
How can I know that my orange, my chair, my table, my 
dog, my house, my world, are anything besides the experi- 
ences that I am having? Some philosophers have maintained 
that these ideas are the only reality there is; that there is no 
world but the world of ideas, and that if there were we could
-P-A-G-E-145
    
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 129 
not know it—which amounts to the same thing. This philos- 
ophy of “idealism” cannot be disproved—for the same reason 
that it cannot be proved—simply because we cannot get out- 
side of our ideas to the physical realities which the common- 
sense view assumes to be the origin and cause of them. Our 
inability to prove the actuality of physical things by means 
of our ideas of them merely shows the limits of our capacity 
to prove. It does not at all upset the stability of the physical 
universe, any more than our questioning of the law of gravity 
interferes with the even tenor of things in their tendency to 
fall to the earth. Certainly we shall continue to act as though 
things are as they appear to be. As Carlyle remarked to a 
young man who said he had concluded to accept the physical 
world as a reality, ““Egad, you’d better.” We shall continue 
to believe it real and shall have not the slightest doubt but 
that it is. But we have discovered that there are many things 
in reality and in probability that it is beyond our power to 
prove or to know positively. 
Testimony. Any given individual has personally observed 
an extremely small proportion of the infinite number of in- , 
stances upon which any law of science is based. If I have 
observed only a few million instances of the law of gravity of 
the countless billions of billions of cases known to have 
occurred, what right have I to reach any conclusion upon the 
subject? Why should one have implicit confidence in a 
scientific general statement when he has witnessed but one or 
very few instances? Well, we have known of no conflicting 
instances, we have the habit of believing in the uniformity 
of nature in such matters, and the statements harmonize 
entirely with all our other knowledge and accepted prin- 
ciples, but we believe primarily because of the testimony of 
countless competent witnesses. We do not know with abso- 
lute certainty that their testimony is true; but so long as 
the witnesses are unanimous and in harmony with our other
-P-A-G-E-146
  130 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
beliefs, the probability is so overwhelming that no reasonable 
person can doubt it. Our knowledge of recorded facts is 
accepted as true in just the degree that we assume the reports 
to be reliable. That universally accepted reports may some- 
times be wrong is evidenced by the ancient belief in demons, 
centaurs, and other impossible monsters, in a flat earth and 
moving sun, in witchcraft, magic, charms, and potions. Many 
absurd beliefs are but just passing away, and some of those 
now accepted without question are doubtless destined to pass 
the way of ghosts, monsters, and astrology. And when these 
have been displaced there will be yet others to pass into the 
discard, and many that are now being heralded as new and 
scientific truths may sometime be cast aside as outgrown 
superstitions. In the meantime we must go on acting upon 
the best-attested truths that we know. All history and geog- 
raphy are statements of fact more or less reliably reported 
by the original witnesses and passed down to us through a 
long line of interpreters and compilers. That these are some- 
times incorrect is to be expected from the fact of human 
fallibility and is demonstrated by the frequent contradic- 
tions and errors which are disclosed. Nevertheless the prob- 
ability of their truth is so great that, except in so far as they 
contradict established scientific principles or better-attested 
evidence, we accept them as sufficiently reliable for our 
thought and conduct. In courts of justice very elaborate pre- 
cautions are taken to secure reliable evidence and to avoid 
personal bias and prejudice in making decisions; but even 
here mistakes sometimes occur through the uncertainties of 
perception, judgment, memory, and other mental processes 
as well as through deliberate deception. In the main, how- 
ever, a well-conducted trial is the best available human 
device for getting at the facts and rendering judgment upon 
them. The stability of the state and of society is built upon 
the very high degree of probability that the findings will be
-P-A-G-E-147
  Ney 
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 131 
sound. Improvements are doubtless to be expected in the 
testing and cross-checking of testimony, and psychology is 
now contributing much to this achievement. When found 
and well tested these better methods will supersede those 
now in use. Meanwhile we recognize that the overwhelming 
majority of well-established testimony is true; fully as true 
as we in our own fallibility have any right to demand, and 
as reliable on the average as would be our judgment and 
conduct based upon it. That skeptical attitude which would 
believe no testimony for fear it might be false is parallel to 
that which would plant no crops for fear they might not grow. 
Seeing is believing. Even the most confirmed skeptics will 
usually agree to “believe their own eyes.” Our senses, nature’s 
endowment for acquiring original knowledge of the world of 
physical things, are rightly regarded as the most reliable 
source of ultimate knowledge. When all other evidence is 
doubted we feel that we must “see for ourselves.” Doubting 
Thomases must see and touch to be convinced. Yet every 
magician’s trick is evidence that we cannot believe what 
we see nor trust the evidence of our senses. So skillful have 
manufacturers become in the imitations of silks, gems, food- 
stuffs and every commodity, in the fine art of making things 
appear otherwise than as they are, that wise purchasers would 
far rather trust the label of a reliable manufacturer than the 
plainest testimony of their own senses. The study of illu- 
sions and hallucinations shows countless ways in which the 
senses are deceived. Not uncommonly we may see something 
so contrary to all our preconceptions that we feel that “it 
must be a dream,” “it cannot be real.” You have probably 
heard the story of the countryman at the circus who stood in 
amazement before a giraffe and then turned away with the 
remark, “They ain’t no sich animal.” Thus there are times 
when we do not and cannot trust our senses, yet with due 
precaution against confusion and deception we will trust
-P-A-G-E-148
  132. PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
them in preference to other evidence, at least in regard to 
physical things with which we are familiar. 
Can we believe what we do not understand? Some people, 
usually rather young and well satisfied with their own intel- 
lectual attainments, assert that they believe nothing that 
they cannot understand. Fortunately this is only an asser- 
tion; if it were rigidly borne out in their practice, these 
skeptics could accomplish almost nothing at all. Belief, we 
have seen, is the acceptance of an idea as a basis of conduct. 
Understanding, we know, is the association of an idea with 
other ideas and principles so that it is explained by them. 
By “explained” we mean, more precisely, that it is reduced 
to known principles, that accepted generalizations are de- 
ductively applied to the situation and are found in entire 
agreement. These applied generalizations in turn are estab- 
lished upon others, and thus they are traced clear back to 
axiomatic truths or to basic sense perceptions. But few of 
the most important facts of life are of this well-understood 
sort. We do not understand how the food that we eat be- 
comes bone, blood, flesh, and nervous energy. We do not 
understand why the digestive and assimilative processes se- 
lect, and the circulation carries bone-making materials to 
the bones and brain-making materials to the brain instead 
of vice versa. We do not know how or why ether waves of a 
certain length become nerve currents at the retina and these 
become the experience of redness in consciousness. We do 
not understand how any stimulation of a sense organ can 
become a sensation, nor how the sensations are so reliably’ 
synthesized to produce the percepts we have of objects, nor 
how concepts can be formed, nor why reasoning goes on, nor 
any other fundamental thing upon which our psychology is 
based. The best we can do is to describe so much of the 
process as we can witness. And this limitation is not peculiar 
to psychology and physiology. No biologist can explain
-P-A-G-E-149
    
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 133 
what life is or how it arises or why it should go on. The 
physicist can merely record, calculate, and to some extent 
redirect the forces of gravity, electricity, light, and sound, 
and tell something of their. properties. The chemist can only 
describe the way certain chemical elements do act under 
certain conditions. He cannot tell why they do so. No 
scientist can explain the basic principles upon which his 
science rests. He can only record-some facts as he has ob- 
served them, formulate these into general laws, and “ex- 
plain” other phenomena by reference to these laws which he 
has devised. When he gets to the elemental things he always 
must accept and believe. He cannot understand. All his 
‘sciences are thus built upon foundations which are in them- 
selves wholly mysterious and beyond his powers of reason. 
Every application of science in art or industry depends upon 
principles which in themselves rest upon the unknown. We 
believe in all these things without hesitation because we find 
it safe to do so, because we can build our sciences and prac- 
tical affairs upon them, and because we could not possibly 
do anything without trusting to them. It is not because we 
understand them that we believe them, but because belief is 
necessary to all rational thought and conduct. 
The supernatural. Most of us believe more or less firmly 
in miracles, although these are in direct contradiction to 
natural laws. We cannot explain them by reasoning them 
under natural laws or accepted scientific principles. Any 
fact which can be so explained is not a miracle, whatever else 
it may be. Any natural explanation of a miracle is merely a 
denial of its miraculous character. How, then, can we believe 
in them? We can ascribe them to a power which we believe 
to be independent of and superior to natural law, hence 
beyond our ability to explain. To believe that miracles have 
occurred, then, implies that one accepts as basis of his 
thought events which he is unable to account for by natural
-P-A-G-E-150
  134 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
laws. To deny that they could occur is to assume that our 
knowledge and reasoning power are absolutely supreme, that 
nothing can happen or exist which our minds cannot analyze 
into our accepted principles. This assumption certainly can- 
not be sound. The very term “supernatural” waives all 
possibility of analysis into natural laws. Miracles, then, can 
neither be proved nor disproved. They, too, must be ac- 
cepted or rejected on practical grounds. Faith is that atti- 
tude of mind which accepts and believes things which it 
cannot prove. We have seen that such faith rests upon testi- 
mony, on congruency with our thinking, on the satisfaction 
which it affords, on the values it contributes to life and 
thought. It may be brought about gradually by the influ- 
ences and suggestions which determine our thinking, by 
some more sudden and forceful power of suggestion, or by 
deliberate choice. One may conclude that he has not cor- 
rectly interpreted the testimony regarding the supernatural, 
that it is not essential to his thinking either to accept or to 
reject that testimony. He may deliberately decide to accept 
or to reject ; or he may decline to do either, awaiting further 
possible influences upon his choice. In any case he should 
bear in mind that the facts are presumably all in and that 
scientific principles cannot apply, and hence any change must 
be merely a change in his own attitude. 
Human limitations. The important point which we are 
seeking to impress in these paragraphs is the inevitable limi- 
tation of human thought. We move within a physical sphere 
limited by our powers of sense-perception, well knowing that 
there must be forms of energy and probably of matter of 
which we have no means of becoming directly aware. We 
live within a range of reported and observed data, well know- 
ing that an infinity of events have occurred and are now 
going on which we have no possible means of apprehending. 
We know that there are more things in heaven and earth
-P-A-G-E-151
  
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 135 
than are dreamed of in our philosophy. We think within a 
limited field and by means of limited powers, perfectly aware 
that in whatever direction we pursue our researches we sooner 
or later reach the bounds beyond which our powers do not 
carry us. Doubtless the whole history of mental develop- 
ment in the race, as well as in each individual, will be a 
pushing out farther and farther into the unknown, but always 
with the consciousness that there are depths we have not 
sounded and heights we have not scaled. Within our narrow 
limits of knowledge and reasoning power we are at liberty 
to think and to feel that our minds have the mastery. The 
limits themselves are not fixed; we have found no “thus far 
shalt thou go and no farther.” We have no fear of bounds 
guarded by demons and terrors, as did the ancient geog- 
raphers, who surrounded their known world with imaginary 
monsters and certain destruction; or the early scientists, 
whose discoveries were regarded as black magic, to be known 
only by selling one’s soul to the devil. The limits of our 
attainments are merely problems challenging and inviting us 
to further progress, and the world honors him who delves 
into the unknown and discovers laws or devises applications 
of them hitherto unknown to man. There is no danger of 
our going too far, provided only that we keep our conclusions 
soundly built upon careful observation of fact and organized 
according to the necessities of mental relations. But beyond 
the limits scientifically established no arguments are valid. 
There reasoning cannot prove nor disprove. We may accept 
or refuse to accept, knowing that no one can prove our posi- 
tion wrong. Arguments may not hope to reach conclusions, 
though discussions may be agreeable and stimulating. Prac- 
tical conduct must go far ahead of absolute knowledge. To 
believe and act only where we understand would be to stand 
paralyzed and helpless. Thinking is mostly based on belief 
and conduct wholly on faith. 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
Certainty—by definition. Is there, then, anything that we 
may know with absolute and unquestioned certainty? As- 
suredly yes. We know that two and three make five and that 
every triangle has three sides. Even though the heavens 
should fall and the dry land be swallowed up in the sea, so 
long as we think at all we shall be absolutely certain of 
these things. Why? Because the proof is in the statements 
themselves. The sum of two and three is what five means. 
A triangle means a three-sided figure. It is absolutely cer- 
tain that all acorns grow on oak trees so long as we mean by 
oak trees all sorts of trees on which acorns grow. If by equi- 
lateral triangles we mean all those whose three sides are 
equal, we may be absolutely certain that the three sides are 
equal in all possible equilateral triangles, past, present, or to 
come, actual or imaginary. This sort of certainty arises in 
the mind itself from the meanings of the terms we use. Such 
statements are said to be true by definition. 
By logical necessity. But it is also inevitably true that the 
sum of the three angles of a triangle is equal to two right 
angles. Why? Well (not to go through the familiar details 
of the proof), it is because certain vertical angles are equal, 
and certain alternate angles are equal, and certain things 
that are equal to certain other things are equal to each other. 
And why are these true? As we trace it back step by step 
we find that the proof consists in relating each judgment to 
some accepted generalization, and this to some other, until 
they ultimately rest upon those which are true by definition 
or because of some axiom. These axioms are fundamental 
statements on which all sane minds agree. But what is it 
about them which makes us agree, and how does that agree- 
ment insure their certainty? How do we know that things 
equal to the same thing are equal to each other invariably 
and always? How shall we be assured that this too may not 
go on strike tomorrow at six, and thereafter things equal
-P-A-G-E-153
  
KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF £37 
to the same thing will be unequal to each other? Why is it 
necessary that the whole shall always be equal to the sum of 
its parts and that every effect must have a cause? A mathe- 
matical principle depends for its truth solely upon itself. No 
amount of testimony or authority can add or subtract one 
iota of its validity. It may require objective illustration at 
times for a learner to grasp clearly what the principle means, 
but so long as you can have the slightest doubt of its eternal 
truth you have not fully grasped it. The certainty and neces- 
sity of such truths is in the mind itself. It is the way we 
think them. We cannot think them otherwise. This very 
necessity is another limitation on human thinking. You can- 
not think that the whole of a thing is less than a part of it, 
that the product of five fours ever has been or ever will be 
any different from what it is now. We may not be able to 
measure or count things in the physical world to make them 
come out according to these axioms, but of their truth and 
permanence we can have no doubt. We may be deceived as 
to which of a thousand possible combinations of physical 
causes may have produced a given effect, but no rational 
mind can think of an effect as having come into existence 
utterly without any cause. This principle is of great practi- 
cal importance to students of mathematics and logic. No 
answer in the back of a book, no authority of author or 
teacher, no testing out by physical measures, can make a 
mathematical principle more or less true. Once it is clearly 
grasped, it is its own unassailable authority; and until it is 
absolutely self-evident, to the point that no challenging or 
contradiction can shake one’s assurance of certainty, the 
truth has not been mastered. The conscientious student will 
accept no evidence or authority of a mathematical truth 
except the clear certainty of his own thinking. 
Certainty is not applied. The things of certainty, then, 
are the things of the mind acting by itself. Whatever in-
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 PSYCHOLOGY AN D SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
volves our knowledge of the world about us or of our ability 
to deal with it involves more or less of probability. Our 
mathematical and logical principles are either right or 
wrong; we know them to be absolutely correct and neces- 
sarily true, or we do not know them. There is no question of 
probability; no contingencies can change them one iota so 
long as they remain purely mental processes. As soon as we 
attempt to apply them in the material world, they are sub- 
ject to all the degrees of uncertainty that inhere in our knowl- 
edge of material things. We may calculate positively the 
load that a bridge span will carry, but whether or not it will 
give way under that strain depends upon whether the iron 
used in its construction happens to have the same tensile 
strength as that from which the tables used in our calcula- 
tions were compiled. Five and three is undoubtedly eight, 
but if we add three chickens to our flock of five we shall not 
have eight if some of them die. The interest on $1,000,000 
for a year at 6 per cent is certainly $60,000—unless the bor- 
rower fails to pay it, or the bank breaks, or the securities 
burn up, or the government takes part of it in taxes, or any 
of a hundred other mishaps which might occur. However 
satisfied we may be about the certainty of any of our knowl- 
edge, what we can do with it in the material world is still a 
matter of probability—and of faith. 
The certainty of the unknown. Chief among the things 
that our minds must recognize as necessarily true is their 
own limitation. Mathematics encounters infinity on every 
hand in its calculations—in numbers, positive and negative, 
known and unknown; in forms; in space; in time. Logic 
knows that necessity and cause are the very foundations of 
pure thought, but whence they come, or why or how, it cannot 
answer. In the field of the knowledge of material things, of 
the world of substance and probability, we have already felt 
the mysterious immensity of the unknown and the unknow-
-P-A-G-E-155
  KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF 139 
able, which we encounter in every direction when we push 
out to the limits of our mental tether. Wherever we turn we 
are confronted with limits. We are shut in a field,—vast and 
beautiful, to be sure,—and as far as we have been able to go 
in any direction we have glimpses of a reality beyond. We 
know what we mean by finite: it is our field. Infinite means 
the vastness beyond the limits of our comprehension. It 
does not mean “having no end” in that tantalizing way in 
which we sometimes try to picture infinite space in our finite 
minds—distance going on to the end that we can think, 
and then on and on to the end of this endless distance, and 
then— We cannot define or picture infinity of any sort in 
a finite mind. In every way infinity means that which is 
beyond our power to know. There is necessity for a cause 
back of any cause that we can define, a time before and after 
any that we can know, a space beyond any that we can think, 
a certainty beyond all the probabilities we have been dis- 
cussing, a power incomprehensible to us which makes it 
possible for us to know the world and for all the processes 
of the mind and of the body and of life to go on. There is 
reality outside of and beyond this limited scope of our per- 
sonal existence. Is there not wisdom beyond ours, justice 
that we have not attained, goodness that none of us have 
achieved, a pure love for humankind that no one of us 
human creatures has realized? There is some reason for our 
very existence and for all the marvels of that existence—a 
»reason utterly beyond our grasp and before which one must 
surely stand in awe and wonder. To deny any such reality 
is simply to assert that our own mind encompasses all there 
is of reality. If we are finite, there is infinity all about us. 
If to this infinity we ascribe the name God, then God is as 
necessary to rational thinking as is any mathematical truth. 
Certainty is theoretical; probability is practical. This is 
no place for a discussion of that ever-interesting question of
-P-A-G-E-156
140 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
the nature and attributes of Deity. But this much we may 
say further. So long as we assert the reality of God, of in- 
finite Being as indicated in the last paragraph, and so long 
as we infer his nature from what we mean by that term,— 
the infinite and unknowable which meets us on every hand, 
—our knowledge is in the realm of the necessarily true. As 
soon as we assert anything of him derived through sense 
perception or through testimony, we enter the realm of prob- 
ability. We may consider the degrees of probability ; we may 
consider that testimony is often more reliable than judg- 
ment; we may consider that it is wiser to accept probability 
and act upon it than to wait for a certainty which we are not 
capable of receiving. We may conclude that the soundness 
of belief is determined by its practical results in life and 
history rather than by its logical coherence. We may decide 
that it is nobler to live and die in a belief that we cannot 
prove than to miss joys and values in life because of a doubt 
that we cannot dispel. We may regard practical faith as 
more reliable and more worth while than speculative cer- 
tainty.. Whatever may be one’s religious opinions, this is 
sure, that knowledge in the realm of certainty gives only 
philosophy, theology, and argument, but faith in the realm 
of probability leads to practical things. The field of certainty 
is very limited in scope and yet more limited in practical 
values ; the field of probability is the great field of practical 
action in which we live and move and have our being. If 
truth is that which works out in practice, as modern philos- 
ophy asserts, then probability has much more of truth in it 
than has certainty.

  CHAPTER X 
STRAIGHT THINKING AND ACCURATE STATEMENT 
Theory and practice. What we have learned as to the 
forms and validity of reasoning is hardly worth the learning 
unless we can put it into use in our reading and study,-in our 
thinking and writing and speaking. Let us, now, in a practi- 
cal and untéchnical manner, examine some of the more dan- 
gerous errors of thought and statement, to the end that we 
may be better able to think straight and reach sound conclu- 
sions and, when we speak, to say just what we mean. If we 
would be clear thinkers, we must form a critical habit which 
will make us skillful in detecting flaws in the statements 
of others. Both clear thinking and plain honesty demand 
that we apply the most rigid tests of accuracy to our own 
statements. 
Verifying the facts. Our first precaution should be to 
verify the facts upon which a statement is based. If these 
can be reéxamined or supported by several unbiased wit- 
nesses, it is a simple matter to establish them. Not uncom- 
monly, however, perfectly sincere witnesses take oath to 
quite contrary statements of fact. In a certain football game 
the umpire and a large number of spectators were positive 
that a player who made a long run for a touchdown had 
stepped over the side line. The referee and an equal number 
of spectators were sure that he had missed it by at least a 
foot. Presumably all the witnesses were honest, and yet it 
appeared that they were divided almost exactly in accord- 
ance with the interests of the college they favored. What 
142
-P-A-G-E-159
  ACCURACY 143 
each saw was apperceived to what he expected and desired. 
As it is commonly expressed, we usually see what we are 
looking for. A witness in a murder trial testified that he had 
seen the accused fire the fatal shot. On cross-examination 
he freely testified that he saw only the shoulder and arm of 
the shooter and that he knew of no identifying marks by 
which he could be sure they were the shoulder and arm of the 
accused. He perceived the arm, but he apperceived the owner 
of it. Frequently court trials and almost any baseball game 
furnish instances showing how difficult it is to distinguish 
clearly between that which is actually seen with the eyes or 
heard with the ears and that which is supplemented by the 
activity of the mind. In the case of generalizations any well- 
established idea tends to associate with itself every instance 
which actually or apparently bears it out, and thus to vivify 
the particular case and strengthen the general idea, while 
other instances which contradict the latter are not apper- 
ceived to it at all. For example, one gets the idea through 
some joke that college professor: bsent-minded ; there- 
after every professor of that Sort goes to prove the state- 
ment, while those who are not of that class are simply not 
thought of in that connection. 
Generalizing too far. The primitive tendency to extend 
our conclusions from a few known facts to the many that are 
unknown, we have already found to be a common sin against 
sound thinking. It is easy to say “These apples are all 
rotten,” when perhaps a third or a half are sound. “I never 
could learn mathematics” usually means “I seldom did.” 
That it is bad luck to spill salt, that to knock on wood wards 
off evil, and countless other absurd common superstitions 
are evidence of how tenacious such generalizations are, once 
they somehow get started. The use of charms to cure or 
avoid disease and much of the use of drugs for the same 
purpose have had their origin largely in this unrestrained 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
tendency of untrained minds to believe that what has oc- 
curred must occur again. Many old people still confidently 
predict the weather from the way the new moon hangs in the 
sky. This apparent shape of the moon is due to the relative 
position of the sun, earth, and moon and can be predicted by 
astronomers with mathematical accuracy as many centuries 
ahead as they choose, while we know there is no such regu- 
larity in the weather. 
Post hoc, ergo propter hoc. This Latin phrase (meaning 
“after a fact, therefore because of it””) expresses one of the 
common errors in thinking. It is the tendency to assume that 
because two things occur together one must be the cause 
of the other. It was due to such reasoning that malaria was 
so long supposed to be caused by night air. In Rostand’s 
fantasy, Chantecler is described as believing that the sun rose 
because of his crowing, since the crowing always preceded 
the rising. Some successful men in America have been un- 
schooled, from which some boys have reasoned that igno- 
rance is a means to success. In the complexities of social and 
political problems this particular type of error is prone to 
arise. A certain law is passed, and countless ills of the next 
decade are pointed out by its enemies as the results of it, 
while its advocates find an equally imposing array of happy 
effects. Prohibition and woman suffrage have each been 
credited with the other and with innumerable good and bad 
features of recent political, social, and industrial life. It is 
not safe to conclude that any two things occurring together 
are related as cause and effect unless a definite causal relation 
between them is discovered. 
Partial truths. Even where an actual causal connection 
can be discovered, it is often quite incorrect to regard the 
one thing as the cause of the other. Rain may have a definite 
relation to a good crop of corn, but to overlook the quality of 
the seed, the cultivation, the time of planting, the sunshine,
-P-A-G-E-161
  
ACCURAGY 145 
the kind of soil, and other coérdinate causes, and to lassert 
merely that the rain was the cause of the good crop, would 
be a serious fallacy. In the complex problems of human 
society these partial statements are often leading theorists, 
reformers, and voters astray. Individuals and parties are 
prone to seize upon a single idea and proclaim this as the 
cause or cure for all the ills of society. Generally speaking, 
it is safe to assume that no single or simple remedy can cure 
any complicated situation. Social unrest will not be cured 
by higher wages, nor by better living-conditions, nor by the 
preaching of any doctrine, nor by the teaching of any lessons, 
nor by the success of any party, nor by the passage of any 
laws, nor by the deportation of any agitators, nor by any 
other single line of action. Nor can we say with any assur- 
ance of truth that because human nature is such as it is the 
unrest can never be cured, and hence there is no use trying. 
It is practically sure that some of these remedies, perhaps all 
of them, will contribute more or less to the ultimate cure, 
but how many of these or of others that have been pro- 
posed or that have never yet been proposed will be required 
before the cure is complete, or whether a total cure is at all 
desirable, is quite another matter. Countless foods and drugs 
and systems of exercise or treatment are offered as straight 
roads to health; innumerable semipsychological schemes of 
mind-training, memory development, and will-strengthening 
are advertised to insure efficiency and success; but neither 
health of body nor power of mind are quite such simple 
affairs. It may be that the particular offering will meet’ the 
greatest need of some individual, that it will be hepful for 
every individual, but we must be on our guard against be- 
lieving that there is any single magic key or royal road to 
health, wealth, happiness, or learning. 
Prejudice. All these forms of error are due more or less 
directly to that inevitable tendency of the mind to “see what
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
we are looking for.” This is because the firmly established 
cortical pathways function in the apperceiving of new experi- 
ences, while connections as yet unformed cannot do so. 
Every accepted statement, particularly if it is satisfying 
and agreeable, annexes to itself every fragment of experience 
which can by any twist be made to support it. The same 
is true if it is the negative side of the statement that is 
accepted. Having adopted an opinion first, on either side, one 
is constantly meeting with facts to bear it out. If, now, one 
deliberately assumes that either side (or neither) may be 
the true one, each piece of evidence is first carefully exam- 
ined to see which side, if either, it supports; then the total 
evidence for each side is weighed, and opinion is reached in 
accordance with the weight of evidence. This is the mental 
attitude of a judge on the bench, and hence is a judicial atti- 
tude. It must be the attitude of each of us in so far as we 
are truth seekers and not mere partisans. The attitude of one 
who has adopted an opinion, who has “taken sides,” and 
hence is not in mental condition to weigh evidence fairly, is 
a pre-judged, pre-judicial, or prejudiced attitude. We could 
not expect a fair decision from judge or jury which has pre- 
judged the case; that is to say, is prejudiced. Either, if 
shown to be consciously or unconsciously prejudiced, is de- 
barred from serving in a trial. Jurors are required to swear 
that they have not formed an opinion in the case they are 
to try. This is not because of any doubt as to their honesty, 
but because of this instinctive psychological tendency to see 
things in accordance with an opinion already accepted. Our 
minds act in the same way outside’a jury box as inside it. 
any-sidedness of truth. It is hard for untrained minds 
to realize that nearly every question worthy of much dis- 
cussion has more than two sides. The old story of the blind 
men who went to see the elephant admirably illustrates the 
point. One of them, feeling the animal’s leg, declared the
-P-A-G-E-163
  ACCURACY 147 
elephant was like a tree trunk ; another, who came in contact 
with its side, was sure that it was like a wall; another, grasp- 
ing its trunk, declared it was like a mighty snake; another, 
getting a tusk in his hand, knew it was like a horn; while the 
last was equally certain from his experience with its tail that 
the elephant was a species of rope. The discussion among 
them afterward was full of heat and acrimony and reflections 
on the intelligence of each other. Each knew that he was 
right and hence that all the rest were wrong. If several 
people look at a house from as many different directions, each 
will get a different view, yet all views will be equally correct 
and true. Still people assume that social, religious, politi- 
cal, and other complex problems have only two sides —the 
“for” and the “against.” We are often asked if we “believe 
in” dreams, evolution, hell, tariff, the League of Nations, the 
word method, the Gary system, etc. If one answers Yes, 
he is grouped with one set of extremists; if No, he is lined 
up with the others. Any thinking person must believe in all 
these things if he is allowed to give his own interpretation of 
what they mean; he must be able also to refuse to believe in 
any of them if certain other interpretations are given, It is 
much easier to follow the primitive impulse and “take 
sides” one way or the other than to think to the heart of the 
matter and therefore to be on neither side. The center of the 
truth, as of other things, is usually somewhere between 
the two sides. Progress toward understanding is attained by 
approaching the center from many sides. Those who are on 
only one side commonly fly off at a tangent when things 
begin to move. ‘The truth-seeker keeps his mind open for 
every point of view and tries to see the whole in the light of 
each. He finds the element of truth in each side and com- 
bines these into a fuller, richer understanding of the whole. 
/~ Thinking things through. Someone has said that our con- 
clusions are the places where we get tired and quit thinking, 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
    148 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
Too often this is sadly true. Much of human error and preju- 
dice is due to reaching a decision and closing the case in our 
minds before the evidence is all in. Except where we are 
deeply interested we are likely to be mentally lazy. Genuine 
mental work of the sort which establishes vigorous new corti- 
cal paths is strenuous work, and much courage and character 
are needed to resist the temptation to let our thoughts follow 
the older, easier, and pleasanter paths. Study is essentially 
work of this strenuous sort. The successful student is one 
who has the determination to push a problem to its ultimate 
conclusion, who can suspend his judgment and persist in 
adding and weighing evidence until the decision is sure, who 
will recheck the steps of his thinking and make sure of the 
validity of each. The majority of people think but a very 
little way without the guidance and driving of a teacher. 
An English statesman recently said that most people let out 
their thinking to be done for them by others as they let out 
their washing. One of the most successful of great American 
business men said he owes his success mainly to the fact 
that when he meets with a problem in his business he never 
lets go of it until he has thought his way out to a satisfactory 
conclusion. He frequently has to think ten hours at a time on 
one point without relaxation, and then return again and again 
to the task. He ascribes his power to the fact that he thinks 
things through for his great organization, while his thousands 
of subordinates think out little details or do their routine 
tasks like machines, without thinking. All great reformers 
and the large contributors to the world’s progress are such 
because they think farther than others do. Successful inven- 
tors, writers, organizers, executives, are the thorough thinkers. 
One must submit to live a narrow life, supported by physical 
exertion and led or driven by more active minds, if he will 
not exert himself to think through his problems. Sound 
thinking must not only be straight, but it must go all the way.
-P-A-G-E-165
  ACCURACY 149 
Is language a vehicle of thought ? Serious faults in think- 
ing and statement are due to a common misconception of 
the relation between language and thought. Language is not 
infrequently spoken of as “‘a vehicle of thought,” as though 
it were some mental dump-cart into which one puts his ideas 
to haul them across space and dump them into the mind of 
another. The figure is unfortunate. A speaker does not part 
with his idea when he puts it into words, nor is the mere fact 
that another hears any assurance that it is the same idea 
which he gets. Language is rather a system of signals, like 
the wigwag signs used by the signal corps or the flags run up 
by ships at sea. A code has been adopted which gives an ar- 
bitrary significance to each'sign used. The English language 
is such a set of code signals, and the dictionary is our authori- 
tative code book. If I have a thought I wish.to communicate 
to you, I must translate it into the code words and wigwag 
these to you by sounds when I speak or by marks on paper if 
I write. I not only retain my thought but develop it tre- 
mendously by the activity involved in giving it expression. 
My words and phrases are perceived by you, and they are 
apperceived to the concepts and ideas with which they have 
formerly been associated in your mind. The associations 
thus called into activity in your cortex result in new con- 
nections. So far as this total associative activity on your 
part corresponds with mine, you experience the thought that 
I do; you “get my thought.” To the extent that your past 
experience involved in the present process is different from 
mine, and hence your concepts and word meanings are unlike 
mine, to that extent at least the thought which you get 
through my words is unlike mine. What you get from my 
words and sentences is, then, not what I put into them, but 
what you put into them. A Russian might give expression to 
precisely the same thoughts, but because his code and ours 
are different his words would “ convey” nothing tous. If I use
-P-A-G-E-166
  150 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
words with loose and inaccurate meanings, to that extent I 
cannot make you think as I wish you to; if you have only 
loose and inaccurate meanings for the words I use, to that 
extent you cannot get my thought, however well it may be 
expressed. Even though our word meanings may agree per- 
fectly, you do not get my thought except so far as you 
actively associate the various meanings together in response 
to the combination of signals which make up my sentences. 
Listening ind reading are not passive processes, but de- 
cidedly active, if they mean getting thought. 
Order and arrangement. Much of the meaning of lan- 
guage depends on the precise order and position of the 
words. Take the word “only.” What a variety of meanings 
it may give to a single sentence merely by occupying dif- 
ferent positions! Apply it, for example, to the sentence 
“John hopes to win the prize.” Put it before the sentence 
and then after each word in turn, and notice the variations in 
meaning. “Not” is another treacherous word. By changing 
its position one may slightly vary or utterly reverse the 
meaning of a sentence. The position of modifying phrases 
is often a source of confusion or absurdity: “I saw a man 
riding a horse with red trousers and a long moustache.” 
“Punctuation. In speaking, the tone of voice and the pauses 
and expression largely help to make one’s meaning clear, 
but in writing we must depend upon accuracy of wording 
and arrangement and on the use of punctuation. Students 
sometimes feel that precision in punctuation is a useless sort 
of nicety ; but commas have sometimes been worth fortunes. 
Not infrequently the meaning of a contract has hinged upon 
the position of a comma, and the decision of important suits 
at law has been determined by the presence or absence of 
that tiny mark. The story is told of a business man who 
received a telegram from an agent asking if he should pay 
a certain amount for a piece of property which he had been
-P-A-G-E-167
ACCURACY I5r 
instructed to secure. The business man replied with a tele- 
gram thus: “No. Price too high.” But punctuation is 
omitted in telegrams, so that the agent received the message 
thus: “No price too high.” A large part of the practice of 
iawyers is due to the inaccuracies or uncertainties in the 
wording or punctuation of laws and contracts. The peculiar, 
stilted language and awkward repetition of words in most 
laws, deeds, and formal contracts are due to the efforts of 
the writers to make misunderstanding impossible, but de- 
spite all these efforts such errors and ambiguities ften creep 
in. ‘While punctuation should be constantly used to make the 
meaning of a written statement perfectly certain, the ar- 
rangement of the words and phrases should, as far as pos- 
sible, make the meaning independent of the little points, 
particularly in telegrams and contracts. 
Deceptive language. In all that we read and hear we 
should remember that others are prone to the same sorts of 
inaccuracies as ourselves. We must guard against their 
errors if we would avoid being deceived. We must -fre- 
quently analyze statements to detect not only unintentional 
deception but likewise that which is intentional. In signing 
contracts, particularly, we shall do well to see if any other 
possible meaning than that which we intend could be put 
upon the statement that is prepared for our signatures. 
Shrewd crooks are annually making millions of dollars out 
of the gullible public by means of advertisements, letters, 
contracts, etc. which turn out to mean something quite dif- 
ferent in law than they appeared to at first sight. So many, 
so remarkably shrewd, and so commonly successful are the 
ways by which the public is separated from its hard-earned 
dollars for the benefit of the sharp manipulators of ambigu- 
ous language that we shall all be wise to sign nothing offered 
us by a stranger, to trust our money to nothing that he signs, 
however plausible, to put our faith in no stocks, bonds, or
-P-A-G-E-168
  152 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
promises until we have fully and frankly consulted a lawyer 
or banker in whose intelligence and character we have entire 
confidence. Their minds are trained to detect hidden mean- 
ings and treacherous constructions and to make statements 
whose meanings cannot be twisted or misconstrued. 
Exaggeration. “It’s perfectly awful,” “It’s the cutest 
thing I ever saw in my life,” “I hope to die if I didn’t,” “I'll 
never speak to you again as long as I live,” “I’m crazy about 
him,” and so on, ad infinitum, are familiar samples of girlish 
exaggeration. Since they are not intended to be taken seri- 
ously or truthfully, perhaps they should not be so consid- 
ered; but surely a long-established habit of such utterly 
irresponsible use of language must seriously affect the 
speaker’s ability to make truthful statements or to command 
language in any reliable sense. Conversational vivacity is 
undoubtedly a most charming and desirable attainment, 
but a mere reckless use of superlatives defeats that purpose, 
indicates a lack of thought as well as of words, and necessi- 
tates a constant challenge of the speaker’s reliability. No 
cheap devices of exaggeration or oft-reiterated superlatives 
can achieve brilliancy of conversation in the place of wit, 
humor, and originality of expression. 
Profanity, slang, and laziness. Aside from its shameful 
sacrilege, profanity is a sin against clear thinking and force- 
ful expression. It is a coarse, masculine substitute for the 
girlish superlatives, and indicates lack of definite ideas or 
language for their expression. It is wholly lacking in aptness 
of expression, wit, or originality. Its frequent use leaves the 
speaker with lessened power of accurate expression and 
hence decreases speech efficiency. Slang is free from the 
worst objections to profanity, and often has a precision of 
meaning, a picturesqueness of expression, a witty figurative 
force, and a freshness which give it a legitimate place in 
informal conversation. Too commonly, however, it lacks all
-P-A-G-E-169
  
ACCURACY 153 
these redeeming virtues and degenerates into a mere silly 
echoing of smart phrases long after the smartness has de- 
parted from them. Then it becomes simply another of the 
pathetic efforts to attain conversational force and vivacity 
without the wit, humor, or originality which are essential to 
that end. These forms of conversational feebleness are all 
closely akin to the lazy tendency to use “thing,” “thingum- 
bob,” “great,” “what-you-may-call-’em,” “peach,” and like 
noncommittal words for almost any and every noun or adjec- 
tive idea, instead of exercising the mind sufficiently to find 
the word which conveys the idea intended. Such a habit is 
merely a habit of mental laziness and characteristically indi- 
cates slipshod thinking. It destroys the interest, respect, and 
confidence of others in what one says and at the same time 
destroys one’s own power of truthful and precise expression. 
All these loose, ineffective habits of expression are charac- 
teristic of young people of college age, but they are serious 
handicaps which no ambitious young person can afford to 
load upon himself if he would win in the race for success. 
The first great principle of forceful speech is, ‘Let your com- 
munication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay.” Let it say exactly what 
is meant. To enrich and vivify conversation one must first 
enrich and vivify his thought. Originality of expression 
means force of ideas. Precise accuracy in expression may 
seem pedantic at first ; but it soon becomes a habit, and then, 
with growing richness of thought, it affords a gracefulness, 
readiness, and power of language that commands respect and 
admiration and contributes tremendously to success. 
News. In the daily newspapers experienced sensation- 
mongers are constantly taking advantage of the popular 
tendency to swallow without careful analysis whatever is 
stated. Reliable journals dare not knowingly publish out- 
right falsehoods, but the ingenious ways by which they can 
make the false seem true or the possible seem actual, without  
-P-A-G-E-170
    154 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
actually lying about it, pass all understanding. Sensational 
headings are the commonest deceivers and the most profit- 
able, for the headings often sell the papers. In recent years 
it was not uncommon to see in large type across a front page, 
“Villa Taken by Carranzistas,” or words of similar effect, 
followed by a modest dispatch from some Mexican or border 
town stating (quite accurately no doubt), “It is reported,” 
or “It is rumored,” or “An American citizen just arrived 
from the interior of Mexico reports that he was told by,” 
etc. Similar “news” can be found almost any day in all but 
the most conservative papers. Such reports are partic- 
ularly common in reference to what is expected to occur 
in political circles. Predictions are safer to make than 
doubtful reports of facts. The discerning reader who is 
seeking facts learns to read no farther when an item begins 
with “It is rumored,” or “reported,” or “believed,” etc. 
Gossip. In conversation the much-abused “they say” is 
the chief sinner against veracity. What “they say” natu- 
rally appeals to us as something quite generally known and 
hence to be accepted as probable, although in fact it is a 
method of asserting that for which the speaker himself is 
unwilling to accept the responsibility. It should be regarded 
as a warning that the statement to follow is extremely doubt- 
ful, for “they say” is perhaps the most prolific and unreli- 
able tale-teller that uses the English language. He (or she) 
is a cowardly and cruel gossip. It is but a step from “they 
say” to “everybody says,” and then “everybody knows,” 
and that usually justifies the next busybody who repeats the 
story in leaving off any introductory limitation whatever, 
and the rumor has become an assertion. 
The fallacy of proverbs. Proverbs and old saws are fre- 
quently used to make doubtful statements plausible. Many 
of these are notoriously false, and most of them may be 
applied in quite different and contrary meanings. They may
-P-A-G-E-171
  
ACCURACY 155 
make a statement more vivid, but they cannot add to its 
truthfulness. They should always be analyzed as to their 
inherent truthfulness and then as to their applicability to 
the matter in hand. “A bad beginning makes a good ending,” 
may be consoling to one who has made a false start, but it 
would be hard to devise a statement with less of truth in it. 
“Vox populi vox Dei” is often quoted with a ring of finality 
in behalf of political arguments. A recent writer has quite 
effectively raised the question, “Has populi a vox?” Even 
if the people collectively have any one voice, rather than a 
multitude of conflicting voices, it is ordinarily quite impos- 
sible to know which is the voice of the people and which is 
the voice of the demagogue; and, finally, as popular opinion 
is notoriously fluctuating, the proverb implies a very change- 
able and uncertain sort of deity. 
Quotations. Fragmentary quotations from high authority 
are likewise commonly used to bolster up arguments quite 
different from those the authority would accept and with a 
meaning quite unlike that of the quotation in its original 
setting. “The Devil may quote Scripture to his purpose” is 
one proverb that is often borne out by fact. The Bible may 
be quoted on opposite sides of almost every question ; so may 
Shakespeare, or Jefferson, or almost anyone else who has said 
many things on many subjects. But fragmentary expres- 
sions seldom truly express one’s whole opinion and should be 
used or accepted only with a great deal of caution. 
Illustrations. These, too, are effective means of making 
statements vivid and plausible, but in the light of intelligent 
criticism they usually add nothing whatever to the validity 
of the statement. An illustration, if it really illustrates, gives 
one case in point. Whether or not there may be others is an 
entirely different matter. It is important also to discover 
whether the illustration may not illustrate other and diverse 
assertions, whether the case necessarily bears out the state-  
-P-A-G-E-172
  156 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
ment or seems to simply because the hearer’s mind is en- 
gaged with that statement instead of some other. Certain 
industrial disturbances were cited by different people as 
illustrating, respectively, the effect of prohibition, of the 
high cost of living, of labor legislation, of Bolshevist agita- 
tion, of the suppression of the Bolshevist, of the attempt to 
pass the Peace Treaty and of the failure to pass it. 
Analogies. Analogies are even more deceptive than illus- 
trations for purposes of argument. An analogy is a supposed 
parallel, but in using it one is apt to forget that the essential 
characteristic of parallels is that they never touch each other. 
It may be a beautiful figure of speech to speak of a thought 
being a seed sown in the mind which grows up into’a sturdy 
purpose and blossoms into a beautiful deed. Such figures are 
fairly useful for making abstract things seem more tangible, 
but when one attempts to argue from them anything more 
about how the soil should be prepared or the need for sun- 
shine and moisture, etc., they simply have no meaning at all. 
It should be remembered that absolutely nothing can be 
proved by analogy; it can only illustrate and beautify a 
statement. Analogies are most commonly used in trying to 
clarify one’s thought about spiritual, abstract, and intangible 
things. They make such things seem concrete and easier to 
apprehend. But those who talk of spiritual and abstract 
things are prone to carry analogies too far. In religious 
matters, particularly, there is a tendency to insist upon some 
beautiful analogy so continuously and so extensively that 
we are in danger of thinking of the analogy as the reality. 
The argument of attack. Another defect of argument is 
to attempt to prove one’s own position by attacking the posi- 
tion of his opponent or even by attacking the opponent him- 
self. Unless it is established that one of two alternatives 
must be correct, of which I maintain one and my opponent 
the other, I do not prove anything about my position by
-P-A-G-E-173
  
ACCURACY 157 
proving my opponent to be wrong. It may be necessary to 
refute his position before I can establish mine, but the 
refutation does not prove me correct—that remains still to 
be done. Political arguments are often of this sort. The 
administration is attacked. All its shortcomings are paraded, 
and perhaps countless evils with which it had nothing what- 
ever to do are ascribed to it. All of which has frequently no 
bearing upon the practical question of whether the party 
which is trying to get in power can or will do better or even 
as well. Political demagogues will have much less power 
when people form the habit of insisting upon constructive 
argument, when the debaters are required to show what 
they can and will do rather than what the opponent has or 
has not done. 
Manner versus substance and argument. Our beliefs are 
affected not only by all these and many other kinds of decep- 
tive statements but by the very manner in which the state- 
ments are made. A positive, dogmatic, unhesitating assertion 
usually carries a convincing force that the same statement 
would lack if said modestly and with deliberation. Some 
speakers seem to rely almost exclusively upon loud and posi- 
tive assertion to convince their hearers, and many hearers are 
doubtless most easily convinced in this manner. The think- 
ing person, however, is more likely to suspect such statements 
because of the very fact that the speaker is resting his case 
upon noise rather than reason. The ability of a speaker to 
look his hearer squarely in the eye is perhaps good evidence 
at least of the speaker’s sincerity, but even this can have no 
bearing on the soundness of his judgment in matters of 
opinion. The personal attractiveness of a speaker usually 
has large weight in making his statements effective for the 
persuasion of his hearers; so have his dress, manners, bear- 
ing, and the tone of his voice, as well as the choice of lan- 
guage that he uses. Shrewd salesmen give much attention to
-P-A-G-E-174
  158 PSYCHOLQGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
these matters, well knowing that they often have far more 
to do with making their arguments conclusive than the worth 
of their goods. It is a common trick, too, of public speakers 
to appeal to the sense of humor, to play upon the sympathies 
of the audience, to tell stories funny or pathetic, with per- 
haps the vaguest forced connection with what they have to 
say—but these stories arouse an emotional response which 
the speaker utilizes to make his statements believed. All 
these are perfectly legitimate and desirable aids to making 
the truth more effective, to converting ideas into beliefs. But 
unfortunately they may be and are used as freely for making 
the untrue seem true. As speakers seeking to disseminate 
truth we shall do well to cultivate these gifts; as hearers 
seeking truth we shall do well to guard ourselves against 
them and seek to examine the soundness of the real argu- 
ment which they are used to support. 
EXERCISES 
1. How do you account for such beliefs as the following? Try to 
point out the nature of the fallacy in each. 
Colds are caused by low temperature. 
Trusts are caused by tariffs. If tariffs were abolished, there would be 
no more trusts. ae 
Trusts are the cause of the poverty and suffering of the masses. 
The crime and misery of society are due to the liquor traffic. 
Prohibition has caused a great increase of crime and drunkenness. 
If you look at a person suffering from sore eyes, you will contract the 
disease. 
™  Aehorsehair left in running water will turn into a snake. 
The left hind foot of a graveyard rabbit brings luck. 
2. Read some popular articles on local, national, or international 
politics and mark all statements which you suspect may be preju- 
diced. Indicate the grounds of your suspicion. 
8. Give an illustration of a prejudiced opinion on the part of 
some teacher or other person you have known. Can you explain the
-P-A-G-E-175
  ACCURACY 159 
prejudice? Can you find some prejudiced opinion of your own 
toward some person or question? How do you account for it? How 
can you correct it? 
4, Do you believe (1) in examinations, (2) in socialism, (3) in 
war? Just what does your belief in each mean? Under what inter- 
pretation of each would you take the opposite side ? 
5, Find illustrations of the deceptive character of news items or 
headlines in the current newspapers. 
6. The student will find a very profitable exercise in applying the 
discussions of each paragraph of this chapter to whatever he may be 
reading, hearing, or saying. It is not necessary to multiply questions 
here, but the value of the chapter will depend on the faithfulness 
of the student in applying it.

  CHAPTER XI 
MEMORY 
The problem. Cortical connections and mental associa- 
tions would be useless achievements, if they were not re- 
tained. If they disappeared like tracks made in water, not 
only intelligence but habit and instinct would be impossible. 
Without some considerable degree of permanency all the 
processes we have been studying would be in vain. Our next 
problem is to examine the manner in which the experiences 
and connections of the past are made available for the 
present and future. Where is a habit or an instinctive tend- 
ency when it is not in use? What becomes of an idea? 
How does it remain with us when it is not in mind, so that it 
may be recalled at will for service in our thinking? What 
is a thought when we are not thinking it? We do not and we 
could not think all the time about all the things that we 
know. When we turn to another idea, the one we have been 
working with seems to “go out” like the flame of a candle 
when it is extinguished. Does it cease to exist? Or where 
does it go? 
Retracing synaptic paths. Though our direct and positive 
knowledge in such matters is decidedly limited, there can be 
no doubt that the retention of all such attainments depends 
on their persistence as synaptic pathways in the nervous 
system. The idea “goes out” not like a candle, but like an 
electric light, by the turning off of the current of energy 
which caused it to shine, leaving the bulb and the connec- 
tions all ready to function as soon as the current is turned 
160
-P-A-G-E-177
  MEMORY 161 
on again. The habit machine or the instinct system of equip- 
ment go into or out of action simply by the turning on or 
off of the actuating current. The special cortical connections 
involved in seeing, smelling, and handling a rose are doubt- 
less the same (barring only the afferent, or incoming, currents 
from the sense organs) as are involved in seeing, smelling, 
and feeling it again in memory. The first process is set in 
action by the physical stimulus from the senses, and the 
other by some internal or related process that “gets on the 
line” and retraces the pathway of the former activity. 
Permanence of pathways. A good memory, then, consists 
of a large ability to retain synaptic connections and to get 
them into action when we need them. The permanency of 
neural connections per se is something over which we have 
no direct control. We have no way of getting into our brains, 
picking out the connections .we desire to have permanent, 
and treating them with any sort of preservative. It is pos- 
sible that the durability of such connections is to some 
extent a matter of inherited physical structure. Some brains 
seem to be quick to receive impressions and some very slow. 
Some are perhaps more fluid in character and some more 
dense and solid. If the one is the more easily impressed, the 
other has the advantage of greater retentiveness. If the latter 
requires more effort to get the impression established, it is 
probable that the former requires more repetitions to keep it 
there. Whatever may or may not be true as to differing na- 
tive permeability and retentiveness, it is certain that each of 
us is concerned primarily with making the best of what he 
has, and in this there is no difference of principle or procedure. 
Health and memory. The largest physiological factor in 
both receptivity and retentivity is vigorous health. Disease, 
drug effects, excessive fatigue, irritation, worry, excitement, 
strain,—these are the things which interfere with the normal 
efficiency of the nervous system. Sound and vigorous health,
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
regular habits, moderate eating, clean red blood, rest, poise, 
calm, together with fixed purpose and intense activity, are 
the conditions most favorable to power of memory as to all 
other powers dependent on an effective nerve system. 
Conditions of permanence. Further than maintaining the 
most favorable general conditions of this sort, our control 
of the permanency of neural pathways, and hence of the 
mental and physical powers dependent upon them, depends 
wholly on our method of making them. In making the con- 
nections our control is limited only by our control of the 
experiences, the thinking, the mental work and physical 
activity by which they come into being. The strength of 
one’s memory lies entirely in his memorizing. Three funda- 
mental conditions in the establishing of memory pathways 
determine their permanency and usefulness: (1) the vivid- 
ness of the original impression, (2) the frequency of its repe- 
tition, and (3) the efficiency of associations in which it is 
established. We shall discuss these in order. 
Vividness: (1) By violence. The more vigorously an ex- 
perience is recorded in the nervous system, other things be- 
ing equal, the more permanent the record it makes. An 
intense flow of energy brings about greater results in its 
pathway than a feeble flow. A violent event, like a train 
accident, a burning building, an explosion, is more likely to 
be recalled than an ordinary occurrence. The big, loud, strik- 
ing thing forces itself upon our observation and our recol- 
lection. Circus day and the Fourth of July, by their very 
vividness, stand out among the days of the year; the giant 
among men, the elephant among animals, the brilliant cardi- 
nal among birds, the shouted sentence in a quiet sermon, the 
italics, capitals, and black-face type on the pages of a book. 
(2) By primacy. But vividness of the impression may 
arise from other causes than. mere violence of the sense 
stimulation. The first day in college, the first day of a trip
-P-A-G-E-179
  MEMORY 163 
to the city or country, the first money earned, the first meet- 
ing with a now familiar friend, stand out more prominently 
and abide more durably in memory than subsequent events 
otherwise like them. This is the principle of primacy, an 
important factor of vividness. 
(3) By recency. Then, too, vividness may be due to the 
recency of the experience. Yesterday’s events are more vivid 
than otherwise similar ones of a week or a month ago, and 
these stand out better than like ones of a year ago. That 
which has but recently occurred has not yet had time to 
fade into oblivion. 
(4) By contrast. Sometimes vividness is due to the very 
slightness of the impression. A quiet day at home in the 
midst of a bustling life; a moment of absolute silence in a 
boiler factory ; a sudden hush in a crowd; the whispered or 
scarcely audible sentence which an orator introduces in the 
midst of his loud discourse,—these things are remembered 
when their much more violent surroundings are forgotten. 
You wil recall this sentence when you bave forgotten tho ftalios and chapter headings. Wividness, then, is 
rather a matter of differentness than of mere force. The 
mind readily adapts itself to violent stimuli, if long con- 
tinued, so that they become the commonplace and ordinary. 
The deafening clatter of an elevated railroad is not heard by 
those who work on or near it. Bright lights, strong smells, 
cold weather, soon go unnoticed. Were it not so we should 
continue to be unable to perceive or remember anything else 
while in their presence. Contrast becomes the key to vivid- 
ness and durability of impression. Any sort of stimulus 
becomes monotonous and ineffective if too long continued. 
Repetition. The most familiar mode of fixing ideas in 
memory is that of simple repetition. Sufficiently numerous 
repetitions of any neural process render it automatic and 
inerasable. This is exactly the principle of habit formation. 
It is the simple, primitive, unreflective mode of any learning.
-P-A-G-E-180
  
164 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
But mere dull repetition, without discretion as to emphasis 
or method, is probably the most wasteful and laborious way 
possible of committing ideas to one’s memory, requiring 
the largest expenditure of effort and time for the results in 
available remembered material. Intelligence has discovered 
means of greatly economizing in these repetitions. The fol- 
lowing principles of economy in learning by repetitions 
should be clearly understood and constantly practiced: 
(1) increasing intervals, (2) learning by wholes, (3) selec- 
tive emphasis, (4) learning by content rather than form. 
Economy by increasing intervals. The principle of in- 
creasing intervals is based on the physiological fact that the 
longer a cortical pathway has been established, the longer it 
will last without being exercised; or, stated conversely, the 
newer the pathway, the more quickly it fades into useless- 
ness unless exercised. To make sure that a particular con- 
nection will be ready for use when needed, repetitions must 
be more frequent while it is young than after it has been 
long established. Therefore to secure the greatest perma- 
nence in memory at the cost of the fewest repetitions, these 
repetitions should be arranged with the intervals of time 
between them increasing in geometrical progression. For 
example, one has memorized a quotation by means of just 
enough repetitions to be barely able to recall it without 
prompting. After an hour it will have faded to a point just 
below the ability to repeat it. If neglected for a longer time 
it will be still more difficult to recall. But if at the end of 
the hour it is relearned, with just enough repetitions to fix it 
as clearly as at the end of the first learning, several hours 
will pass before it has faded away as much as it did during 
the first hour. If at the end of this time, say six hours, it is 
again just barely relearned, it will endure as well for a day 
or two as it did for the first hour or during the six hours. 
Being once more just barely relearned, it will last as well for
-P-A-G-E-181
  MEMORY 165 
a week or two; then for some months;. and if retained for a 
year or more by this next relearning, it will probably not be 
forgotten in any reasonable length of time. If, however, all 
the repetitions required for relearning these five or six times 
had been added at the time of the original learning, it would 
have lasted but slightly longer than without them. For prac- 
tical purposes, of course, one would not expect the memory 
to fade away at any time. Instead, one would do his re- 
learning before instead of after he has forgotten the former 
learning. The practical rule is this: Instead of attempting 
all at one time to drill in a lot of dates, facts, or principles 
so that they can never be forgotten, learn them just far 
enough to be clearly able to repeat them. After a reasonable 
time, perhaps at the end of that study hour, go over them 
again until you can just repeat them clearly—perhaps once 
will be enough. At the end of a day repeat them again just to 
the same point of efficiency, and again after a week or so, 
after a month, and at the end of the term. No special impor- 
tance should be attached to the precise divisions of time just 
mentioned. There is no objection, except the waste of effort, 
to an excess of repetitions at any time. A slight excess is 
always desirable for the sake of greater surety. But no 
amount of repetition in the first hour or the first day can 
possibly make a difficult piece of learning permanent without 
the further repetitions at later times. 
Learning by wholes. Another principle of economy in 
memorizing by repetitions is that of learning by wholes 
rather than by fragmentary parts. It is the tendency of un- 
trained minds, in committing a poem to memory, for ex- 
ample, to learn each couplet or stanza separately and with 
automatic thoroughness before passing on to the next one. 
Much psychological experiment has proved this to be unwise. 
It is better to-read the whole selection over and over until 
some degree of success is attained in repeating it as a whole;
-P-A-G-E-182
  166 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
then, with special attention to and repetition of parts of 
special difficulty, continue to deal with it as a whole. This 
principle is due to the fact that fragments learned separately 
are stored in the brain as a long series of “cortical islands” 
with little or no connection between them. The power to 
recall rests not so much in the depth of separate impres- 
sions as in the coherence of the whole; not so much in 
the thoroughness of minute parts as in the effectiveness of 
the connections among them. The whole must constitute 
an integral system of connections, each fragment leading on 
unfailingly to the next. If the entire selection to be learned 
is too large to be dealt with in this manner,—a matter of 
many pages, for example,—it is best to separate it into two 
or three large natural divisions, each being a logical and 
natural whole in itself. These units should be so large and 
important that no one of them could be overlooked or its 
relations to the others confused. 
Emphasis on strategic points. A third important prin- 
ciple of economy in learning by repetitions is the value of 
constantly selecting the points of special difficulty for par- 
ticular attention and extra drill. In all kinds of learn- 
ing there is a wasteful tendency on the part of students to 
“go over and over” the lesson dully, to spread out attention 
and effort evenly over all parts of it as they come. This 
inevitably means that some parts of the task will be quite 
imperfectly done, while a great deal of time and effort is 
wasted in continuing to learn the others after they are mas- 
tered. For various reasons some portions of a particular 
task are more difficult for any particular learner than are 
others. Because they are not clear the unintelligent learner 
tends to slur over these very points while increasing the 
emphasis on those that are easier and more attractive and 
agreeable. The result is a mixture of overlearned and under- 
learned fragments. Intelligent, economical learning will con-
-P-A-G-E-183
  MEMORY 167 
sist largely in selecting the points of difficulty and in special 
drill upon these. Dead-level work is always wasteful in the 
field of learning. 
Learning by meanings. A fourth principle of economy, 
and it is inseparable from the two preceding principles, is 
that of learning by meanings instead of by words. The use- 
less waste and lifeless grind of drilling in words, words, 
words, is perhaps the saddest and most inexcusable folly of 
the student’s work. It is foolish for two reasons: first, be- 
cause so much useless energy is required to learn in this way 
and, second, because so much stuff thus learned is useless. 
The most difficult material to hold in memory is a string of 
nonsense syllables, for the simple reason that they utilize 
no cortical tracts except those involved in producing the 
sounds. Words are normally symbols of ideas. In connected 
discourse these ideas lead on from one to another in a natural 
sequence, making a connected and well-integrated whole. 
A mere string of words is like a rope of sand, with no binding 
force to hold the parts together. The more nearly a passage 
is learned as a mere sequence of words, the more difficult it is 
to establish the connections in memory; while the more 
perfectly it is learned as a unit of intelligent presentation of 
thoughts, the more easily it is retained. But because at any 
given moment it is easier to run over a series of sounds than 
it is to analyze them into their meanings, lazy minds keep on 
drilling over the sounds and postponing the vigorous anal- 
ysis. It is the same lazy and shiftless tendency that causes 
one to keep on doing a thing badly and with enormous labor 
all his life instead of stopping once for all to form a habit 
which will do it better and automatically ; or that results in 
an ignorant person’s spending his life on mechanical tasks 
which would be done better and far more easily by a machine 
if he had the energy and foresight to install it. Not only are 
the methods of such learning wasteful, but the results are
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
practically worthless. It is safe to say that nothing would be 
lost if students never memorized any lessons by words with- 
out their meanings. Always the meaning is the vital thing 
and the words incidental. Even in “memory gems,” quota- 
tions of particular beauty or force, songs, recitations, and the 
like, it is the meaning which is important. The exact words 
may be very desirable, but only as an attractive embodiment 
of the thought. Getting the words without the thought not 
only gives the student nothing of intellectual value but 
develops a habit of accepting empty symbols which is ruin- 
ous to effective study. Furthermore, the precise words of a 
quotation are more economically learned by first mastering 
the exact thought expressed by them. The words cling to 
the thought incidentally because they exactly fit it. If the 
thought has been thoroughly mastered in a passage of par- 
ticularly effective wording, very little additional effort is 
necessary to give it expression through the same identical 
form. 
Memory through associations. Besides the force of the 
original impression and the number and quality of the repe- 
titions, a large factor in the efficiency of memory is the asso- 
ciative connections with which the impressions are bound 
together with each other and with the particular things in 
company with which they are later to be recalled. This 
problem of useful associations is inseparable from those 
just discussed. 
Recognition. Not uncommonly an idea appears in mind 
as a memory of something, but such that it makes us ask, 
“Did that really occur or did I dream it?” As a thought 
fragment it is vivid enough, but somehow it does not fit in 
with other circumstances. It seems that it could not have 
happened. For practical thinking it is not enough that an 
idea should simply be in memory. We must know that it is 
a reliable reproduction of the thing it purports to be. We
-P-A-G-E-185
  MEMORY 169 
must be able to identify it, to know positively that it is not 
some contorted, exaggerated, dreamed, or imagined thing. 
This can be done only by means of the associated ideas and 
memories. To recognize a person we must not merely feel 
vaguely that we have seen the face before, but we must 
know where and when, in what environment and in whose 
presence, or what we did before and afterwards. An idea 
is fully recognized when we know the settings and cir- 
cumstances in which we knew it before. An isolated idea, 
coming one knows not whence or how, unrecognized and 
unidentified, can no more be trusted in our serious business 
of thinking than an unknown stranger could be trusted in 
our business affairs. Recognition is often largely a matter of 
feeling, a sort of comfortable “at-home-ness,” or an “old- 
shoe sense of fitness.” But this feeling of recognition, obvi- 
ously due to the ease with which nerve currents retrace 
familiar paths, is not always reliable as a basis of sound 
reasoning upon the facts given by memory. It should be 
supplemented by an examination of the actual associations 
whenever there is the slightest doubt of identity. However, 
we are not so much concerned with how to identify doubtful 
ideas as with the more practical problem of how to learn 
ideas so that they will not be doubtful. Any idea that is very 
definitely and positively committed to the memory in clear 
and forceful connection with the associated ideas with which 
it should function will be as clearly and positively recognized 
when recalled. This is the first essential of practically useful 
association connections. 
Availability. The value of memory depends upon our abil- 
ity to recall an idea when we need it. “I didn’t think of it” 
is an excuse which is used to cover a multitude of failures. 
Our afterthoughts are prone to prove much richer than our 
forethoughts or the thoughts which arise at the instant when 
they are needed. The things we think of afterwards and wish
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
we had said might as well not have been known. The fine 
stock of illustrations and anecdotes, the telling arguments 
and impressive facts, the stores of information, which give 
some men the power to think, entertain, and convince, are 
only those which are so related in the stores of memory that 
they are available for instant use in the connections in which 
they can function. Every practical capacity to deal with 
people and with situations as they arise depends upon the 
availability of one’s store of knowledge. This is wholly a 
matter of association and organization of the material re- 
quired. Unlimited inaccessible knowledge is no more valu- 
able than none at all. Hence a fundamental principle of 
effective memorizing is that each thing must be learned in the 
connections in which it is to be used. Only those things will 
be recalled together which have been associated together in 
the learning. “7 x 6” should not mean the table of 7’s, but 
should mean 42 instantly, and for it to do so it must be 
learned in just this one connection. Tenebant does not mean 
tenebam, tenebas, tenebat, etc., but means “they were hold- 
ing” and should be so learned. The rule for extracting cube 
root is not something to say, but is a way of doing something. 
It should be learned by doing, not by saying. The vital ques- 
tion in all profitable memorizing is, In what connections will 
this have its value? The task of learning it is primarily one 
of thinking it into those connections. A roadway is useful 
not primarily because of the excellence of the paving, but 
because of where it leads. The best road is waste if it is 
inaccessible and leads nowhere. So with the pathways of 
the mind. 
Mnemonic devices. Many ingenious devices are adver- 
tised for “improving the memory.” Aside from such general 
principles as we have indicated, these depend on more or less 
artificial schemes of association. These “mnemonic devices” 
are capable of infinite variation and elaboration. For ex-
-P-A-G-E-187
  
MEMORY 171 
ample, to remember some unusual name you are told to 
discover some easily remembered trait or association and es- 
tablish a connection between the name and the trait. You 
meet a Mr. Parmenter, who happens to be a stockbroker. 
You think of stocks at par, and this syllable gives you a key 
to his name. If he were a minister or judge you would asso- 
ciate the latter part of his name with his occupation as mentor. 
For remembering numbers you devise a key in which each 
digit is represented by a letter; as, for example, the phrase 
“T don’t shave,” in which J stands for 1, d for 2, 0 for 3, etc., 
to e for o. Your watch number is 8824302, represented by 
the letters aadnoed. This “word” is somehow pronounceable 
and easy to remember; or, better yet, by throwing in letters 
not belonging to the key, a phrase is constructed, “am badly 
knocked.” The date 1693 could be remembered by the word 
“misvote,” the last two letters being rejected easily because 
a date could have but four figures. Some associative relation 
would be sought between the remembered words and the 
original idea, as between the watch and the fact that it should 
not be or possibly has been badly knocked. Fantastic as this 
may seem as a memory device, some of the widely known 
systems are decidedly more so. One may readily become 
extremely skillful in devising relations based on similarity of 
sounds, on puns, on contrasts, and other wholly superficial 
and unnatural relations. It is possible by such means to 
learn long lists of names, dates, or numbers. Those who 
choose to devote much time to such exercise can give memory 
exhibitions little short of marvelous to the uninitiated. But 
for the average person a memorandum book and a twenty- 
five cent “compendium of useful facts and figures” are more 
economical. There is little more use in making the mind 
a statistical reference book than for making it a phonograph 
record. Real, meaningful relations between ideas, such as 
can be used in practical and profitable thinking, is incom-
-P-A-G-E-188
  172 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
parably the best system of mnemonics yet devised. For 
special purposes there may be occasional applications of 
these artificial devices which will prove economical. At best 
any one of them must be a scaffolding, to be utilized only 
until the permanent structure can stand alone. The sooner 
it is dispensed with, the better the mind-training. 
Learning a speech. A well-known device is the following: 
In learning an address which he is to deliver, the speaker 
thinks of himself as entering and passing through a familiar 
building. He may actually pass through the building, learn- 
ing as he goes, to make the associations the more vivid. His 
introductory sentences are associated with the steps and 
entrance; the first paragraph, with the first room to the 
right; the opening of it, with the door; and other sentences 
in order are connected in his mind with the pieces of furni- 
ture, pictures, etc. as they appear. If now each sentence is 
sufficiently well associated with its respective object, he can 
in imagination make the circuit of the building as he speaks 
and be pretty sure to find each sentence in its proper place. 
Cues or key words which will start him off on each paragraph 
are put into particularly vivid relations with the prompting 
objects. However successful such a scheme may be in practi- 
cal use, one cannot help wondering if it is fair to an audience 
to address them while one’s mind is rambling around the 
speaker’s house. Has one a right to occupy the time of his 
hearers if his words do not mean enough to himself to stay 
with him until they are spoken? How infinitely more effec- 
tive is the speaker whose ideas are so clear and forceful that 
each inevitably brings its successor. It is unfortunately and 
awkwardly true that sometimes one “has to say something” 
when it is not true that he “kas something to say.” The only 
successful way of meeting such a situation is to select an 
idea about which rich associations of meaning have already 
been stored, and going from idea to idea let each find its
-P-A-G-E-189
  MEMORY 173 
expression in the plainest words that can tell his thought. In 
other words, if you have to say something, say what you 
have. It is richness and beauty of thought that make for 
eloquence. For the learner, then, we inevitably return from 
every consideration of memory devices to the same conclu- 
sion: Learn all things through their meanings and make 
these associations of meanings as complete as possible, rami- 
fying from each important center to all useful and pertinent 
relations. 
Learning through appropriate channels. A waste of ef- 
fort in memorizing is often due to attempting to make asso- 
ciations through channels which are not used in practical 
application. Spelling is commonly learned through the eye 
and oral drill, while in use it is almost exclusively applied 
through the hand. Much greater results are secured from the 
same effort by learning through the hand in writing words 
instead of spelling them orally. That the spelling memory 
is actually located in the nerves controlling the hand is 
shown by the fact that one can often write words without 
hesitation or error when he is unable without confusion to 
tell another how to spell them. A typist’s hands know the 
keyboard of his machine perfectly, although he probably 
could not without much delay and error arrange the letters in 
the order they appear on the keyboard. Diacritical marks 
learned and recited as a list will have little or no value in 
looking up words in the dictionary until they have been 
relearned in precisely that connection. Grammatical rules, 
so long as they have been learned only as statements in the 
book, do not function at all in correcting daily speech. They 
must be learned as correct forms of utterance precisely 
through the actual process of uttering. The free use and 
quick recognition of conversational forms of French cannot 
be learned through grammar lessons and written exercises. 
They must be made familiar through actual hearing and 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  174 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
speaking. The wise student will do well to keep in mind 
always in his memorizing the sort of use he will have for 
that which he is learning, and to learn it in the connection 
and form of activity in which he will apply it. 
Practical application. A few illustrations applying the 
foregoing principles will complete our discussion of this 
topic. Unfortunately neither pronunciation nor the prin- 
ciples of word formation go far toward giving us reliable 
associative connections for remembering the spelling of 
English words. A few rules are helpful to know, but their 
exceptions are hard to remember. A knowledge of classical 
stems is valuable, if we have it, but even classical words are 
often orthographical outlaws. For rare and infrequent words 
it is perhaps wise to rely somewhat on the dictionary. It is 
much better to use a dictionary than to try to be one. But 
there are a thousand or so very common words which we dare 
not misspell and yet cannot look up every time we have need 
of them. Even though they can be spelled by rule we cannot 
afford to interrupt our thought to find and apply the rule. 
These words must be spelled instantly and automatically, 
independently of all associations, derivations, and phonic re- 
lations. They must be learned in this independent, unrelated 
way. But this skill is not attained by monotonous drilling 
through the spelling-books. The worst speller the writer has 
ever known among college students had spent more time 
drilling from spelling-books than anyone else he has ever 
known. Words should be selected for study as they are 
needed for use. Only those need special attention which give 
special difficulty. Of these, only the particular syllables and 
letters which give trouble should be given attention. These 
treacherous elements should be impressed so vividly and in 
such striking associations that they cannot be confused or 
forgotten. Troublesome words should be drilled upon as they 
are to be used; that is, through the hand. They must be
-P-A-G-E-191
  MEMORY 175 
reviewed at increasing intervals. Once learned, in accordance 
with the principles of habit formation, it is vital that a 
word shall never thereafter be misspelled. It is surprising 
how very few words, if misspelled and often used, give one’s 
writing the stamp of ignorance. Almost any student who 
knows enough English to get into college, however poor his 
spelling, could become practically perfect as a speller by dis- 
covering and permanently correcting one word a day for a 
month or two. The same principles apply to one’s grammar, 
punctuation, pronunciation, penmanship, accuracy in calcu- 
lation, methods of study, and all the arts of doing the little 
things which make the difference between failure and success 
in student life. 
Remembering names and faces. That very valuable and 
happy faculty of remembering the names and faces of people 
and other matters of interest relating to them can be devel- 
oped just as far as one is willing to put himself to the trouble 
of making vivid impressions and associations at the time of 
getting acquainted and of vigorously renewing them by repe- 
titions at increasing intervals. Leaders of men often owe 
much of their success to the popularity which comes from be- 
ing able to recall people instantly by name and to remember 
their interests and concerns. On being introduced to a 
Mr. Blank one immediately addresses him by name, uses the 
name as often as possible in the conversation, inquires if he 
is related to the Blanks of Blankville, tells of the various 
Blanks he has known, and in every practicable way im- 
presses and associates the name while impressing the face on 
his mind. He may resort to some mnemonic device, such as 
noting that the gentleman has a blank face, or the contrary. 
Meantime he is gathering data regarding Mrs. Blank and 
all the little Blanks, the town from which Blank comes, his 
business, his friends and relatives, his opinions on leading 
questions, and whatever is valuable to know about the new
-P-A-G-E-192
  176 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
acquaintance or which may serve as a channel for future 
approach. At the first convenient time one recalls the name, 
face, and related things he has learned. Later he recalls them 
again in reviewing the various persons he has met during the 
day. Day by day, week by week, he recalls and organizes the 
knowledge thus acquired. Perhaps he uses a memorandum 
book to impress and preserve the facts further. It is told of 
the celebrated politician Boss Tweed that he suffered from 
an atrociously bad memory for names until he deliberately 
decided to cure the defect by telling to his wife at the end of 
every day and every week the names, appearance, and all 
related matters regarding every person whom he had met or 
had dealings with during the day or week. A few months of 
training ‘of this sort resulted in a most remarkable develop- 
ment of the faculty for remembering people. It was an in- 
valuable power for him, and he was willing to pay the price 
of effort to attain it. 
The price of “a good memory.” There is no such thing 
as “a poor memory,” for the simple reason that there is no 
such thing as “a memory.”’ One’s memory is not an original 
power, gift, or faculty. It is precisely the sum of the effective 
brain pathways one has made by his energetic impressions 
and associations and has made permanent and available by 
vigorous renewal and organization. No one has “a good 
memory” for all sorts of things, for the reason that he has 
not been interested in giving equally vigorous attention to 
learning all things well. Many a student with “a poor mem- 
ory for dates” can recall football scores and batting averages 
with remarkable accuracy; while his professor, with a pro- 
digious fund of perfectly remembered knowledge of history, 
cannot recall the simplest errands for his wife. Any normal 
person can attain any degree of memory power in any field 
of knowledge—if he is willing to pay the price. You may 
develop a phenomenal memory for names and faces, for
-P-A-G-E-193
  MEMORY 177 
dates, for formulas, for numbers, for poems or addresses, for 
business details, for the spelling of words, for languages, for 
anything that is of sufficient importance and interest for you 
to give it the effort. All the widely advertised schemes for 
learning “show to remember and never forget” rest upon the 
principles given in this chapter. They plan detailed methods 
of applying these principles to various learning tasks and 
give exercises to make those methods habitual. Some of them 
are doubtless of much practical value for just this reason. 
What really constitutes “a good memory” is a good habit of 
committing things to memory. The essentials of this valu- 
able habit may be summed up in the three principles: 
(1) make the original impression vivid, (2) make many and 
useful associations, (3) repeat and review faithfully at ever- 
increasing intervals. Discretion must be used in selecting the 
modes and channels of impression that will make the most 
effective cortical record; in repeating, special attention must 
be given to points of difficulty ; in associating, care must be 
used to make connections which will be serviceable for ready 
recall; and all these must be made habit. This is the price of 
a good memory. Anyone can have it for the price and no one 
can have it without. 
Memorizing empty forms. Rules, definitions, and formu- 
las are the sort of things which students often attempt to 
learn by the method of drilling in words while neglecting the 
precise thought which they express. It should be clear to 
any intelligent person that it is the idea and not the words 
which are of value. Once the thought is fully mastered, the 
exact words may serve to give it more permanence and defi- 
niteness. Learned in this manner—the thought first—they 
are usually valuable in abbreviating the thinking necessary to 
apply them. But when learned as a group of words of imper- 
fectly understood import, a trifling change in the sound may 
render the whole absurd and the learner helpless. Used
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
thus they are a snare to the student and ruinous to successful 
habits of study. The boy who wrote the following definitions 
on examination would better not have learned them at all: 
“The imperative mood expresses a command or a treaty.” 
“A partisikle does not insert action or being but expresses it 
in such a way as to mollify a noun or pronoun.” He had 
gained nothing whatever of value and was prevented from 
successful study by the deplorable tendency to accept sounds 
instead of clear knowledge. In delivering a speech or recita- 
tion which has been committed to memory, if the reciter has 
first fully mastered the thought he is attempting to express 
he is able to put genuine expression into his delivery and 
can, if perchance some words should slip his memory, fill the 
gap impromptu in some way. On the other hand, the horrible 
mockery which is so often perpetrated as a “recitation,” 
in which the reciter rattles or singsongs through a long series 
of words to which he gives no expression or meaning, is 
perhaps the thing most offensive to good sense that ever 
occurs in school life. Giving true expression to interesting 
thoughts—whether in the words of the speaker or of some 
author—is valuable exercise for the speaker and attractive 
to the listeners, but nothing can well be more uninteresting 
to listeners or more harmful to habits of mind development 
than for a creature possessing a brain to attempt to turn that 
brain into a phonograph record. 
Forgetting. Our last word in this chapter on remember- 
ing is a brief one on forgetting. We have already said that 
nature has provided no directly controlled means of unlearn- 
ing. We can make connections at will through our control of 
our actions, but we cannot reverse the process. The only way 
to break a habit is never to use it. The only way to forget 
an idea is to cease to think it. But this is a hard thing to 
control. The disagreeable things we would forget come un- 
bidden to mind and stay with no welcome or urging. The
-P-A-G-E-195
  MEMORY 179 
more we seek to drive them out by force, the more they 
stick. Physiologically it is obvious that we do not close a 
pathway by keeping the energy going over it, even though 
we are wishing it would not do so. There is but one way to 
keep nerve energy out of forbidden channels; that is, to keep 
it busy in other channels. If you would not think of some 
thing, think intently of something else. Let there never be 
an exception. Whenever the unbidden idea seems about to 
present itself proceed calmly to busy yourself with things 
worth while. The devil finds works for idle brains, as well 
as hands, to do, and the only means of escaping the devil’s 
work is by being fully preoccupied otherwise. 
EXERCISES 
1. Define memory. 
2. Where and what is the knowledge you have when you are not 
thinking it ? 
8. State briefly what ‘‘a good memory” consists of. 
4, Find illustrations in your own experience of the various ways 
discussed of making original memory impressions lasting. 
5. Select some definite material which you regard as important 
for you to commit to memory effectively at this time. Write out 
plans for most successfully (1) impressing it upon your mind, 
(2) securing greatest association values, (3) fixing it permanently 
with economy of repetitions. Carry out these plans and observe the 
results. 
6. In “reciting a piece” have you ever come to an absolute 
break in memory which you could not pass without prompting ? 
To what sort of memory bonds was this due? By what kind of 
learning could such breaks be avoided? 
7. Fix in mind several names of persons or places, which you 
desire to remember, by the device of associating the name with 
some characteristic which you are not likely to forget. 
8. In trying to recall a name many people use very profitably 
the device of slowly running down the alphabet. When the correct
-P-A-G-E-196
  180 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
initial letter is reached one has the feeling that it is right, and pres- 
ently it suggests the name. Try this. 
9. To what extent can calculation and composition be taught by 
motion pictures ? swimming, by correspondence ? boxing, by lectures ? 
10. Name three sorts of things which you think you may have 
learned through wrong channels; three which you have learned 
through useless associations. 
11. For each of the lesson assignments which you have to commit 
to memory during the next week, determine definitely the associa- 
tive connections which will be of most value. 
12. On the first pages of a small memorandum book write direc- 
tions for learning to spell words by the application of the principles 
of selective study, vividness, appropriate channels, and repetitions at 
increasing intervals. Following this make a list each day of the 
words you misspell or new words which you may need. Apply the 
directions to learning these. Check off, day by day, those which you 
are sure you have learned, so that you will never misspell them. By 
means of this progressive list you can rapidly become a good speller.

CHAPTER XII 
IMAGERY 
What is imagination? The original. raw material from 
which all our mind-stuff is derived is our sense impressions. 
These are retained in memory, and the several associative 
faculties which we have studied are but modes in which the 
mind unites them in countless combinations and variously 
represents and utilizes them in concepts and abstract mean- 
ings. In much of our thinking—especially the more abstract 
sort—the original sense material has lost its identity as com- 
pletely as the bread and meat that we eat loses its identity 
when it becomes our blood and bone and flesh. We do, how- 
ever, constantly relive some of these sense experiences in 
almost precisely their original form and that, too, when the 
objects themselves are not present to give rise to the stimu- 
lations of the sense organs. Thus one “sees in his mind’s 
eye” his home, his friend’s face, or any object or experience 
he has at some former time seen with his physical eyes. In 
so far as the recognition element is present to identify it as 
a reproduction of something which has actually been experi- 
enced, the process is not different from memory. In so far 
as memory consists in these “mental pictures” or restora- 
tions of former sense experiences in the absence of the ob- 
jects which gave rise to them, it is “reproductive imagery.” 
We may, furthermore, picture to ourselves the home re- 
painted or newly furnished, the friend grown stout or thin 
or meeting us in some place where we have not seen him. 
We may change these memory pictures at will or make up 
181
-P-A-G-E-198
182 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
others which appear to be entirely new. We may picture 
ourselves going up in an airplane or traveling in strange 
lands or achieving life ambitions which are as yet but vain 
hopes. Under the study lamp on a cold midnight we may in 
our minds wander among summer meadows, smelling the 
new-mown hay, hearing the songs of the birds, and feeling 
the soft breezes on our cheeks. This interesting mental 
process of arousing sensory activities from within is known 
as imagination (from the Latin imago, a likeness, statue, or 
picture). It is a process of getting sensory experiences 
without the presence of the objects, but must not be con- 
fused with hallucination, which, we have already seen, is an 
abnormal form of perception, while imagery is entirely nor- 
mal and subject to control, and the objects do not appear 
to be present. 
Reproductive imagery. As a form of memory this repro- 
ductive imagination seems to be a more or less vivid retrac- 
ing of the brain tracts created by the original experience. It 
lacks, to be sure, the tangible sense quality of the original ; 
but it may have enough of vividness to bring with it the 
satisfaction or disagreeableness of the original, or by new 
associations it may take on meanings and emotional qualities 
which were not formerly there. Usually it affords a more 
definite basis of thought and forceful stimulus to action than 
an abstract idea does. The mind can have no greater riches 
for its enjoyment than happy memories, and the recollection 
of a kindness or an injury may affect one’s disposition and 
character for a lifetime. The difficulty we must contend 
against is the readiness with which these remembered things 
get confused with those which are only imagined. The neural 
process as well as the mental activity in the two cases are so 
nearly alike that only the most careful checking up can 
sometimes distinguish that which is supplied from other 
origins by an active imagination. Something more than hon- 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
  
IMAGERY 183 
est intention is usually necessary to secure accuracy of testi- 
mony, even of the things we have “seen with our own eyes.” 
Productive imagination. Imagery, however, is under no 
obligation to remain faithful to any original impression, 
since it does not purport to do so. It is at liberty to take 
the sense materials derived from countless different sources 
and modify and mix them without limitation. It may paint 
the home another color or substitute a mansion for a cottage; 
it may put a beard on the face of a friend or three trunks on 
an elephant seventy feet high; it can supply seven-league 
boots or a magic carpet and bring to pass as wonderful events 
as we are able to think. With this “Aladdin’s lamp” the race 
has from time immemorial built its fabled palaces and king- 
doms and peopled them with giants and fairies, gods and 
demons. It is a fascinating form of mental activity and has 
played a large and beautiful part in the life of all intellectual 
peoples. Life has few if any greater joys for a little child 
than a well-told story of fairies or hobgoblins, and any of us 
lose much of life’s innocent pleasure if we allow our absorp- 
tion in abstract thinking or the practical problems of the 
workaday world to prevent our occasionally being com- 
pletely “carried away” in the delightful imagery of a good 
story. For the average person the pleasures of the imagina- 
tion are less substantial and enduring than those of the 
actual world, but they have the advantage that they are not 
hampered by the hard facts. 
_ Limitations of imagery. Although imagination may seem 
to be absolutely unlimited in its fantastic possibilities, it is 
in fact restricted to the ideational matters which we have 
acquired through our senses and by our facility for com- 
bining these into new pictures. Imaginative people are those 
who are blessed with an unusual degree of the power of 
original combination. They are the ones who can see a thrill- 
ing story in every cloud or flower or man where their prosy
-P-A-G-E-200
  184 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
fellow mortals can see only a mass of vapor, a botanical 
specimen, or a human being. But the most wildly imagina- 
tive cannot transcend the limits of the materials they have 
experienced. The creators of the Arabian Nights tales could 
imagine rapid transit by means of a giant bird or a magic 
carpet but not by a railroad train, a steamship, or an 
airplane. They could not even dream of the marvels of radio- 
telegraphy or automobiles. They could talk of a “philoso- 
pher’s stone” which would transmute base metals into gold, 
but the wonders of modern chemistry, by which all sorts of 
crude substances are changed into desirable things which all 
their gold could not buy, were beyond their dreams. One 
who has never had the use of his eyes can by no power of 
imagination form the slightest idea of the world of color and 
light which is the inestimable blessing of the rest of us. One 
who has never heard sounds is wholly debarred from imagin- 
ing them. Unless one has actually smelled the odor of violets 
or tasted the flavor of wintergreen at some time past no 
power of imagination can give them. Imagination is always 
reproductive in that it uses previously acquired experiences, 
but it is productive in so far as it uses these elements in con- 
structing new complexes. 
Imagination types. Not only is it impossible for one to 
use in his imagination sensory elements which he has never 
received, but those which he has will naturally be used in 
proportion to their richness and vividness. Vision plays so 
preponderant a part in the lives of most of us, and visual 
impressions form so large a part of our memories, that our 
imagination is much more largely in visual images than in 
those of the other senses. The psychologists call us visiles. 
Musical people and others whose thinking and remembering 
is largely in terms of auditory sensations can hear in the 
mind’s ear music and sound “pictures” as vividly as the 
visiles can see their pictures in the mind’s eye. These
-P-A-G-E-201
  IMAGERY 185 
auditory-minded people are called audiles. A blind man who 
has developed a keenness of touch perception and has a rich 
store of memories acquired through this sense is tactile- 
minded. These differences among people are known as the 
types of imagery or of memory. The evidence is not very 
clear as to whether there are marked inherited differences in 
types, but there can be no question that these type differ- 
ences develop with the conditions of life and education. One 
who lives and works mainly through eye activity will cer- 
tainly develop vigorous visual brain tracts, while he who 
thinks mainly in sounds will store correspondingly effective 
tracts in the auditory centers, and this difference will deter- 
mine their type of remembering, thinking, and imagining. It 
is doubtless true that most persons can remember and image 
more readily in one sense than in any other one, but we 
know that the most successful method of learning any par- 
ticular thing is through as many senses as practicable. Like- 
wise to get the largest use and power of the imagination one 
should endeavor not to be confined to the contributions of a 
single sense, but to make the largest practical use of all the 
powers that are given him. 
Imagery in thinking. Psychologists have had some inter- 
esting debates on the question as to whether any thinking 
ever goes on without the accompaniment of some sort of 
imagery. Whatever the final answer may be, our interest is 
in the fact that practically all thinking is somehow made up 
of or at least illustrated by these images. We know that 
thinking is done by means of uniting concepts and that each 
of these concepts is the result of a series of sense perceptions. 
It would seem natural, therefore, that the recalling of a con- 
cept to the mind would involve the retracing of at least some 
of the sensory tracts used in its establishment. The character 
and vividness of this sensory imagery are subject to wide 
variation. If you are thinking of an accident you recently
-P-A-G-E-202
  186 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
witnessed, you see it again with what seems, perhaps, almost 
the original vividness. If you read a statement about the 
frequency of automobile accidents, you probably get a fleet- 
ing sort of picture, or perhaps a series of flashes of indefinite 
form and hazy background. Yet if you have trained yourself 
sufficiently in examining the workings of your own mind, you 
will find that each picture has certain very definite charac- 
teristics. If I say, “Yesterday I saw a man on horseback—” 
and stop there, your mind has probably seen a definite pic- 
ture. You could tell whether the horse and man in your 
mental picture were going toward or away from you; per- 
haps you could locate them exactly on some street and 
tell the color of the horse or other details which I had not 
at all indicated. If now I continue “—painted on the 
door —” your mental scenery shifts to something quite dif- 
ferent, and this again changes when I add “—of a freight 
car—” You have now located the car, perhaps in a particular 
position on a siding with which you are familiar. This again 
changes when I finish with ‘“—in a passing circus train,” and 
you can probably indicate the direction in which your mental 
circus train was going. If you are planning a vacation trip, 
you doubtless see yourself packing, purchasing a ticket, rid- 
ing on the train, setting up camp, hauling in a big fish, telling 
about it when you come back, etc. If you think of seven 
times twenty-six, you will probably see it written or printed 
and perhaps be able to indicate whether it is on a blackboard, 
paper, or book. You may see it with the multiplication sign 
or arranged with a line drawn under it ready for multiplying, 
and you may be able to indicate the place on the page or 
blackboard that it occupies. If you think some abstract idea, 
as “Peace hath its victories,” your imagery will be less defi- 
nite, but will likely take the form of the written or printed 
words. It is in the most abstract thinking only that the pic- 
turing becomes so vague and hazy as to be indistinguishable 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
IMAGERY 187 
or, as some contend, to disappear entirely. Generally speak- 
ing, at least, it is true that however broad and comprehensive 
the meaning of a concept, the picturing which accompanies it 
tends to be specific and particular, though it may be quite 
vivid or very hazy. 
Imagery in reading. When we are reading a story or de- 
scription (and we have seen from the preceding paragraph 
that the same is true in listening) our minds follow the words 
of the author by setting up the scenery and by creating and 
clothing the actors and moving them about in accordance 
with his suggestions. It is the actions, character, and per- 
sonality of these creatures of our own minds that fascinate 
us and play upon our sympathies and emotions. The richer 
and more accurate the past experience upon which we can 
draw, the more reliable and true to the original will be the 
mental staging and acting of our story. In other words, it is 
possible for us to read out of a book only what we can read 
into it. It is just because a fuller knowledge of the realities 
of life cause fairy stories and sensational novels to appear as 
a tissue of absurdities and contradictions that these lose their 
charm and interest for a mature mind. The lack of experience 
of little children enables them to put as much of reality and 
vividness in the simple doings of fairies as in the more com- 
plex and roundabout activities of the people of history or of 
the workaday world. Since the stories are too impossible to 
be confused with reality later on, and the moral teachings 
are usually sound and kindly, these stories are well worth 
while for the pleasure they give. But stories of robber bands 
and sentimental stories of love or vice have just enough of 
possibility to make them plausible to inexperienced young 
people, and from them they often get notions of the world 
and ideas of conduct that are pernicious in the extreme. In 
the reading of history, geography and science, the limit of 
the reader’s ability to acquire clear and vivid knowledge is
-P-A-G-E-204
  
188 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
usually set by the limit of his ability to call up vivid 
imagery in response to the words he is reading. The purpose 
of illustrations is to supply this sense material. Children’s 
books particularly require many pictures to insure vividness 
of imagery in the reading. In all serious reading the neces- 
sity for picturing out the matter one reads is particularly 
great ; but as this often requires a definite searching for and 
arranging of memory materials at the cost of some effort, the 
lazy reader tends to neglect this vitalizing part of the reading 
and to be content with carelessly sliding over words with 
vague and fragmentary imagery or none at all. Such reading 
is a waste of time, for its results are very slight, and every 
minute so spent tends to fix the habit and to make genuinely 
active reading more difficult. 
Imagery and action. The ultimate function of all intelli- 
gence, as we know, is to guide the actions of the creature in 
responding to situations. In the simpler forms of productive 
imagery we have the immediate connection between thought 
and action. Suppose you decide just now to open the window 
nearest you. Whatever reasoning may precede your decision 
the immediate mental stimulus consists in picturing in your 
mind the process of rising, going to the window, unfastening 
the catch, and raising it. This picturing is an incipient doing 
of the act. You not only see yourself doing it but you feel 
yourself doing it. Experiment has shown that there is an 
actual muscular tension preparatory to the more vigorous 
contraction necessary to bring it about. The thought is an 
actual beginning of the act. Ordinarily, if there is no con- 
flicting impulse or restraint, the image and the act are so 
merged into one that they are indistinguishable, and one sees 
his act actually being performed rather than as an unrealized 
possibility. But when we are planning a movement carefully 
before beginning it, the planning stands out clearly as im- 
agery of the motor process. When one learns to form a letter,
-P-A-G-E-205
  IMAGERY 189 
to manipulate a tool, to pitch a ball, to get a new stroke with 
a tennis racquet, he more or less definitely sees and feels the 
movement as a guide to performing it. In a larger way, as 
we have seen, one plans a trip by seeing himself going through 
the various parts of it. The ambitious youth visualizes him- 
self in the process of addressing and swaying the multitudes, 
leading armies, directing an industry, etc.; the artist must 
see his picture before he can paint it; the architect sees the 
building before he can draw the plans of it; the musical 
composer hears the strains of his melody before he plays it ; 
and the inventor sees his machine in each part before he can 
construct that part in metal. 
Practical imagery. Evidently this constructive imagery 
cannot be of the wild, irresponsible type which gives us 
fairy tales and the stories of Baron Munchausen. The in- 
ventor must not be content to see his completed device in 
mind, see it operating on a large scale, and see himself spend- 
ing the millions accruing from his expected royalties; he 
must check each step of the construction of his dream ma- 
chine with the laws of mechanics and the nature of the 
materials involved, and these are not controlled by his imagi- 
nation. Not only must every imagined idea be tested by 
rigorous reasoning, but it must .be tried out in physical 
fact before its worth is established. Far more activity of 
imagination was involved in inventing an electric light than 
in inventing an Aladdin’s lamp, and the difference was that 
the one was based on a wide knowledge of science and 
experiment, while the other was “only imagination.” The 
author of the victory of the Marne had no less need of imagi- 
nation than did the author of “Alice in Wonderland”; but 
the imagery of the latter was unrestrained, while that of the 
former must take into account every detail of topography, of 
supplies and ammunition, and of human factors, or he would 
have been the author of defeat instead of victory. Few if any
-P-A-G-E-206
    190 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
studies have greater need of precise imagery than geometry, 
and no profession is more dependent on this kind of thinking 
than that of constructive engineers and architects. Far- 
sighted men are essentially men of vision, and these are men 
of imagination. All forward-looking, constructive thinking 
is primarily imagination, but it is the substantial scientific 
sort of imagination which is impossible to any but a master 
of the principles and facts involved, and it is the thoroughly 
checked-up and reasoned-out sort of imagery which is im- 
possible to any but trained reasoners, who spare themselves 
no effort to think their imaginations out to a finish. 
Visions and visionaries. Imagination, then, as a mental 
power and a means of amusement is limited only by the 
range of original materials which one has acquired and 
his facility in getting them together in new and strange 
combinations. We owe much to our poets and story-tellers 
for the pleasures of the imagination through which they lead 
us. The world’s prophets and seers have been those who 
could image the future and disclose it to men. Their minds 
have been able to see visions where ordinary minds had but 
sensations. But whether these were mere wild visions or true 
prophecy depended on how far such men were masters of the 
facts of their own times and of the underlying principles of 
human progress and on how logically these were combined to 
build up the conclusions reached. Mere facility and audacity 
in putting ideas in new combinations are required to make a 
visionary, but much knowledge, insight, and clear reasoning 
are necessary for the visions by which one may foresee com- 
ing events. The men of vision have pointed out the way for 
others to go, as the architect plans the construction of a 
building. 
Daydreaming. Among the richest pleasures of mental life, 
particularly of little children, is that form of protracted 
imagery commonly known as daydreaming. Most of us
-P-A-G-E-207
  IMAGERY I9I 
know from memory or from children we have observed how 
the little minds invent playmates to their own liking. 
Friends, brothers, sisters, and parents are created in these 
dreams and remain as a continuing and very vivid part of 
the child’s mental existence for months and even years. They 
have their names and personal identity, and the child is 
frequently found talking and playing with them. These 
dream creatures afford the child company and entertainment 
in his hours of loneliness. They are always agreeable and 
subject to his will. They make almost real to the child many 
of the desires and longings which the stubborn facts of the 
world of reality deny to him. There is nothing subtle in the 
psychoanalytic philosophy that daydreams are the expression 
of some unfulfilled longing or suppressed wish. If they were 
not unfulfilled they would not be dreams; if they did not 
accord with desires they would be ipso facto disagreeable 
and hence not tolerated. The pleasure in daydreaming is the 
sole reason for the dreaming. As we grow older some of us 
have our waking hours too well filled with active realities to 
leave time or energy for these dreams. Some are so harassed 
with cares and worries that the imagery perforce follows the 
beaten paths of financial and business affairs and we are 
always thinking, as we are always talking, “shop.” Our 
ambitions and practical affairs occupy our creative imagery, 
and dreams, hedged in by knowledge and experience, become 
plans. Yet all of us to some extent, and some to a very great 
extent, still cherish this dream life, in which the ambitions, 
longings, and romances which have been denied us in real 
life are pictured out like a fascinating reality. Weeds do not 
grow in our Arcadian fields, grueling toil and bitter disap- 
pointment are no longer the price of victory, and over the 
romances are thrown no wet blankets of commandments, 
consequences, incompatibility, or grocery bills. As an amuse- 
ment much is to be said for daydreaming; but imaginings,
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
vain or sane, must make use of cortical paths and must leave 
their tracks behind to influence later thought and to affect 
the springs of conduct. The character of his secret thoughts 
determines the character of a man, “For as he thinketh in his 
heart, so is he.” Geniuses have often been great daydreamers ; 
so have worthless loafers, the hopeless incompetents, the vile 
and foul, and the dreamy youths who are easily led astray 
and preyed upon by more practical and selfish people. 
It all depends on the dreams—on their inherent purity and 
cleanliness, their worthwhileness, their reasonableness and 
common sense. Happy is he whose daydreams are such that 
he would not be ashamed to have them known; who dreams 
of unselfish achievement and noble attainment, of good to his 
community and to his fellow man; and who has the practical 
sense to keep his dreams near to the realm of the possible and 
then, by inspiring himself and others, brings them to reality. 
And happy is the community in which such dreamers dream. 
EXERCISES 
1. Read, one phrase at a time, some narrative or descriptive 
paragraph with which you are not familiar. Pause after each phrase 
to note just the mental picture you get. 
2. Imagine the appearance of the inhabitants of Mars in as fan- 
tastic form as you can. Write a description of one of them. Analyze 
this description into the original sense elements which you have com- 
bined to make it up. 
8. Recall to mind an opera you have attended. Is your reproduc- 
tive imagery dominantly visual or auditory? Recall a dinner. Is 
your imagery primarily of gustatory, olfactory, or visual experiences ? 
Which is your dominant type of imagery? Are there any of the 
senses in which you cannot image vividly ? 
4, Recall a story you have read recently. Do you “see” the 
events in memory? Do you recall them by any of the other senses? 
5. Note very carefully just what your imagery consists of in plan- 
ning a definite task. Plan a trip and similarly note the imagery. 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  
IMAGERY 193 
6. Invent some workable device for closing your window and 
turning on the heat (or lighting the fire) without getting out of 
bed (any more useful invention would serve the purpose better). 
Study carefully your use of imagery in this process. 
7. Excellent practice in literary description, as well as admirable 
study of imagery, is obtained by visualizing a scene in history, or 
one purely fictitious, and then describing the scene as accurately and 
vividly as possible. The same applies to narration. 
8. Review some of the daydreams which you can recall from your 
childhood and recent life. How would you value them as contribu- 
tions to your pleasure? How would you value them as contributions 
to your thought habits? to your permanent interests? to your 
character ?

  CHAPTER XIII 
ATTENTION 
What is attention? From our a) days in school we 
were told to pay attention or to give attention. We soon 
found that it is impossible to learn without attention. If 
our minds were wandering away from our lessons to some- 
thing of more interest, we missed what was said, read with- 
out grasping what it was we were reading, and all because 
we failed to pay attention. Our attention had a way of wan- 
dering from the tasks in hand, which was very unprofitable 
for us—but usually quite pleasant. This thing, attention, 
was forever running away, and we had to bring it back. It 
liked the things we liked and avoided those we would have 
liked to avoid, but somehow we were unable to learn things 
when it was absent. After all these years of giving it and 
paying it, of capturing it in all its wanderings and putting it 
on our work, have we yet a clear idea of what it is? When 
we examine it, it seems to be just our thought—our reason- 
ing, thinking, remembering. When we are attentive to any 
given thing, we are simply thinking about that thing; when 
we are inattentive to it, we are thinking about some other 
thing. And that is all there is of it. It is no new power of 
the mind, different from those we have been studying.| To 
give attention to a thing simply means to think about that 
instead of something else. )The mind is always more or less 
active. That upon which it is acting is that to which it is 
giving attention. Attention is the point of greatest activity 
in the mind) 
194
-P-A-G-E-211
ATTENTION 195 
The focus of consciousness. At any given instant in our 
waking lives our senses are being assailed by countless differ- 
ent stimuli. Light waves from every object within the range 
of our vision are playing upon the retinas of our eyes. Sounds 
of many sorts are almost continually entering our ears. 
There is usually some sort of odor in the atmosphere and 
some taste in our mouths. Some appreciable degree of 
warmth or coldness is affecting the temperature sense in the 
skin, and practically every inch of the surface of the body 
is being subjected to some pressure from our clothing, the 
things we are touching, currents of air, etc. Yet with all 
these and other sense processes going on, we are quite uncon- 
scious of most of them and are definitely noticing just one 
or a very few things. We are looking at some object, and for 
the time being the others which are in the range of sight 
have scarcely any more existence in our minds than if they 
were entirely out of sight. We are listening to one thing, and 
the others are not heard so far as we are aware. If, however, 
something else attracts our attention, we look at or listen 
to that, and it is the former thing that passes out of our 
minds. As we said, in discussing memory, an idea seems to 
“go out” when the current is turned off. As we saw in that 
connection, the countless things that we know are all lost 
in oblivion when we are not thinking about them. Of the 
innumerable experiences which you could be thinking about 
at this instant, of the whole range of ideas that you might be 
working with, all are out of existence for the time except 
just this that we are discussing. (The connections are still in 
the brain, but the current is not turned on) Unlike an electric 
illuminating current, the current of nervous energy can be 
turned on in full force at only one point in consciousness at 
“atime. While one part of the mind is active the others are 
inactive; while we are attending to one idea we are inatten- 
tive to all others. Or, to use another figure, attention may  
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
be likened to a searchlight, and the “mind” to the whole 
area over which it may throw its beams. It may be turned 
at will from one point to another ; it may “pick up” a mov- 
ing object and follow it; it may be held to one point, while 
all the other points in its field are in darkness. But it cannot 
be spread out over the whole field at once. This is the nature 
of the mind, it is focal; that is, its activity is always focused 
upon a single point. 
The range of attention. The single thing we are looking 
at may be one bird or a flock of birds, it may be one tree or 
one leaf of a tree or a whole forest ; we may listen to a single 
note of the violin or we may be attending to the whole com- 
posite music of the orchestra ; we may be observing a letter or 
a word or a sentence; we may be thinking of an individual 
thing or of any group or class of things; but in any case what 
we are attending to is a single idea, a single unit of thought. 
It is a single mental object. Our feet and many muscles may 
be engaged in walking (a habit which has become mechani- 
cal), our hands may be doing something else, while the mind 
is on yet another thing. Or the mind may be shifting with 
lightning rapidity about a group of more or less related sepa- 
rate things, or it may be wandering aimlessly about without 
much intensity of application to anything. But a careful 
analysis seems to indicate that at any instant only one 
thing can be in the focus of attention. Usually there is a 
more or less definite fringe of objects or ideas which are 
almost in focus, of which we are vaguely aware, which seem 
to be crowding into the edge of the focused area and demand- 
ing our attention, but they are just outside. Just before or 
after some especially exciting or interesting event it seems 
to stay very close to the focus: at any instant we are apt 
to find ourselves thinking about it; it tones or affects our 
thoughts of every other thing; we “cannot get it out of our 
minds”; it makes it hard for us to divert our attention to
-P-A-G-E-213
  
ATTENTION 197 
other things. But the mind is actually working on just one 
mental object at a time, however often that object may 
change." 
The function of attention. This limiting of the mind’s 
activity to one thing at a time may sometimes seem unfortu- 
nate, just as at times we may wish we could be in several 
places at once. Be this as it may, it is a marvelously wise 
provision that we can concentrate all the mental light we 
have, all our power of intellect, on each or any one point in 
its whole range at such time as we have need to do some- 
thing with that particular idea. The true value of any mental 
power (or physical power) is to be found in the way it aids 
us to react most advantageously to the situations in which 
we find ourselves. For this purpose the concentration of our 
whole mental force on one point at a time, together with the 
ability instantly to transfer it to some other point when 
needed, is unquestionably the most efficient scheme of which 
we can think. Attention thus not only focuses the whole 
power of the mind so as to attain the greatest intensity of 
efficient activity, but it is a selective process which is con- 
stantly choosing out from the whole world of sense material 
and ideas those which are of particular concern for our 
present purposes. 
Primitive attention. This tendency of the mind to act only 
at a focal point is, of course, a natural or instinctive char- 
acteristic. It is the only way the mind does act. We “pay 
attention” more or less vigorously whether we intend to or 
not. To do so purposely means that we select according to 
1Surprising exhibitions are given of writing quite distinct matter with 
each of the two hands simultaneously while answering questions, perform- 
ing mental calculations, etc. This can probably be explained as a remark- 
ably rapid shifting of attention, together with unusual automatization of 
some of the processes. If such cases are truly instances of multiple focus- 
ing of attention, they are so abnormal as not to affect our statement re- 
garding normal attention.  
-P-A-G-E-214
  
  198 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
our purpose the thing to which we shall be attentive and 
hold the mind with more or less effort to that thing. In 
primitive life, where intelligence and reflective thought are 
at a minimum, attention is valuable in the proportion in 
which it automatically turns the mind to the thing in one’s 
physical environment which “needs attention”; that is, to 
which one has need to react. If a thorn is pressing its way 
into the flesh of a savage, the consequent pain demands and 
insures his prompt attention and such adjustment as will 
remove the danger. If he hears a sound or sees a movement 
in the bushes, however slight the stimulus itself which indi- 
cates to him the presence of some mortal foe, his attention 
is immediately fixed upon this danger signal, and all less 
urgent matters must be put aside while he reacts according 
to his habit or intelligence. In more civilized life this primi- 
tive instinct still functions when pain, unusual or striking 
objects, loud, insistent or peculiar sounds, or an unexpected 
touch as of a slimy or furry surface which suggests some 
noxious animal, intrude themselves on our sense perception. 
Any sense phenomenon which by its very force or by its 
suggestion of importance to our welfare strikes in upon our 
conscious lives demands and gets attention. Psychologists 
speak of attention thus externally directed as involuntary 
attention or, because it is done ¢o us rather than by us, as 
passive attention. 
Intelligent or purposive attention. But in the intelligent 
life it is necessary to hold our minds to abstract things and 
to those which are uninteresting to a primitive mental organi- 
zation. It becomes necessary to pay attention to lessons 
even in spite of the countless things that are appealing to 
our instinctive involuntary attention. This purposive focus- 
ing of the mind is called voluntary or active attention. 
Obviously all study, all mind training, all ability to think of 
things other than those which are from moment to moment
-P-A-G-E-215
  
ATTENTION 199 
present to the senses, or to select those subtle qualities of 
things with which a primitive mind would not be occupied, 
are dependent upon this power of voluntary attention. Just 
as experience teaches the savage that the faint hiss of a 
serpent is of much more immediate concern to him than the 
loud roaring of the wind or the continuous thundering of 
the waves, so it is not the clanging of the trolley car nor the 
roar of a neighboring mill that concerns us so much as the 
problem of mathematics which we are solving or the abstract 
discussions of psychology which is our task for the time 
being. The increasing development of the thought life more 
and more involves the power of attending to ideas regardless 
of their sense appeal or inherent interest. This power of 
voluntary attention is the key to self-control and to mental 
mastery. 
Effective, enduring attention. But the turning of the mind 
to a subject or object is quite a different matter from holding 
it there while a difficult thought process is going on. The 
fact that the thinking is hard ordinarily means that the corti- 
cal connections involved are obscure, difficult to make, and 
require genuine effort. Opposed to this effort to hold the 
attentive center of the mind in difficult paths are the persua- 
sive attractions of all the objects and ideas which clamor for 
the involuntary attention. Our ability to hold to the matter 
in hand depends upon our ability to get a hearing for it, to 
connect with some beaten or established pathways through 
which the energy will flow freely to the new connections 
we are seeking to follow. Once this has been done the new 
associations seem to develop their own energy, which works 
its way step by step along the line of thought. We may com- 
pare it in this respect to a fire which is started slowly and 
with difficulty; but, once under way, it generates its own 
heat, which prepares the adjacent material to catch, and this 
in turn starts the next, and so it continues to gather force
-P-A-G-E-216
    200 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
and headway. By voluntary effort we may bring the atten- 
tion to bear upon a lesson problem, but involuntary at- 
tention will call it away again unless we can get into the 
subject sufficiently to generate this continuing sort of atten- 
tion which holds itself to the subject by its own activity. 
We apply the torch of active or voluntary attention only to 
start the fire of mental activity which will work its way 
through the problem. This continuing attention is some- 
times called by psychologists nonvoluntary or secondary 
passive attention. These names are applied because of the 
fact that no effort is required to hold the mind to the subject 
in which it is once actively engaged, and that while it is pas- 
sive in this sense, the process becomes so only after it has 
been well started by either the voluntary or the involuntary 
directing of the mind to the subject. A circus parade, for ex- 
ample, attracts the focus of mental activity by passive atten- 
tion, and then because of its natural interest holds it by the 
secondary passive sort. A novel may require an effort of the 
will, active attention, to get the process started, but we are 
soon absorbed in it because of this secondary passive atten- 
tion. This continuing attention, then, is the sort by which 
mental work is done, the mental motor power for which the 
others are merely starters. 
Control of attention. The practical problem we are con- 
cerned with in this whole matter is how to keep the mind 
at work where we want it to work. The simple savage or 
untrained mind is forever at the mercy of the senses, is at 
the beck and call of the easy or striking things which com- 
mand involuntary attention. The trained mind, on the other 
hand, through voluntary attention, directs its efforts where it 
will and gets the “secondary passive” activity at work upon 
those problems which the higher intelligence indicates are 
of the most consequence. We all know that it is not always 
easy to pay attention just when and where we should, and
-P-A-G-E-217
  
ATTENTION 201 
yet it is precisely upon one’s ability to do so that the power 
of his mind depends. Easy or hard, it must be done if our 
minds are to do work, to solve problems, to overcome diffi- 
culties. It would be very gratifying if we could suggest some 
simple trick by which this could be done, but there is none. 
Sheer determination alone can accomplish it. If at first we 
don’t succeed we must try, try again. The task is made 
much easier by removing the distractions of involuntary at- 
tention as far as possible. It is well to turn our backs to the 
window so that passing vehicles will not attract the eyes; to 
seek a quiet place or insist upon silence in our study room 
that attention may not be switched to frequent sounds ; to 
make provision for proper lighting. and temperature; to be 
comfortably seated and clothed; to have our pencils well 
sharpened and to provide good paper, pen, and ink or what- 
ever tools we are working with, so that none of these things 
may unnecessarily intrude themselves into our thought proc- 
esses once they get under way. Annoying worries and dis- 
tracting thoughts of pleasure make it hard to hold one’s 
mind to its task. If they intrude despite us we must deter- 
minedly recall our minds from them and focus on the task in 
hand until we have got the continuing attention under way 
and have lost ourselves in the active solution of our problem. 
The only way to keep the wrong thing out of mind is to keep 
busy on the right one. The only way to keep thinking of 
right things is simply not to think of wrong ones. The physi- 
cal world cannot be wholly prevented from sending messages 
to our eyes and ears, though we can to some extent remove 
ourselves from them. Effective concentration, however, is 
not in fleeing from disturbances, but in training ourselves to 
ignore them, to inhibit distracting ideas, and to focus and 
absorb our mental energy so completely in one problem at a 
time that others have no distracting force. “What can’t be 
cured must be endured!”
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
Bodily attitudes. If one is very attentively watching some- 
thing, there is a tendency to lean forward as though to get a 
closer view, although he may not thereby aid vision in the 
slightest. If one is listening intently, he tends to strain to- 
ward the source of the sound as though he could thus hear 
better. As one watches a race or a football game in which 
he is deeply interested, every muscle is strained and taut as 
though somehow he could thus help his team. A speaker 
often expresses his thought and feeling as much with his face 
and gestures as he does by his words. All this indicates 
something of the close relation there is between the activity 
of the mind and that of the body. Much can be done toward 
making a given mental activity more easy or more effective 
by assuming a bodily position in correspondence with it, by 
establishing a harmony between bodily and mental attitude. 
An alert, forward-leaning, aggressive position of the body 
is favorable to the vigorous conquest of mental problems. 
The schoolboy fighting hard with a troublesome task takes 
an aggressive position and supplements it with a frown, 
clenched teeth and fists, and a tension of the muscles of all 
the body. In studying a particularly difficult passage a good 
student finds much assistance in reading it aloud with all the 
expression possible and with emphatic gestures such as he 
would use in explaining the passage to another. To enjoy a 
humorous article thoroughly we should encourage the smiles 
and chuckles ; the suppression of them suppresses the enjoy- 
ment. An experienced teacher or public speaker is con- 
stantly reading the minds of his pupils or auditors through 
their facial expression. He knows which are actively at 
work and which are mentally idle, which are sympathetic 
and which are hostile. The posture and expression of the 
auditor not only aid but are actually a part of the hearing 
and understanding. Some writers regard this physical ten- 
sion as the essential character of attention.
-P-A-G-E-219
  
ATTENTION 203 
Habits of attention. The greatest aid in the control of 
attention is in making that control a habit. Habit, as we 
know, makes any form of activity easy, reliable, and auto- 
matic. The key to large powers of intellectual application 
and achievement is the habit of getting quickly into a sub- 
ject, of immediately and effectively eliminating all other mat- 
ters from the mind, of ignoring all sorts of distractions, of 
applying ourselves with all the intensity of concentration of 
which we are capable. Such habits, like all others, are at- 
tained by getting a clear idea of just what it is we wish to do 
and then doing it intensely, repeatedly, constantly, accu- 
rately and permitting ourselves no lapsing back into careless 
and ineffective ways. Not only are our powers tremendously 
increased in this way, but the joy of work is greater by the 
elimination of the constant conflict of annoying distractions. 
We have more time for equally complete relaxation and for 
enjoyment of well-earned pleasures. Too much stress cannot 
be laid on the value of habits of intense concentration as 
a means to an efficient, successful, and happy life. These 
habits are within the control of each student and are limited 
only by his determination. 
Concentration and mental momentum. When we consider 
(1) that mental activity goes on at only one point at a time, 
(2) that real effort and energy are required to focus it on any 
difficult task, (3) that continued concentration is required to 
generate the energy necessary to solve any difficult mental 
problem, (4) that the mental momentum is largely lost 
whenever one’s mind is withdrawn from one problem and 
directed upon another, it must be obvious that fluctuating 
attention is enormously wasteful of mental energy. It is as 
though a burning-glass focused the rays of the sun upon a 
point which one is seeking to set afire. Just as the smoke 
begins to rise, the rays are turned elsewhere for a moment. 
Again they are focused upon the point desired, but now it
-P-A-G-E-220
    204. PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
has cooled off, and the process must begin again from the 
start. So, again and again, nearly all that has been accom- 
plished is lost because the cumulative effect of the heat is 
wasted. And thus great attainment in mental work is de- 
pendent largely on momentum, and this upon continuous, 
unrelaxed pressure. Long periods of intense application ab- 
solutely free from physical distractions or mental fluctua- 
tions is the price we must pay for thinking things through. 
Trains of thought, like trains of cars, consume more energy 
in frequently starting, stopping, and starting again over a 
short distance than they do in continuous running for a long 
distance. It is the momentum that counts in covering dis- 
tances and in getting large results from power expended. 
Don’t waste your mental momentum on trivial distractions. 
Plans and schedules. Many an earnest, hardworking, and 
faithful student wastes much of his energy and meets with 
constant discouragement for the lack of a very simple 
device. His trouble is that in his conscientious zeal to do 
many things he permits his attention continuously to be 
distracted from one to another. He plunges into some ab- 
sorbing task, and about as soon as his attention has become 
fully effective for doing the work in hand to advantage, some- 
thing reminds him of another task undone. He feels that he 
is neglecting it. He drops the one thing and takes up the 
other. Presently he feels that he ought to have completed 
the first before leaving it. Then he hesitates about taking up 
a third, and to whichever he applies himself, or however hard 
he works at it, his attention is more or less wandering to the 
other things he thinks he ought to be doing. Concentration 
under such conditions is impossible, and hence efficient work 
cannot be done. If, now, he should list in advance all the 
tasks he has to do; assign to each the due proportion of time 
that it should receive, allowing ample time for rest, recrea- 
tion, and other things necessary or worth while; arrange a
-P-A-G-E-221
  
ATTENTION 205 
schedule showing just what he proposes to do in each of the 
twenty-four hours; check over the schedule until he is satis- 
fied that it is as he wants it, then follow it without question 
or hesitation,—he will immediately be relieved of all anxiety 
and distraction as to the use of his time. Then when any task 
is taken up he knows that during the time given to it on the 
schedule, nothing else is of any concern to him. In this 
simple manner the hardest workers may often more than 
double their mental efficiency without increase of effort. 
A train of thought, to maintain its momentum, must have 
a clear track. Form the habit of working by schedule. Be- 
fore starting a task that requires concentration decide that 
it is the one thing you want to do at that time. Then forget 
everything else. 
Fatigue and second wind. To those who make it a habit 
the power of concentration is capable of surprising develop- 
ment. The only limit fixed is that of physical exhaustion. 
Nerve energy is consumed in continued mental exertion to 
the point where it is no longer capable of sustaining attention 
or doing work effectively. Everyone knows the effect on 
mental work of being tired either mentally or physically. 
Ideas simply will not come at our call. The mind wanders 
and trails off into sleepiness. So far as work is done at all 
it is likely to be full of errors. Things have lost their interest. 
The work does not seem worth while. We find ourselves star- 
ing at a page, and utterly oblivious of what we are reading 
about. Under such conditions concentration, intensity, and 
hence effective work are impossible. It is usually not worth 
while working when the mind is fatigued.CGenuine fatigue 
is due to the presence in the system of a toxin caused by the 
combustion of nerve and muscle tissue as a result of their 
activity. This poison is removed automatically by respira- 
tion, circulation, and other vital processes. More fatigue is 
caused in the life of the average person by the failure of these
-P-A-G-E-222
  206 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
elimination processes to remove effectively the poison than 
by the work that produces it. Then, too, it. is produced as 
much or more by irritation, worry, distraction, eyestrain, 
indigestion, and countless other unwholesome mental and 
physical conditions than by actual work. Abundant fresh air, 
vigorous exercise, deep sleep, avoidance of rich and excessive 
food, regular habits, calm, poise, freedom from worry, laugh- 
ter,—vigorous, healthy, happy living,—these are the best 
preventives of fatigue and hence the best means of increas- 
ing the power of sustained profitable work. Insured by these 
healthful conditions, one need fear no danger of mental 
overwork. A healthy person has vast resources of reserve 
energy—stored probably in the sympathetic nerve system— 
upon which he seldom draws. The renewed power which one 
gets with his “second wind” is due to the first tapping of 
this reserve store. Under hypnotic conditions and under the 
stress of some powerful stimulus which causes one to forget 
himself for the time, one discloses a capacity for both physi- 
cal and mental endurance he would not have dreamed pos- 
sible for his ordinary self. This is not some new sort of 
power acquired. It is merely reserve energy released. There 
is probably no danger in such unusual display of energy so 
long as the normal physical conditions and processes are not 
interfered with. Certainly in the humdrum activity of study 
there is no chance of overexertion. Tired nature will inva- 
riably put us to sleep long before the system is endangered— 
provided always that we are not artificially stimulated by 
drugs of any kind and that we exercise vigorously, eat 
heartily, and sleep soundly. “Overstudy” is almost invari- 
ably physical disorder of some sort, due perhaps to ‘worry, 
irregularity in sleep and eating, unnatural stimulations, lack 
of exercise, etc. It is probable that no one has found the 
absolute limit of possibility for mental exertion. If you are 
ambitious to accomplish great things, make sure that your 
 
-P-A-G-E-223
ATTENTION 207 
physical condition is sound and vigorous and then don’t be 
afraid of “overstudy.” The efficiency of work, however, is 
measured rather by the intensity than by the length of the 
period of study. Although under the stress of emergency one 
may work many hours under intense pressure, a regular 
program of study will achieve better results if divided into 
periods of an hour or two followed by a short, complete relax- 
ation or perhaps a change in the character of work. Many 
executives whose work requires a very high order of con- 
centrated attention find that they can accomplish more in a 
four-hour to six-hour day than in a day of eight or ten hours. 
The ideal schedule will vary with the individual and with the 
character of work to be done, but it should always be planned 
with a view to working under high pressure. This habit of 
intensity of attention is the means of continuously increasing 
one’s capacity for effective work. One can acquire no in- 
crease in muscular power except by exerting to the limit the 
power he already has. The same is true of mental power. 
Mental work to the point of genuine fatigue is part of the 
price of greater mental capacity. 
Purpose the key to attention. Perhaps chief among the 
conditions which determine one’s ability to concentrate his 
attention upon a given idea is the attitude or “set” of his 
mind toward that idea. This will be discussed in the follow- 
ing chapter on interest and in the chapter on the will. The 
knowledge that one has of a subject and his interest in it 
are among the factors that limit his capacity to hold his 
attention to it, but the principal factor is one’s purpose. 
Without a definite purpose, without a problem to solve or a 
recognized situation to meet by means of his mental activity, 
attention wanders aimlessly from. sense stimulus to sense 
stimulus. With a clear, positive purpose thinking becomes 
reasoning, judgments progress directly from data to conclu- 
sion, knowledge is organized and ordered to a definite end.

For such thinking only is attention definitely and continu- 
ously available. Attention is the place where the mind is at 
work. It works only where it has a purpose in view, where it 
has work to do.

controlling your attention? To what sort of distraction is this diffi- 
culty mainly due? Which of these can you eliminate by making 
proper physical preparations for your study? 
6. Why does one seek an easy-chair or lie down to read a novel, 
but sit at a table in a straight chair to work problems? Does the 
physical attitude affect the success of the process? 
7. Watch the face of a student at work and note when he 
struggles with particularly difficult points, when he conquers them,

  CHAPTER XIV 
INTEREST 
Attention and interest. In the preceding chapter we saw 
that the purpose of voluntary attention is to hold the mind 
to a subject until with the arousing of the continuing atten- 
tion an interest develops which makes it easy to continue ac- 
tive and effective work. It is well known to us all that it is 
easy to pay attention to that in which we are interested. Thus 
it is that attention begets interest and interest begets atten- 
tion. This, so far from being a paradox, as it might at first 
appear, is quite the law of nature generally. Health gives 
strength and strength brings health. Wealth gives us power 
and power brings wealth. Knowledge gives us wisdom and 
wisdom gets more knowledge. This is not a mere closed cir- 
cle, but a spiral form of progress. “To him that hath shall be 
given.” Attention is a phase of activity. Interest is a condi- 
tion which is favorable for that activity. Attention is some- 
thing that we do: we pay or give attention. We have, feel, 
or take interest. It is a state of mind. 
The object of interest. But interest is always a state of the 
mind with relation to something in particular. We are not 
simply interested, we are interested in something. This object 
or subject or idea in which we are interested becomes a sort of 
center of force which radiates mental energy to every thought 
that may be associated with it. Speaking physiologically, it 
is the development of some brain center of synaptic pathways 
such that-neural energy readily passes from it to any path- 
ways which connect with it. It is a center of stored energy 
210
-P-A-G-E-227
  
INTEREST 211 
which vitalizes and invigorates any mental activity which 
it calls into play. Thus it is that attention, which is simply 
the focus of mental activity, is easily attracted to any center 
of interest. 
What things are interesting? From the discussion of cen- 
ters of interest in the preceding paragraphs it is evident that 
we are interested in the things that we know something 
about. Persons, subjects of study, topics of conversation of 
which we are entirely ignorant, have no interest for us, and 
the degree of our interest in any of them is limited almost 
precisely by the extent of our knowledge about them. On 
the other hand, it is true that we are interested in the new, 
strange, and unusual thing and almost precisely in the degree 
in which it is new, strange,and unusual. The stale joke, the 
old story, the object or topic that we “know all about,” has 
lost its interest. How shall we reconcile this apparent con- 
tradiction? Interest in the new, strange, unusual, or striking 
thing is of that sort which attracts the primitive or passive 
attention. It is a biological necessity. It is nature’s way of 
forcing a savage to give attention to that which may be of 
urgent importance to his safety. It is an instinctive respon- 
siveness to that which has not yet been classified as useful, 
dangerous, or of no consequence. After he has turned his 
attention to it and it proves to be of no consequence it ceases 
to be of interest. It is pretty much the same in our civilized 
life. The strange animal or bug or curiously dressed native 
of some remote country attracts attention for a moment, but 
as soon as the novelty has worn off, it loses interest. But if 
a learned biologist finds a bug that is new to him, his 
entomological center of interest is aroused, and he applies all 
the zeal and knowledge he has acquired in his years of study 
to a thorough examination and classification of the speci- 
men. It may be a red-letter day in his life when this new 
specimen first comes to his attention. It is worth months of 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
arduous study, and his interest increases with his growing 
knowledge. The interest in the novel thing is externally 
aroused and is due to the difficulty of apperceiving it. The 
interest in the familiar is due to the energizing power of 
the apperceiving core. Any kind of interest is fundamentally 
a condition favorable for mental activity; that is, for at- 
tention. If there is no activity started, if there is nothing 
to be done about the matter, that is equivalent to saying 
that there is no interest. Hence the new or strange thing 
loses interest if it establishes no associations with previous 
knowledge and suggests nothing to be done. The familiar 
or well-known thing loses interest when it gives us no new 
problems to be solved, when it offers us nothing to act upon. 
Whether thorough knowledge will increase or decrease inter- 
est depends on our point of view. If there is nothing to be 
learned and nothing more to be done, interest quickly wanes. 
If the knowledge serves to give us insight into new problems 
for solution, it gives force and energy for the solution of 
them. These energizing centers of brain activity must per- 
force have some activity to energize. It has been said that 
we are interested in the old aspects of new things and new 
aspects of old things. If this is an accurate statement it is 
another way of saying that we are interested in new things to 
the extent to which we can interpret them in terms of the old 
and in the old things in the degree to which we can find 
new aspects to deal with. In either case we are interested in 
any object just to the extent to which it offers us something 
to react to or which we can mentally do something about. 
The mind is interested only in that which offers it some- 
" thing to do, some problem to solve, some occasion for activ- 
ity. Problem-solving, activity, is mental life. The active 
mind is interested. The interested mind is active. 
Range of interests. There is no limit to the number of such 
centers of interest which may be established in one’s mind, 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
INTEREST 213 
nor is there any limit to the degree of vital force which may 
be stored in each. It is possible to have a narrow mind, a 
“single-track mind” with very few interests, or to have a 
broad mind which is interested in almost every phase of 
knowledge, progress, science, art, and every other thing 
which has any human interest whatever. It is possible to be 
only mildly or slightly interested in a given topic or to have 
such an intense interest in it as to be almost dead to any 
other concerns except that one. The extent and intensity of 
one’s interests not only disclose his present mental develop- 
ment but are the surest indication of what his future growth 
is to be. The interests that one has consist in the knowledge 
of a vital sort that he has acquired. Knowledge that has been 
effectively apperceived is organized about centers which 
serve to interpret new knowledge as acquired. These are 
sometimes called apperceptive centers or apperceptive cores 
because it is this knowledge which gives meaning to new 
related knowledge. When one reads a daily paper it is the 
knowledge which he has already organized in a vital way 
which enables him to understand and utilize what he reads. 
Lacking these centers, that which one reads is not grasped, is 
not organized with his previous knowledge; hence it is not 
retained, does not add to his knowledge. On the other hand, 
each center which is vital with clear, organized knowledge 
enables one to perceive and apperceive vigorously each item 
of related knowledge as it presents itself. This adds to the 
extent and force of the apperceiving or interest center, which 
grows by what it feeds upon, increases by its activity its 
power for activity, or, to change the figure again, like a snow- 
ball rolling downhill, the larger it grows the faster it grows. 
Again is illustrated the law “to him that hath shall be 
given.” 
Interest and apperception. It is a matter of frequent ob- 
servation that if several persons ride through a country on a 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  214 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
train, although all see the same things with their eyes, their 
minds see quite differently. One notices the kinds and con- 
ditions of the crops in the fields. He is a farmer. Another 
notices the construction of the houses. He is a builder. An- 
other catches the picturesque spots and color effects. He is 
an artist. Each apperceives according to his centers of inter- 
est. It is the same in reading a paper. One sees little but the 
political news; another is interested in the local news; an- 
other turns immediately to the fashion columns and house- 
hold hints ; while others, not a few, have little interest except 
in the sporting page. The whole of life, with its limitless 
opportunities, is one mighty panorama of infinitely varied 
facts and materials of knowledge. From it each of us is con- 
stantly adding to his mental equipment that which his in- 
terests, according to their range and vitality, select and 
assimilate. 
Education as a planting of interests. Much of the busi- 
ness of school life is precisely to provide the pupil with 
cores of interest. The history and geography which are 
learned from school texts and lessons is of little consequence 
in itself, but as a means of interpreting, assimilating, and 
accumulating a store of knowledge from day to day as one 
goes through the experiences of an intelligent life, these 
little nuclei of knowledge and interest are of incalculable 
importance. A school course in literature may be quite insig- 
nificant in its actual attainments, but if it serves as a key by 
which one may enter and take possession of the world of 
masterpieces of beauty and wisdom which have been pre- 
pared for us through all the ages of men, it is a possession 
beyond all price. Elementary courses in science or govern- 
ment or sociology may give us but a meager and impracti- 
cable body of dry facts and principles, attained at the cost of 
much labor and wholly without immediate usefulness; but 
if they function as centers of interest they will gradually,
-P-A-G-E-231
  
INTEREST 215 
through all the readings and experiences of life, gather to 
themselves countless valuable bits of knowledge and continu- 
ously interpret and organize these until the whole becomes 
a body of effective information and thought power which 
makes one a wise and well-posted thinker in these fields. 
Not only do they serve thus to gather knowledge incidentally 
and occasionally, but they afford the interest and guidance 
which lead to systematic future studies in school or out, and 
these lead to yet greater powers of selection, acquisition, and 
organization which make the master thinker and leader. 
Thus it is that the mental “great oaks from little acorns 
grow.” The wise youth will scorn no tiny seed of knowledge 
which may be the beginning of a great tree of knowledge 
and interest. 
Interests to be acquired as well as used. In ignorance of 
this tremendously important principle of the vital and grow- 
ing character of centers of interest, young people—and older 
ones—avoid classic musical concerts because they are not 
interested in them. They stay away from art galleries be- 
cause they are more interested in the motion pictures. They 
read trashy novels and “Sunday supplements” because they 
are not interested in higher-grade literature and writings of 
permanent value. The lack of interest in the things that are 
worth while should be the strongest of reasons for getting in 
touch with these things at whatever cost of attention and 
effort, for it is by so doing that the new centers of interest are 
established. Once started, they grow by exercise and nour- 
ishment until they attain a power and value beyond all 
price. It is more important and more necessary to seek the 
things worth while because we are not interested in them 
than to do so because we are interested. 
Purpose and interest. We are interested in whatever for- 
wards or obstructs our purposes. The more important and 
vital our purpose the greater our interest in all that concerns 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
it. The man with a great purpose in life is never lacking in 
interests. The purposeless drifter is very apt to find life 
“stale, flat, and unprofitable.” The reason is clear. One’s 
purpose is his definitely chosen plan of action. Whatever 
affects it offers him an opportunity favorable for action. A 
challenge to thought or action is always an interest. 
Play interests. We are interested in the scenes, the dramas, 
and the stories which excite and thrill us, because they 
arouse intense mental activity without the strain of mental 
effort in getting the process under way. The serious effort 
of active attention which forces the mind along unaccus- 
tomed pathways, with no particular satisfaction in that 
effort itself, is of the nature of work. It is activity engaged 
in for the sake of some interest outside of and beyond itself. 
Play is activity engaged in for the sake of pleasure or satis- 
faction in itself. It is mental play to be entertained by a 
motion picture or a thrilling story, which provides through 
the senses and imagery all necessary guide and stimulation 
to pleasurable activity. 
Minds barren of interest. Mental enjoyment through this 
play sort of interests is desirable for entertainment and re- 
laxation, but pitiful is the state of that helpless individual 
who has no source of mental activity except when stimulated 
from the outside. The mind that has no resources of interest 
within itself is usually forced to live by servile, routine 
drudgery, and then can turn for relaxation or amusement 
only to the limited range of sensational shows, motion pic- 
tures, “jazz concerts,” and similar forms of mental stimu- 
lants. The blazing lights of the “Great White Way”; the 
bloody thrillers of cheap motion pictures and trashy stories ; 
the brainless shows which for lack of thought or beauty sub- 
stitute exhibitions of the morbid, criminal, or indecent; the 
screaming headlines of sensational journals ceaselessly ap- 
pealing to the passions and prejudices of people,—all these
-P-A-G-E-233
  
INTEREST 217 
are ways by which money-seeking exhibitors capitalize the 
craving of empty minds for excitement and thrills. A mind 
well equipped with vital centers of interest in political and 
social affairs, in business and professional concerns, in litera- 
ture, history, and art, wit and humor, travel and anecdote, 
is prepared to find its highest satisfaction in things which are 
in themselves educative and improving. To such the merely 
morbid, sensational, or indecent has no appeal. The currents 
of thought and interest come from springs welling up from 
within rather than from the splashings of other minds from 
without. The barren mind which is forever in need of ‘some 
excitement” to help “kill time” is to be pitied—a helpless 
thing subject to the changing winds of circumstances and the 
devices of designing sellers of sensation. Contentment, last- 
ing pleasures, and deep satisfaction, as well as all the keys 
to better living, are to be found in the mind which carries its 
own well-organized and vital centers of interest.

CHAPTER XV 
LIKES AND DISLIKES 
A quality which mental processes have. To what was said 
in the last chapter about the kinds of things that are inter- 
esting, we may add that we are also interested in things that 
are pleasant and in avoiding those that are unpleasant. This 
quality of pleasantness or unpleasantness seems to be pres- 
ent in more or less noticeable degree in all mental states 
and activities. It was seen that instinctive tendencies are 
strengthened when they are pleasant and are inhibited or 
checked if disagreeable. Habits, likewise, are easily fixed 
if their exercise is agreeable, but it is hard to establish them 
when their performance is disagreeable. All are aware that 
some sensations are pleasurable and others quite the oppo- 
site. Ideas, too, are often agreeable or the contrary. Our 
imagery may be repulsive or attractive. Memories are 
pleasant or unpleasant. And so all our thinking may take on 
agreeable or disagreeable character, either from the quality 
of the ideas, memories, and images involved in it or from 
some conditions of the thinking process itself. This charac- 
teristic of all mental processes, by virtue of which they are 
attractive or unattractive, agreeable or disagreeable, pleasant 
or unpleasant, or whatever similar terms we may choose to 
apply, is, then, not some new or separate process, but a 
quality which all mental processes have in greater or less 
degree. Just as all physical things have some color, some 
temperature, some degree of hardness or softness, so all men- 
tal things have some degree of pleasantness-unpleasantness. 
219
-P-A-G-E-236
  220 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
To be sure, many things are neutrally toned as to the physi- 
cal properties named: they may be neither cold nor hot, but 
they have some temperature; they may be neither hard nor 
soft, but they have some degree of density; they may be 
quite inconspicuous as to color, but some color they must 
have. So, many of our mental states do not impress us as 
being either particularly pleasant or particularly unpleasant, 
but they must at least be somewhere along the scale between 
the decidedly agreeable and the decidedly disagreeable. 
Physiological basis of the affective element. Physiologi- 
cally this pleasant-unpleasant quality, which psychologists call 
the affective element, depends on a favorable or unfavorable 
condition of the nervous system with respect to the process 
affected by it. A smooth, full, free, and unobstructed flow of 
nervous energy over a series of synapses involved in a given 
activity is experienced as pleasant, while an obstructed flow 
of energy is (ordinarily) experienced as unpleasant. Why or 
under what conditions does the energy thus sometimes flow 
freely and sometimes otherwise? Naturally it flows fully 
and freely over pathways that are well established, whether 
inherited or acquired. This is to say that customary, ha- 
bitual, and instinctive tendencies are normally agreeable. 
The things we are accustomed to do are easy and comfort- 
able things to do. They do not involve the strain and effort 
necessary to build up new connections. On the other hand, 
when energy is abundant and is vigorously seeking outlet, 
new activities are often quite pleasant because of the whole- 
some and enjoyable activity involved in making new connec- 
tions. Again, there are in the nervous system not only formed 
pathways favorable to the free passage of energy, but there 
are others which are just as definitely blocked. The sight. of 
snakes and crawling things generally, certain tastes and 
odors, and other objects and ideas arouse an inherited or 
developed repugnance. The nervous system automatically 
‘
-P-A-G-E-237
  
LIKES AND DISLIKES 220 
shuts its doors and lifts its drawbridges against these stimuli, 
and sets in motion the muscular machinery to repel them or 
to remove us from their presence. A disagreeable stimulus of 
any sort tends to contract the muscles of the entire body, to 
cause a shrinking away, to suppress the heart action, and to 
make the breathing shallow and rapid; on the other hand, a 
pleasant stimulus causes a general expansion of the muscles, 
an actual increase in their volume, a strong and steady heart 
action, and full, deep breathing. These results are proved by 
actual laboratory measurements. A vigorous and healthy con- 
dition sends full, strong currents of energy coursing through 
the system, fills the whole life with joy and gladness, and 
makes all the world seem rosy ; while a diseased or weakened 
condition for the time seems to “take all the joy out of life.” 
We have seen that vigorous centers of interest tend to spread 
their energizing force over all the pathways that may be 
connected up with them. This is but a form of the affective 
element. The agreeable tone always tends to spread out 
from any center where it may be particularly strong to what- 
ever paths may be associated with it. Unpleasantness, how- 
ever, does likewise. Whatever is closely associated with a 
disagreeable experience tends to share in the disagreeableness. 
Psychological character of the affective element. Psycho- 
logically it would be very difficult to describe or define this 
affective quality, and it is not at all necessary that we should. 
Each of us knows it as a part of his own most intimate experi- 
ence. We know that nausea, a severe pain, bad tastes and 
smells, disappointment, discouragement, and other things are 
unpleasant, and we do not need anyone to tell us what 
the unpleasantness is like; but many feelings, tastes, odors, 
thoughts, and experiences generally may be altogether agree- 
able, and we need no explanation or definition to tell us what 
this means. Just why some things should be agreeable and 
others disagreeable is often hard to understand, yet we can 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  
  222 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
frequently discover just such causes as we should anticipate 
from the physiological conditions involved. For example, 
those things are agreeable which have been associated in the 
past with agreeable experiences, and vice versa. As the ex- 
periences of different persons are more or less different, that 
which is agreeable or disagreeable to one may affect another 
quite differently. What is enjoyable to one in a vigorous con- 
dition of body and happy state of mind may be quite objec- 
tionable to another who is sick or sad. The same individual 
may vary greatly in his likes and dislikes according to his 
mood or physical condition. Even our inherited likes and 
dislikes are subject to much variation from person to person, 
as though they echoed somehow the happy and unhappy 
experiences of our ancestors through countless forgotten 
generations. 
The problem of esthetics. Yet we all know that there are 
things essentially pleasurable to all normal persons and others 
as universally objectionable. It would be an endless task to 
attempt to classify objects according to their pleasing and 
displeasing qualities and to analyze out of their complexities 
the precise elements which account for their effect upon us. 
The science of esthetics has attempted this, in part, and has 
laid down certain principles which apply to art, architecture, 
music, and other arts whose function is to please. Generally 
speaking, we know that harmonious sounds are pleasant and 
discords are not. Some combinations of color delight us 
and others seem to “swear at each other.” Certain lines and 
proportions in buildings and works of art are attractive, 
while others offend or repel us. Sweet tastes, bright colors, 
fragrant odors, and soft, smooth, warm things are commonly 
pleasant, but under many conditions it may be precisely the 
opposite qualities which please us most. At times we desire 
the things that are restful, quiet, and soothing; at other 
times we crave that which is exhilarating and thrilling.
-P-A-G-E-239
LIKES AND DISLIKES 223 
Biological function of the affective element. The normal 
effect of pleasantness is to forward and encourage the activ- 
ity to which it belongs, while disagreeableness tends to in- 
hibit the process. In primitive life this affective element is 
the only guide the creature has to indicate whether or not 
the activity in which it is engaged makes for its welfare. It 
is nature’s crude substitute for intelligence. The animal 
seeks the things that are pleasant and avoids those which are 
not. Whatever causes it pain is presumably not for its good 
and hence is avoided; whatever satisfies and pleases is pre- 
sumably to be desired. Pleasures and pains are thus nature’s 
way of directing conduct, of indicating right and wrong. 
Some philosophers, reasoning from an assumed wisdom of 
nature, have sought to prove thus that the right road to wel- 
fare and happiness is simply to follow our pleasures. Life 
would be very simple if this guide were a safe one. Such an 
existence would be a veritable heaven for a lazy mind and 
conscience. But if that had been nature’s plan, she would 
never have supplied us with an intelligence. Only in the 
lowest forms of life and in an absolutely unchanging condi- 
tion of existence is the pleasure-pain index an effective guide 
to conduct. Other philosophers, of Stoic persuasion, thinking 
only of the frequent conflict between physical satisfaction 
and moral duty, have decried the yielding to pleasures as the 
certain road to destruction. The truth, of course, is that the 
affective element, like instinct generally, is blind. It is a 
product of the past, not a prophecy of the future. Pain un- 
doubtedly is a warning of danger; physical discomforts are 
indications of the need of better adjustments of some sort. 
But intelligence tells us that the surest relief from a tooth- 
ache may be the greater pain inflicted by the dentist, that the 
discomforts of disease may best be cured by voluntarily 
seeking the more intense discomforts of nauseating medi- 
cines or surgical operations. We struggle on against fatigue  
-P-A-G-E-240
  224 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
and discomforts of countless sorts to reach the higher satis- 
faction which comes from purposes accomplished or the hap- 
piness of others. If the affective element were an adequate 
guide for our conduct, we should not have been provided with 
intelligence ; but since we have this higher means of directing 
our conduct, it should be used if we would live an enlightened 
human life rather than the life of helpless primitive creatures 
of circumstance. 
Control of likes and dislikes. It is altogether desirable that 
we should use our intelligence to secure for ourselves as much 
of pleasure as we may. This quality, which was originally a 
means of finding safety, becomes a reward for the higher 
safety found by the intelligence. But intelligence must look 
beyond the immediate pleasures and pains to the ultimate 
values which they signify. In our complex lives, especially, 
the agreeable and disagreeable qualities have ceased to be 
even the approximate indications of good and bad which they 
were in the life of the lowest creatures. Only a very weak 
character would allow his life to be directed by the push and 
pull of his likes and dislikes. Instead he deliberately sets 
about to like the things that are for his best interests and to 
dislike the things that are not for his good. For the affective 
element is very largely under control. We may cultivate a 
taste for almost anything if we have the persistence to accus- 
tom ourselves to it and to associate it closely with pleasur- 
able ideas of the good that is to come from it. Whatever we 
can continuously think of as being very desirable, we can 
overcome our repugnance for, since the sense organs grad- 
ually become adapted to anything that is not positively 
destructive. What we cannot actually like in itself we can 
endure with joy, in the anticipation of the greater good that 
is to come from it. “If you can’t do what you like, like what 
you do” is a pretty good piece of advice. 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
LIKES AND DISLIKES. 225 
Pleasures and character. Happily for us the pleasantest 
things in this world are wholesome things and the best things 
are pleasant. Sunshine, fresh air, pure water, exercise and 
sound sleep, plain foods, good companionship, innocent fun, 
happy song and play, successful work, “plain living and 
high thinking,”—things of this sort bring most joy in a 
wholesome, well-ordered life. Lazy inaction and excessive 
excitement, morbid music and impure literature, highly 
seasoned foods and all stimulants, narcotics, and intoxicants, 
—all those unwholesome things which people sometimes 
crave to satisfy their jaded appetites, their unnaturally 
stimulated tastes, or their passions,—these things are not for 
good and they are not agreeable except to abnormal and 
unnatural tastes. It is the twisted philosophy of an un- 
wholesome mind or the perverted taste of an unwholesome 
body that finds bad things pleasant and good things dis- 
agreeable. The truest indication of one’s character is found 
in his likes and dislikes. Does he enjoy the things that are 
low and mean or those that are lofty and pure? Is his love 
of license stronger than his love of truth, of honor, and of 
the public good? Is the happiness and well-being of others 
pleasant to him? Is the society of good people agreeable to 
him or does he prefer that of foul minds? Does he like 
wholesome work? By such things you know the sort of man 
he is, the quality of his citizenship, his worth to society. 
Optimism and success. The key to a happy life, then, is 
to learn to like the things that are most wholesome and 
profitable. This is accomplished by doing the things we 
ought to do when we ought to do them, whether we like to do 
them or not. The foolish habit of thinking and talking about 
work and duty as if they were inherently disagreeable is 
the chief obstacle in the road to success and happiness for 
many a young person. Unless one is hopelessly incompetent 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  226 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
for and out of adjustment with the work he has to do, it is 
only necessary to plunge into it without hesitation or com- 
plaining, to do it with his might just as well as he possibly 
can do it, to take an interest and pride in doing it as 
well as possible, to keep cheerful meanwhile and to think of 
the rewards and satisfaction which come from tasks well and 
faithfully done, and he will presently find a real pleasure in 
the work. It is only necessary to hesitate and procrastinate, 
to complain and dwell on the disagreeable aspects of the 
task, to think of the other things which would be pleasanter 
to do, to slight and neglect one’s work and find fault with a 
hard lot which consigns one to an unhappy fate or to durance 
vile, and one’s life becomes a dreary round of unprofitable 
drudgery and unappreciated toil. The joy of life is what we 
put into it, not what is put upon us. When one thus reso- 
lutely likes the tasks he has to do, he is fairly sure to do 
them well, and thus he wins his way to promotion and the 
sort of work that is more easy to like. The happy habit of 
liking whatever we must do or endure thus brings its own 
sweet reward as we go along, but it is also the surest road 
to efficiency in that task and to prompt relief from it. This is 
particularly true in educational tasks, where the only safe 
way to leave a task is to finish it well. Avoid, then, talking 
of your work as though you hate it. It is the thinking 
of it so that makes it hateful. Talk rather as though you 
enjoyed it; keep thinking of it happily. Do not be afraid 
to “fool yourself” into thinking you like it. “Kid your- 
self” all you can in that direction, until you really think 
you like it—and then you really do. You can do the same 
with your friends, teachers, associates. If they are the 
sort you ought to like, just determine to like them and pro- 
ceed to do so. Many a sad story of unhappy married life, 
divorce, and scandal has grown from the young people’s
-P-A-G-E-243
  
LIKES AND DISLIKES 227 
foolish tendency to dwell upon the things in each other which 
they dislike. There is enough that is disagreeable in the best 
of people to make life with them unhappy if we think only 
of such things; but there is enough that is lovable in any 
decent person to make life happy for one who is determined 
to see only that which is lovable and to love whatever is 
seen. To “fool yourself” into believing that you have the 
dearest 2nd best wife or husband in the world is not less 
practicable psychologically, and is infinitely wiser practically, 
than to do what is much more common in fiction (though 
less so, we hope, in fact)—to drift into unhappiness and 
“incompatibility” by believing that you do not love the one 
you have chosen for life. Fill your life with joy and bring it 
to those about you by liking those you ought to like and 
loving those you ought to love. If you find it hard, just like 
them or love them all the harder. For this affective element, 
this pleasantness or unpleasantness, agreeableness or dis- 
agreeableness, like or dislike, love or hate, is not the master 
but the slave of intelligence. It is a beautiful thing in life, it 
is the spice and flavor of existence, it is the reward of wisdom 
or the penalty of folly, it is a help or a hindrance which we 
may apply where we will, it is the color which keeps life 
from becoming drab and dull. It pushes and pulls us hither 
and yon, it urges us forward or holds us back, it makes some 
things hard and it makes others easy. It serves as our guide 
in countless affairs of life. Lower animals have no better 
guide, but in the life of beings possessed of intelligence, 
reason should determine where the affective element shall 
lead. Thus we are vouchsafed all its pleasures and joys, its 
cheer, brightness, and color, but can rise above its blind and 
often destructive fatalism. In your life shall the affective 
element rule or serve?

CHAPTER XVI 
EMOTIONS 
Affective element intensified. Sometimes the affective ele- 
ment is not merely a gentle stimulating or retarding tone of 
an intellectual process. It is often a great flood of neural 
energy surging through the nervous system with an intensity 
which wholly obscures the mental process which gave rise 
to it. We are provided in our “fearfully and wonderfully 
made” organisms not only with the local centers of interest 
and the mildly invigorating centers of affective stimulation 
but with tremendous reservoirs of that nervous energy which, 
when once the floodgates have been loosed, sweeps away in 
its resistless current all judgment, reasoning,and normal men- 
tal associations. Such general disturbances commonly occur 
as reactions to particular stimuli. Some object or idea, which 
might under normal conditions start a calm intellectual proc- 
ess more or less affectively toned, seems to tap some mighty 
reservoir and turn loose the overwhelming flood which breaks 
down all ordinary controls, upsets normal balances and safe- 
guards, arouses violent physical activity, and often leaves the 
entire mind and body exhausted, confused, and out of ad- 
justment. These violent upheavals are known as emotions. 
Some emotional states, to be sure, may be relatively mild, 
but they are emotional to just the degree that they are 
disturbances. 
Physical basis of emotion. The physiological background 
of emotion is obviously similar to that of the affective ele- 
ment, only much intensified. The pathways into which en- 
229 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
230 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
ergy flows with such violent force must be those which are 
deep-laid in our inherited connections or which have been 
established by intense and vivid experiences. The reservoirs 
are more than the mild centers of interest. The so-called 
“sympathetic nerve system” seems to serve in large part as 
a store of excess energy which is released on occasion of 
these emotional upheavals. The release of this energy not 
only floods the specific connections involved in responding to 
the particular stimulus, but overflows violently through the 
whole nervous organization. 
Biological function of emotions. Emotions, like every other 
natural tendency, physical or mental, serve a valuable pur- 
pose somewhere in the development and life of the creatures 
in which they occur. To understand this function we must 
again glance back to the primitive existence of men and of 
animals in a low order of existence. There are situations in 
the life of a savage or of a wild animal when their embry- 
onic intelligence is wholly inadequate to determine the neces- 
sary line of action or to set it effectively in motion. (When 
confronted with a serious danger which one is incapable of 
understanding or intelligently combating, some powerful im- 
pulse is necessary to get the legs in motion for effective flight 
or to get the lungs in motion to utter a useful call for help or 
to frighten the enemy.) One must run or scream before he 
can think. Slow-acting thought is ineffective in the face of 
an energetic enemy, and the fighting force of blind rage is 
the only means of safety or victory. The very preservation 
of the primitive race depends upon a sexual attraction and 
mother love which does not wait for the feeble reason or 
intellectual purpose. The presence of a serpent, indicated by 
a characteristic slight movement or gentle hiss, is a matter 
of too vital concern in primitive life to trust to any reasoned 
response. Action instant and vigorous is imperative, and 
the inherited instinctive machinery insures that this slight 
 
-P-A-G-E-247
  
EMOTIONS 231 
stimulus shall release a powerful response to the exclusion 
of all other interests. Thus nature has provided in emotions 
a means of instant and effective action which functions in 
many situations of most vital concern to the creature. 
Emotions and evolution. But the tendency to inherit these 
deep-laid instinctive pathways persists long after the changed 
conditions of civilized life have removed the necessity for 
them and when the developed intelligence has become a safer 
guide. Although the milder and more elevated emotions 
serve an important purpose in even the highest levels of 
rational life, the more violent forms often become as danger- 
ous to a civilized being as they were necessary in primitive 
existence. Uncontrolled fear, anger, jealousy, or passionate 
animal love have no place in a law-abiding, intelligent life. 
Those who give way to them will find themselves in constant 
trouble—if not in jail. The primitive impulse to fight means 
an appeal to teeth and fists, but civilized conflict must be in 
organized armies, courts of law, or organization of competi- 
tive industries. The savage impelled by fear must run, 
scream, or hide; modern man appeals to the police. The say- 
age type of reaction to a rushing elephant is quite ineffective 
as a means for a pedestrian to avoid an automobile. Knowl- 
edge has largely eliminated blind fear and unreasoning rage. 
The prevalence of firearms and the resistless organization of 
government render primitive emotions helpless to accom- 
plish their original purposes. 
Conflicting emotional tendencies. Although in a primitive 
unreasoning existence the instinctive emotional action affords 
the best and perhaps the only means of preservation, even 
there it often proves woefully inadequate. Under some cir- 
cumstances safety lies in flight, in the face of danger of 
another sort the only protection is in hiding, under other 
circumstances in screaming or shouting, at other times in 
keeping perfectly still, again in climbing a tree, or perhaps
-P-A-G-E-248
232 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
in turning and fighting. Instinct has coupled each response 
with the situation for which it is adapted. But confronted 
with some new sort of danger, the creature often is helpless 
to choose one form of reaction to the exclusion of others, 
and the resulting emotional conflict produces a shaking of 
knees, a chattering of teeth, hair standing on end, cold sweat, 
an utterly helpless collapse, with no effective or useful action 
whatever. Instinctive emotions have not kept pace with the 
changes of modern life, so that some’such pitiful confusion 
and helplessness is the frequent outcome of the surrender to 
emotion of a civilized being. Indeed, it is precisely the use- 
lessness of such simple and direct forms of instinctive re- 
sponse in the utterly changed conditions of our civilized life 
that gives rise to our most intense emotional disturbances. 
So long as the sudden discharge of energy can find an outlet 
in effective action, the result is practically the same as 
though equally vigorous action had been directed by intelli- 
gence; but when the conflicting impulses are pulling in 
contrary directions they block each other, and unless intelli- 
gence can get control and direct an effective form of action, 
the pent-up emotions increase the confusion and helplessness. 
A human being is never quite so contemptible or seems so 
unworthy of being an intelligent creature as when in blind 
rage, uncontrolled fear, or helpless embarrassment, he writhes 
and flounders in miserable futility. 
Lange-James theory. From the preceding discussion it will 
be seen that an emotion is an automatic, more or less instinc- 
tive, response to a definite stimulus which sets it off. We do 
not see a lion, decide that it is dangerous, and become dis- 
turbed as a result of that judgment. The disturbance is im- 
mediate and follows directly from the original stimulus. 
Any judgment in the matter comes afterward, if at all. Ordi- 
narily if we could but suppress the emotion until we can 
reason upon the situation, the emotion would never arise,
-P-A-G-E-249
EMOTIONS 233 
certainly not the conflicting, paralyzing sort of emotional 
disturbance. As James has said, we do not cry because we 
are sorry, but we are sorry because we cry. We do not 
scream and tremble because we are frightened; we are 
frightened because we scream and tremble. The physical 
reaction (that is, the crying, screaming, and trembling) is 
immediate and automatic, like the action of a nickel-in-the- 
slot machine, and we become conscious of our own disturbed 
state and of the cause of it at practically the same instant. 
This is better appreciated when we recall our own embar- 
rassment after we have given way to a startled scream, a fit 
of anger, or unseemly laughter. Sometimes we are heartily 
ashamed of ourselves and wonder why we did it. The reason 
is, we did not do it; it did itself. The scream, the jump, the 
weeping, or other display of emotion had got under way 
before thinking started. 
ontrol of emotions. Our practical problem—as it is with 
all instinctive tendencies, with habits, and with the mildly 
emotional affective element—is to make our emotions our 
helpful servants and to keep them from getting the mastery. 
They are subject to training through the supremacy of the 
intelligence. The habit of acting from intelligence rather 
than from emotion is the chief distinguishing mark of a 
civilized and developed being. Self-mastery is the prime 
mark of higher manhood and womanhood. “He that ruleth 
himself is greater than he that taketh a city.” The conquest 
of anger, hatred, prejudice, passion, and selfishness is the 
essence of Christian spirit. An American statesman has de- 
fined civilization as the progressive conquest of fear. The 
method of accomplishing this mastery of the primitive self 
through the higher gifts of our guiding intelligence is simply 
the method of all habit formation. We must first set clearly 
before our minds the desirability of acting from thought, 
principle, and purpose rather than from impulse; then we
-P-A-G-E-250
234 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
must practice it persistently, faithfully, and without excep-: 
tion. We must train ourselves to “think before we act.” 
Their transformation. But control of the emotions should 
by no means result in a hard, cold, or unfeeling personality. 
Much of the brightness, sweetness, and richness of life would 
be lost if we were to become wholly unemotional. A life that 
is altogether cold and calculating may be more efficient for 
some purposes, but it is joyless and hardly worth the living. 
The ideal is to “sublimate” the emotional impulses; that is, 
to refine and elevate them. Instead of mere physical re- 
sponses to definite situations we must encourage those fine 
impulses, abiding purposes, and high ideals which impel men 
and women to the best things of life. It is not desirable to 
crush out the emotion entirely, but to redirect it into higher 
and better channels, to transform it into an inspiration to 
noble living. One should not cease to hate, but he should 
learn to hate evil, filth, and meanness. Fear, instead of being 
a mean, cowardly trait, may be elevated to a beautiful spirit 
of respect for things worthy, deference to superior wisdom 
and worth, reverence for things pure and holy, a fear to do 
evil, “the fear of God.” The fighting impulse is as much 
needed in modern civilized life as in the primitive, but the 
higher need is for this fighting impulse to overcome obstacles, 
to conquer one’s own evil tendencies, to vanquish difficulties 
in the way of wise and useful progress. It is a savage, childish 
thing to be ever ready to fight one’s playmates, to quarrel 
with one’s companions, to resort to fists to settle differences ; 
it is a noble thing to use all one’s skill and intelligence, all 
the resources of government and science, to fight the physi- 
cal, moral, and social diseases which afflict a people. A stu- 
dent has use for all his fighting energy in conquering the 
problems of his daily work. The sex impulses when they 
descend to a primitive form in a civilized community bring 
in their train untold sin, sorrow, and suffering but, subli-
-P-A-G-E-251
  EMOTIONS 235 
mated to fit the higher relations which civilization affords, 
they become the inspiration of chivalry, courtesy, all that is 
loveliest in home life, and much that is finest in music, 
literature, and art. 
Use and abuse of emotions. The function of emotions 
being to bring about action, the most common and usually 
the most effective means of arousing people to action is by 
means of an appeal to emotions. The cold intellectual deci- 
sion as to what ought to be done does not by any means get 
it done. The emotional energizing force is ordinarily a large 
factor in the actual results. On the other hand, under the 
influence of too great emotional stimulation people do many 
things they would never consent to do under the direction of 
calm intelligence. In the “heat of argument” the attitude 
of contention looses emotional energy; and as this grows 
stronger it supplants judgment and reason, it arouses a cor- 
responding emotional attitude in the antagonist, and instead 
of an appeal to reason, which is the essence of argument, the 
whole becomes a mere conflict of blind impulses and leads to 
nothing more than sheer antagonism. Shrewd boxers and 
prize-fighters know that if one can madden his opponent he 
is an easy winner, and the basest means are sometimes re- 
sorted to to make blind wrath supplant the antagonist’s intel- 
ligence. In all sorts of contests ‘“‘a cool head” is an asset no 
less important than great skill. Every baseball “fan” knows 
the disastrous results of getting the pitcher “rattled.” 
“Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.” The 
really “good fighter” in any race for victory is one who can 
intensely desire success, who never entertains discourage- 
ment or other enfeebling emotions, and who never for a 
moment loses the supremacy of his judgment. Because 
emotions get action rather than judgment, political argu- 
ments are commonly addressed to prejudices and the intense 
feelings. Just here is the great strength of the social and in-  
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
dustrial “agitator.” The untrained mind does not easily follow 
complex reasoning, but emotions are readily aroused in even 
the very ignorant. From what has been said it should by no 
means be concluded that an emotional appeal is in itself bad 
or undesirable. Like other primitive forms of mental activ- 
ity, emotions are neither good nor bad: they are forces which 
may be utilized either for good or for bad. Intelligence must 
determine in what direction and how far they shall have 
sway. The noblest purposes as well as the basest are made 
effective by appeal to the emotions. It was the appeal to 
patriotism, loyalty, and sympathy for the oppressed that 
aroused the American people to give freely of their means 
and to make all manner of sacrifices during the World War 
and after it. The great “drives” for funds for various splen- 
did causes have owed their success to the emotional character 
of the appeal. The power of the religious revivalist is in the 
fact that he is skillful in reaching the emotions of his 
hearers. His purpose is to bring them to a point of decision, 
and hence the emotional appeal is the effective one. But even 
these exalted emotions may be excessive and actually injuri- 
ous if not supported and restrained by judgment. Religious 
enthusiasm has led to emotional excesses, to insanity, and 
to other psychological results as far as possible from the true 
religious aim and character. Patriotism may be aroused to 
fanatical partisanship and bitter hatred. 
Emotional drama and literature. Normally, then, the emo- 
tions are a means to an end. They should result in conduct. 
Few things are more hurtful to strength of character and the 
power of achievement than the constant stimulation of emo- 
tional states which lead to nothing. Emotional literature and 
the drama (including motion pictures) are valued because 
of their power to arouse these emotional states. Within cer- 
tain limits the mere pleasure of this stimulation is adequate 
justification for it. Whatever adds to the richness and joy of 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
  
EMOTIONS 237 
living is to that extent good and worth while. But the stirring 
up of one’s anger against the villain, admiration for the 
courage and honor of the hero, sympathy for the wronged 
and oppressed, should leave its traces in the nervous system 
in such form that when like conditions arise in real life, there 
will be a greater readiness for and capacity for doing some- 
thing to defend the right or to suppress the wrong. Not only 
is fact often stranger than fiction, but, as Aristotle pointed 
out centuries before the time of Christ, good drama is truer 
than history. By this he meant that drama should depict 
the natural and normal effects of conditions, impulses, and 
traits of character as they would be if allowed to work out to 
their logical and natural conclusions; while in history, acci- 
dents and influences which could not be foreseen constantly 
intrude to upset the normal effects of the causes which we 
attempt to trace. Good drama and fiction, then, untangle 
the confused threads of actual life and seek to arouse in the 
reader or hearer the right emotional attitude toward the 
moral and social conditions which are affecting society, to 
the end that he may react intelligently and effectively toward 
these conditions. In so doing they are educative in the 
highest and best sense. But drama and fiction may be bad. 
They may stir up emotions or they may associate them in 
ways which have no place in clean and efficient character. 
Much that appears upon the stage or is published as litera- 
ture is wholly untrue to psychological or social fact. Much 
of it is merely an overemphasizing of the most unwholesome 
aspects of life and society. To allow oneself to be stirred by 
the foul and morbid when no helpful constructive action is 
to result is just to destroy the purity and beauty of life 
without any compensating advantage. Even to arouse good 
motives incessantly, with no reaction but sighing, crying, 
wishing, and dreaming, is to make one’s character sickly 
sentimental. It is not a thing to be ashamed of, but rather
-P-A-G-E-254
  238 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
to be proud of, that one is tender-hearted, easily moved to 
tears, indignation, or laughter, provided that on occasion 
one is also moved to effective conduct; but deliberately or 
weakly to permit the endless arousing of emotions, only to 
let them dissipate into useless sighing, is to destroy one’s 
power of decisive action, and this should be as much a matter 
of shame as the hardest callousness. 
Moods and dispositions. Some persons are too much 
swayed and dominated by their emotions. They are emo- 
tional people. Qthers are always seeking the superficial 
tickling of their emotions for the pleasure of shallow thrills, 
but with no effective outlet to useful action. They are 
merely sentimental. Others easily become affected by cer- 
tain emotions for longer periods of time. For example, one 
becomes angry, and instead of the anger working itself out 
on its legitimate original object, it takes possession of him 
and finds expression in everything he does. He “takes it 
out” on anything and everything. Again, he is sad, and for 
a time all his world is dark and dreary. Something pleases 
him, and immediately everything affords him joy. These are 
moody people, and the mood of the day colors every experi- 
ence while it lasts. All of us doubtless are more or less emo- 
tional, more or less sentimental, and more or less moody. 
Our judgment is given us to control these more primitive 
impulses, and the wisely ordered life keeps a careful check 
and balance on these emotional states. A slave to emotions is 
the helpless tool and plaything of whosoever chooses to play 
upon him; he is driven about by the winds and waves of 
chance; he is sorely buffeted by adversity and whirled off his 
feet by good fortune. He is not the master of himself. When- 
ever one mood is permitted to hold sway for a very long time, 
it tends to become habitual. It becomes one’s permanent and 
perhaps unchangeable emotional character; it becomes a 
disposition. We all know many people of many dispositions
-P-A-G-E-255
  
EMOTIONS 239 
— grouchy,” suspicious, selfish, sullen, quarrelsome, gentle, 
kindly, friendly, brave, generous, happy. As each of us con- 
trols his own moods, so he can determine his disposition—not 
easily, perhaps, but certainly subject to his own choice, pro- 
vided he chooses early and exerts enough of will and deter- 
mination in smothering the emotions he would not have 
dominate and in acting upon those he’ would crystallize into 
his disposition.

  CHAPTER XVII 
THE WHOLE MIND 
“Fearfully and wonderfully made.” We have completed 
our review of the mental functions, Each topic we have 
briefly considered is worthy of extended study. Many books 
have been written on them separately and collectively and 
many more will be, and yet the story will not be fully told. 
The deeper we search into the workings of our own minds, 
the more the marvel of it all grows upon us. If we are “fear- 
fully and wonderfully made” as to our physical bodies, in 
which we are but more perfect animals, still more sublime is 
the mystery of mind, in which mankind stands alone among 
created beings. “Know then thyself, . . . The proper study 
of mankind is man.” Greater than the marvel of any of the 
particular forms of mind activity is the wonderful unity and 
harmony of them all. The physical body has numerous dis- 
tinct organs, each highly specialized for its own peculiar task. 
Consciousness, or the mind, resident in the nervous system, 
has no parts, but functions as a whole in countless different 
ways. It has its impulses, habits, sensations, percepts, con- 
cepts, images, emotions, and the like, and countless millions 
of each, with no two identically alike. All these processes are 
interdependent ; they merge into each other and overlap end- 
lessly. For purposes of discussion the classification we have 
followed is ordinarily used, but there are many variations in 
divisions and terms used which are equally good. Each head 
might be divided into many subheads, and these subdivided 
again; or if one’s purpose were better served thereby, all 
24 
i - 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
might be grouped into two, three, or four main heads. No 
human mind can say dogmatically just how many forms of 
mental processes are involved in its own workings. One may 
count the bones but not the habits or impulses. 
The will. It was formerly the custom of psychologists to 
classify mental processes under three great heads: knowing, 
feeling, and willing. According to their analysis the “know- 
ing faculty” consisted of all the intellectual processes in- 
cluding sensation and perception, the organization of these 
into concepts, judgment and reason, together with memory, 
imagination, and attention. The affective element and emo- 
tions were thought of as separate processes rather than 
as mere qualities of the others, and made up the “feeling 
faculty.” The will, or volition, was held to mean “the power 
to determine,” or, more fully, “the determination of the 
mind to do or not to do something which we conceive to be in 
our power.” Certainly this power to decide upon and deter- 
mine our own conduct is supremely important in the affairs 
of mind and life. What good otherwise are all our knowl- 
edge, skill, desires, and impulses? What profits it that we 
know what is right if we cannot bring ourselves to do it? 
Why should we desire at all if we have no power of decision 
to bring our desires to pass? What use to judge what our 
conduct should be if we are helpless to real-ize these judg- 
ments in what we do. 
Kant on “good will.” Immanuel Kant, one of the world’s 
greatest philosophers, wrote these memorable words: 
Nothing in the whole world, or even outside of the world, can 
possibly be regarded as good without limitation except a good will. 
No doubt it is a good and desirable thing to have intelligence, sagac- 
ity, judgment, and other intellectual gifts, by whatever name they 
may be called; it is also good and desirable in many respects to 
possess by nature such qualities as courage, resolution, and per- 
severance; but all these gifts of nature may be in the highest
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE WHOLE MIND 243 
degree pernicious and hurtful, if the will which directs them, or 
what is called the character, is not itself good. The same thing 
applies to gifts of fortune. Power, wealth, honor, even good health, 
and that general well-being and contentment with one’s lot which we 
call happiness, give rise to pride and not infrequently to insolence, 
if a man’s will is not good; nor can a reflective and impartial specta- 
tor ever look with satisfaction upon the unbroken prosperity of_a 
man who is destitute of the ornament of a pure and good will, A 
good will would therefore seem to be the indispensable condition 
without which no one is even worthy to be happy. 
A man’s will is good, not because the consequences which flow 
from it are good, nor because it is capable of attaining the ends 
which it seeks, but it is good in itself, or because it wills the good. 
By a good will is not meant mere well-wishing ; it consists in a reso- 
lute employment of all the means within one’s reach, and its intrinsic 
value is in no way increased by success or lessened by failure. 
The strong will. We are accustomed to think of the will 
as some mysterious power which enables us to do those 
things which run counter to our inclination; as a sort of 
directing divinity within us which acts as a higher court of 
appeal when desire and duty conflict. It is by force of will 
that we hold ourselves to our appointed tasks when they 
become wearying and burdensome. It is by “sheer will 
power” that we push on toward the goal of our purposes 
when strength ebbs from the physical frame, when fatigue or 
disease claims us as its prey. The man of strong will is one 
who can and does overcome obstacles within and without 
and accomplishes his ends despite them all. He knows what 
he wants, and what he wants he gets. The man of strong 
will is not necessarily the man of good will. He is likely to be 
selfish in his purposes; he may ruthlessly destroy others in 
his unswerving tenacity of purpose. He may be cold and 
heartless and void of any high principle. We rightly think of 
the man who combines a strong will and kindly unselfish 
aims in life as the man of greatest value to society.

  244 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
The weak will. On the other hand, the man of weak will 
is futile and ineffective. He may mean well, but he does not 
count when it comes to getting things done. He is hesitating, 
uncertain, and we know not where to place him. He is easily 
diverted from his purposes and changes with every new in- 
fluence that comes into his life. He may be always intending 
something worth while, but his intentions fail to get them- 
selves into realities. He cannot withstand temptation and is 
easily led astray by evil companions. He may know what is 
right and he may mean to do it, he may desire the right most 
earnestly and despise himself most intensely for his, con- 
stant failures, but somehow he continues to fail. 
What is the will? What then, psychologically, is this 
power of will, this commander in chief of the forces of the 
mind? What and where is this unseen, secret master before 
whom all the powers of mind and body must yield, to whom 
all must do obeisance? We can best discover it by noting 
carefully where it is not. “A man athirst,” says Reid, in 
illustration, “has a strong desire to drink.” He well knows 
that he should not, but Aabit is stronger than judgment, and 
he yields. Or, the desire to satisfy the physical longing is 
more powerful than the habit of obedience to reason. Or, it 
may be that he but vaguely understands the danger while 
very vividly feeling the urge of appetite. If he refuse, it is 
because he has a vivid image of the peril that lurks in the 
practice ; because he has reasoned out the better way and has 
the power to follow it; because he remembers the conse- 
quences ; because he has a purpose upon which he can hold 
his attention, to the exclusion of the temptation ; because his 
habits conform to refusal rather than to yielding; because 
his likes are in line with refusal, and he dislikes the associa- 
tions which draw him in the opposite direction; because the 
powerful emotional influences pull him away rather than 
toward the evil tendency. If his habits, his knowledge, his
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE WHOLE MIND 245 
judgment and reason, his imagery of the consequences, his 
attention to the decisions he has made, his interests, his likes 
and dislikes, and his emotional forces are all opposed to his 
taking the drink, there is no possible doubt but that he will 
refuse without hesitation or debate. If all these faculties, or 
as many of them as are called into activity on the occasion, 
are favorable to the drink, he will yield with as little hesita- 
tion; if, however, some are favorable and others oppose, 
there will ensue more or less of conflict, with victory on the 
side of the stronger combination. Instinct is always playing 
an important part and is often the deciding factor. But in- 
stincts, you will recall, consist in more or less indefinite 
inherited tendencies. These are organized through experience 
and education and take their part in character or will as 
habits, likes and dislikes, and emotions. 
“The whole mind active.” Thus the determining factor in 
conduct is not some new, psychological element, but the 
combination and balance of them all. ‘The whole mind 
active—this is will” is the classic statement of Angell. The 
whole mind active, unified, harmonious, and concentrated 
upon a single purpose—this is a strong will. The mind 
divided, at conflict with itself, partly undeveloped or partly 
inactive—this is a will enfeebled, weak, and incapable of 
achievement. Ignorance is the cause of one man’s ineffi- 
ciency; lack of purpose spells failure for another; inability 
to judge quickly or to reason to a conclusion makes another 
vacillating and undecided; harmful habits hamper another, 
or the lack of habits that make for success; another is in- 
effective for lack of concentration and sustained attention to 
those things by which he must win; another is enfeebled 
because he likes too much the things that interfere or cannot 
learn to like the things that help; another is too impulsive 
and emotional, bungling his efforts because of excitement or 
drawn away from his purpose by impulses foreign to them;
-P-A-G-E-262
  246 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
or perhaps failure is due to sheer lack of physical strength to 
put purposes into effect. Great strength in some elements 
may overcome the handicap of weakness in another, but 
more commonly it is the weakness of some element that 
renders futile all the splendid possibilities of the others, that 
proves the “limiting factor” in success. It is the well- 
rounded, balanced, harmonious development of all one’s 
powers that constitutes the strong, good will which, as Kant 
says, is the one thing that is good in itself without reference 
to any other thing. ; 
Kant—revised. In the light of a more modern psychology 
we need have no quarrel with the great Kant as to the 
supreme and unconditional importance of a good will. The 
various elements which go to make it up are in themselves 
good only as they contribute to the harmony and goodness 
of the whole. They “may be in the highest degree pernicious 
and hurtful” if they are misdirected through the lack of 
balance and unity. The gifts of fortune often do more harm 
than good when their possessor is lacking in judgment, in 
good habits, in knowledge, in right impulses, or in other 
elements of good and well-balanced character. Neither is will 
to be judged by the consequences which an uncontrollable 
fate may impose upon one, for a complete, well-balanced, 
and well-developed will is the best possible human agency 
for controlling fate. With this equipment, if one is not the 
master of his destiny the fault is not his; lacking it, one is 
responsible in just that degree in which he might have con- 
trolled destiny by first attaining his own completeness. 
Power of decision. Inability to reach a decision promptly 
and positively is not infrequently the limiting factor in the 
power of will. It may be due to a feeling that all the data 
have not been considered and a fear of jumping to a hasty 
conclusion. This is a wise precaution in matters of opinion 
and so long as it is possible to secure further data. But inde- 
 
-P-A-G-E-263
  
THE WHOLE MIND 247 
cision easily becomes a habit, and its victim hesitates to 
decide when it is obvious that nothing can be gained by 
delay. When one choice is as good as another, the important 
thing is to choose one or the other and go ahead. It is often 
quite immaterial which is taken. Even the poorer choice 
may at least show that it is wrong, while indecision ac- 
complishes nothing whatever. Learn to determine quickly 
whether other knowledge is necessary. If so, get it; if not, 
weigh the data in hand. If the two sides balance equally, 
choose one—it matters not how. Take the nearest one or 
toss a coin, but decide, and then do not hesitate or waver. 
Purpose the heart of will. A strong will acts from an abid- 
ing purpose. This is some fundamental principle of conduct 
which serves as an immediate guide in all situations. Strict 
and unwavering honesty is such a purpose, and adherence to 
it stamps one’s character as strong and forceful. A definite 
ambition to accomplish some end is a purpose which may 
instantly change a wavering, useless personality to one that 
drives irresistibly toward its aim, overcoming obstacles, util- 
izing every situation, and bending all one’s own energies, 
as well as all means within reach, to its certain accomplish- 
ment. If that guiding principle or that definite ambition be 
one that is good from a moral or social point of view, the 
will is not only strong, but it is a good will. If it be a 
morally or socially evil purpose, such as revenge, vindictive 
hatred, the satisfaction of lust or greed, or if it be an ambi- 
tion for wealth or power as a means of mere selfish aggran- 
dizement, that will, however strong, is an evil will. Sooner 
or later it must conflict with the will of others and with the 
stronger will of society, and be overcome. One’s will can 
be no better than his controlling purpose, no stronger than 
his principles and aims, no more enduring than his ambitions. 
Character. The term “character” is derived from a Greek 
word which means a mark engraved, and hence it refers to 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
  248 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
those traits or qualities which are firmly fixed. The hesitat- 
ing, wavering, uncertain, unreliable individual is said to lack 
character. He lacks purpose, and hence he lacks will. “A 
double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.” “For he 
that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind 
and tossed.” Such an one may not expect that others will 
repose confidence or trust in him. They do not know what 
to expect from him. They cannot count on him. He cannot 
be a leader, for others will not follow. He cannot accomplish 
things by himself, for his efforts lack consistency and per- 
sistency. The man or woman without character is a zero 
in the world’s work and affairs. The person of bad character 
may be strong and consistent, but his purpose and aims are 
hostile to the interests of society or the inevitable laws of 
nature, and in the end he must lose in the unequal contest. 
On the other hand, a character that is strong and good, a 
strong will guided by a good purpose, is an achievement of 
priceless worth both to the possessor and to society. Such an 
one can lead, for the world has confidence in the fixity as well 
as the goodness of his purposes and in his ability to bring 
them to pass. He is trusted. Men know where to place him; 
they follow and obey. Such are the leaders and masters of 
men whose power does not wane with the first shift of the 
winds of adversity. It is true that the purposes of the world’s 
noblest characters have sometimes been too high for the 
appreciation of an ignorant populace; they are often mis- 
understood and subjected to suspicion. In its fickle igno- 
rance and lack of character a mob easily follows after leaders 
of meaner purpose. True leaders may even be burned at the 
stake or crucified, but even so their purposes and characters 
lead on when they are gone. Such have been the world’s 
greatest reformers, because their aims were far ahead of the 
world in which they lived. Great characters are not burned 
nor buried. But whether we think of world reformers or of 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  THE WHOLE MIND 249 
ordinary good citizens, all achievements worth while rest 
upon the best of all achievements—a good character. 
Character an achievement. We speak of character as an 
achievement advisedly. For characters do not happen to us. 
They are not bestowed upon us. Each of us must build his 
own. He is building it, such as it is, whether he will or not, 
every hour and every day of his waking life. He builds it bit 
by bit as he fixes his habits, as he gathers and organizes his 
knowledge, as he learns to control his attention, as he makes 
use of his memory and entertains his imagery, as he develops 
and directs his interests and desires, as he controls and subli- 
mates his emotions, as he forms his judgments and reasons 
out his decisions, by every thought and every act, for it is 
of just such stuff as these that will and character are formed. 
Character-building is the most important business of life. It 
is the foundation of all achievement and success. It is the 
aim of all learning and’ educative discipline. The building 
of a home, of a business, of a fortune, of a reputation, 
these are the tasks of a lifetime; but a well-built, effective, 
and enduring character is the foundation upon which all of 
them must rest if they are to withstand the strain of time 
and adversity. 
Unity. From chapter to chapter we have seen how the 
several elements which constitute character are formed. 
Here we see that character, like a machine which is only as 
strong as its weakest part, gets its strength from the com- 
bined effectiveness of every element united into one harmoni- 
ous whole. Character is not merely the sum of all its parts; 
it is the unity and harmony of the whole. This unity is 
achieved only by the supremacy of guiding principles suffi- 
ciently strong to dominate and subordinate to their purposes 
the formation of habits, physical and mental, the develop- 
ment of interests, and the direction of every impulse. Will 
is the whole mind activity. Character is the sum of all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
  250 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
traits and abilities which, when in action, constitute the will. 
Character is what one is. It is all that one is. 
Personality. Like will and character, the term “person- 
ality” is used to name a sum total of achievements. What 
is it that makes an attractive personality but good habits, 
refined interests, kindly impulses, intelligence, and congenial 
thinking, and the sort of attitudes and conduct to which 
these give rise? Whatever one seeks to have as his person- 
ality he can attain just in so far as he can identify the 
psychological ingredients, and then develop and fix them into 
his character by the sort of exercise which is necessary for 
the development of each. Certainly the influence of home 
environment, of the example of those whom we early learn 
to imitate, of the conditions of our work and play, of our 
opportunities for education and refinement,—these and a 
thousand other influences tremendously affect the degree of 
difficulty one encounters in establishing habits of neatness, 
of taste in matters of dress, of gracious ways, of vivacious 
conversation, of easy dignity in every sort of presence, and 
other superficial attainments so much to be admired in one’s 
personality. But greater difficulties demand only greater 
strength of will, more of fixed purpose and character; and 
the more one has had to overcome in the development of his 
personality, the more of will and character he has developed 
in the process. In the problem of the growth of the whole 
character, will, or personality we have the same great law of 
growth that we have found true in the development of each of 
the elements, as it is true in things physical, financial, politi- 
cal and everywhere else,—“ to him that hath shall be given,” 
and it is given in proportion to what one has and not to what 
he lacks. Will, character, personality—we use these words 
with slightly different meanings, but at bottom they are the 
same. Each is the sum of all those physical and mental 
qualities that make one what he is. Each is the accumulated
-P-A-G-E-267
THE WHOLE MIND 251 
result of all that he has done and is modified from day to 
day by what he is doing. Each is a collective name for all 
those capacities which determine what he will be able to do. 
Ideals. The central, unifying force in character, as in will 
and personality, is one’s ideal. An ideal is an idea which one 
desires to realize, which has become one’s plan and purpose. 
Instead of being a mere impersonal thought about some- 
thing, it is an aim which guides and stimulates all that one 
does. It is the objective toward which conduct is directed. 
Without an ideal in life one is a mere drifter, turning this 
way and that with the winds and currents of chance, but 
making no definite and positive progress in any direction. 
It is not surprising that one who is going nowhere in particu- 
lar arrives nowhere in particular. One may be possessed of 
good habits, abundant knowledge, excellent judgment, lofty 
impulses, power of sustained attention, and every mental and 
physical quality essential to success, and yet count as a zero 
in the world’s affairs, taking orders from and doing routine 
work for one who is in most respects his inferior. His ineffi- 
ciency is due to having no great dominating purpose to focus 
toward a single point all his splendid abilities. On the other 
hand, many an inferior man has become a great leader and 
master of men and destinies because one great purpose was 
so powerful and appealing that every ounce of available 
energy was incessantly directed toward it. Have a high ideal 
in all you do. Set for yourself a worthy standard of achieve- 
ment from day to day and month to month, and drive with 
all your force to attain it. By so doing you unshackle capaci- 
ties you little dreamed that you possessed. Set for your- 
self the ideal of achievement and standing that you desire 
at the end of your college course, at the end of a year: an 
ideal of scholastic attainment, of literary prominence, of 
athletic success, or of leadership. The clarity and vividness 
of the ideal will give you confidence in your capacity to 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  
  252 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
attain it, and this confidence is in itself a large factor in the 
capacity. Let nothing swerve you from your determination. 
You will meet with many successes along the way that you 
had not planned for. Honors and places of trust are con- 
stantly coming unsought to those who have developed the 
power of accomplishment in the effort to attain the ideals 
they have set for themselves. But these incidental successes 
may contribute to your ultimate ideal or they may sadly 
interfere with it. Your judgment must guard you against se- 
ductive distractions as it must put aside a thousand other 
things on the way to success. Decide early on your ideal of 
a life career, and drive for it with every bit of energy and 
ability you can master. Larger experience and better judg- 
ment may later modify that ideal, refine it, enlarge it, exalt 
it. It is to be hoped they will. But meantime you have been 
developing power through the unity of character and force of 
will you have been exercising. You have not only developed 
the power to achieve your aim but also the power to substi- 
tute a better one for it and to achieve that one as well. 
Standards of attainment. But big things are made up of 
little ones. The long race is the sum of many steps. If you 
would have a high ideal for life as a whole, you must have a 
high ideal for each of its parts. If you would attain your 
high ambition for ultimate success, you must set a high 
standard for each of the tasks by which it is reached. There 
is no better way to increase your capacity in any line of 
endeavor than to set for yourself a definite standard of 
achievement in every task and then bend every energy 
toward reaching that standard. One should always “do his 
best,” but that best will be a great deal better if it is a 
definitely determined ideal both as to quantity and quality 
of attainment. Competition is the means of releasing unsus- 
pected abilities. Know just what your best competitor can 
do, and then do a little better. Know just what your own
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE WHOLE MIND 253 
best is, and then excel it. The only way continuously to 
increase your capacity is by always doing a little better 
than your best. Standards are ideals put into measurable 
form. They are the steps by which we climb to higher 
achievement. Only by these may we rise to the greatest 
heights of will, character, and success. 
EXERCISES 
1. Write definitions of ideal, purpose, will, character, personality. 
2. Write a list of ten habits which you regard as essential to a 
strong will; five habits which you believe would prevent the devel- 
opment of a strong will. 
8. *Grade yourself A (good), B (medium), or C (poor) on 
each of the desirable habits listed under the preceding question. 
4, *Prepare a brief written statement as to how you could 
develop those necessary habits which you have graded C. 
5. *Of the objectionable habits listed under Exercise 2, indicate 
those which you have and how you can overcome them. 
6. List ten things which it is important to a strong will that one 
should strongly desire; five desires which are harmful to a strong will. 
7. *Grade yourself on these desires and indicate how you can 
eliminate the objectionable ones and attain the helpful ones. 
8. Study several of the most successful and capable persons you 
know personally and endeavor to state the dominating purpose 
which accounts for the success of each. If practicable ask them. 
9. Similarly state the dominant purpose in the lives of several 
characters in history, biography, or literature. 
10. Can you find any persons within your acquaintance or in 
literature who seem to have all the elements of success except a 
strong purpose ? 
11. *Formulate in writing the central purpose upon which you are 
depending to make your own life a success. When thus stated in 
writing, do you feel that this purpose is definite enough to be a 
strong element in will power? Is it worthy to be the central aim 
of your life? Is it supported by strong desire and emotional force ?

  CHAPTER XVIII 
THE DISORGANIZED MIND 
Dissociation. Unity, organization, connecting up, is the 
key to the development of the normal mind and of all its 
powers; so disunity, disorganization, disconnecting, explains 
all that can be explained of the abnormal. There are 
conditions under which certain areas of the nervous system 
are closed to activity while others continue to function. 
Paralysis may affect almost any of the sensory or motor 
areas, resulting in loss of sensitivity or motor control of the 
part affected. Likewise the association areas may be tem- 
porarily or permanently incapacitated by various causes and 
in a bewildering variety of abnormal effects. Among the 
causes are inherited defects, certain transmitted or acquired 
diseases, the effects of alcohol and drugs, injuries, and shocks. 
The effects range all the way from intoxication and hysteria 
to the many and pitiful forms of incurable insanity. One 
may lose the memory of his own name and identity (am- 
nesia), yet retain more or less perfectly his knowledge of 
language, literature, mathematics, and the skills of his occu- 
pation. In the various forms of aphasia one may lose the 
power of articulating words or of understanding spoken 
words or of writing words or of reading them. One’s moral 
character, disposition, or temperament may be utterly 
changed by a drug or by the pressure of a clot of blood upon 
the brain. Sanity is the normal functioning and balance of 
the whole brain, and insanity is due to the failure of some 
portion of it to function, The present chapter seeks to give 
256  
-P-A-G-E-273
  THE DISORGANIZED MIND 257 
some explanation of a few of the more notable forms of 
partial or dissociated mental activity. 
The subconscious mind. Much has been said of late years 
about what is called the subconscious mind—so much, in- 
deed, that many people are coming to regard it as some sort 
of mystic second personality or ghostly other-self residing 
within the secret recesses of the brain and domineering with 
a relentless and irresponsible fatality over our better selves. 
While we have carefully avoided using the term, we have 
been dealing with many facts of the subconscious from 
the very beginning of our discussion. Since mind is con- 
sciousness, it is rather a contradiction of terms to speak of 
a mind or a part of mind as being not conscious—whether 
subconscious or unconscious. So far as any part of ourselves 
is not conscious it is not mind. Nevertheless, every reader is 
perfectly aware that at any given instant his mind is active 
at but one point of all the possible points at which it might 
be active. This is the point of attention. Meanwhile, every 
- experience of the past and much of the story of our ancestry 
are recorded in the synaptic pathways of the cerebrum. All 
our instincts, habits, knowledge, concepts, interests, and pur- 
poses are imprinted there. There are countless thousands of 
things that we know and can remember upon occasion, of 
which we are not thinking at any given instant. There are 
always hereditary impulses of more or less emotional char- 
acter, all sorts of instinctive tendencies, as well as acquired 
likes and dislikes, desires, interests, knowledge, purposes, and 
habits ad infinitum which go to make up the entire complex 
development of our mental character, quietly awaiting the 
cue which summons them to the stage of our conscious life. 
Not only is there but one item clearly in the center of atten- 
tive consciousness at any moment, but many of those count- 
less other items perhaps never do come clearly into our 
thought. Presumably they are all there as pathways in the
-P-A-G-E-274
  258 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
cerebrum, and into them the nerve current might at any 
moment be directed. Practically they are forgotten and un- 
used paths. Some of them are doubtless more or less posi- 
tively inhibited from functioning by the purposes, prejudices, 
or principles which we call our conscience. Some things we 
should not think about and do not, yet the paths are there 
and may give rise to some slight cerebral activity which tones 
our thought and feeling. Some pathways early formed, per- 
haps at a mother’s knee, have long ceased to play an active 
part in our thought, yet, quite unobserved, are serving to 
check our wayward impulses. There are always inherited 
and acquired tendencies which are affecting our thoughts and 
acts all unknown to us. This infinitely complex background 
of mind stuff, not quite in consciousness but perhaps never 
wholly out of it, is the field of the subconscious. Because it 
is subconscious no very definite account can be given of it 
and no definite statement can be made as to its precise effects. 
Except under pathological conditions a conscious idea or 
purpose is always more powerful than a subconscious one. 
To control the subconscious it is only necessary to bring out 
whatever we want from it into the sunlight of consciousness 
and think it into its true relations, or else so to clarify and 
invigorate our purposeful thinking that no subinfluences can 
count. The subconscious mind is not some dread, masterful 
superself, but a vague, irresponsible, shadowy subself and 
subject to the will, which is one’s real and normal self. 
Dreams. Many of the vital functions never cease while 
life continues. While we sleep the heart, lungs, and digestive 
organs keep up their unresting activity. Likewise the nerve 
energy continues to course through the cerebral pathways, 
giving us that irresponsible and weird sort of consciousness 
we all know in our dreams. Perhaps this cerebral activity 
never entirely ceases, and we may be dreaming all the time 
we are asleep. What we remember is only that which we
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE DISORGANIZED MIND 259 
have dreamed just before awaking, and hence this is all that 
we are aware of having dreamed. At times, though, relaxa- 
tion is so complete that our sleep seems to have been dream- 
less, and perhaps it is. The difference between dreams and 
waking thoughts is of the same sort as the difference between 
mind-wandering and clear thinking, only in greater degree. 
It is simply that in dreams cerebration goes on without a 
purpose, without any guiding problem, without control or 
check. Thinking of a rational sort is constantly checked and 
directed by the restrictions of coherence and the possibilities 
of time, place, and cause and effect. Daydreams ramble 
along without purpose or direction, but with sufficient ra- 
tional check to prevent utter absurdity. Real dreams have 
none of these controls. Whatever paths the energy happens 
to slip into are actuated into more or less vague conscious- 
ness. Probably dreams, like imagination, are limited to the 
paths that are in the cortex, and we cannot dream in terms 
of ideas that never entered the mind by some sensory channel. 
Of course in our dreams we make all sorts of combinations 
unknown to experience or to possibility, yet we utilize only 
the paths that exist. Dreams connect ideas in unaccount- 
able associations, and they take on affective or emotional 
qualities with as little rational cause. One may dream of 
saying a thing so funny as to be awakened by his own 
laughing—only to find his brilliant witticism absolutely 
meaningless and pointless. He may dream of composing a 
verse of surpassing beauty, but he may awake to find it sense- 
less twaddle. It is, however, not impossible or improbable 
that one may recall from his dreaming some suggestion which 
his waking mind may develop into a picture, a poem, or a 
musical composition. It is stated that many modern pro- 
ductions have had just such a dream origin—and it must be 
confessed that some of them are hard to account for other- 
wise. It is not uncommon to dream a dream within a dream,
-P-A-G-E-276
  260 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
to dream of waking and telling a dream, or to dream that 
a dream is repeated. There is probably no good reason why 
one might not dream the same thing several times in one 
or successive nights, but so far as it has been possible to 
check such experiences it has usually appeared that the repe- 
tition of it was a part of the dream idea. The theory that 
dreams are always expressive of some suppressed desire or 
wish is doubtless an unwarranted generalization from the 
perfectly obvious fact that such a wish might and sometimes 
does dominate one’s dreams. We all know that an unusual 
experience, a strong emotional state, a thing that we are 
worrying about, is very likely to affect our dreams at any 
time. This is simply because those particular pathways are 
left more or less irritable by our waking thoughts and anxi- 
eties, and the unguided cerebration of our sleep easily dis- 
turbs them. There is abundant evidence that problems have 
been solved, difficulties cleared up, and lost articles found 
by means of dreams. More than one person has dreamed of 
finding in a certain place a lost article about which he has 
been worrying, then waked and found it actually there. But 
how many have waked to find it not there? We dream so 
much that mere chance would lead us to expect to dream true 
occasionally in a lifetime. Often the dream is simply follow- 
ing the paths made by the waking thoughts, but which in the 
waking hours were confused by anxiety or prepossession. 
After long and anxious wrestling with a problem, not infre- 
quently we can best solve it by simply getting the mind off 
from it for a while. Coming back to it with the mind rested, 
it seems to solve itself. And so it might in a dream. How- 
ever, one would hardly recommend dreaming as a profitable 
or desirable way to solve problems or find lost articles. In- 
telligence is the gift we have for such purposes. 
Somnambulism. Walking, talking, and doing other things 
in one’s sleep is a weird business, for the reason that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
THE DISORGANIZED MIND 261 
person himself seems not to be there. It is as though an 
automobile without a driver were guiding itself along a busy 
street. If the dream activity is so vigorous or the motor 
nerves so easily aroused as to overcome their lethargic con- 
ditions, without at the same time arousing the upper levels 
of the cerebral process which constitute one’s waking per- 
sonality, it is entirely natural that more or less of mechanical 
physical activity should go on while consciousness continues 
to sleep. The somnambulist does not hear, feel, smell, or 
see anything not involved in what he is doing. As his reason 
is asleep, except for the dream he is enacting, so his sensory 
nerves are asleep so far as they are not directly employed. 
Hypnotism. Hypnotism is sleep artificially induced. It is 
no more supernatural or mysterious than are dreams. It is 
essentially the blocking of the normal sensory pathways: or 
those involved in our ordinary judgment and reasoning, while 
the lower and more mechanized connections continue to func- 
tion. The hypnotic state may take many different forms: 
it may be a mere hazy semiconsciousness; it may be anes- 
thetic insensitivity to any or all stimuli; it may take the form 
of a cataleptic state, in which the muscles assume a strange 
rigidity and remain indefinitely in any position in which they 
are placed; or it may be some somnambulistic state in which 
the will of the hypnotist has completely supplanted that of 
the subject. Because of the fact that the hypnotic state can 
be controlled and observed at will by others, it has been 
possible to study many aspects of this state as it has not 
been possible to study dreams or sleepwalking. Ordinarily 
the hypnotic subject does not see, hear, smell, or feel any- 
thing that is not suggested by the hypnétist. For this reason 
hypnotism is effectively used as an anesthetic in surgical 
operations. Likewise he cannot move or avoid moving except 
as directed by his control. Astonishing physical strength and 
endurance are possible while thus under the control of an-
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
other will, which reveals in a remarkably impressive manner 
that we seldom use our powers to the utmost while subject 
to the doubts and fears of our normal minds. Our own will 
power seems limited by a very slender faith in our own 
capacities. Similarly, hypnosis has disclosed surprising 
powers of sense discrimination. One can distinguish unerr- 
ingly among several sheets of blank paper which to the 
normal mind are identically alike. The fact that an intelli- 
gent person when hypnotized may believe an ordinary chair 
to be suddenly changed into a roaring lion, or an umbrella 
to be Julius Cesar, is due to the same lack of rational checks 
and controls which characterizes his dreams. In the absence 
of his own will, or personality, the hypnotic subject would 
merely sleep unless the will of another should take up the 
reins of his partial consciousness and direct his activity. 
This is done by suggestion. If you suggest to a normal person 
that he rise and close the door, he will do so unless some 
conflicting idea from his own consciousness inhibits the proc- 
ess. Without some contrary inhibition obedience is natural 
and unquestioned. The idea simply goes on to its natural 
outlet in action. The hypnotist brings about the sleeping 
condition by any one of many devices, at the same time es- 
tablishing his control over the subject so that as the latter 
surrenders his own will that of the hypnotist assumes direc- 
tion. It is essential that the subject narrow his mind to one 
point, which the experimenter controls, and that he believe 
in the power of the hypnotist. When the hypnosis is fully 
established, whatever the hypnotist suggests is believed or 
obeyed. Yet, as in dreams, only existent pathways can be 
utilized. A subject who had no knowledge of what a lion is 
like could not see one by being told that it was there. One 
may utilize his powers with tremendous concentration, but 
he cannot use powers which he never acquired. Deep-laid 
habit pathways cannot be ignored by a hypnotist any more
-P-A-G-E-279
THE DISORGANIZED MIND 263 
than they can by one’s normal will. Moral principles serve 
as a protective bulwark here as everywhere. In a public 
exhibition a subject who happened to be a total abstainer on 
principle readily responded to the suggestion that he was 
gathering flowers in a field, that he was up in a balloon, that 
he was in a boat at sea and was becoming seasick, but 
when offered imaginary liquor to relieve his indisposition he 
stubbornly refused it. 
Multiple personality. It occurs in repeated hypnotic states 
that the hypnotized person remembers distinctly what oc- 
curred in the previous hypnosis, though he remembers noth- 
ing of his normal life, nor does his normal mind remember 
anything of the hypnotic state. Thus a new personality may 
be built up, quite definitely organized within itself and its 
own experiences. This may be true either of a personality 
deliberately built up by a hypnotist in his subject, or it may 
occur quite without intent or plan. In the celebrated case of 
Miss Beauchamp, recorded by Dr. Prince, a secondary per- 
sonality had gradually developed in her nervous system, 
with its own memories, plans, interests, acquaintances, etc., 
all quite unlike those of the normal Miss Beauchamp. She 
learned of this other self by occasionally “coming to” in 
strange places and in company with total strangers, who 
seemed to expect her to know them quite well. This other 
self became a very decided and willful personality, full of 
mischief and wild pranks. She delighted in teasing and 
mortifying the sedate Miss Beauchamp. The latter never 
knew when she went to sleep where she might find herself on 
awaking if the other self should wake first. There developed 
a continued and bitter warfare for the permanent supremacy. 
Two souls, as it were, with but a single body, the permanent 
possession of which meant existence for one and nonexistence 
for the other. It was then that Dr. Prince took charge of the 
case, hypnotized both these selves and in time developed  
-P-A-G-E-280
  264 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
secondary, or hypnotic, selves for each, making four instead 
of two, and finally discovered a long-smothered original per- 
sonality the suppression of which had brought on all the 
trouble. Having found the original center of unity, all the 
others were brought into harmonious organization with it or 
were crushed out by means of this central will power. While 
this famous case is unusually complex, it shows rather clearly 
certain important facts. It is evident that there is nothing 
supernatural or mystic about the so-called alter ego, or other 
self. It is simply a group of cortical connections which, 
through some abnormal conditions, have got to functioning 
together, but have lost their connection with the normal 
personality. If this state continues or is often repeated, it 
may become a fixed habit and be impossible to overcome. 
The cure is in bridging over the separation and unifying the 
dual personality under the single will. Hypnotic suggestion 
is the usual means of accomplishing this when one has passed 
the possibility of self-control. But should it be necessary, 
this trusting another to probe the depths of one’s soul and 
to put together the pieces of one’s mind and character is a 
serious matter, and only the best and wisest of expert psycho- 
analysts should be permitted to take over one’s personality 
into their making. Persons of impulsive, changeable, or er- 
ratic character should have a care against encouraging this 
distressing dissociation of personality. The preventive is 
very simple and wholesome. It is simply to form the habit 
of thinking things through; to act with reflection and not on’ 
impulse; to use one’s best judgment at all times as the only 
safe guide for conduct; to do all things in the light of one’s 
balanced reason and conscience; to act always, as said the 
philosopher Spinoza, sub specie eternitatis—from the view- 
point of eternity. Then one need have no fear of a ghostly 
alter ego sneaking around to catch one asleep, of a Mr. Hyde 
who will some day supplant or destroy his Dr. Jekyll.
-P-A-G-E-281
  
THE DISORGANIZED MIND 265 
Normal and abnormal. Infinitely complex and varied are 
the associations of traits which make up a normal human 
personality. It is to be expected that the dissociations which 
mark abnormal conditions should have a wide range of varia- 
tion. No two are exactly alike among either normal or 
abnormal. Neither can any positive line be drawn between 
the sort of mental organization which is entitled to be called 
normal and sane and that which is not. The majority are 
easily placed, but along the border line of sanity even the 
experts cannot agree, as is evidenced by many attempts to 
settle the question in the courts. It is often cynically main- 
tained that sanity is merely being like the majority of people, 
and insanity is mostly in being different. Many geniuses 
have been regarded by the people as fools, while many fools 
are regarded by themselves as geniuses. 
Much madness is divinest sense 
To a discerning eye. 
Much sense, the starkest madness. 
*Tis the majority in this, as all, prevails. 
Assent and you are sane; 
Demur, you’re straightway dangerous 
And handled with a chain. 
Emity Dickinson 
The inmate of an asylum who conceives himself to be 
Napoleon may be no more mistaken in the fact than is the 
Napoleon of finance, who conceives unlimited wealth to be 
the supreme aim of life, or his gilded heir, who believes that 
happiness consists primarily in. spending that wealth. Is 
there not as truly a dissociation of personality in the case 
of an absent-minded philosopher who cannot remember the 
simplest practical errands as in that of the patient who can- 
not restrain his tendency to kill? But the judgment of so- 
ciety on the two cases will be very different. The line
-P-A-G-E-282
  266 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
between sanity and insanity, between the normal and the 
abnormal, like the line between right and wrong, between the 
moral and immoral, between the permissible and the intoler- 
able, whether in conduct, manners, dress, language, or govern- 
ment, is a matter of the judgment of society. It varies with 
place and time and circumstances. In the long run the judg- 
ment of society is right, because its judgment either makes 
right or makes the standard by which right is interpreted. 
The mystic and the supernatural. Because of the marvel- 
ous and mysterious complexity to which we have so often 
called attention, because of the fleeting and intangible char- 
acter of mind stuff, because no one has ever seen directly any 
mind but his own and has seen but little of that, because one 
can know another’s mind only through the conduct to which 
it is supposed to give rise,—for all these and other reasons 
no field of science is more subject to fantastic and super- 
stitious error than is psychology. Particularly in the field of 
the abnormal has popular thinking been constantly imposed 
upon by ignorance, superstition, and charlatanry. The stu- 
dent should know that an explanation explains by reducing 
the phenomena to recognized principles and not by ascrib- 
ing them to causes more mysterious and unknown than the 
phenomena themselves. By remembering always that the 
mind, so far as psychology knows, can make use only of 
cortical pathways which exist, and that these have all been 
established by the experiences of the race or of the individual, 
although infinitely modified and complicated by associations 
and dissociations, it should be clear that no human mind can 
have direct knowledge of what is wholly outside of human 
experience. We may believe implicitly in the reality of that 
infinity which is all about us and yet be very skeptical of one 
who claims to have penetrated it. We know that from primi- 
tive times pretenses of prophetic ‘foreknowledge, of magical 
insight and control, and of spirit communication have been
-P-A-G-E-283
  THE DISORGANIZED MIND 267 
among the commonest kinds of humbuggery and the sort to 
which people most easily respond. No thinking person 
should deny that which he cannot disprove, any more than 
he should assert that which he cannot know. But if there is 
any channel by which one mind can read another besides the 
channels of the senses, it is beyond the present realm of the 
psychologist. If there is any power by which a mortal mind 
can read the future, except by judgment based on the past, 
it is unknown to the science of psychology. If there is any 
means by which disembodied spirits can communicate to 
those which still exist in and by means of their nervous sys- 
tems—or any indication that they wish to do so—psychology 
has no knowledge or explanation to offer. Psychology deals 
only with the psychophysical—the mind in its relations to 
the body, the mind as that part of bodily existence which 
more effectively adjusts the individual to this physical and 
social world in which he lives. Beyond this is the realm of 
faith—and of fraud—but not of psychology. We know that 
hypnotic states assume an unlimited variety of forms in- 
duced in countless ways, with or without the aid of a hypno- 
tist. Suggestion is infinitely subtle and varied and may occur 
without the knowledge or intent of anyone. In abnormal 
states sense perception is often weirdly keen beyond any 
normal standards, or it may utterly fail to register. The 
authenticated records of marvelous suggestibility and sensi- 
tivity of hypnotic subjects, even where there is no intent to 
deceive, are sufficiently wonderful without ascribing super- 
natural explanations. (Countless instances of so-called mind ¢~ 
reading, telepathy, clairvoyance, and spirit communication 
have been explained by hypnotic suggestion and sensitivity, 
by mere chance and coincidence, by the irrepressible tendency 
even of scholarly people to generalize and believe farther than 
the facts go, and quite often by downright fraud.) He is truly 
wise and noble who lives and thinks from dayto day as he

268 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
would if all mankind could read his innermost thoughts, as 
he would wish his life and mind to be read through all 
eternity, as though his God read every thought and held 
him accountable therefor. He who presumes to have knowl- 
edge of the future or communication with departed spirits 
will bear watching, particularly if he has such secrets to sell 
for money. Guidance in the affairs of this life is to be found 
in the normal and not in the abnormal mind. Judgment, 
reason, and will are the means given for discovering the 
things we ought to know—not hypnotic sleep, irresponsible 
dreams, rappings, writings, ouija boards, or other communi- 
| cations ascribed to the sort of spirits which man’s imagina- 
tion has assumed his immortal part to be.

CHAPTER XIX 
THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY 
Psyche and the Logos. There was a princess in ancient 
Greek mythology so beautiful that she aroused the jealousy 
of the goddess of love, who sent Cupid to humiliate or de- 
stroy her. But the little god loved her when he saw her and 
carried her away to a fairy palace of delight. Her curiosity 
to look upon his face caused him to disappear. Then began 
her long and toilsome search for him through all the earth 
and the nether regions, her service as a slave in the palace 
of the goddess, and the performing of the impossible tasks 
laid upon her by that jealous divinity. But so surpassing 
were her loveliness and her faithfulness that she won over 
even the jealous Venus, was finally given a place among 
the gods, and united with the adoring Cupid. Thus did the 
Greeks symbolize the mind (which they identified with the 
soul), its attractive beauty, its curiosity, its ceaseless search- 
ing, its overcoming of insuperable difficulties, its conquest 
over jealousy and enmity by faithful service, its union with 
love and power, and its immortality among the gods. This 
beautiful princess who became a goddess was Psyche, and in 
her memory they called the mind psychos. Later on the more 
prosy philosophers among the Greeks, in their search for the 
ultimate explanation of the universe and the mystery of its 
creation, used the word logos to mean the divine creative 
reason, the formative mind which penetrates all things and is 
their active principle, the great First Cause or final Word. 
It is this expression which the Apostle John uses so effec- 
269
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
tively in introducing his Gospel to the philosophical Greeks 
in his first verse: “In the beginning was the Word, and the 
Word was with God, and the Word was God.” It is the com- 
bination of these two words of surpassing history and mean- 
ing, Psyche and Logos, the soul and its ultimate explanation, 
that has given us our word psychology. The mind’s study of 
itself has from that early dawn of recorded thought been a 
central problem of human speculation, and neither philoso- 
phy nor science has been able to get far from it. The watch- 
word of Socrates, “Know thyself,” has come down through 
the ages with ever-increasing force and significance. Yet only 
within the past half-century has psychology become truly a 
science. With the establishment of a laboratory and experi- 
mental methods of study by Wilhelm Wundt, and the popu- 
larizing of the scientific attitude in mental research by 
William James, psychology entered upon a period of tremen- 
dous development fraught with practical values beyond com- 
putation. There has been established a foundation of positive 
and demonstrable knowledge instead of speculative philoso- 
phy. So rich has been the production of psychological mate- 
rials that it has been rapidly subdivided into many specialized 
fields, each of which is making large contributions to human 
progress. No field of thought offers richer promise of interest 
to students or of service to humanity. 
Physiological psychology. This term indicates both the 
topics studied and the method pursued by an important 
group of psychological specialists. They have contributed 
all we know of the nature of nerve activity in its relation 
to thought and conduct. Their study of nerve pathways and 
the control of these through the development of synapses has 
corrected many misapprehensions of the speculative psy- 
chologists and given a character of scientific definiteness to 
what was formerly little more than a good guess. Their 
work is closely related to physiology and is carried on with '
-P-A-G-E-287
THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY 271 
elaborate laboratory equipment for experiment and scientific 
measurements. It is a laborious field, but fascinating to 
those who delve deeply into it, and peculiarly rich in its 
contributions to the general science. 
Animal psychology. It is astonishing to find how much 
has been discovered about the human mind by the study of 
the reactions of animals and the relations of these to their 
nervous systems. By studying just how much an animal with 
a given type of nervous system can learn from experience, it 
is pretty well established what part that phase of the nerve 
system plays in the learning of higher beings. Much has 
been determined in this way about the intelligence of ani- 
mals. Interesting answers have been made to such questions 
as to how ants and bees carry on their complex community 
life, how birds learn to build their nests and beavers to con- 
struct their wonderful dams, how fleas and mice can be 
taught to perform, parrots to talk, trained horses to spell, 
and dogs to take an important part in the affairs of human 
society. Do animals reason? Do dogs have imagery and 
concepts? Do they sometimes want to talk to us? 
Psychology of the abnormal. Dreams, hysteria, hypno- 
tism, double personality, lapse of memory, loss of the power 
of speech, insanity—here is a weird field of study, intensely 
interesting and productive of much knowledge that is being 
applied to the relief of suffering and the untangling of con- 
fused personalities. Here we have much to do with the re- 
markable power of suggestion in mental processes. When the 
ordinary checks and balances of mental life are dulled or 
put to sleep by drugs or hypnotism, ideas suggested by others 
or coming from unknown sources intrude themselves into the 
mental total and for the time being change utterly the will 
and character of the individual. One’s personality is changed ; 
he is another person in mind, though inhabiting the same 
body. This study not only throws much light on the psy-  
-P-A-G-E-288
  272 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
chology of normal states but shows the importance of pre- 
serving normal conditions by avoidance of drugs, excessive 
emotional disturbance, or other conditions which tend to dis- 
turb the balance and poise of the nervous system. This field 
of investigation also leads into those mystifying problems of 
the subconscious, of telepathy, thought transference, and 
spiritism. There is an unexplored continent here from which 
the pioneers are bringing back the most fabulous and fan- 
tastic tales. We may not be justified in either accepting or 
contradicting the many stories and explanations of these 
things told for popular consumption, but we may well believe 
that there is boundless opportunity for interest and profit- 
able discovery for those who will seriously and soberly 
explore this territory. 
Social psychology. A man in a mob is a different person 
from the same man acting alone. Mobs are constantly doing 
things which perhaps no one of the group would think of 
doing. A group of men acting together as an army can 
march steadily in the face of dangers with a courage impos- 
sible to the same men acting individually. Likewise, if a 
panic seize the army, fear passes from one to another with an 
intensity which it could never have in them as individuals. 
Crowds are easily swayed by emotion and roused to unrea- 
soning action. The stock market is quickly thrown into an 
unreasoning panic. Political opinions sweep unaccountably 
over the country like tidal waves. A public man may be a 
popular hero one day and the object of universal antipathy 
a few days later. The man remains the same; some trifling 
event perhaps marks the change of opinion, but cannot be 
said to be the cause. There is no explanation except the 
change in the tide of popular thought. It is easy to think 
what everybody is thinking, to say what everybody is say- 
ing, to do what everybody is doing, to fall in with the 
crowd and be swept along with the current. A few men 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY 293 
are strong enough to stand against the mob, and even at 
times to turn it. At any rate the study of the group mind, of 
mob psychology, of mind in the mass, is a most inviting and 
profitable field. 
Child psychology. It has been said that the greatest dis- 
covery of the past half century, if not of all time, has been 
“the discovery of the child.” At least up to a century and a 
half ago all educational procedure was upon the assumption 
that a child was simply a small adult, of less size and strength 
and importance, but essentially the same in physical, mental, 
moral, and spiritual nature and subject to the same sort of 
influences, impulses, and laws of growth. This opinion has 
been radically changed. The study of children has disclosed 
the tremendously important fact that they have their own 
distinct and quite definite psychology. Their impulses are 
very different from those of adults, and change from period 
to period as the child passes through the years from infancy 
to maturity. The characteristic impulses of the child are 
no more different from those of an adult than are his types of 
imagery, attention, sense percepts, concepts, reasoning, inter- 
ests, and the summation of these in his mental and spiritual 
personality, character, and will. With the establishment of 
child psychology, education has become a science as other- 
wise it could never have been. Every young person is a 
prospective parent, and many who read this book are pro- 
spective teachers. To all who will have the responsibility for 
the care and instruction of children, child psychology is a sub- 
ject of transcendent importance. The wise care and training 
of children is the chief responsibility of each generation. To 
those upon whom this responsibility rests nothing is of more 
importance. 
Other fields. Other divisions of psychology are develop- 
ing and taking their place as separate lines of study. More 
detailed and extended study into special departments has
-P-A-G-E-290
  274 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
given us psychologies of habit, of sensation, of reasoning, of 
attention, of memory, of the emotions, etc. Similar subdi- 
visions are being developed in the fields discussed in the 
preceding paragraphs. Other divisions of the subject arise 
from the methods of investigation employed, as experimen- 
tal, introspective, etc.; or from the central point of view in 
the discussion, as functional, behaviorist, descriptive, ana- 
lytic, etc. Other distinctions have reference to the field of 
application. Of these we may notice a little more fully the 
following. 
Educational psychology. No work is so completely de- 
pendent for its success upon the principles of psychology 
as the infinitely important work of education. Every prin- 
ciple of teaching is a principle of applied psychology. This 
book has sought to apply throughout the principles of 
psychology, as they have been presented, to the art of learn- 
ing, to education as directed by the learner himself rather 
than by a teacher. Besides its value to the learner in solving 
his own problems, and especially because of this value, this 
kind of study is believed to be the most effective approach to 
the problems of educational psychology. But it is only an 
approach. Efficient teaching is as exact a science as is the 
science of medicine, and is as dependent on a knowledge of 
mind processes as the practice of medicine is dependent on 
a knowledge of the body and its processes. 
Psychology of religion. It is being more clearly recognized 
that whatever may be the ultimate facts of religious thought 
and worship, the practical religion of human beings and the 
only part of religion that is subject to our control and devel- 
opment is the religious concepts, reasoning, instincts, ideals, 
impulses, habits, and such like psychological facts. Much 
study is now being given to this aspect of religious phe- 
nomena, much valuable research has already been accom- 
plished, much valuable literature published, and it is very
-P-A-G-E-291
  
THE FIELDS OF PSYCHOLOGY 275 
evident that religious teaching and training must more and 
more be based on psychological foundations. 
Psychology of advertising, salesmanship, etc. It is no less 
evident that the effectiveness of advertising is subject to the 
principles of perception, apperception, association of ideas, 
habit formation, reasoning, attention, interests, impulses to 
action, and other purely psychological phenomena. The 
effect of a newspaper advertisement or a billboard may, with 
the aid of sufficient psychological data, be foretold with al- 
most the same accuracy as that of a chemical combination. 
The same is largely true of salesmanship, and this art is 
gradually becoming a science based on the principles of 
psychology. Industrial efficiency in the organization of 
shops, office forces, employment policies, wage scales, and 
every other relation that has to do with human character and 
impulses is now being recast along the lines laid down by 
psychological study. ‘ 
Other applications. The physician dealing with human 
ailments, the lawyer seeking to impress judge and jury, 
detectives tracing crime through motives and probabilities 
of conduct, judges seeking to weigh the worth of testimony 
and the effect of punishment, and those who have the over- 
sight and control of prisoners,—all are dealing primarily 
with the factors of human psychology. No business or pro- 
fession which deals with human materials can be more than 
guesswork except as it is based on psychological foundations. 
In most of these fields only the surface has been scratched 
by scientific psychology, but already the contributions have 
been large, and all are turning more and more to the psychol- 
ogists for guiding principles. .

CHAPTER XX 
THE POWERS OF A TRAINED MIND 
The problem of formal discipline. During the past quarter 
century there has been extensive discussion among educa- 
tional psychologists, sometimes with considerable heat of 
controversy, -on the problem of what is known as “formal 
discipline” or the “transfer of training.” The question at 
issue was how skill or ability acquired by a learner in one 
field of study is made available for application in other and 
different fields. For example, mathematics has been taught 
in the high schools primarily in the belief that it develops 
“the reasoning faculty”; history has been studied “to im- 
prove the memory” or “to develop the imagination”; and 
other subjects have been defended on the ground that they 
give the learner accuracy, thoroughness, and similar qualities. 
In reply to the commendable inquiries of the earnest student 
as to why he is required to study certain subjects of the cur- 
riculum he has been told in general that they train the mind. 
It would hardly be fair to him to close this book on mind 
training without giving a more definite indication of how he 
is expected to accomplish this training through the medium 
of his school and college studies. 
The discredited faculty psychology. In times past it was 
thought that one’s mind was made up of a number of distinct 
“faculties” which were called the memory, the reason, the 
imagination, the attention, the perception, the will, and such. 
Each of these was regarded as a separate part capable of dis- 
tinct development. Phrenologists claimed to have located 
; 277
-P-A-G-E-294
  278 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
these so-called faculties, and such traits as reverence and 
combativeness, in the brain and to be able to determine their 
respective development by the bumps on one’s skull. Educa- 
tional discussions indicated that psychologists thought of 
these faculties almost as if they were distinct organs which 
could be developed by special exercise like so many muscles. 
Just this comparison was often made. Studying geometry 
was said to develop one’s reason precisely as chopping wood 
develops the muscles of his arms. Learning history was said 
to strengthen the memoty exactly as walking strengthens the 
leg muscles. Mathematics was supposed to develop accuracy 
as singing develops the voice. It was asserted that any sort 
ofwork develops the willif only it is hard enough. And each faculty or ability so developed was assumed to be imme- 
diately available for use in any work to which it could be 
pplied, just as strength acquired in lifting weights could be 
(oliea to digging ditches or pitching hay. With the rise of 
a more scientific psychology and an understanding of the 
neural processes involved, such theories became entirely un- 
tenable. “The dogma of formal discipline,” as the old idea 
was called, became the object of merciless attack. No longer 
could educators justify the requirement of subjects of study 
solely on the ground of their “disciplinary values,” by which 
was meant the separate development of these supposed facul- 
ties. If there are no such faculties, it was argued, there can 
be no such values in studying these subjects. Many went so 
far as to say that no subject should be taught in the schools 
which could not be defended on the ground of the practical 
value of the knowledge it afforded. 
The problem restated. But tradition often serves to bal- 
ance the extreme tendencies of changing theory; and before 
the curriculum was radically revised educators recognized 
~ that, whatever the explanation, the study of mathematics, the 
classics, logic, and some other subjects does quite commonly 
 
-P-A-G-E-295
  THE POWERS OF A TRAINED MIND 279 
leave disciplinary values which count tremendously for suc- 
cess in life even long after the subject matter in which they 
were attained has been forgotten. True, some sought to ex- 
plain the evident connection between the pursuit of these 
“hard” subjects and the superior abilities manifested by say- 
ing that only pupils of superior ability succeeded in the hard 
subjects, that the studies selected the students of unusual 
capacity rather than developed them. Furthermore, observa- 
tion and more or less scientific investigation show conclu- 
sively that many who study the “disciplinary subjects” do not 
acquire those qualities of accuracy, good judgment, reasoning 
power, good memory, and the like which they are assumed to 
develop. On the other hand, the accumulated evidence is too 
convincing to be lightly dismissed that just such superior 
abilities are acquired by a considerable proportion of students 
concurrently with, and apparently as a result of, the study of 
subjects which are characterized by much hard work and rela- 
tively little information of a practically useful sort. Hence 
much thought and investigation have been devoted to the 
problem which may be stated thus: If the formal discipline 
theory is untenable, exactly what effects of a permanently 
valuable: sort can be retained from studies, aside from the 
practical knowledge acquired, and just how are these values 
assured and made available in other activities of life? 
The transfer of training. Out of the many theories and 
explanations there have been sifted these conclusions which 
are of immense importance to the student who is ambitious 
to make the most of his capacities.. First: Some of the so- 
called general abilities are merely the sum total of a great 
many specific abilities. These are not acquired in mass or by 
some general trick of learning, but by patiently accumulating 
the specific abilities one by one. For example, ability in mul- 
tiplication is not a single thing but is automatic accuracy in 
each of forty-five or more distinct combinations. A good
-P-A-G-E-296
  280 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
vocabulary in a native or foreign language is the sum of a 
large number of different words separately learned. Spelling 
ability is several thousand distinct items of spelling knowl- 
edge. Scientific knowledge is knowledge of many scientific 
facts. Such cumulative knowledge is so widely useful and 
enters into the solution of so. many varied problems that it 
appears to be some distinct unitary power. Second: Many 
bits of knowledge and of skill acquired in the complex proc- 
esses of study are required in the efficient performance of 
other very different complex processes of life work. ‘These 
elements are simply carried over in practically their original 
form and applied in such very different connections as to 
lose their identity except under most careful analysis. This 
is known as the transfer of training by identical elements. 
Third: _ Methods or habits of work acquired in one field of 
activity may be transferred to other specific fields or they 
may be generalized and become the characteristics of one’s 
work in many or all kinds of activity. (While each of these 
three views has been offered as a general explanation of all 
transfer of training, it now seems that there is no conflict 
among them; that all are true and that they supplement each 
other perfectly.\ All seem equally sound from our knowledge 
of neural conditions and the principles of association of ideas. 
All are equally necessary to explain the facts. The first 
emphasizes the necessity of patient-aceumulation of much 
material from many sources. . \The_ second stresses the im- 
the-value of selecting those details-of fact att reaing dvhich, 
have the widest usefulness. Neither of thesé-two is really 
discipline or transfer in tl the same sense as is the third, which 
is more complex and will be discussed separately) 
Transfer by ideals of method. In our chapter on memory 
we found that what is known as a “good memory” is really a 
good method of memorizing. We showed there how one may
-P-A-G-E-297
  THE POWERS OF A TRAINED MIND 281 
deliberately attain any desired degree of ability to remember 
the names, faces, and other facts regarding people—if he is 
willing to pay the price in persistent effort—by adopting a 
method of securing vivid impressions and frequent recall and 
by making that method habitual. A method habit so ac- 
quired may with slight modifications be applied with equal 
success to learning the names and characteristics of plants, 
animals, facts of history, numbers, vocabularies, or any other 
things which one may wish to remember. \But merely because 
one has acquired such methods in connection with persons it 
does not follow that he will use it in the other connections. It 
might possibly be transferred in some degree by chance, but 
to become a certainty it must be purposely and positively 
transferred by deliberate effort. (1) The method itself must 
be studied and beconfe~an ideal of procedure; (2) this ideal 
must be consciously adapted to the new field of application; 
and (3) the application in this new field must in turn be made 
ahabit. Eventhen it will presumably function only in the two 
specific fields, the one from which it was abstracted and the 
one to which it has been definitely applied. But now\it will 
be possible and very much easier to apply it to a third appro- 
priate sort of things, and then still easier to apply it to a 
fourth, and so on until the application of this ideal of method 
in every field becomes itself a habit. This method of com- 
mitting to memory has then become truly generalized—is a 
characteristic of the individual himself as well as of his learn- 
ing in any particular connection. He then has indeed a good 
memory in the fullest sense of the term. Probably no one 
will ever perfect his ability to memorize in connection with 
all sorts of things. It is not desirable that he should. But 
so far as his training in one connection transfers and is made 
available in others, it is by means of this more or less effortful 
transfer and habituation of an ideal of method. What has 
been illustrated here by the method of memorizing is equally
-P-A-G-E-298
  
  282 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
true of methods of problem solving, of reasoning, of control- 
ling attention, of imagination, of perception, of any habits of 
work (or of neglecting work), or of such qualitiés as accu- 
racy, precision, promptness, or thoroughness. 
Transfer of methods of work. Some methods of thought 
and work are necessarily quite complex and difficult to isolate 
from their connections. Others are very definite and simple. 
To illustrate the latter, let us suppose that one finds that he 
has a habit of procrastination. Little matters are postponed 
from hour to hour and from day to day, awaiting “a more 
convenient season.” The result is that many things are never 
done, and others accumulate until they must be disposed of 
hurriedly at a more-inconvenient season. Now, one learns 
’ through some disciplinary training of tle schools, or perhaps 
from the harder school of practical experience, that the habit 
of keeping little things cleaned up promptly as he goes along 
avoids confusion and tremendously increases efficiency.! He 
adopts that invaluable slogan “Do it now” as applicable to 
his correspondence and gets delightfully satisfactory results. 
He readily sees how it applies equally to keeping his desk, 
table, room, or class notes in shape, and with some effort of 
persistence forms the habit of promptness and regularity in 
these matters. The ideal is very simple, though extending the 
habit may at times require a deal of determination. He soon 
finds that he is developing a notably increased power of dis- 
patch and executive ability. In like manner he finds that 
uncertainty and inexactness are hampering his efficiency in 
the study of Latin. He adopts the watchword “Be exact” with 
gratifying results. The fact that the ideal is so clearly and 
so simply expressed makes it easy to transfer to his study of 
mathematics and other subjects, to the keeping of his records, 
to his observations and drawings in science, and later to all 
his professional and business observations and transactions. 
“Be prompt,” “Never give it up,” “What is worth doing at
-P-A-G-E-299
  THE POWERS OF A TRAINED MIND 283 
all is worth doing well,” “A stitch in times saves nine,” are 
other slogans which sum up ideals discovered in some partic- 
ular line of activity, which are readily applied elsewhere and 
may in time become quite general traits of one’s work and 
character. - 
Transfer of methods of thought. (Methods of logical analy- 
sis and of problem solving are more subtle and complex. It 
is more difficult to determine precisely wherein lies the par- 
ticular key to efficiency. / But the necessity is therefore even 
greater for getting the ideal of method clear and then for 
positively transferring it by deliberate effort and patience to 
any lines of activity in which it is to be used. For example, 
one learns in mathematical studies the necessity of first stat- 
ing his problem clearly, of formulating definitely just what 
it is he is trying to find out or to prove; next, of listing the 
pertinent facts or data with which he must work; then, of 
selecting from his previous knowledge the principle or rule 
by which such data may be combined to bear upon the prob- 
lem; then, of performing the combinations indicated and 
finding the desired result ; and finally, of testing or proving 
the result. He will find that the problems of the physician, 
engineer, lawyer, teacher, merchant, banker, farmer, and 
housewife are subject to practically the same kind of analysis’ 
and ‘solution. \Whether his study of mathematics will in any 
degree increase his efficiency in solving these problems of 
life depends on whether he actually does form efficient 
method habits of solving his problems in mathematics, 
whether he becomes definitely conscious of just what these 
efficient habits consist in, whether these methods become his 
ideal of procedure in the more practical problems of life, 
and whether this ideal is adequately adapted to the new 
situations and applied until it becomes habitual therein. 
Ideals of method as the aim of this book. It will be re- 
called that our first chapter set up as the primary aim of our
-P-A-G-E-300
    284 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
study the attainment of more effective methods and habits 
of learning. From chapter to chapter we have followed our 
analysis of the several processes of mental life with discus- 
sion of the ideals and methods of controlling them effectively. 
We have frequently illustrated the ideals from the problems 
of the work of the student. The exercises at the end of each 
chapter were formulated to bring into clearer relief in the 
student’s mind the precise nature of these methods of control 
and to afford some practice in using them. If the instruc- 
tions and suggestions given have been faithfully followed, the 
student will have already attained no small amount of the 
mind-training discussed in this chapter. If he has applied 
to this text and to all his work so far as they are applicable 
the principles of economical learning outlined in the first 
chapter, he will appreciate the purpose of this chapter and 
will have attained that purpose in large measure. 
The price of mental power. In any case the reader must 
realize that books and teachers can but suggest and guide; 
that the attainment of superior ability in the solution of the 
problems of life depends on the faithfulness of the individual 
in attaining through conscientious painstaking the best 
methods of work in all his study, in deliberately applying 
these best methods in whatever other work he may under- 
take, and in utilizing all the principles of habit formation to 
the end of making these supremely important methods his 
most natural and automatic form of procedure. Regardless 
of differences in inherited endowment, each individual is con- 
cerned with the problem of making the most of himself, of all 
his mental powers, and the price of this attainment is per- 
sistent determination in the strenuous task of continuously 
increasing his equipment of knowledge, high ideals, and habits 
of doing all things worth while in the best possible way.

DIAGRAMMATIC REVIEW 
The following diagrams illustrate in terms of supposed 
nerve connections the progressively higher organization of 
sensory-motor arcs (see page 22) involved in several types 
of activity discussed in the text. It must 
ysG be remembered that these are in no sense 
RY pictures and that much of the detail 
4 7) assumed is theoretically inferred from 
i the limited knowledge as yet available 
eee concerning the actual nature of neural 
connections. The diagrams are not at- 
tempting to present any facts regarding 
nerve connections, but to make clearer the nature of the 
psychological processes. 
Fig. 12 represents a simple reflex, 
beginning with the stimulation of a 
sensory nerve, S, and immediately 
reflected through a lower ganglionic 
center, G, and motor nerve to a re- 
sponding muscle, M. The faint lines 
indicate other neurones accessible 
but not organized into this path. No 
consciousness is involved. 
Fig. 13 involves a more complex 
response, The simple reaction M serves as a sensory stim- 
ulus to,arouse supplementary and codperating responses, 
M,, M.,M;. Sensory currents to the cortex from all parts

involved give rise to consciousness of the entire process. The 
reaction is still reflex in that it is not directed by consciousness. 
Fig. 14 shows the relation of instinct to learning. The solid 
line J represents an inherited unit of synaptic organization 
of neurones, whether effective at birth or automatically 
maturing later. The faint lines indicate billions of other 
  Fic. 14 
neurones more or less organized into similar paths. A simple 
reflex instinct, such as lower animals show, would be repre- 
sented by Fig. 12, but the characteristic human instinct is 
ineffective until organized through experience with appro- 
priate sensory stimuli and motor responses, indicated by 
dotted lines. Thus a typical instinctive act is partly inher- 
ited, partly learned, and the learned part may be variously 
associated with different stimuli and responses. 
Fig. 15 represents the steps in the formation of a habit. 
The stimuli involve a physical situation, S, and, if a con- 
scious purpose is involved, a centrally initiated idea of the
-P-A-G-E-304
288 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
desired activity, P. The first response consists of any com- 
bination of more or less random and poorly coérdinated 
movements, M,—M,,. Successive repetitions progressively 
eliminate the least ef- 
fective of these and 
strengthen the more 
promising (marked by 
heavier M-lines) until 
the response has been 
narrowed to the sat- 
isfying combination 
M,, Mi. Economy 
in habit formation de- 
pends on the definite- 
ness and force of P, 
Fic. 15 the conscious obser- 
vation of each of the 
responses, and corrective control by comparison with P. 
When S-M,-M,, is fully established it functions as a reflex, 
and consciousness is eliminated. 
Fig. 16 represents the integrating activity involved in per- 
ception. The physical object serves as stimulus to initiate 
    various sensory currents which, in the respective cortical 
sensory centers, give rise to corresponding sensations. These 
sensations, however, occur only in combinations as the men- 
tal object, due to the unifying of the sensory currents in 
 
-P-A-G-E-305
  DIAGRAMMATIC REVIEW 289 
some associative center, O. This mental object, in turn, is 
known only as interpreted by previous experience or apper- 
ceived by means of a previously organized concept, C,. 
Illusions are false perceptions due to association of O with 
a wrong C; hallucinations are due to the production of O by 
some other cause than sensory currents from the object ; am- 
biguous perception results when O is apperceived alternately 
to two distinct C’s. (Accompanying motor responses and 
other associations not directly pertinent are omitted from the 
diagram on page 288.) The apperceptive element in this proc- 
ess is identical with perceptual judgment of an informal sort. 
Fig. 17 shows certain characteristics of conceptual judg- 
ment, J, which is the uniting (by synaptic paths) of concepts. 
Any series of such judgments is thinking, and reasoning is 
thinking guided by a conscious purpose. (Since reasoning 
proper is a purely 
central process,the 5 
motor accompani- pe 
ments are omitted.) 
The well-informed 
mind consists in 5 
an adequate equip- 
ment of C’s based S 
on experience and, 
more especially, in 
the abundant effec- Fic. 17 
tiveJ’s which make 
all C’s readily available in thinking. Thorough learning of 
one C consists not in the needlessly automatic single asso- 
ciation (as C,), but in the multiplicity of associations with 
other C’s (as C,). Any J is believed unless and until in- 
hibited by the establishing of a conflicting J; for example, 
if +J means that every C, is C,, and —J means that no C, 
is C,, then these two J’s cannot exist together. Memory is

the retention of synaptic paths, recall is the retracing of 
them, and recognition is their recall in connection with identi- 
fying associates together with certain feelings of vividness 
and familiarity due to the ease of retracing well-unified 
paths. Imagery is the retracing of paths originally made by 
sensory experiences, whether in new or old combination. It

largely overlaps both memory and reason, since the same 
paths may be involved in all three processes, but reason may 
also deal with abstractions which are secondary and non- 
sensory concepts and associations. 
Fig. 18 represents a number of concepts (organizations of 
related experiences—sensory or ideational) experienced or 
thought together in various combinations and degrees of 
vividness as indicated. S is any entering sensory or ideational 
current. To which ideas it will be apperceived is obvious. 
Some of these C’s have no point of contact, C,; some are vivid 
enough but have no suggestive associates for further explora-

tion, C,. These are not interesting. Others are familiar, with 
new points inviting attack, C,; others are new with old 
relations, Cs; such are interesting, that is, are favorable 
for attention or exploratory activity. Some have been or- 
ganized with motor connections and tend to expression, C,, 
etc.; others, C,, C,,, are organized to lead only to yet more 
abstract and intangible ideas. Some are well organized and 
knit together, C,,; others are too loose to function in a uni- 
tary way, C,;. C,. is isolated—a “cortical island”—and 
  will probably not function in thought, however clear in itself. 
Find in your own mental organization ideas to illustrate each 
of these types of concepts and combinations. Prescribe just 
what should be done in each case to improve the situation. 
Fig. 19 attempts to illustrate why U, a general or universal 
idea, derived by induction from a number of sensory ob- 
servations of individual facts, is necessarily more reliable and 
useful than U, derived from higher abstractions by defini- 
tion and deduction. There is also danger that deriving con- 
cepts from definition may result in merely retaining words 
with no valuable associations of any kind. 
Fig. 20 represents the reénforcing of a sensory-motor circuit, 
S1-M, in an emotional state. Through a (more or less in-
-P-A-G-E-308
292 PSYCHOLOGY AND SELF-DEVELOPMENT 
stinctive) connection at A the stimulus liberates reserve nerve 
energy from the reservoir, R (probably in the “sympathetic,” 
or “autonomic,” system). This not only strengthens the 
motor current itself but stimulates to special exertion the 
heart and other vital organs, V, which variously stimulate 
each other and coéperate to strengthen the response M. The 
  Fic. 20 
digestive organs, D, and some other normal processes are 
deprived of their actuating currents, which are diverted to 
further reénforce M. According to the Lange-James theory, 
instead of consciousness C being a directing factor, the whole 
process is automatic, and stimulus, response, and general dis- 
turbed state are reported to consciousness together. 
Will and character imply the complete and balanced inte- 
gration of the entire system of nerves, as of mental and 
physical processes; while the various abnormal states are 
characterized by corresponding divisions and dissociations.

INTRODUCTION 
HE making of surveys and the holding of conferences 
are not new things. When Joshua wanted to take 
the land of Canaan, you will remember, he sent out men to 
make a survey of conditions and give a report. When they 
returned, he held a conference with them to discuss the 
problems to be met. People who have seen with their own 
eyes, and who have had personal experience of problems, 
have something of value to contribute to a discussion of 
those problems. 
With this fact in mind, the workers in the field of health 
education were asked by the American Child Health As- 
sociation to name the problems to be discussed at the 1924 
Health Education Conference, and then to come and discuss 
them. The program reproduced on the next page, which 
was sent to the members in advance of the conference, 
represents the questions the workers themselves chose to 
consider. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology as- 
sisted in the planning and conduct of the conference and 
offered its buildings in Cambridge as the place of meeting. 
Thanks are due to the chairmen of the various meetings 
and round tables, and to the members of committees, all of 
whom gave freely of their time and effort. "The Committee 
on Summaries and Recommendations had the difficult task 
of ascertaining and crystallizing the general opinion of the 
conference, rather than of summarizing discussions, and of 
preparing, on the basis of those opinions, conclusions and 
recommendations for adoption by the conference. 
The program was intentionally left somewhat flexible in 
the hope that this would insure a free pooling of experi- 
ences. It naturally resulted that some discussions were 
rather scattered. When topics have been rearranged, and 
discussions summarized, in this report, it has been simply 
for the convenience of the reader. The aim, in the prepar- 
ation of the report, has been to make it as useful as 
possible rather than to follow the exact order in which the 
various speeches were presented.

V. By What Standards are Teachers to Judge the Effec- 
tiveness of their Health Teaching? 
1. Improved health? 
2. Better attitudes? 
It will be seen that these two programs were in progress simul- 
taneously. A general session, not noted on this program, was held 
each day, later than the section meetings, to summarize for the entire 
group the morning discussion in each group and to give opportunity 
to members attending either section to add their contributions to the 
subject discussed by the other section. In this way it was possible 
not only to get the concentrated attention of a group on a particular 
subject, but also to have the entire conference participate in the 
discussion of every topic on the entire program.

  PURPOSES OF THE CONFERENCE 
OPENING SESSION 
Professor C. E. Turner, Chairman 
The Chairman opened the conference by introducing 
Professor S. C. Prescott, head of the Department of Biology 
and Public Health, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
ADDRESS OF WELCOME 
Professor Prescott: 
HILE it is my own personal good fortune to have 
this opportunity to express the welcome of the Insti- 
tute to you, it is your misfortune, because Dr. Stratton, the 
President of the Institute, had hoped to be here, and to tell 
you himself how much we appreciate your coming to a tech- 
nical school for a conference of this sort. 
We should like to have you feel that during your stay 
here the Institute is yours. We want you to feel at home 
here, and to make the most of your opportunities to see us, 
and to see the place, as well as to see each other. We havea 
great deal of pride in this institution, not merely because it 
is a great technical school for the training of engineers, but 
also because it is the first technical school in this country 
that has placed any emphasis at all upon the subject of 
health education. You may be surprised that this is so; 
but if you stop to realize how intimately health education 
is concerned with the question of general leadership, you 
will see that we are simply trying to coordinate this particu- 
lar phase of education with the other phases of education 
in industry and technical work, so as to make it possible for 
the men who come to us to conserve their powers, and build 
up their bodies. Leadership after all is perhaps as much a 
matter of health as it is of personality or training. This

Institute has had a Department of Public Health here for 
more than thirty years. I think it may have been the first 
technical school in the world to have a Department of Pub- 
lic Health. We have been interested in the problems of 
health education for many years, keenly so in the last few 
years, since Professor Turner has been our guiding spirit in 
this kind of thing. Our department, of course, is only a 
small cog in a big machine. 
Professor Prescott told the conference some very interesting things 
about the Institute’s work and made suggestions as to places of 
interest, in the Institute and in Boston, which could be visited. 
Professor Prescott closed by extending to the conference in the 
name of the Institute, in the name of the Department of Biology 
and Public Health, and from his personal standpoint, a most cordial 
welcome. 
Chairman: 
Many of you have attended a previous conference of this 
sort at Lake Mohonk. Some of you attended the confer- 
ence at San Francisco last summer. All of you have seen 
the development of the present health education movement 
from almost its beginning, because we are in a very new - 
development in public health and in education. The lead- 
ership developed by the Child Health Organization and the 
American Child Health Association has been a dominant 
factor in enlarging the vision and giving direction to this 
movement in which we are all vitally interested. I am go- 
ing to ask Miss Sally Lucas Jean, Director of the Health 
Education Division of the American Child Health Associa- 
tion, who has done so much to develop this movement and 
this type of conference, to speak to us for a moment. 
Miss JEAN OUTLINES THE PURPOSES 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
Miss Jean: 
E have met today for the purpose of discussing 
chiefly problems of administering health programs 
in teacher training centers and in school systems. It is 
accepted by educators generally that the time has come for
-P-A-G-E-17
  Purposes of the Conference 9 
health teaching of a different nature than that of the formal 
book study of the past, and the obstacles involved are recog- 
nized to be largely administrative. 
The question facing us now is not, as it was five years 
ago when the first conference on health education was 
called, as to the place of the teacher in this field, but rather 
the question of how the teacher training centers can best 
arrange their courses to prepare teachers to teach health; 
and how the school system can best administer the work of 
their teachers so that they may teach health effectively. 
We all know that the first requisite is a good teacher, and 
it is as difficult to secure this rare product for the sub- 
ject of health as for that of music or arithmetic, and some- 
what more so, as habits of daily living must be formed if the 
work of the teacher is to be effective. Progress in educa- 
tion is making very rapid strides, we all know, though we 
become discouraged by the apparent lethargy of some of 
our school administrators; but in our most pessimistic mo- 
ments we know there are bright spots in America, and brave 
spirits are forging ahead toward education for life rather 
than for college entrance examinations. 
Health education can only progress as fast and as far as 
education progresses, which adds to the burden on our 
shoulders—those of us who are on fire to carry the health 
message—the responsibility of enlightening the public as to 
the importance of the modern movement in education. 
The teacher training centers and the school systems can 
only progress in proportion to public enlightenment. There 
is no way to accomplish this enlightenment but to recog- 
nize the need for higher educational standards. Scholar- 
ships for teachers which will enable them to study and to 
travel will do much, as each well-trained teacher becomes an 
influence in raising the standard of teaching and so presents 
a desirable example of good teaching to fathers and moth- 
ers who are voters and who decide what shall be spent upon 
the education of their children. When we have fully edu- 
cated teachers we will have fully educated children, and 
when we have completely educated children we will have 
attained our goal of healthy children. 
The opportunity of this conference is, as I see it, to set 
the standards for health education. The administrators of The need for 
high stand- 
ards 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
teacher training centers are ready to accept a high standard 
and the superintendents of schools are also eager for guid- 
ance. We want, however, in our recommendations to be 
sure that we take into consideration budget limitations, as 
public opinion has not advanced to the place where we can 
be sure that a desirable program will be endorsed and thus 
guaranteed support. 
To secure a well-trained teacher requires a large expendi- 
ture of public funds, and to secure for the teacher in service 
wider opportunities and additional training also necessi- 
tates more generous expenditure. Smaller classes which 
are essential for satisfactory teaching necessitates an in- 
creased teaching staff. Only a convinced and aroused pub- 
lic will make possible appropriations to cover the cost of 
these obviously desirable developments. 
While we work toward the highest standard for health 
teaching, we cannot, however, be willing to “stand with 
arms akimbo set” until the dawn of a better understanding 
on the part of all the people, which is essential to the great- 
est progress. We can at least see that the funds expended 
for medical inspection, nursing, nutrition programs, phys- 
ical education, and the teaching of hygiene are well spent. 
This can only be true if the child is considered the unit, the 
specialist combining with the teacher in developing a well- 
rounded program which will insure the healthiest human 
being the funds expended will permit. 
In the name of the American Child Health Association, 
it is my great privilege to welcome you here. This yearly 
conference has come to mean a getting together of the health 
education clans. The first meeting in New York at Russell 
Sage Hall, the second at Lake Mohonk, and the third at 
San Francisco were each significant. They each mark a 
step in advance, a rod or two nearer our goal of building 
healthy boys and girls for the world. 
This meeting is most significant in that those registered 
have designated the program. This in itself is a distinct 
step in advance, a rod or two nearer our goal of building 
pected. We have dreamed dreams of a better world for the 
children of the future. You have met to make these dreams 
come true,

THE CHAIRMAN’s ANALYSIS OF THE PURPOSES 
OF THE CONFERENCE 
Professor Turner: 
ISS JEAN has not only pointed out for us the im- 
portant task which is ahead of this conference, but 
has also indicated to some extent the unique nature of this 
working group. Weare to have what is known to the press 
as “a closed conference,” not because we are doing anything 
in secret or in a corner, as the Good Book says, but because 
we have called together a group of people every individual 
of whom has something to contribute in this field. There is 
none here who has any personal propaganda to put across. 
There is none here who, because he represents some politi- 
cal organization or private agency, has some particular 
idea or plan to advocate. We are a group of people 
with a common ideal, with some vision of the tremendous 
task ahead of us in developing this new movement; and 
each of us is entirely free to contribute our experience to the 
development of truth. 
There is more than one way of doing things in health 
education work—bad ways and good ways, and probably 
a best way. We cannot solve all the health education 
problems at this conference; but from such a group as this, 
drawn from all parts of the United States, representing 
experience in all the special fields which contribute to the 
school health program, we shall not be living up to our 
obligations if we do not go far toward developing a set of 
standards which will indicate the best knowledge of the 
present moment. 
To do that, we have ahead of us this week a program of 
hard work. The success of the program depends upon 
frank, honest discussion, to which every member can con- 
tribute, and upon working hard and sticking to the job 
and the subject in hand. It will be a help if each member 
of this conference will give thought to each subject before 
he comes to the meeting, consider how it coordinates 
with the subjects to be discussed at other sessions, and be 
prepared to contribute, out of his experience, to the subject 
in hand. In order to move forward and achieve definite re-  
-P-A-G-E-20
  
  12 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
sults, it is necessary for us to adopt a rather careful plan of 
procedure. Miss Emma Dolfinger, American Child Health 
Association, will outline to us the procedure of sessions. 
PLAN OF PROCEDURE FOR THE CONFERENCE 
Miss Dolfinger: 
It is a gratification to see people here whose work repre- 
sents so many interesting fields and who have so much to 
contribute to the subjects in hand. It is important to our 
work here that you be frank about contributing. The con- 
ference, as Professor Turner has told you, is closed for the 
reason that we wish to have a small enough group to permit 
free discussion. 
You will notice that when you were asked to register 
we urged you to sign up for one of the two main conferences. 
We hope you will come to the group discussion you choose 
as consistently as you can. We wish to turn over to the 
chairman of each section the names of those registered in 
his group, so that he may know and call upon members 
for contributions to the discussion. Only by constantly 
going to the same group can we make the most of the 
discussion and develop the ideas which are presented. 
Our arrangements have been held somewhat in abeyance, 
waiting upon your wishes. We feel that the problems of 
health education have reached that point in the country to- 
day when we must pool our experiences and find out what 
has been successful. This is an opportunity to take stock 
and get new leads. The only way we can do this is to leave 
the program flexible and let it shape itself. The conference 
is a test of the project method; it is in your hands to develop 
as you choose. 
Chairman: 
Surely none of us will again have courage to advocate the 
project method with children if we fall down on this prob- 
lem which we have definitely set before us. Here is a test 
of our ability to think clearly as a group, to check our differ- 
ences of opinion (as to individual or minor matters), and 
to coordinate our past experiences into a definite whole.

PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION BY THE ADMINISTRATION 
SECTION 
Miss Dolfinger, Chairman 
Chairman: 
E are to discuss problems of health education 
from the administrator's viewpoint. The personal 
health of the teacher as an administrative problem is what 
you and others in the field have asked us to discuss at this 
time. Can a superintendent or principal expect that a 
complete school health program will result in better health 
for teachers, as well as better health for pupils? What 
must the school health program include in order to result in 
better health for teachers? How can the teacher’s day and 
the teacher’s job be arranged so as to conserve her health? 
How can the teachers themselves be stimulated to practice 
a full health program? In short, just what can the admin- 
istrator do about the teacher’s health and is it worth his 
while?

ABSENCES OF TEACHERS DvuE To ILLNESS 
Dr. Alexander M. Carr, Medical Director, Board of Educa- 
tion, Trenton, New Jersey: 
The first thing I did, when I began school health work 
in Trenton, was to study the problem of personal illness 
among teachers. We found that teachers were losing time 
that cost $12,000 or more a year. (In one year, 1,100 
teachers had lost 3,100 days, amounting to about $15,000.) 
I believed money would appeal to our Board of Education 
as nothing else would, so I placed these figures before 
the board. Trenton is working on a large school build- 
ing program which will take fifteen years to complete; 
the schools do not want to consider anything that may cost 
more money. I had to show them that here was an oppor- 
tunity to save money. ‘This secured the backing of the 
superintendent and we have been working on a standard of 
physical perfection. 
We wish to require certain standards of teachers, just 
as we require standards for working papers, and we 
want teachers brought up to those standards in the normal 
schools. We give teachers an examination before we ac- 
cept them. Out of eighty-three I recently examined, only 
five failed to pass: one for tuberculosis, two for underweight 
(25 and 22 pounds respectively), the others for bad tonsils 
and bad teeth. I tell our teachers: ‘You cannot teach 
health unless you are healthy yourselves.” 
Chairman: 
Undoubtedly the health of the teacher has a money value 
to the school system and to the teacher herself. Dr. George 
E. Carrothers, Director of Physical Activities, Cleveland, 
Ohio, says that in the year he studied the causes of absences 
of Cleveland teachers, 19,000 school days were lost among 
4,000 teachers and the cost of such loss, including all as- 
pects, was something like $300,000. During the first six 
months of 1924, money was saved, and days of instruction 
saved, partly as a result of health examinations of teachers. 
I wish that Dr. Carrothers were here to outline the plan 
he proposes to put into operation next year. The main el- 
ement of that plan is this:
-P-A-G-E-23
  The Teacher's Health 15 
The school day will be so arranged that the teacher will 
not have to take any school work home to prepare after she 
leaves the school. A room will be provided for the teacher 
at the school where, during the time of the school period, 
she may be quiet and not disturbed by the janitor coming in 
to clean up. This room is provided in order that she may 
have two hours of peace in which to do her work, so that 
when she leaves the school at five o’clock, her work will be 
done. 
The plan carries with it the idea of making special pro- 
visions, not at all compulsory, with certain recreational 
groups which propose to give thé right of way to teachers 
between the hours of five and seven. 
The plan also includes a complete recess from school 
duties between the hours of twelve and one; that is, the 
teacher will have no responsibilities during that hour; 
neither playground activities, class room duties, looking 
after school lunch or keeping in of children. She is to put 
on her hat, go out, get her lunch and do whatever she pleases 
in that hour. You all know of teachers who feel that they 
must supervise the activities of the children, or keep them 
out of mischief, or correct papers, every spare minute of the 
day from the time they come in the morning until the time 
they go home at night. 
There is a feeling among a great many people that the 
time must soon come when the school day will be organized 
from the viewpoint of improving the teacher’s health. 
Mrs. Florence M. Hobson, Instructor in Hygiene, Fairmont Junior 
High School, Cleveland Ohio, said she believed that if the money 
saved last year in Cleveland could have been put back into rest-rooms 
for teachers, it would have had a good psychological effect upon the 
teachers themselves. . 
Miss Effie F. Knowlton, Director, Health Education, Binghamton 
Public Schools, Binghamton, New York: 
This year in Binghamton we have succeeded in having a rather 
thorough health examination of every employee in the department 
of health. This has aroused a number of teachers and given them 
an interest in their own health conditions. We have had an exam- 
ination of the teachers also. I feel that this is still rather an 
experiment but am hoping we shall be able to do more of this 
work next year. We have tried to introduce some recreational ac- 
tivities through our Teachers’ Association in order to promote the 
teachers’ health. Our recreational work for children has reacted fa- 
vorably upon the teachers’ own health. The examination of every A plan to

teacher was quite thorough and we hope to follow it up. Some 
teachers have already had corrective work done. 
The subject of the examination was broached to the teachers by 
the superintendent, who presented it as an opportunity, even as an 
obligation, but not compulsory; and every teacher responded. 
Chairman: 
From our discussion thus far it would appear that the 
conservation of the teachers’ health is not usually one of the 
factors taken into consideration by the school administrator 
in planning the school program. We are anxious to hear 
of more of such planning, and the details of the plans. I 
shall ask Dr. Katherine H. K. Wolfe, Director of School 
Health in Lincoln, Nebr., to tell us how teachers in the Lin- 
coln schools were stimulated to practice a full health pro- 
gram. 
STIMULATING TEACHERS TO PRACTISE A FULL 
HEALTH PRocRAM 
Dr. Wolfe introduced her paper by saying that the indus- 
trial world is caring for its employees better than school 
systems are doing, and it does this because it is profitable. 
She believes that a pedagogical head with health vision and 
a resistant backbone has it in his power to set up a school 
health organization which will cause 100% of the teachers 
to build up their own health and deliver genuine health 
goods to their pupils. Teachers are influenced, just as 
children are, by the powers higher up. ‘The child reflects 
his teacher in his living habits, the teacher her principal, 
the principal the superintendent, the superintendent, in 
greater or less degree, the sentiments of community leaders. 
The superintendent and the principal therefore can stimu- 
late the teacher. 
Dr. Wolfe continued: 
If it is necessary to stimulate the superintendent before 
the teacher in service can be reached, it can probably be 
done most effectively through community demand, as by the 
organization of a “Community Child Health Committee of 
One Hundred,” made up of active men and women leaders 
in the community and in the school system, especially those 
already interested in child health. Such a committee was
-P-A-G-E-25
  
The Teacher's Health Le 
organized in Lincoln about two years ago to bring the prob- 
lem of malnutrition in children to the attention of the com- 
munity. As a result, forty-six teachers, principals, and 
supervisors in Lincoln registered for Dr. Emerson’s course 
in nutrition work. 
This committee consisting of fifty members at first was 
later increased to one hundred. When a special child 
health problem arises, the committee members are called by 
telephone on twenty-four hours’ notice, to meet at a twelve 
o’clock luncheon at our Chamber of Commerce building. 
The response is enthusiastic. A committee of this sort 
exerts an influence that will open the eyes of any superin- 
tendent blind to the health needs of his teachers and pupils, 
and further gives him the support essential to success. 
The full health program which we desire that teachers 
' shall practice must of course include physical examinations 
for teachers and a program of remedial and constructive 
health work. Very definite evidence was found in a study 
of absences from illness of Lincoln teachers during the 
1922-23 school year. It was found that: 
76.7% or 344 out of 448 teachers had been absent one-half or 
more days during the school year. 37% of the teachers had been 
absent 3 or more days. The average time of absence per teacher, 
based on the total number of teachers in the system, was 2.6 days. 
Lincoln’s 344 teachers were absent on account of illness, during the 
school year 1922-23, a total of 1388 days. The cost of substitute 
teachers for this period (at the average rate of $4.50 per day) 
amounts to $6,246. 
A school district could reasonably demand that teachers 
absent three days or more during a school year should have 
a medical examination. It would be justified also in adopt- 
ing the policy of insurance companies, which employ expert 
medical examiners, doing work free of charge for teachers 
willing to accept the service. The school district could defi- 
nitely plan to attract the attention of all teachers to their 
health condition; provide the best medical service for 
teachers; ascertain what hidden physical defects and dis- 
eases exist among the teachers and give the school medical 
examiner opportunity to urge corrective work. This should 
result in a better quality of teaching from the regular 
teachers and diminish the cost of substitute teachers. Lincoln,

Suggestions 
for stimulat 
ing health 
practices 18 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Stimulating teachers in service to practice a constructive 
health program is at the very heart of health education. 
Personally I am convinced that the average teacher knows 
no more about “how to live properly” than the laity, and is 
just as desirous as other people are to gain reliable informa- 
tion on the subject. This has been proved many times in 
my own experience and I have noticed also that as soon as 
teachers understand, their attitude and practices change. 
I offer the following ten suggestions as helpful in stimu- 
lating teachers to practice a full health program: 
1. Organize a “Community Child Health Committee of One Hun- 
dred” to foster physical, mental and moral child health work. 
2. Have an administrator with health vision at the head of the 
school system. 
3. Request all teachers who have been absent three or more days 
on account of illness during the previous school year to present 
evidence that they have recently had a complete medical examination 
by a physician in good standing. 
4. Persuade the school board to employ a medical examiner (a 
woman physician for women teachers) whose services shall be avail- 
able, free of charge, to all teachers desiring an annual medical 
examination. 
5. Train every teacher to be a health teacher. 
6. Make daily outdoor exercise compulsory for both teachers and 
pupils. Group children according to three physical types—strong, 
“borderline,” weak. If there are teachers of these types also, put 
in charge of each group a teacher of the same physical type as the 
children, to exercise with the group. 
7. Provide for the use of all teachers lessons containing health 
information presented in an interesting manner and in simple lan- 
guage. 
8. Provide for the use of teachers a full supply of the best refer- 
ence books, charts, films, slides, apparatus, etc., on health subjects. 
9. Bring local and out of town lecturers on health subjects into the 
school district as frequently as possible. 
10. Provide a medical health leader for the school district, a 
real leader, alive and gloriously healthy, who is able by training 
and experience to be the enthusiastic directing force behind the 
thrones of the “Community Child Health Committee” and the 
superintendent of schools. 
Dr. Walter S. Cornell, Director Medical Inspection of 
Schools, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: 
The health of the worker in industry has been brought 
into prominence by the passage of workingmen’s compen-  
-P-A-G-E-27
  
The Teacher's Health 19 
sation acts, which have been passed primarily for the bene- 
fit of the workingman. ‘These acts have led to the employ- 
ment of physicians by employers, largely a defensive meas- 
ure for their own protection. The employer who is liable, 
if his employee is sick or injured, is going to be very careful 
to find out whether or not he wants that person for an em- 
ployee; so he employs physicians to examine applicants 
for work. 
We have in Philadelphia, as is the case in Trenton, a 
physical examination of every employee—teacher, doctor, 
nurse or clerk; but this is largely for the protection of the 
employer. We must also look at this question of physical 
examinations for teachers from the standpoint of their 
own health and well-being, as well as for the protection of 
the employer. Teachers should employ their own physi- 
cians for this and work it out in their teachers’ associa- 
tions. The teachers’ associations have already taken 
some thought for the teacher’s protection: in Philadelphia 
they have endowed beds for teachers who are sick. The 
last bed cost $35,000. 
The Chairman then asked Dr. William Burdick, Director 
of the Playground Athletic League, Baltimore, Maryland, 
whether he had faced the problem of trying to interest his 
teachers in personal health. 
Dr. Burdick: 
Baltimore attempts to see that tuberculosis cannot be 
passed to the children from the teacher. ‘The law says that 
they shall yearly be examined to prevent that from occur- 
ring. This is done to protect the children, not the teacher. 
Girls who will teach in normal schools are examined for 
their health and in five years hardly any of those outside 
of the city of Baltimore will remain unexamined. 
Chairman: 
Have you been able to create any particular opportunities 
for teachers in the way of recreation? 
Dr. Burdick: 
Only by summer schools. In Maryland, every teacher 
must renew her teaching certificate every three years and a Physical ex- 
aminations

large proportion of them are being taught recreation in the 
summer schools of Maryland. 
Miss Towne: 
The physical achievement tests for girls and women, re- 
cently prepared by the Woman’s Division of the National 
Amateur Athletic Association, have been so arranged that 
they serve not only as standards of measurement, but also 
as goals toward which girls may work. The idea was 
to make a plan that would stimulate all kinds of participa- 
tion in athletic events. My experience with teachers has 
led me to know that very few teachers have many recrea- 
tional hobbies. Very few like to go on walks or play ten- 
nis or golf. Making our teachers recreationally minded is 
one of the next steps in health development. We have not 
any standard as yet for these tests in the city of Boston. 
The Chairman asked Dr. Harold H. Mitchell, Director 
of School Hygiene in the City Health Department, Fall 
River, Massachusetts, who had just returned from a tour in 
connection with a survey of school systems, whether he had 
found any systems in which the administration definitely 
undertakes, in any way, to further the health of teachers. 
Dr. Mitchell said he had not made special observation in 
regard to this, but he recalled no such provision; whereas 
he had been very much impressed by the examination given 
to applicants for employment by the Western Electric Com- 
pany in Cicero, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. 
Professor Turner then asked if anyone present had had 
any experience with extension courses for teachers in serv- 
ice, with the intent to improve the personal health of the 
teacher. 
Dr. Edwin F. Patton Associate Director, Medical Service, 
American Child Health Association: 
We gave a course in health education to the teachers of 
Sacramento. While the teachers were learning how to do 
better health work among children, they were applying to 
themselves the lessons they expected to teach to the children. 
This course was found to be one of the most necessary steps  
-P-A-G-E-29
The Teacher's Health 21 
to take in initiating the school health program. The his- 
tory of health work shows that health has to be carried to 
the people; they will not come after it. Sometimes it even 
has to be forced upon them. 
In taking health to the people, you must first give them 
facts and facilities; after that you must remind them fre- 
quently in respect to the use of those facts and facilities. 
We are likely to imagine that the few simple rules of 
healthy living are common knowledge; this is not the case. 
It was surprising to hear the questions asked by intelligent 
teachers during the-course of the lectures. 
We started with twenty teachers. We had urged each 
principal in the city to send one representative from her 
school, who could carry the message of the course back and 
apply it in her school. Most of the teachers frankly came 
under compulsion, or came in order to get an extra two 
hours of college credit which was given for the course, as 
this credit counts on their salary increases from year to year. 
As the work progressed they became interested and passed 
along suggestions to other teachers. 
The course consisted of twenty lectures with demonstra- 
tions given by the director of the department and experts in 
various lines. The course has now been extended to thirty 
hours and fifty teachers have voluntarily enrolled for it. 
The school board is considering the question of making it 
compulsory for every teacher to take it either before her 
appointment or immediately thereafter. While the purpose 
of the course was to prepare teachers to carry out a school 
health program for their children, we believe that the course 
reacted favorably upon the teachers in the matter of their 
own personal health. 
Dr. George T. Palmer, Director of Research, American 
Child Health Association, said he thought it would be well 
worth while to find out the causes of absence among teach- 
ers. He expressed our need of data from different school 
systems, because it is by contrast that the significance of any 
particular item comes forth. He suggested that there 
should be some uniform method of gathering information, 
so that it would be reliable. Dr. Palmer continued: “We 
have figures from a great many places in regard to the ab- Extension 
courses in 
health edu- 
cation
-P-A-G-E-30
  Research 
needed 
  22 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
sences of pupils, but it is difficult to compare figures from 
different cities because no two cities report in the same way. 
One city uses a percentage basis, another does not. One 
school takes a name off the register when the pupil has been 
absent for five days, and somewhere else a child is contin- 
ued on the register indefinitely. We need comparable 
data.” 
Chairman: 
The National Education Association, I understand, has 
a Research Department. I have been told that this Re- 
search Department has no figures on the causes of absences 
among teachers. It seems to me that this is something they 
ought to have since it has a direct bearing on all phases of 
education. 
Dr. Palmer thought it would be worth while to propose a 
study of the causes of teachers’ absences to the Research 
Department of the National Education Association. 
The Chairman endorsed the suggestion, saying “Indus- 
tries have for some time known exactly what their lost time 
cost has been. We ought to have more figures at the pres- 
ent time than we have which would tell us the percentage 
of the total salary fund which is used up in paying for 
teachers’ lost time. It ought to be a significant figure in 
school health administration.” She continued: 
“T gather from the discussion that you for the most part 
are agreed that every teacher applying for a position should 
have an examination by the board of education which will 
enable her to understand her physical limitations; that pro- 
vision should be made whereby she can have these deficien- 
cies corrected; also that only healthy applicants should be 
given permanent positions, and that permanent teachers’ 
licenses should not be granted to those lacking in physical 
efficiency.” 
Miss Reba F. Harris, State Director Modern Health Cru- 
sade, Jacksonville, Florida: 
You may be interested in Florida’s cooperative program 
of school health education. In the State of Florida we 
have 250,000 school children who are scattered over an area
-P-A-G-E-31
  The Teacher's Health 23 
of approximately 54,000 square miles. We have 7,000 
teachers. Many of these teachers come from all parts of 
the United States just to spend the cold winter months in the 
warm Southland. We find that training the teacher in 
service is our greatest problem, for your best teachers are 
staying at home. We get would-be tourists who drift from 
place to place each year. 
Both of our State Universities have teacher training de- 
partments which offer courses in health education, but they 
furnish only a small percentage of our public school teach- 
ers. 
In making a survey of the State I found fourteen differ- 
ent state organizations doing some form of health education 
in the public schools, and few of them knew of the others’ 
plan of work. In this group there were both official and 
non-official agencies—State Board of Health, Florida Pub- 
lic Health Association, Red Cross, home demonstration 
workers, dental and medical societies, women’s clubs, 
the Department of Public Instruction and the State Uni- 
versities. A meeting was called of the directors or repre- 
sentatives of those organizations. The programs of all 
were explained and discussed, and a permanent organiza- 
tion, known as the Florida Health Education Council, was 
formed. A program of work was formulated to meet the 
most outstanding needs of the State in regard to school 
health. These were, first, a unified program of health edu- 
cation required in the public school curriculum; second, a 
system of training teachers of small towns and rural com- 
munities in teaching health habits; and third, more co- 
ordinated efforts on the part of all organizations for carry- 
ing out the health program. 
A committee was appointed to work out a course of study 
in health education. This was submitted to the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, accepted and included 
in the general curriculum of the elementary grades. 
To meet the needs of the teachers who do not attend the 
State Universities, and to stimulate those who have had 
some training, the Health Education Council will issue a 
bulletin, based on the new course of study, showing how the 
different organizations can aid the teacher in the promotion 
of the health program. This bulletin will be compiled by 
all of the organizations, printed by the State Board of Florida’s 
program
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Health and a copy mailed to every teacher in the State by 
the General Extension Division of the State University. 
The bulletin will also be sent to every nurse and nutrition 
worker and to all others who are doing any form of health 
work in the schools. 
To further assist in teacher training the Council has 
organized a Speakers’ Bureau. We expect to have every 
county superintendent of public instruction devote at least 
one of his county teachers’ meetings to the subject of health 
education. Speakers will be furnished for these meetings 
through the Speakers’ Bureau. 
In the summer normals of both State Universities a spe- 
pune cial course in health education methods is being offered 
school under the auspices of the Council. The Florida Public 
eourecs Health Association is paying the salaries of the two in- 
structors, and the Universities are giving living expenses. 
Other plans for training the teacher are being worked out 
by the Health Education Council. 
At this point the meeting was adjourned to be continued 
at a joint session with the group discussing the conservation 
of the health of student teachers. 
Jotmnt Session, Monpay, JuNE 23, TO COMPLETE 
THE DIscUSSION OF THE PERSONAL HEALTH 
OF THE TEACHER 
Professor Turner, Chairman, asked Miss Dolfinger for 
a summary of the discussion in the Administration Section. 
Miss Dolfinger emphasized the fact that, so far as ex- 
perience in school systems represented by those present was 
concerned, little or no conscious effort was being made by 
principals or superintendents to administer the school 
program so as to conserve the health of the teacher. 
The question as to how teachers in service can be stimu- 
lated to practice a full health program yielded only sporadic 
experiences. It appears that teachers frequently have an 
opportunity to have health examinations, but even where 
this is the case, there is little provision for a follow-up pro-
-P-A-G-E-33
The Teacher's Health 25 
gram of remedial and constructive work. Extension 
courses in health education, designed to assist the teacher 
in teaching health to children, have indirectly benefited the 
health of the teacher, since she has often begun to practice 
the health habits recommended for the children. 
Miss Mabel C. Bragg, Assistant Superintendent of 
Schools, Newton, Mass., said that the pupils in Newton are 
greatly interested in the health of their teachers. They 
insist that those who are underweight shall drink extra milk 
and gain weight; and that those who are markedly over- 
weight shall take measures to reduce their weight. They 
are expecting to see results when school opens in the fall. 
She said also that the day’s discussion had given her an idea 
about something she could do, which was to make a study of 
absences of teachers last year, with the causes, and use this 
as a basis for a health talk to them in the fall. 
Dr. Oscar M. Craven, Director of Public Health, Spring- 
field, Ohio, discussing health examinations for teachers, 
said: 
I think we should make it plain that we mean an exami- 
nation by a competent physician. In my experience we 
have found it best to have physicians especially appointed 
by the board of education, so that there should be no bias 
whatever, and no chance for criticism thereafter. 
Chairman: 
Dr. Craven suggests that we might go on record as favor- 
. Ing an examination by a specially appointed physician. 
Miss Jean: 
It is most desirable that a competent and accredited 
physician should be appointed to make these examinations. 
We all feel the necessity of being sure that the examinations 
are well made in order to make them worth while. We 
want also to eliminate the possibility of favoritism and 
politics entering into the situation. 
Dr. Carr: 
It is most important to have an impartial physician, and 
to have impartial judgment. Health ex-

  | 26 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Chairman: 
Dr. Craven, what is your reaction toward these sugges- 
tions? 
Dr. Craven expressed his belief that boards of education 
can be depended upon to select physicians who will be both 
qualified and unbiased. 
The Chairman’s summary of the discussion in the words 
“Every teacher applying for a position should have an 
examination by a competent and impartial physician ac- 
credited by the board of education” met with the approval 
of the group. 
Dr. Carr then said: ‘I would like to tell you the interest- 
ing thing I found out this year in connection with last year’s 
absences. This year the teachers had ten days’ leave and 
there was a great increase in absenteeism. Last year there 
were fewer absences because they had to pay a substitute 
when they were absent.” 
Dr. James F. Crotty, Senior Instructor, Boston Continua- 
tion School, Boston, Mass.: 
I think the system in Boston and around Boston is very 
good. By giving one week off in ten, a lot of sickness is 
eliminated. The fractional loss of pay per day also helps 
to keep down the absences. 
Chairman: 
Do we understand that the teacher has a vacation? 
Dr. Crotty: 
It is a vacation for both teachers and children. 
Dr. Wolfe: 
That is good. I do not think teachers ought to come to 
school when they are sick. 
Miss Knowlton: 
We must guard against the teacher’s doing her work in 
school when she is not well. We should be careful about
-P-A-G-E-35
The Teacher's Health ' 27 
placing too great a premium on the teacher who has an un- 
limited amount of physical energy, but who does not put the 
thought in her work that the less strong teachers do. 
Dr. A. L. Brannock, Director of Health Education, Pontiac 
Public Schools, Pontiac, Michigan: 
I have tried to impress on the board of education that 
the thing to do was to allow the teacher to go away for 
awhile and rest; to raise her salary and insist that she take 
six weeks to two months vacation in the summer. She 
will do better work and be able to bear with the children 
better. 
Miss Jean: 
I feel strongly about this matter from the standpoint of 
increasing the teacher’s efficiency. We are trying in our 
schools to insist upon children with colds staying at home. 
If the teacher has a cold and stays at home, she loses her 
pay, yet for her own good, and for the children’s good, she 
ought to stay at home. When those teachers in Trenton 
stayed at home, they probably needed to do so. I believe 
women are inclined to give too much time to their work,

Miss Julia Wade Abbot: 
As you probably know, there is a movement on foot to 
give the teachers in the public schools a sabbatical year. 
Why not enable a teacher who has had a good health record 
to earn a sabbatical year? 
Dr. Carr: 
Is not that putting a high premium on the teacher’s 
health? 
Chairman: 
The Chair understands the point in question to be 
whether a teacher’s health record should not be an item to 
be considered in determining her advancement and sabbat- 
ical leave. 
A suggestion was made that teachers’ retirement funds 
would eliminate the fear of dependence and allow teachers 
to take the all-important year off for physical and profes- Retirement

  B. The Pre-School Child 
DIscussION AT A JOINT SESSION 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
HE school administrator realizes that the educational 
system cannot function successfully without healthy 
children; and in order to have healthy school children, the 
foundations for health, both physical and mental, must have 
been laid in the pre-school period. This is the only excuse 
the school administrator has for concerning himself with the 
pre-school program and this is also the reason for the in- 
clusion of this subject in the Cambridge Conference. 
From the viewpoint of his later responsibility, the pre- 
school program concerns the school administrator very 
greatly indeed. 
The discussion was opened by Dr. Douglas A. Thom, 
Director of the Health Habit Clinic of the Psychopathic 
Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRE-SCHOOL PERIOD 
Dr. Thom: 
The value of the pre-school health program can best be 
brought out, I think, by taking two aspects of the problem: 
First, what are the problems of the pre-school group of chil- 
dren? Second, what aspects of the pre-school child’s men- 
tal life are there that facilitate treating these problems? 
If habits can be developed at all along the line of pre- 
conceived ideas, they certainly can best be so developed 
during the pre-school period. In the first place, the pre- 
school period is the first period, the period when undesir- 
able habits and personality defects, many of the diseases 
(such as rickets and inherited syphilis), and many of 
the physical defects make themselves manifest. In this 
pre-school period we have opportunity to view for the first 
time the physical and mental deviations from the normal.

pre-school 
age is im- 
portant 
 
-P-A-G-E-38

| It is more important to treat and cure a disease either men- 
tal or physical at three than at seven, and more important 
to correct a deviation from the normal at three than at 
seven, because at seven we have delayed a number of years 
during which period this child has been handicapped. 
Most children present at the age of eight some of the 
same characteristics, such as plasticity, suggestibility and 
imitation. These characteristics are more marked during 
the pre-school period than at any other time and they are the 
very characteristics to be emphasized in the formation of 
desirable habits, in the overcoming of undesirable habits, 
and in the changing in any way of the child’s personal 
deviations. This makes the pre-school period a very im- 
portant one. i 
We must remember, however, that there is a possibility 
that children’s habits are not formed, and cannot be formed, 
according to our preconceived ideas, at least not to the ex- 
tent we have supposed. We have to consider the quality 
and the quantity of the mental aspects which children pre- 
sent. We must know just how suggestible the child’s mind 
is; just how imitative the child is; precisely what punish- 
ment means to him; what types of punishment appeal to 
the child, and what kinds he resents; and what the hopes 
and desires are of these children—all these things we must 
know before we attempt to form the child’s habits along 
Know the preconceived lines. Not learning these things first is a 
child mistake that is often made in the attempt to formulate 
habits. We do not take into consideration the quality 
and quantity of the material with which we have to work. 
With the child’s extremely rapid development of mental 
and physical characteristics, it is tremendously important to 
do all that can be done during the pre-school period. I 
mean. by this that a minor deviation from normal at the age 
of two may be exaggerated at the age of six; but if the same 
kind of deviation occurs at sixteen, it may be only a little ex- 
aggerated at twenty. The deviations in health, both physi- 
cal and mental, show up more readily, and are more dan- 
gerous to the future life of the child, when they occur at an 
earlier date. Illness and injuries and environment which 
would not be particularly important to the health—either 
mental or physical—of the child at twelve or fourteen, are 
important during the pre-school period.
-P-A-G-E-39
The Pre-school Child } 81 
From an anatomical, physiological and biological point 
of view, the child at six is pretty much a complete organism, 
so far as quality is concerned. It grows thereafter in 
height and stature, but in the kind of being it is, it is very 
much a finished product. 
Let us consider the importance of the pre-school age from 
the medical point of view. One of our large social prob- 
lems, from both the medical and educational viewpoint, 
is the mentally defective child. Practically 98% of all 
these children show defects before six years of age. We 
have here in Massachusetts a very progressive law. No 
other State I know of has the same requirements. An ex- 
amination is given and where ten or more children in a 
town show defective symptoms, a special class is held. 
Probably three-fourths of the deaf and dumb show their 
defects prior to the age of six years. ‘The program for those 
children should be started, not at fourteen or sixteen or ten or 
twelve years of age, but at an earlier date, when these chil- 
dren have plasticity and imitative ability, and can respond 
to suggestion; we should not wait, in formulating our pro- 
gram, until they become very much more handicapped, 
later on in life. 
Of all our speech defects, 80% of them occur, I believe, 
during the pre-school age; and the pre-school age is per- 
haps the only period when a very large percentage of those 
cases can be cured or corrected. From a psychological 
point of view, speech defects are the most discouraging 
we have to deal with in adult life. In children the treat- 
ment is very much more effective. 
In physically handicapped individuals we are again 
confronted with the same problem. From accurate statis- 
tics we find that one-third of all the physical handicaps 
of cripples occur before the sixth year of age. A pro- 
gram for these individuals should be made. We should 
not wait until later on in life when plasticity is lacking. 
We also have the neurotic child who is unstable and in- 
ferior. And we have the child who simply possesses un- 
desirable habits. Practically all of these cases make them- 
selves and their symptoms manifest during the first four 
years of life. From a long and intensive study of the con- 
vulsive diseases we find that one-half of all our chronic 
diseases have their origin prior to the fourth year of life; From a med-

very much more can be done for the child of three or four 
than can be done for him later on in life. 
What the relation is between insanity and these person- 
ality defects and deviations, and what insanity is, we do not 
yet know; but we do know from experience that there is a 
common characteristic and a common strain running 
through certain “chronic” individuals which makes them 
quite as incapacitated as individuals suffering from ill- 
nesses or individuals who are criminals. 
I go over to the Charlestown Prison in the morning and I 
examine a prisoner who is perhaps sentenced for life for 
murder. I find that the driving force, the thing which stim- 
ulated and prompted that murder, was jealousy. I go back 
to the clinic and I see some little tot of two or three who 
perhaps has made a vicious attack upon some member of the 
family. When the situation is studied, in the clinic and in 
the home, you find in the little child the very same motive 
that made this particular man shoot his neighbor,—jeal- 
ousy. When you get into the home you frequently find that 
the cause of this thing is very simple. Perhaps the father 
is not at home at night and the other children know they can 
arouse, in a very interesting and unusual way, this strong 
emotion of jealousy. The younger child, when forced to 
yield to the other children, instinctively reacts like the pris- 
oner. 
It is during the pre-school age that the inhibitions must 
be developed. The physical and mental health of the child 
can be treated at that period and at that period only. In 
the first place, the problems make themselves manifest at 
this time, and in many cases can only be treated successfully 
in the pre-school age of the child. 
I was thinking this morning of the pre-school child in 
relation to the new Ford I have just bought. Right after I 
got it the dealer took me aside and said if I handled it right 
I would have a fine car, and in order to handle it right it 
would be advisable for me to take ten lessons from him on 
howtorunacar. “Look after your gas and your battery,” 
he said. “Change your tires after going a certain number 
of miles.” “Why,” I asked, “are you so interested?” 
“We want to protect our car and we want to give service.” 
He told me I could learn to look after a car just as well as 
he could.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
The Pre-school Child 83 
I suppose there are very few doctors who take aside those 
of their patients that are parents, and say, “I would like to 
give you ten talks on how to look after your child during 
the first years of its life.’ Some mothers are practically 
helpless. This garage man was evidently more interested 
in his car than the average individual is in the pre-school 
child. We must give the children the same attention that 
the garage man tried to give the car he had sold to me. 
Here is an experience I had which was rather encourag- 
ing. An intelligent mother had been having trouble with 
her child in regard to his feeding. During the Christmas 
holidays Miss Eliot asked her to come’to the clinic and gave 
her a leaflet. In connection with our work we have many 
helpful leaflets containing information regarding children 
of the pre-school age. When the mother came in two 
weeks later I was gratified to hear her say that she 
did not need to come to the clinic: she had found exactly 
what she wanted in the leaflet, and had gotten results by ap- 
plying the information it contained. 
We have at the present time a limited amount of infor- 
mation which can be furnished to those who are interested 
in these subjects. We need more of it. This information 
should come from the educators, from the psychologists, 
and from those individuals who are making intimate con- 
tact with children. These groups ought to have contribu- 
tions to make. 
What organized agencies deal with the pre-school prob- 
lem? Nursery schools, clinics, research laboratories (as at 
Yale), habit clinics (such as we have here in Boston). All 
these are agencies where a certain amount of our knowledge 
in regard to the pre-school child can be put into operation. 
It seems to me that parents and all individuals who come 
into immediate contact with the child need a certain amount 
of instruction. 
District nurses, dietitians, settlement workers, medical 
and social workers, all see needs in respect to general medi- 
cal problems; so do our general practitioners, our psychol- 
ogists—and perhaps also our legislators, a very important 
group. These people should all have at least a ten-hour 
course in “What and how to teach the pre-school child” 
so that the child won’t get stalled on the way!

a sufficient number of highly trained specialized workers, 
such as psychologists, for this work. The salvation of the 
pre-school child lies in the hands of the teachers, dietitians, 
social workers, nurses and other individuals who are mak- 
ing intimate contacts with these children. It is fortunate 
that so many problems of this age can be handled very in- 
telligently by these groups and do not require more highly 
specialized workers, notwithstanding the fact that there are 
no small number of psychological problems concerning the 
life of the child which tax the skill and ingenuity of the best 
trained and most experienced psychologist. 
That is the type of thing we must get hold of. We have 
to become the masters of people, the very drivers, so to 
speak, and get over to the masses, in a big way, the same 
thing that the Department of Agriculture has given to the 
farmer. You do not find a chemist riding along the back 
of every dump cart that is carrying fertilizer, to tell the man 
how much fertilizer to use. The farmer is educated, within 
a reasonable limit, as to how to handle that particular prob- 
lem, and he handles his problem well. The government 
has taken a sufficient amount of interest in the problem of 
hog cholera and such things; it will have to take the same 
interest in getting what information we have over to the 
masses of the people, regarding the mental and physical 
health of children. 
Miss Julia Wade Abbot, Associate Director, Health 
Education Division, American Child Health Association, 
whose interest has long been in the pre-school child, came 
forward at this point with a challenge. Her subject was: 
Pre-ScHOOL OPPORTUNITIES 
Miss Abbot: 
I should like to treat this subject in a rather general way, 
although I find my tendency, in this conference which has 
dealt mainly with principles, is to revert to the concrete in 
the form of illustration. I am going to speak out of my 
personal experience, having taught some 3,000 children 
who ranged all the way from three to six years of age. I 
have had the experience of inducting these children into
-P-A-G-E-43

The Pre-school Child 35 
public and private schools. We did not call them pre- 
school children. We felt that we were doing a job that was 
a part of the school program, as this work was carried on in 
kindergartens. I think, however, that in accepting this 
term “pre-school,” which I find even kindergartners using, 
we are taking a step ahead. We are not ignoring those 
years which precede the child’s coming to school, and which 
Dr. Thom has shown us are fundamental in the child’s 
development. Dr. Gesell has said in his book, The Pre- 
school Child: ‘The kindergarten is in a strategic position, 
because it lies within this pre-school period.” Dr. Gesell 1. sonoot 
uses the term “‘pre-school” to include the period of develop- education 
ment and training before formal school education begins, 
and in this sense the kindergarten and nursery schools are 
a part of the pre-school education. 
There are two ways in which the school may regard a pre- 
school program. ‘They. may regard this period as a very 
convenient time for standardizing the child, for getting rid 
of all the disagreeable traits that thrust themselves into the 
schoolroom. For example, children would be taught to 
blow their noses in the first five years of their lives! We 
would strive to get rid of all temper signs, of all sulkiness, 
of all restlessness, of adenoids and tonsils, of all habits of 
disobedience. ‘The child would be “‘socialized” to the ex- 
tent of knowing how to walk in line, to stay passive, and 
to accept the school regime that has been mapped out for 
him. This conception of a school program for young chil- 
dren places “order” above everything else. In this connec- 
tion Miss Patty Hill has cleverly said: “If you want order 
there is nothing so orderly as a graveyard!” 
Now the school can have this conception of a pre-school 
program, but, fortunately, it will not work out this way for 
the children. You cannot make the child into a standard- 
ized product and then turn him over to the school as an 
erased tablet or an empty vessel, to which the school can 
do its worst. 
But there is another conception of pre-school education 
which I want to emphasize this morning, and which is 
striking a new keynote in education and will set the pace 
for the school itself. It is based upon the fact that this 
child who enters school has lived five or six of the most im- 
portant years of his life. Heis an individual; he is a person-
-P-A-G-E-44
eo ee 
Thinking in 
terms of the 
24-hour day 86 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
ality. He is not merely grist for the school mill. When 
the child himself is made the center of the school program, 
he will not let you ignore the characteristic behavior which 
is symptomatic of his development. He has not been bro- 
ken to the lecture method. People who teach young chil- 
dren are disciplined by having the children stand up and 
walk away if their interest is not held. Young children 
have uncomfortable ways of saying things. For instance, 
in my early teaching days, I kept reminding one little boy 
to stand up straight. I said: “Now, Horace, when I meet 
you on the street and you are a tall, straight man, you will 
be thankful that I talked to you so often about it.” He 
said, ‘Oh, Miss Abbot, you will be dead by that time!” 
You can’t ignore children; you can’t keep them still—in 
the right kind of a school. University methods are impos- 
sible at this age. An educational program for the pre- 
school age must be based upon a study of child development. 
This type of education challenges the school in another 
way. Not only must the pre-school years of the child be 
considered but we must think of the child’s life in terms of 
a twenty-four hour day. This means that everything that 
enters into his growth and development in these twenty- 
four hours is important. The school cannot dismiss him 
when school is over, as the parent so often does when he is 
in school. We cannot dismiss him when the school door 
slams and he goes into the street, the gutter, or the play- 
ground. Every phase of life that affects a child’s develop- 
ment is “education.” The modern school is concerning it- 
self with the number of hours a child sleeps. In visiting 
nursery schools the thing that has impressed me more than 
anything else, is the fact that the highly trained teachers 
in these schools regard the physical care and training of 
these young children as much a part of their work as the 
more intellectual aspect of education. The attention that 
is being given to the pre-school period is a challenge to the 
school to take into consideration the whole developing life 
of the child during the twenty-four hours of the day. 
Many valuable forms of service are being developed 
which are helping the home and the school to deal more in- 
telligently with the child. Dr. Thom has shown us the 
value of the behavior clinic to the school, in giving the 
teacher case studies upon which to begin her work with the  
-P-A-G-E-45
The Pre-school Child 37 
children, whether it is in the kindergarten or in the first 
grade. We hope that Dr. Carr of Trenton will stress 
what the pre-school clinic means to the teacher. 
Every child is different and must be treated as an individ- 
ual. As the children come to the teachers, carrying over 
into the school some records of these pre-school years, it 
tends to make the teachers individualize. It gives them a 
basis for their work. From the child’s point of view this is 
tremendously important. This is the kind of help that we 
should be giving to our teachers. In the average school, 
teachers are being overwhelmed with large classes. Kin- 
dergarten teachers are dealing with eighty or ninety differ- 
ent children a day. Teachers in the platoon schools often 
teach 200 different children during the school day. The 
larger classes are in the elementary school. We still spend 
much more money for our high schools than for our elemen- 
tary schools. 
Statistics gathered by the Bureau of Education show that 
from 25% to 30% of all the children in the public schools 
repeat their first year of work. Eighty per cent. of the 
children are tested by their ability to learn to read and are 
failed upon that basis. Think what that means from the 
mental hygiene point of view! What a sense of failure 
descends upon those children! Beginning school is a tre- 
mendously important chapter in the life of every child. 
We owe it to every child that he begin that chapter with suc- 
cess, with joy, with a feeling of achievement. This will 
only be possible when teachers are enabled to know their 
children as individuals and to base their school program 
upon their needs. This means that the home life of the 
child has to be considered. Dr. Campbell says of failure in 
school: ‘If these teachers had considered John Smith as a 
live boy, who had once been a baby, and who had. been 
brought up by a father and a mother, they would have de- 
veloped an intelligent curiosity as to the why of his failure 
instead of merely thinking of him as the victim of a curric- 
ulum.” 
Experiments in the pre-school field suggest that every 
schoolroom should be a laboratory. When the teacher is 
given the right conditions and a professional spirit is de- 
veloped, every troublesome child will be a challenge to her 
sympathy and intelligence. No longer will the teacher The school 
room as a 
laboratory 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  88 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
have the attitude, “Why was this wished upon me?” No 
longer will we hear in the lunch hour: “Are you going to 
get Charles Jones next term? I pity you. I’ve had three 
in that family and they’re terrors!” No—when teachers 
are allowed to be leaders of children, teaching becomes a 
wonderful adventure, filled with the daring and joyous 
spirit of childhood. 
Bringing the home into the consciousness of the teacher 
is as illuminating in her experience as interpreting the mod- 
ern school program to parents. In this respect the pre- 
school experiments are setting a standard for the school. 
Nursery schools are establishing study classes for mothers; 
pre-school clinics are working with parents in developing a 
healthful regime for these children. 
The modern school program has not been sold to the peo- 
ple. The average parent still thinks of the school as a 
place for giving mechanical training in the “three R’s.” 
To think that schools have anything to do with children’s 
health—that there is any advice available in relation to chil- 
dren who have tantrums or who will not eat spinach is un- 
believable! To thousands who have a “Three R Complex”’ 
there is a new idea in the concept that instead of the course 
of study being the center of education, the real center is 
child development. ~ 
The pre-school program is really beginning to educate 
fathers and mothers. I believe that there are well-springs 
in parents that are untapped because most of them are igno- 
rant and bewildered in trying to deal with their children. 
I believe that fathers and mothers are eager and hungry to 
know. I cannot join in a general condemnation of parents. 
When I think of the working mothers who will sit up all 
hours of the night to wash dresses for their young daugh- 
ters so they can appear as fresh and sweet'as the other girls, 
I believe in maternal instinct, inherent or acquired! 
I feel convinced that the most significant aspect of pre- 
school work is the discovery by parents and teachers that 
child development is the most wonderful study of all. New 
light is being thrown upon the rearing of children. Teachers 
and parents are developing a larger conception of their work. 
They are beginning to realize that every bit of humor, wis- 
dom, devotion, intelligence that they possess must be de-

voted to this work, for the rearing of children is the biggest

GertTTINnc Pre-ScHOOL CHILDREN READY FOR SCHOOL 
Dr. Carr: 
We began our pre-school work last summer, under that 
name. The health department objected to our doing pre- 
school work so we changed the name to ‘Enrollment 
Clinic.” We think this is a better name because it indi- 
cates its relation to the school and implies that it is a part 
of the school system. A special census of all children to 
be entered in school in September was secured by older 
pupils and school nurses, and a registration blank was 
filled out at the same time by the principal. The form for 
physical examination was filled out at the home visit. We 
reached the parents by circular letters. Vaccination was 
urged during the spring months and parents were asked to 
talk to their physicians about diphtheria prevention but we 
did not mention the Schick test. The school nurse made a 
home call, just before the date for the clinic, on children who 
would enter school in the fall. If we did not get a response 
from the call of the nurse, we sent an appeal card home 
through the mail or by a child in school. When the children 
had been examined, and the clinics were all over, we 
planned to devote the summer to home visits, in order to 
secure correction of defects, advise the mother in regard to 
diet, etc. We tried to teach the pupils and the par- 
ents, so that the younger children might not be handicapped 
as older children have been. 
I would like to say something about the approach to the 
mother and about the educational value of the examinations 
made by the dentist and the physician. In order to secure 
the undivided attention of both doctor and parent to the 
child being examined, I had the nurses ascertain, before the 
date for the clinic, and enter on record cards, the history of 
the child’s health habits, the family social history, etc. for 
the use of the doctor while making the examination. One 
thousand children were registered and of these we examined 
600. During the examinations 78% of the parents were 
present and we consider that an accomplishment. Trenton’s

We like to make a friend of the child who is being exam- 
ined. We have the dentists examine the teeth and make 
reports and the dentists also try to make friends of the 
children. Many times a child refuses to go to the dentist, 
but if he is a friend of the dentist, there is no trouble 
at all. The earlier the child gets acquainted with the 
doctor and the dentist the easier it will be for the child to 
have his defects corrected. 
We take up the main things in the child’s diet. We find 
out the daily amount of milk purchased for the home and 
how many glasses of milk that child takes every day. We 
do not always take the mother’s word for this. We find out 
how many quarts are actually delivered each day at her 
house. We then discuss these things with the mother, and 
try to make her feel that the doctor has all the time in the 
world to talk about her child, and we generally win her over 
to our plans. 
We take up the matter of sleep and find out the time the 
child goes to bed. We tell her the time the child of that 
age should go to bed. If the mother says her child goes to 
bed at ten o’clock, we ask her, “What time does the child get 
up?” She usually says “Ten or eleven o’clock, he sleeps 
late.” I remark that the child does not get up in 
time for breakfast. It is then that we put the point across 
that the mother should get the child up in time to get his 
breakfast; and in order to do this the child must go to bed 
earlier. 
This discussion leads to a talk on the matter of daytime 
rest. Practically none of the children get any daytime 
rest, especially through the summer. I try to emphasize 
that rest in the afternoon is very helpful. In regard to air, 
I need not talk about it to the parents. The nurse is the 
one to talk about that subject. It is useless merely to talk 
because 90% of the parents do not believe in having too 
much air. 
The daily bowel movement I always emphasize and I 
find out if the daily movement is with or without a laxative. 
The American people spend $75,000,000 a year on laxa- 
tives. 
We also get a list of illnesses which the children have had 
and that helps the teachers a good deal. Ifa teacher knows
-P-A-G-E-49
  The Pre-school Child 41 
that a child has had measles once she knows that that 
child is not likely to have them again although there are 
some children who have had them three times. If we know 
who nave had those diseases we can eliminate that disease 
as a cause of absenteeism. The last thing we get is the 
name of the family physician. That is important because 
when we come to corrective work we call up the family phy- 
sician and that is where we get our results. 
The Chairman here called upon Miss Amelia Grant, 
Assistant Professor of Nursing Education, Yale School of 
Nursing, New Haven, Conn. 
Pre-ScHoot ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 
Yate SCHOOL OF NurRSING 
Miss Grant: 
It might be a little discouraging to attend such a confer- 
ence as this, where the content and methods of health edu- 
cation are being discussed, if we did not keep the objective 
clearly before us. It is possible to teach everyone the few 
simple facts concerning personal hygiene—for they are 
simple—and enough about the cause and prevention of 
disease to insure intelligent seeking of medical advice. 
The conference this morning particularly emphasized the 
educating of parents, placing the responsibility for the health 
of the child in the homeand upon the parents. The teaching 
of health in the home has been more definitely a function 
of the nurse than the classroom teaching in the school with 
which this conference has been especially interested. 
All public health nurses are health teachers; every nurse 
should be. Nurses themselves have felt a need for broad- 
ening and supplementing their training so that they are 
better prepared to use the opportunities which they have for 
teaching. They realize that it is a definite responsibility 
which they should meet. 
The Survey of Nursing Education, made possible by 
the Rockefeller Foundation, has presented the opportunities 
of the nurse, and the recommendations for her education, 
very clearly. Ifa nurse goes into a home to make a child 
welfare visit and advises this and that food which she knows The nursery

the child should have, and if she fails to recognize the fact 
that the mother already knows that she should give the child 
green vegetables, milk, fruit, etc. and has provided for the 
child, and further that the real problem here is one of child 
training (how to develop right food habits), she has made 
an incomplete and unsatisfactory visit. She must know how 
to help the mother to get the child to eat the food he should 
have. Child training is one phase of child care. 
Doctor Wile calls regularity, obedience, industry and con- 
sideration for others the important health habits for chil- 
dren. Every one of these habits expresses the importance of 
child training. This training is begun before the child 
enters school. The habit of regularity is begun the first 
day of the baby’s ne Hie during the prenatal period. 
Those who work with babies know that the baby who has 
this training, who has a regular daily routine, is quite dif- 
ferent from the baby shot bas no training. His nervous 
and physical condition show the value of regularity. This 
is more readily noted in small babies than in older children 
because they are more sensitive to environment; but it is an 
important health habit for all ages. Each of the other 
habits, obedience, industry and consideration for others, 
is worth considering in its relation to health. The 
nursery school movement aims at developing these habits 
in the very young child and accepts the responsibility for 
parent education as well as child education. It also pro- 
vides an opportunity for the training of teachers, nurses, 
and others who work with groups of young children, as 
well as for the children and their parents. 
We are fortunate to be connected with the university 
with which Dr. Gesell is associated. He has promoted the 
development of a nursery school in New Haven which is 
to open this fall. The students in the School of Nursing 
are to have some practical experience in this school, to learn 
the needs of normal children and how to help the mothers 
in the care and training of their children. We believe 
that no person can do really good health work for children 
unless she knows something about the normal child; how 
to interest the child and get him to do his part; how to 
teach the mother the needs of the child and get her inter- 
ested to do her part; and how to teach the mother, unless   
 
-P-A-G-E-51
The Pre-school Child 43 
she already knows, how to teach and study her own child. 
This is a big order, and important enough for thoughtful 
consideration. 
The Chairman asked Dr. Fredrika Moore, Pediatrician 
of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, to con- 
tinue the discussion. Dr. Moore summed up some of the 
plans that have been suggested as a solution of the pre- 
school problem. 
MerHops oF APPROACH TO PRE-SCHOOL 
ProsLeMs oF TopAy 
Dr. Moore: 
The child enters school with his reactions to certain types 
of stimuli already formed. The teacher therefore does not 
start with fresh material, to make a new pattern. She has 
to take a pattern that is already there. It may be good or 
it may be bad. Children, when they come to school, come 
to a totally different environment. They have had no such 
experiences as those they find when they first enter school. 
Some children are more adaptable than others. Some are 
farther advanced mentally than others. Their back- 
grounds are different. Children who are more advanced 
mentally, and who have a better background, have a decided 
advantage over the others. Children who lack these ad- 
vantages are apt to develop inferiority complexes which 
will interfere with their school work and with their whole 
attitude toward life. 
The problem of the physical defects of the child when 
he enters school has already been mentioned. We may also 
keep in mind the fact that communicable diseases are ramp- 
ant during the pre-school age. 
Several solutions have been suggested for this pre-school 
problem. ‘The schools may reach back, as you have just 
heard, by making preliminary examinations. They may 
also extend their province very much farther back by estab- 
lishing nursery schools. To be sure, the nursery school in 
this country is still in an experimental stage, but in England 
it is accepted as part of the school system. There are many 
advantages in having a nursery school. It is as good for 
the “poor little rich child” as it is for the child from the Nursery 
school, Cam- 
bridge, 
Mass.

slums. We have a nursery school here in Cambridge for 
the children of Harvard professors. It has been very suc- 
cessful. It favors the formation of proper habits. It 
brings children together in a group. It seems to me that 
a requirement for entering a child in a nursery school 
should be the attendance of the mother for a certain number 
of hours at the school, or else in classes in child care. 
Another suggestion is the extension of the nursing work 
with well baby conferences and habit clinics. One way to 
get hold of little children is to follow up the birth registra- 
tions, going back as far as five years on the birth registers. 
Publicity will help solve this problem. Infant care is 
fairly well established at this time, largely through public- 
ity. You cannot take up a woman’s magazine today with- 
out reading in it something about the care of the infant. 
Why not use the same amount of publicity for the care of 
the pre-school child? 
Miss Grace Caldwell, Director of the Habit School at the 
North Bennet Street Industrial School, Boston, Massachu- 
setts, told about 
Hazsir Work witTH ForrIGN CHILDREN OF 
PreE-ScHOOL AGE 
Miss Caldwell: 
This Habit School is carried on as an educational experi- 
ment and demonstration of the value of pre-school work. 
The children are of South Italian parentage, from two to 
four years of age, and they are sent in by the health nurse 
or the doctor of the State Habit Clinic. Each child comes 
because of some already noticable behavior problem, such 
as tantrums, whining or sulking. 
The corrective work is done through an environment 
especially arranged to encourage large muscle activity—to 
give easy opportunity for self expression through a large 
variety of the right kinds of play material. There is free- 
dom from nagging interference, yet there are definite stand- 
ards of self control, which are raised from time to time, as 
the child makes progressive adjustments, until his reactions 
are apparently normal. Individual records are kept of the 
most difficult cases, showing the child’s habitual behavior, 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
  
The Pre-school Child 45 
and the methods which have been used to create right re- 
sponses and results. 
It is increasingly evident that the problem lies not in the 
individual child but in a home environment that lacks un- 
derstanding, privacy, space and quiet. In only one family 
of the children in this clinic is English habitually spoken. 
To get a child to adjust to habits of normal behavior by 
simply exposing him to normal play and impersonal con- 
trol has been so amazingly easy that the value of training 
in the pre-school years is self-evident. Our real problem 
now lies in demonstrating how much understanding and 
response can be roused in homes presenting limitations. 
The Chairman here asked Miss Louise Stanley, Chief 
of the Bureau of Home Economics, United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., to tell something 
about 
THE Pre-ScHOOL PRoGRAM OF THE AMERICAN 
ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY WOMEN 
Miss Stanley: 
Three years ago the American Association of University 
Women voted to have an educational secretary, to take 
charge of the educational program. ‘Those of us who were 
interested in training for parenthood were happy when they 
voted to put in, as a part of the educational program, the 
study of the pre-school child. The association is to have 
a secretary who will devote her full time to two pieces of 
educational work: (1) A study of the more advanced the- 
ories of primary education at the present time; and (2) a 
well-rounded program for studying the pre-school child. 
Miss Lois Meek will direct this work next year. Study 
groups among college women will be organized to examine, 
in the first project, the results of scientific research as they 
are applicable to the organization of elementary education. 
Dr. Charters has said that there is a ten years’ lag between 
the working out of theories of education and the application 
of these theories in practice. 
In the second project—the one in which we are most in- 
terested, since many of the group members will be young 
mothers—the A.A.U.W. hopes to develop a program for AAU.W. to 
study the

parent training within the group itself, and to collect and 
summarize facts in regard to the development of children 
during the pre-school period, under the leadership of a 
woman especially trained in some phase of the work. We 
have information available about children of school age, 
but the attention of adequately trained people has not been 
focused on the pre-school child. 
Several study groups were formed last year, as in St. 
Louis, where next year they hope to have a nursery school. 
The University of Chicago nursery school, developed dur- 
ing the war as a matter of convenience, will probably be- 
come a training center for young mothers and prospective 
mothers. The group has the cooperation of the depart- 
ments of psychology and home economics in the University 
of Chicago. We believe in approaching the problem from 
the viewpoint of the parent and the home. The nursery 
school should supplement the home, not provide a means 
by which the mother can shift her responsibility at an 
earlier age than is now possible. She will not do so if 
women’s organizations study the problem seriously, and 
come to see this problem of child development as a well- 
rounded whole, in which the physical, mental and moral 
health of the child must be developed as a unit. 
The Chairman asked Miss Anna Richardson, Dean of 
Home Economics, Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa, to tell 
something about the experimental course in the study and 
care of the pre-school child in that institution. 
Miss Richardson: 
I hesitate to speak on this topic, because our child labo- 
ratory has been in operation only since last January. It is 
such an infant that we are not ready to draw conclusions. 
However, it may be suggestive and point the way to the 
development of such work in colleges. 
The child care and training work at Iowa State College 
is not offered primarily for the training of teachers, but 
as a fundamental part of the education for homemaking. 
We have a group of young women there who will very 
shortly go into their own homes; at least 85% of them will 
be married within two or three years. Society has long -
-P-A-G-E-55
  
The Pre-school Child 47 
recognized the right of the child to be well born, and our 
colleges have developed courses accordingly; but only re- 
cently have we been courageous enough to demand that 
young women preparing for homemaking shall have train- 
ing in the care and management of children, under expert 
supervision. Our problem is how to furnish these college 
seniors, 135 to 150 each year, with satisfactory contacts 
with children. 
We have three “home management houses,” each house 
having a child a year or more old as a member of the fam- 
ily. Each senior spends six weeks in one of these 
houses, managing the home, and as a part of it, as- 
sisting in the management of the child. This exper- 
ience is supplemented by our child care and training 
course. A laboratory and classroom instruction course 
in child psychology is a prerequisite. The labora- 
tory has a group of eight to ten children from one and a 
half to five years of age, belonging to the faculty or living 
in the town, who come daily from 9:30 to 11:30. This 
provides opportunity for seniors to observe and assist in 
the care and management of young children. We do not 
attempt to deal with the unusual child. Our aim is to fit 
our young women, as future mothers, to deal intelligently 
with normal children. The children are well cared for 
and learn much in the matter of social adjustments, inde- 
pendence, and good habits of work and play. 
The seniors further observe these children in their homes, 
working with the mothers, in order to see the child in as 
many different situations as we can provide. 
Our girls go out as homemakers and as teachers of 
homemaking, and we hope that they will help to guide 
mothers in the simple problems of child life, and be them- 
selves better able to assume responsibility for their children. 
Miss Nancy Vance, Child Welfare Nurse, Virginia State 
Board of Health reported that the school health program in 
one county of Virginia has been a three-year program, and 
the third year has included a one week pre-school dental 
clinic for white children, which has been well attended.

  48 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
ciety, stated that this program has been carried on by the 
specific work of the school physicians and nurses and the 
general cooperation of both principals and teachers. The 
classroom teacher is considered to provide most easily and 
successfully the general health education. The special 
nutrition class work with undernourished children is for the 
present being carried on by the school nurse under the im- 
mediate direction of the nutrition supervisor. To insure 
adequate help for each nurse in establishing this work, va- 
rious private organizations have continued to cooperate with 
the public schools by «contributing the services of their 
nutrition specialists. 
The Philadelphia Child Health Society has assisted the 
health program of the schools, therefore, by: 
First, a demonstration to set forth the needs of health and nutrition. 
Second, providing practical information that will enable nurses 
and teachers to introduce such a program into the schools. 
Third, continued cooperation in extending the services of nutrition 
and mouth hygiene specialists for active work in the schools. 
Other phases of this health program, while not directly 
associated with the public schools, are nevertheless funda- 
mental for effective work in the schools. 
Miss De Planter considers that perhaps their greatest 
contribution to health education in the schools is the exten- 
sive prenatal and pre-school health work which has claimed 
so great a share of their activities in the past three years. 
Health education in the prenatal and pre-school period 
lays a sound foundation for the school health program. 
HoME CooPERATION 
In connection with the pre-school program, home cooper- 
ation is of very great importance. Women’s organizations 
are showing an increasing interest in the pre-school child 
and are trying to find out how to help the parents cooperate 
in securing a complete health program for the child. A 
piece of constructive, educational work along this line was 
reported by Mrs. Myra Frank Rosenau, President of the 
Council of Jewish Women, Boston, Massachusetts.
-P-A-G-E-57
  
The Pre-school Child 49 
Mrs. Rosenau: 
We feel that the first thing to do is to educate the parent, 
and you can’t send the parent to school to be educated. 
You can’t even be sure that parents read what you send 
home to them. I believe that parent-teacher associations 
and women’s clubs have an opportunity for the education 
of parents and other women. The organization I represent 
has been trying to put across a health education program 
for pre-school children. 
We issue to all members throughout the State, a list of 
non-technical health books for the home, which help to 
teach parents what children are like when they are healthy 
and normal. We believe that, in order to get health educa- 
tion across to parents, we must make the parents a part of 
our general plan. Through the aid of two of our members, 
Miss Frances Stern and Mrs. Harry Solomon, we pre- 
pared a little booklet of questions which a parent can ask 
herself in regard to her children, calling her attention to 
things any mother may observe, in respect to physical and 
mental condition and behavior. We ask in this pamphlet 
whether the child is given a yearly health examination. 
We lay great stress on this. The questionnaire asks a ques- 
tion and then suggests what the parent should observe in 
order to answer it. We consider that we have made only a 
small contribution, but we hope it may help a few parents 
to do their part in the general health education program. 
Mrs. Edward C. Mason, Vice-President of the National 
Congress of Parents and Teachers, Washington, 
D. C., said she was quite sure that the best cooperation 
between home and school could be brought about by Parent- 
Teacher Associations. This is especially true in districts 
where the parents are non-English speaking. Such parents 
often have little knowledge of health, low health standards, 
and they cannot learn because they do not understand the 
language. If they can be induced to come to the schools 
they will learn much by observation. 
Parent-Teacher Associations have already proved their 
usefulness and interest in health work by installing and 
supporting hot lunches, school nurses, playgrounds, and the Pre-school 
question-

like, until the community has seen their value and is willing 
to take over their support. 
The question was raised, as to just what the “pre-school 
age” is. Miss Abbot mentioned that the United States 
Bureau of Education collects statistics for children for the 
ages of five years and up. It was assumed, however, 
that pre-school might be understood to mean under six 
years. 
The conference agreed that the habits and attitudes es- 
tablished in the pre-school years play so important a part 
in school and adult life that a pre-school health program 
ought to be formulated. 
At this point the meeting adjourned. 
The summary of conclusions and recommendations on 
the subject of a pre-school child are given on page 231 of 
this report. 
C. Personal Health of the Pupil 
PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION AT A MEETING OF THE 
ADMINISTRATION SECTION 
Miss Dolfinger, Chairman 
Chairman: 
F a superintendent of schools introduces a health pro- 
gram into his schools, what benefits to the schools can 
he expect? Some of us believe he will have healthier pu- 
pils, which is a very great benefit, not only to the children 
themselves, but to the functioning of the school system. 
Dr. Thomas F. Kenney, Director of Health and School 
Hygiene, Worcester, Massachusetts, introduced the topic 
for discussion by saying that health is fundamental in 
school work. Compulsory attendance can be enforced only 
with children physically able to attend school. Sometimes 
Fatigue- the mere attendance is about all that they can do; they are 
type chil- tired without any further effort; they fall behind their 
cn classes; they fail to pass at the end of the year. In Wor-

cester, 30% of the 38,000 pupils in the schools, are of this 
“fatigue type.” Fifteen “fresh-air units” now in operation 
simply provide different living conditions, during school 
hours, for these fatigue children. They are taught how to 
relax.so as to get the full value of their rest. They have 
pleasant rooms with plenty of sunshine, and they sit wher- 
ever they please. They have exercise and are not deprived 
of anything that other school children have. As a result, 
ten out of twelve of these retarded children have not only 
“come back” but actually gone ahead of their classes. 
Chairman: 
We have been asked to discuss also the part the doctor, 
the nurse and the teacher respectively should play in the 
health examination of school children. I shall ask Dr. 
C. G. Guthrie, Medical Director of the Lawrenceville 
School, Lawrenceville, New Jersey, to tell us about health 
work under his direction and perhaps help us to define 
Tue Doctor’s Parr in HeattH EXAMINATIONS 
Dr. Guthrie said that his experience had been gained in 
a large private preparatory school for boys from 13 to 18 
years of age. A preventive medical program is carried out 
and very careful health examinations are made. The 
spring and fall examinations are similar to those usually 
given in colleges—covering heart, lungs, eyes, ears, nose, 
and throat and physical defects. ‘This examination is made 
by the medical and physical education departments in co- 
operation and three weeks are allowed for the examination. 
The second type of examination is as complete as they know 
how to make it and includes laboratory tests of blood, stools 
and urine. The physical examination requires about an 
hour for each boy. The purpose of this examination is not 
to simply collect information but to promote the boy’s 
health. 
Last year letters were sent to parents pointing out the 
need for attention to teeth, tonsils, adenoids, ears, herniae, 
appendices, circumcisions, and consultations with special- 
ists. Cooperation from parents was received in more than 
96% of the instances. Lawrence-

  52 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Dr. Guthrie said that there are boys who are very defi- 
nitely underweight, who fall behind, and find it difficult 
to live the same life physically as the other boys and diffi- 
cult to prepare their lessons. Such boys are “repeaters” at 
the infirmary and the dispensory as they have little resist- 
ance. An extra quart of milk each day (between meals 
and at bed-time) was given to these boys, and as a result 
gains of two and three pounds a week were common, and 
one boy gained five. One boy weighing 108 pounds in 
September and the same in February, and who had been 
in the infirmary three times since September, gained seven- 
teen pounds in forty-four days. In the year and a half 
since that time he has not once been admitted to the infir- 
mary. Many boys got up to their normal weight and felt 
less nervous and irritable. The results have been increased 
resistance to infection, increased resistance to fatigue, a 
better-balanced nervous system, improved scholastic work, 
any one of which has justified the effort made. 
Chairman: 
We have heard an interesting account of health work and 
health examinations in a private school. Will some one 
tell us about health examinations in the publicschools? Will 
Dr. Fred Burger, Director of Health Education in the Pub- 
lic Schools, Kansas City, Missouri, tell us something about 
HEALTH EXAMINATIONS IN Kansas City 
Dr. Burger said that the examinations for school chil- 
dren for physical defects are made by nurses (who are 
called “hygienists”) and examinations for posture by the 
teacher of physical training. When defects are found by 
the nurses, the parents are asked to take the child to the 
family physician for a complete examination. When pos- 
tural defects are discovered by the physical training teacher, 
the pupil is referred to special classes for corrective work, 
and the parents are invited to come to the gymnasium to 
observe what needs to be done for the child. Kansas City 
has 45,000 pupils in its elementary schools and forty-six 
nurses who make the examinations during the first three
-P-A-G-E-61
Health of the Pupil 53 
weeks of the fall term and after that do the follow-up work, 
for correction of defects. 
The Chairman asked Dr. Cornell to tell something about 
examinations in Philadelphia. 
Dr. Cornell: 
School inspection in Pennsylvania is performed under an 
act of the State Legislature. That determines definitely 
one thing, that the school doctor must have had at least two 
years’ experience in the practice of medicine. This has 
been a legal enactment, since 1912. 
I know of communities where good work is being done 
by nurses, but I think a doctor who is properly trained, 
and particularly interested, can do better work than a per- 
son who has not had medical training. 
We have ninety doctors and ninety nurses. The medical 
inspectors make the examinations. The nurses do the 
follow-up work. The control of contagious diseases falls 
to either one that happens to be on the spot. Generally 
speaking, I think most of the reportable diseases are found 
by the doctors, but the nurses do that also, and they take 
care of pediculosis and various skin diseases. To make 
250,000 physical examinations requires, with us, about one 
doctor to 3,000 children. One doctor could do 4;000 chil- 
dren if he does twenty children a day for 200 school days. 
I may have been mistaken, but I understood Dr. Burger to 
say that forty-six nurses examined 45,000 children in three 
weeks. 
Dr. Burger: 
The school population is 45,000. 
Dr. Cornell: 
I was calculating the amount of time given to each phys- 
ical examination. In Philadelphia there are some 330 
school buildings and ninety school medical inspectors, giv- 
ing each inspector an average of four schools. Most of 
the schools are visited on alternate days by the medical in- 
spector and the school nurse visits the schools on the days 
when the inspector is absent. The largest schools are vis- 
ited daily by both medical inspector and nurse. 
If a medical inspector visits more than one school in a Philadel- 
phia
-P-A-G-E-62
54 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
day, the work done at the last school visited includes the 
regular annual physical examinations. These require 
about five minutes per child. The nurse transcribes the 
record of physical defects found by the medical inspector 
and uses her own records in connection with her efforts to 
have the defects corrected. 
We secure the correction of about 52% of the physical 
defects found. While we take care of minor conditions 
when they are presented, every effort is made to concentrate 
Correction on the so called major defects—those that influence perma- 
of physical ently the health of the child. The work of the inspectors 
and nurses is constantly reviewed and the minor or unim- 
portant defects must not comprise more than one-eighth of 
the total. 
It is evident that the work in any two communities cannot 
be compared unless the character of the physical defects 
recorded as corrected, is carefully studied. 
The question was raised in regard to the stripping of 
children for examination. 
The Chairman asked those who lived in States permit- 
ting children to be stripped for examinations to raise their 
hands. There was a show of hands and representatives 
from North Dakota, Massachusetts and Maryland stated 
that the stripping to the waist for examination is permitted 
in these states. It was stated that while Massachusetts re- 
quires a thorough physical examination and permits the 
stripping of children to the waist, it is not being done in 
all the towns in Massachusetts. 
The Chairman suggested that the conference hear about 
other types of examinations. Miss Mary Chayer, Super- 
visor of School Nurses, Department of Health and Safety, 
Saginaw, Michigan, was asked to tell what, in her locality, 
is 
Tue Nurse’s Part IN THE EXAMINATION 
or Pupits 
Miss Chayer: 
Saginaw has a population of 65,000, with 45 public 
schools divided between two boards of education, and 15 
parochial schools. The school health work is under the  
-P-A-G-E-63
  Health of the Pupil 55 
Department of Health and Safety, which employs one full- 
time school physician, three full-time dentists, and seven 
nurses, of whom one is assigned to contagious disease work. 
It was difficult to work out our nursing program because 
we work with three groups of schools, under different school 
administrations, and because we do different types of work. 
Throughout the school year we do contagious disease work, 
detection and correction of physical defects, and give as- 
sistance to teachers in the health education program. 
Throughout the summer we have our infant, pre-school and 
general clinic work. 
As we had only one school physician it was obviously 
impossible for him to do all the examining. We finally 
worked out a plan something like this: 
The Parent-Teacher Associations do the monthly weigh- 
ing and measuring. All pupils below average weight, or 
failing to gain in weight, are referred to the physician. 
The nurse makes examination of eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
skin, scalp and general appearance, referring to the physi- 
cian every child who shows even slight deviation from the 
normal. The physician examines all children referred to 
him. As routine he examines each year all kindergarten 
and first grade children. The dentist examines each year 
all pupils in the first eight grades, using a probe and a mir- 
ror to detect the pit and fissure cavities in the sixth-year 
molars that often cannot be seen without a mirror. The 
nurse makes re-examination during the second semester of 
all pupils that have defects and again sends notices to par- 
ents. 
The nurse gives to each teacher a complete list of the phy- 
sician’s recommendations for pupils, and the teacher is ex- 
pected to aid in getting these corrections made. If parents 
have disregarded the note of the nurse, a word from the 
teacher helps out tremendously. The nurse makes home 
calls for every case of children with defects soon after she 
has sent a note to the home, and follows up these cases. 
Clinics are held in schools in five centers. These include 
infant, pre-school and general clinics. Dental clinics were 
last year available for all pupils needing help, and nearly 
every teacher in the whole system took it upon herself to 
see that dental corrections were made. Three hospitals 
and five throat specialists give throat clinic services so Nursing

necessary. Toxin-antitoxin and vaccination are admin- 
istered at school to every pupil whose parents sign a con- 
sent slip. 
The Parent-Teacher Associations are usually glad to 
look after glasses for needy pupils in their schools. 
Health supervision in our city and county has been gov- 
erned by local conditions, as it has in most places. Taking 
conditions as we found them, we feel that our nurses have 
been able to do some very good work. 
Chairman: 
What is the nurse’s relation to the doctor? 
Miss Chayer: 
She examines the children, and refers to the physician 
every child who deviates slightly from the normal in all 
grades except the kindergarten and the first two grades 
which are regularly examined by the physician; but when 
he examines he does not do any of the routine work of get- 
ting things ready. Whenever it is desirable that the phy- 
sician should make a visit with one of the nurses, he is 
notified and goes with her to examine the children she re- 
fers to him. 
Chairman: 
Is there another representative of the nurses’ group who 
has had a somewhat different type of experience, or where 
the work of the nurse is somewhat different from this plan? 
May we hear from Miss Mary B. Hulsizer, Instructor in 
Nursing Education at Teachers College, Columbia Uni- 
versity? 
Miss Hulsizer: 
I would like to know whether any definite study has been 
made of the work of the nurse and the part she should play 
in health education in the public schools? Has any study 
been made showing the types of work done by the different 
health workers in the schools, which would help us to 
determine what types of work it is best for each to continue?

Chairman: 
That is an important point. Has an analysis of the 
different jobs entering into this situation ever been made? 
Miss Anne Raymond, Special Health Teacher, Playground 
Athletic League, Baltimore, Maryland: 
I wish a job analysis could be made defining the nurse’s 
part in medical inspection, and her part in the new devel- 
opments in health education. 
Dr, Patton: 
The Public Health Committee of the New York Academy 
of Medicine has been authorized to try out four plans of 
school medical inspection, over definite periods of months 
and years up to about three years, to test out the efficiency of 
these plans. At the end of the periods of trial we ought to 
know something about the matter. 
Chairman: 
When are they to start these tests? 
Dr. Patton: 
As soon as they get the money to do it which will be, I 
think, next year. 
Chairman: 
Have you the details of those plans, Dr. Patton? 
Dr. Patton: 
The details have not fully been worked out. As I un- 
derstand it, one plan is to make a much more thorough ex- 
amination of a fewer number of children than is the present 
practice. The second plan involves doing intensive work 
with selected groups, such as 10% under-weight, the 25% 
over-weight, or children reported to be two years retarded 
in their school work. The third plan is to study those 
children who have had prenatal, infant and pre-school care 
by various agencies, to learn what benefits accrue to them 
in their school years from such care. The fourth plan I 
do not know. To test ef-

Dr. A. L. Brannock, Director of Health Education, Pontiac 
Public Schools, Pontiac, Michigan: 
Pontiac has about 40,000 inhabitants and 7,000 school 
children. I have been the Director of Health Education 
in the public schools for five years. Before that one nurse 
had done all the work that was done. I gave one hour a 
day to this work the first year, two hours a day the second 
year, and in the third year we had so much work that the 
board of education gave me a full-time job. We now have 
three school nurses. I try to make a very thorough phys- 
ical examination. The nurse does not make it; she meets 
me at the school house and assists. When I find a child 
that needs a more thorough examination than I can make 
with his clothes on, I ask permission of the parents to strip 
the child. A person cannot make many thorough examina- 
tions in a day because one gets too tired to do a good job. 
If it were possible to have one nurse to each school to thor- 
oughly inspect all children, it would help tremendously to 
keep down contagion. That is still an important part of the 
school health work. JI emphasize that and physical defects. 
I visit the homes myself. If I find some tonsils that 
need to come out (and not many do), I demonstrate to the 
family that this boy needs his tonsils out. The plan of 
talking things over with the parents has had good results. 
We have good cooperation with parents. When one nurse 
set an afternoon to talk over with fifteen mothers the defects 
of their children, fourteen out of the fifteen came to hear 
that talk. 
Dr. Carr: 
In defining the doctor’s part, one thing to be emphasized 
is that he should make a thorough physical examination of 
real educational value to the child. 
Chairman: 
We agree, I think, that one value of the examination 
for the child is the right attitude which he may get and carry 
through life. 
Miss Maud Brown, Director of Health Education, Fargo 
Child Health Demonstration, Fargo, North Dakota: 
How do the other Pontiac doctors react to your program?
-P-A-G-E-67
  Health of the Pupil 59 
Dr. Brannock: 
Very well indeed. For one thing they have more work 
to do than they ever had before. People are coming to 
see the need of having corrections made and they go to their 
own doctors to have the work done. 
Miss Brown: 
Did the physicians realize in the beginning that this 
would be the effect? 
Dr. Brannock: 
No, I don’t think they did. 
The Chairman asked if further discussion was desired. 
Dr. Burdick: 
In Maryland every high school girl and boy is examined 
every other year in the hope that in five years the teachers 
coming from that group will be free from medical defects. 
Miss Knowlton: 
In Binghamton the school children are weighed once in 
five weeks and measured at the beginning of each semester. 
The weighing is done by the children under the direction of 
the teacher. 
Chairman: 
We have not yet had presented to us the part the teacher 
plays in the health education program. I think we can in- 
clude principals and supervisors, from this angle, under the 
term teacher. I shall ask Miss Nettie Strate, Supervisor 
of Health Instruction in the schools of Minneapolis, to tell 
us what she understands as 
THE Part OF SUPERVISOR AND TEACHER 
In HEALTH SUPERVISION 
Miss Strate: 
Health education in Minneapolis is under the jurisdic- 
tion of the city superintendent of schools. A director of 
hygiene and a supervisor of physical education direct health 
education in the following four fields: Health ex- 
amination 
of pupils
-P-A-G-E-68

  60 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
1. Prevention of the spread of contagious diseases. 
2. Discovery and correction of physical defects and aids to the 
physically handicapped. 
3. Physical education. 
4. Health instruction which leads to the formation of health habits 
and community hygiene. 
Assisting the director of hygiene are an assistant director 
in charge of medical inspection and a corps of nine phy- 
sicians, one on full-time and eight on part-time; a super- 
vising nurse and a corps of three part-time dentists, three 
dental hygienists, and four oral hygienists; and a super- 
visor of health instruction. 
Miss Strate here gave some statistics for the year 1923:

  There are classes for retarded (subnormal) children; 
sight-saving classes; a school for crippled children; one 
entirely open-air school; teachers for deaf children; and 
the Lymanhurst Hospital school, all of which are related 
to the school health problem. 
By health instruction we mean any teaching, through a 
school program and home cooperation, which leads to the 
formation of health habits by the children. 
The supervisor of health instruction has two main 
duties: 
1. Directing the making of a course of study. 
2. The supervision of health instruction in the schools. 
1The school eye clinic cares for eyes of children free. The Junior Red 
Cross makes it possible for needy children to secure glasses. From July 1, 
1923 to June 16, 1924, $1590.42 was spent in this way and during this same 
period $514.32 was collected from the children,
-P-A-G-E-69
Health of the Pupil 61 
One aim of our program is to give sound instruction. A 
still larger aim is to stimulate the formation of health hab- 
its. To bring this about we try to: 
1. Create a purposeful desire in the child to form health habits, 
grow strong, keep well, and be happy. 
2. Secure the cooperation of the home. 
Throughout our work we emphasize: 
1. Keeping uppermost the positive phase of health. 
2. Teaching in each grade the main facts relating to cleanliness, 
food, fresh air, and exercise. 
3. Making twelve health habits the foundation for our health 
program.* 
4. Give definite instruction in safety education. 
5. Train children to take part in community life. 
Two and one-half years experience in this work has firmly 
convinced me that there must be a definite health instruction 
program with a regular allotment of time each week; that 
health instruction should be as definitely a part of the 
school program as English or arithmetic. Assisting chil- 
dren to form health habits is a function of the school as 
well as duty in the home. We now have an allotment of 
twenty minutes per week for the first, second and third 
grades; twenty-five minutes per week for the fourth; fifty 
minutes per week for the fifth and sixth grades. The fifth 
and sixth grade periods alternate with physical education 
and the boys and girls are segregated in these classes. 
The program for the first six grades has been followed 
during the past school year in fifteen buildings, under the 
direct supervision of the supervisor of health instruction. 
The principals of sixteen other buildings have carried on 
the work to some extent in these schools also. 
11. Hand-washing before each meal, and a full bath more than once a week. 
2. Brushing the teeth at least twice a day. 3. Sleeping from ten to twelve 
hours each night, with the windows open. 4. Drinking from a pint to a 
quart of milk daily, but no coffee or tea. 5. Eating some vegetables and 
fruits every day. 6. Drinking at least four glasses of water a day. 7. Play- 
ing for a part of every day out of doors. 8. Having a regular morning hour 
for going to the toilet. 9. Keeping pencils, fingers, and everything unclean 
out of the mouth and nose. 10. Having a clean handkerchief every day, and 
not coughing or sneezing without covering the nose and mouth with it. 
11. Keeping good posture. 12. Keeping neat and cheerful, and being helpful 
to others.

-P-A-G-E-70
General pro- 
gram 
  62 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Subject matter: 
The health rules are emphasized in each grade each 
week. The topic and aim are the same in all grades at the 
same time, although the procedures change to meet the ad- 
vancement and hold the interest of the pupils. Food hab- 
its are particularly emphasized during the eight weeks fol- 
lowing the weighing and measuring in each semester. 
We prefer to develop subjects simultaneously in all 
grades. Each grade discusses at the same time home, 
school and community cleanliness and safety, food and its 
care, water, drinking cups, fire prevention and other sub- 
jects. In the fifth grade a home hygiene text is used. The 
first two weeks in September we devote to street safety, 
since more children are killed by street accidents during 
September and October than at any other time of the 
year. 
Weighing and measuring: 
Weighing and measuring by the nurse is a project for the 
third week in each semester. Reporting the weights and 
measures to parents is a project for the fourth week of each 
semester. 
During the last two weeks of the school year the teachers 
do the weighing, total the gains for the year, and send the 
reports home by the pupils. 
Correlations : 
Health instruction is correlated with English by means 
of oral language lessons in the first, second and third 
grades; by written language lessons in the fourth, fifth and 
sixth grades; by means of jingles, slogans and health plays 
in all grades. 
Health and safety instruction are correlated with art 
work by means of blackboard drawings, paper cuttings, 
lettering and posters. 
Conferences are held with the supervisors of drawing, 
physical education, home economics, penmanship and na- 
ture study, and with the assistant superintendent of schools 
in charge of the elementary schools, to work out correla- 
tions in all these subjects. 
We correlate our health and safety instruction with “fire 
prevention week,” and use special “days” or “weeks” or
-P-A-G-E-71

seasonal events, when they can awaken greater interest in 
our health program. 
Home cooperation: 
Health instruction, more than any other instruction given 
at school, requires active home cooperation, so from time 
to time we send home handwork, lessons, or other school 
products. At practically the same time in all grades the 
same health habits are emphasized so that discussions in 
the home will center around the same health instruction for 
all children. Ten health habit cards, containing impor- 
tant facts for every member of the family, are given to the 
third grade children with the request that they take them 
home and put them up in a conspicuous place. Records 
of weights and measures are reported to parents, with sug- 
gestions for home cooperation. Health plays written by 
the pupils are presented at the Parent-Teacher Association 
meetings. 
We plan to have the health chairmen of the various 
mothers’ clubs meet with the supervisor of health instruc- 
tion once a month to discuss the children’s health and the 
best methods of cooperation. So far, the response from 
homes has been gratifying. ‘The mothers at one negro 
center gave the finest kind of cooperation. 
Supervision: 
The supervisor needs the teachers’ hearty cooperation in 
health instruction. The supervisor needs to radiate health 
and happiness. The first principle of supervision is a 
definite basis of mutual understanding of each other’s du- 
ties. The course of study helps in this, but conferences 
must be held with teachers to discuss characteristics of pu- 
pils, subject matter, standards for measuring the results of 
teaching, community needs, and the relations between teach- 
ers and supervisor. The supervisor can help by demon- 
strating good teaching and correlations. 
Outside agencies: 
The Woman’s Community Council has conducted nutri- 
tional clinics in three or four schools at a time as an exper- 
iment for two years. The National Dairy Council has fur- 
nished health educational pamphlets for distribution and Mothers’ 
Clubs
-P-A-G-E-72
  64 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
helped in dramatizations. ‘The Hennepin County Tubercu- 
losis Association has furnished pamphlets for distribution. 
The Safety Bureau of the Civic and Commerce Association 
has given suggestions on safety education. The supervisor 
of health instruction is a member of the Public School Child 
Welfare Committee whose main work is to see that needy 
public school children are clothed. 
In every case of cooperation with an outside agency, 
the subject matter to be presented by such agency, and the 
method of presentation, must be approved by the superin- 
tendent of schools. 
Texts: 
Selected reference books have been furnished each build- 
ing, especially for the first, second and third grades, as no 
basal texts are used in these grades. Text-book refer- 
ences are selected and rearranged to fit the Minneapolis 
program. 
Measurements of progress: 
The pupils’ progress can be measured by gains in 
growth, by the removal of physical defects, by the forma- 
tion of health habits, by general improvement, and by better 
social adjustment. 
The efficiency of the teachers’ work is measured by their 
support and cooperation; by the improvement in their 
pupils; by the teaching methods used to stimulate pupils 
in the formation of health habits. 
The supervisor has attempted to measure her own effi- 
ciency by the results of the work of the teachers and pupils. 
We have tried to measure the effectiveness of the super- 
vision of health education by the standards outlined for 
measuring general supervision as given by such authorities 
as Nutt and Burton. 
Health education to be effective must have scientific and 
social values. 
CoMMITTEE ON HEALTH EXAMINATION 
It was here voted that the Chair appoint a committee, con- 
sisting of four doctors, four nurses and four teachers to out-
-P-A-G-E-73
Health of the Pupil 65 
line the part to be played by the doctor, the nurse and the 
teacher in the health examination of school children. 
There were some differences in opinion as to the possi- 
bility of defining these various jobs. Dr. Cornell felt that 
the type of work to be done by each group must be governed 
by local conditions, whether there is a part-time or full- 
time school physician, and the like, and he felt that a sub- 
ject ‘‘as important as this should be given a year’s study, 
and the opinions should be gathered from all parts of the 
country.” Miss Mabel Bragg suggested that it might be 
worth while for the members of the conference to give an 
opinion as to the conditions most favorable for the medical 
inspector and the nurse to do their best work. 
The conference agreed that the committees to be ap- 
pointed by the Chair should crystallize the general opinion 
of the conference as to who best can do each part of the 
work in the health examination of children. The names of 
-the committee and their report are given on pages 233, 240. 
One member expressed himself as believing that “‘it is 
vicious to take the boys and girls we call ‘underweight’ 
and restrict them,” and called to mind a boy he had seen 
moping around home on a bright winter’s morning because 
“he was underweight and must rest.” Was he bettering 
his health by staying around home moping, instead of go- 
ing out and coasting? It was the opinion of this speaker 
that it is harmful to tell boys and girls that they are in- 
ferior or that “they must be careful, and read a book, 
and rest more.” Mental attitude has probably more to do 
with health and happiness than we can possibly think. No 
matter how much science you have, or how much you know 
about the newer knowledge of nutrition, you must get chil- 
dren to do things in order to have this information do them 
any good. The most important part of a discussion on 
milk is getting the milk inside the child and not explaining 
it by chemistry. 
Dr. Patton stated that the actual value of rest is not 
known at present. Information recently given before a 
section of the American Medical Association revealed that 
profound ignorance still exists in regard to the significance 
and extent of fatigue among children. Dr. Patton con- 
tinued, “I believe there are definite ‘fatigue types’ of chil- 
  The under- 
weight 
child and 
exercise
-P-A-G-E-74
Committee 
on health 
examina- 
tions 66 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
dren who must be recognized as such, and who must be 
given rest. Probably many children also need exercise. 
We must experiment for some time yet in order to definitely 
set new standards of activity. It is not a time to make 
dogmatic assertions.” 
Dr. Kenney said he believed that the “fatigue type” of 
child is the most important type of child we have to deal 
with in this country at the present time. 
The session at this point adjourned. 
JornT SESSION FOR THE FURTHER DIscussION 
OF THE PERSONAL HEALTH OF THE PUPIL 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
Miss Dolfinger, opening the discussion with a sum- 
mary of the morning’s meeting, said that the sense of the 
meeting was that the discussion had been too scattered to 
be of more than introductory value. The Chair had there- 
fore been asked to appoint a committee consisting of four 
doctors, four teachers, and four nurses to prepare a state- 
ment of opinion for consideration by the conference, defin- 
ing the aims of school medical examinations or inspections, 
and the conditions under which the most desirable results 
could be attained. Professor Turner was asked to an- 
nounce the members of this committee as follows: 
Miss Elmira W. Bears, Chairman. Dr. Katharine H. 
K. Wolfe, Dr. Walter S. Cornell, Dr. Alexander M. Carr, 
Dr. Edwin F. Patton, Miss Anne Raymond, Miss Mary B. 
Hulsizer, Miss Helen Teal, Miss Lillian M. Towne, Miss 
Maud A. Brown, Mrs. Florence Hobson, Miss Effie Knowl- 
ton. 
Further discussion of school medical inspection was held 
over until this committee should have time to confer and 
make a report. The report prepared by this committee 
was presented and accepted at a later meeting of the confer- 
ence, and is given on page 233 as a part of the general sum- 
mary of conclusions and recommendations.

WHAT FACTORS SHOULD AN ADMINISTRA- 
TOR CONSIDER IN THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF A HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM? 
A. Gradation of Subject Matter from Kinder- 
garten to College. 
B. Use of Sound and Effective Methods. 
Miss Dolfinger, Chairman 
Chairman: 
HE chief obstacle to the realization of health programs 
in schools today seems to lie in departments of super- 
vision or general administration, rather than with teachers. 
The administrator is not yet sure of what he can expect of 
the health program. He will probably turn its construction 
over to a committee, but he wishes to understand a little 
more clearly what should be included in the subject matter 
and what kinds of methods it is sound to employ. Perhaps 
the experience of this group may help people who are trying to 
construct such programs. Mr. A. S. Barr who is in charge 
of supervision in the Public Schools of Detroit will outline 
his conception of what the gradation of subject matter 
should be in the early grades. 
GRADATION OF SUBJECT MATTER IN 
ELEMENTARY GRADES 
Mr. Barr: 
I should like to outline the general principles underly- 
ing the organization of a health education program in the 
elementary schools. 
The people of half a century hence will probably look 
back with amazement upon our present narrow educational 
outlook. We are in a period of transition. Education of 
67 
  This is a 
period of 
transition
-P-A-G-E-76
Underlying 
principles 
and point of 
attack 
  68 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
the past century was “intellectual.” Contrary to psychol- 
ogy it treated mind as independent of body. Explanations 
of school failures were sought in intelligence. The educa- 
tion to come must be built upon the concept of unity of 
mind and body. The studies of Baldwin, Dearborn and 
others indicate that indices of school progress are to be 
found in physical growth. The old academic education 
is giving way to learning by doing. 
I have limited this paper to underlying principles, and I 
have organized the discussion under three headings: (1) 
Health education objectives, (2) suitable activities for the 
attainment of objectives, and (3) adequate measures of 
progress. 
Two general considerata to be disposed of immediately 
are: 
(1) That the point of attack in the elementary field will 
be individual or personal health (grades one to six) ; in the 
junior high school, social or community health (grades 
seven to nine) and in the senior high school, scientific, to 
give a biological, physical and chemical background 
(grades ten to twelve). (2) That instruction can be given 
in accordance with the principle of individual differences, 
that is, as far as possible, pupils be grouped according to 
physiological maturity for instructional purposes. 
The objectives to be attained in the elementary school 
may be summarized as follows: 
(1) To establish habits of right living. Habits with regard to 
diet, rest and play should be practiced until they become 
thoroughly automatic. 
(2) To eliminate physical defects. Through medical inspection 
defects of sight, hearing, breathing, teeth, etc., should be dis- 
covered and as far as possible removed. 
(3) To insure normal growth. Recent studies of school children 
have revealed the prevalence of malnutrition among children 
of all classes. This condition has by no means been limited 
to the poorer group. 
(4) Increased physical ability. The emphasis should not be, 
however, on the development of physical freaks. 
(5) To develop grace, poise and beauty of bodily movement. 
Health education might for example assist an individual 
with extreme peculiarities of gait. 
(6) Relaxation. It is just as essential to know how to relax as it 
is to carry on. If one finds himself on a “ragged edge” men- ’

tally or physically, what steps should be taken to retrieve lost 
resources ? 
To increase energy and vitality. Many individuals go 
through life only half alive. It is the business of health 
education to touch the mainsprings of power, enthusiasm 
and force. The human organism is a reservoir of energy and 
the individual must not stop at merely keeping well. 
To popularize the simple facts of medicine. To give such 
knowledge as is necessary to utilize the services of physicians, 
nurses, dentists, and other specialists. Our wide-spread ig- 
norance of simple remedial measures is a blot on an other- 
wise civilized nation. 
To develop habits of wholesome recreation. A shorter work- 
ing day has made the wise use of leisure time a national 
problem. 
To bring about an understanding of the problems of human 
relations. No subject offers greater opportunities for train- 
ing in the great social principles of fair play, honesty, loy- 
alty, self-control, self-discipline and cooperation than health 
education. 
Study activities. There are certain facts pertaining to health 
that pupils must know. 
Observational activities, either directly or through the aid of 
visual devices. 
(3) Physical activities. A survey of the health education class- 
room (the gymnasium) would lead one to believe that the 
chief emphasis in health education is physical. The guiding 
principles of their selection should be: 
a. Activities must be purposeful. As far as possible they 
should be tasks set by the pupils themselves for their own 
self-government. The aims should be to develop perma- 
nent health interest and habits of healthful physical and 
mental activity. Maximum attention should be given to 
self-direction, self-control and self-improvement. 
b. Activities must be of value to the children as children. 
Deferred adult needs should not overshadow present 
interests. 
c. Activities must be a free expression of the child’s nature. 
The emphasis should not be placed on calisthenics, formal 
gymnastics and routine drill. In general, the aim should 
be to provide opportunity for the individual to act in 
situations that are physically wholesome, mentally stimu- 
lating and satisfying, and socially sound. 
The health education program should include: 
(1) Health habit work. 
(2) Daily attention to height and weight. Objectives 
and activi- 
ties 
 
-P-A-G-E-78

(3) Medical inspection with individual attention for those that 
need care. 
(4) Physical examination with corrective gymnastics for those 
that need it. 
(5) The purposeful study of health problems, with emphasis 
upon individual responsibility for health. 
(6) Physical activities with an abundance of play, that is, 
(a) skipping, running, leaping, climbing, dancing; (b) 
games, sports and athletics; (c) scout activities, camping, 
week-end hiking. 
Mr. Barr continued, saying: 
Objective measures in terms of ultimate ends need to be 
established. Such measures as are used should measure 
ultimate values rather than subject matter goals. Take an 
example from the field of safety education. Safety educa- 
tion has to do with the saving of human lives. The only 
real measure of safety education is whether the instruction 
really saves lives. If a statistical study of accidents shows 
300 lives lost by accident in 1916; 250 in 1918; 200 in 
1920; 150 in 1922 and 100 in 1924, the instruction has 
produced results. It is of no value to know that pupils 
can repeat by memory the seven rules of safe living or pass 
successfully examinations on books read. 
Health education also has to do with the saving of lives. 
Does a statistical study of your school show: (a) Fewer 
deaths among school children, (b) fewer absences because 
of illness? 
The Chairman next introduced Miss Maud Brown, Di- 
rector Health Education, Fargo Child Health Demonstra- 
tion, to speak on the 
GRADATION OF SuBJECT MATTER 
Miss Brown: 
By the time the child enters kindergarten he should know 
the geography of his own body, that is, an accurate, scien- 
tific decent noun with which to designate every part of his 
external anatomy. He should be given the verbs to desig- 
nate the various functions of the parts of the body as soon 
as he asks questions. 
Children who come to the kindergarten teacher differ 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  Subject Matter and Methods 71 
very widely as to their equipment in the matter of personal 
geography. The kindergarten teacher will need to even 
them up, as to vocabulary, in order that they all may under- 
stand the common conversations. 
The kindergarten should fix the daily routine of health 
essentials in the child’s mind by playing very simply, dram- 
atizing the daily repetition of the health essentials. This 
dramatization of the daily routine of health essentials 
should continue through the first and second grades—va- 
ried in every conceivable form—woven in and out through 
all projects, till no cell can ever forget its part in it. 
The gradual accumulation of more and more information 
concerning the reasons for carrying out the essential health 
program extends through the third, fourth, and fifth grades. 
This will involve much biological nature study and will 
result in the possession by the end of the fifth grade of a 
substantial working knowledge of the child’s own ma- 
chinery. 
It is as great an insult to a child’s intelligence to deny 
him the knowledge of the marvels of his own intricate mech- 
anism as to expect a boy to run an automobile by rote. 
Both the human body and the automobile can be run with- 
out understanding the machinery. You can simply run 
into the garage when you begin to hear a knocking or your 
engine begins to miss and have the mechanic (or the doctor) 
fix you up. But what live boy wants to? And average 
boys are just as interested in the working of their own in- 
sides as in what goes on under the hood of an automo- 
bile. Only we know so much more of the whys of the auto- 
mobile—and the whys of the automobile stay true—while 
those concerning our own functioning change with each 
new discovery. This can be managed so as to add zest to 
the quest for the live youngster. And it is comforting to 
know that the essentials of health remain as essential as 
when they were first empirically determined. 
The child should all along learn to watch his own prog- 
ress in health as measured by the scales, and by a carefully 
graduated series of strength tests, stunts and games sup- 
plied by the physical education department.

civic health, home making and public health courses be- 
ing especially emphasized in the seventh and eighth grades. 
It is to be hoped that along with human physiology has 
gone the comparative physiology which a real teacher can- 
not well avoid; that pet families have been raised in the 
schoolrooms and that experimental plant nutrition studies 
have been carried on; and perhaps best of all, that the 
children have learned to raise one kind of animal, chickens, 
rabbits, pigs, anything for commercial purposes, and to 
make a financial success of it. Incidentally, I know of no 
better way to clean up the topic of reproduction than to at- 
tack it thus, in the impersonal dollar-and-cents light. 
If all this has been done in the grades, the boy or girl will 
enter the high school with all the facts necessary to keep 
him and his family well and have a real feeling of his 
dignity as a human being, and of the responsibility that 
his place in nature entails. High school can then be de- 
voted, as high school should be, to technical courses usually 
deferred till college. The boy and girl should be equipped 
with all the knowledge necessary for abundant, happy and 
efficient living. 
The Chairman next introduced Miss Mary A. S. Mugan, 
Assistant Superintendent of Schools, Fall River, Mass., 
who spoke on 
SomME EssENTIALS IN THE COURSE OF STUDY 
IN HEALTH EDUCATION 
Miss Mugan: 
Before one can say anything at all about developing a 
course of study or about the gradation of subject matter 
from the kindergarten through the university one must re- 
peat the objectives that have now become the main issues in 
health education. These objectives, as I had intended to 
state them, have already been given by Dr. Barr and Miss 
Brown in another form. I think of them expressed as fol- 
lows: Whatever the grade, or the subject matter, or the 
activity, health education 
(1) Should aim toward developing the right attitude toward per- 
sonal and public health;
-P-A-G-E-81
  
Subject Matter and Methods 73 
(2) Should provide opportunities for forming health habits; 
(3) Should build up by degrees a body of information that will 
help toward the conservation of the health of the individual 
and of the community. 
Until a very short time ago the schools taught something 
about anatomy and physiology but very little about foods 
and right habits of eating. Children could describe the 
bony framework of the body yet they often had poor habits 
of posture. One might enumerate many details of the the- 
oretical, academic procedures of former days and contrast 
them with the practical activities of the modern classroom. 
Children today may not be able to name the bones but they 
can tell about bone-making material that has gone into their 
diet. They may not be able to locate muscles and tendons 
but they have developed a habit of outdoor exercise. The 
attitudes and habits they are acquiring today are of extreme 
importance to the individual and to the race. Information 
is important too, but today it comes into the child’s con- 
sciousness through concrete life situations which are capital- 
ized in every grade as the basis of information. 
Throughout the entire school course it is necessary that 
there should be the following: 
(1) Weighing and measuring of each pupil at regular intervals to 
find out how near he is keeping to the standard measures and 
to do anything that may be needful in case he is not. 
(2) A thorough examination by the school physician to find out 
what remedial measures are needed. A systematic record of 
these examinations should be kept by the teacher. 
(3) The establishment of cooperative relations with the parents so 
that the school and the home will pull together constantly in 
the campaign for better health. 
Lower elementary grades 
Since the chief result of health teaching should be habit 
formation, the good teacher proceeds to make health and 
strength a real joy. It is really a delight to watch children 
taking part in a health lesson which proceeds with the help 
of play, rhyme and story and which takes up with zest the 
rules of the game which are the basis of health training. 
Practically all the health instruction of the kindergarten 
and primary grades can be grouped around these central 
ideas. Essentials 
in all grades  
-P-A-G-E-82
  A class 
project in 
Fall River 
  74 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Good teachers have learned that the method of ap- 
proach is all-important and they are constantly seeking and 
finding ways of getting children to follow these rules and 
at the same time to follow lines generated by their own in- 
terests. Much is being accomplished by the teacher in the 
lowest grades often in the face of indifference and opposi- 
tion on the part of the parents. Much is being done by 
way of example. We are glad to know that the nor- 
mal schools are doing so much for the training of the 
teacher, teaching her how to conserve her own health 
and be a good example to the children with whom she 
works. 
Grades four to six 
It is taken for granted that the weighing and measuring 
continues through these grades and that the cooperation of 
parents is obtained. This is the time, in these middle 
grades, to begin teaching something about community 
health and sanitation. How to prevent the spread of con- 
tagious diseases should also have some attention in these 
grades, largely through the problem method. A class in 
Fall River made a study of absences in their school caused 
by colds, diphtheria, and other contagious diseases. Ques- 
tions soon arose as to the causes and prevention of these 
diseases, what science has done for the decrease in the num- 
ber of deaths from typhoid fever, diphtheria, and the like; 
and what responsibility each person has for his own health. 
At this point the teacher can begin to develop the children’s 
sense of responsibility toward the community. No public 
health agency is ever able to do all that it could if it had 
the cooperation, instead of the opposition, of the community 
it wants to help. Children should get the feeling that every 
citizen ought to have, of knowing how to participate in 
public health activities, and of being willing to stand back 
of all public health movements. 
Junior high school 
Science, history, geography and every other subject stud- 
ied offers opportunities for correlation with health teaching. 
Some junior high schools learn about the problems Dr.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Subject Matter and Methods 75 
Grenfell tried to solve in Labrador, and Pasteur in France. 
Children of this age are hero worshippers; stories, there- 
fore, of real persons who became heroes for the welfare of 
the race have very great force. 
We should make use of a situation as it arises in instruc- 
tion and health projects. A general science teacher 
found that a boy was using a headache medicine. The 
class analyzed it and found its constituent proportion of 
acetanilid. A simple lesson was given on heart depres- 
sants. The children were intensely interested. In the 
school cabinet they placed samples of several kinds of so- 
called “headache cures” with brief labels telling why each 
is harmful. The common causes of headaches were also 
discussed, and measures for prevention. The same class 
made some analysis of red candy and found enough aniline 
dye in one stick to color a piece of cloth as large as a half- 
sheet of letter-size typewriting paper. This, too, was la- 
beled and made a part of the exhibit. 
Our teachers are looking for the human approach to 
every project. In a class about to study the geography of 
Australia, the teacher wrote on the board a paragraph from 
John Masefield’s “Gallipoli” which she had enjoyed as a 
human piece of literature, saying she thought the pupils 
would like it. Masefield speaks of the splendid troops 
from many parts of the British Empire he had seen arriv- 
ing at Gallipoli, mentioning in particular a regiment of Aus- 
tralians with magnificent physiques and their manly bear- 
ing: “They carried themselves like the kings in old 
poems.” The pupils discussed this paragraph with real in- 
terest. Why did those Australians look like the “kings in 
old poems?” What is their heredity? Their occupations? 
What were their foods? What climate and other condi- 
tions combine to make the people of this region so physi- 
cally fit? These questions furnished the teacher with ma- 
terial for health teaching, as well as for the geography proj- 
ect that was her objective. 
The assemblies, the hiking clubs, and the many intra- 
curricular and extra-curricular activities of the junior high 
school program lend themselves admirably to health teach- 
ing. The human

  76 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Senior high school 
In the general science work, in the gymnasium work, 
and in many other departments of the senior high school 
there are endless opportunities for direct health teaching. 
We are glad to know that the normal schools are beginning 
to teach teachers how to conserve their own health and be 
a good example to the children with whom they work. 
Summary ; 
After all, there can be no sharp lines of cleavage in the 
subjects taken up in any part of the school system. We all 
realize that from the kindergarten to the university, the 
essentials must be studied in every grade, but in different 
ways. ‘The little kindergarten child may be learning her 
health habit of drinking milk. A sixth grade boy may be 
reporting to his class, after a trip in the country, on the 
measures the farmer takes to keep his cows healthy; and 
what other precautions he must take to keep the milk 
supply pure. An eighth grade girl may have visited 
groceries or dairies and found out what are the essen- 
tials of cleanliness for places where milk is sold. In the 
high school, chemical tests may be given to show the effects 
of sterilizing and pasteurizing milk. In the university, a 
professor may be conducting, with his students, research 
work to determine the effect of a milk diet upon children 
and adults. 
The hopeful feature of the modern health teaching is 
that it is really functioning in all the grades, from the lowest 
to the highest, in getting young and old students to have a 
live interest in their own physical well-being and in the 
health of the community. 
The sincere and live interest that is generated in the 
children of the elementary grades, as well as in the more 
advanced students, is due to the fact that not didactic the- 
ories but activities closely allied to life situations are the 
basis of health instruction today. Pupils are observing, in- 
vestigating and forming good habits because of the urge 
within themselves which furnishes the driving force that 
really gets results.

Subject Matter and Methods 17 
Discussion: GRADATION AND CHARACTER OF 
Supyecr MATTER 
(1) What are health essentials? 
(2) What should be the approach in the different 
grades? 
(3) To what extent should information about disease 
be given? 
The Chairman then asked for further discussion of the 
gradation of subject matter. 
Miss Lida Lee Tall, Principal of the Maryland State 
Normal School, at Towson, Md., mentioned the gradation 
of subject matter as prepared by a committee for use in 
their demonstration school: 
In the first grade health habit work, with reports checked by 
the teacher and by the parent at home. 
In the second grade, a continuation of health habit work; 
the project of building Mary Gay’s house; and reading lessons 
based on health. 
In the fifth grade, the child is first introduced to physiology. 
The subject matter given is such as grows out of activities and 
is meant to give a basis for the understanding of health habits. 
In the sixth grade, hygiene is taught according to an outline 
worked out by a student teacher. 
In the seventh, a health play is given and health is talked at 
the daily assembly. 
Miss Lillian M. Towne, Master, Bowdoin School, Boston, 
Massachusetts : 
May I ask Dr. Barr how much time is allotted in the in- 
dividual programs for health education in various cities? 
Dr. Barr: 
The amount of time given to health education in the ele- 
mentary schools in Detroit is thirty minutes a day. Health 
education is put on the same basis as any other subject. The 
junior high schools have a sixty-minute period every day 
in the week, one hour of which is devoted to health educa- 
tion, and the other four to physical education. The sen- Demonstra- 
tion school

ior high schools have three hours a week, and what health 
education work we get in is taken out of that three hours. 
The pupils are not graded in health education; that is, a 
pupil does not fail because of his health education work. 
The health habit work is often done by the home-room 
teacher (in platoon schools), whereas the gymnasium, in 
my opinion, is the more suitable place for this work. The 
health habit, or knowledge side, and the activities, or gym- 
nasium side, of health education are now divided. The 
platoon plan assumes that they should be united under a 
specialist in health education for each school. In most of 
the classes in the junior high schools, there is a special 
teacher who does nothing but teach health. In one school 
where we have had two teachers, a man and a woman, both 
had specialized in physical education, but had also had ex- 
cellent marks in health education and hygiene and were rec- 
ommended to us as being well fitted to teach the regular 
health work. 
Miss Raymond said she believed that many teachers are 
interested only in teaching subject matter. Many times a 
teacher has a chance to teach health, but fails to see her op- 
portunity; or she teaches something from a book and thinks 
that is health education. 
Dr. Barr: 
One of the arguments supporting the teaching of health 
by the home-room teacher was that all teachers ought to 
know more about health education. 
Miss Raymond: 
Do you have a central period when all the teachers come 
together and get enthusiasm for health education? 
Dr. Barr: 
The platoon school provides for bringing them together. 
Miss Brown: 
What is the average number of pupils for which the 
home-room teacher is responsible?
-P-A-G-E-87
Subject Matter and Methods 79 
Dr. Barr: 
Eighty pupils for the average teacher; forty in the morn- 
ing and forty in the afternoon. One group comes in for 
an hour and a half, then there is a shift and another group 
comes in. 
Chairman: 
Dr. Barr has given us some very interesting leads that we 
ought to follow up while we still have the opportunity to 
do so. 
I wonder if any of you would like to know more about 
this question that has been running through my mind, as 
to how teachers in the classroom follow up weighing, meas- 
uring and other physical activities aside from the regular 
health lessons that have been outlined. May I ask 
Dr. Barr if there is any provision in Detroit for assist- 
ing the teachers to see how they can make effective edu- 
cational use of the weighing and measuring of the chil- 
dren? 
Dr. Barr: 
Let us take the question of height and weight first. The 
height and weight examinations under the present arrange- 
ment are taken care of by the home-room teacher in the 
following manner. Each pupil is taught to measure his 
height and weight and his growth in each. We take up the 
question of illness and the number of absences from school 
due to illness. We take up the question of normal growth, 
with height and weight measures; physical defects is an- 
other topic; others are physical ability, safety education, 
and the question of energy and vitality. Our courses of 
study are organized around these large topics and the work 
is taken care of in the home-room. ‘The height and weight 
measurements are taken care of by the home-room teacher; 
that is, the original measurement is made by the teacher; 
after that, the children take their own height and weight 
measurements. 
Miss Mugan: 
In trying for the prizes offered by the American Child 
Health Association, certain teachers worked out some inter- Follow-up

and meas- 
uring

esting experiments. In our city we hope to inaugurate next 
fall a better health program. We will have the advantage 
of having a physician who has been trained at Columbia 
University who will work with the board of health and with 
the school department. In all grades we have been trying 
to get correction of the physical defects which the doctor’s 
examinations disclosed. The teacher makes a memoran- 
dum of what is needed and follows up each case until the 
defect is corrected if possible. 
In all our health work, we ask the cooperation of the 
parents at once. Sometimes, especially during a depres- 
sion, as at present, which is felt in all textile cities, we 
know that the child is underweight simply because the 
families have not enough money for the proper nutrition. 
The teachers, themselves, have been active in contributing to 
cases that need special help. Relief work of most effective 
character is being carried on by private citizens and or- 
ganizations. Free milk is given in the schools to children 
who cannot pay what the other children pay for mid- 
morning lunch. We follow up every case even where we 
meet with direct opposition from the parents. You all 
know the kind of thing the teacher sometimes meets when 
she tells an anemic child that he needs to keep his window 
up at night. Too often the child reports that his parents 
will not permit the opening of windows. Constant keeping 
up the struggle for the right thing on the part of the doctor, 
the nurse, the teacher and the children themselves, finally 
brings results. 
The children weigh themselves frequently, but there is a 
systematic weighing and measuring twice a year, recorded 
on their cards. 
Miss Brown asked Miss Mugan regarding the number 
of school nurses in Fall River. Miss Mugan replied 
that they have had only three, but they hope to have more 
in the fall. The board of health sometimes helps them 
out. 
Chairman: 
Can you use the “Rules of the Game” and choose your 
subject matter in relation to them?
-P-A-G-E-89
  
Subject Matter and Methods 81 
Miss Mugan: 
My thought is that all the primary education can be 
grouped around those eight rules. It is my firm conviction 
that all we need to teach is contained in those eight rules. 
Miss Nancy Vance, Child Welfare Nurse, State Board of 
Health, Richmond, Virginia: 
I think those rules cover all the necessary points. 
Chairman: 
Miss Brown raised a point which many people are fond 
of discussing, and that is the use of nature study to develop 
the biological study of health. I am sorry that Dr. Jean 
Broadhurst of Teachers College, Columbia University, was yature 
prevented from coming to this conference. She was to study to de- 
have read a paper dealing with the importance of nature Justa” 
study as the backbone of much of the subject matter in study of 
this program. Nature study, through the care of animals, Heels 
provides a good background for health information. 
Dr. Broadhurst raised this question for discussion. Na- 
ture study started out sponsored by everybody and was un- 
dertaken with great enthusiasm. It later fell into disrepute 
because it was not taught from the point of view of develop- 
ing a functional knowledge of organisms, and because the 
choice of subject matter was not carefully worked out. 
There was much repetition of the same thing and from the 
same viewpoint, instead of from different viewpoints 
adapted to the needs of the children. Dr. Broadhurst said, 
“T hope the conference will think about the development of 
subject matter in health education. The same fundamen- 
tals must be taught from year to year; but they must be 
taught with different material and with different points of 
view according to the age of the children.” 
Chairman: 
Another question which might be asked in connection 
with this discussion of subject matter is what we mean by 
health essentials? 
Miss Brown: 
I mean a daily health program which contains every- 
thing that the well child has to do in order to stay a well
-P-A-G-E-90
  82 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
child, and to become stronger and stronger. I should pre- 
fer to make him do possibly one thing that he could get 
along without, rather than omit something that is essen- 
tial. 
Chairman: 
When you do decide to leave out something, is it because 
a knowledge of the details is not necessary to the child’s 
understanding of why he should do a certain thing? 
Miss Brown: 
There is one group of topics which deals with those things 
that are absolutely essential to a child’s actual functioning; 
another group of topics that a child ought to know as a mat- 
ter of nature study, science, or general information, but 
could grow up to be an efficient citizen without knowing. 
If we have to leave out anything, it should not be any of 
the things essential to the child’s functioning. 
Miss Mugan: 
Is there anything to be taught in the first four grades 
that could not be grouped around the “Rules of the Game” 
as we know them? 
Miss Knowlton: 
I should say that accident prevention does not come un- 
der these rules; we include this in our instructional work 
throughout the first six grades. 
Miss Raymond: 
I believe these health rules are simple and effective for 
every grade. The simpler we keep our health program the 
better. 
Miss Abbot: 
I want to ask Miss Brown if repetition to the children of 
the same fundamental practical principles of human liy- 
ing is not necessary. 
Miss Brown: 
My point was that there is a good deal that goes into a 
physiology course that belongs in other courses: ethics,
-P-A-G-E-91
Subject Matter and Methods 83 
and other subjects not having to do strictly with the func- 
tioning of the body. 
Dr. Cornell: 
I had an interesting experience during the last year, serv- 
ing on a committee for the revision of the course in hygiene, 
and I will just repeat one or two high spots in it. 
The first six grades were revised first, and the thought 
of the committee, without any real division, was that in- 
struction in the first six grades should be health habits, 
building them in the first three grades, and in the next 
three teaching the reasons why. In the fourth, fifth and 
sixth grades we introduced enough of physiology and anat- 
omy to cover the main systems of the body. When the 
committee met again—a somewhat different committee— 
to write up the course of study for the junior high, a battle 
royal ensued, but we finally agreed that in the first two 
years of the junior high school (grades seven and eight) 
we would give anatomy, physiology, health habits (includ- 
ing the projects that bring them out), and abnormal con- 
ditions; and in the third year we would review the health 
habits, stressing the personal value of posture and the civic 
value of the health habits. 
Chairman: 
In the elementary school if you have a period devoted to 
health education are you going to stop there? Are you not 
going to use all the other resources in the curriculum? In 
those four grades, can you give the attitudes that you want 
little children to have by confining yourself to any one sub- 
ject? Is it not necessary to use also the social sciences, the 
natural sciences, and many of the arts? It seems to me that 
that is a matter we have not touched so far. It is a mat- 
ter of great importance and one which I think it would be 
valuable for us to consider. 
Mrs. Ora Hart Avery, State Supervisor of Home Eco- 
nomics, State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia, 
then mentioned the health education work done by home 
economics teachers, especially in nutrition. In Virginia

up to proper weight. ‘They are sufficiently well trained in 
nutrition work to know that they must call in a physician 
whenever there is trouble to which they cannot attend. 
They constantly stress health habits in this nutrition work. 
Home economics furnishes subject matter for a great deal 
of health teaching. 
Dr. Guthrie mentioned the fact that it is possible to get 
results not anticipated, with pupils who are impression- 
istic and open to suggestion. They develop symptoms, 
just as medical students frequently do, when they hear 
diseases discussed. ‘There are other pupils who use a little 
health knowledge—just as they do any other kind of knowl- 
edge—to establish their superiority as an authority. on 
health matters! Unfortunately it is often interpreted by 
these boys as establishing immunity also. ‘That disease 
does not trouble me. I know all about it!”’ It seems ex- 
traordinary, but it isso. We must understand the make-up 
of our children and work so as to offset these two possible 
undesirable effects of a negative type of health instruction. 
Dr. Wolfe replied that medical schools must teach dis- 
eases, their diagnosis and treatment; and it is true that 
medical students often think they have the diseases they 
study. The aim of health education in the schools however 
is to teach health in a constructive way so that this matter 
of suggestion will make for health, not disease; this is one 
great reason for teaching positive, constructive health. 
The Chairman asked if this did not represent the general 
attitude of those present. 
Dr. Andress replied that there is danger in leaving out all 
teaching in regard to diseases but such teaching ought not to 
come before the eighth or ninth grade and with it should be 
associated stories about real people who have fought and 
conquered these diseases. ‘We should have a note of vic- 
tory in it, and not the kind of suggestion that will lead us to 
imagine we have symptoms of diseases. We must teach the 
symptoms of diseases, however, or we will have a course 
which is not effective. With the knowledge of the nature
-P-A-G-E-93
  
Subject Matter and Methods 85 
of certain diseases we must learn how we can meet them 
effectively, and how man has done it.” 
Chairman: 
You are right; because there lie some of the most splendid 
tales of courage and of research possessed by the human 
race. ‘There lie the ideals that we want to put before the 
children. The emphasis should be on victory. 
There being no further discussion, the meeting then ad- 
journed until the evening session. 
Jotnt MEETING For FuRTHER Discussion 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
Miss Dolfinger in opening the discussion said: ‘The 
meeting this morning indicated very clearly the value of the 
morning session as a place to clear the ground and get at 
the points most important for further discussion at a general 
meeting. Iam going to give you a kind of synthetic presen- 
tation of this morning’s discussion, in which our committee 
has tried to put together the different points brought out, 
partly for the discussion tonight, and partly as a basis for to- 
morrow’s discussion of more specialized programs.” 
Miss Dolfinger here read the summary which is printed 
on page 228 of this report. 
The Chairman asked for further discussion. 
Dr. Iago Galdston, Secretary of Health Speakers Service, 
New York Tuberculosis Association: 
I notice that you make the subject of scientific back- 
ground the last thing. I fear we have too much of this 
“Johnny-brush-your-teeth” without telling him why he 
should do so. 
I should like to emphasize also the value of experiments 
which can be carried on, not only in laboratories of research 
workers, but also in the classroom. In one classroom I 
used white mice. Plants also can be used in the classroom 
for experimental purposes. ‘There are many other such 
things which are not expensive and do not entail too great 
effort, which can be used for demonstration, and these are 
not limited necessarily to the grades from the ninth through 
the twelfth. You can use this method as well in the fourth Scientific

grade, and perhaps better, because the children there are 
more curious and enthusiastic. 
Chairman: 
I should like to answer some of the points just brought 
out. In the first place, we feel that the scientific back- 
ground ought to begin with the kindergarten and go straight 
through the period of school years. 
But in regard to making experiments, few schools have 
the necessary facilities and equipment and not all teachers 
can be depended upon to carry out experiments. It is ne- 
cessary to have specialists for leaders in such work. Some- 
times an elementary school teacher can do this sort of thing 
but almost never is she properly trained to handle it ade- 
quately. The greatest problem we have to face, before 
we can have adequate scientific presentation of this type 
of material in our schools, is to include more solid biology 
in the training of teachers in the normal schools. Few 
normal schools have courses which give a teacher any con- 
ception of plant and animal physiology. We have to con- 
sider the practical at the present time. Yet there is no 
question but that the ideal is the one set forth. 
Dr. Don M. Griswold of Iowa State University asked 
where the teacher who has this scientific background is to 
come from if we teach our normal school or college hy- 
giene as a freshman course, before she has had any sci- 
entific training. The subject of freshman hygiene, he said, 
had been discussed in the teacher training section that 
morning.* 
Chairman: 
In the training of teachers to teach hygiene, we should 
give them a thorough and sound scientific training in the 
first two years of their college work and have courses in 
methods later. Only so shall we have available teachers 
who can give a sound basis to their teaching. 
Dr. Andress: 
I should like to ask a question about correlation in high 
school work. One great difficulty with correlation is that 
1See page 177.
-P-A-G-E-95
Subject Matter and Methods 87 
sometimes we don’t get the thing that we want to get. I 
agree perfectly with what was said in regard to correlation. 
But if we are going to trust entirely to correlation to carry 
us through, whether it is in the elementary school, junior 
high school, or high school, if we are going to “carry all of 
our goods in one basket,” I don’t believe we shall get very 
far. We must broaden the concept and increase the in- 
terest of the individual pupil. We can’t afford to leave 
out of the high school curriculum those courses that are 
sound and systematic along the lines of health and hygiene. 
Chairman: 
The general organization now used in high schools is the 
stumbling block there. Most high schools have a depart- 
ment of physical education which is the only department 
in the school to which every student reports. The faculty 
is so limited that it simply isn’t possible to teach every- 
body hygiene. The result is that nearly always the health 
education work is turned over to the physical training de- 
partment. This appears to be a rather weak system, but 
is evidently a common system in operation all over the 
country. Our suggestion is that some program of correla- 
tion is necessary to supplement the health education work 
that is done by departments of physical education in high 
schools. 
Dr. Andress: 
In a great many cases, high schools have only an hour’s 
work a week of physical training, throughout a whole 
year. 
Chairman: 
Do you consider that adequate? 
Dr. Andress: 
No, not adequate; but better than nothing. The diffi- 
culty is to find a focus around which to gather these boys 
and girls every year, not just one year. 
Dr. Carr: 
In regard to white mice, I do not believe our board of 
education has money for such things, though it provides The diffi- 
schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-96

tion 88 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
us with a good many things,—it now has a revolving fund 
for paper towels and soap for our janitors and teachers. 
Chairman: 
Something occurs to me in connection with the white 
mice. I was on a committee appointed by the National 
Education Association. We were to suggest some of the 
ways in which nature study could be used and one of the 
suggestions was that animal pets be brought into the class- 
room and a study of them made there. The objection was 
made by several physicians that it was unhygienic to have 
animals in the class room, and we ought not to interfere 
with the health program! 
Dr. Craven asked whether there had been any discussion 
on sex education, and the reply given was that this subject 
had not been taken up specifically, sex education being pro- 
vided for by analogy in the development of plant and ani- 
mal life. Dr. Craven was of the opinion that it would be 
well to consider at some time a program of sex education 
from the first grade up. 
Miss Jean: 
We have been extremely careful to keep out of the field 
of sex hygiene because of the Social Hygiene Association, 
which is already handling that problem in an admirable 
way throughout the country. It has therefore not seemed 
advisable for us to go into that field, though we heartily 
approve of the work. 
There being no further discussion of the gradation of 
subject matter, this topic was concluded at this point. 
The summary of conclusions and recommendations as to 
gradation of subject matter and effective methods in health 
education are given on page 228 of this report.

PRELIMINARY DiscussION BY ADMINISTRATION SECTION 
Miss Dolfinger, Chairman 
HE Chairman continued: We will discuss first the 
school system in which there are specialists; after 
that, the system in which there are very few or no special- 
ists. Miss Mary McCormick, Supervisor of Nutrition of 
School Children, New York State Department of Educa- 
tion, Albany, New York, will speak to us on the subject of 
THe NUTRITION SUPERVISOR IN THE SCHOOLS 
Miss McCormick: 
O the average layman, a specialist is a person sum- 
moned for special services on extraordinary occasions. 
ed sooner we cease to speak of our school health officials 
s “specialists,” the sooner we shall begin to think clearly 
about the organization of our health program. We must 
develop the conviction that health is one of the regular sub- 
jects in the curriculum and that those persons trained in the 
various phases of health are regular members of the faculty. 
If we wish our school superintendents and boards of edu- 
cation to accept this Atami we must first believe it our- What is a 
specialist?
-P-A-G-E-98
Duties of 
the nutri- 
tion super- 
visor 
  90 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
selves, employ language that will express the thought, and 
then make recommendations that are consistent with our 
beliefs. 
Research work has demonstrated conclusively that good 
nutrition is essential to normal growth and to health. For 
the construction of sound teeth and bones, of organs, mus- 
cles, nerves and skin, chemical substances in adequate 
amounts must be supplied. If all foods were identical in 
composition and richly supplied with all the necessary 
elements, no choice would be necessary. Since foods differ 
profoundly in their chemical composition, an intelligent 
choice is imperative. Surely children have a right to a 
knowledge of their nutritive requirements; surely the les- 
sons given to them should be based on facts established by 
science and not on notions. 
Instruction in the nutritive requirements, and the estab- 
lishment of good food practices in school children, ought 
to be a regular part of the school program. We have on 
our school faculty supervisors of music, supervisors of art, 
supervisors of physical training. We should have also a 
well trained supervisor of nutrition. Her duties will vary 
according to the kind of nutrition program adopted. The 
nutrition program that seems to me to be most fundamental 
and comprehensive, is one that reaches every boy and girl 
in every grade. 
Her duties are similar to the duties of other supervisors. 
As she will reach every child through the teachers, her first 
responsibility will be to improve the quality of instruction 
in nutrition given by the teachers. She may do this by a 
series of lectures to the teachers in which she should first 
convince the teachers of the importance of good food hab- 
its for good physical development and health. 
She should explain the nutritive failures which have re- 
sulted when animals have been kept on defective diets. She 
should then interpret to the teachers in language that they 
can understand and use, the facts of nutrition which have 
not yet made their way into the schoolroom literature. She 
will have to elaborate and explain methods of teaching nu- 
trition to children of different ages. Moreover, since the 
subject matter in nutrition may be closely correlated with 
the teaching of geography, arithmetic, language and history, 
the supervisor of nutrition should show the teachers how to 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  
Specialists in the Schools 91 
make these correlations. The supervisor of nutrition must 
be able and willing as the occasion demands to give class- 
room lessons in nutrition, adapting her teaching to the men- 
tal level of each grade. 
In addition she must devote special attention to the 
undernourished children. The food served to the children 
in the open air classes and the mid-morning milk feeding 
for undernourished children in the regular classrooms 
should be under her supervision. In all corrective work 
for undernourished children she will confer with the phy- 
sician, the dentist, the physical trainer and the nurse. It 
is their function to make the physical diagnoses and obtain 
remedial treatment; it is her function to make a critical 
study of the food habits of these undernourished children 
to determine their nutritive deficiencies, and to recommend, 
if necessary, a corrective dietary. She should be a member 
of the health education division of the school faculty, 
with the doctors, the nurses, the oral hygienists and the 
physical trainers. 
The cooperation of the home is necessary in any attempt 
that is made to establish good nutritional conditions in 
children. Home visiting, however, is time-consuming and 
expensive. We do not know to what extent the schools of 
the future will attempt to give instruction in the home; we 
do know that at present the limitations in the school budget 
prohibit the undertaking of that work on a comprehensive 
and adequate scale. Home visiting under our present sys- 
tem will have to be carried on largely by interested agencies 
privately financed. They should provide women trained in 
nutrition and social work. The supervisor of nutrition 
should assign to them those cases showing need of home co- 
operation and home instruction. 
The services of a supervisor of nutrition have not yet 
been standardized in terms of the number of teachers she 
can supervise and the corrective program she can carry on 
for the undernourished children. In New York State we 
have had one supervisor of nutrition in a city of 36,000 
people; we have another supervisor of nutrition in a city 
with a population of 67,000 and next year there will be a 
supervisor of nutrition in a city with a population of 
89,000. There is a woman especially trained in nutrition 
carrying on a general health program in a city of 172,000 How many

people. We shall also have next year a supervisor of nu- 
trition in each of two counties to work with the teachers and 
students in the village and rural schools. We need to have 
programs carried on in such places over a period of years 
in order that the possibilities and the limitations of the 
services of one person may be studied. 
We are convinced that a supervisor of nutrition is ur- 
gently needed in every community. After she has been 
placed on the school staff she should be given opportunity to 
work. She has not been made a part of the school system 
when she has been assigned to a desk in some office. The 
school superintendent should arrange periods when she may 
give lectures to the principals and teachers either during 
the school hours or after school hours or both. He should 
define her place in his school system and explain to her 
the administrative procedure for making contacts with the 
medical director, the nurses, the physical trainers, the oral 
hygienists, the home economics teachers, the lunch room 
managers, and the teachers in the open air classrooms. 
She must be introduced by the superintendent of schools 
to the principals at their first meeting in the school year. 
She must be subsequently introduced to the teachers at their 
first meeting either by the superintendent or by their princi- 
pal. Her position on the school staff and her program 
must be explained to the teachers by the superintendent or 
principal. 
The success of her work will depend largely on her train- 
ing and personality. For well-trained supervisors of nu- 
trition we must turn to the colleges of home economics that 
have strong departments of nutrition. The training re- 
ceived by nurses or physical trainers does not qualify them 
to become supervisors of nutrition. The best colleges of 
home economics are now offering courses in child training 
as well as in child nutrition and are providing opportunity 
to interested students to give classroom lessons in nutrition 
to children of different ages. Courses in psychology are as 
necessary as courses in nutrition and the problems of school 
administration should be carefully studied. In the ability 
of the trained nutritionist to fit herself and her subject into 
the school system and win the interest of the teachers and 
the approval of the parents will lie her success.
-P-A-G-E-101
Specialists in the Schools 93 
What part in the nutrition program may be taken by the 
woman who is conducting a home economics program in 
the public schools? We cannot make a general statement 
in reply; much depends on her training and on the amount 
of energy and spare time she has. Our teachers of home 
economics as far as training is concerned may be divided 
into three classes: 
(1) Those who in their college course specialized in textiles and 
clothing and who had very little training in nutrition. From 
such teachers we can expect but little help in nutrition. 
(2) Those who did study nutrition but whose training took place 
so long ago that their subject matter is obsolete. 
(3) Those whose training in nutrition is thorough and recent. 
If the women in this latter group have the time and 
energy they may contribute service of much value. In 
their own home economics classes they may aim to establish 
good food practices in every girl. They may arouse so 
much interest in good nutrition that the girls will try to 
form good food habits among their brothers and sisters and 
may reform the food practices of their families. In addi- 
tion the teacher of home economics may stage plays featur- 
ing foods and health, at assembly periods and school 
entertainments. If these well-trained teachers of home 
economics have time they may give a series of lectures to the 
teachers emphasizing the importance of good nutrition and 
telling them how to teach the children what their nutritive 
requirements are. The undernourished children may also 
be referred to the teachers of home economics for advice 
about their diet. 
It must be remembered that these activities are in addi- 
tion to her regular duties. They represent volunteer help; 
and volunteer help, because it is somewhat uncertain, is 
not really satisfactory. I do not believe that a home eco- 
nomics teacher can conduct successfully her own program 
and also a satisfactory nutrition program. Home eco- 
nomics teachers who are well trained in nutrition, with time 
for participation in a nutrition program, are a source of 
help not to be overlooked. A home economics teacher able 
and willing to initiate some nutrition work, may convince 
the school authorities of the need for a full-time supervisor 
of nutrition.

  94 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Let us absorb into our school systems those officials who 
are trained in the various phases of health education and 
health service. The supervisor of nutrition is one of these 
persons. Making her a part of the school system is an 
administrative problem that can be solved only by the 
school superintendent. In the ultimate analysis, he needs 
the support of the public in the program he is trying to 
conduct. 
Chairman: 
I am sure that Miss McCormick’s presentation has 
aroused many questions in your minds, as it has in mine. 
However, before we have any discussion, we shall ask Miss 
Daisy Deane Williamson, New Hampshire State Home 
Demonstration Leader, Durham, New Hampshire, to speak 
to us on 
THE RELATION OF THE EXTENSION WORKER TO 
THE GENERAL HEALTH PROGRAM 
Miss Williamson: 
The field of health activities is so broad, the need so 
great, the workers so few, that it has seemed, in spite of all 
we have done, that our accomplishments have been few 
indeed. But, because of our vision, our hopefulness, and 
our extreme interest in raising the standards of health in 
the communities in which we live, we shall continue to labor 
unceasingly for the things that will lengthen our days and 
make us all physically, mentally, and spiritually equal to 
the manifold duties thrust upon us. 
The job is too large for any one person or any one organ- 
ization to do alone. ‘The specially trained worker in any 
phase of health work can, with some success, cope with the 
problems in her line. But it is only with the united help 
of all agencies that a well-rounded-out health program will 
become effective. 
The health educator or nutrition worker, the physical 
director, the teacher, the physician, the nurse, the health 
officer, the extension worker, the individual, each must 
be a contributing factor, losing sight of self and self- 
ish interests, ceasing to insist upon due credit for everything 
done, and always keeping in mind that it is results that are 
wanted. The progress a community makes along health
-P-A-G-E-103
Specialists in the Schools 95 
lines depends upon how soon the health activities cease to 
be put up in small packages. 
In order to keep harmony among workers and create or 
foster a cooperative attitude, the first thing necessary is to 
understand fully what real cooperation is. It is that state 
of mind which will make it possible for other people to work 
with you. With such a state of mind, the real extension 
worker enters the field of health activities, not with the at- 
titude, “What are you going to do to help me?” but rather, 
“What can I do to help you?” In New Hampshire we feel 
that an ideal type of cooperation among health agencies 
has been established. Our little State is pointed out na- 
tionally as outstanding in this line. Nearly four years ago 
a State committee from the various health organizations 
was appointed to bring this about. Each organization was 
asked to outline on paper its special field of activity, and 
its methods of work. The Red Cross, State Board of 
Health, State Board of Education, Tuberculosis Associa- 
tion, State Board of Charities and Corrections, State 
Teachers Association, Cancer Committee of State Medical 
Association, and Extension Service of the University of 
New Hampshire have done this. We have tried religiously 
to recognize professional etiquette. The results of this 
work have been gratifying indeed. 
What is the field of the extension worker in New Hamp- 
shire? I will ask you to keep in mind the fact that the 
Smith-Lever law makes funds available for educational 
purposes with rural people primarily. Extension activities 
center therefore in rural communities. The following re- 
ports of our work with other agencies will explain our co- 
operation: 
(1) Red Cross. We report to the Red Cross any groups of women 
desiring to take a home nursing course. We ask advice in arranging 
for simple instruction as to meeting common emergencies in the home 
before the doctor arrives. This is a great need as in New Hamp- 
shire ninety-two towns have no resident doctor. The Red Cross 
nurses give demonstrations in first aid and home care of the sick 
to our groups. 
(2) State Board of Health. We recognize this agency as head © 
of health work in the State. We report to it infancy and maternity 
cases which come to us for assistance. We work with no children 
under three years as the State Board is prepared to do this phase 
of work. We distribute State Board material on diet for the little Real co- 
operation in 
New Hamp- 
shire
-P-A-G-E-104
  Health ac- 
tivities of

sion worker

child and other printed matter according to the needs of the com- 
munities. The Board’s nurses are available when needed in our 
tural sections; their members come to our State Conferences. 
(3) State Board of Education. This agency helps in furthering 
dental clinic work in the State. We give talks on methods of co- 
operation with the Extension Service to teachers in the normal schools 
and talks on nutrition to State school nurses. 
(4) Tuberculosis Association. We report suspicious cases to the 
tuberculosis nurses and encourage rural groups to assist with the 
Christmas “seal sale.” We offer to supply the association with 
names of possible leaders for the seal sale. Their nurses assist us 
by giving demonstrations in home care of the sick. 
(5) State Board of Charities. We report to them needy cases re- 
ported to us. 
(6) State Federation of Women’s Clubs. ‘The greater part of the 
health work done through the clubs is done by extension workers. 
We send out health programs and supply speakers. 
(7) State Grange. The State leader is adviser to the chairman 
of the health education department of this organization, and health 
material and speakers for grange programs are supplied by our de- 
partment. 
(8) State Nurses’ Association. They assist at conferences. The 
nurses help on home nursing instruction as time will permit. 
(9) Parent-Teacher Association. The State leader is health chair- 
man. This year she made contacts with twenty-four of thirty-three 
affiliated associations, giving information on diet for children. 
(10) Cancer Committee of State Medical Association. The exten- 
sion workers placed printed information on cancer and its control 
in the hands of about five thousand rural women. 
All of these agencies participate with us in the Farmers’ and 
Homemakers’ Conference. We are cooperating with the State Board 
of Health and the State Board of Education in putting on a Nurses’ 
Conference June 30-July 12 at the State University of Durham. 
In rural communities there are other health activities 
which we engage in—activities which are strictly ours. By 
this I mean that no other association does these things and 
we do them at the request of the people. These special ac- 
tivities are as follows: 
(1). Clothing for health 
a. Dress forms. ‘The paper dress forms are made on a foundation 
of gauze vest high at the neck and with short or long sleeves. The 
woman for whom the paper form is to be made, puts on the vest, 
which is about six sizes smaller than she really is, and she is sewed 
into this. Two layers of paper are placed over this gauze vest 
foundation. After it is completed it is taken off and put together, 
making it exactly the size of the woman, who can see at a glance 
her defects and her good points. The women see themselves as
-P-A-G-E-105
  Specialists in the Schools 97 
others see them, and have been able to correct some defects through 
exercises and diet. 
b. Proper corseting. Work with dress forms led to a stressing of 
proper corseting in relation to health. Proper clothing gives a sense 
of self-respect and helps mold the attitude of the rural women 
toward adopting a better type of home-making, proper exercise, and 
proper diet for health. 
c. Color, line and design. In an effort to encourage the beauti- 
fying of homes we have emphasized the importance of color. Color 
schemes in rooms have everything to do with our attitude toward 
our jobs, and we try to get into the home the proper arrangements 
of colors and little things that will beautify it. It makes a woman 
more contented. 
(2) Food and health 
a. Food selection. (Water, milk, butter, bread, vegetables, toma- 
toes, greens, fruit.) Along the line of foods we take up the sub- 
ject of food selection, and under it we deal primarily with health 
tules. We consider especially those referring to the amount of water 
needed each day, the amount of milk needed, the addition of whole- 
some butter, fresh vegetables—especially tomatoes and greens—and 
fruit to the diet. All our work along food selection lines is based 
on these health rules. 
b. School lunches. We help with the school lunches, working, 
however, only at the request of the school authorities. No exten- 
sion worker will go into the schools of the State unless invited to 
do so, recognizing that this is the province of the school authorities. 
c. Portable dental clinics for rural communities. 
d. Invalid cookery. We are doing a little along the line of in- 
valid cooking. 
e. Emergencies. We have also done some work along the line of 
home emergencies before the doctor arrives, because there are not 
enough nurses in our State to give this instruction themselves or give 
home demonstrations. 
(3) Home improvement 
a. More convenient homes. Proper equipment (stressing kitchen 
equipment) and proper arrangement of same. Stenciling of oil- 
cloth with a view of saving laundering. 
b. More beautiful homes. Renovation of furniture (refinishing 
of old furniture and caning of chairs). Practical interior decoration. 
Handicraft (rug-making, basketry, lamp-shades). 
We are emphasizing the importance of proper equipment with 
the idea of getting people interested in the things which will con- 
serve time and energy and give a chance for the recreation which 
they should have, all of which go to make up one of the foundations 
of good health work. We have been working over those killing 
New England kitchens, getting the women to rearrange them. If 
they can’t partition them off, they can at least rearrange the equip- 
ment so as to save a few miles a day.
-P-A-G-E-106

nity health

  98 - Cambridge Health Education Conference 
(4) Community development 
Sanitary buildings. We have also concerned ourselves with the 
matter of community development. Communities have worked on 
some projects such as sanitary conditions in schools and in public 
buildings of all sorts, and also on the matter of collecting garbage 
and cleaning up the various places needing it. We ask the com- 
munities to work as communities, not as individuals. 
Every extension worker to do successfully her health 
work must be a living example of what she preaches— 
must have excellent health, be neither decidedly over nor 
under weight, must be cheerful, have no chronic ailments 
and above all must see the health work in the community as 
a whole. If you need this worker, just tell her so. She 
will be ready to help. 
Ask yourselves if you are real cooperators, if you have 
the real vision of health work, if you are helping communi- 
ties to cease keeping their health activities tied up in small 
packages. If you aren’t, may I ask, “Why aren’t you?” 
Chairman: 
Miss Williamson has pointed out to us a source upon 
which we can draw in helping rural teachers who are with- 
out the facilities that many of the larger communities have. 
The extension workers have such facilities in their control 
or they put us in touch with others who have them. 
There is another group of specialists whose work has 
direct relation to the health of children—the work of those 
specially trained in physical education. We have with us 
Miss Edith Sears, Instructor of Physical Education and 
Hygiene at the Girls’ High School, Boston, Massachusetts, 
and Miss Bessie L. Barnes, Director of Physical Education 
in the Public Schools of Brookline, Massachusetts. Will 
they not say a word in regard to 
THE PROVINCE OF THE PHysiIcAL EDUCATOR 
IN THE HEALTH PROGRAM 
Miss Sears: 
Many of us in the field of physical education realize 
that physical education, so called, is only one branch of 
the great field of health education, dealing with the ac-
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Specialists in the Schools 99 
tivities side. There is great need, if we are to go on suc- 
cessfully, for closer correlation with the other branches. 
The arrangement of the activities program should depend 
upon the pupils themselves, their conditions of growth, fa- 
tigue, leisure, state of mind, etc. Activities should be mod- 
ified, and in some cases suspended altogether and rest pe- 
riods introduced, when we are dealing with cases of mal- 
nutrition. 
Instruction in health habits, nutrition, and mental hy- 
giene should go hand in hand with instruction in physical 
education. 
Miss Barnes: 
Physical education has, I think, been slow in recogniz- 
ing its own position. Its widest appeal is to the people 
who need it most. Talk as we will about nutrition, it does 
not appeal to the person who wants to grow thin, nor to 
the average high school girl. In physical education we 
have a controlling hand with which we can really guide a 
person’s health habits through the innate desire for play and 
recreation. In exceptional cases that appeal does not func- 
tion; but it is likely to function if we as physical educators 
only feel that a large part of our duties is to implant health 
habits, not only of action, but of rest and nutrition, and 
to make girls and boys feel that the things they love most to 
do, during the period of growth, are the very things of 
which their bodies have the greatest need. 
Spending all the time and money available for physical 
education on the high school rather than on the elementary 
school, is comparatively a waste of time, because in the 
high school, children are not in the same condition to re- 
ceive as they were earlier in life. In the high school, our 
work should be embellishing what has previously been 
done, rather than making a beginning. 
Medical examinations in the Brookline High School 
were established as a medical background for the work in 
physical education. They were started many years ago 
through a skillful woman, Dr. Sarah A. Bond, who was em- 
ployed to take account of stock of the girls who came to the

being obtained with too great freedom. This medical work Girls’ high

helped in a practical way. We met with almost no oppo- 
sition, because of the personality of the examiner 
and because of the value of the examination that was 
given. 
About ten years ago we started posture work in the 
schools. We had a specially trained teacher and to her we 
took the children who had the most glaring defects. Out 
of a school system of 4,000 children, 1,000 came to us once 
a week. Mothers came and learned what should be done. 
The children went back into their classes, after a few 
months, without standing out as seriously defective. That 
work went on until the school board felt that we were work- 
ing too much with a small proportion of children. In 
physical education, as in other departments, the most ex- 
pensive children are those who are slowest to comprehend 
class work and need individual instruction. The child 
after this individual work was ready to receive training in 
the large group. 
We do not now do special posture work, as such, but we 
emphasize preventive work. Our plan in the elementary 
schools is activity, purposeful and efficient. In grades one 
to six inclusive, we have only fifteen minutes a day and 
one period a week in the gymnasium. During the out- 
of-door season, as far as possible, all work is done out 
of doors. Our main purpose is to give the children the 
things they will like so much that they will do them outside 
of school hours, thus increasing the time of activity, and 
fostering in children a liking for the right sort of activity. 
You do not find the children doing “hips firm” for the fun 
of it. That has its place possibly in the formal two-minute 
drill of the schoolroom. The real work of the educator is 
to furnish opportunity, the children will do the rest. 
We use large muscle activities such as climbing, running, 
hopping, handsprings, cart wheels, etc. This plan has pre- 
vented many posture defects to such a degree that if we were 
to take out all this larger activity and put back the definite 
posture work it would be a great loss to us. Children find 
the greatest pleasure in inventing things, and are quick to 
discover those exercises which lead to greatest development. 
Children are constantly on the alert for opportunity to prac- 
tice things we wish we had time for in the class period.
-P-A-G-E-109
Specialists in the Schools 101 
In all the schools, not only in the high school, every time 
we have an athletic competition, the chief medical inspector 
definitely states who may go into that competition. An en- 
trant must have the sanction (1) of the doctor, (2) of the 
school principal, as to whether he is a fit subject to represent 
the school, and (3) of the physical education department, 
as to whether his skill is wanted in that particular place. 
The medical department says who; the physical education 
department says what. 
In the high school, each girl has been classified according 
to her physical condition and given a grade A, B, C, or 
D. If there is nothing the matter with her she is given an 
A. All the “A” girls are allowed to take complete athletics 
and are classified as “C. A.” 
If she has a remediable defect, or is strikingly below 
weight, we allow her to do regular general gymnasium 
work, under supervision, and limit her athletics. A girl 
in that condition should not play a full game of basket- 
ball no matter how much she wants to. We put her in 
another grade, complete with limited athletics, classified 
aan (CLA? 
The next grade includes those who should have some 
corrective or recreational work in the gymnasium. A girl 
in this class has partial gymnasium work and limited ath- 
letics and is classified as “P. L. A.” 
The next grade is called the minimum, and includes 
those pupils who should be relieved of the pressure of the 
daily school program. Most of these girls go to the gym- 
nasium and participate, under the supervision of the 
teacher, in as many things as they are fitted todo. From 
those who do not go to the gymnasium (except for a few 
really medical cases), we demand two periods a week for 
health, to be spent in resting, sitting out of doors, or in any 
other way that contributes to the health of the individual. 
Thus we keep our fingers on every girl who needs special at- 
tention. 
Those people get just as much credit for their work as 
though they did every stunt in the gymnasium. A girl do- 
ing orthopedic work out of school hours, under a physician’s 
care, is excused from regular gymnasium work, in order 
that her time may be conserved and a report from the physi- ‘Athletics

cian is credited to her work in the department of physical 
education as though taken there, and it counts for gradu- 
ation. ‘This reacts upon the girl herself. 
By request, special conferences with the chief medical 
inspector, or with the instructor in physical education, are 
held after notices have been sent to parents. Valuable 
follow-up work has been done by telephone. This work 
with the parents is of great value, especially the parent- 
teacher meetings, where the mother is invited to see her 
girl’s health card and talk over the situation. 
I know that people have felt at times as though the whole 
scheme of education were designed not to build up but to 
destroy; that the girl who can live through the pressure of 
a high school course, and go to college in abundant health, 
will find at college something that is quite worth while, for 
she will be in condition to find it. The delicate girl should 
take longer time for the high school course so that she may 
be fitted to enjoy the next stage of her development, whether 
in college or not. 
Should not we have our whole school program so ar- 
ranged that the pupils will not need a vacation for rest from 
the educational process? If our educational program could 
be so planned that the child would take no backward steps 
from the kindergarten to the college, then we might rejoice 
in a health program that is comprehensive. 
Miss McCormick suggested that Miss Effie Knowlton, 
Director Health Education, Binghamton Public Schools, 
Binghamton, New York, could add something to the dis- 
cussion by telling the conference 
How THE Work oF SPECIALISTS Is CORRELATED 
Miss Knowlton: 
The position of the director of health education in our 
city is purely an administrative position. All of the spe- 
cialists of the health education staff are combined in the one 
organization. We have our school physicians, including 
an orthopedic and an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist, 
our school dentists, our health teachers (all these being 
registered nurses), oral hygienists, a hygiene and nutrition 
specialist, physical specialists in the elementary schools,
-P-A-G-E-111
Specialists in the Schools 108 
physical instructors in the high school, a secretary and the 
director. That at present is our organization. As a new 
field is developed, the specialist who is to work in that par- 
ticular field becomes a member of the health education 
staff. My opinion with reference to the nutrition worker is 
that she should be a member of the health education staff. 
In Binghamton four years ago we introduced our nutrition 
work into the schools, and the nutrition worker became a 
member of the health education staff, even though at that 
time she was financed by our local chapter of the Red 
Cross. For more than a year her salary was paid by them 
and then the department took that work over. During the 
whole period, however, the nutrition specialist worked from 
the health education office. 
This central office is the clearing house for all problems 
of health service and health instruction which arise in the 
schools, where all administrative measures are discussed 
with the various specialists, where daily reports from all 
field workers are reviewed by the director, and where all 
necessary records of the work of the department are filed. 
This office serves as headquarters for all health specialists. 
Miss Brown: 
Has Binghamton a purely administrative head and a 
large corps of specialists? It is very difficult to keep spe- 
cialists from overlapping in their work and also it is diffi- 
cult to keep work from falling in between the specialists. 
That is one of the most important problems, in reference 
to specialists, from the administrator’s point of view. 
Miss Knowlton: 
We work as one group. ‘The director has frequent con- 
ferences with the different departments—conferences with 
nurses, with physicians, with the whole medical and dental 
staff, and with the physical education staff. At other 
times the director meets in conference the entire health edu- 
cation staff. At such times problems from the different 
fields are presented and discussed for the enlightenment 
of all. One requirement in our health education depart- 
ment is that every specialist on our staff shall know some- 
thing of the aims and the accomplishments of every other 
specialist in the group.’  
-P-A-G-E-112
  The admin- 
istrative 
director 
  104 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
There was a period of more than a year, when there was 
no director coordinating the work of the various health 
specialists in our city schools. Our former director had 
been granted a leave of absence to organize a health edu- 
cation department in one of our State normal schools. 
During that time it was demonstrated that without careful 
coordination of the different lines of work, there are apt to 
be overlappings in some places and gaps in others. That 
is why we have felt that the unified program under one head 
is the most economical and effective method of working. 
Our general program is outlined and administered by the 
director of health education, always with the idea in mind 
that the specialist, with his specialized training, should be 
the recognized authority in our system concerning all tech- 
nical matters in his own field. The administrative director 
has had school experience and is thoroughly acquainted 
with the schools of our city and their administration. This 
experience enables her to know how the health program can 
best be fitted into the general school program. While the 
specialists work very directly with the teachers and the chil- 
dren, the director works with these groups chiefly through 
the administrative head of the school, the principal. It is 
her business to keep the principal informed concerning all 
health work to be carried on in his school and to see that the 
principal’s cooperation with each specialist is assured; to 
see that necessary program adjustments are made and to 
avoid conflicts with the work of other directors of instruc- 
tion. 
Whether the specialist be a physician, a physical in- 
structor, or a nutrition supervisor—whatever his work may 
be—the director of health education tries not to intrude 
upon his particular field; her purpose rather is to bring 
about those conditions which shall make it possible for him 
to do his work most effectively. 
Miss Towne: 
What is the expense of the health staff in the school 
budget, and what is the school population? 
Miss Knowlton: 
I don’t know that I can tell exactly for this year. In 
1922, with a school population of approximately 13,000
-P-A-G-E-113
  
Specialists in the Schools 105 
children including the parochial schools where we give the 
same medical and dental service as in the public schools, 
the amount set aside in our school budget for health edu- 
cation was $35,000. The State in quotas and other forms 
of subsidy reduced this amount by more than $9,000, leav- 
ing approximately $26,000 to be raised by taxation. We 
figured then that the cost to the taxpayers for the services of 
all members of the school health staff was two dollars per 
year per child. This meant one cent per day per child for 
medical and dental service, supervision of a complete phys- 
ical education program, and supervision of instruction in 
hygiene and nutrition. 
Dr. Burdick: 
Some one has asked whether physical education is organ- 
ized to include medical inspection as well as health educa- 
tion. In Baltimore, under the direction of Dr. Walter F. 
Cobb, this arrangement exists. Physical education is con- 
ceived as including the art of physical training, with its 
varied activities, and examinations are made to find out the 
possibilities of each child in accordance with his physical] 
and mental well-being and his endowed capacity. It makes 
physical examinations of the child also with the view of 
finding out the defects coming from environment. 
The physical training is informal, with practically no- 
thing of the formal or direct type of training. It includes 
work within the schools and work between different schools. 
There is a nutrition worker who gives her whole time to the 
physical education and the home economics departments. 
The care of handicapped children is all handled through 
the department of physical education. This includes 
children with speech or hearing difficulties, cripples, the 
feeble-minded, and children presenting behavior problems. 
This department also deals with matters of health educa- 
tion and instruction. $125,000 to $140,000 is spent an- 
nually for this work in the schools of Baltimore. 
The Chairman then announced a request that Mrs. Ora 
Hart Avery, the State Supervisor of Home Economics, 
State Board of Education, Richmond, Virginia, tell about 
the effort to assist teachers in working out a home eco- 
nomics program. The cost of

HEALTH AnD Home Economics 
Cottage Plan: Virginia Rural Schools 
Mrs. Avery: 
You have to understand rural Virginia before I can say 
anything that would make you understand the situation, 
because rural Virginia is remote from anything that has 
been thus far presented. I do not wish to be speaking in a 
foreign language. Our minimum requirement is fifty pu- 
pils in the high school. We speak in tens and hundreds, 
while you speak in thousands and tens of thousands. 
I think our home economics has fallen down a little bit 
on health. We have made very pleasant conversation 
about health but we seem to have accomplished very few re- 
sults as far as health is concerned. I feel quite sure that 
if home economics had done its duty there would be no 
American Child Health Association. 
My schools are limited to the schools that are state-aided 
or those aided by the Smith-Hughes provision. We have 
cottages in five rural sections. The cottage represents the 
home that the income of the community could afford. Our 
food work is based on the income of the community, and 
our clothing work is also based on the income that these 
girls will have when they are married, which is anywhere 
from $1,000 to $1,800. We do not go over $1,800 for our 
budget. 
The home economics teacher takes the inspection cards 
that the home-room teacher has made out, to find out how 
many children are underweight, and she is the specialist to 
take care of those cards and bring those children up to 
weight. She is well trained enough to consult with the 
physician if necessary to find out if there is any organic 
trouble. The next thing in her program is to assist with 
the hot lunches. There is one hot dish, preferably a hot 
drink, to be served in the drinking cup. In some schools 
every child gets one hot drink, free of charge, prepared by 
the senior girls under the teachers. The children 
are taught to wash their hands before they eat, and to 
have a clean paper napkin of some description for their 
lunches.
-P-A-G-E-115
  Specialists in the Schools 107 
The next point to speak of is first aid. We give first- 
aid work to any baseball fingers or cuts or scratches or any- 
thing that can be done. We also do first-aid work on 
clothing, such as sewing on buttons, mending tears and so 
on. We have in our cottages a bedroom for rest for the 
teachers or any child who needs it at any time. 
The aim of home economics in Virginia is to promote 
and protect health and to produce citizens who will raise the 
standard of American living. 
Chairman: 
This is an interesting way of attacking the home eco- 
nomics-health education combination. 
T have a request that Miss Anna L. De Planter, in charge 
of Nutrition Education and Demonstration, Philadelphia 
Child Health Society, describe the work of that group. 
SUPERVISION AND STIMULATION OF NUTRITION WorK 
IN Pusiic SCHOOLS BY OUTSIDE AGENCIES 
Miss De Planter: 
The work of our organization is city-wide and touches 
closely or remotely fundamental problems in child health 
with special emphasis on the importance of prenatal care, 
nutrition, and mouth hygiene. Our cooperation with the 
public schools is therefore but a small part of our work. 
However, as this section is one on school administration, 
remarks will be confined to our direct connection with the 
public schools. : 
The first nutrition work of our organization was a part 
of a special health demonstration in a restricted area of the 
city. It consisted of the usual routine of weekly weighing, 
class instruction and home visiting for groups of public 
school children who had been examined at our clinic and 
found to be 10% or more underweight. Some of these 
classes were held in schools and some at our health center. 
This type of nutrition education was continued for two 
years. By the end of that time enough nutrition class 
demonstrations had been conducted by various private or- 
ganizations to create a desire on the part of the public 
school officials to have this work become an integral part of 
the school system. Nutrition

  108 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
With this desire for increased nutrition work in the 
schools the most constructive contribution our organization 
could make to the situation was to provide definite instruc- 
tion in nutrition for teachers and school nurses, as had 
previously been done for groups of health workers in other 
city departments. 
A practical course in nutrition emphasizing its specific 
relation to problems of school administration, general 
health education and correction of malnutrition was given 
to all the school nurses. This group met regularly on Sat- 
urday morning from October until July. Ample time was 
thus provided for giving various aspects of the work with 
its practical problems and applications to school work. 
Demonstration nutrition classes were conducted in various 
schools to serve as observation centers. 
The following year a supervisor of nutrition was ap- 
pointed whose work was to organize and direct the nutrition 
program in the public schools. Since its inception this 
program has been carried on by the specific work of the 
school physicians and nurses and the general cooperation 
of both principals and teachers. The classroom teacher 
can most easily and successfully provide the general health 
education. The special nutrition class work with under- 
nourished children is for the present being carried on by 
the school nurse under the immediate direction of the nutri- 
tion supervisor. To insure adequate help for each nurse 
in establishing this work, various private organizations 
have continued to cooperate with the public schools by 
contributing the services of their nutrition specialists. 
Chairman: 
I will now ask Miss Mabel C. Bragg, Assistant Super- 
intendent of Schools, Newton, Massachusetts, to tell us, 
from her experience 
How ErrectivE HEALTH EpucaTION CAN BE SECURED 
WITHOUT A SPECIAL HEALTH SUPERVISOR 
Miss Bragg: 
How can a superintendent secure effective health educa- 
tion in his schools without a special supervisor? This 
subject is a most encouraging one because it suggests at the
-P-A-G-E-117
Specialists in the Schools 109 
outset that you have the superintendent ready to take up 
this work. 
The question of health education in the public schools 
is a most important one for superintendents, and we must 
secure the interest of the superintendent first of all. There 
are so many of us who believe in this work. There 
are so many of us who are trying to do something for the 
health of the children throughout this country. I represent 
a school system where I am an assistant superintendent of 
schools. We have a fine superintendent. We have a 
splendid board of education. And we have splendid 
teachers and children. How can we put over a health 
education program in a system of public schools with the 
system functioning as it normally does, without making the 
superintendent and teachers think that a health education 
program is another extra thing for the School Department 
to carry? How can we promote a health education pro- 
gram today when everybody along the line, from the alder- 
men down, is talking about economy, and new kinds of 
supervisors cannot be provided? 
Suppose we have our superintendent interested. If he 
is, three-quarters of the work is over, for after all it’s the 
school superintendent who determines the educational 
policies of the school. It’s the school superintendent who 
determines what shall be in the curriculum of his school. 
It is true that outside agencies such as Chambers of Com- 
merce and the Women’s Clubs can say to the School Depart- 
ment, “We want this new kind of work done.” The School 
Department sometimes has to bar the doors of the schools 
lest too many outside, uncomfortable things be intruded 
into the school curriculum. But your superintendent will 
listen: he must give what the public wants, if the public is 
able to interpret its wants into terms that will fit into the 
school system. 
Ideal conditions are beautiful things for us to consider. 
We all wish we could have specialists come to help us out 
wherever we need them. But suppose we cannot have new 
specialists on our staff, how can we use our staff as it exists 
to put across a health education program? How can we 
get our superintendents, the very finest of them, to act 
with us? 
This is the most wonderful time in the world for health Who deter- 
mines the 
school pro- 
gram and 
policies?
-P-A-G-E-118
Using what 
we have 
  110 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
education to be coming into its own; because this is the time 
when the curriculum in the public schools is being made 
over. It is being made over to meet the needs of the in- 
dividual child, and health education is a matter of in- 
dividual children. The needs—mental, spiritual, physical 
—of individual children must be met. We want to be able 
to go to any teacher and say, “You know what this child’s 
defects are and what his accomplishments are. What have 
you to say concerning the health of this child?” We shall 
have to know that in order to judge whether or not that 
child is accomplishing all that he ought to accomplish with 
a certain given power. Teachers want to know nowadays 
about the physical condition of their children, because this 
is the time of meeting individual needs. So it is the best 
possible time to put over a health education program. How 
are we going to do it? 
We have to get the board of education, and we have to get 
the superintendent of schools, to see that this is true and be 
ready to put their conviction into effect. We have splendid 
superintendents and principals who care for the individual 
needs of their children; and we have classroom teachers 
who are able to do this. These we have to begin with 
and then we have the children! 
One would wonder sometimes when we are discussing 
theories whether we were really working with children. 
Then we have the parents. Occasionally we have to work 
with them. Their cooperation in teaching health is in- 
valuable. The whole field of public school work has 
changed its emphasis. We are’nt simply teaching in- 
formation in these days; we’re teaching attitudes and 
practices. And one of our greatest triumphs is the achieve- 
ment of higher standards of health by the children 
themselves. 
It was interesting last February in Chicago to hear the 
men who spoke on the general platform of the National 
Superintendents Meetings say that we must teach health in 
the public schools. They all said it should be done; they 
all believed it should be done, because all the great 
educators are talking about it, and writing about it. The 
people, however, who are really working it out are the class- 
room teachers in the public schools, and such other people 
as are working most closely with them.
-P-A-G-E-119
Specialists in the Schools 111 
If a superintendent of schools wants health education in 
his system of schools, how shall we use the organization 
that is at hand? How shall we use our doctors and nurses, 
whether they are under the direction of the board of educa- 
tion or the board of health? How shall we use our prin- 
cipals if we can have no supervisor of health education? 
We must all work together for the best health of our chil- 
dren. It seems to me that we have overlooked very 
seriously the importance of the school principals in our plan 
of health education, for what goes on in the school is just 
about what the principal believes should be done. Prin- 
cipals are very important people! If the principal wants 
this health education program put over, and makes known 
his desire to the superintendent, it is almost certain that 
health education will be taught. 
We must bring into cooperation all the forces that are 
at work. The parents must understand what we are trying 
to do. The physical training teacher must put the health 
emphasis on her work and show that she is interested in 
the growth and health of the children, and in supplying 
new kinds of activity which will tend toward health. The 
school doctors and school nurses must work not only against 
contagious diseases and decayed teeth, but for im- 
proved physical condition generally. Our science teachers 
in the upper grades must teach a part of their general 
science for the sake of improving the living conditions and 
health of their pupils. They should give not only knowl- 
edge to use; they should also seek to change pupils’ at- 
titudes. Our cooking teachers and our home economics 
teachers must teach the children in the upper grades and 
in the high school the right kind of food habits and the 
right kind of clothing habits. 
In other words our teachers must teach their own subjects 
from the viewpoint of the health of the children. Red 
Cross nurses can be secured to give advice and to give 
special courses in home and personal hygiene for boys and 
girls. 
Here are all these people at work, yet suppose we can’t 
get it all done? ‘Teachers ask, “How are we going to get 
the time?” What is time for? How can we use it better 
than to use it for the physical hygiene, the mental hygiene, 
and the spiritual hygiene of our boys and girls? After all, Cooperation 
of all forces
-P-A-G-E-120

112 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
we are working for better health, not as an end in itself, 
but in order to achieve greater mental and spiritual results. 
Now we will suppose that the principal is willing, and is 
expected to put over a health education program. Where 
does he get it? Well, where does he get all his other 
programs? Who determines the policy of the school and 
the subjects to be taught? The board of education and the 
superintendent of schools. And our nutrition workers, our 
home economics teachers, our physical training teachers 
can be called upon to teach our teachers the things we want 
our children to get out of the health program. Our State 
Board of Health, the Tuberculosis League, and the Na- 
tional Dairy and Food Council provide us with much ex- 
cellent material. 
Teachers are taking extension courses all over the country 
in mental hygiene and health work, in order to have health 
material to give to their children and improve their own 
health conditions. When boards of education and su- 
perintendents have passed on to their principals and their 
teachers the idea that health education is to be the founda- 
tion of the curriculum in any system of schools, then health 
education will be taught in those schools. 
We are probably not yet using sufficiently all the agencies 
that are at hand. We all want to do things very differently; 
but we must first take school! systems as they are, and see 
what we can do with them as they exist. If your principals 
care, and your teachers care, and your parents care, and 
if your doctors and nurses care, and the physical training 
people care, then all the children will care, and nothing will 
stop this movement. These people who care enough will 
not have to wait for specialists. 
RurAL SCHOOL PROBLEMS 
Miss Vance: 
Out of our 100 counties in Virginia sixty-five are strictly 
rural with none of the already mentioned specialists in 
them. My work for the last four years has been in the 
counties where there have been no county public health 
nurses. Miss Bragg in her talk made me feel confident 
that we are accomplishing a health program in some of 
these counties. Virginia has been criticised for trying to Virginia 
 
-P-A-G-E-121

train teachers in the teacher training schools to make the 
physical inspection, but we are beginning to see good 
results. 
I would like to give you two pictures; first a bad picture 
of one of our rural counties in which the only agencies are 
the school superintendent and the teachers. Before going 
into this county I was determined to sell the superintend- 
ent a health program for the schools, but was disappointed 
to find that he was not only county superintendent of schools 
but a practicing physician, and he was running three farms 
and a country store. You can guess how much time he 
could give to new interests in his schools. This county 
had about fifty schools, approximately 1800 children en- 
rolled. The one high school had an attendance of less 
than 200 pupils. This is just a picture of what we may 
find. 
The other picture is of a county where a young agricul- 
tural teacher is superintendent. In one district of this 
county there is a rural supervisor. The superintendent 
visited the public health nurse in the adjoining county in 
the interest of a health program for his county, and she re- 
ferred him to the State board of health. He wrote us: 
“T want to teach health in my county and want to know 
something about it.” I was sent over to sell him a health 
program. From other experiences in these rural counties 
I knew the two outstanding things that were needed in the 
schools—sanitary toilets and correction of dental defects. 
I decided those would be the two points to emphasize in 
order to convince him. ‘The dental condition would have 
to be discovered by inspection. Virginia’s law requiring 
teachers to know something about making a physical in- 
spection of children annually, and to know something about 
teaching health habits, covers five points: Weighing and 
measuring (and finding out the underweights), vision, 
hearing, posture and teeth. When teachers can see that the 
health education program is a part of the whole child, and 
that the physical condition often affects the mental condi- 
tion, they are much more in sympathy with the program. 
The first thing that we did in this county was to check 
the teachers’ inspections, and help them with any they did 
not understand. At the same time we wanted to teach the 
superintendent how to make these simple inspections. I When the 
superin- 
tendent is

had planned to stay for a week; at the end of four days he 
said, “I think I can do it from now on and will try to see 
that every child in the county has a physical inspection.” 
We inspected the toilets. Some schools had none, some 
had one, some had toilets which were not fit to use. Be- 
cause of the large numbers of children found with defective 
teeth the teachers were interested in planning for a dental 
clinic. Following are the results of a three-year program 
in the county: 
First year: One hundred per cent physical inspection made by 
teachers. Interest was started for a white dental clinic. Inspec- 
tion of toilets made and report made to school board. 
Second Year: One hundred per cent physical inspection made 
by teachers. White dental clinic put on, to reach every school in 
county. Every school provided with two sanitary toilets (by help 
of school board). Interest started for a colored dental clinic. 
Third Year: One hundred per cent physical inspection made by 
teachers. A colored dental clinic put on to reach every colored 
school in county. A toxin-antitoxin clinic that reached seven schools 
(350 children took the toxin-antitoxin). A one-week pre-school- 
age white dental clinic held (well attended). 
Aside from the program mentioned, several children with diseased 
tonsils had attention. Several orthopedic cases were treated and 
several of the defective eye cases. 
Chairman: 
Miss Rhea K. Boardman, Visiting Teacher at Red Bank, 
New Jersey, can, I am sure, contribute to the discussion of 
rural problems. She will speak on 
Tue TEACHER’s JoB OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM 
Miss Boardman: 
It will be many years before we have special classes and 
specialists in rural communities; but we always have school 
teachers. They must be trained to carry the message of 
good health and right living. Common sense and friendli- 
ness will be their best assets. The young teacher with a 
scientific point of view will probably be much surprised and 
disappointed to learn that her “new-fangled notions” are 
not wanted in rural districts. 
In Monmouth County, New Jersey, we have the famous 
Piney group. One would imagine that in such an outly- 
ing district visitors would be welcome. Not so. I worked
-P-A-G-E-123
  
Rural Problems 115 
for an entire month before I was at all welcome in their 
homes. I tried various devices and simply “sold myself.” 
Teachers could with profit learn the technique used by 
salesmen of aluminum ware. A salesman tries to make a 
good impression upon the woman of the house; the more 
agreeable the conversation, the more chance for a sale. 
Mothers are disturbed by a teacher’s visit and their first 
thought is: “I wonder what Johnny has done today!” 
The cooperation of the mother is of vital importance and a 
teacher should aim to interest her in her children’s mental 
and physical condition. Several visits may be needed be- 
fore results are realized. 
In a district where social, moral, and physical conditions 
were poor, I was anxious to begin my home visiting. -The 
people were unwilling for a stranger to intrude. I con- 
ceived the idea of having drawing lessons in school. We 
made pumpkin faces and jack o’ lanterns for Hallowe’en. 
The children took them home. I suggested that if they 
placed them in their windows, when I drove past I would 
know that one of my friends lived there and perhaps would 
visit them. Within a short time I was welcomed in all 
their homes. 
One mother had tuberculosis. The family slept with 
windows closed and several people in each room. Their 
only stove was in the kitchen. If they opened the windows, 
the snow would drift in and not thaw till spring. Health 
work in destitute homes requires long and patient effort on 
the part of teacher or nurse. If we lived a quarter of a 
mile from a spring or well, and every bit of water had to be 
brought that distance, would we take our daily baths? 
What can we expect of the mother of a large family? 
A teacher should realize that she may have before her 
each morning some of the insane, murderers, criminals, 
professors, financiers, bankers, and possibly the president, 
of the next generation. She should realize also that every 
mother, with very few exceptions, is vitally interested in 
her children. It is worth the effort it takes to make a home 
call just to see the happy expression on a mother’s face 
when her child is praised. And if the child has done 
wrong, it is better to make a friendly call first before the 
bad report is made. The teacher who can gain the mother’s 
confidence, and help her with her difficult problems, is do- Work of the

examined 116 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
ing work for the future. She should recognize not only 
faulty progress in the “three R’s,” but also ‘“‘danger signals” 
in personalities. We all believe that failures in adult life 
can be traced to childhood. Every teacher therefore should 
feel her responsibility. Her work cannot be over at three- 
thirty or four if she is actively working with the parents. 
Why, rather than what, should be the question most 
pertinent in the teacher’s mind. If a child has misbehaved, 
it is not what he did that is important, but why he did it. 
It is not how well a teacher teaches, but how well she trains 
herself to be an intelligent friend of every child, that counts. 
Mr. Herman Pinkerton, Superintendent of Schools, 
Smithville, Tennessee, also testified that in rural health 
work it is very important to secure home cooperation. Few 
parents visit the schools. Teachers, by visiting homes and 
talking about school health work, can accomplish a good 
deal. In his particular rural school the point system had 
proved to be a valuable means of arousing the children’s 
enthusiasm. 
Miss Rood mentioned that it is essential in rural work, 
as elsewhere, to secure the enthusiasm of the children if a 
program of school health is to be successful. In a cam- 
paign for school examinations “to find out how many 
strong and healthy children there were in the school,” they 
gave a child one gold star for getting the parent’s consent 
to the examination, and a second star after the examination 
had taken place. There was intense rivalry between two 
schools. The parents wished their children to secure the 
stars, and belong to the “select group” of those who had 
been examined. A record of 100% examined was the 
result. 
Miss Mary E. Williams, Public Health Nurse in charge 
of a Healih Center at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, 
Alabama, made a plea for health education for the negroes 
in rural districts of the South. 
Miss Williams: 
I have been trying to make people see how important it 
is that the rural colored people should be educated and
-P-A-G-E-125
Rural Problems 117 
trained in healthy living. Some people told me that this 
is not needed until children come to the high school. You 
would be surprised if you really could see the need for 
health education in the rural districts of the South. Booker 
T. Washington was interested in the rural districts. I 
asked a friend of mine to travel through the State of 
Alabama to get in touch with the rural people. After seven 
months’ investigations, conditions were reported as very 
sad. The people of my race need health education. We 
are dying by the thousands. If ever you know of any as- 
sociation that wants to help the colored race, ask them to 
employ someone to go among the colored people and give 
them health education! 
At Tuskegee I teach children simple elementary hygiene, 
social hygiene, and sex education. These children have 
met me and said, ‘‘We wish we could have hygiene every 
day!” They have it once a week in the first and second 
years. Miss Dolfinger’s visit was a great help to me. 
Since then I have been successful in winning one of the 
American Child Health Association’s scholarships and I 
am to matriculate at Simmons College this summer. I wish 
that the colored people of the South could have the op- 
portunity to have a health education conference. 
I wish you would come to Tuskegee and see conditions 
for yourself. And if you want to help us, please give us 
your cooperation in the matter of health education so that 
we can have better boys, better girls and better communities 
in the future. 
The Chairman asked Mrs. Hobson to report the outcome 
of a round table, of which she was chairman. Mrs. Hob- 
son said that her group had defined the aim of the health 
program in high schools as that of “achieving vitality plus” 
for high school students. The report of this meeting, in- 
cluding a recommendation for a study to be made of fatigue 
among high school students, presented at a later meeting 
of the conference, is given on page 235. 
There being no further contributions, the meeting was

118 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
JomnT SESSION FoR FurTHER Discussion 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
Miss Dolfinger, at the request of the Chairman, gave the 
following summary of the morning discussion of the rela- 
tion of specialists to the school health program. 
Miss Dolfinger: 
When we gathered to prepare this report we set ourselves 
the task, not of summarizing the proceedings, but of in- 
terpreting them to you. We agreed that a specialist is a 
person who has had specialized, technical training, by 
means of which that person can be of use to the rest of the 
staff. Out of our discussion in regard to the function of 
such specialists in relation to the program, the following 
three lines of activity seemed to us to outline the function 
of this ‘specially trained person” in relation to the rest of 
the staff: 
First, to improve the work of the classroom teacher by supplying 
sound information; 
Second, to supervise instruction when this specially trained person 
has had the adequate teaching experience and training to fit him for 
such supervisory work; 
Third, to supply fresh material and inspiration to the classroom 
teacher. 
The meeting this morning was not long enough to include 
discussion of the many kinds of specialists that are coming 
into the school program. ‘This program is not wide enough 
to take in everything that might be included in a complete 
and logical set-up for a health program. There was no 
discussion of the place of the specially trained psychologist 
in the field of health education because no one presented 
that topic for discussion. Not many states nor cities in 
this country have, as yet, a psychologist on the school staff. 
You who are here represent about one-tenth of one per 
cent of the educational staffs of the entire country. Many 
things that seem to you necessities would seem like absolute 
extravagances to many boards of education. The things 
we are discussing here are the every-day commonplace 
topics,—the functions of those specialists whose places in
-P-A-G-E-127
  
Specialists in the Schools 119 
the program have specially aroused the interest of our 
correspondents in the field. 
After defining the duty of specialists in general, we en- 
deavored to outline in specific terms the province of those 
specialists whose work had been discussed. We sum- 
marized first the work of the nutrition supervisor, when 
there is one on the school staff, as follows: (1) To give 
to the teacher information concerning the nutritive require- 
ments as revealed by modern research; (2) to cooperate 
with other supervisors of instruction in developing types 
of method and correlation; (3) to cooperate with the 
school medical staff in remedial work with undernourished 
children; (4) to supervise school lunches in the absence of 
any other adequately trained person. 
The second specialist whose work we discussed was the 
home economics worker. No other person in the schools 
has the opportunity she has. She has a set of principles 
which must be applied in the home, and which underlie all 
health and healthy living. She can form associations with 
teaching and administrative forces, and play an important 
part through her home economics work. Where there is no 
nutrition specialist, the program of the adequately trained 
home economics teacher should be arranged to include in 
her own school the type of work outlined for the nutrition 
specialist. She has the obligation of cooperation with 
other specialists and with the classroom teacher. 
The third specialist discussed was the physical education 
worker. Her activities are to suggest, to adapt and to in- 
spire the performance of such activities as will provide for 
the best growth and development of the individual and of 
the group based on the findings of physical examinations; 
to provide that kind of health which is organically related 
to the physical education program, in which sphere the 
physical education teacher has a unique opportunity to pro- 
vide hygienic instruction. 
The next idea developed concerned coordinating agencies. 
Cooperation between members of the school staff is only 
possible when the superintendent sees what is necessary and 
makes the necessary provision for it. The specialist 
provides the service; the superintendent must give the op- 
portunity to render the service. No matter how excellent 
your supervisors may be, they can do nothing unless the Specialists

school, 
Dalton plan, 
ete. 
  120 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
superintendent provides the opportunity to give the serv- 
ice. The principal too may provide for it. 
The best use of specialists is made where there is a 
director who coordinates the work of the specialists, and is 
responsible for administering the program as a whole, 
bringing together all services for the benefit of the child. 
The office of director serves also as a clearing house for 
health education problems and as a repository of all records. 
In such a situation, the technical details rest with the 
technical instructor. 
The next topic concerned the relation of these specialists 
to the classroom teachers. The ultimate responsibility for 
the health education of the child lies with the classroom 
teacher. The principal work of the specialist is to give 
health guidance to the teacher. Valuable services may also 
be rendered by outside agencies supplementing those of the 
school. 
The detailed development of health education in special 
types of school organization, i.e., the platoon, the Dalton, 
was not considered, due to time limitations. 
The final topic considered was how health education may 
be obtained in schools where there are no special health 
educators. The responsibility in that case must rest with 
the superintendent or with his assistants whose duty it will 
be to use the doctor and the nurses and all other available 
specially trained workers in the city, county or State, in 
order to assist the teachers on the technical side, while the 
school officials themselves provide the enthusiasm for 
health, which will inspire the principals and the teachers to 
make health a major educational objective. 
Chairman: 
The Chair would like to ask Miss Grace Schermerhorn, 
Associate Director, Health Education Division, American 
Child Health Association, to open the discussion on this 
report by commenting on the 
FUNCTION OF THE NUTRITION SPECIALIST 
Miss Schermerhorn: 
The contribution of the nutrition specialist to the health 
program has been outlined. It has also been suggested that
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Specialists in the Schools 121 
the home economics teacher will be the person to assume 
this responsibility when there is no nutrition specialist. In 
addition to what has been suggested, home economics offers 
so many other rich opportunities for the application of 
health habits, practices and knowledge, and for the develop- 
ment of desirable attitudes, that I am glad to have the op- 
portunity to present a few of the applications from this 
field. Home economics subject matter and practices deal 
fundamentally with life in the home so in our teaching we 
have equipment and situations more like the home than has 
any other department of the school. 
Below the seventh grade children are taught health les- 
sons on such subjects as sleep, rest, recreation, bathing, in- 
dividual drinking cups, eating essential foods, etc. When 
the seventh grade pupils come to home economics classes 
they have the opportunity to practice many of these lessons 
under more or less home conditions, they have the op- 
portunity to see and use and work with actual materials, 
and they have subject matter to give larger appreciation 
and understanding of these practices. 
Bed-making has always been a home economics subject 
and will illustrate my point. The pupils come to us with 
an interest in sleep, a knowledge of the number of hours 
needed, a realization of the importance of sleep, and we 
hope they have formed habits of going to bed and getting 
up at the right time. 
In the home economics class bed-making is not merely 
a matter of teaching the technique of a smooth bed and 
square corners, but through the use of real equipment and 
materials this lesson gives the opportunity to develop such 
points as.the relation of well-made beds to sleep, the best 
kind of bedding for comfort and sanitation, where to place 
the bed so as to get the best air, how many people should 
sleep in a bed, sleeping arrangements for many people in a 
limited space, night garments, care of the day garments 
during the night, and the clean body under the night gown. 
We also teach what makes the bedroom a restful place, 
such as the clean, orderly room with no useless dust col- 
lectors, pictures and trimmings that do not call out “look 
at me” but which add to the beauty of the room without 
distracting one’s thought from sleep. 
The bathroom lesson teaches not only plumbing, fixtures, Function of

tion super-

floor covering, wall coverings and how to clean the bathtub, 
but also emphasizes the relation of a clean, orderly bath- 
room to bathing, to washing the hands, to a bowel move- 
ment. If the bathroom is not clean it does not invite one 
to be clean inside and out. If one has to stop to scrub a 
tub she is not so apt to take a bath. A dirty, smelly, un- 
tidy bathroom does not encourage people to sit at a regular 
time for a bowel movement. A dirty bowl and dirty towels 
are not a stimulus to hand washing. In the grade class- 
rooms children have learned about individual towels, in- 
dividual cups, individual tooth brushes, etc., but in the 
home economics class where we have the actual bathroom 
they can learn how to equip a bathroom for these habits. 
One towel rack does not provide for individual towels for 
a family, but a school bathroom allows children to work 
out such problems in economical, sanitary ways. In clean- 
ing a bathtub if we use scratchy material that takes the 
glaze off the enamel it is almost impossible ever to get 
that tub clean again. The use of right cleaning materials 
is not a caprice but has a direct relation to stimulating right 
bathing habits in the family. 
Our clothing work is not primarily the making of clothes. 
We try to understand clothing in its relation to health. 
Washing is a necessity but ironing is a luxury. Are we 
going to have clothes which we can keep clean with a 
minimum of effort; or are we going to have clothes that 
mean hours of labor or an undue expense of money to keep 
clean; or are we going to wear really soiled clothing be- 
cause it will not stand washing or select dark clothes that 
are soiled but do not show the dirt? 
Clothes mean much to women today. Girls spend such 
a large percentage of their money on them that they do not 
have the right proportion of money left for wholesome eat- 
ing, rooming and recreation. For the average girl, skill in 
garment construction is less important than the ability to 
choose proper clothes—proper in the sense that their beauty 
gives pleasure, their style insures comfort and freedom, 
their cost is in proportion to the income, their materials 
allow for the wear intended and for the laundering that is 
necessary. 
The living-room is supposed to be a restful, joyous and
-P-A-G-E-131
  Specialists in the Schools 123 
happy place, but the furnishings alone do not make it so. 
You may have the most beautiful furniture, but if it is not 
clean, dusted and well arranged it does not invite one to 
spend leisure there. Most girls do not have an active part 
in the furnishing of the house but they may share in keep- 
ing the house so that desirable family life may function. 
If a girl can see the relation between order and cleanliness 
to rest, recreation and well-being, she will be more willing 
to help in keeping the house clean. The average home 
does not have a maid so that either things are not kept in 
such a way as to invite their being adequately used or else 
mother overworks, and does not have time for her complete 
health program. Seeing the relation of housekeeping activ- 
ities to family health and happiness adds to their interest 
and encourages all the family to do their share. 
The subject of food and nutrition offers countless op- 
portunities for teaching subject matter, for presenting situa- 
tions that provide for the actual performance of desirable 
acts, and for establishing correct attitudes towards home 
habits and practices. I can say only a word about these 
opportunities here. 
Often classroom teachers ask pupils if they like spinach. 
All hands are raised. In the home economics classes we 
serve the real food to the children. We thus have real 
evidence of whether food is liked or not. In this connec- 
tion we may drive home the importance of foods being well 
cooked and attractively served. Home economics classes 
should encourage the school gardens to raise the foods they 
want children to eat. Food that is raised and cooked by 
the children themselves calls forth appreciation, interest, 
and a desire for further investigation that other food is not 
apt to have. In addition to tasting the food themselves, 
home economics pupils may serve it to the other children in 
the school. Through lessons of this kind home economics 
may help to train children to eat by actual practice, and to 
establish desirable attitudes toward foods through happy 
occasions. 
These are the barest samples of home economics con- 
tributions to a health program but I hope the glimpse will 
encourage you all to give your home economics depart- 
ment a chance to define and live up to its possibilities. Real evi- 
dence of

Miss McCormick: 
I would like to hear Miss Knowlton describe the way

Brier ACCOUNT OF THE NUTRITION PROGRAM 
In BINGHAMTON 
Miss Knowlton: 
The need for special work in nutrition had for some time 
been felt in Binghamton by those in charge of the admin- 
istration of our health program. The need was brought to 
the attention of the teachers in many ways. They were 
urged to place greater emphasis on food habits. They 
were provided with Federal Bureau pamphlets, and those 
issued by the American Child Health Association, all of 
which served to stimulate them along this particular line 
of work. 
When the time seemed ripe for the installation of a nutri- 
tion specialist, the way for her was paved by the su- 
perintendent of schools and the board of health. We 
thought that this specialist might be able to devote her time 
to the actual development of a nutrition program. We 
tried to show the teachers that we were not adding a new 
subject to the curriculum, that this is simply another phase 
of their health work, and another activity in their big 
job of making healthy children. The time necessary for 
this work was mainly taken from the time allowed to health 
education. The physical education people had to make a 
slight sacrifice, and the hygiene people also. In our 
system all children now receive regular instruction in 
proper food habits. 
All our children are weighed once in five weeks and 
measured at the beginning of each semester by the teacher 
or by the children under the direction of the teacher. The 
principal sends to the nutrition specialist, at the beginning 
of the year and after the last weighing of the year, a re- 
port of the school which shows the specialist what improve- 
ments have been made by the school and by various classes.
-P-A-G-E-133
  Specialists in the Schools 125 
A child’s weight is reported to his parents on the quarterly 
report card. The teachers can tell from the weighing, 
whether the underweight children are gaining. The child 
is weighed during instruction period; if underweight, he 
is given special instruction in health habits, in a special 
instruction period which is on a par with his classes in 
music, reading, English or any other subject. 
Milk and graham crackers are served twice daily. 
These lunches are self-supporting. Most of the children 
pay for their lunch, but any child who cannot pay is pro- 
vided with a ticket the same as the others. Special ex- 
aminations are arranged for children at the school or in the 
dispensary and any child reported by the physician to be 
underweight, and making no progress, is referred to the 
nutrition home worker. The nurse’s follow-up may also 
supplement the work of other specialists. 
We have the cooperation of the Home Economics De- 
partment. We felt that the teacher needed more of a back- 
ground, so the nutrition specialist gave a normal course to 
the 100 teachers that enrolled for it. There were also in- 
dividual conferences in the classrooms for all these teachers, 
Chairman: 
It is most inspirational to hear this discussion which 
Miss Knowlton has given us of a piece of work in which 
all the city machinery in her city is used to keep well chil- 
dren where they ought to be, and to bring others up to 
standard before special additional corrective machinery is 
established. 
This conference group comes nearer to advocating a 
complete health program than any other group which meets 
in this country. We are all surprised at the frequency 
with which various school organizations ask how children 
can be kept up to standard. Before they attempt to put 
into operation machinery which they already have, to take 
care of children who need care, some educators desire to 
install new machinery. The work which Superintendent 
Kelly has done is certainly one of the leading pieces of 
work, in this phase, in America. 
The work of the nutrition specialist has been outlined as 
limiting itself to four lines of activity: giving information 
to the classroom teacher, cooperating with other supervisors Nutrition

on methods, cooperating with the medical staff in remedial 
work, and supervising the school lunch. Is there any 
further discussion concerning the activities of the nutrition 
specialist in the school system; or on the next topic re- 
ported upon from the afternoon session, the work of the 
home economics specialist? This second topic has been 
discussed in part by Miss Schermerhorn. Is there further 
discussion? 
Miss Marjorie L. Foster, Nutrition Specialist of New Eng- 
land Dairy and Food Council, Boston, Massachusetts: 
My work is a bit different from the work of the Food and 
Dairy Councils that has been done in other parts of the 
country. We feel that in New England we have so many 
health workers that the Council’s province is to give out 
material and exhibits to help those already in the field. 
We have a staff of three nutrition workers who are free 
to go to schools where health work is being done, or give 
inspiration for work that is about to be done. We try also 
to give new light to teachers and to others, not teachers, who 
are just starting health work among children. We do the 
work through story-telling, posters, leaflets and other 
exhibits. Our whole object is to help those who have 
started and those who are about to begin. 
Chairman: 
It would be helpful if Miss Dorothy S. Buckley, Nutri- 
tion Specialist of Connecticut Dairy and Food Council, 
Hartford, Connecticut, would supplement that. 
Miss Buckley: 
The Connecticut Dairy and Food Council operates in ten 
cities in Connecticut. We have three workers and as our 
field is so wide we cannot do intensive work. My ex- 
perience in nutrition work has convinced me that physical 
directors, home economics teachers, and others doing health 
work are able to teach health facts with the exception of 
food facts, but that they do mot know what to teach the chil- 
dren about foods or how to explain the scientific back- 
ground for the foods. Our work has therefore been to 
give the fact side of foods. As Miss Foster has said, we 
go into the schools and help the teacher by giving, perhaps,
-P-A-G-E-135
  
Specialists in the Schools 127 
a lesson on fats. The teachers say they have learned some- 
thing from these talks and have reviewed them in their 
classrooms, and that these talks have helped them in carry- 
ing out their part of the health program. 
Miss Jean: 
I want to add a commendation. About a year ago we 
had occasion to note the number of requests for assistance 
coming to us from different parts of Connecticut. We saw 
no reason for these requests coming from all parts of the 
State and from all sorts of workers so we made a study of 
our files and found there very many intelligent eager letters 
from teachers who had received their inspiration from their 
home economics extension worker, Miss Buckley. It is an 
instance of a fine piece of work quietly done. By working 
out into the State she has made it possible to develop leader- 
ship, and the other qualities we all desire, among different 
people who are working with children, nurses, doctors, 
teachers, and school administrators. 
At this point the meeting adjourned. 
The summary of conclusions and recommendations in 
regard to specialists in the school health program is given

parts of his school program to determine what procedures 
yield the most valuable returns. If he invests in school 
health work, what will it profit him? And how can he 
evaluate those profits? 
A limited round table and a general session were given 
over to a discussion of tests and measurements. ‘The fol- 
lowing contributions include the principal points brought 
out in the various discussions. 
Professor Turner stated that sometime ago, before he 
knew he was to be Chairman of Sessions, he had agreed to 
lead this discussion. He therefore opened the discussion 
by the following address on 
STANDARDS AND MEASURES OF PROGRESS 
Professor Turner: 
By what methods is an administrator to judge the ef- 
fectiveness of a health program? Health education has 
been defined as a process of training and instruction by 
which attitudes, habits, and knowledge can be developed in 
such a way as best to promote the physical and mental 
health of the child. Accepting that definition, then, you 
find four things which health education ought to affect— 
attitudes, habits of living, knowledge, and physical and 
mental health. We might, therefore, logically seek for 
results in those four fields. 
Attitudes 
I should like to deal first with the subject of attitude. 
Here is a thing which cannot be measured in pounds or 
distance, or speed, or any of the physical measurements of 
the metric system, and yet it is the most fundamental factor 
in the health education program. ‘The transformation of 
attitudes in children, which carries over to the teacher and 
to the parent, is in itself a sufficient return for or justifica- 
tion of the health education program. Let us not forget, 
in our desire to measure the prompt results of a health 
education program, that there is a time element involved. 
There are many worth-while things in life that cannot 
be measured by the metric system. You have often heard 
that the Christian religion has transformed a man in his 
relations with other people; yet his physical dimensions 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
Standards and Tests 129 
were about the same, and the number of his red blood 
corpuscles were about the same. A school system some- 
times gives health education a trial, as in Malden. If this 
trial convinces the community of the value of health educa- 
tion because pupils enjoy school better, because parents 
think it worth while, because of improvement in the at- 
titude of the children toward life, because teachers believe 
in it enough to take over more and more of the work and 
continue it voluntarily, because teachers find more fun 
teaching with an interest in the health of each pupil than 
teaching mere subject matter, then it becomes apparent that 
this attitude, although it cannot be measured in dollars or 
pounds, is proof of the worth of the program. If we had 
no other measure, this would be sufficient. The develop- 
ment of a health education program is the best device I 
know of for interesting a teacher in teaching children in- 
stead of subjects. 
Other Measurable Quantities and Qualities 
Outside the field of attitude, there are things which can 
be measured more promptly and more definitely. Let us 
not forget, however, that the health education program 
would be worth while for the effect it is going to have on 
the adult life of these pupils, and upon their children. Let 
us get a clear perspective and not become so excited about 
measuring at the end of June what we started on the first 
day of May that we forget the real educational problem 
involved. 
I saw recently the report of an experiment in which one 
group of children were shown a moving picture on health, 
the other group heard a health lecture, and in a few weeks 
both groups were weighed to see which had gained the 
more! If we are going to damn our profession by such 
experiments, we had better get back to long distance values, 
and forget entirely about methods for immediate evalua- 
tion. Nevertheless, there are improvements that can be 
measured such as improvement in sanitation or in the ap- 
pearance of children, by actual inspection for points that 
can be enumerated and set down in black and white. It 
is perhaps possible to measure improvement in children’s 
habits; and one measure of medical and nursing services 
is the effectiveness of corrective work, Attitude

  180 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
We need, and hope to get from the medical and public 
health group, a standard system for recording the physical 
condition of children so that different physicians will record 
conditions in the same way. ‘This does not mean stand- 
ardizing diagnoses but writing down in a more exact way 
the conditions found when a child is seen. We need also 
the best statistical methods for determining whether the 
school health program is resulting in more prompt and 
satisfactory corrections of physical defects. 
We have used or at least we have studied many other 
devices. In the field of physical education there are stand- 
ard accomplishment tests, and we look to the proper group 
for the standardization of the procedures. All] we can do 
here is to learn in what departments we may hope to find 
measures, and what should be the attitude of educators 
toward the use of these various measurements. 
Limitations 
I want to make a plea for two things: first, that we, as 
educators, recognize the limitations of the processes which 
we are using. We cannot hope to find measurements which 
can be standardized as definitely as land or cloth measure- 
ments. Hence, we should not be deceived by results, yet 
the difficulties in measuring and the inaccuracies should 
not discourage us into ceasing altogether to look for results. 
A Plea for Accuracy 
My second plea is for greater accuracy in the accumula- 
tion of data. If you wish to compare a child’s health 
habits at two different periods, you must, if you present 
your data to the public, state how the measures and com- 
parisons were made. Otherwise your data are useless to 
others. Some measurements, of course, need to be more 
precise than others. In our engineering laboratories we 
may need to measure to a thousandth of an inch, but every- 
thing in life is not subject to such precision. The study 
of the growth of children, as it is used in the public schools, 
is not primarily a statistical procedure but an educational 
one. Our public schools are not using scales and measur- 
ing rods for the purpose of gathering anthropometric 
statistics. The best directors of an inspirational health 
program are often people who have the ability to think in
-P-A-G-E-139
Standards and Tests 181 
terms of the individual and cannot think in terms of 
measurements at all. Such people use measurements of 
growth merely to stimulate the child’s interest. And if it 
is true of the child, as it is with some animals and plants, 
that when well and living properly he will grow faster and 
more as nature intended than when sick and living im- 
properly, then it is perfectly logical and legitimate as an 
educational procedure to use measurements to interest the 
child in his growth. Of course we want to interest the child 
in the truth; it is unfair to interest him in a lie. Our 
measurements therefore should be as accurate as possible; 
but it is not possible in a school to follow the technique 
of the pediatrician or laboratory worker and secure figures 
accurate enough for the statistician to use. 
What to Explain in Presenting Data 
When we present data we should follow scientific prin- 
_ ciples sufficiently to make sure that the people we are ask- 
ing to read the report will understand how these data were 
collected. If we do that we are fair and honest, even 
though the data may not be as valuable as if they came from 
careful observation in a laboratory. The explanations 
with data should include: How the weight was taken and 
who did the weighing, the same person or many persons? 
What was the unit used, a pound or a half-pound? How 
was the height taken? Was a standardized technique 
used? How was the child clothed? Did he have on 
shoes? How much clothing was he wearing at the time 
the weight was taken? These factors all have a bearing 
upon the interpretation of the data; they affect the precision 
of measurement, the scientific accuracy, and the reliability 
of the data. 4 
It is very important in giving figures relating to growth 
to state whether the height and weight were taken at the 
same time. We have no right to compare data from two 
different periods unless they are secured in precisely the 
same manner. In school systems and in small special 
classes it has often been the custom to take a height and 
weight measurement at one period and subsequently to 
recompute the child’s relationship to the normal, using the 
new figure of weight without re-measuring the child for 
height. If the child has increased in height as well as in What to ex- 
plain in

data

weight, the resulting statistics are not merely inaccurate, 
they are unfair. 
Your statements should tell the public how age was com- 
puted. If you have used for your group in September age 
to the nearest birthday, six months later half of the group 
will have approached another birthday and you will have 
underestimated their ages. Unless you state how the ages 
were computed, and whether once only or at each weighing, 
the person who reads your figures will not know how much 
allowance to make for the method you have used in col- 
lecting your data. I believe this is fundamentally im- 
portant. Educators should be as accurate as possible. 
They should not try to present data which will be unfair, 
and they should be honest in saying just how the data were 
collected. Data which do not carry such a statement must 
be thrown away; data which do carry such a statement can 
be evaluated for what they are worth. 
We are an educational group and the development of 
standards, particularly such standards as must come from 
the laboratory or the pediatrician, is not our job. Let us 
first recognize clearly the value of things which cannot be 
measured; and let us not deceive ourselves into thinking 
that at the end of the year we must show in pounds or 
dollars the full value of everything we have done. 
In the second place, let us accept and use methods and 
standards that are fairly well worked out and simple and 
definite. Let us recognize that there are other things not 
so simple, not so definite, not so well standardized. Let us 
try to secure from the groups which should supply us with 
standards better methods than we now have to fit the limited 
scope of a school system. Let us collect our data as well 
as we can. Let us not be deceived about the value of 
weighing and measuring as a teaching device. And let us 
appreciate the fact that health education has been dem- 
onstrated to so increase the interest of teachers in their job 
and in their pupils, transform the attitudes of children 
toward the habits of daily life, and sell itself to parents, 
that these evidences alone are enough to convince us of 
the soundness of the program we are about. 
Professor Turner here resumed the chair and called 
upon Mr. Philip S. Platt, Associate Director, Research 
   
-P-A-G-E-141
  
Standards and Tests 133 
Division of the American Child Health Association, to con- 
tinue the discussion. 
NINE PracTIcaBLe TESTS 
Mr. Platt mentioned nine tests in addition to those sug- 
gested by Professor Turner. Mr. Platt said that these 
tests, he believes, are all fairly fool-proof—they are rather 
simple objective tests, which a school teacher or admin- 
istrator can apply to certain measurable features of the 
health program. The tests suggested by Mr. Platt are 
these: 
1. The number (or better, the percentage) of physical defects 
corrected. 
However, until we can standardize the terminology and the 
method of examination, and stop talking about “the total 
number of corrections” and “the total number of physical 
defects’? we shall get nowhere. Corrections must have rela- 
tion to specific defects and be significant. 
2. A record of absences due to illness (pupils and teachers). 
Difficulties will arise even in keeping such a record as this, 
in determining the cause of absence in doubtful cases. When 
it comes to a matter of diagnosis, that is the doctor’s province. 
It is important that intensive study should be made of this 
subject by research men. 
3. The health habits of pupils. 
A fairly satisfactory way to measure health habits is to use 
a questionnaire similar to the one used by the American Child 
Health Association in its survey of eighty-six cities. The 
child does not sign his name to the questionnaire and is not 
marked on his performance. The total returhs give the 
teacher a fair estimate of the health habits which are prac- 
ticed and improvement can be measured by giving the test 
at several different times, say three months apart. 
4. Test of knowledge. 
Completion tests are a better way of testing knowledge than 
the older types of examination. (Miss Strang, of Columbia 
University, will have more to say about the newer methods of 
testing knowledge.) 
5. Performance tests. 
Children sometimes have difficulty in understanding the lan- 
guage in which a question is written, but may be able to 
prove, by doing the thing called for in the question, that 
they have the health knowledge. Performance tests are a 
slower method than completion tests. Practicable

6. Tests for measuring the physical health and optimum develop- 
ment of the child. 
It is difficult to say what tests should be used here, but there 
are a few which may be applied, that are sometimes over- 
looked, such as: 
What percentage of the pupils are protected against small- 
pox? 
What percentage are protected from diphtheria? 
7. Physical ability performance tests. 
There are a number of these, no one of them sufficient in 
itself. Such tests may encourage a child to beat his own 
record, and to obey the health rules in order to reach a higher 
standard of performance. The college training table is evi- 
dence of the willingness of young men to obey health rules 
for the sake of athletic achievement. 
8. What the trained physician, making a thorough examination, 
can tell us of the child. 
Even physical defects, if properly recorded, are negative 
measure of the child’s health. Terminology needs to be 
standardized, however, and a better, and a standardized 
method of recording, needs to be employed, both in regard to 
defects and positive findings, before we can consider such rec- 
ords an accurate measure of the children’s physical condition. 
It is, however, a possible method of measurement. 
9. A measure of the healthful and unhealthful features of the 
school environment. 
One line of questioning concerns the building, architecturally, 
and its suitability, from a health viewpoint. The other line 
of questioning concerns the present status of the building and 
how it is being used: 
Is there over-crowding? 
Are children using soap and towels? 
Are individual paper drinking cups provided? 
Is the temperature of the room tolerable? (Not above 70° 
at the most?) 
Are the seats properly adjusted? 
Are the floors and windows kept clean? 
(There are many other suitable subjects of inquiry along this 
line.) 
Mr Platt mentioned some general principles which 
should be considered in making measurements of any kind, 
as follows: 
Define your terms. Another person reading your record 
must be able to tell exactly what you are talking about. 
Just now a conference of statisticians has met to stand- 
ardize record forms; they recognize the necessity for ab- 
solute agreement on terminology.
-P-A-G-E-143
Standards and Tests 185 
Determine the scope of your interest, by explaining 
exactly what it is that you want to do. For example, are 
you simply making records of work accomplished, or are 
you making records which may be used for investigative 
purposes? Only recently I was interested in the question 
of carrying on an investigation of the prevalence of dental 
caries in the mouths of colored children. I had an op- 
portunity to visit a splendid piece of prophylactic dental 
work which was being done by an organization in one of 
the public schools. It was reporting accurately the amount 
of work that was being done, but it was missing a rare op- 
portunity to record one or two items of information which 
would have taken only a moment or two and which would 
have added immeasurably to the value of the reports. For 
example, it was not possible to tell the records of the white 
children from the colored, or to tell the racial stock of the 
child, or to tell whether a child with no unfilled cavities 
had otherwise perfect teeth or five or ten cavities filled. 
Now, of course, this was not the purpose of the study, but 
would it not have been worth while to have done it and 
made a valuable contribution to the subject of caries among 
colored children? 
Establish your point of departure. Unless you make a 
definite record of conditions at the start, you cannot pos- 
sibly measure your progress. ‘This is absolutely funda- 
mental to any measurement. Ascertain the limitations of 
your methods. One must know what figures are essential 
in order to use them soundly. If you don’t know let the 
community help you. Go to the instructor in mathematics 
in the high school and say tohim: ‘Am I using my figures 
wisely? Have I enough cases here to make my figures 
significant?” Making use of the community will help you 
to guard yourself against errors in the use of figures. 
Chairman: 
We should like to have other contributions to this dis- 
cussion of the standards by which an administrator can 
judge the effectiveness of his health program. We can 
group these standards under three heads: 
1. Tests, records and statistics, physical improvements, 
educational results. Record the 
point of de- 
parture  
-P-A-G-E-144
  186 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
2. Relation of absence, retardation and tardiness to 
health work. 
3. Morale of pupils, teachers and parents. 
May we hear from Miss Ruth Strang, Assistant in Health 
Education, Teachers College, Columbia University, on: 
THE VALUE OF KNOWLEDGE TESTS 
Miss Strang: 
The health information tests to which Mr. Platt referred 
are tests of what a child knows, not what a child does or 
what he feels about health. We all realize that the 
purposes and the habits of the child are of primary impor- 
tance; but knowledge also is important to serve as a motive 
for forming habits, and also for giving an intelligent idea 
of how to adapt himself to new situations. The abilities 
that this health information test seeks to measure are as fol- 
lows: (1) Stating what are desirable practices in regard 
to choice of food, clothing, exercise, and so on; (2) stat- 
ing the reason why a certain act should be performed; (3) 
stating what are desirable attitudes; (4) stating what 
would be the best thing to do in a certain situation. 
May I read several examples? There is a choice of five 
alternatives, and the child is to mark the one best answer. 
The best temperature for a room in which one is sitting 
and reading is between 
60-64° F. 
65-68° F. 
72-75° F. 
76-80° F. 
80-85° F. 
The man who discovered that blood circulates through 
the body was: 
Pasteur 
Bryan 
Harvey 
Winslow 
Wood 
This type of test was chosen because it is easy and in- 
teresting and quick to take; and is easy for the teacher to 
give and score. 
One value is in finding out just what knowledge of health
-P-A-G-E-145
Standards and Tests 187 
the children have already acquired when they come to the 
teacher at the beginning of the year. By giving a test of 
this kind she can find out what facts the children know and 
thus prevent reteaching. 
A second value is in furnishing a motive to the child to 
learn more about health. 
A third use is to help the teacher diagnose the difficulties 
of the individual child. She can look through the list 
of items and see where the child’s failure to achieve good 
habits may be due to a lack of knowledge of just what is 
the best thing to do. 
Finally, a teacher who has taught health education for a 
year really wants to know what desirable changes she has 
made in that child. One group of desirable changes is in- 
crease in knowledge. The standardized test is probably 
the best way of measuring achievement in knowledge. 
Chairman: 
We would like to hear from Dr. Carr. You had some 
experience, Dr. Carr, in measuring the results of your pro- 
gram. 
ABSENCES DUE To ILLNESS 
Dr. Carr: 
I will emphasize the one point that the child is not re- 
sponsible for absence due to contagious diseases, particu- 
larly colds and sore throat. When you investigate you 
find almost invariably that they are due to community con- 
tacts, not to school contacts. From a doctor’s standpoint, 
contagious diseases in school, resulting in absenteeism, are 
about our biggest problems. We want to keep our chil- 
dren in school. In one school in Trenton, the principal 
said that they had lost eleven years due to illness. We 
measure our absences due to illness and teach the child 
something about contagion. Next year I will hand you 
some statistics as to the measurement of contagion. 
Dr. A. S. Barr, Assistant Director, Board of Education, 
Detroit, Michigan: 
Such measures as are used should measure ultimate 
values rather than subject matter goals. Take an example 
  Use of 
knowledge 
tests 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
188 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
from the field of safety education. Safety education has 
to do with the saving of human lives, and one measure of 
safety education is whether the instruction given really 
saves lives. If a statistical study of accidents shows 300 
lives lost by accidents in 1916; 250 in 1918; 200 in 1920; 
pecaare 150 in 1922 and 100 in 1924 we can believe that the in- 
ultimate struction has produced results. It is of no value to know 
waines that pupils can repeat by memory the seven rules of 
safe living or pass successfully examinations in books 
read. 
It is so with health education, which also has to do with 
the saving of lives. Does a statistical study show (a) 
fewer deaths among school children, and (b) fewer ab- 
sences because of illness? 
A second measure of progress in health instruction is the 
changes in the percentage of children having physical de- : 
fects. Medical inspection and remedial measures have for ) 
their aim the removal of physical defects. Statistics 
should show results. In a similar manner height and 
weight may be used to measure the progress of normal 
growth, simple physical tests to measure increased physical 
ability, and so through the list of health goals. Objective 
measures in terms of ultimate ends need to be established. 
Chairman: 
Has Miss Mary E. Murphy, Acting Director, Elizabeth 
McCormick Memorial Fund, anything to say on this sub- 
ject?   Miss Murphy: 
This subject seems very well covered, but I would like to 
say that from the angle of the health teacher we have to 
consider statistics from two angles, that of health, and the 
absence of it. One value of having a teacher pay atten- 
tion to these factors in her class program is that she really, 
for the first time, recognizes bad health and bad health 
habits, in terms of the child’s ability to function in the 
school room. 
I have in mind a child from a well-to-do home who was 
frequently tardy. An examination into the cause indicated 
that he got up at the last moment, having gone to bed late,
-P-A-G-E-147
  
Standards and Tests 189 
ate practically no breakfast, ran to school, and naturally 
was late. This would be of no value statistically, but it 
would be considered in any health program. 
The emphasis I should particularly like to make has 
already been made, which is that there are many changes 
that cannot be put down in black and white, which are 
probably worth more than others than can be put down. 
Dr. Andress: 
I am tremendously interested in this subject of measure- 
ment and in the various objectives that have been set be- 
fore me. I wonder if we are remembering how difficult it 
is to measure some things. I am reminded of a story 
which Colonel Parker told of a young lady who had many 
suitors. To determine which one to take, as each one made 
his appearance and proposed to her she tried to measure 
him in percentages,—so much for the amount of money he 
possessed, so much for his appearance, so much for his 
manners, etc. She made out a very careful schedule. She 
really had leanings toward a Mr. Smith, but finally she said 
to him: “Mr. Smith I can’t possibly accept you, because 
you are only 744%4% and it takes 75% to pass.” Such 
measurements of course are ludicrous. 
In Newton, where I live, I have four children in the 
public schools. The city has distinguished itself from the 
health point of view, especially in health habits, and in the 
creation of a constructive attitude on the part of the teach- 
ing staff and the children toward health and health habits. 
This comes in large part, I think, from Miss Bragg’s per- 
sonality: its influence on her teachers, and their influence 
on the children. Journeying through the schools we feel 
this atmosphere. We can’t measure this attitude in fig- 
ures. We know it exists because the children seem to have 
a joy in the health work; because they are learning to be 
successful in many ways and are developing proper atti- 
tudes toward health. We need to use common sense in 
our health work, determining what is possible in the situa- 
tion in which we are placed, and to measure success in rela- 
tion to the possibilities in the situation. I believe in the 
highest possible standards. A teacher needs to understand 
what is possible for a child to do, and emphasize suc- Beware of 
absurdities 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
cess in relation to that. This helps to create the attitude of 
success. 
I want to emphasize also the desirability of teaching 
children, not subjects. We need to get the cooperation of 
the child. 
Miss Maud A. Brown, Director of Health Education, 
Fargo Child Health Demonstration, Fargo, North 
Dakota: 
I know Dr. Andress well enough to know that he doesn’t 
mean, any more than we mean, that a wide gulf is fixed 
between those of us who work for the physical health of 
Attitudes; the child and those of us who work for the mental, spiritual 
morale and moral health of the child, for physical health and 
mental health are merely two viewpoints of looking at ex- 
actly the same thing. Isn’t that true Dr. Andress? I be- 
lieve that we can hope to achieve a collective health attitude 
which will be constant and permanent enough to measure. 
I believe it is our duty to try to achieve this attitude and 
find units in which to measure it. I believe that if we try 
persistently and consistently enough, we will have measur- 
able results. Attitudes are expressed in behavior. Any 
permanent change in attitude will result in a permanent 
change in behavior of some sort; and behavior should be 
subject to measurement, The chief difficulty about meas- 
uring attitudes is in getting the attitudes. 
Miss Cara L. Harris, Director of Health Education, 
Rutherford County Child Health Demonstration, Murfrees- 
boro, Tennessee, said that the school health program has 
beneficial effect on the morale of pupils, teachers and pa- 
rents. An attitude is sometimes measurable by what it will 
accomplish. She illustrated this point by personal observa- 
tions which had convinced her that a change of viewpoint 
in some one important thing may cause a complete change 
in attitude toward that thing and hence a change in be- 
havior. She continued: 
“Unquestionably the attitude of the students, teachers 
and parents must be given an important place in evaluating 
the results of a health program. Whole hearted effort on 
the part of the teachers, students and parents to encourage 
and secure the correction of defects, to strive for healthful
-P-A-G-E-149
Standards and Tests 141 
environment, and to feel responsible for observing health 
regulations as well as to urge others to do so, is the mani- 
festation of effectiveness. 
“As the child spends only a part of his time in school, a 
very limited number of points can be checked under the im- 
mediate direction of the health specialist. The child is to 
a large extent dependent upon the knowledge and ability of 
his parents, and upon his own initiative, to make health 
information and health facilities serve his needs.” 
Miss Anne Raymond, Special Health Teacher, Play- 
ground Athletic League, Baltimore, Maryland, called atten- 
tion to the effects that could result from errors in measuring 
height. In a school she visited, all the children were re- 
corded as overweight. Looking around she saw a great, 
big, lean, skinny boy, and said to him: ‘Are you over- 
weight, too?” ‘Yes, I’m overweight.” Then she said, 
“You come upstairs with me. I want to weigh and measure 
you.” The whole trouble was that his height had not been 
taken accurately. This tall boy was called overweight, 
when he really needed to put on about ten more pounds. 
Another time, a lady stopped her on the street and said: 
“Harry has grown so big he has outgrown all his clothes, 
but his teacher does not find him any taller than he was at 
the beginning of the year.” Here was a mother who was 
losing faith in the method! 
Miss Raymond mentioned another case in which the cor- 
rect weighing of a child started her to building up her 
weight by eating spinach, drinking milk and going to bed 
early. She used to go to the grocery store and every time 
she went she bought spinach. 
Miss Raymond mentioned that Maryland is working out 
some standard tests. 
Chairman: 
We all believe, I think, that we need better methods than 
we now have for measuring health improvement. A stand- 
ardized method of recording the physical condition and 
physical defects of school children would be extremely use- 
ful. Throughout the States there is little uniformity for 
recording physical defects. Two or three groups are work- 
ing on this problem at the present time. We need also Results of

definite, standardized procedures for measuring and weigh- 
ing children. 
Miss Jean: 
Miss Brown has an excellent outline covering these 
points and I suggest that we ask her to present her ideas. 
Miss Brown presented the following outline and the Con- 
ference voted to include it in its minutes. 
TAKING AND RECORDING MEASUREMENTS 
Since this is a body for the consideration of educational 
procedures only, I offer this tentative definition of our posi- 
tion with relation to the use of weight standards, bearing 
in mind the fact that the determination of the relative 
validity of standards is the province of the pediatrician and 
the laboratory worker. 
I. That the use of weight-height-age standards is a 
valuable tool for developing and sustaining the effort of the 
child for health improvement. 
II. While this use is quite distinct from its scientific 
use as the basis for drawing conclusions, its educational as 
well as its diagnostic validity depends upon the accuracy of 
the taking and reporting the measurements. ‘The teacher’s 
record as to weight and height, if taken thus accurately, 
can become useful diagnostic data for the physician’s use. 
III. The teacher in taking the weights and heights, 
to safeguard the results, should insist 
1. That scales be standardized periodically and balanced between 
weighing of each group. 
2. That the child be weighed in indoor clothing, without shoes. 
3. That he stand quietly in the center of the platform. 
4. That height be taken at the same time, the child standing 
erect. (Heels, hips, shoulders and back of head touching a 
smooth, unyielding surface, upon which an unyielding stand- 
ardized tape is securely fastened.) 
5. That the height be taken with a square or box (not ruler or 
book) to guard against tilting. 
6. That average weight for height and age be computed from the 
Baldwin-Wood table. That in using this table, the nearest 
inch and birthday be used, that the higher figure be used when 
half way, i.e., fifty-six and one half inches be called fifty-seven
-P-A-G-E-151
  
Standards and Tests 143 
inches, and six and one half years be called seven years. 
7. That the use of any percent of deviation from this average be 
recognized as a purely arbitrary convenience and by no means 
indicating its validity as a diagnostic instrument, other than 
as one of a number of indications derived from the physician’s 
examination of the child. 
8. That the weight, height and degree of deviation from average 
be reported periodically to the home. 
9. That weight be taken monthly, height three times,—at the begin- 
ning, middle and end of the school year. 
IV. That we as teachers do not concern ourselves with 
most technical questions as to the standards, but accept 
from the technicians the concensus of opinion as rapidly as 
it is given out. That at present this limits us to the use 
of the table at present accepted by general agreement—the 
Baldwin-Wood—and to the general teaching that progres- 
sive falling below this standard is a negative indication as 
to the health condition. 
At this point the meeting was adjourned. 
The final summary and recommendations in regard to 
standards and tests of progress are given on page 232.

Rounp TasiE Discussion 
Miss Elma Rood, Chairman 
Chairman: 
\ E are to discuss materials and devices which may be 
used in teaching health to the children; also, meth- 
ods, devices and materials that may be used in teacher 
training courses. Materials may include source material, 
reference material, visual material used in the classroom, 
material which might help in correlation with other sub- 
jects, outlines which might be used, and any other material 
which might be brought into the class to help in the de- 
veloping of a health lesson. 
In order that we may get the setting of the development 
of health material, Miss Jean will tell us something about 
the early development of health education materials. Baldwin-

  The fact 
that a book 
sells is not 
enough 
  144 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Miss Jean: 
With the view of interesting children in health habits 
and practices, the Child Health Organization, very soon 
after its organization in 1918, published the Child Health 
Alphabet. The verses were by Mrs. Frederick Peterson; 
the form, color and design were patterned somewhat upon 
a little book issued by the International Health Board in 
France. The popularity of this first attempt to produce 
attractive health literature led the Organization to believe 
that well illustrated, brightly colored, carefully printed 
books could be used to teach health effectively. So we put 
out Cho Cho and the Health Fairy, wherein Miss Griffith 
launched the idea of using the fairy story as a vehicle in 
interesting younger children. ‘These and others have had 
an enormous circulation, and though sold at a very low rate 
have paid for themselves. A publishing house has now 
taken over the printing and distributing of these books, 
which indicates not only that such publications are salable, 
but that the demand warrants the attention of business 
firms. 
We all recognize the need for a greater variety of reliable 
and well-written health books which can be used in cor- 
relating health teaching with other subjects. These can 
only be secured by demanding them of the publishers. 
They will give you what you want. One firm, in response 
- to a recent criticism of a publication, said “It sells! 
Twelve States have adopted that book,” the inference being 
that as long as old material is sold, why prepare new mate- 
rial? As school books are selected usually by a group 
known as the text-book committee, it is important for local 
workers to urge the appointment of at least one person on 
such committees who is informed in regard to modern 
health teaching. The rapid progress in scientific matters 
and in the health field necessitates constant supervision of 
health texts used in our schools. 
Familiarize yourself with books now in use in your 
schools. Secure expert opinion on them, if necessary, and 
see that only books which are suitable for the age of the 
child, accurate in content, and sound in method be used. 
If you have a high standard as to content and form, and 
if you are not willing to have antiquated unattractive texts 
used, then such books as you desire will be produced by
-P-A-G-E-153
Standards for Materials 145 
the publishers and by the commercial firms to whom we 
are indebted for much helpful material. 
Chairman: 
One consideration in judging material must be as to 
whether it has a scientific basis of fact. I am going to ask 
if Miss Bertha M. Wood, Dietitian at Northfield Semi- 
nary, East Northfield, Massachusetts, will tell us what she 
thinks about a scientific basis of fact as one way of judging 
health material. 
Miss Wood: 
Be sure of your facts. It has always seemed to me that 
charts, stories, illustrations, primers—all of these things 
we get out—are vehicles to carry facts. If they do not they 
are of no use. Worse than all, they may cause collisions 
which bring about bad results. I believe that all our sto- 
ries, all our charts, all our books, ought to have a scientific 
basis on which to stand. Artists may have “artists’ li- 
cense”’ to make colors a little more vivid, and line drawings 
a little stronger, a license which we, as health people, have 
no right to take. 
Be sure that your pedagogy is right. In making a story 
I first make a skeleton of the list of the facts I want to get 
over to the reader. Next, I get a criticism of the facts. 
Then I make the story. Take, for example, that story 
about the calf. When I had made the skeleton, I sent it 
to various places to make sure that it was true, that the 
scientific basis was sound. Next, I found out whether the 
pedagogy was right. I wanted that story to be a vehicle 
to carry scientific facts, and I didn’t want to get my facts 
into some old wagon that would break down. I sent the 
story to story-tellers whose books are selling and whose 
books are getting over into the hearts of children. Now 
you know that your facts are right, your pedagogy sound, 
and your story in shape to tell. But that is not all. 
Be sure the illustrations are good. ‘There is no such 
thing as illustrations that are too good. It is hard to get 
them good enough. I would submit the illustrations to 
some of our leading people, sometimes more than once. 
When criticisms come back, don’t have any “pets.” Just 
accept the fact that your vehicle may be bad. For myself,   
If you 
would write

ries—

I had rather leave a piece of work undone than put it be- 
fore children and have them sit there perfectly dull and 
quiet. 
Be sure your first sentence is a good one. A man who 
has been doing a good deal of public work recently said to 
me: “The first sentence is the one that is going to carry 
an audience along, or leave it behind.” That is worth 
knowing for our charts. Our first sentence or statement 
must get the attention of the child. That first statement to 
be presented ought to be criticised by people who know 
more than you or I know; and it is better to have that crit- 
icism before, rather than after the material is published. 
It is hard to get the right kind of criticism of material. I 
wish we might have a bureau to criticise material for us. 
In conclusion I repeat: don’t put out anything that is 
not sound scientifically; don’t put out anything that is not 
sound pedagogically; and don’t put out anything that is 
not true art. 
The Chairman asked Miss Harriet Wedgwood, formerly 
with the United States Bureau of Education, to speak in 
regard to health education material. 
Bureau of Miss Wedgwood said that the need for suitable material 
Education —_js evidenced by the sales of this material by the Govern- 
ment Printing Office and by letters to the Bureau of Edu- 
cation from teachers, superintendents, women’s clubs, 
parent-teacher associations and school nurses. The 
Bureau’s health education material that was prepared by 
the Child Health Organization owed its attractiveness to 
Miss Jean. The war had brought home to our Govern- 
ment the need for a healthier race of men and women. 
How bring this about? Might it not help to make an 
urgent appeal to the teachers of the country? So attrac- 
tive pamphlets were prepared. That was in war-time. 
Rulings have since been made against wasting (!) money 
on inexpensive but attractively colored covers and twelve 
point type for these small pamphlets. Material need not 
be unattractive in order to be inexpensive. At ten cents, 
or less, small pamphlets could have paper without gloss, 
and heavy enough to prevent the type and the cuts showing 
through, large type, ample margins and spacings, some  
-P-A-G-E-155
  
Standards for Materials 147 
good illustrations, and covers in attractive colors. These 
things have been done; they can still be done if the people 
want them and make their wants known. 
Professor Turner, when asked what he thought of havy- 
ing authorities to pass upon material to be used for health 
teaching, replied that this seems not the best way to teach 
health or develop health teaching. This has been brought 
home by an existing law which says, in effect, that every 
health text-book shall devote a fifth of its content to the 
subject of alcohol and tobacco. People probably agree 
that every meal should contain some sweets; but how fool- 
ish a law would be that required every course served should 
be one-fifth sugar. If it becomes necessary to have the ap- 
proval of a governmental agency on health text-books, we 
must do what we can to see that the right kind of people are 
appointed, and have it understood with the publishing group 
and the school group that there are standards which must 
be developed. The right kind of material, and the right 
kind of help in individual schools, have in a great many 
instances meant the difference between success and failure. 
Miss Foster, upon being asked to describe material pre- 
pared by the New England Dairy Council said: “Here 
in New England we feel that as we have many health 
workers, the business of the Council is to give out ma- 
terial and exhibits to health workers already in the 
field. We have very little material for the upper grades, 
especially for the high school. That has been one of our 
big problems. We endeavor to help other health workers 
by story-telling, posters, leaflets and exhibits, not only 
school teachers but anyone trying to do health work among 
children. We try to reach the mothers by making our 
pamphlets suitable for home use. Many teachers have 
enough leaflets to send some home at least once a month. 
We try very hard to find an illustrator who knows in what 
things children are interested. We have tried to get out 
material which we could sell at a reasonable price, always 
welcoming criticism and aiming at better material.” 
Miss Louise Stanley of the United States Department of 
Agriculture, stated that their Bureau of Home Economics 
can furnish a bulletin on School Lunches, one on Food for Effect of 
governmen- 
tal regula- 
tion of 
what shall 
be taught

Young Children, and a long series of popularly written 
bulletins on different phases of nutrition. These bulletins 
are available for free distribution as long as the supplies 
last. Lists of available bulletins can be obtained on appli- 
cation. They are anxious to get exhibit material and are 
in a position to prepare movies and exhibits. Some ex- 
hibits, now in preparation, were planned with a view to 
getting the nutrition story across in the Western Range 
States that have special nutrition problems and special 
problems of food supply. 
Miss Anne Whitney, Associate Director, Health Educa- 
tion Division, American Child Health Association, was 
here asked to tell about securing material for a project she 
carried out with a group of children in a fourth grade. 
Miss Whitney: 
A year ago this past winter I did some health teaching 
An interest- 12 connection with a fourth grade. I was with the class 
ing fourth for one hour a week only, and I was anxious to have my 
grade Prol- hour with the children correlate closely with their regular 
daily program as I realized my weekly lesson would not be 
effective otherwise. I, therefore, undertook to make the 
health teaching correlate with the work the class was doing 
in history. This happened to be the colonization period 
in American History and we chose that part centering 
around the Pilgrims and Plymouth. 
I found that in order to get the source material necessary 
for doing that piece of work well I had to go to libraries 
which would not be available to the average teacher in the 
average classroom. Also it was necessary, if the correla- 
tion was to be a legitimate one, that the children should be 
acquainted with the source material themselves as far as 
possible. If you are teaching history you must follow all 
the principles of the teaching of history. 
It was a very interesting experiment. The children di- 
rected the project themselves. They decided they would 
like to study the daily life of a child in the Pilgrim days, 
and they organized “The Child’s Day” according to health 
activities. They said: ‘The first thing we must do is to 
find out what we do for health during the day. Then we 
can determine what to look for in the life of the Pilgrim
-P-A-G-E-157
Standards for Materials 149 
child.” They then proceeded to go to source material to 
find out the opportunities for health activities which the 
Pilgrim child had. 
Another interesting point was the reaction of the chil- 
dren to the material discovered. They found that milk 
was not available for two years after the arrival of the Pil- 
grims and this was a big hardship to the children. Some 
said, ‘““We have all the milk we want to drink. Let’s use 
it.” Several began to use more milk as a result. 
They found out that fruit was an essential of diet. In 
one of Governor Winthrop’s diaries he made note of the fact 
that scurvy was checked at one time by the arrival of fresh 
fruit from Bermuda. This tied up with the food lessons 
being given by the home economics department. 
They made discoveries in regard to rest. The lack of 
lighting facilities in colonial days determined an early bed 
hour, and they found that the Pilgrim children went to bed 
earlier than they did. 
In the end they decided it was so interesting that they 
wanted the third-grade children to make a similar study the 
next year. They tried to work out a scheme to interest 
them which resulted in plans for a lecture, with lantern 
slides. These were made of card-board and were run 
through a lantern brought by one of the boys. Each child 
took a topic and delivered a part of the lecture. The 
subject matter was selected in the health class but the form 
and delivery were supervised by the classroom teacher as 
a part of her class work in oral and written English. The 
slides were made by a committee of children. 
The project covered a period of about three months. 
Unfortunately, as I was in China the following term, I 
could not follow up the effect of the experiment. I do not 
know whether the interest was carried on by these children 
into the fifth grade. 
My hope is that this short study will have given them a 
richer understanding of child life in early colonial times 
as well as more interest in their own everyday health 
activities. 
Miss Rood: 
Miss Whitney sent us her outline and several teachers in 
Mansfield worked on the same topic. The teachers went 
  Using source

-P-A-G-E-158
Need of

rial 
  150 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
to the library in search of source material. Only a few of 
the necessary books were in the library. The rest could be 
obtained for a short period of time from the State Library 
if it were definitely known that they would be needed; or 
they could be had by sending to the Congressional Library. 
This meant that we could have the books for only a limited 
time, and we would have to manage to get them at exactly 
the time we would need them, which was difficult to tell, 
so we did not succeed in making use of the plan. 
Miss Jean: 
It might be well to have a small pamphlet prepared in 
connection with topics of that sort, giving source material 
and referring to the publication. 
Miss Rood: 
That would be invaluable to us. Librarians have a lim- 
ited fund to spend for books each month, and are not justi- 
fied in spending money for health books unless there is 
a sufficient demand for them. If we can create the de- 
mand, they can spend the money. Until this demand is 
created they spend it for fiction or whatever the people wish. 
A demand is now being created, for mothers asking at the 
library for health publications are told that all the books on 
the health shelf are out. 
Miss Reba Harris: 
Some recent experiences make me feel that we must put 
the right kind of material into the hands of the teachers if 
we want them to get the right kind of subject matter for 
their work. We loaned the State normal school some ma- 
terial and the librarian told me that at all times during 
the day there were at least three or four at the table where 
that material was placed. The school is anxious to have 
students gather material in unit fashion. ‘They divide the 
students into groups, and the groups gather all the mate- 
rial they can on one subject. One group had the subject 
of health. They had no source material other than what 
we sent; and that was copied material, because the risk of 
losing the originals was too great. I believe we should 
have thoroughly sound material, attractive and inexpensive,
-P-A-G-E-159
  Standards for Materials 151 
and put it where teachers can see it; and that we should 
give directions for selecting the good from the bad. A 
clearing-house to pass upon material would help solve the 
problem. 
Chairman: 
The rural teacher is a long way from any library and 
often does not get to one oftener than once in eight or twelve 
weeks. How can we put into her hands the material she is 
not able to buy? Her salary is so low that she cannot buy 
the materials she needs everyday. We are providing out- 
lines in the normal schools; the average rural teacher may 
be provided with nothing but a physiology in which a lesson 
on the nose begins by asking, ‘““What is the nose? Where 
is it located?” How are they to get the material that is 
really going to make healthy lives in their schoolrooms? 
One of the outstanding needs we feel every day in our 
work is for material which will help the teachers in correla- 
tions, so that when we talk to them about correlating health 
with history they won’t look at us vaguely. They have 
some idea of what we want, but nothing definite; and we 
have nothing that will help them. If we had a United 
States history with suggestions for correlating health and 
history, it would be fine; and the same with geography. 
Definite information as to the relation between geography 
and health would help the teacher tremendously. 
Miss Abbot: 
In meeting the needs of the teachers are we also consider- 
ing the needs of the children? We know that supplying 
children with absolutely perfect tracks for perfect trains to 
run on, and supplying them with electricity by which to 
run the trains, is not nearly so educational as giving them 
crude implements and letting them make things for them- 
selves. I cannot believe that any teacher, once she gets to 
know what the principle of correlation is, will want a thor- 
oughly worked out scheme. Let the children do it. They 
are much more inventive than we are. Furthermore, I 
think that a scheme of correlation all worked out for the 
teacher would be wrong for her; what we need is enough 
suggestions to keep the teacher going. Material to

Chairman: 
What Miss Abbot has said about the underlying prin- 
ciple is very true, but I am going to give an illustration of 
what I mean. If a teacher is teaching about Japan, she 
teaches it as she has always taught this, without having the 
health aspect in view, unless we show her how to do it in 
a different way. She does not know nearly enough about 
the people in Japan to bring out the habits of the people as 
she would like to do. When she goes to the library for 
source material, she finds that it just isn’t there. We are 
trying to get our library to put in such material to stimulate 
the teacher; but until more material is available we must 
provide some of it for her. 
Miss Abbot: 
I’m glad, Miss Rood, that you illustrated what you 
meant. It is source material. There is a tremendous need 
for that. We can’t expect teachers to get facts out of their 
heads. 
Chairman: 
The weakest point in our rural school is the primary 
grade. The reason is that so many of the teachers lack 
special training. What is your feeling about using some 
children’s work to stimulate other children’s effort? We 
have found that we get a better response from pupils if we 
show the original work of other children, even when it is 
crude. 
Miss Abbot: 
There is a principle involved here about which some 
people are confused. We want crudity in children’s mate- 
rial, not because we admire crudity, but because we ap- 
prove of the original expression of the child. The crudity 
of adults and of children are two entirely different things. 
I heard someone say once that a teacher who knew how to 
get child expression was a wonderful teacher. We want 
the joy of the child in producing that expression or result. 
These expressions are human documents, representing per- 
sonalities. In them we see individuals in the making. I 
was much interested once to go into a first grade and see
-P-A-G-E-161
Standards for Materials 158 
a drawing assignment that was being given to the children. 
The teacher gave out the rhyme, “Little bluebird in the tree, 
sing a song for me,” and asked the children to draw pic- 
tures of it. I still have some of those pictures; they are 
most interesting as human documents. The one picture 
that wasn’t interesting was drawn by a child who repro- 
duced something given by the art supervisor the day before, 
—and that child was a defective, without imagination. 
Real child expression, which is necessary if a child is to 
grow, cannot be otherwise than crude. 
That does not hold good of material prepared by adults 
for the child’s use. We must be careful when we make up 
crude plays and have children go through them as mario- 
nettes. It is not desirable that we should use adult wits to 
invent clumsy things that are neither imaginative nor child- 
like. This crudity is an entirely undesirable and unneces- 
sary expression. 
Miss Dolfinger: 
I agree that children always get much more out of a 
lesson where they have constructed the material themselves. 
After they have had the satisfaction and interest of creating 
it, it is desirable to let them see how it should be if perfected, 
that they may have no doubt as to the quality they are to 
strive for. 
In regard to source material, I should like to call 
attention to a valuable book which may have been lost 
sight of. During the War there was produced, by a num- 
ber of collectors of source material, a publication bearing 
on foods, building, and many subjects directly related to 
health, arranged in pamphlets for the use of elementary 
schools and high schools. The underlying idea was to 
introduce the child reader to the human side of industry. 
It was published by the Department of the Interior in 1918 
and was called Lessons in Community and National Life. 
Series A is for upper classes of the high school; Series B, 
for the first year in the high school and the upper elemen- 
tary grades; Series C, for the intermediate classes of the 
elementary school. ‘These pamphlets can be obtained from 
the Government Printing Office. The price of Series A 
is twenty-five cents; of Series B and C, fifteen cents each. Valuable

  154 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Dr. Andress: 
The American Medical Association in “Hygeia,” covers 
all fields of health. It is written by both physicians and 
laymen. All articles of course are authentic. I believe 
libraries would be willing to circulate this magazine, which 
costs $3.00 a year, among rural teachers. I have found it 
interesting and helpful. 
Miss Jean: 
Magazines would carry better material if the public 
asked them to do so. When you find an article that is 
good, write and tell the publisher that you want such arti- 
cles. If you want articles along health lines, go to the 
magazines and say so! 
Dr. Elizabeth Kemper Adams, Educational Secretary of the 
Girl Scouts, New York City: 
Isn’t it possible to get State boards of education to get 
out magazines for teachers? 
Chairman: 
Our State board of education (Ohio) has cut down their 
appropriation for the rural districts. 
Miss Frances Klein, Assistant Editor, Massachusetts De- 
partment of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts. : 
Our department circularizes the rural teachers with ma- 
terial, and holds a series of conferences on health problems 
in every normal school in the State. We take one special 
subject each year, such as nutrition, hygiene or health 
education. 
Miss Helen Teal, Assistant Director Public Health Nurs- 
ing Service, American Red Cross, Washington, D. C.: 
The series of health books put out by the National 
Health Council will be helpful as source material. There 
are several pamphlets in the set and the price is thirty cents 
a pamphlet. 
Chairman: 
Last year I noticed that there was a good deal of helpful 
material, songs, health plays and the like in “Normal In-

Standards for Materials 155 
Dr. Andress: 
Could we get over to the publishers the idea that we 
would like to have incorporated in books on history and 
geography matters pertaining to health? If we could have 
the material put into the books, the children would have it 
in their hands. 
Chairman: 
Any one who has had to do with school programs that 
include thirty-eight classes a day is keen about correlation, 
it is the only possible way to get live health teaching. 
Miss Dolfinger: 
I should like to call your attention to a book by Ellsworth 
Collins, entitled An Experiment with a Project Curriculum. 
It does not deal specifically with health, but shows the way 
by which many things can be taught effectively at one time 
in an ungraded school. If I were face to face with that 
problem, I should buy that book and use it constantly. 
Miss Wood: 
When I was making a study of foreign born people, the 
missionary societies put me in touch with people who were 
intelligent and knew facts. I wonder if rural school 
teachers have ever thought of using the various missionary 
societies ? 
Miss Jean: 
We ought to be able to draw upon our National and State 
departments for much source material. ‘Teachers ought 
to have the best possible material, and beautifully printed. 
Health should be associated only with the highest standard. 
Chairman: 
If it is agreeable to you we will pass to the second topic: 
WHAT ARE THE PROPER USES OF ILLUSTRATIVE 
MATERIAL? 
The average classroom teacher has to draw on all kinds 
of sources for helps in teaching. For example, children 
in rural districts for some reason do not like to eat oatmeal. 
We have to change their attitude in regard to it. We used An experi- 
ment with a 
project cur-

a picture of a broken-down old horse and asked the chil- 
dren to express their ideas of him. They said: ‘He is too 
thin.” “He doesn’t get enough to eat.” ‘He would stand 
without hitching!” Then we showed the picture of a very 
fine horse. They liked this one very much. We asked 
them what they thought these two horses had had to eat; 
and in this way we worked round to the point we wanted to 
teach. 
I should like to hear about your illustrative material, 
how it has been used in the classroom, and how it is tied 
up with other subjects. 
Miss Dolfinger: 
To me the keynote of the whole use of material, to de- 
velop thought, goes back to what Miss Abbot said a few 
minutes ago about mechanical toys. If you use pictures, 
books, plays, stories, in fact any kind of finished illustra- 
tive material, and simply put it into the hands of a child, 
you are not developing much thought on his part, because 
there is no activity on the part of the child. Unless you 
give the child material which interests him, and which he 
can work over in his own way, you will not get far. Par- 
ticularly helpful with little children is the use of concrete 
things in their own environment. Even such things as ap- 
parently dull and uninteresting city statistics can be tied up 
with other things in a way that makes them interesting. 
To be more specific, in the upper grades we are fre- 
quently told how important it is to have children come to a 
realization of the relationship between their behavior and 
health. Ifa child goes home and attempts to plot his home 
surroundings so as to find out the proper places to put 
waste, it makes more of an impression on his mind than 
if you merely talk about it. If you are making a study of 
the water supply, it is more important to take the child to 
the place where the city water supply is, and have him see 
the water and the surroundings, than it is just to talk about 
it. For the upper grades, if you can get the statistics over 
a period of years from the city health department (as I am 
sure you can) regarding certain water-borne diseases month 
by month, you can bring home to the child the importance 
of being careful to know where water comes from, especially
-P-A-G-E-165
Uses of Illustrative Material 157 
when drunk on hikes and on picnics. You can then tie 
that up with the child’s citizenship responsibility and make 
the thing constructive. You can make him see what his 
city health department is for. 
If you are dealing with the milk supply, take the child 
to a good dairy and let him see how it is run. He will see 
enough to show him how things should be handled in his 
own home. After that you can use material from the State 
board of health, or the State university, which is il- 
lustrative, and which falls then into its own proper place as 
source material. The child will go to this material in order 
to strengthen his impressions. Such material as this, has 
to be looked over before it is used, and requires a teacher 
with vision and a point of view to use it accurately. We 
need, more than anything else, the production of scientific 
source material. We need to consider the possibility of 
getting our science teachers in our high schools and normal 
schools, and our city health advisers, to give us simple state- 
ments of fact, which older boys and girls can use in their 
nature study and civics, to illustrate, explain and interpret 
their environment. We have to go to such authorities as 
we have. An excellent project for a high school class is to 
make or collect such material for the fifth grade, and an 
excellent experiment in high school English is to put into 
terms that the fifth graders can understand, an exact state- 
ment of the water supply of that city, how it is handled, 
etc. In other words, you can get some of your illustrative 
material from the upper grades of your own school system 
and from your own normal school. 
In regard to readily available material, a good deal has 
been produced by organizations interested in the health of 
children. Material from commercial houses, advertising 
material, is sometimes very helpful but you should always 
submit it to the teachers in your high school, normal school 
or university science department to make sure that the 
facts are sound. Most of the big firms put out excellently 
supervised material; yet some advertising material is quite 
misleading because it is the old story of “‘a little knowledge.” 
We need good color charts to be used in connection with 
science classes. Some of this may be produced by the arts 
and crafts classes. How to use

Dr. Andress: 
Why could we not form committees to collect authentic 
material in relation to civics, history, etc. and put it into 
Use of biog- Shape so that it can be used? Biography offers good ex- 
raphies amples in both physical and mental hygiene. Abraham 
Lincoln developed the habit of meeting things fairly and 
squarely; that is good mental hygiene. He chopped wood, 
and that had a good effect upon his physical health. :

HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRESS 
HREE brief contributions which were presented at 
different meetings, are of general interest, and are 
given below. 
In response to a request from the floor, Miss Mary Hahn, 
in charge of the health education experiment conducted by 
the Women’s City Club of Cleveland, told how she had 
helped Cleveland teachers organize a health education 
program. 
DEMONSTRATION IN ELEMENTARY HEALTH EpUucATION, 
CLEVELAND, OHIO 
Miss Hahn: 
The health education demonstration in the elementary 
schools of Cleveland had its birth in the Kinsman School, 
nearly three years ago, when work for mal-nourished chil- 
dren was instituted there under the direction of the 
Woman’s City Club. This work has been continued and 
a thirty-hour extension course in The Health Education of 
Children is offered for elementary teachers. 
ee Demonstration teaching is done in the classrooms of 
tion teachers enrolled in this course. Credit for the course is 
given by the Cleveland School of Education. Of the fifty 
teachers and principals enrolled, most of them came from 
the two elementary schools connected with the demonstra- 
tion. Both subject matter and methods of health education 
are given in the course, and one of the requirements is a 
written report of not less than ten health lessons which
-P-A-G-E-167
Paper eer Rc eons AR rae ae orn ae eee ee ere Pheer saree deem eee ne Pee ae 
Demonstration Teaching 159 
have been taught by the teacher, with a statement of the 
proper method of approach, an outline of the subject-matter, 
and a summary of results obtained. 
Most of the teachers felt handicapped because their pro- 
gram had no definite period for health education, but most 
of them have now learned to correlate health with the sub- 
jects of the established program. Gratifying results were 
in every case apparent when a teacher discovered how to 
apply a particular health lesson to her special group. Con- 
ference discussions emphasized elementary health education 
as a problem of the classroom teacher. ‘These gave oppor- 
tunity for the health worker to give special suggestions and 
offer teaching material. 
To arouse community interest, a health pageant was ar- 
ranged by the teachers and the health worker. In one 
school, where it was possible to repeat the pageant with 
variations after a period of six weeks, a marked improve- 
ment in effort and results was apparent at the second per- 
formance. 
Dr. Peter Tutyshkin, Professor of Neurology and Pedol- 
ogy at the Moscow Medico-Pedological Institute, Moscow, 
Russia, spoke on 
HeaLtH EDUCATION IN RuSSIA 
Dr. Tutyshkin: 
The new educational system in Russia is not a special 
subject in the curriculum of normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges but the fundamental principle of every educational 
subject in the “unified,” or “one-plan,” labour school. 
This is the new type of school in Russia. 
Within recent years a new problem appeared, that of 
“race regeneration.” To meet this problem a new biologic- 
hygienic science was born. In Russia it is called ‘“‘pedol- 
ogy.” Its realization came through the eugenic school. 
Russian pedology is a combination of health and pedagogy 
which explains why many physicians, psychiatrists and 
neurologists are at the head of educational institutions, as 
I have been for many years. Such physicians, neurologists 
and psychiatrists must also be specialists in education. 
A special college whose purpose is to create a new class 
of workers qualified in physical training and mental hy-
-P-A-G-E-168
  Russia’s 
new type of 
school   
160 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
giene—or eugenic education—of children has been func- 
tioning in Russia for the last five years. This college is 
the Medico-Pedological Institute at Moscow. Pedology 
pays attention not only to the internal factor of child devel- 
opment—heredity or genetics—but also to the external fac- 
tor of the child’s development, the all-inclusive social 
environment, including nutrition and influences affecting 
nutrition, and the social environment which together with 
the reflexes of the child, result in various types of behavior. 
The new Russian school is a school of activity, as op- 
posed to the passive receptivity characteristic of the old Rus- 
sian schools. The activities which meet the requirements 
of physical and mental hygiene and the natural develop- 
ment of the child are self-government and self-service by 
the children, the method of conducting excursions, and self- 
activity in developing creative powers and abilities. Spe- 
cial gymnastic exercises and futile games of amusement are 
excluded from the curriculum. The following activities 
are emphasized: Care of the premises, agricultural la- 
bour, care of animals, various forms of manual labour 
under hygienic conditions, and the rational, hygienic or- 
ganization of labour. We insist upon “applied health 
education.” 
The health-educational school has an intimate connec- 
tion with the surrounding population; this connection in- 
creases the sound natural interests of the growing children 
and develops creative abilities in a way to satisfy the re- 
quirements of physical and mental hygiene. 
Health education in the sensitive life of children de- 
mands that the starting point must be the experience of 
children; or, as we see it, the environment as reflected 
through the prisms of childish impressions. 
The new Russian school aims to assist the child to ac- 
quire the knowledge, skills, and habits, and the robust 
physique, necessary for the life struggle. Our schools are 
polytechnic, as opposed to monotechnic, whether they be 
handicraft schools or schools of other forms of learning. 
The industrial school may be a health educational work- 
shop, the agricultural school, a farm-sanitarium. 
To schools like these we put, for collective solving, simple 
problems of the health-organization of labour. We wish 
to create, in these children, sound social working habits.
-P-A-G-E-169
Health Education in Foreign Countries 161 
We aim to develop the social instincts through united hy- 
gienic labour, physical and mental. 
A well-known psychiatrist, Dr. Larursky, of Leningrad 
(formerly Petrograd) created a new practical system of 
schools on the principle of the so-called ‘natural experi- 
ment,” the socio-physiological and hygienic study of the 
behavior of children in artificial environments. This is 
the new educational psychology of Russia. The healthful 
regulation of this behavior is the new health-educational 
pedagogy of Russia. The eugenic Russian school focusses 
attention on the aspects and requirements of child develop- 
ment: physical growth; mental, emotional and social life; 
material labour; play, art, etc. In Russia all our educa- 
tion is health education.

THE ADMINISTRATOR’S PROBLEMS OF 
HEALTH EDUCATION IN TEACHER- 
TRAINING INSTITUTIONS 
Section I 
HEALTH OF THE STUDENT TEACHER 
PRELIMINARY DiscussION BY THE TEACHER-TRAINING 
SECTION 
Mr. George H. Black, Chairman 
S this meeting was rather informal, and included a 
discussion of two topics (the “Personal Health of 
the Teacher in Training” and “Freshman Hygiene”) the 
report of it has been divided, rearranged and somewhat con- 
densed, for the benefit of the reader. 
Throughout the discussion, no one questioned the need 
to conserve the health of the teacher in training, the only 
question being “How can it be done?” Following are the 
main points brought out in the discussion of the health of 
the student teacher. 
The Chairman was asked to describe the health program 
of the State Normal School at Ellensburg, Washington, of 
which he is president. 
Chairman: 
For the past five or six years we have been trying to de- 
velop a program of health education that would care for 
the daily life of our students. We take health for granted 
and deal only with those things which mean a distortion 
of the normal situation. We assume that people are 
serious-minded; and with that assumption we are organized 
in as simple a way as possible. 
162
-P-A-G-E-171
  
Health of Student Teacher 168 
We feel that the administrator of the school is responsible 
for the health of the student teacher. Our organization of 
student welfare and control is headed by the president of 
the school and includes the following groups of people in 
different lines of work but all working toward this particu- 
lar end: health education, nutrition, social life, housing and 
personnel studies. The head of the psychology department 
is an important factor in this whole group. 
One side of our work is instruction. The other side is 
the direction and personal care of the students themselves. 
This latter part of the program is under the control of the 
students, and worked out for the benefit of the students. 
They feel therefore the responsibility of leadership in carry- 
ing out the program. They study and assume responsi- 
bility for their own problems; we help them to work them 
out. 
Our school has taken over supervision of the living con- 
ditions of the students. I believe we cannot separate the 
scale of living from the health program. The scale of 
living is determined by the things which are necessary for 
a student’s well-being and satisfactory adjustment to life. 
We are usually forced to upset the habits of living of 
the students when they first come to us. We have to teach 
them better ways of caring for themselves. When they 
become adjusted to the routine we require, they find they are 
better off than previously. 
To bring about this readjustment requires the coopera- 
tion of many instructors, who have to forget the work of 
their particular departments for a while and devote them- 
selves to this task of readjusting the habits of living of these 
young people. 
We believe that the right way is always the easiest way. 
We assume at the beginning of our work that we are in- 
creasing the sensitiveness of our young people. It is fun- 
damental that they should live in a congenial environment. 
Therefore we insist that everybody must be comfortably set- 
tled where he can be happy, before he has any assignments. 
We go into the business of housing the students of whom 
there are from 1,000 to 1,200. We house about 200 women 
and sixty men students in our own dormitories, and we en- 
gage 150 to 200 rooms for eleven months. We guarantee 
the rent, so we can require the standard of hot and cold Supervision 
of living 
conditions 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  Housing of 
students 164 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
water as a part of the contract. We first assign rooms in 
the dormitories, in the order of application; then the outside 
rooms, for which the students pay us, as they are rented to 
us. We make any necessary adjustments with the people 
who let the rooms. We do not intend that a student shall 
rent a room and in three weeks quarrel with the person who 
owns the room, and go to some other place. The student 
is guaranteed that his food and shelter will be properly 
looked after, and he must either live in the rooms we pro- 
vide, under the regulations made by the students, or cancel 
his membership in the school. We would rather not have 
a student than have one that is dissatisfied. 
The program is under the control of the students. Stu- 
dents often point to themselves as examples of the good re- 
sults of this program and the sense of leadership it devel- 
oped. In so far as the health program is compulsory, it is 
so because the students themselves insist it shall be so, and 
carry it out. | 
Our students consider their own cases. When fifty or 
sixty were overweight and asked for special tables in the 
dining-room, they got them. 
Occasionally a girl says she has no money to pay for the 
correction of defects. We seldom find this is really true 
and we do not accept “Can’t afford it” as a reasonable ex- 
cuse. Ihave seldom found a dentist or doctor who will not, 
if we ask him to do so, wait for his pay until a student is 
earning. Once in a while there is a girl who really cannot 
afford to have corrective work done. We then get some 
organization to give assistance but we do not advertise that 
we do this. 
We made an analysis of infirmary calls and found that 
Monday had the highest number of infirmary calls all the 
way through, ranging from twenty-one to twenty-four. 
Young people who go home over week-ends or on week-end 
parties see clearly by our chart the need of control. “Late 
leave” is also necessarily restricted although if there is some 
‘especially fine entertainment in town we give an extra late 
leave. We do not aim to make rules that we cannot break 
sometimes. 
Some cases that go to the infirmary need better mental 
hygiene. One such girl was a frequent repeater. The
-P-A-G-E-173
  
Health of Student Teacher 165 
head of the infirmary turned her over to the recreation de- 
partment, where a real program was set up for her. Soon 
she was over her trouble. This case received instruction, 
the services of the resident nurse, and the constructive help 
of the physical education department. The last was what 
she most needed. With her program of activities she en- 
tirely got over the infirmary habit. 
Girls who need to be in the infirmary for illness have 
physicians to handle their cases. We shall have one physi- 
cian next year who will take care of all the heart and lung 
disorders. 
A girl out of class, must be accounted for. If she re- 
mains in her room, either in our dormitories or in the 
affiliated dormitories, the matron must report the case 
to us. 
We keep a record of absences from classes. Monday 
forenoon has the largest number of absences. We keep a 
record of absences due to digestive disorders and the num- 
ber is surprising. We traced a large number of cases oc- 
curring at one time and found that nearly all were traceable 
to Thanksgiving vacations or boxes of food from home. 
Our chart of absences has shown the need of better self- 
control and self-regulation. 
The school pays for required physical activities. The 
students have a fund which pays for extra activities such as 
horseback riding and week-end camping. 
We have three courses in health education. I would say 
this, however, that the mere giving of courses in health 
education, while desirable, may not result in a program 
you wish to have carried out. Not until we instituted our 
present health education program at Ellensburg, and 
really saw the problems connected with it and with the life 
of the students, were we able to get results. Our three 
courses in health education are now definitely a part of the 
whole health education program. 
We have a personnel director, who looks after the hous- 
ing and after such matters as the hours of sleep, etc. of the 
students themselves. With this director we have a large 
enough group of students to set the standard. We found 
that absences from classes were traceable to low standards 
of living so we developed this system. Analysis of

Dr. Andress: ; 
Do you get different results from students who go home 
at night and dormitory students? 
The Chairman admitted that very limited results were 
achieved with those who live in their own homes. 
Dr. Andress: 
I have in mind the State normal school at Hyannis, 
Massachusetts, an institution of not more than fifty or sixty 
students. The main reason for having this school is the 
summer sessions. It has been difficult to develop a health 
program where some live in dormitories and some at home. 
Mrs. Kathleen W. Wootten, Director of the Health De- 
partment, Georgia State College for Women, Milledgeville, 
Georgia, confirmed this viewpoint by saying: ‘We have 
quite a problem in our school because some of the students 
do not live in the dormitories. We try to conserve the 
health of students and for this purpose aim to have all our 
departments correlated with the health department.” 
The Chairman then requested contributions to the subject 
from others present, saying: ‘‘What is being done in the 
institutions you represent, to safeguard the health of student 
teachers through any plan undertaken for the physical ex- 
amination of the students?” 
Dr. Burdick: 
In all Maryland normal training schools the student 
teachers receive medical inspection, so that they will go out 
in as good condition as possible. 
Dr. Hart: 
A physical examination comes with the student health 
service at Syracuse University. Everybody is required in 
the freshman year to take this examination. There is a 
follow-up if they are not in standard condition. 
Dr. Cornell: 
Every girl who goes into the normal schools of Penn- 
sylvania is examined when she enters.
-P-A-G-E-175
  
Health of Student Teacher 167 
Miss Anna E. Richardson, Dean of Health Education, 
Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa: 
Our Hygiene Department examines every new student 
who comes to college and makes recommendations as to 
the number of hours of work she can take. If the student 
is normal, she is allowed to take what she wants, within 
ordinary limits. 
Cards are sent regularly to my desk with the names of 
the girls who are in the hospital and why they are there. 
We have a woman physician and men physicians. When 
the girl leaves the hospital she is sent to the proper depart- 
ment for corrective treatment. 
For the past year we have been studying the problem of 
how to get the Home Economics Division to function best 
in the program. We are still struggling with the problem. 
Our main work is training home economics teachers. 
Health education is a part of our program. We aim to 
present our work so that it will function in three ways, each 
of which has relation to the entire family: First, health 
for every member of the family; second, sound economic 
standards for the entire family; and third, fine social rela- 
tionships in the family. 
This definition of our aims is helpful because it is con- 
crete. We used to present our home economics work from 
the standpoint of home making; now we want it given from 
the standpoint of maintaining the family health, physical, 
economic and social. I know of no institution where cor- 
relation of home economics with other branches is easier 
than at Iowa State College, because Home Economics is a 
separate division, and the arts and sciences are given pri- 
marily for the purpose of serving our technical division. 
The arts and science people say tous: ‘Are you satisfied? 
Are you getting just the sort of subject matter you want 
from our departments?” This attitude is very helpful 
to us. 
One thing we did was to form a health council. We felt 
that health education was an important part of our train- 
ing. We started from the standpoint of women first. We 
felt that living conditions must be studied, also social life; 
and we must know whether we are giving students the right 
opportunity to spend their leisure time. 
We made a study of the courses in the college and pos- Iowa State 
College 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
University 
of Texas 
and Univer- 
sity of Iowa 
  168 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
sible correlations. We found a real opportunity for cor- 
relation in the Public Speaking Department, which includes 
dramatic work, plays and recreation,—direct correlation 
between health education and recreation. This recreation 
is not a part of the physical education; we call it social or 
dramatic recreation. The people,in this recreation course 
are interested in the community and in how to use their 
time wisely. 
There is a close correlation between our home manage- 
ment courses and health education, as our home manage- 
ment department studies the use of time to save physical 
effort. One of the great problems of the overworked house- 
wife is how to maintain physical health. One of the in- 
teresting things about this study of correlation is that every 
department is determined to show that it has something to 
give to health education, for with us health education is 
popular. We feel that the art of living is a very important 
thing. I think this may show you at least the direction in 
which we are going. 
Miss Jean Pinckney, Health Education Lecturer, Uni- 
versity of Texas, Austin, Texas, said she thought that we 
are all inclined to think of health education as belonging 
mainly to the department in which we are interested, but it 
is not nursing, not mental hygiene, not nutrition, not physi- 
cal training, but all of these. 
Dr. Don M. Griswold, Professor of Hygiene, University 
of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, in reply to Mr. Black’s remark 
about student control: 
The institution from which I come has 7,400 students, 
and it is impossible to do anything in the matter of control 
with so many. I think we can attempt such a thing only 
by making it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong; but 
to attempt to control the life of the student, as is possible 
in other places, would be a waste of time. We have, all 
through the Middle West, a feeling of independence which 
must be considered in developing a health program. If I 
suggested to a farmer that his child was undernourished 
he would say: “Why are you concerning yourself about 
it? Heis my child. Why should you worry about him?” 
We must somehow make health desirable to our students.

Health of Student Teacher 169 
Miss Gertrude Dudley, Director of Physical Education for 
Women, at the University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois: 
I am not representing a Teacher-Training Department. 
Our work is health work for the students, but we find it 
difficult to correlate the courses in an institution where there 
is such opportunity for election of subjects as is offered at 
the University of Chicago. The greatest amount of co- 
operation is between the Departments of Medicine, Home 
Economics and Physical Education. We have very few 
students—practically none—who are absolutely excused 
from registration in our department. But to many students 
an “A” counts for more than perfect physical condition. 
Every student receives a rather complete medical ex- 
amination including a urinalysis. The underweights are 
put in one of three classes: One group to take full exer- 
cise; another group, restricted exercise; the third, a rest 
program. As these students make progress, their activities 
may be increased. The few who have the rest program 
without activities, are under the supervision of a medical 
adviser to whom they report. 
Our underweight students usually have some type of 
recreational work (rather than the older type of so called 
corrective work) and meet for weekly consultations with 
the Department of Home Economics. While they meet in 
groups, the work is largely individual. A student whose 
activities are restricted may substitute attendance at the diet 
class, for attendance at a physical education class. Her co- 
operation in following the health program is a determining 
factor in her physical education credit. 
Miss Lou Lombard, Nutrition Worker, Massachusetts De- 
partment of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts: 
What is the nature of the diet class? 
Miss Dudley: 
Charts are used upon which the students record their 
weekly work, diet schedules, daily health program includ- 
ing hours of sleep, and there is a general discussion of 
health habits and also individual consultations. This is 
the second year of this work. This course given by the 
Department of Home Economics is one of the best practical 
elementary dietetics courses I know of. No particular em- University 
of Chicago
-P-A-G-E-178
  A practical

dietetics 
  170 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
phasis is laid on chemistry, but a practical application of 
food principles is made. Laboratory demonstrations are 
made of the amount of food needed for growth and 
development. 
We ask our deans to urge all underweight and over- 
weight students to take this course before they leave the 
university. Moreover the entering student receives a list 
of the courses we recommend every student to take. This 
list includes a course in general physiology with laboratory 
work twice a week, courses in eugenics, and courses in 
psychology. Such courses we believe to be fundamental to 
good citizenship. 
There are two questions I should like to hear discussed: 
First: Provided the Home Economics Department and Physical 
Education Department are well coordinated, what means are you 
going to use to get the rest of the staff working together toward the 
common end of health for students? 
Second: What methods can be used to stimulate the vigorous per- 
son to keep vigorous and to bring the others up to a healthy standard ? 
Chairman: 
I went to the University of Chicago one summer in an 
overworked condition. During that summer I gained 
twenty-seven pounds. Why could not any student, young 
or old, get the right point of view and use the institutes in 
the summer to improve his health? That is where guidance 
comes in. Perhaps if I had not already attained to certain 
personal standards of living I would not have been able to 
utilize the opportunities offered to me in the University of 
Chicago. Many girls and young men come from homes 
where the utilization of their own facilities has not been 
emphasized, and sometimes their standard of living is not 
very high. 
Miss Abbot: 
In your arrangement at Ellensburg how do you get hold 
of people who think only in academic terms? 
Chairman: 
We bring them all together, just as we are here. We 
talk things over. Sometimes they are open-minded and 
get the new viewpoint; sometimes not.

  Health of Student Teacher 171

Will Miss Elma Rood, Director of Health Education at 
the Mansfield Child Health Demonstration, Mansfield, 
Ohio, tell us how she looks after her student teachers’ 
health? 
Miss Rood: 
My program is small in comparison with the programs 
you have been talking about. I have charge of the health 
work for a small town normal school in Ohio, typical of 
hundreds of county normals all over the country. Our 
school trains teachers who will go into the rural schools. 
The students come from all kinds of home conditions. 
Many of them live at home and drive back and forth a 
great many miles each day. A good many do light house- 
keeping. Many do outside work in order to pay their 
expenses. Some earn money enough to take courses else- 
where later on. 
Our students are given a physical examination when they 
come in. We had twenty-two students this year and ex- 
pect thirty-five next year. Since their living conditions 
vary so greatly, and since many are doing outside work, 
I have found it necessary to have a personal conference, 
to talk over their problems, with every student at least 
once in six weeks, especially if a second weighing shows 
a decrease in weight. The students all know that we 
watch their weight carefully and closely. We do find a 
difference in results when the pupil does light housekeep- 
ing or work of some kind; but since the students are going 
out the next year to live under conditions perhaps not as 
good as they are under right there in town, we feel it is 
a good idea to get them to feel that they are directly re- 
sponsible for their living to the director of the normal 
school. 
This year many of the students increased their weight, 
and many had defects corrected as far as they were 
financially able to do so. They have to consider carefully 
anything that involves a great deal of money expenditure. 
We often have to consider whether we might be taking food 
away from those students, when we insist that they get their 
teeth fixed or have their throats examined! 
I do not know whether anyone else here has a problem 
just like ours; but I think if we find some solution in this Mansfield,

one little normal school, it ought to be useful for hundreds 
of normals all over the country. There are fifty-two right 
in Ohio, all struggling along in the same situation as we 
are. 
Chairman: 
Is it actually a fact that they cannot afford to have their 
teeth attended to? Do they not just think they can’t af- 
ford it? 
Miss Rood: 
No. We have investigated this matter. When they say, 
“Father says that he can’t afford it this year, I shall have 
to wait until next year, when I am earning my own money,” 
itis the truth. We have succeeded in getting noses, throats, 
eyes, and ears examined; but when there are defects that re- 
quire a large expenditure for their correction, it is a dif- 
ferent matter. In this type of school you have to know the 
student’s living conditions very well indeed before you can 
advise intelligently. 
Chairman: 
We have had students who told us they could not afford 
this or that thing but actually they were not willing to spend 
the money that way. In the few cases of absolute need, 
which of course we do find, I go to some organization and 
say: ‘Your members have been anxious to do some social 
service work.” JI state the case without mentioning names 
and we get the money. But personally I am in favor of 
doing away with the “can’t afford” argument. 
The remainder of the time at this meeting was given to 
a discussion of freshman hygiene, which is reported as a 
separate topic (p. 177). 
Jornt Discussion 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
The Chairman asked for a report of the preliminary dis- 
cussion, at the teacher training session, on the subject of
-P-A-G-E-181
Health of Student Teacher 178 
SAFEGUARDING THE HEALTH OF THE STUDENT TEACHER 
Mr. Black summarized, stating that it was agreed that 
in teacher training institutions the administrator, whether 
he be the president, principal, dean, or some other person, 
should have the direct responsibility for organizing a con- 
structive health program and take upon himself the task 
of securing coordination between the general health educa- 
tion program and any other type of work which is in any 
way related to this health program. 
It was also agreed that the beginning of the work of safe- 
guarding the health of these young teachers in training 
should be a systematic physical examination, by some per- 
son competent to give such an examination. Diagnosis 
should be a matter of record and the student teacher should 
know that record and be faced with the responsibility of 
undertaking a program for constructive correction. It was 
agreed also that any physical examination which does not 
continue with follow-up work, is wasteful. The follow-up 
program must be well organized and must look toward the 
correction of defects. The responsibility then goes back to 
the administrative head of the institution. 
The Chairman then called upon Miss Elizabeth M. 
Murphy, Supervisor of Health, State Board of Education, 
Concord, New Hampshire, to tell something about her work 
in the normal schools of New Hampshire. 
Miss Murphy: 
We have this year, for the first time, examined all the 
students in the normal schools of our State. The examina- 
tion was a very complete one and was given by two women 
physicians. Special cases were referred to specialists. 
The teachers have been tremendously interested, and a great 
deal has been accomplished through this examination. 
We found one active case of tuberculosis. The girls who go 
to our normal schools are required to have a health certif- 
icate before they enter. This certificate must be signed by 
a girl’s own doctor certifying that the girl is in perfect 
health. 
Dr. Burdick asked what follow-up work was done after 
the examinations. Responsi- 
bility of the 
administra- 
tive head
-P-A-G-E-182
  New Hamp- 
shire normal 
schools 174 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
Miss Murphy: 
We are doing special follow-up work and we have our 
physician reexamine special cases to see that the necessary 
corrective work is being done. I think that by the end of 
this summer practically every remedial defect will have 
been corrected. We sent notices with a letter to the parents 
explaining the defect, and the need of correction. 
Miss Dolfinger asked Miss Murphy whether a girl would 
be allowed to graduate if defects had not been corrected. 
Miss Murphy: 
I doubt very much if a diploma could be withheld. 
Mr. Black: 
In the State of Washington there is a law covering the 
case of tuberculosis; but all our teacher training institu- 
tions may withhold a certificate for any reason they con- 
sider sufficient to disqualify a girl for the service. The 
law reads this way: on the completion of certain courses 
a diploma may be granted. The law does not say that we 
must, or that we shall, but that we may grant a diploma. 
That protects us from court proceedings in such cases. 
However, I would say that our students willingly participate 
in our program and have their defects corrected. If you 
have a health morale pretty well established in your school, 
cases hardly ever get to the point of being pressed. 
Miss Jean asked: “Is there any attention given to 
conditions other than tuberculosis and other such marked 
defects? We all know that students may be quite free 
from epilepsy and tuberculosis and still be unsatisfactory 
human beings from a health standpoint. Is anything be- 
ing done in the New Hampshire normal schools toward 
bringing about the result for which we are all working,— 
a thoroughly well, strong human being?” 
Miss Murphy replied by repeating that examinations 
were but recently started in New Hampshire and that 
though their first efforts were to correct serious defects, they 
had as an ideal, the development of “thoroughly well hu- 
man beings.”

Health of Student Teacher 175 
Miss Annie S. Crowell, Director of Health Education, 
State Normal School, Hyannis, Massachusetts, was asked 
to speak on 
HEALTH AT THE SUMMER ScHOooL, HyANNIs, Massa- 
CHUSETTS 
Miss Crowell: 
About 500 teachers come to us as students during our 
July session. No student may take more than two subjects. 
This means that a student works in class for an hour and a 
half, then attends general assembly exercises, then works 
for another hour and a half. The amount of time an in- 
structor may require of his students, in preparation for 
class work, is agreed upon in faculty meeting. Thus the 
principal of the school sees to it that the faculty is giving 
consideration to the matter of safeguarding the health of 
the students. 
The administration encourages recreational activities and 
has organized the school into elective recreational groups. 
The result is that every afternoon practically every member 
of the school is out of doors and engaged in hiking, auto- 
mobiling, sailing, swimming, camping on the beach or do- 
ing something else in the way of recreation. As the five 
weeks go on, we find many of these teachers growing more 
and more rested and rosy. A large number of them testify 
that the summer has been to them a health summer as well 
as one of professional refreshment. 
Dr. Cornell: 
In the city of Philadelphia good physical health is re- 
quired of all teachers entering the public school system. 
The majority of the teachers who enter service are recent 
graduates of the Philadelphia Normal School, at which in- 
stitution a physical examination is given to every entering 
freshman student and a second examination to every senior 
student before graduation. A second group of teachers 
entering the service are those who have had teaching ex- 
perience elsewhere. With these a physical examination is 
part of the examination for entrance into service. Phil- 
adelphia, however, has no provision for ascertaining the Hyannis, 
Mass., Nor- 
mal School

-P-A-G-E-184
176 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
physical health of the teaching body after they begin their 
teaching. 
The consideration of the health of the pupil in the normal 
school is a different proposition from that of the health of 
the pupil in the high school. A normal school is a teachers’ 
college and the authorities have the right to prescribe stand- 
ards of fitness, both physical and mental. 
The physical standards used in Philadelphia in the ex- 
amination of prospective teachers include consideration of 
tuberculosis, general nutrition, condition of heart, sight and 
hearing and consideration of any condition of health which 
would seem to make the prospective teacher unfit for teach- 
ing service. It is not expected that the applicants will be 
in perfect physical condition. However, we have made it a 
rule that a candidate who requires eyeglasses or dental at- 
tention will not be passed until even minor defects have 
been remedied. Candidates for teaching positions in the 
high schools are judged by standards slightly different from 
those used for elementary grade teachers. 
The candidates for teaching positions who fail to pass the 
prescribed physical examination are brought before a board 
composed of the superintendent of schools, director of 
medical inspection, director of examinations, a district su- 
perintendent of schools and a district medical supervisor. 
This board passes final judgment. The final decision is 
therefore made by an impersonal committee, not by one 
person. 
At this point the meeting adjourned. 
The summary and recommendations in regard to the 
health of the student teacher may be found on page 224.

SEcTION II 
HEALTH EDUCATION COURSES IN 
THE CURRICULUM 
EFORE this conference was called it was known that 
most of our teacher training institutions give some 
course in hygiene. The courses in different institutions 
vary greatly in aims, methods and scope. In some in- 
stitutions the course is given in the freshman year, and 
linked up closely with the student health service. The 
aim of such a course is to secure and maintain the personal 
health of students. In other institutions the course gives 
subject matter and methods for teaching hygiene. This, 
therefore, was a subject which people wished to have dis- 
cussed. ‘There were invited to this conference, therefore, 
representatives of educational institutions offering different 
types of hygiene courses, with the request that they report 
briefly regarding these courses and the results obtained from 
giving them. 
A. Freshman Hygzene 
PRELIMINARY GRouP DiscussION 
Mr. Black, Chairman 
This discussion of this topic was begun near the end of a 
group meeting and carried over to the second day. All the 
discussion pertaining to this topic has here been put to- 
gether as if continuous, as practically it was. 
The questions suggested by the Chairman for discussion 
were these: 
(a) Shall there be a freshman hygiene course? 
(b) If so, shall it be a part of the student health service related 
to the needs of individual students? 
(c) Shall it be a required course? 
(d) Shall credit be given for it, and how much? 
(e) What methods of teaching shall be used?

Motivation 178 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
The Chairman asked Dr. Bessie Noyes, Assistant Pro- 
fessor of Hygiene, North Carolina College for Women, 
Greensboro, North Carolina, to describe the course in 
FRESHMAN HycIENE AT NorTH CAROLINA COLLEGE 
FOR WoMEN 
Dr. Noyes: 
While we are not primarily training teachers, a great 
many of our students go into teaching in rural schools, 
elementary schools and high schools. Our freshman 
course in hygiene is a required course. I feel that it be- 
longs in the freshman year. We have no compulsory 
sciences of any sort, which means that a girl can go through 
college without taking chemistry, physics or biology. Fre- 
quently they come to us without having had science training 
of any sort. You can readily see our problem. One girl 
comes from a good high school, another from a rural school 
who has not had more than seven or even six years train- 
ing during her elementary years; yet these two girls are in 
the same class and we have to make a course that will ap- 
peal to them both and serve them both. Both of them will 
eventually have to take the same final examination. 
I am trying to work out something that will interest 
them. We try to find what they want most of all when they 
come to college. The first reaction is that they have come 
to get an education. If you keep after them you will find 
that that is not the thing they want most; the thing our 
girls want most is to be popular! I do not know whether 
that is the thing to start out with in a college girl’s course, 
but it is what we are doing. Wesay: ‘What are the es- 
sentials for popularity?” We find that people do not want 
cross folks coming around them; and that leads us into 
our mental hygiene program. People prefer friends around 
who are good looking; and that leads into the subject of 
personal cleanliness, care of the hair, skin, clothing, etc. 
Naturally we take up as much of physiology as seems to 
us necessary for getting over the points we are trying to 
make. 
Under the subject of personal cleanliness we take up the 
structure of the skin and of the hair. Later the discus- 
sion leads into the question of internal cleanliness, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
Health Education Curriculum 179 
that is a large field for discussion. We do not try to en- 
force anything that does not appeal. We try to find some- 
thing to which the students will respond readily and will- 
ingly. You can tell whether or not students are interested. 
Later in the year we have a woman physician give seven 
talks on sex hygiene, treating it in a fairly broad way. 
She takes up the structure of the organs involved and from 
that leads into a bit of community hygiene. As you may 
know, in our State a physical examination is required be- 
fore the issuing of a marriage certificate. We try to get 
our girls to see the importance of this and we try to shift 
from the personal to the community viewpoint. 
We talk somewhat about the laws in regard to the care 
and sale of milk in the State. When girls are absent on 
account of mumps, chickenpox, and other diseases, we use 
these absences as a basis for the discussion of contagious 
diseases, quarantine, public health inspection, etc. We try 
to discuss such subjects as will help the students to become 
better citizens. We shift the subjects somewhat from year 
to year. 
The amount of infirmary expense we have is not pro- 
portionally larger for the 1500 students we have at the 
present time, as compared with our 500 or 600 students 
four or five years ago. Our president feels that the work 
we are doing is worth while even from a financial 
standpoint. 
There was a request from the floor that Dr. Clarence D. 
Hart of Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York, describe 
the course he expects to give in Freshman Hygiene. 
Dr. Hart said that he has not yet begun this course but 
hopes to do so next year. Since Syracuse University has 
6,000 students, 1,600 of whom are freshmen, it is going to 
be a big problem io give a required course in hygiene to 
these freshmen. The University has established a student 
health service; but what its relation to the freshman hygiene 
course will be, he does not yet know. All freshmen are re- 
quired to report a week before entrance for examinations 
and next fall they will be given a ‘“‘yes-no” examination in 
hygiene; if they pass fairly well, they will be excused from 
taking the freshman hygiene course. Otherwise it will be 
required. The work will be on a credit basis with weekly Syracuse

classes. 
Hyciene Courses at Iowa STATE UNIVERSITY 
Dr. Griswold: 
Not all of our students go into teaching. We aim to give 
them a foundation for the understanding and practice of 
personal hygiene, and a foundation for teaching hygiene, 
if they go out to teach. 
However, we have no personal hygiene course for fresh- 
men, nor for sophomores. We teach them chemistry, 
physics, biology and the other fundamental sciences first. 
In the junior and senior years we teach from the profes- 
sional viewpoint. We train in the College of Liberal Arts, 
students who are going out as social workers into various 
fields where they will need a knowledge of hygiene. 
There are some advantages in teaching hygiene in the 
freshman year, one good reason being that when students 
come to us they are breaking away from their family ties 
and coming into a new environment. It is an excellent 
time to form new habits and practices. 
All of our hygiene courses are purely voluntary. I 
object to required courses. I think it is fundamental that 
a student should come in a proper frame of mind,—asking 
for information. 
We do not separate men and women in our hygiene 
classes; I would rather resign than do this. You get 
nowhere when you work with men and women separately; 
with both, you can develop a real course in social hygiene. , 
Dr. Tutyshkin: 
It is interesting—this program which you are discussing 
here. In Russia our teachers’ colleges have all this work 
based on health education principles. We begin health 
education in the first year. We have physics and chem- 
istry; then biology; then hygiene. Practically from the 
first we have physical training, not only in the gymnasium, 
but in personal life. We train our students from the first 
to establish health habits and apply health teaching in a
-P-A-G-E-189
Health Education Curriculum 181 
practical way. The theory of hygiene we give later in their 
training. 
The question of requiring freshman hygiene was dis- 
cussed, pro and con. 
Professor Turner: 
I would like to say something about the principle of re- 
quiring hygiene. I believe it is sound educational pro- 
cedure to insist that every student coming into a teacher 
training institution should have a program which will help 
to adapt that person to healthful living. An institution 
which does not do that is not requiring a kind of living it 
should for its students. For the last four years I have had 
college freshmen, and also medical students, at Tufts’ Col- 
lege. In this institution we had more trouble from the 
health viewpoint with the last year’s class of seniors than 
with the other three classes put together. The reason is 
that these seniors, when they were freshmen, were not re- 
quired to study hygiene, and when they became sophomores, 
the course was introduced as a required freshman course. 
It was very plain that the students who had taken the 
course in hygiene realized the value of right living. 
I am convinced also that to make health education a part 
of cultural life is sound procedure. In our teacher train- 
ing institutions we ought to go on that basis, aiming for 
personal health and for service in citizenship. The pro- 
gram of teacher training ought also to help the teacher to 
acquaint herself with the best methods of putting over 
health to her children. We ought, in our practice schools, 
to develop a teacher training-health education practice 
course in which teachers would have a chance to work out 
the principles. Every practice school ought to be an ideal 
demonstration of the extent to which the individual teacher 
can improve the health of the pupil by personal interest 
and endeavor. 
The Chairman called upon Mrs. Kathleen Wilkinson 
Wootten, Director of the Health Department, Georgia 
State College for Women, Milledgeville, Georgia, to outline 
the course that is given in The princi- 
ple of re-

Factors in 
success 
  182 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
FRESHMAN HYGIENE AT GEORGIA STATE COLLEGE 
FOR WOMEN 
Mrs. Wootten: 
It seems that we unanimously agree that the first health 
education problem to be solved in teacher training institu- 
tions is the safeguarding of the health of the student 
teacher. I think we also agree that this should be done, 
first, by a complete health examination of each individual 
student, with needed follow-up work; second, by a health- 
ful program of living; and third, by direct instruction in 
hygiene. This triple program for the protection and de- 
velopment of the health of the student teacher in the 
Georgia State College for Women has been in effect for a 
number of years. ‘The first direct instruction was given in 
1911 by the Physical Education Department. Since 1917 
a distinct and well equipped Department of Health has 
been in charge of health instruction. 
Any success we have had is due to many contributing 
factors. The first of these is the enthusiastic support of 
the college administration. The second factor that in- 
fluences and broadens the health vision of the student is 
the fact that our curriculum requires six points of college 
credits in applied domestic science, four points in applied 
biology, four points in applied chemistry, three in applied 
psychology, six points in applied health, and three hours 
of physical education, with varied additional outdoor 
activities each week during the entire college residence. 
The third contributing factor is the splendid spirit of 
cooperation that has been fostered by the college ad- 
ministration between all the different college depart- 
ments. 
The close correlation of subject matter in the entire group, 
particularly in biology, chemistry, and nutrition and health, 
is a fine expression of team work. This cooperation ex- 
tends to the fourth outstanding factor that helps to make 
health education function as a part of our teacher training 
program—namely, a practice school, where principal and 
critic teachers combine to make health instruction and 
health training paramount. In the practice school the 
students see and assist in applying health principles to the 
life needs of children in the grades.
-P-A-G-E-191
  Health Education Curriculum 183 
The six points of health required for all degrees and 
diplomas are as follows: 
Freshman year, three hours of applied personal hygiene. 
Sophomore year, three hours of health education for the 
grades. 
Besides these courses a wide list of health electives is 
open to students who wish to pursue this line of study. 
The interest of the students themselves is demonstrated 
by the fact that four-fifths of the senior class usually elect 
the child welfare course—a course in prenatal care, infant 
care and pre-school age care. This course (called ‘“‘mother- 
craft class” by the students) was required of all students 
from 1917 to 1919. Since then, health education for the 
grades has been substituted as the second year requirement 
in health. The continued election of this course certainly 
proves that young women are interested in this subject. 
Such is our general plan for health education. Now a 
few words as to our aims and the subject matter and 
methods used in our freshman course in personal hygiene. 
The chief objectives in this course are, first, to awaken the 
students to the need for good health, second, to stimulate 
their interest in their own health problems, and third, to 
offer opportunities for the development and checking of 
their mental, physical, spiritual, social and emotional be- 
havior. Special emphasis is given to the establishment of 
good habits in posture, movement, care of the body (in- 
ternal and external cleanliness), clothing, use of the speak- 
ing voice, self-control and cheerfulness. 
Since physiology is probably the worst taught subject 
in our elementary schools today, and some scientific knowl- 
edge of body functioning is necessary for a clear under- 
standing of fundamental personal health principles, the 
basic subject matter in this course is a working knowledge 
of physiology with its application to constructive personal 
hygiene. This subject matter is by no means a bone-dry 
text-book assignment and a discussion of physiology, but 
takes as its motivation the specific needs and interests of 
each class group. : 
One year the need for guidance in the matter of shoes 
was strikingly apparent; so the instructor introduced the 
subject with a large collection of correct and incorrect types 
of shoes and a set of posters on hygiene of the feet, and a Six points of 
health re- 
quired for a 
degree

demonstration of correct walking and of corrective exercises 
for the feet. The enthusiastic response from the students 
led to a detailed study of the function and hygiene of the 
skeleton. Anatomy models and charts, posters, blackboard 
drawings, outlines and demonstrations helped to clarify the 
students’ hazy ideas of this and other vital subjects in per- 
sonal hygiene. 
A series of lectures and practical demonstrations on first 
aid and home care of the sick is given toward the end of 
the course. Self-activity is encouraged by written reports, 
discussions of the required readings, class work, outdoor 
activities, “health diaries,’ posters, booklets, models for the 
annual health exhibit, and spirited debates. 
The texts used in this course are Williams’ Healthful 
Living, Fisher and Fisk’s How to Live, and the Red Cross 
First Aid Manual. We do not consider the course a per- 
fect one but it fits the needs of our students as they come 
to us from the high schools of our State. When these high 
schools develop health education courses, our “beginners 
course” will become more technical, but never so technical, 
we hope, that it will fail to fire the students with an en- 
thusiasm for happy, healthful living. 
Miss Abby Turner, Professor of Physiology at Mount 
Holyoke College: 
Our problem at Mount Holyoke is more what we expect 
to do with this work than what we have already done, be- 
cause we have tried various things and have given them up 
because we weren’t successful. The thing that we have 
done in the last few years is to plan a course in social 
hygiene; this is given to seniors. ‘This course has been ap- 
preciated by the seniors far more than any other course 
given on that subject. We have continued it for three 
years. 
Next year the whole thing is going to be changed. We 
will give a course in hygiene to the freshmen; a course in 
mental hygiene to the sophomores; and other courses to the 
juniors and seniors. I think cooperation between the de- 
partments is increasing rather than decreasing, but it is 
difficult to work out. This year in the freshman hygiene 
course I tried out an experiment to see how we could get 
some personal contacts with that group in a laboratory
-P-A-G-E-193
    
Health Education Curriculum 185 
demonstration. I felt that usually we just talked at the 
students and that they didn’t get much out of it. It is a 
terrific job.to take three hundred freshmen and run through 
a demonstration. I think, however, that our experiment 
was very successful. 
It was suggested that the group assume that some kind 
of health teaching should be given to student teachers in 
their first year in a teacher training institution; that in a 
majority of institutions this first health course is likely to 
be a course in hygiene. Dr. Andress and Professor Turner 
in particular were in favor of assuming that such a course 
should be given. Professor Turner thought the matter of 
prerequisites and subject matter could be discussed later. 
Miss Crowell expressed herself as very much in sympathy 
with the point of view that the freshman course should 
follow the evident needs of the students as these are found. 
This will start the students with an inquiring mind, which 
will be serviceable when they have biology. 
Chairman: 
In all the normal schools of Washington, credit for the 
first health education course is given on what is called a 
“plus credit basis,” i.e., it does not reduce the number of 
credits required for graduation. A basic number of credit 
hours is required for graduation, and a certain number in 
addition. At Ellensburg the curriculum is divided into 
three units of twelve weeks each, and their three health 
education courses give a student a total of nine credits. 
Dr. Iago Galdston, Secretary Health Speakers Service, 
New York Tuberculosis Association, related his experience 
with some courses of lectures on the public health aspects of 
personal hygiene given for about two years at the New York 
Pedagogical Institution. The consensus of opinion among 
those who had the work in charge was that the students 
failed to grasp the essential principles involved because of 
a lack of biological background. He continued: 
“Unless teachers in training possess a basic knowledge 
of biology, they are not able fully to understand the health 
subjects you teach them. You can teach a few things as in 
regard to digestion; but often they learn by rote, failing to Need of a

understand the subject fundamentally. Without a basic 
knowledge of biology, they cannot grasp fundamental prin- 
ciples or develop the necessary enthusiasm for hygiene. 
The understanding of food assimilation, respiration, and 
many vital subjects in personal hygiene, demands a knowl- 
edge of biology first. I do not mean descriptive biology. 
What I have in mind is rather the biovagy of function, the 
biology of cell life, tissues, organs and systems.” 
Miss Dudley said that the course in hygiene at the 
University of Chicago comes in the sophomore year. They 
want biology as a foundation, and that is given in the first 
year. 
Following this, a number of other contributions were 
given which were repeated substantially at the evening 
joint session, under which they will be found. 
From the discussion it appeared that teacher training 
institutions vary so greatly that no one freshman hygiene 
course would be suitable for all classes of institutions. 
When the time came for the meeting to adjourn, no 
definite conclusions had been reached for report to the joint 
session. It was suggested that some of the group might 
be able to remain with the Chairman to thresh out the ques- 
tion further. This was done. 
The meeting adjourned. 
Several members of the group remained to discuss the 
matter of different types of teacher training institutions. 
Miss Oppen suggested the use of the classification used 
by the American Association of Teachers Colleges, which 
recognizes four classes of institutions. This classification 
did not include the one year county normal school rep- 
resented at the conference by Miss Rood. This suggestion 
was informally approved to be presented for discussion at 
the evening meeting. 
Jotnr Discussion 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
At the Chairman’s request, Mr. Black summarized the 
morning’s discussion of freshman hygiene and offered for
-P-A-G-E-195
Health Education Curriculum 187 
approval the following classification of teacher training 
institutions: 
Class A: Institutions offering both graduate work and under- 
graduate work; which grant the higher degrees as well as the bache- 
lor’s degree for four years undergraduate work. Many of the 
institutions represented at this conference fell in this class. 
Class B: Institutions giving no graduate work, but granting the 
bachelor’s degree for four years’ undergraduate work. These in- 
stitutions train high school and elementary school teachers, and 
also many of our specialists, principals, and superintendents. 
Class C: Normal schools that offer a minimum course of two 
years, and a maximum of three or four years. 
Class D: Normal schools giving a straight two-year course and 
nothing beyond that. 
Mr. Black explained that this classification is the one used by 
the American Association of Teachers Colleges. This conference 
would need to add a fifth class. 
Class E: The Under-Privileged School. 
The requirement of one year leads to the granting of a certificate. 
This type of school, in some sections of the country, trains teachers 
for rural work. This type of training institution represents “the 
training of teachers in an under-privileged situation.” 
Mr. Black further stated that Professor Harold L. Lang, 
Professor of Biology and Public Health, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, represented an 
institution of Class A, and he could describe the 
HycIENE COURSES AT CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF 
TECHNOLOGY, PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA 
Professor Lang: 
We have four distinct courses, two for men, one for men 
and women, and one for women alone. We have a so- 
called “general course” with no prerequisites, given during 
the first year, the aim of which is to teach the student either 
to preserve the health which he or she already has, or to 
improve it. 
This course is really a general health program because 
it requires close connection with other activities. This 
program consists first of all in a physical examination of 
every student at entrance. Careful record is kept of de- 
fects. Students who need it are followed up and obliged 
to come in for later examinations. This results in a pro- Classifica-

gram of “corrective gym work” for improvement in posture, 
and of feet, etc. A program is worked out for those who 
show signs of malnutrition. Certain girls are required to 
take a glass of milk every morning between classes; others 
are required to take it both morning and afternoon, depend- 
ing on their condition. 
The school has a list of consulting specialists. Certain 
students are directed to oculists. A great many students 
have been found to have thyroid trouble and these are 
given special attention. A specialist in mental hygiene sees 
students who are sent to him. The entire program is 
closely correlated with the physical training work. Credit 
is given for a course in physical training and hygiene which 
includes one lecture per week throughout the year in per- 
sonal hygiene and two hours per week of physical training. 
The lectures in hygiene are given by the college physicians, 
a man lecturing to the men, and a woman physician to the 
women students. This course requires no prerequisites. 
Most students have had high school elementary physiology; 
and some have had chemistry. ‘This general course covers 
the hygiene of nutrition, exercise, clothing, rest, mental 
hygiene, and sex hygiene. 
We have also a professional course in health education 
and hygiene, given in the senior year to students who are 
going out to teach household economics or become social 
workers. The prerequisites are high school or freshman 
chemistry and sophomore general biology. In freshman 
chemistry, the illustrations are selected from the practical 
processes of every-day life and attention is given to hygiene. 
In general biology, required in the sophomore year, the 
subject matter is drawn from the plant and animal king- 
doms—unicellular animals and plants (including bacteria) 
and multicellular organisms with emphasis on nutrition, 
growth, and reproduction. This is a two-hour lecture and 
four-hour laboratory course. In teaching biology sufficient 
emphasis is not always laid upon physics and chemistry 
as applied to living matter. We therefore lay special 
emphasis on physics and chemistry as applied to life pro- 
cesses. We believe that the necessity for ventilation can 
hardly be understood without a knowledge of the physics 
and chemistry of respiration. Students should also know 
something about the physics and chemistry of nutrition.
-P-A-G-E-197
  
Health Education Curriculum 189 
It is possible to teach health by selecting the right kind of 
illustrations. A water filter can illustrate (for biology) 
the struggle for existence, by showing the reactions which 
take place in the filter; and you can hardly use this ex- 
ample without also teaching sanitation. 
Biology is followed by a course in physiology of the same 
length. The physiology course is built upon the course 
in biology, and emphasizes the human, rather than the 
anatomical side. We seize every opportunity to teach 
hygiene along with the principles of physiology. 
The professional health education course for seniors aims 
to supplement the student’s previous teaching and includes 
subjects I have not time to discuss. We aim to give some 
information concerning the germ theory, the spread and 
prevention of diseases, sanitation, diseases caused by 
deficiencies in diet, school hygiene, mental hygiene and 
social hygiene. We feel that these students need also to 
know methods of teaching sanitation and public health. 
Mr Black stated that the freshman hygiene at the State 
Normal School, Ellensburg, Washington, he believed to be 
suitable to institutions of classes B, C and D. He was 
asked to describe the courses in hygiene and made the fol- 
lowing statement: 
Mr. Black: 
Three required courses in health education are given at 
Ellensburg. One is a course in hygiene; one a short course 
in nutrition, and the third a course in biology. Some 
students start with biology, involving hygiene; some with 
hygiene, involving biology; some take both courses at the 
same time. ‘The teachers of both subjects are in close con- 
ference all the time. Time relationships seem to make 
little difference in the results. The students are required 
to have some acquaintance with the exact sciences when 
they enter. 
When the first course in hygiene is begun, the teachers 
are told: “If you come to the point where your pupils 
can’t understand your language, take time enough to see 
that they do.” That is not systematic but the school must 
face the situation just as it is. A teacher must have some 
freedom in selecting the topics to be emphasized. If fresh- Health edu- 
cation in in- 
stitutions of 
Classes B, C 
and D 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
190 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
man hygiene is begun without reference to biology, it has 
to be taught the best it can be taught under the circum- 
stances. If you had a required prerequisite course in 
biology, you would still get students who did not under- 
stand the teacher’s language. 
The course in applied biology is an attempt to lay a 
scientific foundation for hygiene. It is a short course on a 
credit basis of three hours. Descriptive biology is not so 
good a basis for hygiene as a course on the broader lines 
of biology, bacteriology, etc.

Miss Elma Rood, Director of Health Education, Mans- 
field Child Health Demonstration, representing the ‘‘under- 
privileged” class of teacher training institutions, gave the 
following outline of the hygiene work at Mansfield, Ohio. 
Tue HeattH EpucaTION Course In A County 
NorMAL SCHOOL 
  Miss Rood: 
Our course at Mansfield is really a freshman hygiene 
Health equ. COUtSe but has to take in personal hygiene, a review of 
catiin hygiene methods, and everything else that we give in health 
the under- teaching because it is the only chance we get at these people. 
peleeed I am in charge of a piece of experimental work. In 
connection with our work throughout the county, we have 
an opportunity to do some experimental work in the county 
normal school which trains students for the rural field. 
There are about fifty-two similar classes in Ohio, and very 
many others of the same kind throughout the country. 
The general aim of a teacher’s training course in any 
subject is to prepare the students to teach. What they will 
teach and how they will teach it must be a consideration 
throughout the entire course. It may be necessary, because 
of inadequate preliminary preparation, to spend a con- 
siderable amount of time on subject matter; but running 
parallel with this should go instruction in how to select 
material which is needed at various stages of a child’s de- 
velopment and then how to convey this to the child so as to 
obtain the maximum results in basic knowledge, skill, 
habits, attitudes, and appreciations which will daily in- 
fluence the child’s voluntary actions.
-P-A-G-E-199
Health Education Curriculum 191 
No hard and fast rules can be made regarding methods. 
They must be determined by the objectives. The method 
itself is of less importance than the personality and en- 
thusiasm of the teacher using it and the spirit which she 
puts into it. No two people are likely to use similar 
methods in teaching the same points. What may prove to 
be a very successful method with one teacher may be a 
miserable failure in the hands of another because of the 
lack of that intangible something which the first teacher 
fused into it. 
For instance, two teachers with rooms adjoining, tried to 
interest the children in eating the right foods. Both 
checked up the children in order to maintain the enthusiasm 
of the children. The first teacher had indifferent results. 
The second so inspired the children that mothers confided 
that they no longer had trouble in getting Susie and Howard 
to take milk and cereal in the morning, and that now 
they were both gaining. What was the difference? One 
teacher put herself into the game and played it just as hard 
as the children did. The other never got into the game 
herself, and so the children never passed the stage of 
mechanical checking as a device. 
In general, before deciding what special methods shall 
be used in any course, it is a wise procedure to take an 
inventory of the assets and liabilities of your class. This 
type of survey may be as simple or as elaborate as the 
teacher wishes. It should include such basic questions as 
the following: 
1. What preliminary training have the majority of the students 
had? 
2. What types of school have they attended,—first class high schools 
or schools lacking in essentials? 
. Did they have their elementary training in city, village or rural 
schools ? 
4. What was the character of the instruction given in this particu- 
lar subject? Was it principally memory work, or are there 
evidences in the daily habits of the students that some applica- 
tions are being made to every-day life? 
5. What previous experience have the students had with children? 
In summer courses we often find normal school students who 
have had several years of experience. Methods of presenta- 
tion in such a group will be considerably different from methods 
to be used with young people just out of high school. wW Objectives

methods 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
    192 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
First, take 6. What is the general attitude of the students toward questions of 
an inven- personal hygiene? If responsive and eager, the problem of the 
tory instructor will be immeasurably easier than if indifference or 
antagonism be present. 
7. For what particular field of teaching are the students to be 
prepared? In this day of specialization in educational fields 
this means that the instructor must know intimately the prob- 
lems of that particular field, so that she may make sure, when 
the students leave her class, they will be ready and eager to 
solve the problems that confront them on the first day of school. 
In a rural school a teacher may be required to conduct during 
a day: 
recitations in reading 
recitations in arithmetic 
recitations in language and grammar 
recitations in word study 
recitations in geography 
recitations in hygiene 
recitation in history 
recitation in civics 
recitation in agriculture 
writing class for all grades. 
Besides this, she must plan for the opening exercises and seat 
work; she must supervise recesses, relief drills, and the noon 
lunch, do janitor work and act as community leader. In addi- 
tion we want her to be responsible for the all-round develop- 
ment of each individual child (fifteen to forty of them—of all 
ages from six to sixteen). 
Obviously, every effort must be made to develop methods that 
shall meet, in a simple and practical way, and with the mini- 
mum of direction, the problems and needs of the field. 
8. What methods can be used most effectively, what methods will 
produce results, in the time allotted by the State to this sub- 
ject? Encroachment upon time apportioned to other studies is 
not looked upon with favor by school administrators. Careful 
planning must be done in order to keep within the schedule. 
9. What are the objectives to realize which is the final aim through- 
out the year? ‘These cannot be too clearly defined in the in- 
structor’s mind, since they will act as constant guides in her 
choice of methods. The methods in health education at Mans- 
field are strictly experimental, subject to change from year to 
year as we get favorable or unfavorable reactions from our 
students in the field, and as we learn to what degree our ob- 
jectives have been realized. 
For instance, some material presented by lecture method in the 
health education class appeared not to function when the stu- 
dents entered their own schools. What was the matter? 
Much of it went over their heads because it was not sufficiently 
simple, was never thoroughly understood, and therefore was 
not really accepted as a responsibility. Consequently, during mR rr DOM C0 0
-P-A-G-E-201
Health Education Curriculum 193 
this past year, lectures have been very largely replaced by simple 
explanations, class discussions, actual observation, and demon- 
strations with live children. We endeavor constantly to dem- 
onstrate in this class the methods we expect the students to use 
in their own classrooms. 
The objectives kept constantly in mind by instructor and 
students, which objectives have determined in large measure 
the devices and methods we used throughout the past year, 
are here stated: 
1. To train the prospective teacher to control, as far as possible, 
her own health; and to develop au enthusiasm for good health 
in herself, which she may later pass on to her pupils. 
2. To familiarize the students with the various health conditions, 
favorable and otherwise, which are to be found in every school- 
room; and from this knowledge to develop a sense of responsi- 
bility which every teacher should have for the welfare of the 
children in her care. 
3. To prepare the student to present the subject of health in such 
a way that good health habits will voluntarily function in the 
lives of pupils. 
4. To prepare the teacher to assist intelligently in bringing the 
health standard of her school and community up to its highest 
point. 
The special aims of the director, formulated because of 
the previous year’s experience, were these: 
1. To connect more closely the study of the students’ personal 
hygiene with the working out of the health program in the 
school. To stress more emphatically the various methods of 
teaching health at the time that each topic is being considered 
from the standpoint of subject matter. 
2. To encourage the students to practice daily the health rules in 
so far as it is possible under existing living conditions. 
3. To build up a cooperative relationship between the rural field 
workers in health and the prospective teacher in rural fields. 
Among our various experimental methods, certain ones 
have brought more favorable responses from the class than 
others. All have been developed with the rural field and 
its problem in mind. ‘These methods are not presented as 
finished products, since the final test of any method can- 
not be made on the basis of temporary interest aroused. 
The final judgment may only be made when the teacher 
voluntarily puts into action the matter taught. If com- 
pulsory measures had to be used, or pressure brought to Objectives

bear in order to bring these results, we have acknowledged 
the failure of the method. Only the development of an 
underlying spirit can be considered the final test of its 
SUCCESS. 
The visual material which I have brought with me was 
not specially prepared for this meeting but was taken from 
the actual classroom equipment for health education, and 
was used during the past year. 
I shall speak of methods in the following order: 
1. Those which involve principally the normal school 
students themselves. 
2. Those which involve some child activity or have to 
do with some phase of child study. 
3. Those which involve field problems. 
4. Those which bring in the use of inanimate material 
as aids to lesson developments. 
1. MerHops WuicH INVOLVE PRINCIPALLY THE NORMAL SCHOOL 
(a) 
(b) STUDENTS THEMSELVES. 
In September, 1923, our students assisted in organizing 
and conducting two competitive health pageants at the 
county fair, involving 500 rural children. Every stu- 
dent responded and efficiently carried the part assigned 
to him. Many of the students were amazed to find 
out the complete organization that is necessary for 
handling successfully large groups of children unac- 
customed to a dramatic performance. All were im- 
pressed with the value of group presentation of health 
subjects as a means of community education. 
The members of the class prepared weight graphs of 
their own class, just as they might prepare them for 
their schools. 
(c) Under the direction of the nutrition specialist, the class 
was organized for a “hot lunch project” to extend 
throughout the year. This was carried out with a very 
modest equipment. Committees were appointed, 
budgets were figured and all procedures carried on as 
they would be in a rural school organization. This 
provided not only invaluable experience in food selec- 
tion and preparation, but the lunch itself increased the 
students’ working energy, strengthened their personal- 
ities, improved their appearance and demonstrated to 
the group the tremendous value of hot noon lunches for 
school children. 
(d) Dramatizing procedures with students as actors. This
-P-A-G-E-203
  Health Education Curriculum 195 
method is effective in developing enthusiasm and in- 
terest. In taking up the subject of the control of com- Methods in- 
municable diseases, the class took the part of pupils Volving the 
of a rural school who were being rapidly inspected for prudent 
contagion. In order to give the class a clear idea of 
the machinery set in motion by the teacher when she 
sends a child home for suspected contagion, the entire 
process was dramatized, the play bringing in the sick 
child, the rural teacher, the public health nurse, the 
brother of the sick child, the mother, the family physi- 
cian and the county health officer. No teacher could 
fail to see her responsibility and to realize the possible 
outcome in an entire community if she failed to do her 
part. 
The same method was used in the subject of health ex- 
aminations. After all students had been examined, 
they studied their own cards to see what points needed 
emphasis during the year. In order to tie this proced- 
ure up closely to the problem of the child, the room 
was equipped as for a rural health examination. The 
doctor, assisted by a rural nurse, examined a number 
of children in the presence of their mothers. These 
were real examinations and not staged for the occasion. 
Students were present as spectators, listening to the 
running comments of the doctor and the responses of 
the mothers. All the lecturing in the world cannot 
take the place of actual personal experience strength- 
ened by watching the experience of others. 
In taking up the subject of accident prevention and 
first aid, constant use was made of the dramatic appeal. 
Resuscitation involved a heroic rescue on the beach 
with a blanket on the floor for sand and a succession 
of students from the class representing victims. Every 
member served both as victim and as rescuer, in order 
to better understand from experience the principles 
of the Schaeffer method. In bandaging, a contest was 
staged as it might be worked out in the upper grades 
of any school. This contest was then used as one 
phase of an entertainment for this class and the class 
of the previous year. This reunion proved invaluable 
in developing an esprit de corps in the group as a whole. 
(e) A class project in research was carried on for six weeks 
during the fall, the aim being to find all available 
reference material in the Mansfield Library on health 
subjects appearing in the course. Each student chose 
one subject for research and the findings of the whole 
class were compiled for use in class assignments. 
(f) Regular individual conferences with students regarding 
their personal hygiene problems often brought questions
-P-A-G-E-204

ity

(g) 
(h) and discussions regarding the children in the practice 
groups. This showed an awakening interest in the de- 
velopment of the child. 
Demonstration lessons, using the class to represent chil- 
dren of any age, were effective in bringing typical 
children’s responses from the class members. The les- 
sons were taught by the instructor or by a class member. 
The class might represent a first grade reading class, 
an eighth grade hygiene class, or an entire rural school; 
and they acted a story play as a rest exercise. Material 
prepared by a student teaching the class was placed in 
her collection for use in her own school next year. 
Constant efforts were made to closely correlate pedagogy, 
child psychology and general methods, in order to dem- 
onstrate that good methods which apply to the teaching 
of history, geography and English, also apply to the 
teaching of health. Teaching by example is by far the 
best method and the one most likely to be followed. 
2. MetHops WHicH INvoLvE SomE Cuitp Activity or HAVE 
(a) 
(b) to Do WitH SoME PHASE oF CHILD Stupy. 
Children were frequently brought in to illustrate points 
previously explained. To develop the idea of the nor- 
mal healthy child, the class discussed the points which 
they felt to be characteristic of normal and healthy 
people in general. A group of children, representing 
various degrees of physical development, were then 
brought before the class and given a series of simple 
tests involving both physical and mental activity. 
While this game was going on, the class members were 
making observations on physical development, appear- 
ance of being underweight, brightness of eyes, expres- 
sion, responsiveness, evidences of outstanding personality 
traits, development of leadership, etc. 
After the games were over the children returned to their 
rooms and the class discussed their respective find- 
ings. When necessary, the health examination cards 
were consulted to ascertain the real conditions as com- 
pared with the observations. As the children always 
considered these exercises as games, they were eager to 
come. Even when the points to be observed were de- 
partures from the normal, no child knew this; and never, 
under any consideration, was a child discussed in his 
presence. 
In a similar way children were brought in to demon- 
strate correlations of health with story-telling, reading, 
story plays, singing and drills (such as handkerchief 
and tooth brush drills). 
The entire normal school was taken into a classroom to
-P-A-G-E-205
    
Health Education Curriculum 197 
observe a demonstration lesson as a basis for future dis- 
cussion. The lesson observed might be chosen for its 
direct health teaching or for its correlations. In all 
demonstrations with children, we make an effort to have 
the teachers realize that children are something more 
than receptacles for the three R’s, and that in the hours 
a child spends in school the teacher is responsible to see 
that his physical and mental environment and activities 
are such as to allow a full development of brain, body 
and spirit. 
(c) Constant practice work in all branches is afforded in 
the elementary schools throughout the year, and oppor- 
tunity is afforded the students for observation of points 
brought out in the health class. Members of the class 
have frequently brought to the attention of the director 
cases of children who, in her opinion, need attention to 
some physical defect. The health examination card 
often verifies the student’s observation. Organized prac- 
tice work in health was carried for a month in one 
particular building by members of the class. The les- 
sons were prepared by the students, discussed with the 
director, taught under supervision, and followed by per- 
sonal criticism. 
3. MetHops WHIcH BRING FIELD PROBLEMS AND WoRK INTO 
THE CLASSROOM, OR WHICH TAKE CLASS MEMBERS INTO THE 
Fre.p ITSELF. 
(a) Field visits made throughout the year by the health edu- 
cation director and by the public health nurses on the 
staff disclose conditions which intimately affect the work Field prob- 
of the rural teacher. These are formulated as problems lems 
and are brought into the classroom for joint discussion 
by the students and the nurses. The regular attendance 
and participation of the nurses has brought about a more 
thorough discussion than would be possible from one 
angle alone. It has developed a feeling of interdepend- 
ence and a wholesome regard for each other’s work that 
is already meaning much to the schools. 
A situation involving the falling of a gasoline lamp 
from the ceiling (which occurred in a rural school dur- 
ing a community program) furnished material for a dis- 
cussion of accident and fire prevention, focusing upon 
the responsibility of the teacher. 
Other problems which brought varied reactions from 
both normal school students and nurses were: 
(1) A young man took charge of a rural school last 
September. The school was found to be in poor 
condition. A meeting of the parents was called 
with the result that the school was given a thorough

cleaning. One mother laundered the curtains; a 
door mat was secured; the walls were freshly kal- 
somined; attractive pictures and children’s work 
was displayed; the common-pail-and-dipper gave 
way to a covered pail, a dipper and individual 
cups. The children were trained to use the cups 
properly, to clean their shoes at the entrance door 
and to be responsible for the care of their own 
desks and aisles. The school was transformed. 
Across the road from the school, lives a prominent, 
influential farmer. The barnyard adjoins the 
school yard. In the spring the barnyard was not 
cleaned and flies swarmed into the schoolroom. 
What do you think the teacher should do? 
(2) This school is taught by a teacher who has been 
in the county several years. The children come 
from prosperous homes and are clean and orderly. 
The interior of the school shows no evidence of 
cleaning for several years. Cobwebs, soot and 
dust are everywhere. A year ago a bubbling foun- 
tain was bought for the school. This has been 
put away in the corner, and the children are 
using a common cup and pail. When questioned 
about the sanitary fountain, the teacher said it 
had not been cleaned for ever so long and was not 
fit for use. What do you think of this situation? 
The positive, as well as the negative side, was 
shown in the problems presented. The stimula- 
tion of thought brought about by the discussion 
of such problems cannot help but bring some 
noticeable changes in conditions that now exist in 
many one-room schools. 
(b) Reports of work accomplished in rural schools are 
(c) brought into the classroom and posted, so that the stu- 
dents may study them. Four distinct interests, on the 
part of the class, were made evident by this exhibition: 
First, a desire to see what is being done in their home 
district; second, a desire to know the condition in the 
school in which the student will teach next year; third, 
a desire to see what is being done by teachers who are 
their friends; fourth, a wish to see what is being done by 
teachers who have earned a reputation for excellent work 
in the county. 
Charts developed by teachers in the field in carrying 
out some particular phase of health work are brought 
into the classroom and their uses discussed. A large 
“Go to sleep” chart and one developed during a milk 
drive were posted for a time, after which the class 
visited the school in which the work had been developed. 
(d) Children’s classroom work (not exhibit work) was

brought to the normal school and the students were 
given an opportunity to take notes, ask questions and 
discuss the work shown. 
Once a year the students go into the rural schools for 
observation and practice and remain for one week. 
Definite points for study are given them in connection 
with health work. Upon their return from the country, 
the entire class period is thrown open for discussion 
of their findings. These discussions show a very dis- 
tinct reaction to points discussed in the classroom. 
This field experience is invaluable and will be greatly 
increased next year with the establishment of a rural 
demonstration school in the county. 
The class attended several rural community. meetings, 
twice contributing to the program. This gave them 
first-hand contact with the teacher as a rural leader 
and visions of what they themslves might accomplish. 
next year. 
Outside speakers interested in all phases of educational 
work were brought to the class. Contacts have thus 
been made with leaders in the development of health 
work in the United States and abroad, which contacts 
have had a good effect on the development of attitudes~ 
and appreciation.

(a) 
(b) For the teacher in the one-room school elaborate equip- 
ment or expensive devices are out of the question. 
It was therefore necessary to develop and use in the 
class simple things that every teacher can obtain. Pic- 
tures have been found to be invaluable. They have 
been used for a variety of purposes—for illustrating 
points in lessons, silent reading, language exercises, 
health books, slogan contests, picture talks, poster con- 
struction and bulletin boards. The result of the con- 
stant use of this material by the instructor has been that 
every member of this year’s class is leaving with a 
well filled portfolio containing selected pictures ready 
for use next year. The making of this collection was 
entirely voluntary on their part. 
Other visual devices found valuable this year included 
a paper model for tooth brush drills, a dog’s head, a 
cat’s jaw, a set of horse’s teeth brought in by one of 
the boys, a brcomstick, a rope, an electric wire, a 
rubber mat from an automobile, teeth donated by a 
local dentist, magnifying glasses, an empty bottle and 
cork and the “muscle tester.” These and others have 
been used in the class itself with explanations of their

use with children. Material exhibited at the last 
teachers’ institute has also been demonstrated during 
the year. The value of these methods cannot as yet 
be determined. We hope by this time next year to be 
able to say which ones are influencing the lives of our 
tural boys and girls. That alone will determine their 
value. 
The discussion of freshman hygiene closed at this point. 
B. What shall be Required in Addition to Per- 
sonal Health? 
PRELIMINARY Discussion By TEACHER-TRAINING 
SECTION 
Mr. George H. Black, Chairman 
Chairman: 
UR subject this morning might be phrased: How to 
create a practical correlation of departments in 
universities, teachers’ colleges and normal schools, in 
order to: 
(a) Present adequate subject matter as a background 
for health teaching; 
(b) Apply the best methods now known in education 
to the teaching of health. 
I have asked Dr. Andress to introduce the subject for 
discussion and to say something about his method of teach- 
ing mental hygiene. 
Dr, Andress: 
As I look back over the last five years and recall the 
various forces that have been at work in education it seems 
to me that one of the most stimulating, original and prac- 
tical tendencies has been the health movement. I count it 
a privilege to have been associated in these years with 
people who have been dominated by such practical idealism. 
This conference is another indication of the insight and 
vision presented to us by the Health Education Division of 
the American Child Health Association under the able 
leadership of Miss Sally Lucas Jean. 
We have reached the place in this movement where the
-P-A-G-E-209
  
Health Education Curriculum 201 
greatest advancement is to be made by emphasizing the 
training of teachers. If the great army of school teachers 
in America can catch the vision of a new type of healthy 
human being, and can be put in possession of the proper 
working tools, the future of health education is secure. 
The first requisite in the training of teachers is a clear- 
cut conception of the ultimate goal toward which we are 
striving. What do we mean by this new type of healthy 
human being? I must confess to a little impatience with 
those health meetings that always begin and end with a 
consideration of such topics as malnutrition, physical de- 
fects, drinking milk, eating green vegetables, etc. In the 
light of all the facts that we now know about health how 
shall we define a healthy human being? Let us attempt 
some sort of a definition in terms of adjustment. A 
healthy person is one who meets the problems of life with 
a fair degree of success and with a minimum of strain. 
This means that an individual who meets situations like the 
taking of food, getting sleep, associating with others, ac- 
cepting criticism and meeting the facts of life squarely, are 
healthy. The healthy person is one who is so constituted 
physically and mentally that he is successful. This re- 
quires a good physical body and a mind that functions 
successfully in life adjustments. 
As we all know, there is a striking correlation between 
mental and physical functions, and much that we have 
thought of as physical is mental in origin. As a concrete 
illustration, let us consider the valuable mental habit of 
facing reality fairly and squarely. We may understand 
its importance through failure. Suppose we take for con- 
sideration a hypothetical individual, but one whose career 
is reflected hundreds of times in our psychopathic hospitals 
or in life’s shipwrecks, whom we will call “K.” As an 
infant K cried frequently. He was too cold, or too hot, 
or was pricked by a pin. And when he cried somebody 
came and ministered to him, and the discomfort disap- 
peared. ‘This process is meeting reality indirectly. It was 
the only thing he could do under the circumstances. But 
if crying in every case is satisfied, and a child gets what 
he cries for, a vicious habit is likely to be established. In- 
stead of getting anything directly, he cries for it. 
As K grew older, he found other indirect ways of gain- What is a 
healthy hu- 
man being?

ments to en-

ing his ends. One day when faced with a disagreeable 
situation he fell into a tantrum. His parents were fright- 
ened and allowed him to have his own way. At breakfast 
time he did not care to eat his oatmeal and under the stress 
of being persuaded his vomiting reflex was touched off. 
That proved to be a satisfactory procedure and thereafter 
he might vomit, not only when called upon to eat oatmeal, 
but when obliged to face any kind of disagreeable situation. 
Perhaps he refused to sleep until one of his parents went 
with him. And so all of these tendencies—crying, tan- 
trums, vomiting, etc——became ingrained in his nervous 
system by repetition and successful outcomes. K became a 
spoiled child and ruled the household like a tyrant. He 
is regarded as a “‘nervous” child. 
When K goes to school one of two things may happen. 
He may find that tantrums and vomiting (habits formed 
for the most part unconsciously) will not work. He may 
now learn at school to meet reality squarely. He will 
probably still try to get his ends through his usual methods. 
(He knows how to use those methods—and he has no other 
methods ready for use.) These methods may work in part, 
and he may finally get through school, although with some 
difficulty. If he goes on with these bad habits, he is ill 
prepared to face life, and in the crises which follow he is 
likely to resort to a neurosis to avoid facing reality. He 
may have a “nervous breakdown.” 
Although K may be in good condition physically, at any 
point in his career, he is obviously far from being a healthy 
individual. Yet few if any of the causes of his ill health 
were in the realm of physical hygiene. Drinking a quart 
of milk a day, eating green vegetables and following the 
various rules of the health game could not be depended 
upon to give relief. K’s restoration to health depends upon 
reeducation in fundamental mental health habits. His 
trouble is a functional nervous disorder. 
My plea, then, is for a thorough course in mental hygiene 
for our prospective teachers and for those in service. This 
course should be regarded as just as important as home 
economics, physical education and other subjects now re- 
garded as essential. Until we do this our training in 
health education will be incomplete; for the fattening of 
children to bring them up to weight, training them in

matters of posture, removing their physical defects and, in 
fact, the perfect physical development of the individual do 
not mean the attainment of our goals. Happiness and 
contentment have other foundations besides the physical. 
Happiness is a mental thing connoting self-realization in 
adjustment. ‘Training in mental hygiene is a necessity for 
teachers, if we are to consider health, in a broad way, as Teacher’s 
need of men- 
tal hygiene 
training 
adjustment—a word, borrowed from biology, which has | 
become meaningful in modern education. 
As to the concrete methods to be applied in health teach- 
ing in our teacher training institutions we must go to the 
general field of education for help. Our principles will be 
derived from modern educational psychology and methods 
of teaching which have proved successful. I would like to 
confine myself briefly to one aspect of method. It is a 
tendency in American education of which we may justly 
feel proud, and may be called the dynamic aspect of educa- 
tion. It stands out in contrast to the old method of 
memorizing. We have come to believe that in order to 
really learn we must do something else besides coming in 
contact with words and repeating them; we need to come 
into vital contact with things and activities themselves. 
When you look at the various kinds of material assembled 
in these rooms, you have evidence that something of this 
sort has been taking place in the lives of children who have 
been taught. If our methods are dynamic in character we 
shall bring pupil teachers into contact with actual health 
work in the field, suggest practical problems to be worked 
out and, in fact, immerse them in health education 
activities. 
It seems highly desirable that we should train students 
specifically for the thing they are likely to teach and do. 
My point of view can best be explained by referring to some 
of my own courses in health. I have one class composed 
of teachers in service. They come from various grades 
and are seeking help in educational methods which they 
can apply to their own pupils. Each teacher will have a 
little different situation to face. Iam planning to get each 
teacher to consider what she is doing, and in the light of 
that to plan her class work in health. Experiments in 
health teaching will accompany the work of the course. 
One requirement of the course is that each teacher shall
-P-A-G-E-212
  
  Boston Uni- 
versity 204 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
present a paper which will describe the children in her 
room, the demands made by the course of study, the pupils’ 
special needs, the kind of literature which might be placed 
in their hands with profit, the methods and devices to be 
employed, and the general ground to be covered. This 
paper will be returned to her as a working plan for the 
months of the year that follow. 
Another group I shall have next year is an undergraduate 
class from the Boston University School of Education. It 
will be harder to make their work dynamic; but I plan to 
have each one make a first-hand study of some school in 
Greater Boston, in which they will consider the physical 
equipment of the school, and the work of the school 
physician, school nurse, physical education teacher, home 
economics teacher, other special health teachers and the 
regular classroom teachers. ‘They will be expected to find 
out all they can about the physical condition of the chil- 
dren, and how successfully their health is being improved. 
In the light of the course they will be expected to make out 
a plan showing what changes might reasonably be made, 
at moderate expense, for improving the health of the chil- 
dren in that particular school. This training should 
result in a knowledge of some actual school conditions and 
in constructive and concrete thinking. 
I have another group of girls in the Boston School of 
Physical Education. They are taking a course in psy- 
chology as applied to health. These girls have their train- 
ing in physiology, anatomy, public health and health 
courses relating especially to physical education. My 
problem is to give them an idea of the human mind— 
how it works and how it ought to work—in this health 
problem. We take up mental hygiene and methods of 
teaching. Most of these girls will not teach health 
in regular classrooms but in some cases will be super- 
visors. 
People are looking at physical education with a new 
viewpoint. The old point of view was that about all you 
needed to do in order to be healthy was to use your muscles 
properly. That is a narrow conception and we are getting 
away from it. One interesting thing in this course was a 
project which was carried on for about two months.
-P-A-G-E-213
  
Health Education Curriculum 205 
After our study of the psychology of learning (including 
the nature and value of projects) I informed the class that 
I would turn over to them the question of health education 
completely. The girls appointed a “general steering com- 
mittee” which in turn appointed subcommittees. They in- 
vited different health education experts in the city of 
Boston to speak to them; reported on health work observed 
in the schools and on books and articles read; and gave 
concrete illustrations of methods successfully used in the 
school room. At the end of each hour I was given op- 
portunity to criticize and make general suggestions. At 
the end of the two months the class gave a health show in 
the gymnasium. Health foods were sold at booths and 
everybody was invited to buy supper. Later they wrote 
and produced a health play. 
In retrospect, I see the shortcomings of this course; there 
were gaps needing to be filled; yet I feel that the girls got 
an interest in health teaching which they might not have 
gained in any other way. We think too much of the 
particular kind of work a pupil turns out. If it is crude, 
we are likely to condemn it as superficial; yet there is some- 
thing more important than academic work, and that is the 
pupil’s insight and attitudes. These things should count 
heavily. 
Idealism is a practical necessity in life. A woman wash- 
ing dishes three times a day gets very weary of it; but if she 
can see it in relation to the care of her children and the 
blessings of home, even dish-washing may not only be 
tolerated but may be interesting. The same thing is true 
of much of our health work. Health activities in them- 
selves are about the most uninteresting things in the world: 
cleaning the teeth, taking care of the nose, cleaning the 
finger nails—any of these, apart from idealism, may be 
disgusting; but if seen as a part of an enticing adventure 
in producing healthier, happier human beings, then ideal- 
ism will have accomplished its mission.

I want to ask Dr. Howe if he will continue the discussion.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS AND SUPERVISORS IN 
WELLESLEY COLLEGE 
Dr. Howe: 
In introducing a description of the teacher training work 
of the Department of Hygiene and Physical Education of 
Wellesley College, may I call attention first to the pioneer 
activity of two of the department’s one-time teachers, Pro- 
fessor William T. Sedgwick and Professor Theodore 
Hough. They both saw clearly the part which the teacher 
of physical education could and should play in the teaching 
of hygiene and were the authors of a text which marked a 
new era in scientific thoroughness and caution in the teach- 
ing of hygiene in secondary schools and colleges. Over 
twenty years ago Professor Hough wrote, “The teacher of 
physical education stands in the most obvious relation to 
the cultivation of sound health, and this is understood by 
every boy and girl. . . . Would not the influence of in- 
struction be immensely augmented if instructors in physical 
education had formal charge of all instruction in personal 
hygiene?” 
Beside the usual qualification for the motor side of 
physical education, applicants for admission to the de- 
partment must come with a bachelor’s degree from an ap- 
proved college or university. Their undergraduate work 
must have included courses in psychology, education and 
the physical sciences. 
The courses in the department fundamental to, or bear- 
ing directly upon, the training for health work in the school 
are: 
1. Anatomy, histology, and general physiology. (Four 
and one-half hours. ) 
2. Applied physiology. (Three hours.) 
3. Health problems of school and community. (Three 
hours. Elective, but taken by a majority of 
students. ) 
4. Applied hygiene and corrective exercises. (Four 
hours. ) 
5. Symptomatology and emergencies. (One-half hour.) 
6. Play, playgrounds and athletics. (Two hours.) 
The course in applied physiology takes up advanced 
problems of human physiology and their application in
-P-A-G-E-215

personal hygiene and physical education. In nutrition, 
each student has entire charge of a control and an experi- 
mental animal for dietary studies. Students carry out 
upon themselves experiments involving gain and loss in 
weight and variations in endurance on different diets. 
Each student makes urinalyses; also, determinations of ni- 
trogen output, basal metabolism, and energy expenditure 
during different forms of activity. Body-weight prediction 
methods are studied, with computations based on actual 
measurements. Respiration, circulation, and neuromuscu- 
lar activity are covered and tests of organic and neuromus- 
cular fitness made. 
The course in health problems in the school and com- 
munity has three aims: (1) to fit the student to make her 
contribution to the teaching of hygiene in close linkage with 
the work in physical education; (2) to give her a detailed 
background-knowledge of prophylactic and remedial activ- 
ities which must be correlated with the teaching of hygiene 
in a complete school program; (3) to give her a general 
background of the public health problems of the community 
as a whole. Some of the topics of laboratory and field 
study are as follows: 
a. Ventilation. Visits to commercial, college and school build- 
ings, which have different forms of ventilating equipment, 
and to open-air schools. Tests made by each student with 
psychrometer, katathermometer, comfortmeter, etc. 
b. Illumination. Surveys of buildings exemplifying correct and 
incorrect, natural and artificial lighting. Use of the illu- 
minometer. Tests of vision. 
c: School architecture, equipment, and orientation. Town plan- 
ning in relation to schools. Surveys of local conditions. 
d. Bathing. Visits to pools and showers and examination of 
pool water. 
e. Nutrition. Visits to school lunch establishments of large city 
and small town. 
f. Clinics. Observations of clinics in Boston and Wellesley. - 
Talk and demonstrations by the local school nurse. 
g. Teaching of personal hygiene. Practice in methods; consid- 
eration of cooperation between school nurse and physical edu- 
cation practice work. 
h. Growth. Laboratory work in the course in applied physi- 
ology. 
i, Public health problems. Observation of water purification, 
sewage disposal, milk handling, production and preservation 
of foods, State, town and city laboratories, factory sanitary Laboratory

publications of semi-official agencies. 
The course in applied physiology and the course in health 
problems may count toward the M. A. degree of Wellesley 
College. 
The course in applied hygiene and corrective exercise is 
as follows: 
1. (a) Pre-pathological conditions (first semester): 
causes and recognition of faulty statics of the body, and of 
digestive, menstrual, and circulatory disorders. Remedial 
application of exercise, massage, diet, rest, clothing, sup- 
port, mental hygiene, regulation of environment. (b) 
Pathological conditions (second semester): scoliosis, paral- 
yses, arthritis, joint injuries. Twenty lectures by ortho- 
pedic and medical specialists; clinical demonstration at 
Carney Hospital, Boston. 
2. Preparation for supervised practice. Individual 
cases studied ; individual programs of exercises and regimen 
planned and supervised; records of progress kept of public 
school pupils and college students. 
These courses which attempt to give concrete, first-hand 
knowledge of related anti-hygienic factors causing ill 
health emphasize the education of the individual to higher 
levels of health. 
The course in play takes up problems of hygiene teach- 
ing from the physical education angle, and discusses physi- 
cal education material (play activities, self-testing activi- 
ties, gymnastics, dancing) as subject matter and incentive 
for health teaching. 
The courses in symptomatology and emergencies need no 
amplification. 
To summarize thus far, the work of preparing teachers 
of physical education to do their part in the teaching of hy- 
giene is based on a preparation in the physical and biologi- 
cal sciences, in psychology, and in education. It comprises 
a study of school and community health problems. In the 
practice work in hygiene and physical education there is 
joint supervision by faculty members interested in various 
aspects of the work. 
May I add some points representing my personal views:
-P-A-G-E-217
Health Education Curriculum 209 
. The subject of methodology in the teaching of personal 
hygiene is at the present time in a stage of inflation. This 
has some publicity value but will naturally and surely be fol- 
lowed by simplification and deflation. 
. Can we get really good teaching in any quantity, and per- 
manent interest proceeding from inner intellectual sources, so 
long as we recommend so much reliance on devices? 
. The verbal subject matter in much of the new literature that 
comes to my attention is far below the standard that the 
schools should allow. There is need of immediate revision 
and wholesale excision. Why inflict on a child doggerel and 
inane prose, when he could appreciate the music of the 
diction of De La Mare, a Lewis Carroll, a Tennyson, and a 
Kingsley? 
. Terminology. Personally I think there is no such thing as 
“health education,” there is only education. Through educa- 
tion we try to make clear the way for the child’s normal 
growth. We do this by putting him into an environment 
where he can get information and be guided in his activities. 
For convenience we classify the information and the activities 
as mathematics, composition, geography, hygiene, dancing, 
games, gymnastics. In hygiene as in other subjects our teach- 
ing methods are far removed from the perfunctory recitation 
of other days. Why, then, health education, any more than 
geography education, historical education, or, for that matter, 
physical education? I would suggest (if hygiene will not do) 
eusomatics as the third corner of the triangle, euthenics, eu- 
genics, and eusomatics. 
. Physical education and hygiene are not identical in aim; they 
are different aspects of the problem of education. In other 
words, health is not the sole aim in physical education. 
. The theoretical courses in normal training should be heavily 
stressed. Nothing in the world is so truly practical in the long 
run, as sound theory. A strong theoretical training is the 
foundation for personal growth while training that is only 
“practical,” in the ordinary use of that term, leaves the stu- 
dent only empirical methods to go on. 
. The academic standards in the scientific content of hygiene 
and sanitation should not be neglected. The academic sub- 
jects have a dignity and inherent value that is eminently 
well worth preserving, and which is sacrificed if there is too 
great insistence on immediate application. 
. Health standards are not best maintained by paternalistic 
surveillance and coercion. The opportunity for personal de- 
cision should not be sacrificed. 
. Emulation, pride, joy in muscular prowess and team solidarity 
constitute a major motive, in the child’s mind, for healthy 
living. Hygienic instruction should take an inconspicuous 
and natural place behind the activity motive. Beware of too 
much “safety first” emphasis in health as an end in itself.

10. Nutrition and the regulation of activity are our most impor- 
tant problems in personal hygiene under modern conditions. 
The first is being handled in the schools with increasing 
effectiveness under the stimulation of such organizations as 
the American Child Health Association. The second is the 
fundamental basis of a sound program of personal hygiene, 
and its successful solution, in the face of the conditions of 
our modern mechanical civilization, is of crucial importance. 
Discussion oF Dr. Hower’s Paper 
Miss Jean: 
I am glad to have the point brought out as to the sort of 
jargon sometimes used in health education literature. It 
is important for us to insist that health teaching shall not 
destroy one educational subject to build up another. We 
need to analyze the literature that now exists, giving credit 
to what is good, condemning what is bad. In talking the 
other day with one of the largest school book publishers in 
the country I learned that that company was willing to issue 
a new text written by a man trained twenty-five years ago 
and not considered by his friends to be a brilliant man at 
any time. Yet one of the largest publishing houses in 
America was willing to get out his book because his name 
is well known. We are responsible for this since so long 
as we are willing to buy the wrong kind of books, they will 
be published. The publishers will give us the kind of 
books we are willing to buy. 
Dr. Andress here arose to emphasize his plea for a 
broader and wider concept of health. 
Miss Dudley questioned Dr. Howe as to whether Wel- 
lesley College is not the only place that requires a bachelor’s 
degree for admission to the department of hygiene and 
physical education, and Dr. Howe replied that that was 
his belief. 
Miss Dudley: 
We all realize that the graduates of Wellesley are well 
equipped for health teaching. After years of experience 
some of us hold that the average person graduated from a 
physical education school has not the broad health training  
-P-A-G-E-219
  
Health Education Curriculum 211 
we would like him to have. I have always felt that a 
leader in physical education should be a leader in the health 
program. I have always been disappointed. For the sake 
of the average physical education teacher I hope you are 
not going to expect him or her to measure up to Dr. Howe’s 
standard. Yet I certainly would emphasize the value of 
having him or her reach that standard. 
Others expressed similar views. Miss Dudley added: 
“T wonder if it would not be quite in accord with the pur- 
pose of this conference to suggest to the physical education 
normal schools that they incorporate in their present sched- 
ule, courses which have to do directly with health education, 
to emphasize that more, and activity programs less.” 
Miss Jean suggested that a committee be appointed to 
consider health education in the program of schools of 
physical education. “I think,” she said, “it would be most 
gratifying to the American Child Health Association to 
have such a committee appointed in this room to assist with 
the plans for the future.” 
It was voted to form such a committee,* to cooperate 
with the American Child Health Association. 
Mrs. Wootten said conditions in the South are different 
from those in other parts of the country, and it would be 
many years before the South has the excellent courses which 
Dr. Howe suggests as absolutely necessary. She said that 
hundreds of teachers must be trained and must have put 
into their hands something practical that will aid them to 
help the children. 
Mr. Black brought out the difference between the “pri- 
vate institution’s privilege and right” and the “public insti- 
tution’s viewpoint.” He said that a well rounded health 
program should include both viewpoints. Many new 
movements have started in private institutions because pub- 
lic institutions are limited by regulations or by funds. In 
his own school, they are as free to work out policies as they 
would be in a private institution, but they don’t attempt to 
do certain types of work because of a lack of funds.

Dr. Howe, saying that he appreciated these situations, 
wished, nevertheless, to remind them not to forget the value 
of activity. Some years ago he had called to the atten-

tance of the health program, and for ten years had been 
talking about their ignorance of health education.

Miss Anna E. Richardson, Dean of Home Economics, 
Iowa State College, Ames, Iowa: 
“Practical correlations” suggests that you wish me to dis- 
cuss this topic in concrete terms. To do this, I must draw 
upon my experience at Iowa State College. What follows, 
therefore, represents accomplishment in part, and for the 
rest, the aims and effort of those interested in health educa- 
tion at Ames. We have for the past year been studying the 
problem of how to get the Home Economics Division to 
best function in a college program of health education, and 
we are still struggling. We are not training health educa- 
tion teachers, but we are training home economics teachers, 
and as such we feel that we should be training some of the 
best health education teachers. 
We believe thoroughly in health education, and it is 
placed first in the statement of the three following aims 
which we hope to achieve through our home economics in- 
struction: The maintenance of health for every member 
of the family; the maintenance of sound economic stand- 
ards for the family; and the maintenance of fine social 
relationships between all members of the family. Such a 
statement of our aim—to send out our graduates with stand- 
ards of health and a knowledge of how to maintain them— 
is helpful because it is fairly concrete. Each department 
of the college can measure its contribution to health in terms 
of this ideal. 
I do not know of any institution where correlation should 
   
-P-A-G-E-221
Health Education Curriculum 213 
be easier than at Iowa State College. The Arts and Science 
Division is eager to serve the technical Home Economics 
Division. They ask us, “Are you satisfied? Are you - 
getting just the type of subject matter from our departments 
which you want?” One can secure, therefore, for the home 
economics students at Ames, the science work which best 
supplements and strengthens our instruction. 
The next step in correlation, after the setting up of our 
aim, was to make a study of the courses in the college to 
determine where we wanted to develop correlation. This 
revealed some interesting points, a few of which I would 
like to report. One of the best things which the study did 
reveal was that many departments were anxious and de- 
termined to show that they did have a contribution to make 
to health education. 
The Physical Education Department is one of the eight 
main departments of the Home Economics Division, and 
the head of this department is a leader in our health work. 
The Hygiene Department plans to examine every new 
student who comes to college, and will make recommenda- 
tions as to the limiting of hours of college work where the 
student is not in good physical trim. If there are defects 
which need to be corrected, the student is sent to the 
Physical Education Department where the individual gym- 
nastics instructor prescribes and supervises her work. If 
it is a question of overweight or underweight, she is sent 
to the Nutrition Department where a member of the home 
economics staff, who serves half time in the hospital, pre- 
scribes her diet. 
Cards are sent to the desk of the dean of home economics 
every few days. These cards give the names of home 
economics girls who are in the hospital, and their ailment. 
If it is a case of constipation, we send the card to the Nu- 
trition Department. If it is foot trouble, the card is sent 
to the Physical Education Department, with the hope that 
by thus checking up on our instruction the student may be 
more able to apply it in the future. 
The Women’s Guild, the student governing board, has 
been responsible for promoting most of our health contests. 
They have distributed health cards in the dormitories, and 
interested the girls in keeping them. 
The Women’s Athletic Council barred the sale of choc- Where to

  214 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
olates to the students. They encouraged the sale of apples, 
but no chocolates on the campus. 
The Psychology Department has cooperated by working 
out correlations between good grades, intelligence tests, and 
physical fitness. 
The Public Speaking Department encourages good pos- 
ture by their slogan, “Stand well in order to speak well.” 
They are furthering health education by their programs for 
community recreation, for they appreciate the close relation 
between mental health and adequate social and recreational 
opportunities, particularly for our rural communities. 
The Household Administration Department makes its 
contribution to the health program through its study of 
equipment and expenditure of time. No one factor in the 
home will do more to maintain the health of the mind and 
body of the overworked farm woman than will a knowl- 
edge of how to efficiently budget time and decrease physical 
effort by labor saving devices. 
All of our girls in the Clothing Department make dress 
forms. We have discovered that they are very good things, 
not only because of their usefulness in dressmaking, but 
because the dress form is a facsimile of the girl and reveals 
much. The Physical Education Department says to the 
Clothing Department, “We consider it immoral when you 
clothe a girl in frills to cover up her defects which can be 
remedied by sending her to us.” These are only a few il- 
lustrations of correlation, but they serve to indicate our 
general plan. 
Bs seatrel The third point in the program of developing correlation 
needed among departments is the establishment of a Central Com- 
mittee or Council. We have started first with the women 
and have asked for representatives from the departments 
working most closely with us—the dean of women, because 
of her contact with girls, the head of the Physical Educa- 
tion Department, head of the Hygiene Department, the 
dean of the Home Economics Division, a representative 
from the Biology Department, and a representative from 
the students. Through this Council we hope to develop 
keen appreciation of the need of health education by col- 
lege authorities and department heads, and to more actively 
promote the work well begun in the Home Economics 
Division.
-P-A-G-E-223

It may be that we are training disciples of health rather 
than teachers of health education. Both are much needed, 
and we feel confident that home economics women have a 
contribution to make in the promotion of this program for 
health education. 
Wuat ts HeattH EpucaTIoN? 
Miss Pinckney: 
In talking to different people this year I was invariably 
asked, “What are you interested in?” I would say, 
“Health education.” “Oh,” they’d say, “you’re a physical 
training teacher.” I would say, “No.” ‘Well then, 
you’re a nutrition worker.” I’d say, “No.” “Then 
youw’re a nurse.” And I would say, “No.” They'd say, 
“You are none of these things, and still you’re interested 
in health education?” My answer was, “I’m all of them. 
Health education is contributed to by all these various 
departments.” 
Ti I were to go to a nutrition lecture, I’d probably come 
away with the idea that nutrition contributed about 50% 
to health education; and the same way with nursing. It 
seems to me that that is a very narrow feeling. Health 
education is not nursing, is not mental hygiene, is not nu- 
trition. Each one of these things contributes to health 
education. I think that we are so inclined to think that 
health education is just that department in which we are in- 
terested, but it isn’t true. Posture, for instance, does not 
belong to physical education alone. Are we going to allow 
the clothing people to dress a girl so that she looks perfect? 
Or shall we rather see that the Physical Training Depart- 
ment corrects the posture of that girl? A committee might 
be appointed to consider ways and means of bringing before 
teacher training institutions the necessity of making the 
promotion of health a conscious objective in all of its work, 
and the necessity of cooperating with all the other depart- 
ments of the college. 
Mr. Black: 
Is there further discussion? 
Dr. Andress: 
I'd like to suggest that in these teacher training institu- Need of op-

tions it is desirable that at some place in their course they 
may have opportunity to observe in action an ideal school 
from the health point of view, showing the different parts 
of the situation in relation to the goal which that school is 
trying to attain. One of the great difficulties that we have 
is the individual not realizing the importance of other 
people in the teaching class and the contributions which 
might be made. Should we not have something which will 
give a bird’s-eye view of a school or possibly of a city, in 
action, to help the individual student to realize that many 
individuals are a part of a cooperative scheme all trying to 
attain a health goal? 
Dr. Andress’ suggestion brought out two contributions on

Miss Tall, Principal: 
Our health program committee consists of eleven people, 
and includes a resident nurse, a resident physician, two 
instructors in the Physical Education Department, and the 
principal of the elementary school. This committee meets 
every two weeks and is planning a close correlation between 
the work of the different departments. 
The parents of the children in the school are brought in 
at least twice a year. The instructor in hygiene meets them 
and explains what we are trying to do. Besides the el- 
ementary school, we have fourteen practice centers in rural 
districts, and the teacher in hygiene surveys the health work 
in those schools periodically. 
The hygiene work in our school was brought into ex- 
istence through the Interdepartmental Social Hygiene Board 
during the war. We got our start and our appropriation 
that way. We had only a part-time physician in the school 
after the war because we took over all the expense when 
the Social Hygiene Board withdrew its support. : 
Having a full-time physician is a great advance. Our 
physician teaches hygiene in the sophomore year. ‘That is 
a very practicable piece of work. Most physicians, unless
-P-A-G-E-225
  Health Education Curriculum 217 
trained in teaching, are not particularly good teachers; but 
our physician, an eager young man, will help me give the 
course in teaching methods to a group of rural teachers (a 
unit course I give for two weeks). Last year our hygiene 
teacher took a year’s vacation, went to Columbia, worked 
with Dr. Wood there, and made a special study of the 
hygiene program in the Horace Mann School. This study 
including her criticisms, was part of her thesis for her 
degree. As a result, we went into a campaign using Dr. 
Wood’s health scoring card. 
I want to speak now of the elementary school. Our 
hygiene teacher planned the course in hygiene for the el- 
ementary school. The health habits in the first grade are 
checked both by the teacher and by the parent at home. 
The second grade build Mary Gay’s house as a health 
project. Cooking, making dolls’ clothes, supervising dolls’ 
habits, keeping health charts—all come into this project, 
besides getting breakfast, luncheon and dinner, which leads 
to a study of foods that make us grow and that keep us 
well and strong. The reading lessons and the subject 
matter cover personal cleanliness, food, clothing, rest, and 
the minimum health habits. 
In the fifth grade we introduce the child to physiology, 
giving the necessary information for an understanding of 
the reasons for the habits which have been emphasized since 
the first grade. 
The program for sixth grade hygiene was prepared by a 
student teacher. In the seventh a health play is presented 
at assembly. We have an assembly every day, and on 
Wednesday we have what is known as a “department day.” 
On this day a department presents a summary of its work 
to the entire school. 
I might mention that we have found a great deal of 
difficulty in securing a home economics teacher who has 
anything but an academic point of view. We have found 
them very efficient but when we want them to make a survey 
for the use of our two-year normal students, to find out how 
much home economics should be given, they don’t want 
to do it! They want to teach more foods! I believe that 
in a two-year course, everybody must get the point of view 
of job analysis, analyzing what is needed in the field, then 
giving this in a scholarly and practical way. In job anal-

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRACTICE TEACHING 
Miss Strang made the point that since the aim of health 
education and the aim of education in general are essentially 
the same, and the best educational methods should be ap- 
plied to health education, lessons in subjects other than 
health observation should demonstrate: 
(1) Details of classroom management: how the children are 
dismissed, how the room temperature is regulated; how dis- 
order is prevented; what really is the cause of dis- 
order; what kind of questions the skillful teacher asks, etc. 
Questions on classroom management, to guide observation, 
are helpful to the observer, such as: “Is the teacher appro- 
priately dressed? What attention did she give to heat, light, 
posture? Make a list of school habits used to save time 
and energy. When were the pupils most attentive? least at- 
tentive? What were two of the best questions that the 
teacher asked?” 
(2) The best educational methods. A project in English may 
show a teacher how to plan a health project. Seeing a 
teacher guide a class in the solution of a history problem 
may suggest methods which the teacher of health may use. 
(3) Opportunity to find out where health material may legit- 
imately be introduced into these subjects. A fourth grade 
class in studying sugar added such health questions as: “Is 
sugar good for us? Why do grown-ups keep telling children 
not to eat candy?” 
Observations of health lessons is also necessary. The 
ideal person to observe is a grade teacher who is interested 
in health and willing to have practice teachers observe prog- 
ress of the health project which her class is carrying on. 
The short periods assigned to hygiene offer another op- 
portunity for observation and in these lessons the health 
supervisor can illustrate various points in health teaching. 
Such a lesson might show how a class can together solve 
some one of their health problems; or might illustrate the 
use of dramatization or stories. In addition to actual 
observation, stenographic reports of good lessons furnish 
a useful basis for discussion of methods, materials, and 
aims. 
In addition to observing, the practice teacher needs a 
chance to teach the class herself. A number of visits to 
her class first will show her what methods are used, and 
something about the health needs and interests of the class. 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
    
Health Education Curriculum 219 
She should carefully plan her lesson, and give it in the 
period assigned to hygiene. With this preparation for the 
teacher the children will not feel that their instruction in 
health is inferior to their instruction in other subjects. 
The practice teacher may perhaps assist a grade teacher 
who is interested in health education. I have in mind an 
instance where the practice teacher looked up source 
material on the health habits of the Dutch people, and spent 
several periods discussing with the class the health habits 
of the Dutch people and how they compared with ours. 
A third opportunity for practice teaching is in nature 
study or language periods, once a week or more, which the 
grade teacher may be willing to turn over to the health 
teacher. This gives her a chance to work out health les- 
sons in connection with the English or nature study work. 
Two resolutions were passed, in relation to Physical 
Education and Home Economics. These are included in 
the report of the General Session which follows. This 
session then adjourned. 
Joint Discussion 
Professor Turner, Chairman 
Mr. Black was unable to be present and the Chairman 
read a report of the morning session of the Teacher Train- 
ing Section, concluding with the following resolutions 
offered by the committee appointed by the Teacher Train- 
ing Section. 
Resolved: That an effort be made to bring all teachers 
of physical education to a full appreciation of their oppor- 
tunity and obligation with reference to health education; 
and that they be urged to assist this work by promoting 
efforts which look toward a more comprehensive training 
in the related sciences and arts for people engaged as 
directors of physical education. 
Resolved: In view of the fact that health education is 
a very important objective in the work of Home Economics 
Departments, an effort should be made within the home 
economics group to develop a consciousness of the im- 
portance of this objective, emphasizing at the same time the Two resolu- 
tions  
-P-A-G-E-228

desirability of the fullest cooperation with the other related 
departments, in any given institution (such as the depart- 
ments of Physical Education, Fine and Applied Arts, 
Public Speaking and Dramatics) in order to utilize to the 
utmost the potential contributions of those departments. 
These resolutions were accepted by the general session.

ADDITIONAL SPEECHES AT THE 
CLOSING SESSION 
HE sessions of the last two days of the conference were 
given over mainly to discussions of the summary and 
recommendations to be made. As finally accepted by the 
conference these are given on pages 224 to 239. At the 
last meeting, however, several speeches, general in character 
were made. 
Miss Jean: 
As this week’s meetings have progressed, I find myself 
going back over the years since we launched the health 
education program in the Child Health Organization and 
perhaps it is fitting tonight for me to outline for you, in a 
few words, the situation as I see it. In those early days in 
1918, a group of doctors—pediatricians—a section of the 
New York Academy of Medicine—became interested in the 
idea of popularizing health for children of school age; and 
under the guidance of the great Dr. Holt, a committee was 
formed and immediate action begun. It was during the 
war; and it was perhaps a little easier to interest people in 
a cause that was so evidently one that could call upon the 
best in men and women. The first steps were those of de- 
veloping a program which would be of interest to all the 
people. The program was simple; it was concrete; it was 
definite; and the situation does not seem to me very dif- 
ferent today; we are all looking at conditions with critical 
eyes, now as then,—eager for the best methods. 
The few simple laws of health that were launched then 
as “Rules of the Game” in order to keep the program 
simple, concrete and definite, are still the “laws of health” 
which we need to teach to children. 
This group of doctors, with’ educators, and socially- 
minded individuals from all over the country, decided that 
it was worth while to reach the public and, as you know, the 
221 A backward

methods 222 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
popularizing methods of clowns and fairies were devised 
for interesting the man of the street, the woman in the home, 
the teacher in the classroom and the child himself. Miles 
of publicity were secured because stunts were performed; 
we were beginning at what might be called the wrong end, 
but with an entire recognition of the situation, realizing 
that it wasn’t possible to go to doctors, wasn’t possible to 
go to professional groups and reach them so as to get over 
the program that we desired until we sold it to the people 
themselves. It was necessary to use the press and we could 
not use the press unless we popularized health. This 
seems a long time ago, because today we are careful not 
to do spectacular work, but rather to build up from the 
bottom; training workers to teach health to the children 
in the best possible way. However, what we are doing to- 
day could not have been accomplished if popular work had 
not been done first. It was possible for the educator to 
carry on his program with his teachers because the people 
had become interested and were ready; and we must not 
forget that the school administrator can only go as far as 
the people will let him go. We cannot successfully carry 
out a program in which people do not take part. While 
we go on with the program after careful experience in this 
field, we constantly find ourselves on mountains looking 
back and finding people we think to be close beside us, at 
the bottom or half-way up. We can go only as fast and as 
far as the people themselves go. 
As I look over the work of this week it seems to me we 
have taken steps which are very much in advance of those 
made by our first conference. When we look over resolu- 
tions passed today, we realize the strides taken in this past 
year; the breadth of vision, the breadth of understand- 
ing, the demands and standards, which one short year has 
brought forth are most gratifying. We are ready to give to 
children the best that science can give them and the best is 
not too good; we cannot demand too much. There is one 
danger, however, to which I think we need to have our at- 
tention called and that is that we do not want to be too 
critical of results. We have still the great number of 
rural schools where the little untrained school teacher is 
the only one at present to teach health: there isn’t a doctor, 
there isn’t a nurse, there isn’t a physical education teacher.

She is somebody’s daughter who needed a job and was put 
in to teach children. 52% of the teachers of America have 
had no training to teach at all. This 52% must be reached 
as well as the 48%. We do not want such conditions to 
continue; none of us are willing to have them continue. 
But we must realize that the needs of this group must be 
met—usually isolated—crying out for all the help we can 
give. How is it to be done? There is no one answer, of 
course, but teachers’ institutes, opportunities for summer 
courses, simple concrete suggestions must be offered. 
Within the last few months it has been my privilege to 
reorganize the Health Education Division of the American 
Child Health Association which will concentrate after the 
first of July upon a program for the training of the teacher. 
It has seemed, in the reorganization of the Association, 
the best way, as we believe that the only hope of preparing 
leaders lies in the better development of teacher training 
centers. After July first I shall not be with the Associa- 
tion; but Miss Dolfinger, whom you know, is to take charge 
of this division and carry on the work. 
I believe there is a great future for the development of 
such activities as it is going to be possible for the Associa- 
tion to work out. We do not know just what they will be, 
but we ask of you your support, your interest, your faith 
and your confidence. It has been a great privilege to meet 
with you this week, the closing week of my work with the 
Association, and I thank you not only for your confidence 
and interest but for your constant support. 
Professor Turner said that the development described by 
Miss Jean was “‘one of the greatest developments of the last 
half-century”; that the vision was keen and broad and 
“had succeeded because it was a very human vision.” 
American education would suffer if it lost Miss Jean’s serv- 
ices, but since the world needed and demanded such services 
it would not permit them to be lost. 
Miss Dolfinger said the final word of thanks for hospital- 
ity and loyal cooperation during the conference, and ex- 
pressed the hope that the work begun by Miss Jean would 
be carried forward to the hoped-for conclusion. Miss Jean’s

  SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
I. 
II. 
III. ADOPTED BY THE CONFERENCE 
PrersoNaL HEALTH OF STUDENT TEACHER 
Adequate development in health for the student teacher 
is imperative because of its effect upon her happiness 
and teaching efficiency, and because of the necessity 
of a high standard of personal health if she is to de- 
velop proper health standards among her pupils and 
meet her opportunities for leadership in the community. 
A successful health program in the teacher training 
centers demands cooperation of each department in 
the institution or training course. Student health can- 
not be developed through the activity of a single de- 
partment. Unless sound health ideals, attitudes and 
practices are to be found throughout the whole faculty 
group and in the practice school it cannot be expected 
that the student teachers will adequately develop them. 
We must consider the student as a unit and as a hu- 
man being, affected by her environment. 
Departments giving courses of instruction which bear 
upon the subject matter of health or the methods of 
teaching health, must so coordinate their work as to 
provide the student with a well-rounded informational 
basis and the educational technic for making her 
knowledge effective in her schoolroom. 
A complete health examination by a competent physi- 
cian upon the entrance of every student should be the 
basis for the student’s subsequent program. Such an 
examination, however, without adequate follow-up re- 
sulting in actual health maintenance and improvement 
is futile. 
The correction of a poor physical condition by the 
establishing of right habits of living is quite as im- 
portant as a correction demanding medical or surgical 
treatment. 
224
-P-A-G-E-233
    
Summary and Recommendations 225 
The institution or training course is responsible for 
making available the necessary facilities and condi- 
tions for the health improvement required. If addi- 
tional funds are required to secure corrections the in- 
stitution should assist the student to secure them. 
Some institutions are already recognizing the respon- 
sibility of the student to develop the best possible stand- 
ard of health, for that individual. The time is 
doubtless at hand when a reasonable health standard, 
with proper consideration of the limitations of the 
individual, will be demanded as a requisite for 
graduation. 
IV. It is understood that the responsibility for the control 
of living conditions of the students includes the pro- 
vision of proper housing with suitable facilities for 
social life; well-balanced dietary under the supervision 
of a well-trained dietitian; adequate and suitable 
physical activities; necessary medical and nursing 
service and a supervision over the student’s daily pro- 
gram. Very commonly the freshman student in 
teacher training institutions has been found to be carry- 
ing a program, either within the institution or in extra 
curricular activities, which has been heavier than a 
proper consideration of the student’s physical condi- 
tion would permit. 
V. A study of the problem of administering the health 
program in a teacher training institution or in teacher 
training courses demonstrates that the basic respon- 
sibility rests upon the administrative head of such an 
institution or program. He best can organize the req- 
uisite machinery and secure the necessary cooperation 
and coordination among different departments with 
promptness and effectiveness. It has been demon- 
strated that the success of this program depends upon 
the administrator’s appreciation of the problems in- 
volved. 
CoursEs oF STuDY IN TEACHER TRAINING 
INSTITUTIONS 
There is distinct need for developing a technic of measur- 
ing health which may be used in determining the success of  
-P-A-G-E-234
  226 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
the student health program in maintaining and improving 
health. 
The problem of the program of instruction differs ac- 
cording to the type of institution. The following classes of 
teacher training centers are described by the American As- 
sociation of Teachers’ Colleges. 
A. Institution granting a bachelor’s degree and providing a gradu- 
ate work. 
B. Institution with a four year course and granting a bachelor’s 
degree. 
C. Institution with a three or four year course, granting a certifi- 
cate but not a degree. 
D. Institution with a two year course of study and granting a 
certificate. 
In addition, there are normal classes which may be 
grouped as the underprivileged training courses. As these 
courses furnish the only training for a large proportion of 
our rural and small town teachers, it is important to de- 
velop the type of health education training which will meet 
their peculiar needs. In these underprivileged classes the 
one year course must provide opportunity for the develop- 
ment of student health and also subject matter and methods 
of health training. 
In institutions of the first three types a first year course 
in hygiene should be a part of the complete student health 
program above described. The prime object of this course 
should be the improvement of the health of the student. 
In the remaining three years, special training should be 
provided in methods of teaching health. Supplementary 
subject matter courses in allied subjects will be provided 
according to the facilities of the institution. 
It is essential that work in the field of psychology should 
include a consideration of the factors involved in main- 
taining the mental health of normal children and the study 
of maladjustments. 
It is desirable to give academic credit for the required 
course in hygiene. 
Examples of the courses offered, in the various kinds of 
institutions, are to be found in the conference discussions 
of the section meetings.

Summary and Recommendations 227 
PersonaL HEALTH OF THE TEACHER IN SERVICE 
I. Every teacher applying for a position should have an 
examination by a competent and impartial physician 
accredited by the board of education which will en- 
able her to understand her physical limitations, and 
provision should be made for her to correct any 
deficiencies. 
Only healthy applicants should be given permanent 
positions, it being understood that permanent teachers’ 
licenses will not be granted until steps have been taken 
toward reaching the highest physical efficiency. A 
thorough examination should be made, using the form 
prepared by the National Health Council. 
II. The school environment, routine and supervision 
should be such as will make it possible for the teachers 
to remain healthy. 
III. Sick leave on pay is recommended. The teacher’s 
health record should be considered as one factor in 
her professional equipment. 
IV. Teachers’ retirement or pension funds administered 
according to the best practices, are recommended in 
order to eliminate fear of dependence which, at present, 
prevents teachers from occasionally taking the all- 
important year off, for physical and professional re- 
juvenation. For the sake of physical and professional 
rejuvenation teachers should be allowed to take an 
occasional year off with at least half pay. 
In addition to the physical examination it is advised that one 
good text on health of such type as Fisher & Fisk’s How To Live 
or Williams’ Personal Hygiene Applied, be recommended to the 
teacher. A social consciousness should be aroused in Parent-Teacher 
Associations and other organizations as to the importance of main- 
taining the health of a teacher at a high standard. 
Public opinion should be developed so as to make effective or pos- 
sible the foregoing provisions. 
It is the sense of the conference that because there are no figures 
available concerning the health of the teachers in this country a study 
should be made at the earliest possible date for the purpose of ascer- 
taining present conditions. This should serve as a basis for further 
steps in sustaining a high state of teachers’ health efficiency. Along 
with this investigation should go a study of all measures being taken 
to safeguard and promote the health of teachers.

GuipInc PRINCIPLES FOR THE GRADATION OF SUBJECT 
Matter AND DEVELOPMENT OF TEACHING 
METHODS 
I. The following were accepted as principles underlying 
the choice of subject matter for all grades. Though 
each aspect will appear in every grade it was agreed 
that: 
A. The chief emphasis should be on personal health in 
kindergarten to grade six. 
B. The chief emphasis should be on community health and 
socially healthful behavior in grades seven, eight and nine. 
C. The chief emphasis should be on giving a scientific back- 
ground in grades nine to twelve. 
II. The following principles underlying method were ac- 
cepted as forming desirable motivation for health in- 
struction in all grades, namely: 
A. Health education activities should be purposeful, i.e., 
they should develop permanent values for the children 
(self-control, self-direction, self-improvement). 
B. Activities should be of value to children as children. 
C. Activities should provide for the free expression of child 
nature. 
III. A. All grades should use: 
1. Concrete life situations and capitalize these in class- 
room work, 
2. Analogy between child’s development and that of 
plant and animal life, using resources of nature study 
or general science. 
3. The rules of healthy living as the basis for the selec- 
tion of subject matter in all grades. The develop- 
ment of the child and the growing richness of the 
course of study offer that constantly fresh approach 
necessary to prevent monotony. 
4. Emphasis on formation of health habits from the 
kindergarten through grade six. 
B. In the pre-school period the child should: 
1. Acquire nouns for the different parts of the body; verbs 
for its functions. 
2. Form correct health habits associated with this termi- 
nology. 
C. Kindergarten and grades one to three should: 
1. See that all have the same vocabulary and improve 
the technic of health activities associated with the 
terminology. 
2. Represent the routine of healthy living in play sit- 
uations. 
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  
Summary and Recommendations 229 
D. Grades four to six could well base the presentation 
of health subject matter upon: 
1. Interest in life processes of animals and plants. 
2. Interest in acquiring more conscious control of the 
human machine. 
3. More understanding of the significance of health 
habits for the individual, and for basis for develop- 
ment of social responsibility. 
E. Grades seven, eight and nine: 
1. The approach to health teaching is based upon the 
developing of interest in scientific investigation 
manifested at this age. This interest should motivate 
laboratory and field studies in general science and 
civics; this will direct and inform the adolescent’s 
growing sense of responsibility to home, school and 
community. 
2. Man’s ability to control disease through knowledge of 
its causes should here be developed, also a knowledge 
of public health practices. 
3. Development of scientific background for personal 
health should be begun in these grades, through phys- 
iology and hygiene carefully selected and taught. 
4. Performance activities, such as home nursing and 
first aid, are valuable at this age. 
F. Senior high, grades nine to twelve: 
The dominating factor in health instruction through 
these years, should be provision of scientific informa- 
tion applied to health problems,—supplied through the 
coordinated efforts of such specialized departments as 
may exist in high schools as: botany, zoology, biology, 
physiology, bacteriology, chemistry and physics, as 
well as the social sciences, and home economics. 
The above program is necessary to supplement the 
health education work usually done by Departments 
of Physical Education. 
RELATION OF SPECIALISTS TO THE GENERAL HEALTH 
PROGRAM 
I. A specialist is defined as a person on the school staff 
with specialized technical training, not a special 
teacher whose work is dissociated from that of the 
classroom teacher. 
II. Function of specialist in relation to program: 
A. To improve work of classroom teacher through supply-
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
ing sound information of special technics, as in physical 
education. 
B. To supervise instruction when this specially trained 
person has also had adequate teaching preparation and 
experience. 
C. To supply fresh material and inspiration to the class- 
room teacher. 
III. Specific function of each specialist: 
A. Function of nutrition supervisor when one is 
present on school staff: 
a 
2. 
3. 
4) To give to the teacher information concerning the 
nutritive requirement as revealed by modern research. 
In cooperation with other supervisors of instruction 
to develop types of method and correlation. 
To cooperate with the school medical staff in remedial 
work with undernourished children. 
To supervise school lunches in the absence of any 
other adequately trained person. 
B. Function of home economics specialist: 
ve 
3. In addition to teaching the technic of her subject, 
to demonstrate in the home setting, the application to 
daily living of scientific principles underlying health. 
. Where there is no nutrition specialist, the program 
of the adequately trained home economics teacher 
should be arranged so that she may do, in her own 
school, the type of work outlined for the nutrition 
specialist. 
Leadership, guidance, help, cooperation with other 
specialists, as well as with the classroom teachers. 
C. Function of the physical education specialist: 
I 
3: To suggest, adapt and inspire the performance of such 
activities as will provide for the best growth and 
development of the individual and of the group, based 
on the physical examination. 
. To provide that health instruction which is organ- 
ically related to the physical education program. 
(The instruction in the above paragraphs may be 
given by the classroom teacher under supervision, the 
special teacher or the supervisor.) 
To develop permanent recreational interests that will 
carry over into adult life. 
The numerous other specialists often associated in a 
health program were not discussed due to time limitations. 
IV. Coordination of work of specialists: 
Satisfactory cooperation is possible only when the superin- 
tendent sees this need and provides for it. The specialists 
can provide the service, but the superintendent must give the 
opportunity to render the service. The best use of specialists 
 
-P-A-G-E-239
VI. 
VII. 
II. 
II. Summary and Recommendations 231 
is made when there is an administrative director who coordi- 
nates the work of the specialists. This person is responsible 
for administering the program as a whole, for bringing about 
the cooperation of all services to the best interest of the child, 
for securing the cooperation of all school principals with all 
specialists. In addition this office serves as a clearing house 
for the problems from all fields, and as a repository for all 
records. 
. Relation of specialists to classroom teachers: 
The ultimate responsibility for health education of the child 
in the school lies with the classroom teacher. 
The principal function of the specialist is to give consultation 
service to the classroom teacher. 
Function of outside agencies: 
Valuable service may be rendered by outside official agencies, 
including Federal, State and City departments, supplement- 
ing the service of members of the school staff. 
Health education in schools without special health 
supervisors: 
In schools where there is no special supervisor of health edu- 
cation, the responsibility for the health education program 
must rest with the superintendent or his assistants whose duty 
it will be to use doctor or nurse and all other available spe- 
cially trained workers in city, county, or State, to assist 
teachers on the technical side, while they themselves provide 
the enthusiasm for health which will cause the principals 
and teachers to make it a major educational objective. 
Pre-ScHooL HEALTH PROGRAM 
Since the habits and attitudes acquired in pre-school 
years play an important part in adult life, a health 
program should be formulated for the pre-school 
years. 
Child care and child training are inseparable. Par- 
ents, teachers, doctors, nurses and social workers 
should not only minister to the child’s physical needs, 
but should be so versed in child management that in 
the performance of physical care, they also help to 
establish right habits and attitudes. 
Laboratories in the pre-school field, such as habit 
clinics and nursery schools, are performing invalu- 
able service in providing information related to child 
care and child training for parents and professional 
workers. The need for extending this type of ex- 
periment is recognized. Such centers are most effec- 
Nv
-P-A-G-E-240
  
  232 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
tive when associated with institutions of higher 
learning. 
IV. The health of the child is ultimately the responsibil- 
ity of the home. All forms of organization that unify 
home and school, such as Parent-Teacher, School 
Nursing and Visiting Teachers Associations should 
be encouraged and developed and their activities co- 
ordinated. The rural districts are particularly in 
need of this type of service because of the isolation of 
the rural home. 
STANDARDS FOR JUDGING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A 
ScHooL HEALTH PROGRAM 
The purposes of a school health program include the 
following: 
1. To develop health habits. 
2. To impart health knowledge. 
3. To achieve physical health and the best possible development. 
4. To create a health attitude. 
While recognizing the desirability of developing every 
possible method for measuring the results of a school health 
program it must be recognized that there are fundamental 
benefits from such activities which are not at present sub- 
ject to physical measurement. 
The following tests were suggested, however, which may 
be developed and applied in measuring certain results of 
health education: 
. Health habit questions. 
- Recognition tests. 
. Immunization record for smallpox and diphtheria. 
. Physical ability tests. 
. Correction of individual physical defects. 
. Thorough physical examination (doctor’s rating of child). 
. Growth records. 
. Sanitation score cards of school buildings 
(a) construction 
(b) use 
(c) air conditions in room.t 
COIAnNAWHE 
A need is recognized for the further development of 
methods by which growth and the physical status of the 
1See report of New York State Commission on Ventilation. Dutton 1923.
-P-A-G-E-241
  Summary and Recommendations 233 
child may be used in the measurement of health improve- 
ment. 
A standardized method of recording the physical condi- 
tion and physical defects of school children would be ex- 
tremely useful. 
All data regarding the relationship of groups of children 
to the normal weight for the height and age should carry 
with them when presented to the public, a statement show- 
ing how the data were collected, including the method of 
taking weight and height, the unit of measure used, the 
nature and the presence or absence of shoes or clothing, 
whether height or age were taken at the same time, and the 
method by which each was computed. 
The use of growth as a means of interesting children in 
health should not be confused with the use of growth as a 
measure of health improvement or as a diagnostic agent. 
Educators are urged to use such definite measures of the 
value of the health program as are available, to appreciate 
the limitations of those measurements which are not definite, 
but to remember at the same time, the importance of the 
effect of health education upon attitude and school morale. 
PuysicaL EXAMINATION OF SCHOOL CHILDREN 
I. The aim of such an examination is to provide for 
every child a chance to achieve the limit of his en- 
dowed capacity for well-being: 
II. The functions of the participants should be as 
follows: 
A. Physician 
1. To provide guidance toward better health through 
education of the children. 
2. To provide an examination service which (1) dis- 
covers all physical defects, diseases, incipient condi- 
tions and tendencies toward ill health among school 
children, (2) finds sources for remedy. 
B. Nurse 
1. To assist the physician at the examination. 
2. To assist in interpreting results of the. examination 
to child, teacher and parents in school and home 
through instructional conferences. 
3. To stimulate and secure correction of physical handi- 
caps. 
C. Teacher and parents
-P-A-G-E-242
    234 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
1. To be present at the examination and to supply in- 
formation relative to history and habits of the child. 
2. To secure the cooperation of the children through 
class and individual instruction. 
3. To gain knowledge from the examination that shall 
function as a basis for further health teaching. 
III. In conclusion, the superintendent or principal may 
expect through the coordination of the work of physi- 
cian, nurse, teacher and parent: 
Better attendance. 
A reduction in undernourishment. 
A gradual decrease in preventable retardation. 
A safe system of education from the standpoint of health, 
a larger appreciation of health ideals and a greater prac- 
tice of healthy living throughout the community. 
REPORTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF COM- 
MITTEES AND ROUND TABLES 
Report OF COMMITTEE ON HomME Economics 
com> 
The resolution passed at the meeting of the Teacher 
Training Section on Wednesday, June 25th, was reinforced 
by the following recommendations of the committee on 
home economics: 
1. That, realizing that health is one of the major aims of 
their work, Home Economics Departments seek the coopera- 
tion of all other departments that may contribute to extend- 
ing the scope and helpfulness of their health education 
program. 
2. That, cooperationg fully in a health education pro- 
gram of teacher training institutions and other institutions 
of higher learning, Home Economics Departments make 
their contribution to the health life of all the students. 
This committee asks that a copy of this report be sent to 
the president of the American Home Economics Association 
with a request that it be brought before the Association for 
working out a constructive program to bring before Home 
Economics Departments of normal schools, colleges and 
universities. 
Majority REporT OF COMMITTEE ON PHYSICAL 
EpucaTION 
Realizing that an increasing demand will be made on
-P-A-G-E-243
  Summary and Recommendations 235 
the teacher of physical education to assume leadership in 
developing a health education program; and realizing 
that, though in the normal schools of physical education 
much of the subject matter taught is basic in a health edu- 
cation program, it is in the present schedule unrelated to 
such a program; be it resolved: that the conference ask 
the American Child Health Association to call the atten- 
tion of the normal schools of physical education to the im- 
portance of including in their curriculum either by addi- 
tion or substitution a general course in health education. 
Such a course not only to correlate the work already offered 
but also to add to the material at hand a broad and com- 
prehensive survey of the possibilities in the development of 
a health education program. Among the other courses sug- 
gested are: 
. Personal hygiene and public health. 
. Mental hygiene. 
. Psychology of the learning process. 
. Methods of health teaching. 
. Health administration. 
. Nutrition. 
Dr. Howe dissented but made no written report. Lack 
of time prevented further deliberation and the reaching of 
a unanimous conclusion. 
Anhwne 
HeattH Epucation Nreps or HicH SCHOOLS 
A round-table discussion of this topic resulted in the 
following recommendations: 
In urging health education we desire to define our under- 
standing of the meaning of health in terms of capacity to 
achieve optimal adjustment to the demands of life without 
excessive or undue strain and stress, and in addition the 
possession of a conscious sense of enjoyment due to the 
exercise of the faculties in constructive and wholesome 
channels. 
We feel that the essential point that differentiates hu- 
mans from other beings is that while the rest of the living 
world primarily adapts itself to its environment, man in 
addition changes the environment to suit his ends. To 
effect this change in the environment, it is essential that 
the individual possess a positive personality and enough 
vital energy over and above that required by routine exist-
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  236 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
ence. It should be the aim of health education to achieve 
this vitality plus. 
The high school curriculum should be re-examined to 
determine its fatigue production in the students, and to 
adapt the curriculum as it seems necessary and advisable so 
as to eliminate as much as possible these fatigue elements. 
We recommend that the curriculum be worked out on a 
work-rest-play basis. In this connection we recommend 
that the extra-school activities of the child be taken into 
consideration. 
We recommend that in the formulation of the curriculum 
and the teaching of the subjects, all of the principles of 
’ mental hygiene be observed and followed. In view of the 
fact that in the period of adolescence the individual is 
obliged to abandon earlier life conceptions and develop in 
their stead new ones, we recommend that there should begin 
in junior high school, either in already existing courses of 
civics, home economics or hygiene or through provision of 
new courses, some instruction in the psychology of behavior 
| as applied to childhood, both for its applications to the 
' students’ own problems, and its application to other life 
situations. 
We recommend that means be established to carry on re- 
search work concerning the question of fatigue in school 
children, and that methods be devised by which school 
teachers or others connected with school activities, could 
determine fatigue among children in school. 
HeattH Epucation In MepicaL INSTITUTIONS 
A group of conference members interested in this subject 
came together for luncheon at the Food Clinic of the Boston 
Dispensary to consider health education as an integral part 
of hospitals, dispensaries and clinics. They presented the 
following recommendation to the conference: 
Realizing the opportunity for supplementing the health 
education of the school by emphasizing health and the 
prevention of disease at the same time the child is receiving 
treatment and correction of defects; 
And appreciating the opportunity which such clinic 
teaching offers in the education of physicians, nurses, nutri- 
tion and medical social workers; 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
  Summary and Recommendations 237 
The group would like to present to this conference for 
their consideration, the advisability of including in the 
next conference a discussion of this subject. 
HEALTH EpucaTION MATERIALS AND DEVICES 
A round-table discussion of this topic resulted in the fol- 
lowing recommendations and summary: 
1. That material prepared for use in health education 
should have a scientific basis of fact. 
2. That contemplated health material should be submit- 
ted to experts in medicine, nutrition, art, pedagogy, and 
other fields related to health education, in order to insure 
its soundness. 
3. That its presentation be such as to fit in with the ap- 
proved methods in education—with particular emphasis 
upon purposeful activity of the child, stimulated by condi- 
tions in his own environment. That source material for 
the teacher and pupils is of more value than hard and fast 
rules for procedure. That the kind of material prepared 
be determined by the characteristics and needs and develop- 
ment of the groups for which it is intended. 
4. That the publishing companies should consider the 
artistic qualities of coloring and illustrations and that every 
effort be made to make health material examples in this 
respect. 
5. That a demand from educators in general would raise 
the standard of health publications as to arrangement, con- 
tent and scientific basis since publishers try to meet the pop- 
ular demand. 
6. That good illustrative material with a sound scientific 
basis is very much needed and that preparation of such 
material might with advantage be sponsored by large na- 
tional organizations as a means of improving the character 
of instruction in the field. 
7. That every effort be made to stimulate originality and 
initiative in making use of such illustrative material as is 
within the reach of the average teacher through demonstra- 
tions of the use of this type of material in teacher training 
classes. 
8. That before magazine illustrations or extracts be used 
in connection with definite hygiene instruction it should be 
passed upon by medical experts as to its soundness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  288 Cambridge Health Education Conference 
9. That illustrative material if well chosen may be in- 
valuable in developing thought, in fixing knowledge and in 
encouraging correlations in the school program. 
10. That the outstanding need at present is for helps in 
correlating such subjects as history, geography, writing, 
with health, since incidental correlations are invaluable be- 
cause of their associations. 
11. That the presentation of children’s original expres- 
sions are valuable in teacher training classes and in class- 
rooms, because they represent “original documents.” That 
the value of the production of this material does not lie 
in the end result, but in the attitudes and associations 
which accompany their production. 
Rurat ScHooL NEEDS 
A round table discussion of this topic resulted in a report 
to the conference that there is need for sanitary individual 
drinking cups for rural schools; a safe milk supply for 
school lunches; and sanitary drinking water. Milk for 
the noon hot lunch would of course be sterilized by cooking. 
For the mid-morning lunch each child should bring his 
own supply, for the sanitary condition of which his own 
family would be responsible. 
A further discussion of this topic at a general session 
resulted in two recommendations: 
1. That the conference go on record as advising individ- 
ual paper cups for rural children as well as for city chil- 
dren. Neither tin nor aluminum cups are satisfactory. 
Paper cups are like some other things we may not have, 
but believe to be practical necessities. 
2. That the conference go on record as recommending 
that State departments of health be urged to properly ex- 
amine and regularly inspect the water supply of rural 
schools because of the importance of the water supply in 
relation to disease prevention. 
HeaLttH Work IN LEISURE-TIME ORGANIZATIONS

to discuss the relation of health work in schools and health
-P-A-G-E-247
  
  Summary and Recommendations 289 
work in such voluntary leisure-time organizations as the 
Boy and Girl Scouts, the Camp Fire Girls, etc. 
While no formal recommendations were made, it was the 
sense of the conference 
1. That such organizations should not encourage boys 
and girls to engage in camping or hiking activities without 
competent medical and health examinations and recom- 
mendations. 
2. That volunteer leaders in such organizations should 
be informed of health activities and instruction in the 
schools and where possible should make use of school 
health records. 
3. That investigation might well be made of the health 
of two groups of school children under the same school 
conditions, one group members of leisure-time organiza- 
tions, the other not. 
4. That the camp activities of these oragnizations fur- 
nish special opportunities for the study and control of nu- 
trition groups and for interesting boys and girls themselves 
in food grouping and habits. 
5. That in any revision of their health programs and 
their handbooks, these organizations should consult health 
experts and include the most modern principles and prac- 
tices.

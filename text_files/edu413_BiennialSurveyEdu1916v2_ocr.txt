INTRODUCTION. 
\ The educational movements that have been taking place in Great 
Britain during the past two or three years have aroused widespread 
interest among teachers and publicists in this country. The fol- 
lowing report is an attempt to analyze these movements and to 
indicate their significance in the broader movement for -reconstruc- 
tion. The educational reforms that have already been introduced 
and the developments that are promised for the future are not merely 
the result of an emotional reaction induced by the war. Their mean- 
ing will be entirely lost unless their position in the wider program is 
realized. Nor are the mere details of the new acts of great signifi- 
cance in themselves, however striking the promised. increase in edu- 
cational expenditure, or the raising of the school age, or the increased 
supervision of adolescent welfare may be. For the student of edu- 
cation the feature that is of profound significance is the recognition 
that a sound educational system is the best foundation for the social 
and political reconstruction that must follow the war, and since the 
keynote of this reconstruction is the improvement of the position and 
opportunities of every man and woman as an individual and as a 
citizen, the educational reforms must be considered as a contribution 
toward the further development of the aspirations of democracy and 
humanity. 
The present report aims accordingly to give in broad outline the 
general features of the developments of the past few years. It makes 
no attempt to deal exhaustively with the course of educational 
thought or progress during this time. In many cases this would be 
impossible.. The influences of the war on education have not yet 
spent themselves, and to that extent it has not been deemed wise to 
deal with certain topics that will bear fruitful study at a later 
5

6 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
date. It is premature, for example, to consider the effects of the 
war on university education. The universities have practically been 
depleted, and the energies of those who remained in them were 
devoted to war work in the main. It would be mere guesswork to 
attempt to predict their future course. The same arguments apply 
to the effects of the war on the education of women. ‘To the extent 
that the educational reforms already considered aim to extend the 
opportunities for general education, to that extent the opportunities 
are open to boys and girls, to men and women equally. But what 
influence the increased participation of women in general public 
activities during the war will exercise on education, it would be 
premature to decide. Technical and vocational education in general 
will undoubtedly be profoundly affected both in their administration 
and in their underlying pedagogy by the new methods of training 
in which the demands of efficiency and speed had to be met. At 
present, however, any interpretation of the developments in training 
for war work must be postponed until sufficient data are at hand to 
warrant adequate conclusions or to afford reliable guidance for 
normal practice. 
The following pages deal with the course of education and school 
medical inspection during the past few years, with the proposals for 
the reform of secondary education, with the various Government 
reports on different branches of education, and finally with the de- 
velopments that led up to the passage of the education act in Eng- 
land and the significance of the act itself. A similar but briefer 
account is given of educational conditions in Scotland. Ireland is 
included, although her educational system is unlike those of England 
and Wales or Scotland, mainly because the stirrings for reform are 
noticeable there and are directly influenced by the events on the other 
side of the Channel. Indeed, no part of the British Empire will 
remain unaffected by the Fisher Act. Recent educational reports 
from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand indicate that attention 
had already been directed to England before the Fisher bill was 
placed on the statute book. 
Much has been attributed to the education act that is not contained 
therein. The act must be read in connection with the act of 1902 to 
obtain a picture of the English educational system, but it must 
always be remembered that the Board of Education has the power to 
modify or extend the system by administrative regulations and that 
its annual codes have the effect of law when presented to Parlia- 
ment. The system thus combines a legal minimum wish the flexibility 
and elasticity that insure progress. In general the act of 1918 makes 
the following provisions: 
1. Extension of the age of compulsory attendance, without exemp- 
tion, to 14; or to 15 and even 16 by local by-laws. : 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 7 
2. Provision for medical inspection and treatment and physical 
welfare before and through school to 18. 
8. Establishment of nursery schools for children between 2 and 5 
or 6. 
4. Establishment of compulsory continuation school attendance 
from 14 to 16 and ultimately to 18. 
5. Promotion and support of poor but able pupils, with free tuition, 
scholarships, and maintenance grants. 
6. Concentration of supervision over the activities and welfare of 
children and adolescents in the hands of educational authorities, e. g., 
child labor and employment, labor bureaus, recreation and health. 
7. Inspection and supervision of private schools. 
8. Preservation of the independence of local authorities, extension 
of their functions and powers, and insistence on minimum standards 
with encouragement through grants to advance as far as possible. 
9. Equal distribution of the cost of education between local rates 
and national taxes. 
The act does not define the character of advanced work in the ele- 
mentary schools nor the nature of the work in the new continuation 
schools; it barely refers to secondary schools which are undergoing 
many changes through administrative regulations; teachers’ salaries 
are only indirectly touched upon. The most serious omission not only 
in the act but in the general discussion of the educational needs of 
the time is the absence of all reference to the training of teachers. 
The only guaranty for the success of the reconstruction program is 
the teacher, and yet the means by which he is to be trained have not 
been discussed. Improved salaries and pensions will undoubtedly 
produce a large number of good candidates, but in themselves salaries 
and pensions can not make good teachers. The existing system of 
training was regarded as inadequate for the needs of the elementary 
schools; for the secondary schools a very small percentage of teachers 
had specific training for teaching; while for the new continuation 
schools a new type of teacher must be developed. Parliamentary 
procedure is not required for the reorganization of the whole system 
and methods of training teachers; it rests with the Board of Educa- 
tion, and it remains to be seen how these needs will be met. 
For the American student peculiar interest attaches to the educa- 
tional reforms of Great Britain. They represent a genuine attempt 
to realize the ideals for which the war has been fought. As a con- 
tribution toward a definition of democracy through the schools, they 
will command the attention of English-speaking educators the world 
over. But in the present crisis in American education, the principles 
on which these reforms are founded deserve particular attention. 
Whether they will be realized in the near future or not, the hopes 
of those who desire to see increasing participation of the Federal  
-P-A-G-E-8

Government in the educational procedure of the United States are 
inevitably bound up with the consideration of such questions of 
administration as Great Britain has already determined. Such prob- 
lems as the relation of the central to local authorities in educational 
affairs, the reconciliation of centralized supervision with the promo- 
tion of local initiative and progress, the due apportionment of central 
and local expenditure for education, have been settled by that genius 
for compromise that characterizes the British Government. In this 
country these problems still call for decision within State boundaries, 
and have barely been hinted at in the larger program that is now 
before the public. Those who fear bureaucratic control, as well as 
those who apprehend local indifference as a consequence of external 
action, may study both the English and the Scottish systems with 
profit. In addition some of the concrete provisions of the English act, 
as analyzed above, ai.ord an indication of some of the necds that still 
remain to be met in this country on a wider scale than at present. 
For the rest both British and American students can to-day cooperate 
in promoting the world cause of democracy by learning to under- 
stand each other, and by carefully observing the contribution that 
each is making through the education of future generations toward 
the common cause. 
ENGLAND. 
THE SCHOOLS DURING THE WAR. 
The past two years wil prove to be the most notable in the history 
of English education. They will bear testimony to the awakening 
on the part of the whole nation to the value of a comprehensive 
national organization of education. The enactment of a new educa- 
tional law August, 1918, is but the culmination of a period of activ- 
ity and thought in the field of education that is almost unparalleled 
in the annals of English history. The most striking feature of the 
movement is not the volume of literature or the number of reports by 
professional organizations and Government commissions on different 
phases of education, so much as the popular interest in the subject as 
reflected in the current press and magazines. For the first time, 
prdbably, a welcome has been given to the various discussions of ed- 
ucation, hitherto reserved only for reports of scholarship and ex- 
amination results or of speeches at prize distributions. Events have 
fully justified the statement in the Report of the Board of Educa- 
tion for 1915-1916 that: 
The war is giving new impetus and vigor to many movements for national 
reform and is enabling them to gain an amount of support which under normal 
conditions could only have been won after many years of slow progress; and 
 
-P-A-G-E-9
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 9 
one of the most significant manifestations of its influence is the great develop- 
ment of public interest in education. 
Public sentiment was aroused to the recognition that “a pro- 
gressive improvement and development of public education is more 
than ever essential to the national welfare.” The most hopeful sign, 
of the present movement is that it is fundamentally a movement of 
the people. Without disparaging the efforts of the numerous pro- 
fessional bodies and other associations, it is not too much to claim 
that the representatives of labor and the Workers’ Educational 
Association have played the most important part in stimulating pub- 
lic opinion, which only three months before the outbreak of the war 
received with very little interest the announcement of the Chancellor 
of the Exchequer that plans were being prepared for “ a comprehen- 
sive and progressive improvement of the educational system.” The 
movement is based on the profound conviction that the further 
development of democracy depends upon a more adequate education 
than has hitherto been provided. ‘Lhere is not associated with it 
primarily the purpose of improving the educational system to fur- 
nish better tools for economic competition at home or abroad. It is 
animated wholly by the aim of providing the best opportunities for 
equipping the individual with the physical, moral, and intellectual 
training that makes for good citizenship, that prepares for the free- 
dom and responsibilities of adult life. Less conscious, but. no less 
profound, is the patriotic motive to establish a memorial to those 
who have died that democracy might live, a national tribute to their 
self-sacrifice and devotion. Speaking at the conference on new ideals 
in education, in August, 1917, Mr. Fisher emphasized this conception 
and pointed to an interesting historical parallel. He said: 
I will conclude with one reflection, which you will pardon me for making 
because I make it in my character of the historical pedant. I remember in 
old days reading the story of the foundation of the University of Leyden. The 
University of Leyden was founded in the year 1574 by the Prince of Orange 
to commemorate the triumphant issue of the great and heroic siege of Leyden, 
when, as you will remember, the gallant burghers of that starving and be- 
leaguered city managed to hold out against the overwhelming forces of Catholic 
Spain. The memorial of that heroic event was the foundation of a university, 
a university which in the course of a generation achieved for itse!f the renown 
of being one of the most famous centers of light and learning, the University 
of Scaliger and the University of Grotius, and I suggest to you, ladies and 
gentlemen, that our memorial of this war should be a great University of 
England, which should be the means of raising the whole population of this 
country to a higher level of learning and culture than has hitherto b .n 
possible.* 
It is not claimed that what has been accomplished is either the 
most or the best that could pare been achieved, but considering ie

-P-A-G-E-10
10 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
conditions under which the progress has been made, and remember- 
ing the prewar attitude to education, there is little cause for criticism. 
,The point that needs renewed emphasis is that public opinion in 
England has been changed and the history of the past two or three 
years furnishes a euarantee that whatever measures have been intro- 
duced to reorganize education represent but the foundations for a 
‘greater future. Education is but one of the many proposals con- 
, tained in the broad reconstruction program, the realization of any 
one of which must necessarily and inevitably exercise a powerful 
influence on the others. What has been achieved so far is only a 
beginning of that self-conscious democracy which is the basis of any 
progressive system of education. 
It is pertinent to review the conrse of English education in the 
four years between the ovtbreak of the war and the passing of the 
education act of 1918. The outbreak of the war found England 
wholly unprepared to meet the conditions arising out of the emer- 
gency. No provision existed for housing the new army, nor were 
there any plans for securing the large amount of civilian aid. neces- 
sary to maintain the military services, A Jareve share of the new 
burden fell upon the schools, many of which were commandeered by 
the Government for barracks or hospitals. Plans had to be impro- 
vised to take care of the dispossessed pupils at a time when numbers 
of teachers were either flocking to the colors or entering other civilian 
occupations that seemed to promise greater scope for national service 
and always carried larger remuneration than teaching. The situa- 
tion, described in the Report of the United States Commissioner of 
Education for 1916, remains unchanged and is thus summarized in 
the Report of the Board of Education for 1916-17: 
The continuance of the war has inevitably imnosed an increased strain upon 
the publie educational service. Further calls have been made upon the admin- 
istrative and teaching staffs of local education authorities and school governing 
bodies for service in Your Majesty’s forces, and an increased burden has been 
placed on those who have remained to carry on the work of the schools; difficul- 
ties of school accommodation have been intensified, owing to shortage of labor 
and materials; supplies of school equipment have had to be still more severely 
restricted; and in many other ways sacrifices have been required which are 
bound to react unfavorably upon the work of education. But the extent of 
these sacrifices only emphasizes the admirable spirit with which the school 
authorities, teachers, and children have cooperated to mitigate their ill effects. 
The ease with which the schools have adjusted themselves to the 
new demands and the emergency conditions, constantly becoming 
more serious because of the decreasing supply of teachers, bears ex- 
cellent testimony to the flexibility of the system and the initiative of 
the local authorities. The educational loss, except for those pupils   
1Vol. I, pp. 552i.
-P-A-G-E-11
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 11 
who by a misguided policy were released from school as early as the 
age of 11, has not been very great. Double sessions were introduced 
where the dislocation caused by the military occupation of schools was 
severe; nonessentials were eliminated from the curriculum; more or- 
ganized games and plays under suitable supervision were added; and 
wherever opportunity permitted, classroom work was replaced by 
visits to museums, art galleries, and the country. Indeed, the read- 
justments may prove in the future to have been beneficial, if only 
because they have succeeded in breaking down some of the academic 
and bookish formalism in the schools. 
But even if the pupils had wholly missed any part of the tradi- 
tional curriculum, such a loss has been more than compensated for by 
their participation in national activities and by a quickened sense of 
patriotism resulting from their sacrifices in the common cause. The 
Report of the Board of Education, in giving emphasis to this aspect 
of the school progress in 1916-17, states that: 
The year has been noteworthy for its demonstration of the advantages which 
can be derived from enlisting the cooperation of the educational institutions 
of the country in the promotion of various national movements, 
Not only have the pupils been stimulated by the part played in the 
war by alumni, or by their appearance in the school, but also by prac- 
tical work that supplied some of the war needs. The boys, for exam- 
ple, have made splints, crutches, bed boards and rests, screens, rollers, 
and trays; the girls have knitted socks, mufllers, and gloves; both have 
cooperated in making up and sending parcels for soldiers and prison- 
ers, and even in preparing sandbags and candles for the trenches. 
More significant even than this work done in the schools and by the 
pupils is the new position assumed by the schools as community 
centers. The schools have been found useful and convenient centers 
for distributing public notices, disseminating information on food 
conservation and war recipes, the promotion of thrift campaigns, and 
the sale of war loans. The Board of Education’s Report cites a num- 
ber of instances of the successful war-savings campaigns conducted 
by schools. One school of 1,400 pupils in three months purchased war 
certificates to the value of $2,925; another with 500 pupils joined the 
War-Saving Association and bought certificates to the value of $1,170; 
and still another with 400 pupils invested $7,785. Out of 35,000 war- 
savings associations in existence at the end of June, 1917, about one- 
third were connected with elementary schools. In promoting food 
cconomy the lessons imparted to the children have not been lost on 
the parents, especially when these lessons were practically demon- 
strated in the domestic economy classes; in some instances such classes 
were also conducted for parents and adults, and exhibitions have been 
held in cookery and housecraft. Not only have the schools proved to 
be effective agencies in inculcatine the new economy in the matter of 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
food, but they have participated in no small degree in increasing the 
supply. School gardens and vacant lots have been developed in 
constantly increasing areas. 
In the County of Durham the area of school gardens has increased by 40 acres, 
in Hertfordshire by 27, in Buckinghamshire and Lancashire by 16 and 10, 
respectively. The largest number of new school gardens known to have been 
worked during the year were 349 in the West Riding, 200 in Durham, 145 in 
Buckinghamshire, and 102 in Northumberland. The development of gardening 
in certain towns, where the conditions of climate and soil are often unfavorable, 
is equally striking; 26 of the 32 schools in Birkenhead now have gardens; and 
all the schools at Ilkeston and Kendal have taken up land; so have 11 out of 
the 14 public elementary schools at Southend, and 9 of the 11 at Winchester. 
More than half the schools in the county boroughs of Leicester and Nottingham 
have started gardens during the year; Manchester has 18 school gardens, Shef- 
field and Tottenham have each 12, while London has about 100 gardens with 3 
acres of land in all. 
In addition, older pupils in elementary and secondary schools have 
assisted with the harvests and in fruit-picking, and in, the collection 
of horse-chestnuts for certain industrial processes conducted by the 
ministry of munitions. 
The credit for this “quickened consciousness of personal and national 
ties, the keener sense of common sacrifice and common duty,” is in no 
small part due to the teachers, who have risen in a remarkable manner 
to the great task of national service. More than 25,000 of the teachers 
joined the colors, and of these some 2,000 have already made the 
supreme sacrifice. Positions that were left vacant were filled in part 
by married women and teachers already retired from service. With 
an inadequate supply and the constant drain to other occupations 
where the desire for what appears to be more immediate service is 
satisfied and increased remuneration is offered, the burden made in- 
creasing demands on the energy and devotion of those who remained. 
By their service in and out of the schools teachers have assured them- 
selves a position in the life of the nation that they have never enjoyed 
before. 
When peace is restored the teachers of England need have no fear if any- 
one asks them what they did in the war. They offered themselves freely, and, 
whether they stayed in the schools or carried arms, they did their duty, and 
the service of education is richer for their own practice and exemplification of 
those principles of civic duty and patriotism which in times of peace they 
taught, and not in vain, by precept and exhortation.* 
The repute and status achieved by the teaching profession will 
react both upon the general belief in education and on the efficiency 
of the public system of education. In concrete practice the awakening 
of the national conscience to the inadequate remuneration of teachers 
and the poor outlook offered to teaching as a career was slow to-   
1 Board of Education, Report for 1914~-15, p. 4.

EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 13 
manifest itself until the rising cost of living and the prospects in 
other occupations demanded drastic measures. Local action, dilatory 
at first, was stimulated by state grants, and the reports of the de- 
partmental committees for inquiring into the principles which should 
determine the construction of scales of salaries for teachers in both 
elementary, secondary and technical schools promise a new era and 
open up brighter prospects for the profession.t It is not without 
significance that the appearance of the first volume of the New 
Register of teachers issued by the Teachers’ Registration Council, 
one of whose main purposes is to build up a unified national teaching 
profession with well-organized training, qualifications, and standards, 
should have coincided with the beginnings of this new movement. 
Important as the developments in education have been during the 
past few years, and however bright the promise for the future, the 
war has had its bad effects, all of which were noted in the Report . 
of the United States Commissioner of Education for 1916, pages 
554 to 560. Conditions have remained practically unchanged in 
the matter of the military occupation of buildings both for elemen- 
tary and secondary school purposes. The call on teachers for mili- 
tary service has also remained approximately the same. Owing to 
the suspension of the collection of statistics by the Board of Educa- 
tion, exact figures can not be given as to the number of children of 
school age absent from school for employment in ecriculture and 
’ industry. The probability is that the number has been considerably 
reduced for a number of reasons: The Board of Education has 
strongly opposed the early withdrawal of children from school, and 
remonstrated against the abuse of the school attendance laws; the 
boards of trade and of agriculture have taken steps to meet the short- 
age of labor; wide publicity was given to the subject both before and 
during the consideration in Parliament’ of the Fisher bill, which 
aimed to raise the age of school attendance to 14 without any ex- 
emption. But the evil effects of the early release of some 600,000 
children from school in the first three years of the war, some perma- 
nently, under the plea of war emergency, may only be realized in 
the future, for the new act is not retroactive, and many children 
will never again come under formal educative influences of any kind. 
The alarm aroused in 1916 by the great increase of juvenile delin- 
quency during the war had the salutary effect of turning public at- 
tention to the problem. Whether the number of juvenile offenses 
has decreased or not, it is impossible to say, but the remedial and 
preventive measures have been increased. Wide publicity was given, 
| for example, to the report of an unofficial cinema commission ap- 
pointed by the National Council of Public Morals at the instance of   
1See pp. 57 ff,
-P-A-G-E-14
    14 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
a number of firms interested in the cinematograph or moving- 
picture business. The report deals with the physical, mental, and 
moral effects of the moving-picture and recommends that: 
For its own protection, as well as for the insuring of its continued suitability 
to the Nation, the cinema should have the support and the official countenance 
of the State. We want to place it in a position of real dignity. We want it to 
be something more than a trade; in fact, we wish it to be one of the assets of 
our national entertainment and recreation. We are anxious that the cinema 
should be beyond all suspicion in the mind of the average member of the public. 
To attain these objects the commission urges the establishment of a 
State censorship, but admits that much progress has been made within 
the trade for the improvement of films. The Board of Education, 
recognizing that much of the delinquency among school children is 
due to lack of parental control and discipline in cases where the adult 
male relatives may be at the front and the mothers engaged on war 
work, has taken steps to encourage the development of evening play 
and recreation centers for public elementary school children, along 
the lines successfully inaugurated in London by Mrs. Humphry 
Ward, by offering to pay a grant equal to 50 per cent of the cost of 
maintenance of such centers incurred either by the local authorities 
or by the voluntary agencies. During the session ending July 31, 
1917, 71 such centers had been recognized for purposes of the grant. 
For older children who have already left school the Board of Edu- 
cation has, at the request of the Home Office, issued a circular urging 
upon local education authorities— 
the importance of getting into close touch with boys’ and girls’ clubs and brigades 
and similar organizations concerned with the welfare of children, and suggesting 
that they might offer to place schoolrooms at the disposal of such bodies in 
order to enable them to extend the ccope of their work. 
The Home Ofiice also appointed a juvenile organizations committee 
to consider— 
1. What steps can be taken to attract boys and girls to become members of

by the departmental committee on juvenile education in relation to 
employment after the war, while considerable activity has been mani-

fested by a number of local education authorities in establishing or 
reorganizing juvenile employment bureaus under the education 
(choice of employment) act of 1910. Here again public sentiment 
has been prepared by a revelation of the urgent need of some meas- 
ures to safeguard the physical, moral, and intellectual welfare of 
adolescents and to accept the inclusion in the new act of the compul- 
sory continuation school and the extra-curricular activities recom- 
mended in connection therewith. 
In the absence of statistical reports it is impossible to measure the 
effect of the war on educational expenditures accurately. There was 
undoubtedly a tendency toward retrenchment in the first few months 
of the war, just as there was to a laxer administration of attendance 
laws, a weakening of discipline, and the premature release of children 
for wage-earning occupations. In 1916 the committee on retrench- 
ment in the public expenditure stated in its report that: 
There is a special difficulty in economizing on educational expenditure, as 
there is a feeling in many quarters that educational economies are dangerous 
and may in the long run be unremunerative. But, nevertheless, we are strongly 
of the opinion that every step should be taken to effect such reductions as are 
possible without a material loss of educational efficiency, and we are glad to 
learn that many education authorities have already taken steps accordingly by 
postponing or reducing capital expenditure on new buildings or alterations 
(which might normally amount to as much as £3,000,000 a year) and expenditure 
on decorations, repairs, furniture, apparatus, stationery, etc. Similar steps 
should, in our opinion, be taken by all authorities without delay. 
The committee’s recommendation that children under 5 should be 
excluded from school, and that the age of entrance should be raised 
to 6, does not appear to have been effectual, since during the war more 
than ever before mothers who were compelled to enter some form of 
employment needed some place in which to leave their young children. 
The Board of Education and many local authorities suspended much 
of the clerical and statistical work, reduced the amount of inspection, 
and, wherever possible, prevented overlapping of functions between 
the central and local bodies. But with the best intentions it was 
inevitable that the cost of education should increase, owing to the 
necessity of increasing salaries partly to cope with the increased cost 
of living and partly to keep teachers within the profession. Evening 
schools and classes were closed, but the amount saved here was offset 
by the increased attendance in secondary schools and educational 
activities called for in connection with the war. For the present 
there are available only the figures showing the expenditure of the 
national treasury. These indicate a constant but unequal rise, and 
it may be safely concluded that the local authorities spent at least as 
much again on education.

1 Based on the Statesman’s Yearbook. Estimates have been chosen because they afford a better basis 
of comparison up to date than the incomplete reports of expenditures. 
2 Actual grants at the end of the year. 
It will be noticed that the expenditures show a tendency to in- 
crease. The drop in 1916-17 was due to certain retrenchments in the 
administration of the Board of Education office, to the closing of 
sonee training colleges, to the reduction of evening schools and classes, 
to the decrease in the number of children receiving free meals, and 
to the suspension of the special grant to universities and colleges. 
The striking rise in the estimates for 1917-18 was due mainly to the 
addition of about $18,000,000 to the grants to be devoted primarily to 
the increase of teachers’ salaries throughout the country. It is also 
partly accounted for by the extraordinary grant-in-aid of about 
$5,000,000 to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, 
which was not renewed in the estimates for 1918-19 and accounts for 
the decrease for that year. The finances here discussed do not as 
yet show the effect of the act passed in August, 1918, which may in 
time more than double the share of educational expenditure borne 
by the national treasury. Some of the new burdens assumed since 
the outbreak of the war, but as yet not exerting much influence, are 
as follows: Half the cost of maintaining adequate schemes for medi- 
cal treatment; half the cost of evening play centers, schools for 
mothers, and nursery schools; half the cost of salaries for trained 
organizers and supervisors of physical training and games; increased 
grants to secondary schools for general purposes and for approved 
advanced courses; the increased cost of pensions to teachers already 
retired, which were raised in 1918 by almost 50 per cent; and the pay- 
ment of the pensions granted under the superannuation act, 1918. 
The directions of future increase in the national expenditure for 
education are indicated by the promise of the new act. The Board 
of Education will pay grants equal to half of the local expenditure, 
which will show a rapid rise in numerous directions—the further ex- 
pansion of medical inspection and treatment, the introduction of ad- 
vanced work in elementary schools, increased provisions for secondary 
schools and higher education, the establishment of continuation school:, 
increased extra-curricular activities in connection with all types 0°

  schools, and the adoption of new scales of salaries for teachers based 
on a minimum considerably higher than that which prevailed before 
the war, and a maximum from 50 per cent to 100 per cent higher 
than the present and within the reasonable reach of most teachers. 
Consideration has not yet been given to the extension of technical 
education, the improvement of the training of teachers, and the in- 
creasing needs of the universities. Mr. Lloyd George at least inti- 
mated to a deputation representing the interests of the University of 
Wales that the treasury would consider an increase of State aid to 
universities. 
The vast and unproductive expenditure demanded for the conduct 
of the war has awakened the country to a realization of its tremen- 
dous financial strength. The solidarity essential to the war has 
developed a National and State consciousness that has perhaps lain 
dormant hitherto. The revelation of the extent of her social defects 
has turned the attention of the nation to the desirability of dedicating 
the financial strength of the State to the task of reconstruction. 
After the war England is likely to present to the world an example 
of a nation that fosters, encourages, and subsidizes local development 
in all directions without interfering with the initiative and variety 
of experimentation that are of the very essence of progress in a democ- 
racy. Standards will, of course, be maintained, but only the minimum 
will be insisted upon by the State; uniformity will no doubt be 
required in carrying out the minimum standards, but for the rest 
local authorities and private bodies will be allowed free scope for 
development. Nothing that has occurred during the war has shaken 
the English faith in the principle of freedom in local government; 
but the war has had the effect of arousing that sense of responsibility 
and the social conscience that are the corollaries of freedom. No 
better illustration of this can be found than the history of the Fisher 
bill, which began its career in Parliament in August, 1917. 
MEDICAL INSPECTION OF SCHOOLS.' 
in an admirable report, which like its predecessors may well serve 
as a model of what 2 public educational report should be, the chief 
medical officer of the Board of Education presents an account of 
the progress of the school medical service during 1916, and continues 
to emphasize the importance of this work, not merely for the physical 
and intellectual welfare of the children concerned, but as the founda- 
tion for social progress. While the war has interfered in no small 
degree with the complete working of medical inspection and treat- 
ment, it has had the effect of emphasizing the importance of the child 
as a national asect.

18 BIENNIAL SURVEY, OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  The future and strength of the nation unquestionably depend upon the 
vitality of the child, upon his health and development, and upon his education 
and equipment for citizenship. Great and far-reaching issues have their 
origin and some of their inspiration in him. Yet in a certain though narrow 
sense everything depends upon his physique. If that be sound, we have the rock 
upon which a nation and a race may be built; if that be impaired, we lack 
that foundation and build on the sand. It would be difficult to overestimate the 
volume of national inefficiency, of unfitness and suffering, of unnecessary ex- 
penditure, and of industrial unrest and unemployability to which this country 
consents because of its relative failure to rear and to educate a healthy, virile, 
and well-equipped race of children and young people. There is no investment 
comparable to this, no national economy so fundamental; there is also no waste 
so irretrievable as that of a nation which is careless of its rising generation. 
And the goal is not an industrial machine, a technical workman, a ‘“ hand,” 
available merely for the increase of material output, and the acquisition of a 
wage at the earliest moment, but a human personality, well grown and ready 
in body and mind, able to work, able to play, a good citizen, the healthy parent 
of a future generation. If these things be true, as I believe they are, no re- 
construction of the State can wisely ignore the claims of the child. 
The national belief in the value of school medical inspection and 
treatment is best indicated by the efforts to maintain them in spite 
of the inroads made by the war emergency on the supply of doctors 
and nurses. The result of an experience of less than 10 years since 
the system was established as part of the school system is summarized 
in the following statements: 
To-day hundreds of thousands of children are healthier, better, and brighter 
for its labors. In large towns and small country villages there has arisen 
something of a new understanding of the child. He is coming steadily into his 
kingdom, into his individual birthright of health and well-being. Even in time 
of war, when the preoccupation and exigencies of the military situation have 
made exceptional demands upon the staff of persons, officials or voluntary, 
who have devoted themselves hitherto to the welfare of the child, the claims of 
the school medical service have been sufficiently valid and obvious to secure 
the maintenance of an irreducible minimum of its working. 
So great is the value attached to school medical inspection that 
its extension voluntarily to secondary schools has been encouraged 
in recent years and has been assured by the new act both for secondary 
and continuation schools. 
The full operation of the act and regulations bearing on medical 
inspection requires four inspections of children—at entrance, in the 
third and the sixth year of school life, and at the time of leaving 
school. Owing to the curtailment resulting from the war, provision 
was made in 1915 and 1916 only for the inspection and treatment of 
ehildren who appeared to be ailing and for the maintenance of any 
treatment already undertaken. Of the 5,306,411 children in average 
attendance, 1,446,448 were medically examined in 1916, instead of 
the two millions who would normally have received attention. In 
spite of this decrease the total expenditure on the school medical 
service amounted to $2,089,350, an increase of 28 per cent over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 19 
expenditure for 1913-14. Approximately half of the cost was met 
by grants from the central authority. The scope of the work is in- 
dicated in the employment of 772 school medical officers and assist- 
ants and 441 medical officers employed on such special work as 
ophthalmic surgery, aural surgery, dental surgery, X-ray work, 
and administration of anesthetics. The medical officers were assisted 
by 1,527 school nurses, and in a number of areas arrangements were 
made with local nursing associations for the services of their nurses. 
Since the work was limited to ailing children, the burden of dis- 
covering children who appeared to need medical attention fell upon 
the teachers, who have always cooperated heartily in the work since 
its establishment, and in a number of areas memoranda were issued 
by the school medical officers for their guidance. The following 
outline, drawn up by Dr. J. T. C. Nash, of Norfolk, should be of serv- 
ice to teachers interested in school hygiene: 
* Routine school medical inspection being in abeyance, the following notes have 
been drawn up by the school medical officer to guide teachers in detecting some 
defects, which should secure amelioration. The attention of the local care com- 
mittee should be called to any cases discovered, so that they may be “ followed 
up”; particulars should also be sent to this office: 
I. Defective eyesight may be suspected when a child— 
(1) In a back row can not read what is written en the b'ackhoard, 
(2) Can not tell the time by the clock at a little distance. 
(3) Fails to keep to the lines when writing. 
(4) Misses small words when reading. 
(5) Habitually holds a book nearer to the eyes than 12 inches when 
reading. 
(6) Complains that the letters run into one another. 
(7) Squints, even if only occasionally. 
(8) Complains of tiredness of the eyes or of frontal headache after 
reading or sewing. 
II. Defective hearing is often present when ‘a child— 
(1) Is a mouth breather. . 
(2) Has a “running” ear, 
(8) Looks stupid and does not answer questions addressed in an 
ordinary voice, though otherwise intelligent. 
Such a child should be tested for deafness by a forced 
whisper, beginning at 20 feet and gradually lessening the dis- 
tance until the “forced whisper” is heard, Report the distance 
at which this is heard. 
III. Inflammation of the eyelids, with scabs or discharge from the eyes, 
should receive attention from a doctor. 
IV. Earache. This should always receive attention from a doctor. 
V. Gumboils. These should receive attention from a qualified dentist. 
VI. Enlarged tonsils and adenoids may be suspected when a child— 
(1) Is stated to snore or breathes noisily during sleep or when eating. 
(2) Is a mouth breather—open mouth. 
(8) Is frequently troubled with nasal discharge, 
(4) Becomes deaf when it has a cold,
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
VII. Loss of flesh and frequent cough should receive attention from a doctor. 
These symptoms may be due to many different causes and are by no 
means peculiar to consumption. 
VIII. Heart disease should be suspected if a child— 
(1) Is always pale. 
(2) Has palpitation and shortness of breath on exertion. 
(3) Is blue in the face. 
IX. Rheumatism., Children who often have sore throats and “ growing pains” 
should be suspected of rheumatism. They require to see a doctor. 
An important conclusion that has resulted from the experience of 
the last 10 years is the emphasis “on the fact that the problem of 
school attendance is, in the main, a medical problem.” Since the 
teachers and school attendance officers have cooperated closely with 
the medical service, the number of absences from school for causes 
other than medical has decreased, while the average percentage of 
school attendance has increased. This situation has necessitated the 
development of a new type of attendance officer and the suggestion is 
put forward that “the most suitable visitor to send to the home of a 
child absent from school on alleged medical grounds is a woman 
health officer,” who would be in a better position than an attendance 
officer to discover the nature of the ailment and to advise the parents. 
In the Borough of Taunton, where no men attendance officers have 
been employed for the past five years, there was an increase in the 
percentage of average attendance, and a decrease in the number of ab- 
sences on grounds other than medical and in the frequency of prose- 
cutions. 
Not the least valuable part of the work of the school medical serv- 
ices has been the number of special inquiries, which were begun in 
1909 and of which 350 have been made. These, as their titles indi- 
cate, are of great practical value not merely for the medical service 
itself but also for teachers and principals of schools. Many studies 
conducted in this country by the departments of school administra- 
tion have been undertaken in England by the school medical officers. 
The only studies in England on retardation, for example, have re- 
sulted from such inquiries.* 
Although the school medical inspection has necessarily been cur- 
tailed, the provision of medical treatment showed some progress even 
during the war. Of the 319 local education authorities, 219 had 
established 480 school clinics, all of which are extensively used. The 
more progressive authorities, like Birmingham, Bradford, and Shef- 
field, have provided comprehensive schemes with clinics available for 
medical inspection, and the treatment of minor ailments, teeth, skin, 
and X-ray operations, eyes, ears, and tuberculosis. A number of 
authorities cooperate with hospitals either as a supplement to or as a

author's attention after this was written.

substitute for school clinics. Considering the immense importance 
of medical treatment in the scheme of a school medical service, it was 
found that the provision was still inadequate, and in 1917 the main- 
tenance of an adequate system of medical treatment was made one of 
the conditions of the grant paid by the Board of Education. Accord- 
ing to the latest regulations the standards of an efficient scheme of 
school medical service, on the basis of which a grant will be paid at 
the rate of one-half of the expenditure, are as follows: Arrangements 
must be made for the medical inspection of the four groups referred 
to above, for following up cases of defect and securing medical 
treatment where necessary, for coordinating the work of the school 
medical service with the work of the local public health service, and 
for rendering the school medical service an integral part of the sys- 
tem of elementary education. The whole tenor of the report is to 
emphasize the preventive aspect both of medical inspection and of 
medical treatment. 
To provide spectacles, to excise adenoids, to cleanse verminous children, to 
extract decayed teeth is good but not the best. It is part but not the whole. 
It is palliative but not preventive. It is imperative im the time of recon- 
struction lying before us that we should turn off the tap as we!l as remove the 
flood, that we should stop the production of disease and prevent what is pre- 
ventable. ; 
‘The national value of the medical service which is now in its tenth 
year of operation is shown by the improved health of the older chil- 
dren. “It is significant,” says the report, “that while the health and 
personal condition of entrants shows little or no betterment, that of 
8-year-old and leaving children shows a steady improvement” in 
clothing, nutrition, and cleanliness of head and body. Fortunately 
there has been a continuance of good health during the period of the 
war as a result of the improved economic conditions; there have been 
fewer cases of malnutrition and insufficient clothing than in previous 
years. But that the situation is not yet one for congratulation may 
be gathered from the fact that: ; 
The records of its findings (of the school medical service) show a large 
amount of ill-health, of bodily impairment, and of physical and mental defect 
* * *, Of the children in attendance at school (six millions) we know 
by medical inspection that many, though not specifically “ feeble-minded,” are 
so dull and backward mentally as to be unable to benefit from schooling, that 
upward of 10 per cent of the whole are at a like disability on account of un- 
cleanliness, and that 10 per cent also are malnourished. Then we come’ to 
disease, Perhaps the largest contributor is dental disease, which handicaps 
children almost as seriously as it does adolescents and adults. Probably not 
less than half the children are in need of dental treatment, and a substantial 
number (not less than half a million) are urgently so. Again, upward of half 
a million children are so defective in eyesight as to be unable to take ad- 
vantage of their lessons. Many of them need spectacles, some ophthalmic treat- 
ment, others special “ myopic classes,’ and all of them careful supervision and  
-P-A-G-E-22
    22 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
attention. Next we must add diseases of the ear, throat, and lymphatic glands 
involving another quarter of a million in a relatively serious condition. Then 
there come skin diseases, disorders of the heart, infectious disease, and tuber- 
culosis. 
The recognition of these facts, serious though they are, represents 
the awakening of a national conscience, which “ finds its origin partly 
in the fuller appreciation of the importance of saving life, and partly 
in a larger understanding of the necessity of preserving and equipping 
the life we have.” 
How extensive ‘the ramifications of a national system of school 
medical service are is indicated by the attention given in the report 
to all those agencies and activities essential to its successful operation. 
Extensive as the list of these agencies is, it can be supplemented by 
welfare supervisors, probation officers, children’s care committees, 
juvenile employment committees, scoutmasters, leaders of boys’ and 
girls’ clubs and brigades, to whom only passing reference is made. 
The safeguarding and protection of early child life may be pro- 
moted by the training of mothers in prenatal and infant care and 
management, the foundations for which may be laid in lessons in 
mothercraft to the older girls in the elementary schools. Under regu- 
lations of the Board of Education, issued in September, 1918, grants 
will be made to efficient schools for mothers at the rate of one-half of 
the approved expenditure. Day nurseries, créches, and nursery 
schools are important cooperative factors in preserving the health of 
young children in the preschool period, particularly in crowded urban 
and industrial districts. Their importance has been recognized by 
the payment of grants-in-aid up to 50 per cent of the cost of main- 
tenance by the Board of Education and more recently in the act by 
the incorporation of nursery schools in the national system of educa- 
tion. ‘The purpose of nursery schools is not to teach the three R’s, 
but by sleep, food, and play to provide the opportunity for little 
children to lay the foundations of health, habit, and a responsive 
personality.” For the children of elementary school age medical 
inspection and treatment must, in the words of the report, be sup- 
plemented by— 
(a) the feeding of the child, by the parent or under the education (provision of 
meals) act, or otherwise; (b) the supply of fresh air for the child by means of 
open-air schools, playground classes, or adequately ventilated schoolrooms; 
(c) the exercise of the child’s body by the adoption of an effective system of 
physical training; (d@) the warmth and protection of the child, by requiring that 
it shall be sent to school properly clothed and that the schoolroom is sufficiently 
heated; and (c) the maintenance of the cleanliness of the child, by insuring 
that dirty and verminous children do not contaminate clean children at school, 
and that for the school itself bath and lavatory accommodation is available. 
All of these agencies are now more or less adequately provided. 
A significant fact refuting the fears that the public provision of meals
-P-A-G-E-23
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 23. 
would pauperize the parents is the decrease in the number of children 
receiving free meals from 422,401 in 1914-15, a large figure due to the 
industrial disorganization consequent on the outbreak of the war, 
to 117,901 in 1915-16 and 63,939 in 1916-17. Open-air schools are 
supplemented by classes conducted in playgrounds, parks, and open’ 
spaces, by school journeys, holiday and night camps, and open-air 
classrooms. The war has had a special influence in drawing atten- 
tion to the value of life in the open air, and its extension is to be pro- 
moted and encouraged under the new act. To stimulate the further 
development of physical training, play, and games, the board in 1917 
undertook to meet half the cost of the salaries of trained organizers 
and supervisors of these subjects and half the cost of maintaining 
evening play and recreation centers for children and young persons. 
Finally, to insure cleanliness, many schools are providing for school 
baths and showers in new buildings—an addition that is inexpensive 
The twofold aim of the school medical service—to enable the child 
through improved physique to benefit from instruction in school and 
to lay the foundations for the physical well-being of the nation—finds 
expression throughout the report. One of the most serious menaces 
to the success of this work is found in the engagement of children 
on leaving school in employments dangerous to their health. For this 
reason emphisis is placed on the medical inspection of children imme- 
diately before leaving school on the basis of which advice can be given 
on the choice of employment. 
The physical injury (of a wrong choice) which manifests itself is insidious 
and inconspicuous but far-reaching. Malnutrition, anemia, fatigue, spinal cur- 
vature, and strain of heart or nervous system are conditions the discovery of 
which generally calls for clinical investigation and careful inquiry. They do 
not catch the eye or arrest the attention of the casual observer. But they are 
profoundly important for two reasons; they lay the foundations of disease, and 
they undermine the physiological growth of the child at a critical juncture in 
life. * * * It is the conditions rather than the character of employment 
which tend to injure the child. 
Such conditions will no doubt’ be improved by the restriction im- 
posed on child labor by the new act and the extension of the medical 
service to embrace pupils in secondary and continuation schools. The 
last provision closes the gap which existed hitherto between the medi- 
cal inspection of children in the elementary school and the protection 
of wage earners under the National Health Insurance Act. 
As soon as normal conditions are again restored, England will have 
established the broadest and most far-reaching system of health super- 
vision, one that will affect every member of the povulation. Begin- 
ning with the maternity centers and unifying all the agencies both 
public and private for the promotion of health through childhood, 
adolescence, and beyond, the system will not only give every child 
a better chance of surviving but will through improved measures pro- 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    24 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
mote the physical and thereby the intellectual and spiritual well-being 
of the nation. The next few years will not only see the extension of 
the program in the schools but the application of the lessons of the 
war to industry. New light has been thrown on the relations between 
‘health and economic production that will prove as significant and far- 
reaching as the experience of the school medical service during the 
past 10 years. 
In this country, where only a beginning has been made with the 
medical inspection and treatment of school children, parents, teachers, 
medical profession, and organizations for social service can have no 
better lesson brought to their attention than England’s example. For 
those interested in establishing national standards of health there can 
be no more profitable subject for study than the irreducible minimum 
of a school medical service presented in the report here discussed : 
(1) That every child shall periodically come under direct medical and dental 
supervision, and if found defective shall be “ followed up.” 
(II) That every child found malnourished shall, somehow or other, be 
nourished, and every child found verminous shall, somehow or other, 
be cleansed, 
(III) ‘That for every sick, diseased, or defective child, skilled medical treatment 
shall be made available, either by the local education authority or 
otherwise, 
(IV) That every child shall be educated in a well-ventilated \schoolroom or 
classrom, or in some form of open-air schoolroom or classroom, 
(V) That every child shall have, daily, organized physical exercise of appro- 
priate character. 
(VI) That no child of school age shall be employed for profit except under 
approved conditions. 
(VII) That the school environment and the means of education shall be such as 
can in no case exert unfavorable or injurious influences upon the 
health, growth, and development of the child. 
EDUCATION OF WORKING BOYS AND GIRLS. 
The departmental committee on juvenile education in relation to 
employment after the war was appointed by Mr. Arthur Henderson, 
then president of the Board of Education, in April, 1916— 
To consider what steps should be taken to make provision for the education and 
instruction of children and young persons after the war, regard being had 
particularly to the interests of those (1) who have been abnormally employed 
during the war; (2) who can not immediately find advantageous employ- 
ment; (3) who require special training for employment. \ 
The committee of 16 members, representing educational adminis- 
tration, social workers, and the teaching profession, met under the 
chairmanship of the Right Hon. J. Herbert Lewis, and issued its 
report, generally known as the Lewis Report* in March, 1917. The

committee took the evidence of a large number of representatives of 
industry and commerce, labor and education. 
The committee recognized that their problem was really “ the 
standing problem of the adolescent wage earners,” similar to that 
which the consultative committee had considered and upon which a 
report upon attendance at continuation schools had been issued in 
1909. On the basis of statistics for 1911 it was found that, of 650,000 
children between 12 and 13 enrolled in public full-time day schools 
(elementary, secondary, junior, and technical), only 13 per cent are 
likely to have a full-time education after the age of 14, and that this 
number would dwindle to less than 1 per cent between the ages of 17 
and 18. Of about 2,700,000 young persons between the ages of 14 and 
_ 18 in 1911-12 about 81.5 per cent were not attending any kind of 
school, and of the remainder very few completed the annual courses 
for which they registered in evening schools. The decline of appren- 
ticeship, the development of a large number -of initially attractive 
but ultimately blind-alley occupations, the increased industrial op- 
portunities created for young persons by the war demands, together 
with high wages and relaxed discipline and control, all combined to 
bring about a serious situation for the country, which would be inten- 
sified by the inevitable dislocation of industries at the close of the 
war. The solution of the problem demanded a new outlook. 
Can the age of adolescence be brought out of the purview of economic ex- 
ploitation and into that of the social conscience? Can the conception of the 
juvenile as primarily a little wage earner be replaced by the conception of the 
juvenile as primarily the workman and the citizen in training? Can it be 
established that the educational purpose is to be the dominating one, without 
as well within the school doors, during those formative years between 12 
and 18? 
The committee strongly urged the raising of the elementary school 
age to 14 without any exemptions whatever and compulsory attend- 
ance at a day continuation school between the ages of 14 and 18 for 8 
hours a week for 40 weeks in the year. Broken terms both on enter- 
ing and leaving school should be avoided by having definite times in 
the year for each. Criticizing the work of the elementary schools, 
the committee found that too frequently pupils in upper grades were 
merely marking time, and recommended the introduction of more 
practical education in place of the prevalent bookish type. “No 
child should feel on leaving school that he has attained to the fully 
independent status of wage-earning manhood.” In defining the 
scope of the work to be offered in a continuation school the committee 
urged the postponement of specialization to the last two years 
(16 to 18), the first two years (14 to 16) being general in character. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
We do not regard the object of establishing continuation classes as being 
merely an industrial one. The industries stand to benefit amply enough, both 
directly through the beginnings of technical instruction and indirectly through 
the effect of education upon the character and the general efficiency of those 
who come within its influence. But we are clear that the business of the 
classes is to do what they can in making a reasonable human being and a 
citizen, and that, if they do this, they will help to make a competent workman 
also. Though this is wholly true, it is also true that education must be ap- 
proached, especially at the adolescent stage, through the actual interests of 
the pupil, and that the actual interests of pupils who have just turned a corner 
in life and entered upon wage-earning employment are very largely the new 
interests which their employment has opened out to them. 
Local adaptation would accordingly be essential in both stages of 
the four-year course, with a vocational bias and a number of alterna- 
tive courses. In the second stage some emphasis might be placed 
upon technical subjects bearing on the students’ special work. 
A liberal basis is still essential, and the English teaching should now tend 
toward a deliberate stimulation of the sense of citizenship * * *. Music, art, 
local history, home industries, first-aid, natural history, will all afford an oppor- 
tunity for the skillful teacher, and can be treated suitably both for boys and 
girls. 
Physical training should form part of the work of all adolescents 
for not less than one hour a week. Over and above the studies the 
continuation schools should become centers for the social and physical 
activities of the adolescent boy and girl; schools should be open in 
the evenings for recreation and games, and should be available for 
clubs, debating and other societies, study circles, concerts, and other 
organizations. 
The committee did not feel that any opposition would be encoun- 
tered by its proposals; parents were beginning to realize that the 
advantage would be in favor of the child, while employers were 
recognizing their responsibilities and the value of education, and 
the suggestions were warranted by the success of experiments in 
“works” schools. Assuming that the plan could be inaugurated 
in 1921, there would be about 2,600,000 pupils between 14 and 18 
needing the service of some 32,000 teachers. The cost would be 
from $35,000,000 to $45,000,000 a year, without including the cost of 
providing buildings. 
So far as young persons Who had entered industrial life prema- 
turely because of the war demands for labor were concerned, the 
committee suggests the possibility of providing special courses and 
the opening of technical schools as well as for those who might be 
thrown out of employment as a result of the dislocation of industries 
that might be expected to follow the war. The committee empha- 
sized the new opportunities and responsibilities of juvenile employ-
-P-A-G-E-27

ment bureaus at this particular crisis. The Board of Kducation, 
cooperating with the Ministry of Labor, issued a circular (No. 1072) 
in November, 1918, urging local education authorities to establish 
centers for the educational supervision of young persons who might 
be thrown out of work at the cessation of hostilities. It is proposed 
that the Government unemployment grants, payable to young persons 
between 15 and 18, be made conditional on attendance at such in- 
structional centers. 
The recommendations are summarized in the report under the 
following headings: 
(1) That a uniform elementary school-leaving age of 14 be established by 
statute for all districts, urban and rural, and that all exemptions, total or 
partial, from compulsory attendance below that age be abolished. 
(2) That a child be deemed to attain the leaving age on that one of a reason- 
able number of fixed dates in the year, marking the ends of school terms, which 
falls next after the date upon which he reaches 14. 
(3) That steps be taken, by better stafling and other improvements in the 
upper classes of elementary schools, to insure the maximum benefit from the 
last years, of school life. 
(4) That difficulties of poverty be met in other ways than by regarding 
poverty as a reasonable excuse for nonattendance in interpreting section 74 
of the education act of 1870. 
(5) That the factory acts be amended in accordance with the amended law 
of school attendance, and that the law of school attendance be consolidated. 
(6) That the Board of Education and the Home Office do consider the de- 
sirability of transferring the work of certifying as to the physical fitness of 
children for employment under the factory acts to the school medical officers. 
(7) That it be an obligation on the local education authority in each area 
to provide suitable continuation classes for young persons between the aves of 
14 and 18, and to submit to the Board of Education a plan for the organization 
of such a system, together with proposals for putting it into effect. 
(8) That it be an obligation upon all young persons between 14 and 18 years 
of age to attend such day continuation classes as may be prescribed for them 
by the local education authority, during a number of hours to be fixed by 
statute, which should be not less than 8 hours a week for 40 weeks in the 
year, with the exception of— 
(a) Those who are under efficient full-time instruction in some other man- 
ner. 
(b) Those who have completed a satisfactory course in a secondary school 
recognized as efficient by the Board of Education and are not: less than 16: 
(c) Those who have passed the matriculation examination of a British uni- 
versity, or an equivalent examination, and are not less than 16, 
(d) Those who are under part-time instruction of a kind not regarded as un- 
suitable by the Board of Education and entailing a substantially greater amount 
of study in the daytime than the amount to be required by statute. 
(9) That during the first year from the establishment of this system the 
obligation to attend classes extend to those young persons only who are under 
15, during the second year to those only who are under 16, during the third 
year to those only who are under 17, and subsequently to all those who are 
under 18. 
(10) That all classes at which attendance is compulsory be held between 
the hours of 8 a, m. and 7 p. m.
-P-A-G-E-28
28 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
(11) That it be an obligation on all employers of young persons under 18 
to give them the necessary facilities for attendance at the statutory continua- 
tion classes prescribed for them by the local education authority. 
(12) That where there is already a statutory limitation upon the hours of 
labor, the permitted hours of labor be reduced by the number of those required 
for the continuation classes. 
(18) That in suitable cases the young persons be liable to a penalty for 
nonattendance; and that the parent or the employer be also liable in so far 
as any act or omission on his part is the cause of failure in attendance. 
(14) That the local administration of the employment of children act of 1903 
‘be transferred to the local education authorities; that it be an obligation on 
every local education authority to make by-laws under the act; that the statu- 
tory provisions of the act be extended; and that the Board of Education be 
the central authority for the approval of by-laws under the act. 
(15) That the curriculum of the continuation classes include general, prac- 
tical, and technical instruction, and that provision be made for continuous 
physical training and for medical inspection, and for clinical treatment where 
necessary, up to the age of 18. 
(16) That suitable courses of training be established and adequate salaries 
be provided for teachers of continuation classes. 
(17) That the system of continuation classes come normally into operation 
on an appointed day as early as possible after the end of the war, and that the 
Board of Education have power to make deferring orders fixing later appointed 
days within a limited period, where necessary, for the whole or part of the 
area of any local education authority. 
(18) That the obligation to attend continuation classes be extended to chil- 
dren who are under 14 when the act comes into operation, although they may 
already have left the day school. . 
(19) That the attention of local education authorities be drawn to the pos- 
sibility in certain cases of providing special full-time courses for children and 
young persons who have been abnormally employed. 
(20) That in areas where maintenance allowances from public funds are 
available for the relief of unemployed young persons after the war, attendance 
at any classes that may be established for such young persons be a condition 
of relief. 
(21) That the system of juvenile employment bureaus be strengthened and 
extended before the termination of the war, and that further financial assist- 
ance be given to local education for their maintenance. 
(22) That in areas where there is probability of juvenile unemployment, 
teachers and other suitable persons explain to children and their parents the 
difficulties of obtaining work and the advantages of prolonged attendance at 
school. ‘ 
(23) That the State grants in aid of present as well as future expenditure 
on education be simplified and very substantially increased. 
The recommendations of this committee attracted widespread at- 
tention; comparison with the education act will indicate that most 
of these suggestions have been incorporated, that, indeed, the report 
of the committee furnished the general framework for the act.

  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 29 
SECONDARY EDUCATION DURING THE WAR, 
The outstanding features in the field of secondary education are 
the increase in the number of pupils and the revived interest in the 
purposes and functions of higher education. There is perhaps no 
problem in the whole range of education that has been more minutely 
criticized and discussed than that of the place of the secondary 
school in a democracy and the nature of the education that it should 
provide. The increase of opportunities in which all may have their 
share is the keynote of the discussions on one side; on the other, a 
clear-cut definition of the boundary that separates general from 
specialized, technical, or vocational education is made. The demands 
that will be made in the new social order upon the trained intelli- 
gence of the citizen, whether as a member of society or as a member 
of a trade or profession or as an individual, are accepted as the 
proper measure of educational values. The unanimity with which 
these have been accepted by specialists, officials, statesmen, and the 
average citizen may furnish food for reflection to those who are 
concerned with the task of unraveling the tangle in which secondary 
education is at present involved in this country. The experiments 
that the two great democracies on each side of the Atlantic are mak- 
ing in this common effort to promote human progress are fraught 
with profound significance. 
In striking contrast. to this country, where the effect of the war 
has been to cause a reduction in the attendance at high schools, the 
increased prosperity in England has led to a considerable increase in 
the enrollment in secondary schools and an improvement in the 
length of school life. So great has been the pressure that in many 
areas schools are overcrowded, and many have a waiting list. Since 
the building of new schools has been stopped, and since a few are still 
under military occupation, overcrowding is accepted as inevitable, 
and the Board of Education has been compelled to relax the rules as 
to size of classes. At the same time the number of teachers absent on 
military service or war work has contributed to increase the difficul- 
ties, which have been met by ‘the employment of women teachers in 
boys’ schools and of such additional men as were available. “But the 
withdrawal from the schools of their younger and more vigorous mas- 
ters, and their replacement by others of lower physique, of more ad- 
vanced years, and often of inferior qualification, is an educational 
loss for which there can be no effective compensation.” The schools 
have participated extensively in war work. Of the 1,056 schools on 
the board’s list of efficient schools, 894 have given effective help in 
food production, in harvesting, and in producing details of munitior 
plants and of hospital equipment.

1 Statisties are not available since 1914-15 for the number in the schools not on the grant list._ ‘The fig- ures here given are based on an assumption of an increase of 10 per cent over the figures for 1914-15. . 
During 1917 the Board of Education issued new regulations for 
secondary schools in England increasing the State aid to schools on 
its grant list and making provision for additional grants to schools 
developing advanced courses for students above the age of 16 who 
might be desirous of specializing in certain subjects. Separate regu- 
lations were issued for Wales, more suitable to its special conditions 
and, while maintaining the same general standards of efficiency, 
‘basing the grants on an age-range of pupils from 12 to 18 instead 
of 10 to 18 as in England. Grants are also made payable for the 
encouragement of experimental or pioneer work. To qualify for \ 
the grant, schools must, besides submitting to inspection and offering 
a certain proportion of free places to pupils entering from elementary , 
schools, provide a progressive course of general education of a kind | 
and amount suitable for pupils of an age-range at least as wide as 
from 12 to 17. An adequate proportion of the pupils must remain 
in school at least four years and up to and beyond the age of 16; 
these figures are subject to modification in rural areas. The grants, 
based on enrollment at the beginning of each school year, are 
increased mainly “to secure a higher standard of efficiency in the 
schools, and in particular to enable them to provide more adequate 
remuneration for the teaching staff.” The consideration of the whole 
question of salaries of teachers in secondary schools was intrusted 
to a departmental committee for inquiring into the principles which 
should determine the fixing of salaries and technical schools, schools 
of art, training colleges, and other institutions for higher education. 
For the present no definite requirements are imposed as to -qualifi- 
cations and training, except that “where the board think fit, they 
may, on consideration of the teaching staff as a whole, require that 
a certain proportion of all new appointments shall consist of persons 
who have gone through a course of training recognized by the board 
+See pp. 611, 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  EDUCATION IN GREAT. BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 31 
for the purpose.” Revised regulations’ were issued in 1915 for the 
training of teachers in secondary schools, but conditions have not 
been favorable to their enforcement. The regulations recognize 
three methods of training teachers for secondary schools: (1) The 
first, in which a training college or university training department 
assumes the whole responsibility for instruction in both theory and 
practice of education. (2) The second, in which the training college 
is responsible for instruction in theory of education and an approved 
secondary school assumes the responsibility for training in practice. 
(8) The third, in which training in both theory and practice is given 
in an approved secondary school by one or more qualified members 
of the staff. In each case no candidates may be admitted to the 
course of training of one year except after graduation from a uni- 
versity. 
For purposes of recognition as an efficient secondary school the 
board requires that the curriculum shall meet with its approval and 
“provide for due continuity of instruction in each of the subjects 
taken, and for an adequate amount of time being given to each of 
these subjects.” 
  The curriculum must provide instruction in the English language and litera- 
ture, at least one language other than English, geography, history, mathematics, 
science, and drawing. A curriculum including two languages other than English, 
but making no provision for instruction in Latin, will only be approved where 
the board are satisfied that the omission of Latin is for the educational advan- 
tage of the school. The instruction in science must include practical work by 
the pupils. 
The curriculum must make such provision as the board, having regard to the 
circumstances of the school, can accept as adequate for organized games, 
physical exercises, manual instruction, and singing. 
In schools for girls the curriculum must include provision for practical in- 
struction in domestic subjects, such as needlework, cookery, laundry work, 
housekeeping, and household hygiene; and an approved course in a combination 
of these subjects may for girls over 15 years of age be substituted partially or ~ 
wholly for science and for mathematics other than arithmetic. 
By special permission of the’ board, languages other than English may be 
omitted from the curriculum, provided that the board are satisfied that the in- 
struction in English provides special and adequate linguistic and literary train- 
ing, and that the teaching staff are qualified to give such instructon. 
  At present the majority of pupils remain in school up to about the 
age of 16. There is a consensus of opinion, as will be pointed out 
later, that a course of general education consisting of the subjects 
here mentioned shall extend from about 12 to 16. In the regulations 
for 1917-18 the Board of Education recommended the development 
of advanced courses for pupils who intended to go on to the univer- 
sities and other places for higher education and research as well as

those who planned to proceed to commerce and industry. It was 
thought that such opportunities for specialization would serve as in- 
ducements to boys and girls to remain in the secondary schools be- 
yond the age of 16. The suggestions contained in these regulations 
were subjected to criticism and are issued in their revised form in 
the regulations for 1918-19. The advanced courses will be founded 
upon the general education offered to boys and girls up to 16 and 
will consist of specialization for two years on a group of coordi- 
nated subjects along those lines in which a pupil has already shown 
ability. “In every course there must be a substantial and coherent 
body of work taken by all pupils and occupying a predominant part 
of their time, the remainder being given to some additional subjects.” 
Three groups of subjects are contemplated : “(A) Science and mathe- 
matics; (B) classics, viz, the civilization of the ancient world as em- 
bodied in the languages, literature, and history of Greece and Rome; 
and (C) modern studies, viz, the languages, literature, and history of 
the countries of western Europe in modern and medieval times.” 
The courses are further defined as follows: 
Course A should normally include work in both science and mathematics; but 
this requirement may be waived for pupils who do substantial work in the 
biological sciences if the course is otherwise suitable and includes work reach- 
ing an adequate standard in the physical sciences. 
Course B must provide for all pupils substantial work in the language, litera- 
ture, and history of both Greece and Rome. 
Course C must include the advanced study of one modern foreign western 
European language and literature with the relevant history, together with the 
history of England and Greater Britain. It must also include either the study 
of a second modern foreign language or work of good scope and standard in 
English language and literature. 
In all advanced courses, adequate provision must be made for the study and 
writing of English by every pupil either in connection with the main subjects 
of the course or otherwise. In other respects, full freedom is left in the choice 
and arrangement of additional subjects, so long as the syllabus for an A course 
provides for some substantial work in language, literature, or history, and that 
for a B or © course some substantial work in subjects other than language, 
literature, and history. 
English must be included in all the groups; in group A, the scien- 
tific, work must be offered in language, literature, and history; in 
groups B and C, the linguistic and literary, subjects other than these 
must be provided. The courses will not be rigidly defined; the board 
will, for example, approve courses in ancient history from the Baby- 
lonian era to the complete organization of the Roman Empire in place 
of the history of Greece and Rome, as well as Old and New Testament 
history and the origins of Christianity. In the modern studies group 
it was intended originally to require the inclusion of Latin, but this 
compulsion has new been withdrawn, and at the same time English
-P-A-G-E-33
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 83 
language and literature may be substituted for a second foreign lan- 
guage. The study of the first modern language must be carried to 
the stage where the pupil can use it as an instrument for the study of 
literature and history as well as higher linguistic training. It will 
be noticed that commercial subjects and geography are not provided 
for as separate groups; it is the intention of the board that geography 
be made an essential part of the study of history or be given as an 
additional subject, while commercial studies may be covered under 
the third group. 
Grants of $2,000 a year will be made for each advanced course that 
is approved by the board, and no restriction is placed upon the num- 
ber that a school may organize. The grant is intended for efficient 
staffing and equipment. Up to November, 1917, between 270 and 
_ 280 applications had been made, mainly by schools in large urban 
areas, for the recognition of advanced courses of which more than 
half were in science and mathematics, and about two-thirds of the 
remainder for modern studies. Of the applications, 63 were ap- 
proved in science and mathematics, 13 in classics, and 19 in modern 
languages. 
Considerable criticism has been raised against the introduction of 
advanced courses on the ground that it penalizes the smaller schools, 
where the number of older pupils is as a rule not adequate for the 
organization of special work. It is felt that older pupils who desire 
to specialize will leave the smaller schools for schools where ad- 
vanced work is offered, and it is objected that not only would the 
first schools be deprived of their more able product and of the grants 
for their attendance, but that the withdrawal of those who would nor- 
mally become prefects or leaders would militate against the develop- 
ment of corporate life in the schools, while the transferred pupils 
would find difficulty in adjusting themselves to their new surround- 
ings. It is replied in answer to such objections that the new develop- 
ment of education looks to the effective organization of educational 
facilities in an area and not the treatment of each school in isolation ; 
since the new note is cooperation and not competition, some sacrifices 
must be made. There is much truth in this contention, but there is 
little doubt that the corporate life of some schools may suffer, although 
not quite to the extent claimed by the opponents of the scheme, since 
the withdrawal of older boys would leave a more homogeneous group 
behind. 
The movement for the establishment of advanced courses so closely 
resembles that for the development of junior colleges in this country 
that the parallel need not be pressed. It may be pointed out, how- 
ever, that the general education planned for the four years between 
12 and 16 in England corresponds closely to that provided in Ameri- 
171030°—21—Bull. 89-3 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  34 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
can high schools to pupils between 14 and 18. The necessary conclu- 
sion must be that at the close of the advanced courses at the age of 
18 a pupil in England would certainly have reached the stage of a 
college junior or even of a senior in America, allowing for the fact 
that classes will be small and methods adapted to encourage as rapid 
advancement as possible. The movement is one that deserves the at- 
tention of educators in this country who feel, as many do, that some- 
where on the educational highway two years are lost by the American 
student. : 
The organization of advanced courses and the implications arising 
out of them will contribute in large measure to define the scope of 
the English secondary schools. Closely associated with this problem 
is the vexed question of examinations. The existence in England of 
many examination bodies without unanimity as to standards has for 
a long time exercised a detrimental effect on secondary education. 
In 1911 a report was issued on the subject of the consultative com- 
mittee of the Board of Education, and in the following year the 
board? prepared the outline of a scheme upon which conferences 
were conducted with the universities, examining bodies, and repre- 
sentatives of local education authorities and secondary school teach- 
ers. In July, 1914, the scheme had advanced sufficiently to be sub- 
mitted for further criticism and suggestions from those interested in 
secondary school examinations. This scheme proposed that examin- 
ing bodies appointed by the universities should conduct two examina- 
tions, the first of those classes in secondary schools in which the 
pupils were about the age of 16, and the second at about the age of 
18, with necessary modifications in the case of girls. The first ex- 
amination, it was intended, should test the results of general educa- 
tion in English subjects (English language and literature, history, 
and geography), foreign languages, and science and mathematics, 
and should be of such a standard as to be accepted for entrance to the 
universities. The second examination was directed to test the results 
of specialized study of a coordinated group of subjects combined with 
more general knowledge of subjects outside this group; in other 
words, the results of the advanced courses that are now established. 
The chief criticism of the examination system has always been that 
it was conducted by men who were out of touch with the schools, and 
that the examinations tended to be the goal of school work instead 
of a test of its results. To obviate these defects the board proposed 
that examining bodies should keep more closely in touch with the 
teachers, either by appointing representatives of the latter on their 
boards, or permitting them to submit their own syllabuses, or taking 
into consideration the teachers’ estimates of the merits of candidates.

It was further recommended that an authority be appointed to co- 
ordinate the standards of the examination, and it was proposed that 
this function be exercised by the Board of Education, assisted by an 
advisory committee representing universities, examining bodies, teach- 
ers, education authorities, and professional and commercial bodies. 
In December, 1915, the board indicated in Circular 933 that their 
proposals had met with considerable approval, except that it was 
generally urged that the additional expenditure that would result 
from the scheme should be borne by the State. It was also insisted 
that provision should be made for the inclusion of such subjects as 
manual instruction, housecraft, music, and drawing in the proposed 
examinations. Owing to the war it was felt to be impossible for 
financial reasons to proceed with the plan, but the following educa- 
tional points as a basis for future action met with general agreement: 
(a) Limitation of external examination to two examinations at the age of 
about 16 and 18, respectively. 
(b) Recognition of the principle that the group rather than the individual 
subject should be the unit on which success or failure is determined 
in the first examination. 
(c) Concentration in the second examination on a special group of studies 
with one or more by-subjects. 
(d) Inclusion of subjects such as drawing, music, manual instruction, house- 
craft, or some of them, in the scheme of examination; and 
(e) Provisions for securing the cooperation of the teachers with the exam- 
ining body. 
A return was made to the proposals in Circular 996, which was 
issued on May 25, 1917, announcing that the board intended to put 
the system into operation on August 1, 1917, and would serve as the 
coordinating authority. A secondary school examinations council was 
established to act as an advisory council, consisting originally of 
18 and later 21 members, and including representatives of exam- 
ination boards of universities (9), of the teachers’ registration council 
(5), of the county council association (2), of the municipal corpora- 
tions council (2), of a newly created standing committee of profes- 
sional bodies (1), of the association of education committees (1), 
and of a secondary school headmaster as supernumerary. Officials 
of the board may attend meetings of the council, but have no vote. 
The functions of the council are to deal with the following matters: 
(a) The recommendation of examining bodies for approval by the coordinat- 
ing authority. 
(b) The maintenance by each approved examining body of an adequate 
standard both for a pass in the examinations and for a pass with 
eredit. 
(c) Investigation of complaints made by school authorities with regard to 
examinations. 
(d) Promotion of conferences with examining bodies and others as occasion 
arises,
-P-A-G-E-36
36 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
(e) The form and contents of the certificates granted on the result of the 
examinations and the arrangements for their issue. 
(f) Negotiations with universities and professional bodies for the acceptance 
of the examination certificates as exempting the holders from certain 
other examinations. 
The council will act in an advisory capacity and make suggestions 
for reform to the board as the coordinating authority, but “the coun- 
cil will consult the board before committing themselves on questions 
of principle or policy which are controversial or specially important.” 
No examination scheme will be approved unless it provides for 
bringing teachers into touch with the examining board, for exam- 
ining a school on its own syllabus, if it so chooses, and the syllabus 
is, in the opinion of the examining body, adequate in scope or char- 
acter and the estimates of candidates as reported by their principals 
are taken into account. The board have undertaken to pay $10 for 
each pupil in a State-aided school who takes an examination as a 
member of his class. 
The new scheme should have an important influence in reducing 
the existing situation to some sort of uniformity. English education 
has been too much subject to a system that disturbed the develop- 
ment of secondary education in this country in the latter part of the 
last century. Not only will it reduce the numerous examining bodies 
to a reasonable size, but the requirement that closer contact be main- 
tained with schools will have a salutary effect in removing from the 
school the necessity of sacrificing the real ends of education to the 
examination goal. <A similar attitude is developing in the matter 
of the award of scholarships. More and more, narrow specialization 
for ends that are not inherent in sound education is being eliminated, 
and examinations will but serve as tests to be taken in the ordinary 
course of developments. The problem that still remains to be solved 
relates to the nature of the examinations. Something has been done 
to discount cramming in the present regulations and to take into 
consideration a student’s record as reported by the teachers. The 
next step will undoubtedly be a consideration of the reform of the 
character of the examinations themselves. The probability is that 
more attention will be given in the future to oral tests and that in the 
written examinations mere repetition of information will be dis- 
couraged.+

cation, combined with the recognition of the inadequate attention 
given in schools and universities to applied science, led in 1916 to the 
appointment by the Prime Minister of a committee— 
to inquire into the position of natural science in the educational system of 
Great Britain, especially in secondary schools and universities, and to advise 
what measures are needed to promote its study, regard being had to the require- 
ments of a liberal education, to the advancement of pure science, and to the 
interests of the trades, industries, and professions which particularly depend 
upon applied science. 
The committee, consisting of 17 members, was under the chair- 
manship of Sir J. J. Thomson and issued its report in 1918. Evi- 
dence was collected from schools and universities, representative 
men of science in the fields of agriculture, chemistry, geology, engi- 
neering, and metallurgy, and a number of leading firms engaged in 
engineering and the chemical industry. 
After a brief reference to the history of science teaching and the 
prejudice against its introduction both in schools and universites, 
the report emphasizes the need of a wider extension of the subject: 
Now it is the war and its needs that have made us once again conscious of 
the nation’s weakness in science. But it is for the sake of the long years of 
peace, quite as much as for the days of war, that some improvement in the 
scientific education of the country is required. 
With regard to the controversy between the classicists and scien- 
tists, it is pointed out that the humanizing influence of science has 
too often been obscured. In urging the recognition of the educa- 
tional value of science, its place in education is thus summarized: 
It can arouse and satisfy the element of wonder in our nature. As an intel- 
lectual exercise it disciplines our powers of mind. Its utility and applica- 
bility are obvious. It quickens and cultivates directly the faculty of observa- 
tion. It teaches the learner to reason from facts which come under his own 
notice. By it the power of rapid and accurate generalization is strengthened. 
Without it, there is a real danger of the mental habit of method and arrange- 
ment never being acquired. Those who have had much to do with the teaching 
of the young know that their worst foe is indolence, often not willful, but due 
to the fact that curiosity has never been stimulated and the thinking powers 
never awakened. Memory has generally been cultivated, sometimes imagina- 
tion, but those whose faculties can best be reached through external and sensi- 
ble objects have been left dull or made dull by being expected to remember and 
appreciate without being allowed to see and criticize. In the science lesson, 
the eye and the judgment are always being called upon for an effort, and 
because the result is within the vision and appreciation of the learner, he is 
encouraged as he seldom can be when he is dealing with literature. It has 
often been noticed that boys when they begin to learn science receive an intel- 
lectual refreshment which makes a difference even to their literary work. 
This quotation has been made at length, in spite of wheat will be 
regarded by many as faulty psychology, because it furnishes the key- 
note of the report and in one form or another recurs many times,
-P-A-G-E-38
  38 _BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
and because it is representative of the type of thought on education 
that is frequently found in England. The report nowhere enters into 
a detailed discussion of the humanizing influence of science, but here 
and there deprecates the fact that many of the ablest boys and girls 
leave the secondary schools “ with little or no idea of its importance 
as a factor in the progress of civilization or of its influence on human 
thought.” 
Science teaching in secondary schools for boys— 
is in general confined to the elements of physics and chemistry; botany and 
zoology are, as a rule, taught only to those boys who intend to enter the 
medical profession, while geology, so far as it is taught at all, is taken in con- 
nection with geography, or informally as part of the activities of the school 
scientific society. 
Under the regulations of the Board of Education for grant-earning 
schools, science must be included in the curriculum, unless exceptions 
are permitted in special cases. But although science thus occupies 
a position in no way inferior to that of any other subject, the com- 
mittee found a number of conditions that militate against successful 
work in science. Among these are: (1) Late entrance into secondary 
school, the assumption being that 12 should be the normal age for 
entry. (2) Early leaving, after less than three years in school, due 
to “(a) the parents’ inability or reluctance to forego the wages 
which boys of 14 can earn; (0) the want of appreciation of the value 
of secondary education, even from the point of view of success in 
after life; (c) the tradition of beginning work at as early an age as 
possible; (d) the desire of the boys themselves to escape from the 
restraints of school life.” (3) Lack of advanced work for those 
remaining at school to 18. (4) Inadequate staffing, equipment, and 
time. (5) Restricted scope, with the result that “in some cases 
physics up to the age of 16 means little more than practical measure- 
ments and heat, while in chemistry the theoretical foundations of the 
subject are often neglected.” (6) Inadequate provision of university 
entrance scholarships for boys who have specialized in science. The 
situation is still less satisfactory in the public schools, many of which 
are not inspected by the Board of Education and in which the liter- 
ary and classical traditions are more influential. It frequently hap- 
pens that little or no science is offered in these schools to boys who 
specialize in classics, even though adequate provision is made for 
the subject on the modern sides. The public schools in turn exert 
an adverse influence on the preparatory schools because science car- 
ries hardly any weight either in the entrance or scholarship ex- 
aminations. 
In the secondary schools for girls the conditions are less favor- 
able and there is even less definiteness than in the boys’ schools as 
to the nature of education to be provided and the relative importance 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 39 
of subjects. The Board of Education, in its regulations for grant- 
earning secondary schools for girls, permits the substitution of a 
course in domestic subjects for science and mathematics after 15, and 
in the period preceding this age the time assigned to science is quite 
inadequate. In a large number of private schools the subject is 
omitted entirely. 
With reference to secondary education in general the committee 
is in agreement with the present trend of thought in England that: 
The best preparation for any occupation or profession is a general education 
reached by the average boy at the age of 16, followed, where possible, by a more 
specialized course on a limited range of subjects. This general education should pro- 
vide normally for the study of English, including history and geography, languages 
other than English, mathematics, and science; each of these subjects should be 
regarded as an integral part of the education of both boys and girls, and a fair balance 
should be maintained between the time allotted to them. 
In a four-year course from 12 to'16 not less than four periods a 
week in the first year nor on the average less than six periods a week 
in the following three years should be given to science. Efficient 
teaching of the subject should be promoted by a system of State 
inspection and by its inclusion in the first school examination,’ 
which should come at the completion of the general course at about 
the age of 16. : 
The further recognition of science in a secondary education must 
in the opinion of the committee be accompanied by a revision of the 
curriculum, which has tended to become too narrow and to be out 
of touch with many of its applications. “The course should be self- 
contained, and designed so as to give special attention to those 
natural phenomena which are matters of everyday experience; in 
fine, the science taught should be kept as closely connected with 
human interests as possible.” The committee finds general agree- 
ment that the best preparation for the study of science in secondary 
schools is a course of nature study up to the age of 12, and suggests 
that the work of the first year might include physiography, practical 
work involving measurements of simple physical quantities, and 
serving as an introduction to some important physical branches in 
connection with the making of such things as electric bells, small 
induction coils, telescopes, pumps, and so on; where laboratory facili- 
ties are available the committee favors, in addition to physiography, 
“a course of elementary general science, including work of an intro- 
ductory kind on hydrostatics, heat, and the properties, both physical 
and chemical, of air and water.” 
The systematic study of science, beginning at about the age of 
13, should include physics, chemistry, and biology, not with a view   
1See on the question of secondary school examinations, pp. 32ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  40 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
to training specialists, but rather to give as good a mental discipline 
as possible and an acquaintance with the principles involved in the 
phenomena of daily experience in each of these branches. The report 
emphasizes the responsibility of the science teacher for the English 
in which the work of his class is written, and the excellent oppor- 
tunities for teaching clear writing in ccnnection with everyday 
laboratory work and for instilling the habit of reading books in 
science. Some modifications would be essential in the case of girls. 
Hygiene, for example, should be well taught in girls’ schools, but 
preferably at the 16 to 18 stage: 
Where this is impossible definite teaching on the laws of health and on 
personal hygiene may well form part of the work of the lower forms, but it 
can not be properly considered as a part of the science course. Similarly, 
lessons on the everyday affairs of the household are obviously of practical im- 
portance, and they form a part of scientific education if they are given by a 
teacher who has a real background of scientific knowledge. But much of the 
domestic science taught in schools has no claim to the name of science at all; 
it would be less pretentious and more accurate to cull it housecraft and find 
a place for it outside the hours allotted to science. 
At the age of 16 students may begin a more intensive study, usu- 
ally for two years, or some special subject, but without neglecting 
other branches of the general course, especially English and mathe- 
matics, and frequently enough French and German to be used as 
tools. The specialists in science will carry forward to a higher 
stage the work in two or more of the sciences—physics, chemistry, or 
biology—the choice depending somewhat upon the future career of 
the students. The fact may here be mentioned that under the new 
regulations for advanced courses in scondary schools the Board of 
Education in 1917 recognized 63 courses in science and mathematics 
out of a total of 95 approved, the remainder being distributed be- 
tween classics (13) and modern languages (19). At the same time it 
is recommended that a course or courses be offered suitable for stu- 
dents specializing in other subjects than science. Tie following 
courses are suggested tentatively: 
A. (1) A course on the outlines of cosmical physics ard astronomical prin- 
ciples of general interest, such as the measurement of time, the calendar, the 
size and mass of the earth and sun; the applications of spectroscopy to eluci- 
date the composition of the stars, nebule, etc.; (2) a course on the general 
principles of geology, without too much technical detail, illustrated by local 
examples and the use of geological maps; (3) a course on physiology and 
hygiene, which would include a discussion of the part played by bacteria and 
other lower organisms in fermentation and in the spread of disease; (4) a 
course on physical meteorology ; the:composition and general circulation of the 
atmosphere, relation of wind to pressure, storm, clouds, rain, snow, thunderstorm, 
the aurora, weather-mapping. ° 
B. Courses on the history of science, e. g., (1) the history of astronomy from 
the Greeks to Newton, including some account of the geocentric and heliocentrie 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 41 
systems; (2) the history of mechanics on the lines of the earlier portions of 
Mach’s Principles of Mechanics. 
©. Courses on the development of scientific ideas, e. g., the constitution of 
matter; the conservation of energy; the doctrine of evolution; heredity; immu- 
nity. 
D. The lives and work of scientific men, e. g., Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo, 
Newton, Lavoisier, Cavendish, Faraday, Clark Maxwell, Kelvin, Pasteur, 
Darwin, and Helmholtz. 
E. The bearing of scientific inventions on industrial progress, e. g., in con- 
nection with the history of farming or other local industries; methods of trans- 
port by land, water, and air; means of communication, such as signaling, 
telegraphy, telephones ; methods of lighting. 
F. Courses of a more practical kind than those mentioned above on the par- 
ticular applications of science, e. g., on the internal-combustion engine or the 
dynamo; such courses would appeal to boys with a mechanical turn of mind. 
G. A course on the method and philosophy of science, historically treated 
with special reference to the work of Aristotle and his predecessors, Archimedes, 
Galileo, and Bacon, and the later experimental philosophers. 
The committee recommends that, if a second school examination 
is adopted in accordance with recent proposals of the Board of Edu- 
cation, candidates be examined in the group of subjects in which they 
have specialized, together with at least one other general subject. 
Thus a student who has taken an advanced course in science should be 
examined in that subject as well as in history or an ancient or modern 
language or English literature. . Candidates who pass the second 
school examination might properly be exempted from the inter- 
mediate examination which in some universities comes at the end of 
the first year. 
The committee recognizes that any progress in the teaching of 
science depends on the adequate supply of teachers well trained in 
academic and professional subjects, and that such a supply is depend- 
ent on the payment of considerably better salaries than at present and 
on improvement in conditions of service. It is suggested that, in 
addition to university. study of science, teachers be required to have 
one year of training, spent partly in actual teaching in a secondary 
school and partly in attendance at professional teachers’ courses at 
the universities. Such training should later be supplemented by 
further study and visits to other teachers and schools. Other essen- 
tials to successful advancement of the position of science are suitable 
laboratory accommodation, equipment, and libraries, with apparatus 
and books, periodically renewed and supplemented. . 
Turning to the universities, the committee recommends an increase 
in the number of scholarships, especially for students of science, but 
based on an examination that does not encourage overspecialization 
in the schools. Since the need of an increased number of trained 
scientific workers could not be met by an extension of scholarships, 
it is suggested that university fees be lowered. The normal age at
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
which boys should pass from the secondary schools, at least to the 
universities of Oxford and Cambridge, should be 18 rather than 19, 
the usual age before the war. More adequate opportunities should 
be offered for students who do not intend to work for an honors 
degree to take a continuous course in science for a pass degree corre- 
sponding more nearly to the B.S. in this country. But the committee 
is opposed to one-sided specialization, since— 
the increase of specialization in all branches of knowledge at the universities 
has brought it about that students of one branch of knowledge have little 
opportunity of hearing anything about other subjects. It is therefore very 
desirable that there should be given at the universities courses of lectures of a 
general character on philosophy, history, literature, science, and economics. 
On the completion of the undergraduate course the committee urges 
the introduction of a year’s research work, not so much for the sake 
of getting new results as for the training afforded in independence of 
thought, maturity of judgment, and self-reliance, and for the gain 
in critical powers and enthusiasm for service. The committee recom- 
mends a uniform and comprehensive system of research degrees in 
accordance with the resolutions passed at the Universities’ Confer- 
ence held on May 18,1917. Far larger provision should be made by 
means of scholarships for the encouragement of postgraduate re- 
search, since “no expenditure of public money on scholarships holds 
out more prospects of valuable returns.” For the promotion of 
original research by students and members of university faculties the 
committee recommends an increase of State grants to insure the effi- 
cient equipment of laboratories and a reduction in the amount of time 
required by routine duties. 
The report also considers the relation of science to medicine, engi- 
neering, agriculture, the Army, the civil service, and its importance 
in the preparation of students for these professions. With reference 
to technical education outside the universities the committee recom- 
mends an increase in “the provision of instruction in pure and 
applied science in technical schools and institutions of all grades,” 
including junior and senior technical schools and evening schools, all 
of which need to be adequately coordinated so that students can pass 
from one to the other. ‘“ Science, both in its general aspects and in its 
bearing on industry,” should find a place in the courses of the 
proposed continuation schools, and might properly be more exten- 
sively introduced in schemes and systems for adult education. The 
committee declares with reference to the latter that: 
We are by no means sure that popular interest in science fs 9s great to-dov 
as it was 30 years ago. Until this general interest in science is extended and 
increased and the deficiencies of adult education in this respect are made good, 
an important piece of work in national education remains to be done,
-P-A-G-E-43
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 43 
The report closes with a consideration of the supply of trained 
scientific workers for industrial and other purposes which the com- 
mittee regards as a matter of the utmost gravity and urgency, for— 
It is agreed on all sides that it is absolutely necessary for the prosperity and 
safety of the country after the war that the development of the resources of the 
Empire and the production of our industries must be on a scale greatly in excess 
of anything we have hitherto achieved. Schemes of reconstruction and develop- 
ment are being prepared and discussed; each one of them requires a supply of 
trained workers, and the proposals will be futile unless a large army of these is 
forthcoming. 
The work of the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, 
established in July, 1915, has already stimulated a new attitude 
among employers to the need of well-directed research, better train- 
ing, and the more skillful use of scientific methods. An extensive 
movement has been inaugurated toward the formation of research 
associations in the larger industries, some working independently, 
some in connection with universities. This movement will lead to a 
demand for more trained men and will offer better recognition and 
higher remuneration for their services than hitherto. To meet this 
demand the supply on the basis of prewar statistics was inadequate. 
After canvassing the possibilities the committee concludes that: 
It is of the utmost importance that ability should not be wasted, and if it 
is not to be wasted, measures must, as we have said, be taken to insure (1) that 
no pupil capable of profiting by a full secondary education should miss the 
opportunity of receiving it; and (2) that the leakage from the schools should 
be so far as possible stopped. 
For these the doors to the universities and technical colleges must 
be thrown open by means of. scholarships and maintenance grants, 
and the development of sufficient and attractive careers for trained 
skill and knowledge. No small factor in the movement is the dis- 
semination of a knowledge and appreciation of the need of reform. 
If science is to come by its own, the Nation as a whole must be brought to 
recognize the fundamental importance of the facts and principles of science to 
the right ordering of our national life. The more closely the work of our 
legislators touches the life of the people, the more intimately it is concerned 
with questions of food supply, housing, transport, the utilization of natural 
resources, and the conditions which make for bodily health, the more dependent 
it becomes on the skilled advice and assistance of those who can bring their 
knowledge of science to bear on social and economic problems. Certainly we 
must provide the requisite training and opportunities for those who are capable 
of advancing natural knowledge or acting as scientific experts. But it is no 
less important that we should secure for all who are of an age to receive it 
an education which will enable them to realize ine vital need of a knowledge 
of science both for the individual and national well-being.

POSITION OF MODERN LANGUAGES.' 
The committee to inquire into the position of modern languages in 
the educational system of Great Britain was appointed by the Prime 
Minister in 1916, under the chairmanship of Mr. Stanley Leathes, 
-and reported in 1918. Considerable unrest has existed for some. time 
on the neglect of modern languages and dissatisfaction has arisen 
with the assumption that English alone is an adequate medium for 
conducting the ever-increasing world intercourse of the country. As 
in the case of the neglect of science the uneasiness has been not a 
little stimulated by the greater attention devoted to such matters in 
Germany. The work of the present committee must, therefore, be 
considered in relation to the whole movement for reconstruction in 
English education that will have its effect not merely on the schools 
but on commerce and industry as well.. The province of the com- 
mittee was as follows: 
To inquire into the position occupied by the study of modern languages in 
the educational system of Great Britain, especially in secondary schools and 
universities, and to advise what measures are required to promote their study, 
regard being had to the requirements of a liberal education, including an ap- 
preciation of the history, literature, and civilization of other countries, and to 
the interests of commerce and publie service. 
The committee followed the same procedure as the committee on 
the position of natural science and heard witnesses representing in- 
dustry and commerce, educational institutions and associations, and 
the public services. Questions were also sent to similar representative 
organizations. 
An account of the history of modern languages in Great Britain 
indicates that the modern subjects have received adequate recogni- 
tion in the schools and universities only during the past 30 years, 
but that public interest has not been strong and the supply of 
teachers with appropriate qualifications has not kept up with the 
demand. Several reasons, obvious to the American educator, have 
militated against a better appreciation of modern subjects, ndt the 
least valid of these being the richness of English literature and the 
extensiveness of the repertory of knowledge in most fields, as well 
as the insular situation of the country. Foreigners, too, have taken 
the trouble to learn English, so that this language served as an 
adequate medium of intercourse the world over. “The need of 
modern language study was not clear and insistent before the war.” 
In the schools modern subjects have suffered, as most new subjects, 
in competition with those that have a traditional place and are en- 
couraged by the granting of scholarships and other incentives.

of modern languages in the educational system of Great Britain, Cd. 9036. (London, 
1918.)
-P-A-G-E-45
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 45 
In competition with the classics, modern language studies suffered from un- 
certainty of method and of aims, from lack of established traditions and stand- 
ards; teachers needed exceptional qualifications, involving unusual length of 
training and expense; many were accepted as instructors whose attainments 
were frankly insufficient. Those of the highest attainments and ideals were 
discouraged by indifference, sometimes by contempt and hostility. 
Much progress has been made in recent years; any further advance 
depends on the cultivation of sound public opinion. With this end 
in view the committee has defined the many-sided values of modern 
studies, that is, “all those studies (historical, economic, literary, 
critical, philological, and other) which are approached through 
modern foreign languages ”: 
Modern studies subserve the purposes of industry and commerce; they are 
needed for scientific instruction and information; by them alone can be 
gathered and disseminated that more intimate knowledge of foreign countries 
which is necessary for the wise conduct of its affairs by a democratic people; 
they are required for the public service of’ the country at home as well as 
abroad; through and by them our people can learn what is best and highest 
in other countries. Some of us may attach more importance to one, some to 
another of these elements, but all together must combine to supply such motives 
as can unite and mobilize a nation in the pursuit of worthy knowledge. 
The relation and place of modern studies for each of these ends 
and purposes are considered in some detail. But in addition to the 
practical values, modern studies it is claimed are an instrument of 
culture— 
and by culture we mean that training which tends to develop the higher facul- 
ties, the imagination, the sense of beauty, and the intellectual comprehension, 
Clearer vision, mental harmony, a just sense of proportion, higher illumination— 
these are the gifts that culture ought to bring. It can not bring them to all; 
in their fullness they can be possessed by few; but in some measure they may 
be shared by all who desire them. 
If modern studies are to meet with the same success that has at- 
tended the study of the classics— 
We need an ideal such as inspires the highest classical studies. The best work 
~will never be done with an eye to material profit. We must frame our ideal 
sso that it can be consistently pursued through the whole course of school and 
aniversity life and even beyond. The first object in schools must be to lay: the 
foundation of scholarship and skilled facility of expression and comprehension. 
‘The “ more or less,” the “ there or thereabouts,” is not good enough in language, 
or in any other instrument of culture or information; the standard of accuracy 
and of form can not be too high. Early we should also aspire to make some 
of the boys and girls understand that foreign languages are not learned as an 
end in themselves, but as a means-.to the comprehension of foreign peoples, 
whose history is full of fascinating adventure, who have said and felt and seen 
and made things worthy of our comprehension, who are now alive and engaged 
in like travail with ourselves, who see things differently from ourselves ani 
therefore can the better help us to understand what is the whole of truth, 
After discussing the general aims and purposes underlying the 
study of modern languages, the report takes up the question of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
relative importance of the several languages—Kuropean and non- 
European. French, from every point of view, is declared for English 
purposes to be the most important living tongue, the standard being 
as follows: 
The importance of any language may be judged by the significance of its 
people in the development of modern civilization, by the intrinsic value of its 
literature, by its contribution to the valid learning of our times, and by its 
practical use in commercial and other national intercourse. 
Germany, Italy, Spain, and Russia deserve a first-class place, after 
France, in the modern studies of the universities, and all but Russian, 
which is apparently not yet sufficiently organized or valuable for 
such purposes, should find a place in the schools. With reference to 
the vexed question of German, the report leaves no room for doubt 
as to its importance from the point of view of information in a large 
number of fields of human knowledge. But by the standard quoted 
above the report believes, that: 
The time is hardly propitious for their dispassionate consideration. No 
doubt, as a factor of the first importance in shaping the destiny of Europe dur- 
ing the last hundred years, Germany must retain a permanent and compelling 
interest to the historical student, though the estimate of the causes which have 
raised her to that position may undergo changes in the opinion of succeeding 
generations. And on this also there will be general agreement. After the war 
the importance of German must correspond with the importance of Germany, 
If Germany after the war is still enterprising, industrious, highly organized, 
formidable no less in trade than in arms, we can not afford to neglect her or 
ignore her for a moment; we can not leave any of her activities unstudied. 
The knowledge of Germany by specialists will not suffice; it must be widespread 
throughout the people. A democracy can not afford to be ignorant. We may 
indicate one point in particular, which is likely to be of importance at the end 
of the war. It will in any case be impossible to oust the use of German in 
commerce, even-for our own purposes at home, apart from any question of 
competition in neutral countries. The mere settlement of pre-war accounts with 
Germany will be a long and difficult matter. If we are not ourselves able to 
supply men who have sufficient knowledge of German to conduct the necessary 
correspondence, strong incentive will be offered to the old practice of employing 
qualified German clerks for the purpose. This is only one of many considera- 
tions which lead us to the conclusion that it is of essential importance to the 
Nation that the study of the German language should be not only maintained 
but extended. 
Besides these five languages for which adequate provision should 
be made in all universities, the study of other European languages and 
of non-European languages should be promoted in various centers, 
determined partly by commercial needs, partly by other interests. 
London it is recommended should become a center for an institution 
for the study of the minor European languages similar to the School 
of Oriental Studies. In general, however, “the prospects of modern 
studies depend on the esteem of the public.”
-P-A-G-E-47
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 47 
The nature of instruction in foreign languages must vary according 
to the needs, age, and training of the students. Home instruction by 
skilled governesses may lay a sound foundation for the future, and 
it is suggested that kindergartens conducted in a foreign language 
might serve the same purpose. Systematic study in school or uni- 
versity is essential and should be supplemented by residence abroad, 
especially by those who intend to teach. Facilities for foreign resi- 
dence and the exchange of teachers and pupils should be systemati- 
cally organized and encouraged. 
The systematic study of modern languages should be begun in the 
secondary schools; the committee does not consider it advisable to 
introduce them in elementary schools, although the phonetic study of 
English might well be begun there and serve as a starting point for 
foreign languages. The committee does not commit itself on the ques- 
tion of the right age for beginning foreign-language study, but pre- 
fers to define its position in general terms: 
The position of reformers is that it is neither expedient nor profitable to be- 
gin the systematic study of a foreign language in school until the child has 
reached a stage of intellectual development which admits of his having already 
received a sound training in the use of his mother tongue, as well as a reason- 
able discipline in the essentials of a wide general education. 
The scope of modern subjects will vary somewhat according to the 
type of secondary school attended, and the continuity of study. The 
chief aim should be to give a sound training in the principles of 
Janguage, and a firm basis on which a pupil can advance by private 
study. Intensive work on one language is much more to be com- 
mended than the sacrifice of thoroughness by the study of two or 
three at the same time—a practice not uncommon in England. This 
principle is warranted by the fact that success in one language is 
the best preparation, not only for its further study but for the study 
of a second or more languages. In a four-year course, that is, from 
11 or 12 to about 16, the energies of the pupils should not be dis- 
sipated. “It should be possible in a four-year course to bring one 
language to a useful point with the majority; only with the minority 
can a second language be begun with any advantage.” The eco- 
nomical minimum for the study of the first language is four hours 
a week, preferably for two years, when a second language may be 
taken up. Specialization in language studies should not begin until 
a student has passed his first school examination, at about the age 
of 16. The advanced courses, as defined by the Board of Education, 
should cover as wide a range as possible, and private study should 
be encouraged. 
The chief essential for the improvement of the status of modern 
studies is to secure well-qualified teachers, and this end can only be 
  
4 See pp. 29ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. ( 
achieved by improving the pay and prospects of those who must 
necessarily undertake, in the case of modern languages, an unusually 
long, laborious, and expensive training. “It is desirable that every 
teacher of modern languages in a secondary school should have a 
university degree, should have spent not less than a year abroad 
under suitable conditions, and should have undergone definite train- 
ing for his profession.” The committee recommends that profes- 
sional training should consist of a period gpent in a school recognized 
for the purpose, where a teacher— 
would at first employ his time in observing the methods of skilled teachers, 
and studying the scheme of work and the elements of his art, and would thus 
gradually come to understand the principles he was to follow and the difficulties 
he would have to meet. After a sufficient period of initiation he might begin 
to teach under supervision, receiving frequent advice and practical hints; and 
before his period of training was over, he might begin to run alone. 
The committee accepts the conclusions of the Modern Language 
Association that qualified British teachers are superior to foreign 
teachers, partly because the latter are found less effective for disci- 
pline and for the exercise of a salutary influence over the pupils, 
partly because the training of foreign students has tended to give 
them an “excessive philological and antiquarian bias,” and chiefly 
because “it is natural to suppose that the studies themselves will be 
more successfully presented to the classes by teachers who approach 
them from the British point of view.” Foreign exchange assistants, 
however, are a most valuable supplement. 
But “the universities are the keystone of the whole structure of 
higher education.” At present the arrangements as to staff, equip- 
ment, and expenditure for modern languages are defective in the 
British universities. The committee urges that action should be taken 
by Parliament to adopt a policy embodying— 
a scheme providing for the establishment, within 10 years from the conclusion 
of the war, in addition to all the posts that already exist and those that may 
be founded by private or local initiative, of, say, 55 first-class professorships— 
15 of French studies, and 10 each for the studies concerned with the four other 
principal countries of Europe—and double that number of lectureships. 
Such a scheme must be accompanied by a considerable increase in 
the number of scholarships for entrance to the universities and post- 
graduate studies. In 1911-12 only 8 out of 440 entrance scholar- 
ships at Oxford and Cambridge were awarded to modern languages. 
Assistance should also be afforded to students to spend some time 
abroad. ‘ 
In addition to organized study in secondary schools and universi- 
ties the report emphasizes the importance of providing facilities for 
the study of modern languages in later life, especially for those who 
discover the need of such knowledge for commerce or industry. The
-P-A-G-E-49
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 49 
local authorities are urged to extend the provisions already made in 
evening classes by the organization of cther part-time and even brief 
whole-time study. But the pursuit of such study can only be stimu- 
lated if adequate pay and prospects are held out: for specialization, a 
condition not prevailing at present. 
For the specialist in modern language teaching ‘the sections on 
method and examinations will prove of particular interest, especially 
the carefully elaborated consideration of the merits and limitations 
of the direct method, of the importance of oral tests, and of the place 
of translation from English into the foreign tongue. The report 
contains a summary of conclusions and recommendations, an appen- 
dix on the hours of work, salaries, and pensions in a number of foreign 
countries, and a letter from 31 ‘professors and readers of modern 
languages in British universities representing their views on the sub- 
ject of the committee’s reference. The report represents the substan- 
tial consensus of the whole committee; the exceptions are certain 
reservations on the questions of the educational value of French and 
Latin, compulsory Latin at the university, languages in the first 
school examination, modern sides, the age at which foreign languages 
should be begun, preparatory schools, and the classification of schools. 
The report will, like the corresponding report on the position of 
natural science, exercise an important influence on the development 
of higher education in Great Britain. The general position of the 
committee may well be summarized in its own words: 
The due advance of modern studies appears to us to require in the first 
place a change of spirit. We do not underrate, we may even be held by some 
to have unduly emphasized, the practical value of modern studies as affecting 
the material fortunes of the Nation, its classes, and its individual citizens. But 
no department of knowledge can obtain its highest development unless it be 
inspired by an ideal. That ideal of humane learning concerned with the 
thought, the life, the achievements, the psychology, in fact, the entire history of 
modern nations, we have endeavored to indicate and define; and we hnve found 
an encouraging example in the highest results attained during many centuries 
by the culture based on the records of ancient civilization. What has been 
done through the study of the dead people of Greece and Rome, can be Gone, 
we conceive, through the study of the living peoples of the habitable globe in 
proportion to their several contributions to the art of living. Modern studies 
must for such purposes be pursued with like intensity of purpose, with like 
feith and sympathy, with like seriousness and atcuracy, and a like idea: of 
scholarship. i 
TENDENCIES IN SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. 
The education act gives no special treatment or attention to sec- 
ondary education. Local authorities are encouraged to devote more 
money to higher education by the removal of the existing restriction 
on the amount that can be levied from the local rates, and the law 
171030°—21—Bull. 89-4
-P-A-G-E-50
  50 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  specifically requires that “adequate provision shall be made in order 
to secure that children and young persons shall not be debarred from 
receiving the benefits of any form of education by which they are 
capable of profiting, through inability to pay fees.” Although the 
law does not require the establishment of secondary schools, the Board 
of Education is empowered to withhold its refusal of schemes sub- 
mitted by local education authorities unless they make adequate pro- 
visions for education in the area as a whole. Indirectly, therefore, 
considerable pressure will be brought to bear to increase the oppor- 
tunities for higher education that are at present limited. The ques- 
tion of free secondary education was not entirely lost sight of, and 
it was proposed, during the course of the debate on the Fisher bill, 
that fees be abolished in State-aided secondary schools. The proposal 
did not meet with much response. Mr. Fisher pointed out that 67 
per cent of the pupils in the State-aided schools had come from the 
public elementary schools; instead of abolishing fees and losing 
$5,000,000 of revenue, it was wiser to encourage local education au- 
thorities to provide more secondary schools, to apply for more State 
grants, and as a natural consequence to provide more free places in 
such schools. The legal requirement quoted above would insure that 
no pupil of ability would be deprived of his opportunity of securing 
a higher education. 
No action has accordingly been taken by the State to secure the 
establishment of free secondary education as a part of the national 
system. There is, however, a pronounced body of opinion through- 
out the country in favor of free higher education for those who have 
the ability to profit by it. The British Labor Party had something 
of this kind in mind when they demanded in their program public 
provision “ for the education alike of children, of adolescents, and of 
adults, in which the Labor Party demands a genuine equality of 
opportunity, overcoming all differences of material circumstances.” 
The Workers’ Educational Association adopted the following resolu- 
tions on full-time secondary education as part of their program for 
educational reconstruction: f 
That all children admitted to a secondary school should have reached an 
approved standard of education, the ground of transfer being the fitness of the 
scholar for the broader curriculum, 
That free provision should be made for all who are eligible and desirous to 
enter such schools, puch provisions to include a satisfactory maintenance 
allowance where necessary. 
That the number of secondary schools of varying types should be largely 
increased, and that the curriculum be made more variable to meet the interests 
of individual scholars. 
The sense of the Education Reform Council, a large and representa- 
tive body appointed at the instance of the Teachers’ Guild, was that
-P-A-G-E-51
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. , 61 
scholarships and free places “should be provided in such numbers as 
will admit to secondary schools those pupils from elementary or pre- 
paratory schools who can profitably undertake a full secondary 
course.” It also urged that “the number of efficient secondary 
schools of varying types should be increased,” a view shared by the 
Incorporated Association of Headmasters, which declared in its edu- 
cational policy that “there should be a considerable increase in the 
number of secondary schools, i. e., schools which provide some form 
of whole-time general education as distinct from technical training 
up to the age of 18.” The Incorporated Association of Assistant Mas- 
ters in Secondary Schools also declared it to be part of its educational 
policy that “no child who has shown capacity to profit by a course of 
secondary education should be refused admission to the schools, even 
if the child has to be fed and clothed at the public expense to enable 
him to attend.” This view was slightly expanded in the educational 
policy of the National Association of Education Officers, who declared 
“that no child who is qualified to receive secondary, technical, or uni- 
versity education should be debarred therefrom for financial reasons.” 
Finally, the Teachers’ Registration Council supported “the principle 
of abolishing fees in secondary schools for the maintenance of which a 
local education authority is responsible, and also the principle of a 
due number of free places in secondary schools which are partly 
maintained by State grants.” 
The Athenaeum and the Times Educational Supplement went 
beyond this program and urged the establishment of a system of 
universal free secondary education based on a common elementary 
education. The common basis would continue up to the age of 11 or 12 
and would be followed by a general secondary education adapted to 
individual ability and interests up to 15 and 16. It ishardly probable — 
that these proposals will take concrete shape for some time. The 
principle that differentiation should take place at the age of 11 or 12 
is very generally accepted and is undoubtedly the age that will be 
universally adopted. The accomplishments of an elementary school 
or its equivalent up to that age will become the basis upon which will 
be developed the advanced work in the upper grades and the central 
schools required by the act and the lower secondary school courses. 
It may be generally assumed that the opportunities that are de- 
manded will be extended and increased in public and other State- 
aided schools. In addition to these schools there has been a supply 
of private schools ranging all the way from the great public schools 
and other endowed schools to their private venture or proprietary 
school. At the present time neither the Board of Education nor 
any other authority knows the extent of this supply. Under the  
-P-A-G-E-52
BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
new act, however, the board is now empowered to secure a descrip- 
tion of all schools “in order that full information may be available 
as to the provision for education and the use made of such provision 
in England and Wales.” Together with local education authorities 
the board may inspect schools that desire to be recognized as efficient 
for certain purposes. The Teachers’ Registration Council will also 
affect the status of private schools indirectly in so far as a teacher’s 
eligibility to be registered will depend in part on the character of 
the schools in which he has served. Further, private schools will be 
subjected to severe competition for various reasons; the schools estab- 
lished by local education authorities will command more money 
from the State and their localities; such schools will offer higher 
salaries and pensions to teachers; the board will grant additional 
aid to the larger schools for advanced courses; and, finally, it is 
proposed that there shall be some differentiation between public and 
private schools in the certificates awarded as a result of the secondary 
schools examinations. On the other hand, the influence of compe- 
tition, inspection, and some public supervision may well stimulate 
the private schools to take a very real place in the national system. 
The private schools have always played an important part in English 
education, and, if they have not fully measured up to the claims of 
those who have favored their existence on the ground that they serve 
as experimental stations, they have furnished opportunities for sec- 
ondary education that would otherwise not have been available. 
Many will disappear under the full light of publicity, but many 
others may win a new place for themselves as the result of the 
revived interest in education. 
  THE MEANING OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION. 
Complete unanimity prevails on the broad question of the func- 
tion of secondary education. The opportunities will undoubtedly be 
demoeratized, and access to the secondary school will become more 
ready. There is no intention, however, to confuse the functions of 
secondary education by introducing into it elements of technical and 
vocational training. Those who charge the European secondary 
school with being the haven of aristocracy would be somewhat aston- 
ished to find liberal and conservative, democrat and aristocrat, em- 
ployee and employer united in complete agreement on the principle 
that “a secondary school exists to provide a liberal training, and 
it is no part of its task to furnish specific or technical instruction in 
the rudiments of professional studies or commercial routine.” 
(Schoolmasters’ Yearbook, 1918.) The Workers’ Educational Asso- 
ciation expresses the same view in its resolutions: 
That the requirements of a liberal education should be regarded as para- 
mount in the organization of every type of secondary school,
-P-A-G-E-53
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND. IRELAND. 53 
That in the interests alike of education and of economic efficiency a sound 
general education in childhood and adolescence is the necessary foundation 
for any specialized course of technical or professional training, both in town 
and country, and that therefore a technical education should be regarded as 
supplementary to secondary education. 
The Incorporated Association of Headmasters urges that: 
The essential characteristic of post-elementary education should be the 
development of various types of schools so as to give the best possible chance 
to the most varied kinds of ability. The one common feature must be that the 
aim is primarily educational—the harmonious development of the mental, 
moral, and physical powers. The imparting of the technical elements of a 
trade is not in itself an education, but to say this is not to deny that a great 
deal of the knowledge that lies at the foundation of every sort of trade and prac- 
tical pursuit can be and ought to be laid under contribution for the building up 
of various sorts of educational courses. 
The functions of liberal and technical education are thus clearly 
separated. Before entering upon a discussion of the meaning and 
content of a liberal education, the general aim of secondary educa- 
tion that a liberal education is to promote may be considered. Again 
it is illuminating to quote current English thought. The School- 
masters’ Yearbook, 1918, thus describes the purposes of secondary 
schools: 
They have to foster learning as a necessary element in life, and this they do 
by giving instruction which aids the pupil in his efforts to understand the 
things about him. To realize this purpose the schools need a wide curriculum, 
Literature, science, mathematics, art, and practical work all have their place, 
since each in its own sphere helps to cultivate that power of interpreting life 
which is the result of sound education. 
Similarly the Atheneum in endeavoring to combat what appeared 
to it and many others efforts on the part of employers united into a 
Federation of British Industries to direct education into vocational 
channels, sums up the needs of the day as follows (Mar., 1918) : 
But man can not live by bread alone. He is a member of a family, a trade- 
union, a club, a city, a nation, a church. He is a human personality, with 
something more than a pair of hands condemned to toil at the will of another. 
He has intellectual and esthetic taste (only too often cramped and unde- 
veloped) and moral principles. He believes in liberty, justice, and public right, 
and goes to give his life for these things. The worker is much more than a 
worker; he is a citizen. And every citizen, regardless of his social position or 
wealth, has claims which are prior even to the claims of industry itself— 
claims of opportunities to enable him to fulfill his manifold responsibilities as 
a producer, as a member of various social groups from the family to the State. 
His responsibilities are no less if he be a ship’s riveter than if he were a ship- 
builder. The engine fireman is no less a citizen than the railway director or 
the railway shareholder. 
The detailed definition of the content that should make up.a liberal 
education depends on these points of view. Democracy will make 
more and more demands on the intelligence of its citizens, both as  
-P-A-G-E-54
54 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-ly8, 
    : individuals and as members of society. The school should prolong 
rather than restrict the opportunities for that general education that 
is the foundation of the well-being of man as an individual and as a 
citizen. Those who look into the future see that for the working 
classes a new era is opening up in which more leisure will be pro- 
vided ; it should be one of the functions of education to train for the 
enjoyment of that leisure. Further, the extension of the franchise 
will require a more general dissemination of education than hitherto. 
There is also a genuine and sincere belief that technical and voca- 
tional training will be improved if based on a broad general educa- 
tion, a belief that is shared both by teachers and specialists alike. 
Industrial and commercial success and progress, it is felt, will depend 
on well-trained and well-educated leaders rather than on the early 
specialization of boys and girls. Finally, it is not improbable that 
the importance of vocational training for the masses of industrial 
workers may be proved by the experience with such training during 
the war to have been exaggerated. 
The question of educational values was raised soon after the out- 
break of the war and discussion was bandied to and fro on the 
merits of this subject or that, now classics, now the sciences, and 
from time to time modern languages. For a time it seemed that no 
advantages could be claimed for one subject without disparaging 
another. It was many months before it was recognized that the 
problem involved was much broader than that of the value of this 
subject or that, and that no settlement could be obtained unless the 
larger view were taken and the question approached from the stand- 
point of the needs of the boy or girl to be educated. If any progress 
was to be made, the curriculum as a whole must be subjected to 
critical evaluation. This stage was not reached until the middle 
of 1916. 
On February 2, 1916, a letter on the neglect of science, signed by a 
large number of eminent scientists, appeared in the Times. It was 
pointed out that the country had suffered checks during the war 
through lack of scientific knowledge among administrative officials, 
statesmen, and civil servants, and leaders in public and industrial 
life. In the history of the British Government Lord Playfair was the 
only scientist to become a cabinet minister. In general there was not 
enough knowledge of science to give an intelligent respect for it. 
Scientific method and scientific habit of mind would be essential to 
success in the period of reconstruction. At present science “ does not 
pay ” in most examinations, and few leaders in education are scien- 
tists. If science were assigned a greater value in the civil-service 
examinations, the subject would rise into its proper position and gain 
the respect necessary for national welfare. “ Our desire is to draw 
attention to this matter, not in the interests of existing professional
-P-A-G-E-55
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 55 
men of science, but as a reform which is vital to the continued 
existence of this country as a great power.” A meeting was held in 
London on May 3, 1916, at which resolutions were passed urging 
increased attention to science in educational institutions. 
On the day following this meeting, May 4, 1916, a number of 
eminent men of letters and scientists issued a letter on “ Educational 
Aims and Methods,” urging the claims of humanities. They pointed 
out the danger that results of a war in which material means and 
technical skill are essential might be misleading. 
If in our reforms we fix our eyes only on material ends, we may foster 
among ourselves that very spirit against which we are fighting to-day * * *. 
‘Technical knowledge is essential to our industrial prosperity and national 
safety ; but education should be nothing less than a preparation for the whole 
of life. 
It is essential, therefore, to consider carefully the effect of sweeping 
changes proposed at a time of great stress. The purpose of education 
is broader than preparation for a vocation. 
It should introduce the future citizens of the community, not merely to 
the physical structure of the world in which they live, but also to the deeper 
interests and problems of politics, thought, and human life. It should acquaint 
them, so far as may be, with the capacities and ideals of mankind, as ex- 
pressed in literature and art, with its ambitions and achievements as recorded 
in history, and with the nature and laws of the world as interpreted by 
science, philosophy, and religion. If we neglect physical science, we shall have 
a very imperfect knowledge of the world around us; but if we ignore or sub- 
ordinate the other elements of knowledge, we shall cut ourselves off from 
aspects of life of even greater importance. Even physical science will suffer. 
Some of its most distinguished representatives have strongly insisted that early 
specialization is injurious to the interests they have at heart, and that the best 
preparation for scientific pursuits is a general training which includes some 
study of language, literature, and history. Such a training gives width of 
view and flexibility of intellect. Industry and commerce will be most success- 
fully. pursued by men whose education has stimulated their imagination and 
widened their sympathies. 
A belief in intellectual training is more important than physical 
science, while scientific method is necessary not only in science proper 
but in all branches of education. The whole of civilization is rooted 
in the classics and can not be neglected by those who are interested in 
literature or government. “Greece and Rome afford us unique in- 
stances, the one of creative and critical intelligence, the other of 
constructive statesmanship.” In the closing paragraph of the letter 
a way was opened for securing cooperation and harmony on the larger 
question of the meaning of a liberal education: 
In urging this we do not commit ourselves to defending the present system 
of classical education in all its details. Still less do we claim for it any artificial 
privilege. We cordially sympathize with the desire to strengthen the teaching 
of modern history, of modern languages, and of the literature of our own 
country. Further, we fully accept the importance of promoting scientific re-
-P-A-G-E-56
  56 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
search, or extending scientific instruction in schools where it is still inadequately 
provided, and of improving the quality of science teaching; and we desire to 
cooperate with the representatives of these studies in insuring them a due 
place in our national education. At the same time we would point out that 
much criticism of our schools seems directed against a past state of things and 
ignores reforms which have been already effected. It is sometimes forgotten 
that the teaching of physical science is compulsory in all State-aided secondary 
schools, that of Latin, and of course of Greek, in none. 
In the following month, at the suggestion of the Historical Associa- 
tion, the principal organizations representing humanistic studies— 
the Classical, English, Geographical, Historical, and Modern Lan- 
guage Asociations—held a conference in Manchester, at which the 
following resolutions were passed: 
(i) It is essential that any reorganization of our educational system should 
make adequate provision for both humanistic and scientific studies. 
(ii) Premature specialization on any one particular group of studies, whether 
humanistic or scientific, to the exclusion of all others, is a serious danger, not 
only to education generally but to the studies concerned. 
(iii) Humanistic education implies the adequate study of language and litera- 
ture, geography, and history, which in each case should, at the appropriate stage 
of education, go beyond the pupils’ own language and country. 
(iv) The representatives of humanistic studies would welcome from the 
representatives of the mathematical and natural sciences a statement with 
regard to those studies similar to that contained in (iii). 
(v) In all reform of education it must never be forgotten that the first object 
is the training of human beings in mind and character, as citizens of a free 
country, and that any technical preparation of boys and girls for a particular 
profession, occupation, or work must be consistent with this principle. 
(vi) Subject to the above principles the associations concerned would wel- 
come a comprehensive revision of national education from the point of view 
of present needs. 
In response to this resolution the committce of the Association of 
Public School Science Masters, in October, expressed their agreement 
with the principles stated at the conference and sent the accompany- 
ing statement: 
“Natural science in education should not displace the “ humanistic” studies, 
but should be complementary to them. In this capacity natural science meets 
two needs in particular: 
1. Search for truth—tImaginative power indicates new fields in which further 
knowledge of truth may be revealed; its subsequent establishment depends on 
accurate observation, with constant recourse to nature for confirmation. The 
one aim of natural science is, in fact, the search for truth based on evidence 
rather than on authority. Hence the study of the subject implies accurate 
observation and description and fosters a love of truth. The special value of 
natural science in the training of mind and character lies in the fact that the 
history of the subject is a plain record of the search for truth for its own sake. 
2. Utility—There are certain facts and ideas in the world of natural science 
with which it is essential that every educated man should be familiar. A 
knowledge of these facts assists men (a) to understand how the forces of nature 
may be employed for the benefit of mankind, (b) to appreciate the sequence of

eause and effect in governing their own lives, and (c) to see things as they 
really are, and not to distort them into what they may wish them to be. It is 
the business of natural science in education to bring this knowledge within the 
range of all. 
This was followed by a letter in November from the Mathematical 
Association to the effect that: 
The teaching committee of the Mathematical Association concurs with the 
Councils of the Classical, English, Geographical, Historical, and Modern Lan- 
guage Associations in the view that any reorganization of our educational 
system should make adequate provision for both humanistic and _ scientific 
studies; that premature specialization should be avoided; and that technical 
preparation for a particular profession should be conceived in such a spirit 
that it misses none of the essentials of a liberal education. 
In reply to the invitation of the representative conference to make a state- 
ment as to the position of mathematical studies in schools, the Mathematical 
Association committee would submit that from a school course of mathematics 
the pupil should acquire—(1) an elementary knowledge of the properties of 
number and space; (2) a certain command of the methods by which such 
knowledge is reached and established, together with facility in applying 
mathematical knowledge to the problems of the laboratory and the workshop; 
(3) valuable habits of precise thought and expression; (4) some understanding 
of the part played by mathematics in industry and the practical arts, as an 
instrument of discovery in the sciences, and as a means of social organization 
and progress; (5) some appreciation of organized abstract thought as one of the 
highest and most fruitful forms of intellectual activity. 
In the course of the autumn of 1916 a Council for Humanistic 
Studies was formed representing the British Academy and the five 
associations mentioned above. The council entered into communi- 
cations with organizations representing natural science—the joint 
board of scientific studies of the Royal Society and a committee on 
the neglect of science for the purpose of arriving at a common basis 
for future action. As the result of a conference between the council 
and the joint board, the following resolutions were passed in Janu- 
ary, 1917: 
1. The first object in education is the training of human beings in mind and 
character, as citizens of a free country, and any technical preparation of boys 
and girls for a particular profession, occupation, or work must be consistent 
with this principle. 
2. In all schools in which education is normally continued up to or beyond 
the age of 16, and in other schools so far as circumstances permit, the curricu- 
lum up to about the age of 16 should be general and not specialized; and in this 
curriculum there should be integrally represented English (language and lit- 
erature), languages and literatures other than English, history, geography, 
mathematics, natural sciences, art, and manual training. 
8. In the opinion of this conference, both natural science and literary subjects 
should be taught to all pupils below the age of 16. 
4. In the case of students who stay at school beyond the age of 16, specializa- 
tion should be gradual and not complete. 
5. In many schools of the older type more time is needed for instruction in 
natural science; and this time can often be obtained by economy in the time 
allotted to classics, without detriment to the interests of classical education.
-P-A-G-E-58
  
58 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
6. In many other schools more time is needed for instruction in languages, 
history, and geography; and it is essential, in the interests of sound education, 
that this time be provided. 
7. While it is probably impossible to provide instruction in both Latin and 
Greek in all secondary schools, provision should be made in every area for 
teaching in these subjects, so that every boy and girl who is qualified to profit 
from them shall have the opportunity of receiving adequate instruction in 
them. 
Subject to a few verbal amendments proposed by the executive 
committee of the joint board, these resolutions represent the present 
settlement of the function of the secondary school. In the words of 
a report? issued by Sir Frederic G. Kenyon on behalf of the Council 
for Humanistic Studies: 
It is not a little that the organizations which represent all the principal sub- 
jects of education, whether scientific or humanistic, should agree in deprecating 
early specialization, and should recognize the importance of opening the doors 
of all subjects to all pupils, and of facilitating their entrance into the paths 
most suitable for them. * * * All alike deprecate the conduct of educa- 
tion in a commercial spirit, and declare their faith in a liberal education as 
the foundation for all activities of mind and spirit in a civilized country. 
A comparison of the above resolutions with the program laid 
down for secondary schools by the Board of Education (see p. 29) 
will indicate how closely these discussions represent the requirements 
of current practice. The effect of these discussions, together with the 
reports of the committees on the position of natural science and on 
the position of modern languages, will be to give greater reality to all 
the subjects in the schools and to build up a body of public opinion 
that will insist on their equal recognition. All the proposals for 
educational reconstruction that deal with secondary education concur 
with these resolutions which now represent the deliberate opinion of 
leaders in each of the subjects recommended, of statesmen, profes- 
sional men, and men of affairs. The great task still remains of se- 
curing the teachers educated and trained for the new duties laid upon 
the schools. The activities and progress of the Teachers’ Registra- 
tion Council and the Government inquiry into the whole queston of 
salaries are of great promise for the future status of the teachers. 
The future has still before it the consideration of the appropriate 
kind of training that must be devised. 
The aim of the secondary school is to impart a liberal education, 
the scope of which is now defined and permits such flexibility as is 
demanded by the needs and capacities of the individual. A general 
education will be provided for pupils between the ages of 12 and 16, 
and specialization will be based on this foundation, These will be 
incorporated in the university and other examinations, and the equal 
recognition of the subjects included in the resolutions will be pro-

moted in the reconstituted examinations for the higher branches of 
the Civil Service.1 There will be removed from the secondary schools 
that reproach to which the Education Reform Council drew attention 
in its report: 
At the same time they are convinced that in the general system of these 
schools the interests of the many have hitherto been-largely sacrificed to the 
special culture of the clever few, and that generally speaking the esthetic, 
observational, manual, and even literary elements of education have been 
starved to provide for an excessive and wasteful, because premature and inap- 
propriately methodized, attention to foreign languages, especially Latin. 
It is now clearly established and accepted after a struggle of 
nearly 300 years that classical monopoly is incompatible with the 
extension of educational opportunities. More secondary schools and 
easier access to them inevitably demand a broader definition of a 
liberal education than has hitherto prevailed, and such an education 
to be democratic must be subject to adaptation to the abilities and 
interests of the individuals who are to enjoy it. Referring to their 
regulations for secondary schools the Board of Education state that 
they— 
allow and encourage much elasticity in curricula, subject only to the funda- 
mental principle that the school course make effective provision for the develop- 
ment of bodily and mental faculties on broad and human lines in the pupils 
who will be the citizens of the future. . 
It remains for the future to prove whether England, in thus 
building her hopes on a broad, liberal education and on a curriculum 
humanized in all its branches and in defying the demands of her 
materialists who in the name of patriotism are urging vocational 
education, is destined to be proved. right or wrong. The upbuilding 
after the war— 
is to be economic as well as spiritual, but those who think out most deeply the 
need of the economic situation are most surely convinced that the problems of 
industry and commerce are at the bottom human problems and can not find 
solution without a new sense of “ cooperation and brotherliness,” ? 
: SALARIES AND PENSIONS. 
SALARIES OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL-TEACHERS,® 
The problem of maintaining an adequate supply of elementary- 
school teachers was already becoming serious in England and Wales 
before the war; the outbreak of the war and its continued duration 
have only served to intensify the crisis. A large proportion of the

  60 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
men had joined the army, and many women had been attracted to 
occupations which appeared to be more obviously connected with the 
war activities and to offer higher remuneration than teaching. 
At the same time the war imposed additional burdens, willingly 
assumed but none the less demanding sacrifices, on the teachers; 
these took the form of. larger classes, extra work in the school, volun- 
tary war work of different kinds, and so on. Not the least of the 
hardships was the depreciation of salaries due to the rising cost of 
living which by 1917 had increased about 80 per cent above that of 
1914. Education authorities were confronted with several problems— 
inability to retain teachers in the face of more attractive oppor- 
tunities elsewhere, inability to secure an adequate supply of candidates 
ready to undertake several years of training at a time when remunera- 
tive occupations were open to them without training, and inability 
to find additional resources when the public purse was otherwise being 
drained to meet other demands. 
The first response was to grant bonuses on salary, which never went 
beyond an annual addition of 10 per cent, and rarely affected salaries 
above $1,000 or $1,250 a year. Such increases were of course quite 
incommensurate with the needs of the time, especially when skilled 
workmen could command as much as $75 a week, and boys still under 
18 about $15 a week for unskilled services. 
In only one important respect was the stringency relieved by a 
Government prohibition against the increase of rents. The bonus 
system prevailed until about the middle of 1917, when the Govern- 
ment came to the rescue with an addition to the educational budget 
of about $18,000,000, which was specially earmarked for salaries. At 
the same time the Board of Education issued a minute recommend- 
ing that the minimum salary for women teachers in elementary 
schools should be $450 and for men teachers $500. The effect of the 
additional Government grant was to stimulate the establishment of 
new scales of salary. 
In the meantime the Government had, in June, 1917, appointed a 
departmental committee to inquire into the principles which should 
determine the construction of scales of salary for teachers in ele- 
mentary schools, and another committee to make a similar inquiry 
into the salaries of secondary school teachers. The first committee 
issued its report in February, 1918.1. The report is based on three 
main principles: 
1. That “authorities, in constructing a scale should aim at obtaining a 
constant supply of suitable recruits, at retaining them while other careers are

  still open to them, and at securing service of the desired quality from those 
who make teaching their life work.” 
2. That the scale “shall provide them with a reasonable assurance of a re- 
muneration that will enable them to live appropriately without embarrassment, 
and that they may have a fair chance of advancement to posts of greater im- 
portance and emolument.” 
3. That “as authorities, in framing their scales are taking part in the work 
of establishing the teaching service of the country on a basis conducive to the 
efficiency of the system of national education, they should proceed upon a com- 
mon basis of principles.” 
The committee, while accepting the administrative advantages of 
a salary scale, recognized that special consideration must be given to 
rewarding teachers of exceptional ability, to dealing with teachers 
who drift into a rut, to withholding increments from those teachers 
who are reported to be inefficient. It further considered the question 
of equal pay for men and women, for which a strong agitation has 
been launched by women teachers throughout the country. Finally, 
attention was given to removing some of the inequalities in salaries 
paid to teachers in rural and urban areas. 
The chief principle adopted for the construction of salary scales 
was that a scale with smaller increments for the early years of service, 
followed by larger increments leading up to a salary adequate for 
increasing family responsibilities, and then with further prospects 
until retirement, is superior to a sharp, steep scale leading early up 
to a maximum, or a long and gradual scale which would not yield 
an adequate salary when responsibilities were greatest. For example, 
in the case of men certificated teachers annual increments are sug- 
gested for not less than 12 years, followed by increments at intervals 
of not more than 3 years for a further period of about 10 years, and 
for women certificated teachers annual increments for not less than 
8 years, followed by increments at longer intervals as in the case of 
men. Uncertificated teachers should have a short scale covering a 
period of 4 to 6 years and not rising above the minimum for women 
certificated teachers, with discretionary increments in cases of indi- 
vidual merit. 
Owing to the opposition of the teaching body, the committee was 
unable to recommend that increments should depend solely upon 
merit, and suggested that increments be automatic except in the case 
of definite default or willful neglect, with additional rewards for ex- 
ceptional merit. The committee was unable to accept the principle 
of equal pay for men and women, partly because a scale of salaries 
adequate for women is under present circumstances inadequate for 
men, and partly because it is essential to attract and retain suitable 
men in the profession. Accordingly, it advocated the principle that 
the minimum salaries. for both men and women should be approxi-
-P-A-G-E-62
62 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
mately the same, but that the maximum: for women should not be less 
than three-fourths of the maximum for men. 
With reference to rural and urban teachers the committee was of 
the opinion that service in the rural districts should be made finan- 
cially attractive and that accordingly salaries should be only a little 
lower than in urban areas. While the committee did not attempt to 
establish a national scale, it offered for consideration a number of 
illustrative scales, and emphasized the importance of avoiding such 
diversity that the larger school systems would draw teachers away 
from the smaller. 
The following illustrations of scale making for certificated teach- 
ers were offered: 
  Men.—(1) Minimum $500, rising by annual increments of $25 to $800 in the 
thirteenth year of service, and then by triennial increments of $50 to $950 in 
the twenty-second year of service. 
(2) Minimum $500, rising by annual increments of $25 to $700 in the ninth 
year of service, and then by annual increments of $50 to $900 in the thirteenth 
year of service, and then by triennial increments of $50 to $1,050 in the twenty- 
second year of service. 
(8) Minimum $500, rising by annual increments of $25 to $575 in the fourth 
year of service, then by annual increments of $50 to $1,050 in the fourteenth 
year of service, and then by-triennial increments of $50 to $1,200 in the twenty- 
third year of service. 
(4) Minimum $500, rising by annual increments of $25 to $600 in the fifth 
year of service, then by annual increments of $50 to $1,150 in the sixteenth 
year of service, and then by triennial increments. 
(5) Minimum $500, rising by annual increments of $50 to $1,200. in the six- 
teenth year of service, and then by triennial increments of $100 to $1,500 in the 
twenty-fifth year of service. 
Women—(1) Minimum $450, rising by annual increments of $25 to $650 
in the ninth year of service, and then by triennial increments of $50 to $750 in 
the thirteenth year of service. 
(2) Minimum $450, rising as in (1) to $650 in the ninth year of service, and 
then by one increment to $700 in the tenth year of service, and then by triennial 
increments to $850 in the nineteenth year of service. 
(3) Minimum $450, rising by annual increments of $25 to $600 in the seventh 
year of service, then by annual increments of $50 to $750 in the tenth year of 
service, and then by triennial increments of $50 to $900 in the nineteenth year 
of service. 
(4) Minimum $450, rising by annual increments of $25 to $550 in the fifth 
year of service, and then by annual increments of $50 to $750 in the eleventh 
year of service, and then by triennial increments of $50 to $1,000 in the twen- 
tieth year of service. 
(5) Minimum $450, rising as in (4) to $550, then by annual increments of 
$50 to $900 in the twelfth year of service, and then by triennial increments of 
$100 to $1,200 in the twenty-first year of service. 
The existing situation is indicated in a return on teachers’ salaries 
in public elementary schools issued by the Board of Education in 
1917. Of 36,827 certificated men teachers, only 18,332 were receiving 
salaries over $750 a year, while 7,040 received over $1,000 a year,
-P-A-G-E-63
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 63 
2,066 of over $1,250 a year, and only 1,866 over $1,500 a year; 2,629 
received less than the minimum of $500 a year prescribed for men. 
Of 77,139 certificated women teachers, 17,832 received less than the 
minimum of $450 preseribed, and 32,314 less than $500 a. year, while 
20,573 received more than $600 a year, 7,603 over $750, and only 1,269 
were in receipt of more than $1,000 a year. The certificated teachers 
represent the highest paid elementary school teachers. The situation 
is much worse in the case of uncertificated teachers, for of 3,546 men, 
only 128 received more than $500 a year, and of 35,979 women only 
89 received more than this sum. The proposals contained in the 
present report will, if carried into practice, not only raise the mini- 
mum salaries considerably above the present minimum rates, but 
will offer teachers the prospect of a maximum of more than twice 
the present average. To these prospects must be added the benefits 
of the superannuation act of 1918. 
. SALARIES FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The inadequacy of salaries paid to teachers in secondary and 
other schools of similar grade led in 1917 to the appointment of a 
departmental committee— 
To inquire into the principles which should determine the fixing of salaries 
for teachers in secondary and technical schools, schools of art, training colleges, 
and other institutions for higher education (other than university institutions), 
due regard being had to such differentiation in respect of locality, duties, 
qualifications, sex, and other relevant circumstances as is consistent with or 
necessary for the organization of teaching service throughout the country on 
a system conducive to the efficiency of national education. 
The commission, under the chairmanship of Sir H. L. Stephen, 
after taking the evidence of officials of the Board of Education and 
local education authorities, and of teachers and their associations, 
issued its report! in 1918. The report considers the character of the 
different types of institutions involved, discusses the principles 
determining the fixing of salaries, and includes a memorandum on 
the institutions falling within the terms of reference. The chief 
part of the report is devoted to a discussion of salaries in secondary 
schools. The salary question assumes particular importance at a 
time when there is urgent need for attracting and developing a strong 
teaching force. In spite of the fact that the institutions considered 
represent a great degree of variation in sources of maintenance and 
character of government, national standards must be maintained. 
“A national system of education may be indefinitely divided and sub- 
divided; but it must always be regarded as an organic unity the

-P-A-G-E-64

welfare of which depends upon the welfare of every recognizable 
division or subdivision.” The increasing competition with com- 
merce, industry, and the public services, all of which offer better 
opportunities than the teaching profession, which at present holds 
out prizes only for the few, renders the need of providing attractive 
inducements to prospective candidates more urgent than ever. At 
present, in the secondary schools that come under the survey of the 
Board of Education, only 460 out of the 1,050 institutions have 
established scales of salary. The majority of the 460 schools are 
under public authorities, thus leaving a vast number of small en- 
dowed and private schools with inadequate provisions for the finan- 
cial welfare of teachers. 
The advantages of scales of salaries outweigh any disadvantages 
that they may involve. A scale assures to the teachers certain finan- 
cial prospects and defines the liabilities of the school authorities. It 
relieves teachers of the perpetual anxiety of financial embarrassment, 
while securing a larger and better supply of candidates. The chief 
disadvantages, such as the unfairness of treating all teachers alike, 
and the lack of stimulus for. the exceptionally able, can be offset by 
introducing elasticity in the administration of the scale and estab- 
lishing posts of responsibility. In order to secure as homogeneous 
a body of teachers as possible for any one branch of education, pos- 
sessing similar qualifications, academic and professional, a national 
scale would be the ideal to be attained. In view of the great varia- 
tions in the organization and administration of schools, the commis- 
sion was not able to advocate a national scale. The units of scales 
must necessarily remain the same, some applying only to a single 
school, others to all the schools maintained by a local authority. A 
national scale prescribed by a central authority would be inconsistent 
with existing arrangements. The imposition of a national scale is 
impossible without a national guarantee, which the commission was 
not empowered to discuss. Of three plans suggested, namely, (1) the 
prescription of a complete scale with initial salary, increments, and 
maximum; (2) the establishment of a minimum initial salary with 
a minimum to be reached at one point at least later in the scale; and 
(3) the prescription of only a minimum salary, the commission se- 
lected and advocated the second. This plan the commission considers 
will provide a certain common measure among all scales, leaving local 
units to frame such steps on the scale and to provide such maxima 
as suit their circumstances. There is very little doubt that this 
recommendation will not be considered satisfactory, and it may be 
pointed out that the commission’s suggestion was contrary to the 
opinions presented to it, for “most of the witnesses who have ap- 
peared before us, and have considered this matter, are in favor of such
-P-A-G-E-65
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 65 
a scale (national) being introduced in all secondary schools that re- 
ceive public money.” 
In dealing with the question of equal pay for both sexes, for which 
justification may be found by some in the requirement of similar 
qualifications and efficiency from both men and women teachers, and 
in the fact that needs of both may be the same in’ meeting certain 
personal obligations, in providing for leisure and self-improvement, 
and in saving for old age, the commission is of the opinion that there 
must be differentiation of scales on the basis of sex. At present “a 
salary that will attract a woman will not necessarily attract a man 
of similar qualifications.” Since salaries must be sufficiently high 
to attract and retain the services of qualified teachers, the fact must 
be taken into consideration that there are more openings in com- 
merce and industry, and in the professional and public services for 
men than for women, that as a general rule men are likely to give 
longer service, and that, while the prospect of marriage may be the 
same for both sexes marriage for the man implies the assumption of 
new financial responsibilities. The commission considers that “ under 
present economic and social conditions the principle of equality of 
pay for the two sexes would lead to the one being underpaid or the 
other overpaid.” It is accordingly suggested that scales of salary 
should be approximately the same in the initial stages for both men 
and women, but that differences imposed by differences of economic 
and social status should be introduced at later stages. 
The construction of scales of salary gives rise to the question of 
their length and the frequency of increments. A national scale 
should imply a minimum initial salary rising by annual increments 
to a substantial salary at the age of 32 or 33, and a maximum at the 
age of 42 or 48. It is also suggested that at some intermediate point 
in a scale there should be another minimum that can be attained 
by most teachers. A review of past services is recommended be- 
fore teachers are advanced to the highest point of a scale. The 
initial salary should not be so high as to render the maximum unat- 
tractive, and the maximum should be attainable at an age when it 
will serve to retain experienced teachers, and leave them some years 
for its enjoyment. The increments should be granted automatically, 
subject to satisfactory service and conduct. Where an increment is 
withheld, a teacher should be informed of the cause and be given an 
opportunity to defend himself. In order to meet cases of special 
ability, whether in teaching or administration, scales should be 
sufficiently elastic to enable authorities to offer suitable financial 
recognition of special merit. Additional salaries must be provided 
for assistant principals and heads of departments. Another element 
of flexibility that it may be desirable to consider may arise out of 
171030°—21—Bull. 89 —5
-P-A-G-E-66
66 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  differences in local conditions in such matters as the cost of living 
and rents. Other differentiations that will necessarily arise under 
existing conditions may follow from differences in academic and pro- 
fessional training and length of experience. The commission holds 
that for appointment in a secondary school a university degree and 
one year of professional training are essential. Other matters, such 
as differentiation on the basis of the subject taught, or the char- 
acter or size of a school, should not, in the opinion of the commis- 
sion, lead to variation in scales. So far as possible, in the interests . 
of national education, differences between different schools in the 
establishment of salary scales should be eliminated. The commission 
strongly urges the more general establishment of “ grace terms” or 
leave of absence on full pay, for purposes of study or research, with- 
out affecting the continuity of the scales or the future prospects of 
teachers. 
These recommendations are not intended to apply to the salaries 
of principals. For these, personal scales reaching a high maximum 
within a short time should be established. Here the size of the school 
and character of the work to be done should be taken into con- 
sideration. The commission wisely deprecates the practice of paying 
principals by capitation fees and the system by which principals 
or assistants make a profit by taking boarders. 
The standards advocated for the establishment of salary scales for 
secondary school teachers are also recommended for the other institu- 
tions that come within the terms of reference, in so far as the same 
qualifications are needed as in the secondary schools. Where special 
factors, such as competition with opportunities in commerce and 
industry in the case of certain teachers in technical and art schools, 
must be taken into account, personal scales are advocated.

In addition to salary scales, which will probably be put into effect 
under the broad powers intrusted to the Board of Education, sec- 
ondary school-teachers in grant-earning schools are eligible to the 
pension benefits provided under the superannuation act of 1918. 
TEACHERS’ SUPERANNUATION ACT OF 1918. 
The urgent need of securing men and women to promote that 
development of education for which the act prepares the way, has 
not only directed attention to the question of salaries, but has 
prompted the Government to introduce a system of pensions for all 
grades of teachers. Whatever may be the result of the recommenda- 
tions of the committees appointed to consider salaries, a pension 
system has already been established by the school-teachers’ (super- 
annuation) act, passed in November, 1918. The main purpose of 
the act is to attract men and women to the teaching profession by 
giving them “that sense of elasticity and freedom from care, which 
is essential to the proper discharge of their duties.” By extending 
the benefits of the act to teachers in all schools aided by the State, 
the act will also promote the unity of the profession, and will to this 
extent supplement the efforts of the Teachers’ Registrati6n Council. 
Combined with adequate salary scales, the pension system should con- 
tribute to an improvement in the qualifications of teachers. 
The act provides benefits for teachers in all grant-aided institutions 
below the grade of universities or university colleges. These include 
elementary, secondary, and technical schools, training colleges for 
teachers, and other institutions in receipt of aid from the State. 
Teachers will become eligible for the superannuation allowance at 
the age of 60 after 30 years of qualifying service, of which at least 
10 years must be recognized service in a grant-aided school. The age  
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
of retirement is the same for men and women, but in the case of 
women who withdraw from service to marry and later return to 
teaching, the period of qualifying service is reduced to 20 years. 
The distinction between qualifying and recognized service permits 
migration to and from grant-aided schools to schools not on the 
grant list, but all service in the following types of schools is ex- 
cluded: (a) Schools conducted for private profit, (b) schools not 
open to inspection by the Board of Education, and not shown to 
the satisfaction of the board to be efficient; (¢) schools able out of 
their own resources to maintain a satisfactory pension scheme, and 
(d) schools which do not satisfy such other conditions as may be 
prescribed as necessary or desirable for securing the public interest. 
The amount of the retirement allowance is one-eightieth of average 
salary for each year of recognized service, or one-half of the average 
salary, whichever is the less. In addition a gratuity will be given 
in a lump sum of one-thirtieth of average salary for each year of 
recognized service, or one and a half times the average salary, which- 
ever is the less. Disability allowances of one-twelfth of average sal- 
ary for each year of recognized service will be paid after 10 years of 
service to teachers incapable of further service by reason of infirmity 
of mind or body. In the case of death after five years of recognized 
service a death gratuity will be paid to the legal representatives of 
a deceased teacher of an amount not exceeding the average salary; 
where a teacher dies after retirement without having received an 
amount equal to his average salary on account of his superannuation 
allowance and the additional allowance, the board may grant to his 
legal representatives a gratuity not exceeding the difference between 
these two sums. 
The act abolishes the deferred annuity system under the acts of 
1898 to 1912, but annuities will be paid in respect to contributions 
already made and teachers are given the option of continuing their 
contributions.or of coming under the new scheme. Local pension 
schemes are similarly abolished and contributions are to be returned 
to the teachers, unless they desire to forego the benefits of the act. 
The administration of the act is in the hands of the Board of 
Education, which is empowered to frame rules for this purpose. The 
board may refuse or reduce allowances in cases of misconduct of 
teachers. Its decisions on the application of the act are final. In 
the words of the act: 7 
Nothing in this act shall give any person an absolute right to any superan- 
nuation allowance or gratuity, and, except as in this act provided, the decision 
of the board on any question which may arise as to, or which may affect, the 
application of the act to any person, or the qualification for any superannua- 
-tion allowance or gratuity, or the amount of any superannuation allowance or 
gratuity, or any questions which may arise as to the amount of the average 
salary of any teacher shall be final,

EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 69 
In thus establishing a noncontributory pension’system Mr. Fisher 
has departed from the tendency which has been very generally ac- 
cepted in the establishment of local pension systems in Great Britain, 
in many parts of the British Empire, and in the United States. It is 
estimated that the cost of the scheme in about 10 years will be 
$10,000,000 a year, but as no actuarial investigation has been made, 
this figure is nothing more than an estimate, which is particularly 
dangerous at a time when salary rates are changing and show an 
upward tendency. However, the Government is protecting itself 
by the provision that there is “no claim to superannuation allowances 
or gratuities as of right.” As a measure for meeting the immediate 
demand for teachers the act will undoubtedly serve this purpose, as 
it will also tend to promote unity among teachers, and raise the 
standards of instruction in schools, service in which is excluded under 
the act. The history of other noncontributory pension systems 
does not, however, offer a sound guaranty of the future success of 
the present act. 
ADULT. EDUCATION. 
Of the many reports on education that have appeared during the 
war period, none goes more thoroughly into the problem and none 
is more significant than the interim report of the committee on adult 
education, which was appointed by the Minister of Reconstruction, 
“to consider the provision for, and possibilities of, adult education 
(other than technical or vocational) in Great Britain, and to make 
recommendations.” Reaching the conclusion that industrial and social 
reforms are necesary to make adult education possible and effective, 
the committee issued the present interim report on industrial and 
social conditions in relation to adult education.t 
The committee points out that “there is a wide and growing de- 
mand among adults for education of a nonvocational character,” 
accompanied among the working classes by considerable suspicion of 
“technical” education. The motives underlying the demand for 
education are based partly “upon a claim for the recognition of 
human personality,” partly upon a desire to become “ better fitted for 
the responsibilities of membership in political, social, and industrial 
organizations.” The new problems that will confront democratic 
societies everywhere in all branches of organized life will demand 
intelligent participation on the part of men and women of all classes, 
and since many of these problems are of such a nature that they can 
be grasped only after experience with the world, the committee is of 
the opinion that “ facilities for adult education must therefore be 
regarded as permanently essential, whatever developments there may 
be in the education of children and adolescents.”

Relation to Adult Education. Cd. 9107 (London, 1918),
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 BIENNIAL: SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Although a discussion of the question of adult education is re- 
served for a subsequent report, a general survey of the exist- 
ing facilities is presented. These cover a remarkable array of 
activities and include besides the well-known University Extension 
Lecture System, the University Tutorial Class Movement, the Work- 
ers’ Educational Association, Ruskin College and the Labor College, 
a number of organizations like the Adult School Movement, the 
Cooperative Societies’ educational work, working men’s colleges, 
clubs, summer courses, and libraries, as well as the more formal work 
of the local education authorities. The war has stimulated an inter- 
est in the historical background and causes of the war and in the 
problems of reconstruction. But extensive as the facilities have been, 
their reach has not been universal. “ What is needed is some organi- 
zation sufficiently comprehensive and systematic to bring facilities 
for higher education within the reach of the inhabitants of every 
town and village in the country.” 
The most significant and valuable contribution of the report is 
the analysis of the industrial and social conditions that militate 
against the effectual operation of a system of adult education, how- 
ever well organized and financed. The survey of these conditions 
inevitably leads to recommendations which, if accepted, may alter 
the whole face of industrial and economic life in England. The 
report presents a treatment of educational politics that is altogether 
too rare and infrequent. Excessive hours of work, overtime, the 
shift system, and night work are all obstacles that must be overcome 
before adequate consideration can be given to the problem referred 
to the committee. “From the point of view of education and of 
participation in public activities (which we regard as one of the 
most valuable means of education),” declares the committee, “ we 
are of opinion that one of the greatest needs is the provision of a 
greater amount of leisure time; this is the more necessary because 
of the increasing strain of modern life.” A shorter working day 
will go far to protect the worker against the worst consequences of 
monotonous toil, but this should be supplemented by alternating 
forms of employment and opportunities for the exercise of initiative. 
“The more industry becomes a matter of machinery, the more neces- 
‘sary it becomes to humanize the working of the industrial system.” 
With the improvement of these conditions there still remains the 
problem of coping with heavy and exhausting work, whose depress- 
ing effects can be increasingly counteracted by the introduction of 
mechanical devices, and the prevalence of which, if such conditions 
can not be ameliorated, would not be tolerated in the light of ade- 
quate publicity. The introduction of a reasonable holiday without 
stoppage of pay for all workers in town and country, the committee
-P-A-G-E-71
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. T1 
believes, “would have a beneficial effect upon the national life.” 
Finally, the fear of unemployment which— 
hangs like a heavy cloud over so many breadwinners brings a sense of inse- 
curity into the life of the worker and deprives him of all incentives to take 
a whole-hearted interest in the various activities which are a necessary accom- 
paniment of a complete life. : 
The progressive increase in productivity that has characterized the 
development of industry in the last generation has resulted in spe- 
cialized, mechanical, and monotonous labor, with the consequent 
stunting of the creative impulse and of the spirit of craftsmanship 
and the deprivation of opportunities for self-expression, These con- 
ditions react on human personality in so far as “the present indus- 
trial system offers little opportunity for the satisfaction of the in- 
tellectual, social, and artistic impulses.” The committee accordingly 
urges the need for a new industrial outlook: 
Adult education and, indeed, good citizenship, depend in no small degree, 
therefore, upon a new orientation of our industrial outlook and activities. 
Improved conditions and the diffusion of responsibility for the proper conduct 
of industry will strengthen the need for educational opportunities. In so far 
as that need is fulfilled, industry will gain by a more effective “ industrial citi- 
zenship,” and will itself become more truly educative. Thus increased oppor- 
tunities for adult education and the stimulus of a freer and finer industrial 
environment are correlative and help to develop each other. Education is to 
be measured essentially in terms of intellectual accomplishment, power of 
esthetic appreciation, and moral character, and these have little or no oppor- 
tunity for realization except through a harmonious environment. Nor is the 
environment likely to be substantially modified except in response to the higher 
ideals of social life, stimulated by a more prolonged and widely diffused edu- 
cation. 
Addressing itself to the problem of improving the environment, 
the committee emphasizes the importance of the preparation of 
schemes of housing, town planning, and public health by the cooper- 
ation of experts and representatives of the people for whom such 
schemes are intended, especially women, to whom an adequate 
scheme of housing reform will bring an improvement in conditions 
without which they will be unable to play their new part in public 
affairs. For the improvement of rural life, measures are needed 
beyond the necessary improvement of labor conditions. A com- 
munal organization that will promote vigorous intellectual and 
social life in the country districts is essential. To this end the com- 
mittee recommends the provision of a hall under public control with 
a village institute providing for many-sided activities as the ideal 
to be aimed at. 
In conclusion, the committee is under no delusions as to the possi- 
bility of putting its recommendations into early practice. It does 
draw attention to the fact that at this turning-point in England’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  
  72 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
national history “ it is in our power to make the new era one of such 
progress as to repay us even for the immeasurable cost, the price in 
lives lost, in manhood crippled, and in homes desolated.” The war 
has generated a new spirit which must be utilized immediately as a 
foundation for the future. 
We have awakened to the splendid qualities that were latent in our people, 
the rank and file of the common people, who before this war were often 
adjudged .to be decadent, to have lost their patriotism, their religious faith, and 
their response to leadership; we were even told they were physically degen- 
erate. Now we see what potentialities lie in this people and what a charge lies 
upon us to give these powers free play. There is stirring through the whole 
country a sense of the duty we owe to our children, and to our grandchildren 
to save them not only from the repetition of such a world war and from the 
burdens of a crushing militarism, but to save them also from the obvious peril 
of civil dissension at home. We owe it also to our own dead that they shall not 
have died in vain, but that their sacrifice shall prove to have created a better 
England for the future generation. 
EDUCATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION AND PUBLIC OPINION. 
The dislocation caused in the social, economic, and educational 
life of the country by the outbreak of the war has already been men- 
tioned. For a time events of larger moment that were happening in 
France tended to overshadow the discussion of domestic problems. 
In the attempts to understand the German enigma, however, it was 
inevitable that attention should be turned to the German educational 
system and that comparisons should be instituted between that and 
the English. It was not many months before a fierce controversy 
broke out between the classicists and the scientists in which the advo- 
cates of modern language studies soon joined. But the dissatisfac- 
tion that began to find voice was not confined to higher education; 
it spread very naturally to the elementary schools and expressed 
itself in criticism of the school attendance regulations, of the early 
exemptions, of the lack of advanced work in the upper grades, and 
particularly of the absence of provision for the large class of boys 
and girls who are allowed to drift after leaving the elementary 
schools. The dissatisfaction and criticism were not new; they had 
already been heard before the war; but as soon as it became clear that 
the war was one of conflicting ideals, they received at once a new 
stimulus and a new focus or objective. The shortcomings of English 
education began to be measured by their adequacy for training 
healthy, moral, and intelligent citizens of a democracy. In dis- 
cussing the “ Outlook for 1914” the Times Educational Supplement 
in January of that year wrote: 
Like English poetry and English painting, our education is astir with new 
ideas. These new ideas are not all of one pattern, but often discordant with 
one another, the offspring of different stocks, and as diverse as the roots from
-P-A-G-E-73
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. #3 
which they spring, though novel in their combinations and sometimes one-sided 
in their emphasis. 
The war helped to furnish a rallying and unifying point for the 
new ideas and stimulated a widespread interest in education which 
was not present even three months before the outbreak of the war, 
and certainly not in 1911, when Mr. Runciman presented the school 
and continuation class attendance bill, or when the several efforts 
were made to abolish the half-time system. 
It was less than a year after England’s entrance into the war when 
discontent and criticism began to make way for the discussion of a 
constructive program. In May, 1915, the Times Educational Supple- 
ment propounded the question, “ How can the educational institu-\ 
tions of the country be molded and developed to fit the childhood of 
the nation to meet wisely the problems of the Great Peace?” and in 
the same month Mr. Pease, shortly before retiring from the office of 
president of the Board of Education, emphasized the urgent need 
of longer schooling, greater opportunities, and closer relations be- 
tween scientific research and industry. It began to be generally ac- 
cepted that the appointed hour for reform had arrived. “If we are 
to face the future with any confidence after this exhausting war,” 
wrote the Times, “we must face it as an educated people. We shall 
not be able to afford to waste the efficiency of a single English child.” 
By the close of 1915 the reform movement was in full swing, and by 
the middle of the following year the Times was able to report that 
“it is certain that there is not now a place in England where educa- 
tional affairs are considered that is not agog with the demand for 
reform.” : 
The consideration of plans for educational reconstruction was not 
confined to the teaching profession. The problem occupied the atten- 
tion of leaders of the working classes, local and national trade-union 
bodies, manufacturers and employers, and the public in general. 
Early in 1916, the Athenaeum, hitherto devoted almost ‘exclusively 
to literature, changed its character and dedicated its pages to the 
consideration of the broader phases of reconstruction. Later in the 
same year the Times Educational Supplement, until then a monthly 
magazine, decided to appear weekly “in the hope of enabling the pub- 
lic, which is now bent upon educational reform, to take an instructed 
part in the process.” : 
The Trade-Union Congress, meeting in Birmingham early in Sep- 
tember, 1916, passed resolutions protesting against the employment 
of children in agricultural work, factories, and workshops, and 
against any reduction in the expenditure on education, and pledged 
itself to support all measures to secure a higher standard of educa- 
tion for all children. The British Labor Party, in the program of 
reconstruction issued at the close of 1917, emphasized the demands
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
for health, leisure, education, and subsistence, and urged the appli- 
cation of national funds“ for the education alike of children, of adoles- 
cents, and of adults, in which the labor party demands a genuine 
equality of opportunity, overcoming all differences of material cir- 
cumstances.” The general secretary of the Workers’ Educational 
Association, Mr. J. M. Mactavish, had already given a more detailed 
definition of these demands in a pamphlet on What Labor Wants 
from Education: 
Labor wants from education health and full development for the mind, fine- 
ness for the feelings, good will toward its kind, and, coupled with this liberal 
education, such a training as will make its members efficient, self-supporting 
citizens of a free self-governing community. Such an education and only such 
an education will meet the needs of the individual, the class, the nation, and 
the race. 
Mr. Fisher, appreciating the influence of labor in the development 
of public opinion on education, paid a tribute to the leaders in the 
introduction to his Educational Reform Speeches. “The leaders 
of the labor world, having discovered education some time since, are 
now communicating the message to those below.” : 
To these expressions of faith on behalf of labor there deserve to be 
added the views of the more enlightened employers. After the 
introduction of Mr. Fisher’s first bill Messrs. Tootal, Broadhurst, Lee 
Co. (Ltd.), of Manchester and London, issued four pamphlets? 
urging the support of the bill. The platform that they insisted upon 
was the following: 
We believe that the vast majority of the nation favor the main proposals 
of the new education bill, viz, 1. Whole-time education up to the age of 14. 
2. Compulsory part-time education up to 18. 
Over and above these proposals a straight road to the university should be 
open to those who desire the fullest development of their intellect. Only by 
such provision for complete knowledge of the arts and sciences can we as a 
nation maintain our place in the world. 
It is important for the opponents of the bill to realize that the two proposals 
we have mentioned are regarded by educationists as merely a first step to 
a real system of democratic education. 
They are by no means exhorbitant proposals. They represent in fact a 
minimum of democracy’s demand for a fuller life. They do nothing more than 
give a reasonable chance to the children of this country to make the best of 
themselves. 
Local reconstruction committees began to be formed and a large 
number of professional associations devoted themselves to the task 
of drafting plans of reforms, while the daily press gave increasing 
attention to the subject. “Nothing has been more remarkable,” said   
1¥Fisher, H. A. L. Educational Reform Speeches (Oxford, 1918). 
2 These appeared first as advertisements in the country’s press. They were published 
under the title “The Great Decision,” and included four pamphlets: Now or Never, Our 
Success or Failure, A Just Complaint, and A First Step. Messrs, Cadbury, of Bourn- 
ville, followed a similar policy.
-P-A-G-E-75
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 75 
Mr. Fisher in introducing his first educational estimate in 1917, “ than 
the attention which has recently been paid, both in the public press 
and on public platforms, to the subject of education.” 
Among the professional associations the following issued proposals 
for educational reconstruction: 
Assistant Masters Association (Educational Policy). 
Directors and Secretaries for Education (Toward an Educational Policy). 
Teachers of Domestic Subjects (Memorandum). 
Education Committees (Report of Executive). 
Education Officers’ Association (Policy). 
Education Reform Council (Education Reform). 
Headmasters’ Association (Educational Policy). 
Headmistresses Conference. 
British Science Guild (National Education). 
‘Teachers’ Registration Council (Resolutions). 
Technical Institutions Association. 
Workers’ Educational Association (Educational Reconstruction). 
National Union of Teachers (Educational Progress). 
London County Council Education Committee (Education after the War— 
Government Grants and Educational Development). 
The suggestions and recommendations of some of these bodies re- 
ceived wide publicity and consideration. Many of these recommen- 
dations, as well as the proposals contained in a draft bill, which 
appeared in the Times Educational Supplement of March 15, 1917, 
were embodied in the act as finally passed. 
The Government in the meantime was not neglecting the subject 
of education. It was recognized that the reform of education could 
not be considered in isolation but must fit in with the general plan 
for national reconstruction. The subject of reconstruction was for 
a time intrusted to a committee consisting of members of the Cabinet, 
but it soon became clear that such a committee could not devote to 
the problem the attention that it deserved. In March, 1917, a new 
committee of reconstruction was appointed with the Prime Minister 
as chairman and Mr. E. S. Montague as executive head. Four months 
later the province of the committee was further expanded and under 
the new ministries act of 1917 a ministry of reconstruction was estab- 
lished. According to the Report of the War Cabinet, for 1917, 
page xix— 
The scope of its activities covers almost every branch of the national life. 
It has been concerned not only with the problems which will arise immediately 
on the return of peace, such as the demobilization of the armies and reconver- 
sion to peace production of many industries now making war material; it has 
also to consider education, the supply and distribution of raw material, a great 
scheme for the better housing of the people both in town and country, labor 
and industrial problems, transportation, national health, and so forth. 
For a time it was expected that a royal commission would be ap- 
pointed to consider proposals for educational reform, but at the end 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  
  76 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
of June, 1916, it was announced that the problem of education would 
come within the scope of the cabinet committee of reconstruction. 
Education, however, constituted but one of 15 different branches of 
activities, the consideration of which was intrusted to 87 distinct 
committees. It was clear that even the adoption of this course would 
involve delay, and it does not appear that this plan was eventually 
carried out, with the exception that a number of separate problems 
were left for consideration by the section of the Ministry of Recon- 
struction in charge of education. The following committees were 
established and placed under this ministry (the appointing authori- 
ties and the dates of the reports, if they have already been issued, 
are given in parentheses) : 
Royal Commission on University Education in Wales. (The Crown; Cd. 
8991 and Cd. 8993; 1918.) 
Adult Education Committee. (Ministry of Reconstruction; Cd. 9107; 1918.) 
Committee on Juvenile Education in Relation to Employment after the War. 
(Board-of Education ; Cd. 8512 and Cd. 8577; 1917.) 
Committee on the Teaching of Modern Languages. (The Prime Minister; Cd. 
9036; 1918.) 
Committee on the Teaching of Science. (The Prime Minister; Cd. 9011; 
1918.) 
Committee on Principles of Arrangements Determining Salaries of Teachers 
in Blementary Schools. (Board of Education; Cd. 8939; 1918.) 
Committee on Principles of Arrangement, Determining Salaries of Teachers 
in Secondary, Technical, ete, Schools. (Board of Education; Cd. 9140; 
1918. ) 
Juvenile Organizations Committee. (Home Office.) 
It will be seen that most of these committees have already reported, 
and an account of these reports is given elsewhere. 
The Government had also entered upon new developments in 
another direction—the promotion of scientific and industrial research. 
In 1915, under a scheme for the organization and development of 
scientific and industrial research (Cd. 8005, 1915), there were estab- 
lished a committee of the Privy Council responsible for expenditure 
of any new moneys provided by Parliament for such research, and a 
small advisory council composed of eminent men of science and 
others actually engaged in industries dependent upon scientific coop- 
eration. On December 1, 1916, the committee and council were re- 
placed by a Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. The 
object of this new development is indicated in the statement that: 
It appears incontrovertible that if we are to advance or even maintain our 
industrial position, we must as a nation aim at such a development of scientific 
and industrial research as will place us in a position to expand and strengthen 
our industries and to compete successfully with the most ‘highly organized of 
our rivals.

EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. TK 
The scope of the department’s activities is to consider— 
(1) Proposals for instituting scientific researches; (2) proposals for estab- 
lishing or developing special institutions or departments of existing institu- 
tions for the scientific study of problems affecting particular industries and 
trades; (3) the establishment and award of research studentships and fellow- 
ships. 
The department has begun active cooperation with scientific soci- 
eties, institutions, trades, and industries, and has already stimulated 
the establishment of research associations maintained by local indus- 
tries either independently or in cooperation with local universities. 
The task devolving as a consequence upon members of the depart- 
ment is thus described in the scheme under which the original com- 
mittee and advisory council were established: 
A large part of their work will be that of examining, selecting, combining, 
and coordinating, rather than of originating. One of the chief functions will 
be the prevention of overlapping between institutions or individuals engaged 
in research. They will, on the other hand, be at liberty to institute inquiries 
preliminary to preparing or eliciting proposals for useful research, and in this 
way they may help to concentrate on problems requiring solution the interest 
of- all persons concerned in the development of all branches of scientific 
industry. 
The establishment of the department represents the realization of 
some of the proposals and recommendations made by the committee 
to inquire into the position of natural science. 
Associated with this movement is the report of the subcommittee 
on relations between employers and employed on joint standing in- 
dustrial councils (Cd. 8606, 1917). This report, more generally 
known as the Whitley Committee Report, is not directly educational, 
but in its development it will exercise a tremendous influence in ex- 
panding the scope of education for the working classes. The com- 
mittee recommends the establishment of national, district, and works 
committees or councils, consisting of representatives of employers 
and employees, and of the associations of the former and trades- 
unions of the latter. 
The object is to secure cooperation by granting to workpeople a greater 
share in the consideration of matters affecting their industry, and this can 
only be achieved by keeping employers and workpeople in constant touch. 
Among some of the questions that the committee suggests for the 
consideration of such councils are (1) the better utilization of the 
practical knowledge and experience of workpeople; (2) technical 
training and education; (3) industrial research and the full utiliza- 
tion of the results; (4) the provision of facilities for the full con- 
sideration and utilization of inventions and improvements designed 
by workpeople, and for adequate safeguarding of the rights of de- 
signers of such improvements; and (5) improvements of processes,

machinery, and organization and appropriate questions referring to 
the management and the examination of industrial experiments, 
with special reference to cooperation in carrying new ideas into 
effect and full consideration of the point of view of the employees 
with reference to them. The educational implications are obvious. 
If the working classes are to avail themselves of the new position 
with which they will be endowed by the establishment of councils, 
they must also avail themselves of all the educational opportunities. 
that the Nation can put at their disposal. The burden is thus placed 
finally on the Nation to provide as extensive facilities as possible to 
equip every boy and girl for the new industrial conditions. Many 
industrial councils have already been established, and for educa- _ 
tional administration it is significant that teachers are demanding the 
setting up of joint councils representing the active teaching profes- 
sion and the education committees that employ them. 
Finally, it would be equally impossible to leave out of an account 
of the social background that led up to the education act reference 
to the passing of the Representation of the People Act early in 1918, 
which extends the franchise to about two million additional male 
and six million new female voters. It is estimated that the numbers 
of persons qualified under the act to vote is about one-third of the 
population, or about ten million men and six million women. At 
the same time the university franchise has been extended and the 
number of seats in the House of Commons raised by redistribution 
from 670 to 707. Again, as throughout the nineteenth century, 
every extension of the franchise has been followed, very closely in the 
present case, by an extension of educational opportunities. It is 
inevitable that the evolution of political democracy should be accom- 
panied by the expansion of a democratic system of education, for 
“the same logic which leads us to desire an extension of the fran- 
chise points also to an extension of education.” 
By the close of 1916 the stage was set for the introduction of the 
proposals for educational reconstruction. The problem had been 
canvassed from every direction and every point of view. The mental 
attitude that then separated the ultimate conception of the problem 
from the conception of the education problem in 1902 and 1906 
could hardly be measured by the number of years that separated 
the two periods. The denominational question has, as Lord Haldane 
had predicted earlier, vanished in comparison with the really vital 
problems; the nation was united in conceiving the task of educational 
reform in the terms so appropriately set forth by the departmental 
committee on juvenile education in relation to employment after 
the war. 
Any inquiry into education at the present juncture is big with issues of na- 
tional fate. In the great work of reconstruction which lies ahead there are
-P-A-G-E-79

aims to be set before us which will try, no less searchingly than war itself, 
the temper and enduring qualities of our race; and in the realization of each 
and all of these, education, with its stimulus and its discipline, must be our 
stand-by. We have to perfect the civilization for which our men have shed 
their blood and our women their tears; to establish new standards of value 
in our judgment of what makes life worth living, more wholesome and more 
restrained ideals of behavior and recreation, finer traditions of cooperation 
and kindly fellowship between class and class and between man and man. 
We have to restore the natural relations between the folk and the soil from 
which the folk derives its sustenance, to revivify with fresh scientific methods 
and better economic conditions the outworn practice of our agriculture, to 
learn over again that there is no greater public benefactor than the man who 
makes two ears of corn to grow where but one grew before. We have to 
bring research to bear upon the processes of our manufactures, to overhaul 
routine and eliminate waste, to carry our reputation for skillful workmanship 
and honest and intelligent trafficking into new markets and to maintain it 
in the old. These are tasks for a nation of trained character and robust 
physique, a nation alert to the things of the spirit, reverential of knowledge, 
reverential of its teachers, and generous in its estimate of what the production 
and maintenance of good teachers inevitably cost. Whether we are to be such 
a nation must now depend largely upon the will of those who have fought for 
us, and upon the conception which they have come to form of what education 
can do in the building up and glorifying of national life. For ourselves, we 
are content to leave it to that arbitrament. 
The recommendations of this committee were generally accepted 
as furnishing the framework for the educational legislation that was 
expected. (See p. 23.) 
It was under these conditions that Mr. H. A. L. Fisher was ap- 
pointed president of the Board of Education in December, 1916, His 
appointment was greeted with universal approval. It was an ap- 
pointment in which mere political considerations were subordinated 
to the great needs of the hour and of the office. In Mr. Fisher’s 
nomination the presidency of the Board of Education was filled by 
a man eminently equipped for the position, and not by a rising poli- 
tician for whom the Board of Education was to serve merely as a 
temporary stepping stone on the road to higher office. Mr. Fisher 
combines distinction as a scholar in his chosen field of history with 
an interest in popular education. His fellowship at New College, 
Oxford, had given him an experience with the problems of higher 
education that he was beginning to apply to the needs of one of the 
youngest universities. As vice-chancellor of the University of Shef- 
field he was inevitably brought into touch with needs and the de- 
mands of popular education. His grasp of the task to which he was 
called was strengthened by membership on a number of the commis- 
sions and committees to which reference has been made. The confi- 
dence of the country in his ability to carry out the task to a sucessful 
conclusion was soon to be justified by Mr. Fisher’s success jn pre- 
senting the problem to Parliament and to the country, and by his
-P-A-G-E-80
    80 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
adroit handling of all the obstacles and difficulties that stood in his 
way in spite of the readiness of the country for the reform proposals. 
Mr. Fisher at once addressed himself to the solution of the prob- 
lem intrusted to him. In February, 1917, he issued a stirring appeal, 
Sursum Corda, to the teachers of the country, in which he reminded 
them that: 
The proclamation of peace and victory in the field will summon us not to 
complacent repose, but to greater efforts for a more enduring victory. The 
future welfare of the Nation depends upon its schools. 
On April 19, 1917, he had an opportunity of testing the new faith 
of the country in education, when he introduced the education esti- 
mates in the House of Commons. The task of demanding from Par- 
liament an increase for 1917-18 of more than $19,000,000 over the 
estimate for the previous year, was one that would have deterred a 
parliamentarian of longer experience than Mr. Fisher, but the Parlia- 
ment of a country that was then spending about $35,000,000 a day 
on the work of destruction could not well refuse its consent to in- 
creased estimates for education: 
So that the foundations may be laid for a fabric of national education worthy 
of the genius and heroism of our people and a fitting monument of the great 
impulse which is animating the whole nation during the war. 
The chief part of the increase was to be devoted to securing “the 
first condition of educational advance,” the better payment of teach- 
ers, to the importance of which Mr. Fisher referred in the words: 
I do not expect the teaching profession to offer great material rewards— 
that is impossible; but I do regard it as essential to a good scheme of educa- 
tion that teachers should be relieved from perpetual financial anxieties, and 
that those teachers who marry should be able to look forward to rearing a 
family in respectable conditions. An anxious and depressed teacher is a bad 
teacher; an embittered teacher is a social danger. 
In the course of his speech Mr. Fisher foreshadowed the nature 
of the bill that he was shortly to introduce: 
The object which we are all striving to attain is very simple. We do not 
want to waste a single child. We desire that every child in the country should 
receive the form of education most adapted to fashion its qualities to the 
highest use. This will mean that every type and grade of school in the country 
must be properly coordinated. It will mean that the county authorities, 
either separately or combined together in provincial committees, should make 
complete and progressive schemes for education in their respective areas, so 
that adequate and systematic provision may be made not only for the ele- 
mentary, but also for technical, commercial, and secondary education of the 
children in the district. 
The unanimity with which the increased expenditure for educa- 
tion was received prepared the way for the education bill, which Mr. 
Fisher introduced on August 10, 1917. “The bill,” said Mr. Fisher, 
“is prompted by deficiencies which have been revealed by the war;
-P-A-G-E-81
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRI'TAIN AND IRELAND. 81 
it is framed to repair the intellectual wastage which has been caused 
by the war.” 
Into the details of the bill it is unnecessary to go; the causes of op- 
position to it are given in another section. But its introduction 
afforded Mr. Fisher another opportunity of declaring his educational 
faith. Striking throughout was his appreciation of the views of the 
leaders of the labor world: 
I notice also that a new way of thinking about education has sprung up 
among more reflecting members of our industrial army. They do not want 
education in order that they may rise out of their own class, always a vulgar 
ambition; they want it because they know that, in the treasures of the mind, 
they can find an aid to good citizenship, a source of pure enjoyment, and a 
refuge from the necessary hardships of a life spent in the midst of clanging 
machinery in our hideous cities of toil. 
The conclusion of his speech furnishes an admirable summary of 
the newly born recognition of the place of education in the national 
life: 
We assume that education is one of the good things of life which should be 
more widely shared than has hitherto been the case amongst the children and 
young persons of the country. We assume that education should be the educa- 
tion of the whole man, spiritually, intellectually, and physically, and that it 
is not beyond the resources of civilization to devise a scheme of education 
possessing certain common qualities, but admitting at the same time of large 
variation from which the whole youth of the country, male and femalg, may 
derive benefit. We assume that the principles upon which well-to-do parents 
proceed in the education of their families are valid also, mutatis mutandis, 
for the families of the poor; that the State has need to secure for its juvenile 
population conditions under which mind, body, and character may be harmo- 
niously developed. We feel also that in the existing circumstances the life of 
the rising generation can only be protected against the injurious effects of 
industrial pressure by a further measure of State compulsion. But we argue 
that the compulsion proposed in this bill will be no sterilizing restriction of 
wholesome liberty, but an essential condition of a larger and more enlightened 
freedom, which will tend to stimulate civic spirit, to promote general culture 
and technical knowledge, and to diffuse a steadier judgment and a better in- 
formed opinion through the whole body of the community. 
The closing months of the year were spent by Mr. Fisher in touring 
the country, particularly the manufacturing centers, for purposes of 
propaganda. Many employers had still to be won over to the idea 
of compulsory continuation schools; and much opposition had de- 
veloped against the bill among those concerned with the administra- 
tion of education. Deputations had to be met, compromises con- 
sidered, and the bill so amended that it would in effect become an 
accepted bill on its introduction. The first bill was withdrawn in 
January of 1918, and a new one took its place, with the elimination 
of those features to which objections had been raised. In introducing 
the second reading of the new bill on March 14, 1918, Mr. Fisher 
continued to maintain the high standards of statesmanship that 
171030°—21—Bull. 89 —6 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
‘marked his speeches on the first bill. His final plea for the passage 
of the bill will probably rank as the clearest and most far-sighted 
analysis of England’s need for educational reform that has been made. 
in the course of the last four years: 
The broad question before the House is whether the education provided for 
the general mass of our young citizens is adequate to our needs. We have been 
asking them to fight and work for their country, we have been asking them to 
die for their country, to economize for their country, to go short of food for 
their country, to work overtime for their country, to abandon trade-union rules. 
for their country, to be patient while towns are bombed from enemy aircraft, 
and family after family is plunged in domestic sorrow. We have now decided 
to enfranchise for the first time the women of this country. I ask then 
whether the education which is given to the great mass of our young citizens 
is adequate to the new, serious, and enduring liabilities which the develop- 
ment of this great world war created for our Empire, or to the new civic 
burdens which we are imposing upon millions of our peoples. I say it is not. 
adequate. I believe it is our duty here and now to improve our system of 
education, and I hold that, if we allow our vision to be blurred by a catalogue: 
of passing inconveniences, we shall not only lose a golden opportunity, but fail 
in our great trust to posterity. 
These words furnished a fitting climax to the campaign of nearly 
four years to change the opinion of a country from apathetic in- 
difference to education to the stage where almost the only criticisms. 
of the act which stands to Mr. Fisher’s credit come from those who 
feel that it does not go far enough. 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EDUCATION ACT, 1918, 
By the enactment on August 8 of the Fisher education bill the 
first step has been made toward the realization of the program of 
social and economic reconstruction that is to follow the war in 
England. For the reform of the English educational system, and 
of the Scottish system which is being provided for separately (see 
pp. 110ff) ,is but part of the larger task that has been intrusted to such 
bodies as the Ministry of Reconstruction or the Department on Scien- 
tific and Industrial Research. Without the sound foundations laid 
in the earlier years of school life, any recommendations that such 
bodies may make on adult education, public health, physical train- 
ing, unemployment, juvenile employment and apprenticeship, or 
cooperation between science and industry would inevitably remain 
nothing more than pious hopes. Educational reform in England 
to-day is also inevitably associated with the recent extension of the 
franchise, and indirectly will have some bearing on the recommenda- 
tions of the Whitley committee. Nor can the act be considered 
apart from the administrative changes already made by the Board

of Education, such as the regulations for advanced courses and 
examinations in secondary schools, from the Superannuation Act 
passed in November, 1918, or apart from departmental reports such 
as those on salaries for elementary and secondary school teachers, 
on the teaching of modern languages, or on the position of natural 
science in the schools. The quickened recognition by the public of 
the essential function of education in national life must also be taken 
into account as one of the assets for the future. Public interest and 
support have acquired an impetus from the conditions and realiza- 
_tions arising out of the war that has made possible such educational 
progress within one year as could in normal times not have been 
achieved in less than a generation. The sacrifices and public burdens 
undertaken by teachers of-all grades throughout the country have 
given them a repute and status that they have not hitherto enjoyed, 
and it will result in substantial improvement of their material 
position. The outlook of the local educational authorities has also 
been deeply affected by the urgent necessity of giving much closer 
attention than ever before to the educational problems under adverse 
conditions. Finally, although little is as yet known about its effects, 
the educational activities undertaken with the army will undoubtedly 
have a healthy reaction on that public opinion without which edu- 
cational progress is impossible. \ 
It is too often forgotten in recent discussions of English education 
that the train for “a comprehensive and progressive improvement of 
the educational system” had already been laid before the war in the 
budget speech of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on May 4, 1914. 
The act accordingly does not constitute a revolution in English edu- 
cation. It represents the normal development whose evolution has 
been hastened by the favorable conditions already described. After 
the satisfactory reception of the estimates for the Board of Educa- 
tion, introduced by Mr. Fisher in April, 1917, and calling for an 
increase of more than $18,000,000 over the estimates of the previous 
financial year, the passage of an education bill to meet the new 
demands, as formulated by numerous education authorities and asso- 
ciations of lay and professional men and women, was a foregone 
conclusion. Mr. Fisher’s first essay, however, a bill which he intro- 
duced in August, 1917, was from the first condemned to failure be- 
cause it exceeded these suggestions and recommendations and because 
it was suspected of being an attempt to conceal a scheme for cen- 
tralized control over education, behind a large number of measures 
otherwise acceptable. While the country was ready and willing to sur- 
render its rightstothe National Government in the interests of the con- 
duct of the war, it did not show itself so amenable in accepting what 
might prove to be a bureaucratic and centralized system of educational
-P-A-G-E-84

administration for all time. The education authorities were up in arms 
against the administrative measures and indicated in no uncertain 
terms their refusal to countenance any education bill at all that 
threatened their liberties or might interfere with local initiative and 
variety. In every case the administrative discretion of the Board of 
Education has been surrounded by limitations. Clause 4 of the 
first bill, which gave the board the final word in the approval or 
rejection of schemes submitted by the local education authorities, 
now becomes clause 5, and a definite procedure has been established 
in cases of conflict between a local education authority and the 
board, with final power vested in Parliament. The old clause 5, 
which provided for the combination of local areas into provincial 
associations in accordance with Lord Haldane’s proposals, has been 
dropped altogether, and the same fate met the old clause 29, which 
would have permitted the board to transfer the smaller to larger edu- 
cational areas. Clause 38 in the original bill also disappears and 
with it any danger that the board would become the final authority 
in cases of dispute with local authorities. Finally, the old clause 40 
now becomes clause 44, and the indefinite provisions for nationa! 
grants to education are replaced by a definite undertaking that these 
shall amount to not less than one-half of the local expenditure. A 
few additions and amendments have been made, in each case extend- 
ing rather than limiting the powers of local authorities. 
The general structure of the educational system remains the same 
as under the provisions of the Education Act of 1902, that is, the 
responsible authorities for elementary and higher education consist 
of counties and county borough councils, and for elementary educa- 
tion of the councils of noncounty boroughs and urban districts. The 
relation of the Board of Education to the local education authorities 
continues as hitherto with the broad exception that it now has the 
power of approving or rejecting schemes “for the progressive de- 
velopment and comprehensive organization of education” that may 
be submitted to it by the local education authorities. In cases of con- 
flict, between the board and a local authority the act provides for a 
conference or public inquiry, and in the last resort the submission of 
a report to Parliament with reasons for any action taken by the 
board. The grants from the national exchequer have been consoli- 
dated and will in the future be dependent on the approval by the 
board of such progressive and comprehensive schemes of education 
in a local area. The act abolishes the fee, the aid, and the small 
population grants, and provides that the consolidated grant shall be 
not less than one-half of the expenditure of a local authority. By 
this means the board will have the power of requiring, among other 
1¥or a detailed statement see Kandel, I. L, Elementary Education in England, U, S. 
Bureau of Education, Bulletin, 1913, No. 57.

EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 85 
things, the efficient administration of school attendance, the satisfac- 
tory provision of elementary continuation and secondary schools, the 
maintenance of adequate and suitable teaching staffs, and the pro- 
vision of adequate systems of medical inspection and treatment. 
For the first time in the history of English education the national 
authorities are placed by the act in a position to secure full informa- 
tion as to the provision of education throughout the country, the re- 
sponsibility of furnishing such information being placed upon the 
schools. Under other provisions the board is empowered on request, 
to inspect schools not already on its grant list and with local educa- 
tion authorities to inspect schools that desire to qualify as efficient for 
the purposes of securing exemptions from attendance at public ele- 
mentary or continuation schools. The effect of these measures, com- 
bined with the indirect influence of the qualifications required of 
teachers for registration with the Teachers’ Registration Council, 
will have an incalculable effect in raising the standards of private 
schools, and at the same time safeguarding their status. Room will 
thus be found under the national system for public and private 
schools, schools established and maintained entirely by the public 
authorities, and nonprovided schools, or those established by denomi- 
national bodies but maintained out of public funds. Such a scheme 
under the wise direction and advice of the Board of Education will 
secure that variety and initiative on which the English system is 
founded, while the new method of allocating grants will furnish the 
necessary encouragement for the rapid expansion of the system. It 
is significant that for the first time in English history the act speaks 
of the development of a national system of public education. By 
bringing the private schools into more effective relations with public 
education England will present an example of a national system in 
which public and private effort cooperate to the larger end. 
The responsibility for “the progressive development and compre- 
hensive organization of edudation ” is intrusted to the county authori- 
ties in all matters pertaining to elementary, secondary, and higher 
education. The noncounty boroughs and the urban districts have 
the same responsibility only in relation to elementary education, 
which is now considerably expanded in conception. Provision is 
made, however, for cooperation between the two types of authorities, 
and also for the federation of any two educational areas for coopera- 
tive purposes under joint bodies of managers, including teachers and 
representatives of universities. Under the extended powers of the 
act, education authorities now become the responsible authorities for 
the administration of the Employment of Children Act, 1903, the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904, and the Children Act, 
1908. Further, for the promotion of physical and social training, 
education authorities may maintain and equip holiday camps, centers
-P-A-G-E-86
86 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
for recreation and physical training, playing fields, school baths, 
and swimming baths and other facilities in addition to the system 
of medical inspection and treatment. Finally, the limit hitherto im- 
posed on the amount that could be raised by county authorities for 
secondary and higher education is removed. The duty is imposed 
on local education authorities to draft schemes for their areas after 
due consideration of existing facilities, public or private, and of the 
possible advantages of cooperation. Since the new system of grants 
will be based on the adequacy of a scheme as a whole, it will effectu- 
ally check the development of schemes that are not comprehensive. 
Here again the Board of Education will act in an advisory capacity, 
and the responsibility for the development of local initiative and 
progress is placed on the local education authorities and so on the 
public in whose interests schools are maintained. The withholding 
-of grants and the power of the board to conduct public inquiries, the 
reports of which may be laid before Parliament, are effective meas- 
ures for dealing with recalcitrant authorities. 
While the improvement of the administrative organization of edu- 
cation constitutes one of the purposes of the act, it is not in any way 
its main purpose. Primarily, the act represents the new democracy 
rising to a recognition of the function of education in preparing 
healthy, intelligent, and responsible citizens. The advancement of 
the physical welfare of the nation, with the promotion of educational 
opportunities, constitutes the chief objects of the act. As at the time 
of the South African War, so at this crisis, recruiting of soldiers has 
revealed the great extent of physical deficiencies in the country; at 
the same time a, better chance for survival is to be furnished to every 
child in order to repair the physical wastage of the war. An already 
excellent system of school medical inspection and a developing sys- 
tem of medical treatment are extended by the act. In the schools 
for mothers training is given in prenatal care and the care of infant 
children. From the age of 2 to 5 or 6, children may attend nursery 
schools where attention will be devoted primarily to their “health, 
nourishment, and physical welfare.” In the elementary schools the 
existing regulations for school medical inspection and treatment will 
apply, with the probability that more effective provision of the latter 
will be required under the procedure by schemes. By the provisions 
of the new act, local education authorities are empowered to extend 
this system of medical inspection and treatment to pupils in secondary 
and continuation schools maintained by them, and even in schools 
not aided by them, if so requested. Since the National Insurance Act 
applies to employed persons from the age of 16 up, the great ma- 
jority of citizens in England and Wales will be under an effective 
system of medical supervision throughout their lives. At the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 87 
time local authorities:are‘required to ascertain the number of physi- 
cally defective and epileptic children and make such provision. for 
their education as they are already required to make for mental de- 
fectives under the Elementary Education (Defective and Epileptic 
Children) Acts, 1899 to 1914. 
These measures for the prevention and cure of disease are sup- 
plemented by positive measures for the promotion of health through 
physical training, which is to form an even more important part of 
the curriculum of elementary, continuation, and secondary. schools 
than ever before. The power granted to authorities to supply or 
maintain holiday or school camps, centers and equipment for physi- 
cal training, playing fields, school baths, school swimming baths, and 
“other facilities for social and physical training in the day or even- 
ing” has already been referred to. Before the passing of the act the 
Government had already inaugurated the practice of financially 
assisting local authorities in the appointment of play supervisors 
and in the maintenance of evening recreation centers. By these 
measures provision is made for social and moral training as well as 
physical. Mr. Fisher allayed the fear that an. opportunity would be 
seized to expand physical training to cover military training. He 
agreed that— 
it would be entirely inappropriate to take advantage of an. education bill 
to introduce’such a very radical‘alteration in our scheme of education as the 
introduction of compulsory military training in schools. So.far as he knew 
their mind, the war office had no desire whatever to see, military training in 
the continuation schools given to young people in this country. The interest 
of the war office was that young boys, when they reached the military age of 
18, should ‘be ‘in fit physical condition. It was only after they had reached 
18 that formal instruction under the war office: began. 7. 
The control of child labor, which constitutes the greatest menace 
to physical welfare, is now placed in the hands of the education 
authorities. No child of school age will be permitted to be émployed 
on any school day or on any day before 6 o’clock in the morning or 
after 8 o’clock in the evening or for more than two hours oh Sundiy. 
By an unfortunate concession, local authorities may by by- -laws per- 
mit the employment of children over 12 for one hour before’ and 
‘one hour after school. Street trading by children is prohibited, and 
Yesttictions are placed around the employment. of children on the 
‘stage and in certain factories and occupations. On the report of 
a school medical officer individual children may be prohibited from 
engaging in certain occupations that may be prejudicial to health or 
physical development or interfere with their obtaining the proper 
‘benefit from education. 
In the matter of school attendance, the act at one stroke removes 
all exemptions from attendance at public elementary schools, in
-P-A-G-E-88
88 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
which fees are now entirely abolished, for children between the 
ages of 5 and 14, unless exemption is claimed on the ground of attend- 
ance at other schools that must be subject to inspection either by a 
local authority or the Board of Education. Thus is brought to a 
close controversy that has lasted nearly 30 years on the ‘question of 
half-time attendance at school for children over 11 or 12 years of 
age. Where nursery schools are established, a local authority may 
permit attendance at these up to the age of 6 and transfer to the 
elementary schools at that age. Further, local authorities are em- 
powered to enact ‘by-laws: requiring compulsory attendance at pub- 
lic elementary schools up to the age of 15, or, with the approval of 
the board, up to 16. 
The act now extends the scope of the elementary schools by re- 
quiring the inclusion of practical instruction suitable to the ages, 
abilities, and requirements of the children and the organization of 
advanced instruction for the older or more intelligent children, who 
are not transferred to higher schools, by means of central schools 
and central or special classes. This provision means that children 
in the upper grades will not be required to waste what for many 
will be the last years of full-time education as the result of an anti- 
quated definition of the term “elementary school.” The act thus 
sets up what will virtually prove to be a system of intermediate edu- 
eation, with the right to exemption from attendance at continuation 
schools for children remaining until 16. The act does not define, 
nor did the debates bring out, the nature of the work that will be 
provided in the advanced courses, but the guess may be hazarded 
that they will follow the type already successfully inaugurated in 
the London central schools, and probably not unlike some of the 
schemes proposed for the junior high schools in this country. 
For the present the question of providing free secondary schools 
is shelved, but local authorities are encouraged to provide a more 
adequate supply of secondary schools, with easier access to them, so 
that, in the words of the act, “children and young persons shall not 
be debarred from receiving the benefits of any form of education by 
which they are capable of profiting through inability to pay fees.” 
The enlarged and enriched opportunities of education will consist 
not merely of an increase of free places to pupils from elementary 
schools and of scholarships, but also of the provision of maintenance 
allowances. Beyond the references already made the act does not 
deal with secondary schools, but the board has recently issued new 
regulations that will require the organization of advanced courses 
for pupils above the age of 16 who desire to specialize in classics, 
science, and mathematics, and modern languages. Up to the age of 
16 it is intended that all pupils shall enjoy a general education with

EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 89 
due recognition of the claims of the classics, the sciences, and modern ~ 
languages in a liberal education. Vocational preparation finds no 
place in the program, but will probably be provided in an extension 
of the number of junior and senior technical schools. 
Up to this point Mr. Fisher encountered no difficulty in iit 
his measure through the House of Commons. The storm center 
proved to be the provision for compulsory attendance at continuation 
schools for young persons between the ages of 14 and 18 for 8 hours 
a week for 40 weeks in the year between the hours of 7 in the morn- 
ing and 8 in the evening. Employers are required not only to allow 
the time off necessary for attending school, but such additional time 
up to two hours as may be necessary to secure that a young person 
“is in a fit mental and bodily condition to receive full benefit from 
the attendance at school.” The young person, his parents, and his 
employers may be liable to a fine if he fail to attend regularly. Ex- 
emptions from attendance are granted only to those who have at- 
tended a full-time day school to 16 or are in attendance at such school 
or are attending part-time continuation or “works” schools estab- 
lished by employers in connection with their factories and open to 
inspection by the board and the local education authority. 
The chief opposition came from a small group of employers who 
feared that their supply of labor would be cut off. These were ready 
to suggest all kinds of compromises—half-time attendance for 20 
hours a week between the ages of 14 and 16; special intensified and 
advanced courses for pupils between 12 and 14; and increased oppor- 
tunities for secondary and university education for brighter pupils. 
But, as Mr. Visher eloquently pointed out, “there is nothing sacro- 
sanct itself about industry. The real interests of the State do not 
consist in the maintenance of this or that industry, but in the main- 
tenance of the welfare of all its citizens.” 
To the surprise of the opposition, no less than of his supporters, ° 
Mr. Fisher agreed to postpone the full operation of the compulsory 
provision as it affects young persons between 16 and 18 for seven 
years from the appointed day, that is, the day on which the whole 
section is declared by the board to become operative. In addition he 
agreed to reduce the required attendance from 8 hours a week to 
7 hours. The opposition was now satisfied, but many of the 
ardent supporters of the bill charged Mr. Fisher with betraying the 
cause. As a matter of fact Mr. Fisher has sacrificed nothing that he 
was not fully aware could be sacrificed. It is obvious that at this 
crisis, when the building of new schools is suspended, when the ex- 
isting schools have the greatest. difficulty in maintaining even a mini- 
mum supply of teachers, and when the industrial demands for labor 
are urgent, the full operation of the law would not have been pos-
-P-A-G-E-90
90 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
sible. Mr. Fisher’s compromise means that a start can soon be made 
and that the public will be educated to the full significance of the 
measure when the seven years: are completed. A number of educa- 
tional authorities and a number of the larger industrial establishments 
have already adopted schemes that have the approval of the board, 
thus disproving the contention that only the bare minimum required 
by Mr. Fisher’s concession will be provided. The probability is that 
after seven years of experimentation local authorities will be ready 
to'do more than the act requires. 
As in the case of the advanced courses in elementary schools, the 
function of the continuation schools is broadly defined as schools “in 
which suitable courses of study, instruction, and physical training are 
provided without payment of fees.” The provisions for social train- 
ing and medical inspection will also apply to these schools. It is 
probable that the courses of study will be liberal and general in 
character. Indeed, guaranties were asked and assurances were given 
in the course of the debates that specific vocational training would 
not be given in these schools, but as Mr. Fisher pointed out: 
It would not be to the interest of an educated democracy that there should 
be no connection between the education they were seeking in the schools and the 
lives they were to lead. At the same time he felt that education should be a 
great liberating force, that it should provide compensation against the sordid 
monotony which attached to so much of industrial life of the country by 
lifting the workers to a more elevated and pure atmosphere, and the board 
would be false to the purpose for which the bill was framed if it were to 
sanction a system in continuation schools in which due attention was not 
paid to the liberal aspects of education. 
The attitude of the Workers’ Education Association was some- 
what the same in their declaration of a policy— 
That the education in such schools should be directed solely toward the full 
_ development of the bodies, minds, and character of the pupils; that it should 
therefore be intimately related to the environment and interests of the pupils 
and should contain ample provision for physical well-being, 
Under the freedom permitted by the’ procedure through’ schemes, 
considerable latitude will be permitted to local authorities to adapt 
the courses to local conditions. The vocations will no doubt furnish 
a starting point for such courses of instruction. The Report of the 
Departmental Committee on Juvenile Education * contains some sug- 
gestions on the organization of the curriculum of continuation 
schools. Instruction should in no case be too narrowly technical, 
and the curriculum should maintain a proper balance between the 
technical and humanistic elements, since the primary function of 
education is to prepare for citizenship. A’ four-year course should be 
divided into equal stages, of which the first will be mainly’ general,   
4 See pp. 22m.
-P-A-G-E-91
t 3 3 BAT ST ae 
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 91 
and the second technical and vocational. The common ground for 
all in the first stage should be English subjects, including not only 
literature but geography and social and industrial history. The 
remaining subjects should be mathematics, manual training, science, 
each varied to suit the needs and ‘the occupational interests of the 
students, and physical training. Only in the second stage would the 
curriculum be definitely founded on the chief vocational groups— 
agriculture, engineering, building, mining, textiles, the technical in- 
dustries, commercial occupations, and domestic occupations. But even 
in the second stage the committee urges that technical subjects might 
be included as a medium of education and not asa means of produc- 
tion. In general the emphasis should be placed on social, historical, 
and economic elements in the subjects adopted in both stages. Steps 
have already been taken, as, for example, at the University of Man- 
chester, to furnish special courses for training teachers for continua- 
tion schools. For the present there is some danger that a false start 
may be made by appointing teachers whose sole experience has been 
in elementary or secondary schools. However that may be, the point 
that needs to be emphasized here is that the criticism that has been 
leveled against Mr. Fisher’s compromise is not valid, and that the 
continuation school with compulsory attendance required up to the 
age of 18 will be an accomplished fact at the close of the seven years 
of the postponement. It is significant that this is the only point that 
has been subjected to serious criticism. 
The true estimate of the act may be reached by comparing it with 
the suggestions and recommendations of the bodies referred to on 
pp. 70ff; those which have not been incorporated in the act can be pro- 
vided for by the Board ‘of Education by its administrative regula- 
tions; others look too far into the future. It must be borne in mind 
that the act is but a first step, giving local authorities power to expand 
their educational activities. However desirable such proposals may 
be, the time is not ripe for the abolition of fees in secondary schools 
and for establishing an. entirely free system of higher education or 
for the payment by the State of grants equal to 75 per cent of the local 
expenditure on education or to require 20 hours’ attendance a week 
at continuation schools. Other suggestions will probably never be 
adopted in England; it is unlikely, for example, that the State will 
assume the direct payment of teachers’ salaries, and, as a consequence, 
the establishment of the teaching profession as a branch of the civil 
service; it is improbable too that teachers will be placed on education 
committees to any large extent, especially as joint councils may be 
set up under the Whitley committee’s recommendations. Technical 
education, university education, adult education, and the training 
of teachers still remain problems that the Government must shortly  
-P-A-G-E-92
  92 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
consider, but, important though they are, these problems are not such 
as could be legislated upon at the present crisis. 
The act has been variously hailed as the children’s charter and as 
the Nation’s charter. Certainly it inaugurates a new era as embody- 
ing “ the first real attempt ever made in this country (England) to 
lay broad and deep the foundations of a scheme of education which 
would be truly national.” Of much greater significance for the future 
of English democracy is the fact that the act is an attempt to provide 
the foundations of an education for the great mass of young citizens 
which, to quote Mr. Fisher, is “ adequate to the new, serious, and en- 
during liabilities which the development of this great world war cre- 
ates for our Empire or to the new civic burdens which we are imposing 
upon millions of our people.” But whatever the merits of the act may 
be, it should not escape attention that the English Government and 
the English people did not consider it incompatible with the successful 
conduct of the war to divert some attention to the more pressing do- 
mestic problems of the present and the immediate future. Education 
is but part of the broader program for reconstruction after the war 
that is already being considered in England and whose scope is defined 
in the following words by the war cabinet in its report for 1917: 
It is, indeed, becoming more and more apparent that reconstruction is not so 
much a question of rebuilding society as it was before the war, but of molding a 
better world out of the social and economic conditions which have come into 
being during the war.

Be it enacted by the King’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present 
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 
National System of Public Education. 
1, With a view to the establishment of a national system of public education 
available for all persons capable of profiting thereby, it shall be the duty of the 
council of every county and county borough, so far as their powers extend, to 
contribute thereto by providing for the progressive development and com- 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
  
  94 BIENNIAL SURVEY, OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
prehensive organization of education in respect of their area, and with that 
object any such council from time to time may, and shall when required by the 
Board of Education, submit to the board schemes showing the mode in which 
their duties and powers under the education acts are to be performed and 
exercised, whether separately or in cooperation with other authorities. 
2. (1) It shall be the duty of a local education authority so to exercise their 
powers‘under Part III of the Education Act, 1902, as— 
(a) To make, or otherwise to secure, adequate and suitable provision by 
means of central schools, central or special classes, or otherwise— 
(i) For including in the curriculum of public elementary schools, 
at appropriate stages, practical instruction suitable to the ages, abili- 
ties, and requirements of the children; and 
(ii) For organizing in public elementary schools courses of ad- 
vanced instruction for the older or more intelligent children in at- 
tendance at such schools, including children who stay at such schools 
beyond the age of 14; 
(db) "To make, or otherwise to. secure, adequate and suitable arrangements 
under the provisions of paragraph (6) of subsection. (1) of section 13 
of the Education (Administrative Provisions) Act, 1907, for attending 
to the health and physical condition of children educated in _ public 
elementary ‘schools ; and 
(c) To make, or otherwise to secure, adequate and suitable arrangements: 
for cooperating with local education authorities for. the purposes of 
Part II of the Education Act, 1902, in matters of common interest, and. 
particularly in respect of— 
(i) "The preparation of children for further education in schools 
other than elementary, and their transference at suitable ages to 
such schools; and 
(ii) The supply and training of teachers; 
and any such authority from time to time may, and shall when required by the 
Board of Education, submit to the board schemes for the exercise of their 
powers as an authority for the purposes of Part III of the Hducation Act, 1902. 
(2) So much of the definition of the term “elementary school” in section 
three of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, as requires that elementary edu- 
cation shall be the principal part of the education there given, shall not apply 
to such courses of advanced instruction as aforesaid, 
8. (1) Itshall be the duty of the local education authority for the purposes 
of Part II of the Education Act, 1902, either separately or in cooperation with 
other local education. authorities, to establish and maintain, or secure the 
establishment and maintenance under their control and direction, of a sufficient 
supply of continuation schools in which suitable courses of study, instruction, 
and physical training are provided without payment of fees for all young per- 
sons ‘resident in their area who are, under this act, under an obligation to at- 
tend such schools. 
(2) For the purposes aforesaid the local education authority from time to 
time may, and shall when required by the Board of Education, submit to the 
board schemes for the progressive organization of a system of continuation 
schools, and for securing general and regular attendance thereat, and in pre- 
paring schemes under this section the local education authority shall have 
regard to the desirability of including therein arrangements for cooperation 
with universities in the provision of lectures and classes for scholars for moe 
instruction by such means is suitable. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 95 
(3) The council of any county shall, if practicable, provide for the in- 
clusion of representatives of education authorities for the purposes of Part III 
of the Education Act, 1902, in any body of managers of continuation schools 
within the area of those authorities. 
4, (1) The council of any county, before submitting a scheme under this 
act, shall consult the other authorities within their county (if any) who are 
authorities for the purposes of Part III of the Education Act, 1902, with refer- 
ence to the mode in which and the extent to which any such authority will 
cooperate with the council in carrying out their scheme, and when submitting 
their. scheme shall make a report to the Board of Education as to the co- 
operation which is to be anticipated from any such authority, and any such 
authority may, if they so desire, submit to the board as well as to the council 
of the county any proposals or representations relating to the provision or or- 
ganization of education in the area of that authority for consideration in con- 
nection with the scheme of the county. 
(2) Before submitting schemes under this act a local education authority 
shall consider any representations made to them by parents or other persons 
or bodies of persons interested, and shall adopt such measures to ascertain 
their views.as they consider desirable, and the authority shall take such steps 
to give publicity to their proposals as they consider suitable, or as the Board 
of Education may require. 3 
(3) A local education authority in preparing schemes under this act shall 
have regard to any existing supply of efficient and suitable schools or colleges 
not provided by local education authorities, and to any proposals to provide 
such, schools or colleges. 
(4) In schemes under this act adequate provision shall be made in order to 
secure that children and young persons shall not be debarred from receiving 
the benefits of any form of education by which they are capable of profiting 
through inability to pay fees. 
5. (1) The Board of Education may approve any scheme (which term shall 
include an interim, provisional, or amending scheme) submitted to them under 
this act by a local education authority, and thereupon it shall be the duty 
of the local education authority to give effect to the scheme. 
(2) If the Board of Education are of opinion that a scheme does not make 
adequate provision in respect of all or any of the purposes to which the scheme 
relates, and the board are unable to agree with the authority as to what 
amendments should be made in the scheme, they shall offer to hold a confer- 
ence with the representatives of the authority and, if requested by the au- 
thority, shall hold a public inquiry in the matter. 
(3) If thereafter the Board of Education disapprove a scheme, they shall 
notify the authority, and, if within one month after such notification an agree- 
ment is not reached, they shall lay before Parliament the report of the public 
inquiry (if any) together with a report stating their reasons for such disap- 
proval and any action which they intend to take in consequenc? thereof by 
way of withholding or reducing any grants payable to the authority. 
6. (1) For the purpose of performing any duty or exercising any power 
under the education acts, a council having powers under those acts may enter 
into such arrangements as they think proper for cooperation or combination 
with any other council or councils having such powers, and any such arrange- 
ment may provide for the appointment of a joint committee or a joint body of 
managers, for the delegation to that committee or body of managers of any 
powers or duties of the councils (other than the power of raising a rate or 
borrowing money), for the proportion of contributions to be paid by each coun-
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
cil, and for any other matters which appear necessary for carrying out the 
arrangement. 
(2) The Board of Education may, on the application of two or more councils 
having powers under the education acts, by scheme provide for the éstablish- 
ment and (if thought fit) the incorporation of a federation for such purposes 
of any such arrangements as aforesaid as may be specified in the scheme as 
being purposes relating to matters of common interest concerning education 
which it is necessary or convenient to consider in relation to areas larger than 
those of individual education authorities, and the powers conferred on councils 
by this section shall include power to arrange for the performance of any 
educational or administrative functions by such a federation as if it were a 
joint committee or a joint body of managers: Provided, That no council shall 
without its consent be included in a scheme establishing a federation, and no 
council shall be obliged to continue in a federation except in accordance with 
the provisions of a scheme to which it has consented. 
(3) A scheme made by the Board of Education constituting a federation, 
and an arrangement establishing a joint committee or a joint body of managers, 
shall provide for the appointment of at least two-thirds of the members by 
councils having powers under the education acts, and may provide either 
directly or by cooperation for the inclusion of teachers or other ‘persons of 
experience in education and of representatives of universities or other bodies. 
(4) A scheme constituting a federation may on the application of one or 
more of the councils concerned be modified or repealed by a further scheme, 
and, where a scheme provides for the discontinuance of a federation, provision 
may be made for dealing with any property or liabilities of the federation. 
(5) Where any arrangement under this section provides for the payment of 
an annual contribution by one council to another, the contribution shall, for 
the purposes of section 19 of the Education Act, 1902, form part of the security 
on which money may be borrowed under that section. 
7. The limit under section 2 of the Education Act, 1902, on the amount to 
be raised by the council of a county out of rates for the purpose of education 
other than elementary shall cease to have effect. 
Attendance at School and Employment of Children and Young Persons. 
8. (1) Subject as provided in this act, no exemption from attendance at 
school shall be granted to any child between the ages of 5 and 14 years, and 
any enactment giving a power, or imposing a duty, to provide for any such 
exemption, and any provision of a by-law providing for any such exemption, 
shall cease to have effect, without prejudice to any exemptions already granted. 
Any by-law which names a lower age than 14 as the age up to which a parent 
shall cause his child to attend school shall have effect as if the age of 14 were 
substituted for that lower age. 
(2) In section 74 of the Elementary Education Act, 1870, as amended by 
section 6 of the Elementary Education Act, 1900, 15 years shall be substituted 
for 14 years as the maximum age up to which by-laws relating to school 
attendance may require parents to cause their children to attend school, and 
any such by-law requiring attendance at school of children between the ages 
of 14 and 15 may apply either generally to all such children, or to children 
_other than those employed in any specified occupations: Provided, That it shall 
be lawful for a local education authority to grant exemption from the obligation 
to attend school to individual children between the ages of 14 and 15 for such 
time and upon such conditions as the authority think fit in any case where after 
due inquiry the circumstances seem to justify such an exemption,
-P-A-G-E-97
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 97 
(3) It shall not ‘be a defense to proceedings relating to school attendance 
under the education acts or any by-laws made thereunder that a child is 
attending a school or institution providing efficient elementary instruction unless 
the school or institution is open to inspection either by the local education 
authority or by the Board of Education, and unless satisfactory registers are 
kept of the attendance of the scholars thereat. 
(4) A local education authority may with the approval of the Board of 
Education make a by-law under section 74 of the Elementary Education Act, 
1870, providing that parents shall not be required to cause their children to 
attend school or to receive efficient elementary instruction in reading, writing, 
~ and arithmetic before the age of 6 years: Provided, That in considering any such 
by-law the board shall have regard to the adequacy of the provision of nursery 
schools for the area to which the by-law relates, and shall, if requested by any 
10 parents of children attending public elementary schools for that area, hold a 
public inquiry for the purpose of determining whether the by-law should be 
approved. 
(5) Notwithstanding anything in the education acts the Board of Education 
may, on the application of the local education authority, authorize the instruc- 
tion of children in public elementary schools till the end of the school term 
in which they reach the age of 16 or (in special circumstances) such later 
age as appears to the board desirable: Provided, That, in considering such appli- 
cation, the board shall have regard to the adequacy of the provision of nursery 
schools for the area to which under paragraphs (a) and (¢) of subsection 
(1) of section 2 of this act and to the effective development and organization of 
all forms of education in the area, and to any representations made by the mana- 
gers of schools. : 
(6) The power of a local education authority under section 7 of the Educa- 
tion Act, 1902, to give directions as to secular instruction shall include the power 
to direct that any child in attendance at a public elementary school shall attend 
during such hours as may be directed by the authority at any class, whether 
conducted on the school premises or not, for the purpose of practical or special 
instruction or demonstration, and attendance at such a class shall, where the 
local education authority so direct, be deemed for the purpose of any enact- 
ment or by-law relating to school attendance to be attendance at a public 
elementary school: Provided, That, if by reason of any such direction a child is 
prevented on any day from receiving religious instruction in the school at the | 
ordinary time mentioned in the time-table, reasonable facilities shall be afforded, 
subject to the provisions of section 7 of the Hlementary Education Act, 1870, for 
enabling such child to receive religious instruction in the school at some other 
time. 
(7) In section 11 of the Elementary Education Act, 1876 (which relates to 
school attendance). for the words “there is not within 2 miles” there shall be 
substituted the words “there is not within such distance as may be prescribed 
by the bylaws.” 
- (8) Nothing in this section shall affect the provisions of the Elementary 
Education (Blind and Deaf Children) Act, 1893. or the Elementary Education 
(Defective and Epileptic Children) Acts. 1899 to 1914, relating to the attendance 
at school of the children to whom those acts apply. 
9, (1) If a child who is attending or is about to attend a public elementary 
school or a school certified by the Board of Education under the Elementary 
Edueation (Blind and Deaf Children) Act, 1893, or the Elementary Education

and bodily condition to receive full benefit from attendance at the school: Pro- 
vided, That if any question arises between the local education authority and the 
employer of a young person whether a requirement made under this subsection 
is reasonable for the purposes aforesaid, that question shall be determined by 
the Board of Education, and if the Board of Education determine that the 
requirement is unreasonable, they may substitute such other requirement as 
they think reasonable. 
(7) The local education authority shall not require any young person to 
attend a continuation school on a Sunday, or on any day or part of a day exclu- 
sively set apart for religious observance by the religious body to which he

enjoy, nor between the hours of 7 in the evening and 8 in the morning:

board, vary those hours in the case of young persons employed at night or other- 
wise employed at abnormal times.

under the age of 16 represents in writing to the local education authority that 
he objects to any part of the instruction given in the continuation school which 
the young person is required to attend, on the ground that it is contrary or 
offensive to his religious belief, the obligation under this act to attend that 
school for the purpose of such instruction shall not apply to him, and the local 
education authority shali, if practicable, arrange for him to attend some other 
instruction in lieu thereof or some other school.

be substituted— 
(a) A yearly sum equal to a percentage not exceeding 224 per cent fixed 
from time to time at a uniform rate for every county by the Central

subsection (3) of section 8 of the Welsh Intermediate Education Act, 
1889; and 
(b) A yearly sum equal to 5 per cent of the net income for the preceding year

  110 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
(2) Subject to the regulations made under the next succeeding subsection, 
the total sums paid to a local education authority out of moneys provided by 
Parliament and the total taxation account in aid of elementary education or 
education other than elementary, as the case may be, shall not be less than 
one-half of the net expenditure of the authority recognized by the Board of 
Education as expenditure in aid of which parliamentary grants should be 
made to the authority, and, if the total sums payable out of those moneys to 
an authority in any year fall short of one-half of that expenditure, there shall 
be paid by the Board of Education to that authority, out of moneys provided 
by Parliament, a deficiency grant equal to the amount of the deficiency, provided 
that a deficiency grant shall not be so paid as to make good to the authority 
any deductions made from a substantive grant. 
(3) The Board of Education may make regulations for the purpose of 
determining how the amount of any deficiency grant payable under this section 
shall be ascertained and paid, and those regulations, shall if the Treasury so 
direct, provide for the exclusion in the ascertainment of that amount of all or 
any sums paid by any Government department other than the Board of Educa- 
tion and of all or any expenditure which in the opinion of the Board of Educa- 
tion is attributable to a service in respect of which payments are made by a 
Government department other than the Board of Education. 
* * * * * * * 
(5) If, by reason of the failure of an authority to perform its duties under 
the education acts or to comply with the conditions on which grants are made, 
the deficiency grant is reduced or a deduction is made from any substantive 
grant exceeding £500 or the amount which would be produced by a rate of a 
halfpenny in the pound whichever is the less, the Board of Education shall 
cause to be laid before Parliament a report stating the amount of and the 
reasons for the reduction or deduction. 
(6) Any regulations made by the Board of Education for the payment 
of grants shall be laid before Parliament as soon as may be after they are 
made.

trust property upon the trusts and for the purposes for which they were held 
by the official trustee of charity lands and the official trustees of charitable 
funds, and, on such a certificate by the official trustees of charitable funds as 
aforesaid being sent to the person having charge of the books or registers in

which any such securities are inscribed or registered, that person shall make 
such entries in the books or registers as may be necessary to give effect to 
this section. 
(8) If any question arises as to whether an endowment or any part of an 
endowment is held for or ought to be applied to solely educational purposes, 
the question shall be determined by the Charity Commissioners. 
* * * * * * * 
(3) Every assurance of land or personal estate to be laid out in the purchase 
of land for educational purposes, including every assurance of land to any local 
authority for any educational purpose or purposes for which such authority is 
empowered by any act of Parliament to acquire land, shall be sent to the 
offices of the Board of Education in London for the purpose of being recorded 
in the books of the board as soon as may be after the execution of the deed or 
other instrument of assurance, or in the case of a will after the death of the 
testator. 
47. Where, under any scheme made before the passing of this act relating to 
an educational charity, the approval of the Board of Education is required to the 
exercise by the trustees under the scheme of a power of appointing new 
trustees, the scheme shall, except in such cases as the board may otherwise

SCOTLAND. 
THE SCHOOLS DURING THE WAR. 
Education in Scotland passed through the same vicissitudes since 
the outbreak of the war as in England. The Scotch Department of 
Education, local school board managers, and teachers devoted much 
energy to minimizing the interference with education created by the 
new conditions, but the inevitable dislocation occurred. Many of 
the school buildings during the past two years continued to be under 
military occupation. This led to the introduction in many places of 
“double shifts,” which, however, did not prove to be a satisfactory 
experiment educationally. The worst feature was a continuance of 
irregular attendance and of the granting of exemptions, especially 
in rural agricultural areas. The number of school boards granting 
no exemptions was 320 in 1913-14; 263 in 1914-15; 126 in 1915-16; 
and 112 in 1916-17. 
The relaxation of discipline resulted in an increase of juvenile 
delinquency, which attracted the attention of all interested in the 
training of the young. Even allowing for the fact that many of 
the offenses which are statistically set down as crimes are only 
“childish pranks” or the “assertion of independence of control,” 
the problem became serious. Here, as elsewhere, the establishment
-P-A-G-E-113
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 1138 
of play centers, supported by Government grants, provided a means 
for redirecting the youthful energies into right channels. Other 
agencies such as scouts, brigades and clubs, employment agencies 
maintained by school boards, played their part in this crisis. 
The greater prosperity of the country conduced to an improve- 
ment in the general welfare of the children, a fortunate circumstance 
in view of the difficulties involved in maintaining the school medical 
service on a normal basis. While there was a considerable decrease 
in the number of children medically inspected, there was an appre- 
ciable increase in the provision and expenditure for medical treat- 
ment. 
The depletion in the number of available teachers was met by an _ 
increase in the size of classes, “by the continuance of teachers who 
had reached the age for retirement, by the temporary return of 
women teachers who had given up teaching on their marriage, and 
by the employment of a limited number of persons of good education 
likely to be of use in schools for which no technically qualified teacher 
was available.” The output of the teachers’ training colleges also 
appears to have been satisfactory. When the question of salaries 
became urgent, the Treasury agreed in 1916-17 “to allow a grant 
of one-half of the bonus paid by the managers, subject to a maximum 
grant of £5 in the case of teachers in receipt of salaries not exceed- 
ing £110 or of £4 in the case of teachers whose salaries exceeded 
£110 but did not exceed £160.” The total grant paid in this way 
amounted to $164,955. In the following year an additional grant of 
$2,649,280 for education was made to Scotland, of which $1,970,875 
was devoted to the purpose of securing definite increases of salary to 
replace the bonus. With the amount added by school boards there 
accrued to teachers an average increase of $90. For the year 1918-19 
an additional appropriation was made by Parliament of $2,000,000 
for the improvement of teachers’ salaries and pensions. In July, 
1917, the department appointed a committee on the remuneration of 
teachers in Scotland, which issued a report later in the same year 
embodying proposed scales of salaries for teachers and other recom- 
mendations. (See pp. 112f.) The department also devoted part of 
the new grant to increasing the pensions of retired teachers to a 
minimum of $260 a year. 
Intermediate and secondary education showed increasing enroll- 
ment and increasing attendance. In 1914-15 the number of pupils in 
higher grade or intermediate schools was 29,488; in 1915-16, 30,699; 
and in 1916-17, 31,949. In the grant-earning secondary schools the 
enrollment in 1915 was 19,866; in 1915-16, 20,317; and in 1916-17, 
21,012. Continuation classes and central institutions for technical 
instruction, both of which are normally attended by older pupils than 
the full-time intermediate and secondary schools, were adversely

-P-A-G-E-114
114 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
affected by the war and showed considerable decrease in enrollment 
and attendance. The central institutions, however, directed their at- 
tention and resources to war work and also undertook the training of 
disabled soldiers and sailors in cooperation with local pension com- 
mittees. 
The total net ordinary expenditure of the school boards for 1914-15 
was $20,388,780 and the income $20,853,725, of which $9,387,005 
came from the department. In 1915-16 all these items indicate an 
increase; the expenditure was $20,534,460, the income $21,098,730, 
and the department grant was $9,454,905, a sum which was consid- 
erably increased in the following year by the extraordinary grant for 
. the increase of salaries, © 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES.* 
The effect of the war on salaries of teachers in Scotland was similar 
to that in England and Wales, with similar attempts to meet the 
situation by the grant of bonuses. In July, 1917, the Government 
appointed a departmental committee on the remuneration of teachers 
in Scotland? which considered and reported in November, 1917, on 
salaries in elementary and secondary schools, and in training colleges. 
The general considerations determining the report of the committee 
were as follows: 
In considering the larger and more important part of our reference, viz, the 
suitable scales of salary for different classes of teachers, we desired to approach 
the question not solely, nor even mainly, as one involving the interests of a 
single profession, but as one vitally affecting the welfare of the whole com- 
munity. That welfare must depend, in increasing measure, upon the efficiency 
of national education; and the fundamental requirement for securing this is 
that there should be an adequate supply of teachers of high capacity, proved 
aptitude, and thorough training. This can not be attained unless the remunera- 
tion is such as to make the teaching profession one which may compete with 
other professions in securing recruits of sufficient capacity, and in repaying these 
recruits for the time and labor spent in their special training. To attract such 
recruits it is necessary not only that a fair salary should be offered to begin 
with, but—and it is an even more vital condition—that sufficiently attractive 
prospects should be opened to those who have served for a certain number of 
years. : 
Following this line of inquiry the committee came to the following 
general conclusions: ; 
1. That not only as a temporary war measure, but as a permanent necessity, 
in order to maintain an efficient teaching profession in the interests of the coun- 
try, the general remuneration of teachers must be raised, and that an equaliza- 
tion of the scale of salaries for similar classes of schools over the country is 
desirable,

Report of a Departmental Committee on the Remuneration of Teachers in Scotland, 
Edinburgh, 1917, 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 115 
2. That this can not be attained by any continuation of or extension of the 
bonus system. 
3. That, while an adequate initial salary must be provided, it is even of greater 
importance that improved prospects should be opened to those who attain a cer- 
tain length of service, and have proved their competency and their aptitude for 
the profession. 
4. That the scale should take account of— 
(a) The length and character of the preliminary training. 
(b) Length of service. 
(c) The responsibility of the post held and its demands on the capacity 
and energy of a teacher. 
The scales recommended by the committee are in every case higher 
than those prevailing at present and determined by local and acci- 
dental circumstances. While aware of the large increase of expendi- 
ture involved, the committee declares it to be its— 
firm and considered conviction, however, that the scheme * * * can not be 
attained except, first, by an extension of school areas; and, secondly, by a very 
large proportion of the additional amount required being provided by the 
central authority. * * * Whatever the cost, if it is proved to be necessary 
for high educational efficiency, we can not afford the ultimate extravagance 
which is involved in undue parsimony in such a case. It should not be over- 
looked that the aim of the proposed standard of salaries * * * is not so 
much to improve the position and prospects of the teaching profession, as to 
secure in the future, for the benefit of the State, an adequate supply of amply 
efficient recruits for our educational army. 
THE REFORM OF EDUCATION. 
The demands for educational reorganization in Scotland have been 
as insistent as in England and were supported by the public and the 
teachers. The directions of desirable reforms were summarized in 
a report + of the Scottish education reform committee, an organization 
representing the Educational Institute, the Secondary Educational 
Association, and, the Class Teachers’ Federation. The attitude of 
the teachers on the desirability of a national program that would 
unify all branches of education on the basis of national needs is well 
indicated by the amalgamation of their three principal organizations 
in the Educational Institute. The professional solidarity thus at- 
tained offers a guarantee of educational progress. The education 
reform committee through a number of subcommittees issued recom- 
mendations on administration and finance, general education, the

1 Reform in Scottish Education, being the Report of the Scottish Education Reform 
Committee. (Edinburgh, 1917.)
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The committee urges the abolition of the parish school board system 
and the substitution of county councils and town councils, acting 
through education committees. Voluntary and endowed schools 
should be brought within the scope of the national system. For the 
purpose of coordinating local and central control of education the 
appointment is recommended of a national education council, con- 
sisting of representatives of (a) the Scotch Education Department; 
(8) local education authorities; (c) universities, provincial com- 
mittees, central institutions; (d) teachers engaged in the various 
types of schools; (¢) other legitimate interests. Such a body would 
make available the advice of experts on a larger scale than by means 
of the representation of teachers on the local education committees, 
which is also advocated. The nationalization of the educational sys- 
tem should, in the opinion of the committee, be stimulated by a re- 
vision of the methods of making grants, so that two main purposes 
will be promoted—the establishment of a national scale of salaries 
and the encouragement of progress by the a8sumption of a definite 
share of other approved expenditure. In addition to these two prin- 
ciples, special aid should be given to the highlands and the islands 
to equalize the burden of these poorer districts. 
On the subject of school organization the committee emphasizes 
the need of medical inspection and treatment and other provisions 
for physical welfare. Attendance at school for full time should be 
made compulsory up to 15, and for part time up to 18. Recommen- 
dations are offered on the size of schools and classes. The curricu- 
lum should be reviewed in order to determine what subjects are indis- 
pensable and to eliminate what is merely traditional: and nonessential. 
The time saved in this way, and by the simplification of spelling and 
by the introduction of the metric system and decimal coinage, could 
be utilized for practical work. Emphasis is placed on the importance 
of religious instruction and moral education, direct, indirect, and 
incidental, not only in and through the school, but also by the cooper- 
ation of all the influences affecting the life of children. “ Inter- 
national polity should be one of the aims of moral education, and the 
ethical code of the individual ought, mutatis mutandis, to be that for 
the nation as well.” Differentiation, of course, is urged to meet the 
needs of girls and of pupils in rural intermediate and secondary 
schools. Improvements are advocated in the system of external ex- 
aminations. 
Since “the key of all educational reform lies in the improvement 
of the status, training, conditions of service, and emoluments of the 
teacher,” these subjects receive detailed consideration. The prelimi- 
nary training of candidates for the profession should be the same as 
that of other students in secondary schools, and their admission to 
training colleges should be in the hands of a board of contro] repre-
-P-A-G-E-117
EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 117 
senting the provincial committees and the training centers. The 
training colleges should be affiliated as professional schools with the 
universities in which the students should pursue their academic 
studies. The length of the training course should be three years for 
undergraduates and one year for graduates. Teachers should not be 
granted certificates before the age of 21, while two years’ satisfactory 
service should be required for the final certificate. Greater freedom 
for the teachers and their representation on bodies administering 
education are measures suggested for the improvement both of their 
status and of education in general, to both of which a national scale 
of salaries and prospects for advancement to the inspectorate would 
contribute. 
In discussing technical education the report considers the raising 
of the school leaving age to 15, and compulsory attendance at con- 
tinuation classes fundamental to the efficiency of apprenticeship, 
which should be made obligatory wherever practicable. The coopera- 
tion of teachers and expert advisers in technical education, the co- 
ordination of efforts in the technical schools, central institutions, and 
universities, close relationships between the trades and technical edu- 
cation, and the promotion of scientific and industrial research are 
regarded as essential. Similar recommendations are made for com- 
mercial education. The universities should cooperate with secondary, 
technical, and commercial schools, and utilize by affiliation work in 
other institutions on a university level. More attention should be 
given to the teaching of pure and applied science, to modern lan- 
guages, and to education by the establishment of a chair in this sub- 
ject in each university. Greater autonomy among the universities 
and specialization of the various universities along different lines 
should be encouraged. Finally “a university should be the center 
of its educational area, and should lend all its resources and influence 
to the higher education of the working population,” employing 
methods that have been attended with so much success in the organi- 
zation of the Workers’ Educational Association in England and the 
people’s high schools in Denmark. 
THE SCOTTISH EDUCATION BILL. 
The need of some reorganization is perhaps greater in Scotland 
than in England, which, eliminating the smaller area, developed a 
sound administrative system in 1902. The remarkable educational 
tradition of the country has tended to retard the development of an 
administrative reform more suited to modern needs. Successful as 
this tradition has been in selecting talent and promoting boys of 
ability, it has not been effective in raising the general average. As 
in England, compulsory attendance laws were subject to local exemp- 
tions, voluntary measures for educating adolescent boys and girls
-P-A-G-E-118
    118 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF) EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
were not. successful, and in many parts of the country accessible 
secondary schools were not provided. . Under the existing system 
there are nearly 1,000 school boards elected ad hoc in the burghs and 
parishes; each voluntary and endowed school-is under its own ad- 
ministrative authority; while secondary education since 1908 is ad- 
ministered by nearly 40 secondary school committees. 
At the close of 1917 a bill to reduce this system to some more uni- 
fied plan of organization was introduced in Parliament by the Secre- 
tary for Scotland. The bill followed the English administrative 
system somewhat—each. county council and the councils of the’ five 
chief burghs (Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dundee, and Leith), 
were to be the education authorities of their respective areas, assisted 
by district education committees and local school committees. This 
proposal met with considerable opposition, the fear being expressed 
that the administration of education would be reduced to the level of 
that of sewers, water, and gas. If the smaller local school board must 
surrender its functions to a board covering a wider area, that board, 
too, should be elected ad hoc and in this way make use of the accumu- 
lated experience of the older school board members. On August 6, 
1918, a new bill was substituted, giving effect to. this demand for 
ad hoc boards. 
The central administration is to continue as hitherto in the hands 
of the Scotch Education Department, which is empowered to estab- 
lish an advisory council consisting, to the extent of not less than two- 
thirds of its membership, of persons qualified to represent the in- 
terests of education. The function of the council will be to adyise 
and make recommendations to the department. 
The counties and the five large burghs are set up as education 
authorities administered by boards specially elected for the purpose 
by the local government electors. The number of electoral districts 
and the constitution of each education authority are to be determined 
by the Secretary for Scotland. ‘Each education authority will be 
required to present a scheme for the approval of the Scotch Educa- 
tion Department for the establishment of school management com- 
mittees, including a representative of the authority, one teacher, and 
local representatives, for the general management and supervision 
of schools, but without*any financial powers. 
The education authority will be required to raise money for edu- 
cation and control the expenditure; appoint, transfer, or dismiss 
teachers; establish or discontinue intermediate or secondary schools 
or control institutions for advanced technical instruction; and pro- 
vide bursaries and facilitate attendance at secondary and higher 
schools.. Further, the education authority is charged with the duty 
of preparing schemes for the adequate provision of free elementary, 
intermediate, and secondary schools, and for the support of certain  
-P-A-G-E-119
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 119 
schools charging fees, and of drawing up schemes of scales of salaries 
on the basis of a minimum national scale recommended by a depart- 
mental committee. (See pp. 112f.) 
Contributions must also be made by ‘education authorities toward 
the maintenance of the training colleges for teachers in proportion to 
the number of fully qualified teachers in their areas, and aid may also 
be extended to central institutions and universities, provided reason- 
able representation on their governing bodies is granted. “As an 
ancillary means of promoting education” an authority may furnish 
books for general reading not only to children and young persons but 
also to adults, and in this service is to cooperate financially and other- 
wise with public libraries, where they exist. Each education au- 
thority is required to establish an advisory council of persons quali- 
fied to represent the interests of education, whose duty shall be to 
advise and make recommendations for the consideration of the au- 
thority. For the purpose of developing a national system of adminis- 
tration the bill permits the managers and trustees of voluntary or 
denominational schools to transfer such schools to the education 
authorities. A school so transferred will become a public school, 
receiving the same grants as a public school. The teachers of such a 
school must be taken over by the authority and paid the same scale 
of salaries as public-school teachers, provided that the department is 
satisfied with their qualifications and the church or denomination con- 
cerned with their religious character. The same time will be de- 
voted after the transfer as before it to religious instruction, which is 
to be placed under an approved supervisor. Public grants will not 
be paid to voluntary schools not transferred to the education 
authorities within two years of the passing of the bill. 
If it is found 10 years after the transfer has been made that the 
religious character of the district served by a transferred school has 
changed, such a school by authority of the department may become a 
public school in all respects. On the other hand, on the representa- 
tion of parents as to the need of accommodation for the children ‘of 
any denomination the department may approve the erection of new 
schools of the same character as a transferred school. This provision 
is likely to encounter the severest opposition. It is argued that every 
denomination except that which preponderates in Scotland would be 
enabled by the proposal to have its own sectarian belief propagated in 
schools maintained by public funds. The situation is similar to that 
established in England by the education act of 1902, and the history 
of education across the border since that date may help to remove 
the danger of organized opposition to the bill in general on the 
ground of this provision alone. 
The schools are to be maintained by grants, loans, and an annual 
levy of an education rate to meet any deficiency that:may occur. 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
    120 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The rate is to be apportioned to each parish in an educational area 
in accordance with the local valuations. The State grants will con- 
sist of the education fund established in 1908, an annual appropria- 
tion equal to the educational estimates for the financial year 1913-14, 
which is to be considered for purposes of the law as the standard 
year, and a sum equal to eleven-eightieths of the excess of the annual 
estimates for education in England and Wales over the sums ex- 
pended in the standard year. 
The bill provides for the establishment of nursery schools for chil- 
dren between the ages of 2 and 5, in which attention must be given 
to health, nourishment, and physical welfare. Compulsory school 
attendance begins at the age of 5 and is extended by the bill to the 
age of 15, the pupils entering and leaving school on definitely fixed 
dates. No exemptions from school attendance may be granted to 
pupils under the age of 138. Child labor on school days between the 
hours of 6 o’clock in the evening and 8 o’clock in the morning is 
entirely prohibited, and children between 18 and 15 may be employed 
only if definitely exempted from school attendance. Street trading 
by children under 17 is forbidden, while no child under 15 may be 
employed in factories, workshops, mines, or quarries. 
Children leaving elementary schools at the age of 15, and not 
exempted by virtué of attendance at an intermediate or secondary 
school or of having reached the age of 17 and an equivalent educa- 
tional standard, will be compelled, if the bill passes, to attend a con- 
tinuation school up to the age of 18. For the present the compulsory 
age limit will be 16 within one year of the date on which the bill, 
if enacted, comes into operation, to be raised to 18 as soon thereafter 
as the department may decide. Attendance will be required between 
the hours of 8 o’clock in the morning and 7 o’clock in the evening 
for 320 hours a year without increasing the total period of employ- 
ment permitted for young persons by Parliament. 
The education authorities, who are permitted to delegate the man- 
agement and supervision of continuation schools to school manage- 
‘ment committees or to appoint special committees for the purpose, 
on which they are represented, are required, after consultation with 
and with the cooperation of associations and committees of employers 
and workmen in commerce and trades, to draft schemes for con- 
tinuation schools. Such schemes must include English language and 
literature and such other parts of a general education as may be 
deemed desirable, physical exercises, and special instruction intended 
to promote efficiency in the vocation in which the young persons may 
be engaged. Fines for irregular attendance are to be imposed on 
the young persons concerned and on employers who do not afford 
the necessary opportunity for regular and punctual attendance at 
continuatién schools.
-P-A-G-E-121
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 121 
‘ The bill makes no special provision for secondary or higher educa- 
tion, but authorities are indirectly required to increase the facilities 
by the provision that “no child or young person resident in their 
education area who is qualified for attendance at an intermediate or 
secondary school, and in their opinion shows promise of profiting 
thereby, shall be debarred therefrom by reason of the expense in- 
volved.” An education authority is accordingly required to furnish 
the necessary assistance in such cases by the payment of fees, travel- 
ing expenses, scholarships, or maintenance allowances to encourage 
attendance not.only at intermediate or secondary schools, but also at 
universities, teachers’ training colleges, or central institutions for 
technical instruction. 
The bill was passed in November, 1918. The amendment of the 
original plan of administration cleared one of the chief subjects of 
contention out of the way. Any obstacles that might have been raised 
to the enactment of the continuation school measure had already been 
removed by the discussions on the similar provision in the English 
act. The unanimous support of the teachers was assured by the 
refusal to grant recognition to any schools in which the minimum 
national scale of salaries has not been adopted. The only difficulty 
that remains, and one which has always proved a serious stumbling 
block, is the revival of the religious difficulty involved in the transfer 
of the voluntary schools. The probability is, however, that the na- 
tional needs of the moment will prove sufficient to secure the solidar- 
ity necessary for the enactment of the bill.

An Act to make further provision with respect to education in Scotland and for purposes 
connected therewith. [21st November, 1918.] 
Be it enacted by, the King’s most Hxcellent Majesty, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present 
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows: 
Education Authorities. 
1. A local authority for the purposes of education (in this act called’ the 
“education authority”) shall be elected in and for each of the following areas 
(in this act called “ education areas”), that is to say, in and for— 
(a) Bach of the burghs mentioned in the first schedule. to this act (in this 
act called the “scheduled burghs”) ; and 
{b) Every county, including every burgh situated therein not being one 
of the scheduled burghs. 
2. (1) For the purpose of such elections, the Secretary for Scotland shall, as 
soon as may be after the passing of this act, by order divide each education area 
into electoral divisions, and in determining the boundaries thereof, he shall 
have regard, so far as may be, to the boundaries of wards in scheduled burghs, 
and of districts, burghs, and parishes in counties. 
(2) The Secretary for Scotland shall also by order determine the number 
of members to be elected to each education authority, and shall apportion them 
among the electoral divisions of the education area. In making such deter- 
mination and apportionment the Secretary for Scotland shall have regard to 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
    EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 123 
the population, area, and other circumstances of the scheduled burgh or county, 
as the case may be, and the electoral divisions thereof. 
(3) Before making an order under’ this section, the Secretary for Scotland 
shall cause the proposed order to be published in such matiner as to make the 
same known to all persons interested, and shall, after considering any objec- 
tions and representations respecting the proposed order, and causing a local 
inquiry to be held if he sees fit to'do so, thereafter make the order and cause 
the same'to be forthwith published in the Edinburgh Gazette and in a news: 
paper circulating in the education area. 
8. (1) It shall be the duty of every education authority to prepare and sub- 
mit to the department for their approval a scheme or ‘schemes for the consti- 
tution of committees (in this act called “ school management committees”) for 
the management of schools or ‘groups of schopls under their control throughout 
their education area. 
Every such scheme shall contain provision— 
(a) For the due representation on each school management committee of 
the education authority and of the parents of the children attending 
the schools under the management of such committee; and 
(b) For the appointment thereto, on the nomination of the teachers en- 
gaged in the schools under the management of such committee, or, 
failing such nomination, directly, of at least one such teacher; and 
also 
(c) In the case.of a school management committee having under its man- 
agement one or more transferred schools, for the appointment thereto 
of at least one member in whose selection’ regard shall be had to 
the religious belief of the parents of the children attending such 
school or schools. 
Further, in the case of a county, every such scheme shall have regard to the 
désirability of constituting separate school management committees for indi- 
vidual burghs and parishes, and shall provide for the appointment thereto, on 
the nomination of local bodies (including town and parish councils and at the 
first constitution outgoing school boards), or, failing such nomination, directly, 
‘of persons resident in the locality and otherwise qualified to represent local 
interests in school management. 
(2) A school management committee shall, subject except as hereinafter 
provided to any regulations and restrictions made by the education authority, 
have all the powers and duties of that authority in regard to the general man- 
agement and supervision of the school or group of schools, including attendance 
thereat : Provided, That in the case of a county a school management committee 
having under its management a secondary school shall have all the said powers 
and duties not subject to any such regulations or restrictions: Provided further, 
That the education authority shall in every case themselves retain, exercise, and 
perform all their powers and duties in regard to— 
(a) The raising of money by rate or loan and the general control of ex- 
penditure ; 
(b) The acquisition or holding of land; 
(c) The appointment, transfer, remuneration, and dismissal of teachers; 
(d) The appointment of bursars and the exercise of the powers conferred 
by the section of this act relating to power to facilitate attendance at 
secondary schools and other institutions; and 
(e) The recognition, establishment, or discontinuance of intermediate or 
secondary schools or of centers of advanced technical instruction,  
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Powers and Duties of Hducation Authorities, 
4, (1) It shall be lawful for an education authority, with a view to securing 
that no child or young person resident in their education area who is qualified 
for attendance at an intermediate or secondary school, and in their opinion 
formed after consideration of a report from the teachers concerned shows 
promise of profiting thereby, shall be debarred therefrom by reason of the ex- 
pense involved, to grant assistance in the case of any such child or young person 
by payment of traveling expenses, or of fees, or of the cost of residence in a 
hostel, or of a bursary or maintenance allowance, or any combination of these 
forms of assistance, or otherwise, as the authority think fit. And it shall also 
be lawful for an education authority similarly to assist any duly qualified person 
resident in their education area to enter or attend a university, or a training 
college, or a central institution (including classes affiliated thereto), or in special 
cases any other educational institution approved for the purpose by the depart- 
ment. 
(2) It shall further be lawful for an education authority to grant assistance 
by payment of traveling expenses necessarily incurred in the case of any person 
resident in their education area in attending continuation classes under a 
scheme for instruction in such classes as in this act provided. 
(3) Any assistance granted under this section shall be such as the education 
authority consider proper and necessary, having regard to the circumstances ‘of 
each case, including the circumstances of the parents. ie 
5. It shall be lawful for the education authority of a county, as an ancillary 
means of promoting education, to make such provision of books by purchase or 
otherwise as they may think desirable, and to make the same available not only 
to the children and young persons attending schools or continuation classes in 
the county, but also to the adult population resident therein. 
For the purposes of this section an education authority may enter into 
arrangements with public libraries, and all expenses incurred by an education 
authority for those purposes shall be chargeable to the county education 
fands: * %a* 
6. (1) It shall be the duty of every education authority within 12 months 
after the appointed day to prepare and submit for the approval of the depart- 
ment— 
(a) A scheme for the adequate provision throughout the education area of 
the authority of all forms of primary, intermediate, and secondary 
education in day schools (including adequate provision for teaching 
Gaelic in Gaelic-speaking areas) without payment of fees, and if the 
authority think fit for the maintenance or support (in addition and 
without prejudice to such adequate provision as aforesaid) of a lim- 
ited number of schools where fees are charged in some or all of the 
classes ; 
(0) A scheme for the exercise by the education authority of their powers 
under the section of this act relating to power to facilitate attend- 
ance at secondary schools and other institutions, together with an 
estimate of the expenditure involved therein; and 
(c) A scheme of scales of salaries for the teachers employed by the author- 
ity satisfying such conditions as to minimum national scales of 
salaries for teachers as may be laid down by the department after 
consultation with representatives of the education authorities and 
of the teaching profession: Provided, That such minimum scales of 
salaries shall be independent of any payment made to teachers out
-P-A-G-E-125
EDUCATION IN GREAT’BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 125 
of any bequest or endowment, the object of which is to secure special 
emoluments to any class of teachers or to the teachers of any special 
locality. 
(2) Every education authority may at any time, and shall if and when so 
required by the department, prepare and submit for the approval of the de- 
partment a revised scheme or modifications of an existing scheme under this 
section. 
(3) Schemes prepared and submitted under this section shall include trans- 
ferred schools. z 
7. Whereas it has been the custom in the public schools of Scotland to give 
instruction in religion to children whose parents did not object to the instruc- 
tion so given, but with liberty to parents, without forfeiting any of the other 
advantages of the schools, to elect that their children should not receiye such 
instruction, be it enacted that education authorities shall be at liberty to con- 
tinue the said custom, subject to the provisions of section 68 (Conscience 
Clause) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1872. 
8. It shall be lawful for every education authority to make arrangements 
for— 
(a) Supplying or aiding the supply of nursery schools for children over 
2 and under 5 years of age (or such later age as may be approved 
by the department) whose attendance at such a school is necessary or 
desirable for their healthy physical and mental development; and 
(bv) Attending to the health, nourishment, and physical welfare of children 
attending nursery schools. 
9. (1) It shall be lawful for every education authority to contribute to the 
maintenance of any school not under their own management which is included 
. in the scheme for the provision of education within the education area of that 
authority approved by the department, and in which the teachers are remuner- 
ated at a rate not lower than the rate for teachers of similar qualifications 
employed by the authority, as also to the maintenance of any central institu- 
tion or university, and to make a reasonable representation of the authority 
on the governing body of‘any such school or central institution (where such 
representation is not already provided for) a condition of any contribution 
other than a contribution required by the following subsection: 
(2) Every education authority shall continue to contribute to the main- 
tenance of any school within their education area but not under their own 
management which at the passing of this act was recognized by the depart- 
ment as an intermediate or secondary school, so long as such school continues 
to be so recognized, an amount not less than the contribution made to such 
school in terms of subsection (4) (a) and (b) of section 17 of the Education 
(Scotland) Act, 1908, in respect of the financial year ending on the 15th day 
of May, 1914, by any secondary education committee whose powers and duties 
are by this act transferred to that education authority: Provided, That the 
amount of the contribution required to be made under this subsection shall 
not exceed the amount by which the income of such school from all other 
sources falls short of the expenditure. ‘ 
Any question arising as to the application of this subsection to any school 
or as to the amount of any contribution so made or to be made shall be deter- 
mined by the department, whose determination shall be final. 
(3) Every education authority shall contribute in each year toward the 
“aggregate expense of maintenance of the training colleges throughout Scotland - 
such sum as the department may determine, being a sum proportioned to the 
number of fully qualified teachers in the service of each education authority 
on the 31st day of March in each year,  
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
(4) It shall be lawful for every education authority with the sanction of 
the department to contribute to the maintenance of any educational institu- 
tion or agency, where such contribution appears to the department desirable 
for the educational benefit of persons resident within the education area of 
the authority. 
10. Where an education authority or any other governing body provide and 
maintain a school, not conducted for profit, which is recognized by the depart- 
ment, and is attended by children whose parents are resident outwith the edu- 
eation area in which the school is situated, there shall be paid in each year to 
that authority or to that governing body, as the case may be, out of the educa- 
tion fund of each education area in which any such parents are so resident, a 
sum equal to the cost of the education of such children (including in such cost 
repayment of and interest on loans for capital expenditure) after deduction, 
(a) in the case of a school maintained by an education authority, of income 
from all sources of income other than education rate, and (0) in the case of a 
school maintained by any other governing body, of income from grants made by 
the department and from fees: Provided, That no payment shall be made under 
this section out of the education fund of any education area in respect of any

IRELAND. 
In spite of the political unrest that has prevailed in Ireland dur- 
ing the past few years, the country has been affected by the educa- 
tional progress of England, Wales, and Scotland. If the pressure 
of circumstances has emphasized the demands for increases of salary, 
that problem is intimately associated with the desire to improve the 
professional status of teachers and thereby to improve the schools. It 
is beginning to be recognized that Ireland’s greatest need in educa- 
tion is not so much the reform of this or that, branch of education as 
a unification of the different interests into a national system. Few 
countries can produce a parallel to the tripartite scheme of adminis- 
tration that must inevitably retard educational progress in Ireland. 
Even though the functions of the Commissioners of National Educa- 
tion, who have charge of elementary education, the Intermediate 
Education Board, which administers secondary education, and the 
Department of Agricultural and Technical Education do not as a 
rule overlap, they necessarily lead to a conception of education by 
compartments, which is difficult from the administrative standpoint 
and unjustifiable on public grounds. To these difficulties must be 
added the sectarian situation, which is another factor that militates 
against any plans for a successful national scheme. The political ele- 
ment, disturbing as it is for national welfare, has not affected the course 
of education recently, and it is probable that education is the one ques- 
tion on which all political parties could cooperate, just as all parties 
and creeds appear to speak with one voice on the inadequacy of the

sums received from the imperial treasury in its relation to Irish 
education. : 
The association of some teachers with the Sinn Fein rebellion of 
1916 gave rise to a general charge against the character of the 
teaching in the national schools. As the result of an inquiry, con- 
ducted by the Commissioners of National Education, the conclusion 
was reached that the amount of disaffection among teachers was very 
slight, and that “even in districts where it might be supposed that 
disaffection would be apparent, they found many signs in the pupils’ 
exercises that distinctly loyal ideas had been encouraged by the 
teachers.” It might be pointed out, however, as the commissioners 
did, that national teachers are forbidden to take part in political 
agitation. The charges that were leveled against the teachers were 
extended to the textbooks in history; on examination of these books 
the commissioners ordered that the use of some of them should be dis- 
continued. Textbooks are issued by commercial publishers, and their 
use is sanctioned by the commissioners. 
During the period of the war school attendance has declined some- 
what as a result of the exploitation of child labor. In order to en- 
courage pupils to remain at school at least until the completion of 
the sixth grade instead of drifting away into blind-alley occupations, 
the national commissioners in June, 1916, inaugurated the experi- 
ment of introducing an examination for the higher grade certificates 
for boys and girls who have passed the sixth grade. The experiment 
was successful in Belfast and is to be extended to Dublin and Cork. 
It is hoped that the certificates will come to be recognized by larger 
employers as the minimum educational qualifications for employment. 
The course of the war imposed large economies on educational ex- 
penditure, particularly in such matters as buildings, printing, and 
the collection of statistics. The rapid rise in the cost of living worked 
particular hardship on teachers of all grades, since salaries in many 
cases fell below the minimum standard wage of $6 a week paid to 
agricultural laborers. In July, 1914, a new scale of salaries, with 
annual instead of the prevailing triennial increments, was promised 
to elementary school-teachers, but was not put into force owing to the 
outbreak of war. From July 1, 1916, a war bonus came into effect 
for those in receipt of salaries below $15 a week; the total cost of 
this increase for the year was $825,000, giving an average bonus of 
about 80 cents a week. This did not quell the agitation, which seemed 
to divert the energies of Irish teachers from their real function. In 
September, 1917, largely as a result of the example set by Mr. Fisher’s 
additional grant to English education, the sum of $1,920,000 was 
granted for Irish elementary education over and above the ordinary 
estimates, as the equivalent of Ireland’s share in the imperial taxa- 
tion. A large share of this sum is to be devoted to salary increases.  
-P-A-G-E-138

More extensive reforms are needed, however, than the improvement 
of the teachers’ status. Something has been done to develop school 
gardens, and special courses in horticulture are given to teachers in 
training to promote this work. Medical inspection of school children 
has hardly had a beginning, and, although funds are provided since 
1914 for the payment of grants for dental clinics, they have as yet 
shown no development, since local authorities are unable to levy local 
rates for the purpose. In 1914 power was given to provide meals to 
necessitous children in the schools, but this measure is also likely to 
languish, owing to the inertia of local bodies. Attempts to expand the 
curriculum by the introduction of woodwork for boys and domestic 
science for girls are blocked not only by lack of funds locally, but by 
the inability to secure more money from the Treasury. A revision 
of the school programs is under way, and the need is felt of making 
them more adaptable to the demands of industrial and rural centers. 
Conferences have been conducted with teachers, inspectors, principals 
of secondary and technical schools, and chambers of commerce. Espe- 
cially urgent is the provision of more opportunities for boys and 
girls between the ages of 12 and 16. Other needs that are recognized 
are the provision of pensions, increased grants for teacher-training 
colleges, the establishment of higher elementary schools and day and 
evening continuation schools, the appointment of divisional inspec- 
tors, the supply of books and stationery for pupils, and residence 
grants for teachers. It is estimated that these reforms would require 
additional grants rising from about $4,000,000 to $5,000,000 a year. 
But the realization of even these plans of reorganization would only 
be a very partial installment of the complete revision that Irish educa- 
tion needs to-day to stimulate local effort, to develop local systems of 
administration, and to articulate all branches of education from the 
infant schools to the universities. 
Secondary or intermediate education shows in Ireland, as elsewhere 
in the British Isles, increased attendance; and each year produces a 
larger number of candidates for the examinations conducted by the 
Intermediate Education Board. Since 1908 the examination system 
which was established in 1878, and upon the results of which grants 
are paid by the board to the schools, has been supplemented by a 
system of inspection. In 1913 the examination of pupils below the 
age of 14 was abolished. During the past four years there has been 
a recrudescence of the criticism periodically leveled against the sys- 
tem. The board states in its report for 1916 that the system has its 
limitations, and that an examination conducted once a year is not a 
test. The hoard has only a fixed sum to devote to the support of inter- 
mediate education, and the success of one school means the diminution 
of the grant to another. Struggling schools can not be assisted, new 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  EDUCATION IN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND. 139 
ones can not be established without reducing the grants, and facilities 
can not be extended to encourage elementary school pupils to continue 
toa higher education. Finally, the board had until recently no power 
of investigating schools which may still produce successful results 
in. the examinations without being efficient in other desirable respects. 
The board is inclined to favor two examinations, the one leading to 
the intermediate certificate at about the age of 16, and the other to 
the leaving certificate at the age of 19. The grants should not depend 
primarily on examination results but should be distributed on a 
capitation basis to schools meeting certain standards of efficiency; 
for example, in such matters as the maintenance of regular attend- 
ance, the qualifications of teachers, and the number of pupils pre- 
sented for the two examinations mentioned. Only in some such way 
could adaptation to modern needs be encouraged. 
Similar recommendations have been urged by the teachers, who, 
although actuated primarily by the urgent need for an improvement 
in their economic and professional status, are also ready to promote 
the new tendencies. As in the case of elementary education, the 
reform of secondary education is closely dependent on. financial con- 
siderations. Intermediate education is supported by the local taxa- 
tion duties and certain funds resulting from the disestablishment of 
the Irish church. These sums are decreasing, while the number of 
schools and pupils is constantly increasing. Ireland demands a share 
in the imperial revenue equivalent to those given to England and 
Wales. and Scotland. It is variously estimated that this share would 
amount to about $500,000. In 1917 an equivalent grant of $250,000 
was secured for Irish intermediate education, part of which was for 
the establishment of courses for teachers, part set aside for aiding 
buildings and equipment, and the rest to be distributed as a capita- 
tion grant among the schools complying with certain conditions. 
The most important of these conditions is that a school must employ 
a qualified teacher for the first 40 pupils and an additional teacher 
for each additional 20 pupils. Such. teachers must be paid $100 a 
year over the minimum set down in the regulations governing the 
distribution of the Birrell grant of $200,000 a year, passed in 1914. 
These regulations require that lay teachers for purposes of this 
grant, which was intended for the increase of salaries, must hold a 
university degree or have had two years of experience, and be paid 
a minimum salary of $700 a year, if men, and $450 a year, if women, 
Much dissatisfaction has attended the distribution of the Birrell 
grant, and the increases of salary of qualified lay teachers have been 
slight; the situation is well indicated by the fact that the highest 
salary paid to a lay teacher in a Roman Catholic school is $800 a 
year, while only a few receive over $1,000 and still fewer over $1,500 
a year in Protestant schools,
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The teachers have, however, an opportunity of developing profes- 
sional solidarity which should in time lend weight to their recom- 
mendations. The Birrell Act of 1914 provided for the establishment 
of a registration council for intermediate teachers. A council was 
appointed in 1915 and, although it drafted rules in the same year, 
nothing further was accomplished until April, 1918, when the inter- 
mediate board assumed its functions and issued rules in the following 
month. Until 1925 it is expected that existing teachers can be regis- 
tered without much difficulty. Ultimately the qualifications for reg- 
istration required will be raised to include a university degree or its 
equivalent, a diploma indicating a year of professional training, and 
three years of experience. These requirements should stimulate the 
professional training of secondary school teachers, especially men, as 
nothing else has done. With a trained teaching profession it seems 
hardly possible that the present system should continue unaltered. 
The view has already gained wide acceptance that future progress 
of Irish education requires the establishment of a ministry of educa- 
tion with three divisions, for elementary, secondary, and technical 
education, and an advisory council for each. The needed reforms 
in secondary education have been summarized in the report made in 
July, 1917, by its education committee to the senate of Queen’s Uni- 
versity, Belfast: 
That this committee is convinced that the time has come for a thorough re- 
organization of secondary education in Ireland; (1) in order to improve the 
tone and character of education by limiting the pressure of examinations, and 
giving, subject to proper superintendence, greater freedom to the teachers and 
managers of schools; (2) in order to raise the status and add to the remuner- 
ation of secondary-school teachers, so as to attract able and highly trained 
persons to the profession; (3) in order to obtain a close coordination of primary 
and secondary systems of education by placing them under one control; that 
to secure these ends much larger financial provision for education should be 
made by the State; and that the grant to Ireland should be proportionately 
equivalent to that which is proposed for England and Scotland. 
This report, combined with the statement by the Intermediate Edu- 
cation Board of the limitations of the system that it administers, 
should be far-reaching in their effects. Such considerations need to 
be further supplemented by inquiries into the possible sources of aid 
from local authorities which hitherto have given very little support 
to secondary education, slight support to elementary education, and 
comparatively large assistance to technical education. Committees of 
‘inquiry, though limited to investigations of the status of teachers, 
were appointed during 1918. Neither of these can go very far in the 
consideration of their problems without branching out into the larger 
and more important problem that is still far from solution—the re- 
construction of Irish education in all its phases.

EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DOMINION OF CANADA.

GENERAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES, 
Certain educational activities are common to most, if not all, of 
the Provinces of the Dominion; and these will be considered in their 
general bearings before the local and individual problems of the 
several Provinces are taken up. Chief of these general movements 
are the following: 
THE LANGUAGE ISSUE. 
Having its roots deep in what is perhaps the greatest diversity of 
racial origins in the world, Canada’s problem of solving the question 
of permitting the establishment and maintenance of schools giving 
instruction in other tongues than English presents difficulties even 
more complex than in any State of the American Union. Accord- 
ing to immigration statistics, Canada has within the past 10 years 
141
-P-A-G-E-142
    142 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
received waves of immigration from 26 distinct racial entities. For- 
tunately, there is not to be noted a:corresponding number of divisions 
of the language problem. The great majority are too few in number 
to segregate themselves solidly apart from the English and French 
populations. The groups which distinctively show and carry out 
such a tendency are the German, Polish, and Ruthenian. The bear- 
ings of the question on the social, economic, and political sides are, of 
course, manifold; but this treatment concerns itself only with its 
bearings upon education, and essentially upon the elementary phase. 
This field alone shows such diversity in the ways the problem must be 
solved by the individual Provinces as to call for a survey separately 
or by groups. 
The situation in the Maritime Provinces of Prince Edward 
Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia may be dismissed with 
slight notice. This group differs fundamentally from all the 
others in being essentially homogeneous in population. From con- 
siderations of geography, climate, and pursuits, immigration has 
uniformly passed them by. The situation is therefore the simple 
one of rivalry between the French and the English language. De- 
spite a large proportion of Acadians left in each of these three ° 
Provinces, the religious and educational relations between the 
French and English have always been so amicable, and legal com- 
promises have been so skillful, as to forestall all friction. Nova 
Scotia’s settlement of-the problem may be taken as typical. In 
that Province a special inspector (an Acadian) is provided for 
Acadian schools; brief summer courses in colloquial English are 
provided in the Provincial Normal College at Truro for French- 
speaking teachers; in the first four grades French readers are pro- 
vided for French-speaking children, with instruction in colloquial 
English, and English-speaking teachers are not required to know 
French. 
Proceeding westward, Quebec presents the problem of bilingual 
instruction distinctively along the line of religious faith; and her 
solution is eminently satisfactory of what might be, with less tact- 
ful handling, the most dangerous combination of religious and 
racial jealousies. The general line of cleavage adopted is, as may 
be expected, English for and in the Protestant schools, and French 
for and in the Roman Catholic schools, though a confusing element 
intervenes in the English-speaking Irish population of Quebec and 
Montreal. By wise provisions of the Protestant committee of the 
provincial board of education, French courses of study are included 
in those of the Protestant schools, being required from the fourth 
to the eleventh grade, and in the comparatively few French Protes- 
tant schools French is the language of instruction, with required 
courses in English. Similarly, the committee of Catholic schools
-P-A-G-E-143
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 143 
provides for the use of French for instruction, and requires Eng- 
lish from the first year in the great majority of such schools; and in 
the Catholic schools of Irish and English communities the converse 
provision is made. In the populous centers some Catholic schools 
use one language for instruction in the morning and the other in 
the afternoon; and in the Catholic superior schools the training in 
English is notably fine. The key which simplifies the situation 
is that the racial elements in Quebec are locally distinct. The 
hope expressed by the superintendent of public instruction the month 
the war broke out that local good sense and patriotism would over- 
come any difficulty has been amply fulfilled. 
Geographically and in population Ontario has many points of 
resemblance to Quebec; but an important dissimilarity lies in the 
overwhelming majority of the English-speaking population (about 
2,000,000) over the minority of all those speaking other languages 
(about half a million). Without anticipating the treatment of the 
strictly educational system of Ontario, it may be said that, barring 
the independence of religious schools found in Quebec, Ontario 
allows much the same language privileges to the minority. Historic 
traditions of sentiment and race loyalty clustering around the city 
of Quebec have always deeply impressed the French-speaking popu- 
lation in Ontario as well, and this feeling is even intensified by their 
being unable to have enacted into law such concessions as those en- 
joyed by their kinsmen in the Province of Quebec. Furthermore, a 
steady tide of the latter set in a generation ago into Ontario. The 
displacement of English-speaking farmers that followed served still 
further to widen the breach of race and language. Regulations of in- 
creasing severity requiring the teaching of English in all schools, 
passed by the Department of Education on the basis of recommenda 
tions made by a commission of inquiry, led in 1915 and 1916 to acute 
and in some localities disastrous situations in French schools and 
school boards. The trouble was settled in November, 1916, by the 
judgment of the Privy Council of the Dominion, which held that the 
right to the use of a certain language concerns only legislative or 
court use, and does not relate to education, but that the right to man- 
age schools, as well as that to determine the language to be used in 
them, are alike subject to the regulations of the provincial education 
department. 
In sharp contrast to the homogeneous character of the Maritime 
Provinces and to the absence of a serious language problem there, 
the’ prairie Provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Co- 
lumbia show great racial diversity, due to successive waves of immi- 
gration which followed each other too rapidly to be assimilated. In 
Manitoba’s estimated one million people are to be counted 19 racial 
units not spéaking English, of which 6 number more than 50,000
-P-A-G-E-144
144 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
each, with the aggregate estimated at 60 per cent of the total popula- 
tion of the Province. Some idea of the race diversity may be gained 
from the statement that the Bible is sold in Winnipeg in 58 different 
dialects. Of those speaking a language other than English, the most 
serious problem is presented by the German Mennonites, the Poles, 
the Russian Doukhobors, and the Ruthenians. 
Manitoba, largely under the influence of the educational thought 
of the States of the American Union just to the south, frankly made 
no legal allowance for any system of public instruction other than the 
purely nondenominational; and she could therefore offer no such 
solution of the language problem as that reached by Quebec and 
Ontario. In 1896 a compromise was adopted by which, in localities 
where 10 pupils spoke French or other language than English (pre- 
domantly Mennonite), bilingual teaching must be provided; but 
the French Roman Catholics were not satisfied, and at Winnipeg 
and Brandon maintained separate parochial schools, besides paying 
regular taxes for public schools, 
When the tremendous tide of immigration set in about 1902, each 
racial group took advantage of its legal rights under the above com- 
promise. The climax was reached in 1915 when nearly one-sixth 
of the schools of Manitoba were bilingual—143 teaching French, 70 
German, 121 Polish or Ruthenian, all in addition to English. The 
unwisdom (noted at the time) of the failure to adopt compulsory 
school attendance in Manitoba was now made apparent, especially 
in Ruthenian communities. The first relief afforded was the out- 
right repeal (1915) of the clause requiring bilingual teaching when 
demanded by the parents of as many as 10 children. In Manitoba, 
then, as the situation now stands, no more bilingual teaching certifi- 
cates are issued, and present holders are permitted to teach on the 
old ones until June, 1919, when they will be invited to qualify for — 
regular certificates. English examinations for entrance to normal 
schools have been required since 1917, the substitutes of French or 
German grammar and composition having been abolished. 
In Saskatchewan matters are similar to those in Manitoba. Of 
the alien elements, the Colony Mennonites, the Colony Doukhobors, 
the Ruthenians, and the Germans retarded unification by declining 
to send their children to the public schools which the law provides 
that the community itself may organize. Educational and social 
leaders have thought it best not to compel them, but to wait for the 
influence of new-world surroundings and the example of the inde- 
pendent branch of each religious sect to do their disintegrating work. 
The Ruthenians, who constitute the largest population in the north- 
ern part of the Province, and the Mennonites, among whom entire 
communities formerly evaded the law by simply not organizing the 
legal school district but establishing private parochial schools, offer 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 145 
each of them distinctive phases of the problem to be solved. Over 
these the provincial inspectors had up to 1917 no power whatsover. 
The new school-attendance act of that year, however, gave the depart- 
ment of education power to investigate all nonpublic schools and to 
apply legal pressure when needed, though the law leaves a serious 
loophole for evasion in not requiring “the parent or guardian to 
send the child to public school if the child is under instruction in 
some other satisfactory manner.” Controversy over the interpreta- 
tion of this clause must continue until further legal action settles it. 
In Alberta the very large number of groups speaking other lan- 
guages than English led to the appointment in 1914 of a supervisor 
of foreign schools, vested with large power of supervision and inter- 
ference. Here, as elsewhere, the Ruthenian group gave most trouble, 
as they clung most tenaciously to their parochial schools. Because 
of the widely varying degrees of excellence found in the latter, the 
Government has steadily refused to recognize attendance at such 
schools as fulfilling the compulsory educational requirements. This 
policy, tactfully and yet unswervingly adhered to, has resulted in 
the closing of almost all the Ruthenian schools and of many Ger- 
man-Lutheran private parochial schools conducted by theological 
students from Lutheran colleges in the United States, which were 
considered as not reaching the prescribed standard of efficiency. 
Last of all, and strange to say, parallel to the situation in the 
Maritime Provinces of the east, the extreme western Province of 
British Columbia presents no language problem, though showing 
wide diversity of racial groups, each of which is so small in numbers 
as to offer no trouble in the matter of language instruction in the 
public schools. 
It may safely be concluded that the question of the language of 
instruction throughout the Dominion has steadily tended to a satis- 
factory adjustment since its injection as an issue of extremely bitter 
controversy six years ago. At one time threatening to disrupt boards 
and schools, notably in Ontario, it came to have applied to it the 
spirit of fair play characteristic of western democracy, and the 
general principle of the rule of the majority, tempered with conces- 
sions to local sentiment. 
AGRICULTURAL INSTRUCTION. 
Federal interest in agriculture has expressed itself in two parlia- 
mentary enactments: 
1. The Agricultural Aid Act, passed in 1912, by the provisions of 
which the sum of $500,000 was distributed among the Provinces of 
Canada on the basis of population. While partly educational, the 
objects of this grant were also of a general social and economic 
character, with rural conditions fundamentally in view.

146 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
2. The Agricultural Instruction Act, passed in 1918, by the provi- 
sions of which ten million dollars was set apart to be divided among 
the Provinces for agricultural instruction during the ten years end- 
ing March 31, 1923. As the name implies, this act is preeminently 
educational, and its work falls under four divisions: 
(1) The teaching in the public schools of the first principles of the sciences 
related to agriculture. 
(2) The teaching of more advanced agriculture in agricultural colleges and 
schools devoting their attention to the training of teachers, investigators, and 
community leaders, 
(3) The carrying on of extension work, having for its object the instruction 
of farmers by acquainting them through demonstrations and by other means 
with the results of scientific investigation and research. 
(4) The amelioration of the conditions of rural life, particularly in so far as 
women and children are concerned. 
These objects have been variously carried out in the several 
Provinces, but in them all the nature of the stimulus given to agri- 
cultural instruction has been much the same, being guided by the 
advice of local authorities who have in view urgent local and pro- 
vincial needs. i 
VOCATIONAL WORK FOR RETURNED SOLDIERS. 
The care of the returned Canadian soldier has devolved entirely 
upon the Military Hospitals Commission, established and given ex- 
tensive powers by successive orders’in council. This commission 
works together with a committee of both houses of the Canadian 
. Parliament in the training and reeducation of wounded, disabled, 
and convalescent soldiers. In the system adopted, the training for 
new occupations of men who can not resume their former occupa- 
tions—vocational reeducation—is the phase of deepest educational 
significance. Under this head, and responsible to the commission 
first named, nearly every Province has the following organizations: 
1. A Provincial Disabled Soldiers’ Training Board, which deter- 
mines who are fit subjects for vocational reeducation. 
2. A body having generally advisory powers for securing the co- 
ordination of local efforts and the cooperation of educational insti- 
tutions. 
3. Vocational officials in immediate charge of work in each locality 
under the Vocational Secretary of the Dominion, with headquarters 
at Ottawa. 
4, Various organizations, such as the Returned Soldiers’ Employ- 
ment Commission, which have charge of placing the men in bread- 
winning occupations. ; 
The efficiency with which all these agencies cooperate necessarily 
varies widely in the several Provinces; perhaps the finest illustration 
of the practical working of the general plan is to be seen in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 147 
western Province of Alberta, from which many of the first enlist- 
ments in the Canadian expeditionary force came. At the Military 
Convalescent Hospital at Ogden, military organization and disci- 
pline prevail. In addition to systematic treatment involving occu- 
pational therapy of the most modern type, specialized vocational 
reeducation is given in— 
(1) Commercial courses of six months ; \ 
(2) Instruction of disabled soldiers, foreigners who had enlisted 
in the Canadian forces, in English; 
(8) Civil-service examination courses ; 
(4) Manual arts; 
(5) Gardening and poultry raising; 
(6) Industrial trades along the line of the vocational survey of 
the Province of Alberta projected just as the war broke out, with 
instruction at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art at 
Calgary, organized as a link in the general system of public instrue- 
tion in Alberta, and for the present turned over exclusively to dis- 
abled soldiers. 
Many problems of vocational training are here being worked out 
with remarkable success: The caliber of the students and the rela- 
tion between them and the educational authorities may be seen in 
the fact that a students’ council at the institute has powers of self- 
government, works out programs of study, recently voted for in in- 
crease in daily hours of work, and has frequently been asked for 
advice on the contents of courses. In March, 1918, the vocational 
training branch of the Provincial Invalid Soldiers’? Commission had 
under its instruction more than 3,000 returned soldiers. 
Dominion-wide interest in this world problem did not cease with 
the cessation of hostilities. At the convening of the Canadian Par- 
liament in February, 1919, it was announced in the speech from the 
throne that bills would be submitted for the further promotion of 
vocational education in all its phases, and that a recent order in 
council had provided substantial increase of vocational pay and al- 
lowances to returning soldiers while undergoing such reeducation. 
THE DOMINION EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Perhaps the most vital bond of union between the Provinces from 
the point of view of teaching is the Dominion Educational Associa- 
tion. This includes representatives from each Province, meets an- 
nually in November, in Ottawa, and constitutes a clearing house for 
the interchange of educational ideas, besides contributing substan- 
tially to the growing federalistic consciousness. A few of the salient 
subjects discussed at its 1918 meeting will show the very valuable 
part it serves in educational progress: “The Improvement of School
-P-A-G-E-148
148 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Administration and Its Dependence on Changes in Legislation”; 
“The Fisher Bill of England”; “The Adolescent School Attendance 
Act of Ontario”; “Uniform Textbooks for Canadian Schools”; 
“The Relation of Technical to Complete Education”; “ Education 
for the New World after the War”; “The Returned Soldier—What 
Can We Do for Him? ”; “The Federal Government and Statistics on 
Education in Canada.” Of late years it has invited leading educa- 
tional thinkers of the United States to address it, notably the Com- 
missioners of Education, and thus has come to have a distinctly inter- 
national character. 
THE MARITIME PROVINCES. 
The three Provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince 
Edward Island, by reason of similarity of climate, industries, and 
population, constitute a distinct unit. Their educational problems 
and methods of solution are closely akin, as is evidenced by the 
flourishing maritime educational convention held annually for the 
discussion of topics of common importance, and marking each year 
a distinct growth toward solidarity. ‘In many respects New Bruns- 
wick may be regarded as most progressive; and a survey of edu- 
cational progress there will be largely representative of the other two. 
As in all the other Provinces, the service of the teachers and the edu- 
cational machinery in the winning of the war continued unabated 
until the end, especial interest being taken in the organization of the 
Dominion work in education for Canadian soldiers overseas and in 
the projected establishment of educational facilities in England for 
soldiers detained there after the war. 
The school laws passed within the two years showed marked in- 
crease in educational interest. The powers and responsibilities of 
school trustees were largely increased; the attendance of district rep- 
resentatives upon county or provincial teachers’ or trustees’ insti- 
tutes was encouraged by defraying their expenses; reciprocity of 
teachers of corresponding grades with Nova Scotia, safeguarded by 
the certification of one of the other superintendents of instruction, 
was established; and superior schools in the seventh grade and up- 
ward were declared free to all pupils residing within the parish or 
parishes concerned. Most important of all, however, is the legisla- 
tive act of 1918, defining vocational and prevocational education 
and schools, providing for provincial and local administration and 
control by a committee consisting of the Superintendent of Educa- 
tion, the Principal of the Normal School, the Secretary of Agricul- 
ture, the Director of Elementary Agricultural Education, and three 
others, including one representing capital and one labor, outlining 
the method of establishing schools and departments of vocational edu- 
cation, allowing provincial grants on the basis of equal appropria-
-P-A-G-E-149
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 149 
tions of local taxes for designated instructions in this field; and 
finally, providing that no part of the annual vocational grant shall 
be given to any district, town, or city unless a compulsory school- 
attendance law has been adopted therein. 
Closely related is the project having for its object the establish- 
ment of home efficiency clubs throughout the Province and the 
stimulation of the production of home-canned fruits and vegetables. 
Upon the inauguration of the system late in 1917 one hundred 
clubs were formed, with a total membership of 1,700 girls between 
the ages of 10 and 18 years, The aggregate production of these 
clubs was estimated in 1918 at 50,000 quarts of food canned or 
otherwise preserved. In May, 1918, the Board of Education for- 
mally recognized the movement by the appointment of a woman 
supervisor for girls’ clubs. This official by the end of 1918 had over 
200 active organizations under her direction. A striking feature 
of the movement also was the fact that many domestic-science 
teachers of the Province volunteered to help in this general work 
by giving up three weeks of their summer vacation. In 1918 these 
teachers were regularly employed by the Department of Educa- 
tion to visit the clubs during July and August. In preparation for 
this, short courses were provided in*the normal school, with special 
regard to the local products and conditions of the districts to which 
individual teachers were assigned. 
In the matter of increased production the Dominion-wide move- 
ment was promoted in New Brunswick by the schools in cooperation 
with the agricultural department. The inspectors were summoned 
to a conference, and the Province organized by the selection of 
the most suitable centers in each inspectorial district and the 
appointment of a committee in each. A stimulus was given to 
good scholarship by the provision that only boys whose school 
standing was satisfactory should be allowed to volunteer for this 
work.t Assistance was also lent by the Department of Education 
through the district organizations in the distribution of circular 
and seed-card estimates sent out by the Department of Agriculture. 
With the purpose of securing data at first hand upon the extent 
and methods of free textbook distribution—always a much-mooted 
question in the Dominion—the superintendent of education in 
1917 visited all the western Provinces, and embodied his findings 
in a report containing many other points of interest besides that 
of his immediate object. He found that free readers were sup- 
plied in all the Provinces west of Ontario, and free materials in 
some, free arithmetics, agriculture texts, atlases, and libraries in 
others; that Ontario supplied hand-books in each subject to each   
1 Similar departmental regulations were also issued in Nova Scotia,
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
teacher; that British Columbia was the only Province supplying 
free textbooks throughout; that in Manitoba each district or munici- 
pality was allowed by law to supply its own texts free, with the 
prospect that this would shortly become compulsory; that an inter- 
esting sign of closer unity was seen in the fact that the four western 
Provinces had tentatively agreed to appoint composite committees to 
select uniform textbooks for all. 
NOVA SCOTIA. 
Noteworthy in the educational history of Nova Scotia is the regu- 
lation adopted by the council of public instruction, compulsory from 
August 1, 1919, guaranteeing the raising of teachers’ salaries and 
basing the minimum salary upon the average annual salary paid 
for the five years ended July, 1917. Ranging from $200, the lowest 
hitherto paid, up to $750, increases are graduated according to vari- 
ous percentages, assuring a minimum of $400 in future. The act is 
effectively safeguarded by the provision that— 
the license of any teacher engaging to teach in any section at a less salary 
than that defined above shall at once be suspended, and if-any section engage 
a teacher at less salary than the above specified, such section shall forfeit its 
share of the muncipal fund and Shall not be regarded as having a legal 
school. 
PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND. 
Legislation.in this Province showed marked progress in the follow- 
ing amendment to the section of the Public Schools Act designating 
the requirements of voters at school meetings: 
Notwithstanding anything in this act or amendments thereto, every married 
woman or widow haying one or more children of school age in actual attend- 
ance at the school shall be a qualified voter at all school meetings in respect 
of all matters and things cognizable by a school meeting and shall be eligible 
for election as school trustee. 
In accordance with this amendment women have been elected and 
promptly qualified and have thus come in closer touch with the needs 
and improvement of the schools, 
The compulsory attendance clause of the school act has also been 
strengthened by the following amendment: 
Every person having under his control a child between the ages of 8 and 14 
shall annually during the continuance of such control send such child to some 
public school in the city, town, or school district in the county in which he 
resides at least 30 weeks if such person resides in the town of Charlottetown 
or Summerside and 20 weeks if he resides elsewhere in the Province. 
._ The enforcement of this provision was made obligatory upon all 
boards of trustees.

QUEBEC. 
Any adequate survey of educational progress and conditions in the 
Province of Quebec must be based upon a clear understanding of the 
unique legal character of its public school system. This includes a 
twofold organization which follows sharply the lines of the two 
dominant religious faiths, with each division entirely independent 
of the other. The final control and direction of the Roman Catholic 
schools are vested in the Catholic committee of the council of public 
instruction; those of the Protestant schools in the corresponding 
Protestant committee. Both are under a common superintendent of 
public instruction for the Province, who is ex-officio chairman of 
both, though he usually delegates the actual power in one or the other 
committee, and to whom each inspector general submits an annual 
report for transmission to the secretary of state. Hach committee 
works primarily through its inspector general, whose powers are 
entirely derived from it. In matters of common import the com- 
mittees combine either in whole or in part. 
The great majority of the schools of all grades in the Province are 
Roman Catholic—in 1916-17, 6,562 out of a total of 7,289, enrolling 
approximately 430,000 pupils out of a total of 500,000. Among the 
administrative acts of the Catholic committee for the past two years 
was their declaration in favor of forming classes to prepare young 
pupils for the first-year course of study in the primary schools, and 
the issuance of a certificate of studies upon the completion of the 
elementary, intermediate, and superior courses: 
There is question at this time of a new distribution of the subjects included 
in the courses of the elementary and model schools, in such a way as to 
eliminate those which are not absolutely necessary for these schools, and to 
distribute the subjects over seven years of teaching. 
The Catholic committee also instructed its inspector general to 
initiate a close investigation of the condition and needs of the Catholic 
schools of the Province, and early in 1917 he made the following 
recommendations: 
1. That the course of study in elementary schools.be more effectively 
carried out, rather than have additions of subjects or time. 
2. That the importance of the training of very small children in 
preparation for the first grade of elementary course be recognized 
and more attention be paid to it. 
3. That the men and women teachers of the Bovias be stimu- 
lated to greater professional efficiency both in preparation and in 
permanency in the same school. 
4, That the number of schools under the direction of male teachers 
be increased in all possible ways.
-P-A-G-E-152
  
  152 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
5. That the maximum number of pupils in each class should be 
reduced from 50 to 40. \ 
6, That a certificate of study should be conferred as a reward for 
~ work both to teachers and to pupils, and with the view of encourag- 
ing the latter to pursue their studies beyond the prescribed 13 years. 
Among the administrative acts of the Protestant committee were: 
The indorsement and transmission to the Government of the pro- 
vision for compulsory education for Protestant children, along the 
line 5f the petition of school commissioners of certain towns unani- 
mously presented to the legislature of the Province and the unani- 
mous motion of the Protestant Teachers’ Convention, the Council 
of Public Inspectors, the Provincial Association of School Boards, 
and a few Catholic local school boards; the revision of laws relat- 
ing to the employment in industries of children who had not passed. 
a certain scholastic standard; and the thorough revision of school 
books and courses of study for the year ending June, 1920, in order 
to meet adequately the conditions brought about by the war. 
Each committee has been fortunate in the activity and vigor of 
its inspector general. In 1917 the Catholic inspector general, in 
addition to the investigation outlined above, noted as encouraging 
signs the growth in interest shown by the local school commissions, 
due largely to the conscientious labor of the local inspectors; the de- 
crease in the number of women teachers without diplomas by exactly 
half within the past five years; the increase in salaries such that 
those from $100 to $125 have practically disappeared and that the 
average salary has come to range from $200 to $300, being almost 
doubled in the past six years; the resolution passed by the Roman 
Catholic inspectors, and indorsed by the Protestant inspectors, 
calling upon the committees for such a raising of the minimum 
standards of the rural schools as would qualify all these to partici- 
pate in the minimum salary grants. 
Both Catholic and Protestant committees during 1917 and 1918 
initiated the holding of campaign meetings throughout the Province 
to promote public interest in education, urging the voting of money 
for improved buildings and higher salaries. The Protestant in- 
spector general noted a most encouraging awakening of popular 
interest in many localities in improved school facilities, but em- 
phasized the urgent need of better salaries for rural teachers, if 
any with diplomas were to continue to be available; and he called 
for a minimum salary of $50 per month, which would not be unduly 
burdensome in view of the new tax assessments made in 1918 in 
many localities. He concluded: 
The economic reasons are not confined to the facts that trained teachers 
are allured to other Provinces where the reward is greater; young women of
-P-A-G-E-153

ability are constantly afforded more attractive careers in our own Province as 
trained nurses and as stenographers and typewriters in banks and business 
offices. The war has intensified this demand, and an inadequate supply of 
trained teachers is not only evident now throughout the Province, but is 
bound to become still more inadequate in the immediate future. * * * The 
example of the British Parliament in adopting a great progressive educa- 
tional policy involving increased expenditures in war times is one to be fol- 
lowed. 
ONTARIO, 
THE SUPERANNUATION ACT. . 
The most important piece of educational legislation of the Prov- 
ince of Ontario during the past two years was the teachers’ and in- 
spectors’ superannuation act. Its main provisions are as follows: 
(1) The assessment of 24 per cent upon the salaries of teachers and 
inspectors with an equal sum contributed by the Province, the said 
payments to be deducted from the legislative school grants and to 
be placed to the credit of the superannuation fund, and to be de- 
ducted finally from the individual salaries; (2) pensions based on 
length of service and amount of salary, the minimum being $365, and 
the maximum $1,000 per annum, with the requirement of a mini- 
mum of 30 years’ experience or 15 years if retirement is caused by 
ill health; (3) a controlling board composed of an actuary, two 
other persons appointed by the minister of public instruction, and 
two teachers or inspectors, active members of the Ontario Educa- 
tional Associaton and regularly elected by that body. 
PROPOSED LEGISLATION. 
Of great importance, also, is the introduction of the following 
bills in the legislative assembly of the Province: 
1. The bill for the establishment of a system of consolidated 
schools, following closely the lines of corresponding legislation in 
the prairie Provinces, where such schools have for some years con- 
stituted the basal feature of rural school administration. It is still 
(April, 1919) pending, but is regarded with universal favor, and is 
certain to pass. It marks a long step forward in elasticity of rural 
school administration. 
2. The adolescent school attendance bill, making compulsory part- 
time school attendance of boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 
18. It provides that adolescents between 14 and 16 must have 400 
hours of education each year, and those between 16 and 18 have 320 
hours, and that they can not secure employment unless they shall 
have obtained certificates that they have complied with the law 
or are exempt for legally specified cause. Urban centers of 5,000 
population or over must provide for adolescent school courses.
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
THE EFFECTS OF THE WAR. 
Ag regards the practical operation of the schools of Ontario, the 
effects of the war have been pronounced in the following respects: 
1, In diminishing the normal supply of teachers. According to 
the report of the chief inspector of public and separate schools, not 
only have— . 
A considerable number of teachers enlisted for service overseas, but a much 
greafer number have withdrawn to more lucrative positions with fewer re- 
sponsibilities. 'The loss to the Province, not counting the cost of educating 
these teachers, is sufficient to cause serious alarm to the authorities of the 
elementary schools. The obvious and manifest remedy for this state of affairs 
is to insist that boards of trustees shall adjust the salaries of their teachers 
to the increased cost of living and to the increased wages now earned in other 
occupations. Unless a very considerable increase in salaries of teachers is 
made, a still more serious condition will arise. Not only will the service of 
the teachers now engaged be lost, but students will cease to be attracted to 
the teachers’ training schools. 
2. In decreasing the amounts expended for the improvement and 
construction of school buildings. The inspector just quoted, how- 
ever, finds a compensating advantage which has made for better 
school buildings and better school grounds, viz, the better organiza- 
tion of community life and a tendency to regard the school as its 
center, a movement which had its beginning in the demand made by 
the war for a higher standard of physical efficiency and its revela- 
tion of hitherto unsuspected but widely prevalent physical defects 
through the reports of the Army medical examiners. 
3. In increasing the difficulty of securing the punctual and regu- 
lar attendance of pupils at schools. On this point the same inspector 
reports that the arrangements effected by regulation two years ago 
in view of the exigencies of the war have left something to be desired 
in the way of more specific regulations to compel attendance. The 
truant officer provision has not been found satisfactory: “ With the 
increased cost of wages the temptation for parents to withdraw their 
‘children from. school, especially where fruits and vegetables are 
grown, has necessarily increased.” 
CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
The continuation schools have grown steadily during the past two 
years. In spite of difficulties of accommodation and equipment, the 
favoring regulations and the liberal system of provincial grants 
made to this type of school have advanced their usefulness, though 
with the confusion incidental to the war only the largest centers have 
as yet such schools ‘in full operation. The inspector of the district 
which enrolls the largest number of such schools advocates making 
it obligatory that every continuation school employing two teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 155 
and every high school having four teachers or less shall establish 
departments of agriculture and household economy giving a two- 
year course and winter courses in each; that schools with a staff of 
more than six teachers shall establish departments of technical 
training and household economy; provision should be made for 
training a sufficient number of the best available teachers, the bur- 
den of expense being distributed over the muncipalities that de- 
rive benefit from such a school, and attendance of pupils for the 
greater part of the time between the ages of 14 and 17 being made 
compulsory. 
For the past two years the decrease in the attendance of boys upon 
the continuation schools has been noticable, more particularly among 
the first-year pupils, attributable to the great scarcity of labor on 
the farms, necessitating the work of the larger children at home. In 
industrial centers the decrease is due to the attraction of high-school 
‘boys and girls to employments paying high wages. According to 
the report of the inspector of the district, which shows more dis- 
tinctively rural conditions: 
The continuation schools when first established were expected. to provide 
secondary education for the youth of the rural and village communities of 
the Province, and so had a strong tendency toward training for country life 
by means of making agriculture one of the chief subjects of study., Unfortu- 
nately, these schools have not to any great extent fulfilled such expectations. 
Instead, these schools are simply high schools in rural or village communities, 
with courses similar to those in the city high schools and fitting youths for 
the teaching profession and for entrance to the universities and professional 
colleges. 
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Though the full development of the various types of schools con- 
templated by the industrial education act of 1911 was interrupted — 
by the war, representatives of every type provided for by it have 
been established: Day schools, including general industrial schools, 
technical high schools and high-school courses, part-time coopera- 
tive industrial courses for apprentices actually employed, and schools 
and courses for instruction in the fine and applied arts; and night 
schools distinctively for adult workers. The needs of the war have 
brought special emphasis to bear upon the instruction for appren- 
tices. Public-spirited employers in some places have offered tangible 
inducements to attend classes :in mechanical drawing and shop mathe- 
matics, and in one instance managers allow one month to be deducted 
from the year’s apprenticeship for a faithful winter’s work in night- 
school classes upon these subjects. War needs have also brought to 
the front the value of classes for women in domestic science. 
But perhaps the greatest progress in industrial and technical 
education has been made in the development of the day schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
reaching as these do boys and girls under 14 who can not be given 
such training in the public schools, and who have not the maturity 
of mind to do successful night-school work. This branch of educa- 
tion has also received great stimulus from the attendance of re- 
turned soldiers in trade and technical classes, this having been 
affected by arrangements with the Dominion agencies already men- 
tioned, which used the already established courses for the re-educa- 
tion of disabled soldiers. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 
Mention has been made of the disappointment felt in certain quar- 
ters over the failure of the continuation schools, as originally con- 
templated, to develop agricultural instruction as its chief feature in 
rural schools. According to the report of the inspector of elemen- 
tary agricultural classes, this type of instruction has steadily over- 
come difficulties, and wherever it has been established as a regular 
subject of the public-school curriculum it has maintained itself and 
steadily grown in public favor. Perhaps the most conspicuous proof 
of the part agricultural education is coming to play in the Province 
is seen in the school fair exhibits held in the rural districts, and 
serving by means of the appeal to local productions, interests, and 
the awarding of prizes for excellence along agricultural lines, to 
arouse and maintain a social solidarity unknown until their introduc- 
tion. By regulation school fairs are formally organized under the 
direct charge of the district representative of the department of 
agriculture of the county in cooperation with the public school inspec- 
tor. According to the report of the supervisor of district repre- 
sentatives: ? 
The special features in many places are the live-stock judging competitions, 
for teams of three boys from each school, who are asked to judge two classes of 
live stock, generally beef or dairy cattle and heavy horses; the public-speaking 
contests in which from 2 to 10 boys and girls compete; the boys’ and girls’ driving 
contests, which include rapidity and skill in hitching and unhitching; the school 
fair parades ; physical drill under the Strathcona trust; weed and apple naming 
contests, and the exhibition of calves and colts by boys who had spent con- 
siderable time training their pet animals. 
The call made each spring for increased food production, issued by 
the ministers or superintendents of public instruction throughout the 
Dominion, resulted in Ontario as elsewhere in a tremendous stimulus 
to formal instruction in agriculture. A large number of the schools 
undertook school garden work for the first time with very gratifying 
results. By ministerial regulation the duties of inspectors were still 
further increased in the promotion of agriculture, horticulture, and 
manual training and domestic science especially adapted to the 
requirements of farm life, and it was made the duty of each public  
-P-A-G-E-157
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 157 
and separate school inspector to inspect half-yearly the teaching of 
agriculture and horticulture in the schools of his inspectorate, and 
to make a special report thereon to the minister and the school boards. 
By the regulation of 1918, special grants were offered to school 
boards and teachers of lower and middle schools for satisfactory 
work in agriculture and horticulture, and to rural and village schools 
for classes maintained in manual training as applied to the work of 
the farm or in household science suitable to the requirement of rural 
districts, where a qualified teacher is employed, and accommodations, 
equipment, and a course of study approved by the minister are 
provided. 
MANITOBA, 
DEMOCRATIC METHODS. 
The transition is abrupt from the close centralization of the public 
school system of Ontario to the thoroughly democratic system of 
Manitoba. Each is the outcome of peculiar social and political con- 
ditions. In Manitoba, as in the adjacent sister Provinces of Sas- 
katchewan and Alberta, conditions of life are largely rural, and they 
have fashioned educational machinery to their own liking. The ynity 
of the interests of these three Provinces is so generally recognized that 
in May, 1918, their ministers and deputy ministers met at Calgary, 
in Alberta, adopted uniform textbooks in most of the public and high 
school courses, and provided for a training course for teachers of 
the first and second class certificate which should be 33 weeks in 
length, the completion of grades 11 and 12 being prerequisite to 
admission to it. 
Contrary to the municipal unit, which is the basis in the Provinces 
to the eastward, the unit of educational organization in Manitoba 
is the school district, ranging in area from 16 to 25 square miles, 
with the legal provision by which the district can be organized with 
10 school children. The several district and municipal boards have 
absolute power in the financial support and physical upkeep of the 
schools and in the selection of teachers, subject only to the general 
supervision of the ministry of public instruction. Remarkable elas- 
ticity in administration is secured by the provision of the public- 
school act by which a municipal school board may be established in 
any municipality where the electors so desire. In addition, any 
rural council may, and on petition of 15 per cent of the electors shall, 
submit a by-law at any municipal election for the purpose of ascer- 
taining the wishes of the people in the matter, upon the passing of 
which law trustees are elected who are required to take over the whole 
matter of administration of the schools, the original school districts 
being dissolved, and the new board possessing all the powers pro- 
vided in the act for boards of rural school trustees,  
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
An important feature of the latter is the appointment of an official 
trustee to take charge of school districts which can not be satisfac- 
torily managed by a regular board of school trustees. This system 
has been attended with marked success; and in the work of organiza- 
tion and management the services of the official trustee have in many 
cases proved invaluable. The trustees in their turn have combined 
during the past two years in provincial and local associations, open- 
ing the way to united action along many lines and securing a broad 
attitude toward educational problems which would otherwise have 
been impossible or at least long delayed. The activities of the 
official trustees have been especially commended by the inspectors of 
the districts. The Manitoba Educational Association has recognized 
the great part they play and has created a special section known as 
the trustees section of the association. 
THE ADVISORY BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
On the academic and scholastic sides a unique feature in the sys- 
tems of the western Provinces is the advisory board of education. 
In Manitoba this organization dates from 1890, and is regarded by 
the people of the Province as having furthered the progress in edu- 
cation more largely than any other agency. With its activities it has 
grown in membership from 7 to 31, one-third of whom in 1916 had 
served in various departments of practical educational work, and the 
remainder represented agriculture, the industries, and the profes- 
sions. The board touches practical education most closely in the 
following respects: 
1. It grants to teachers professional certificates, and has steadily 
raised the requirements therefor, culminating in the regulation ef- 
fective July 1, 1916, which etyadnae candidates for normal school 
teacher training to have completed three years of high-school work, 
thus making the scholastic preparation of teachers identical with 
that required for entrance to other professional schools; by regula- 
tion of 1917 it decreed that no permanent license should be granted 
any teacher who is not a British subject by birth or naturalization, 
all others being allowed only an ad interim certificate valid for not 
more than six months, renewable for no longer period and requiring 
a special oath; it further discontinued the authorization of school 
texts for bilingual teaching in the public schools. 
2. The board has charge of the courses of study of the public 
schools of all grades, and has steadily made more rigorous the com- 
bined course of study first adopted in 1918, which constituted a great 
step toward unifying educational interests in the Province by satis- 
fying the requirements of both the University Council and the Nor- 
mal School.

CONSOLIDATION. 
The most conspicuous feature of education in the western Provinces 
is the consolidation of rural schools at convenient centers, a measure 
practically unknown in the eastern Provinces of the Dominion, but 
of very rapid growth in the Provinces which are under the educa- 
tional influence of the States of the American Union. The advan- 
tages incident to the consolidation of schools have from the first been 
thoroughly appreciated in Manitoba; more and better teachers, mod- 
ern and hygienic buildings, possibilities of the beautifying of school 
grounds, largely increased enrollment, and in many places the at- 
tendance of practically all children of compulsory school age, instead 
of the deadening disadvantages of a number of inaccessible single- 
room schools. In 1917 eighty consolidations were in operation in 
Manitoba, covering a territory of one-tenth of the entire organized 
school area, 
Progress in the improvement of the health and sanitary conditions 
of the rural schools continues through the— 
organized campaign in which the Provincial Board of Health and the Depart- 
ment of Education are cooperating. In 1917 the board of health decided to 
employ a staff of expert nurses to operate in the rural districts, In all cases 
there has been harmonious and effective cooperation between teachers and 
nurses. * * * In 1917 sixteen rural schools undertook to provide hot 
lunches of some sort, and the people look upon it favorably and the trustees 
give assistance in equipment and materials. 
ATTENDANCE, 
The problem of school attendance is always one that looms large 
in education in rural sections. Manitoba has had for some years 
a legal supervisor of school attendance; and by a succession of acts 
respecting school attendance, culminating in the one of May, 1917, 
it has sought to improve the attendance on the elementary schools, 
though with the reluctance of a democratic people to prescribe gen- 
eral laws it has refrained from passing any provincial compulsory 
school attendance law. The last act provides for the appointment 
by school boards or municipal councils of a school attendance officer 
or officers, and sets forth their duties as well as those of school 
trustees, parents, guardians, teachers, and inspectors under the act, 
prescribing suitable penalties. The act has social as well as educa- 
tional import in its purpose of protecting children from neglect 
and of securing for them the benefit of an education. Attendance 
officers to the number of nearly 150 were appointed within the year 
following the passage of the act. 
TEACHERS. 
A large part of the credit for the vigor and the growth of the 
schools of the western Provinces is due to the unusual personnel
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
of the teachers of the public schools. This is especially true of 
Manitoba. Here, as in the neighboring Provinces, the teachers are 
better paid than in the East, and they fill a larger place in the life 
of the people outside the schoolroom. As a consequence, there is 
every year a powerful draft upon the teaching force of the older 
Provinces. In the summer of 1918 an unprecedented demand was 
made upon the teachers of Manitoba by the Provinces still farther 
to the west, as shown by the publication of columns of advertise- 
ments, “ Teachers wanted,” appearing in the papers for perhaps the 
first time in the history of the Province. The greatest unrest ever 
seen in that body of course followed. y 
HIGH SCHOOLS, 
As would be expected in a Province so progressive as Manitoba, 
the program of studies of the high schools has been under close 
scrutiny; and the Manitoba Educational Association has devoted 
much study to its reorganization and improvement. With the out- 
break of the war the need was felt for a readjustment of studies. 
The time required in foreign languages necessary for admission to 
the university was considered disproportionate, and the high-school 
committee attempted an arrangement of courses to give a fair pro- 
portion of time to each important subject. The university was there- 
fore asked to lower its language requirement from two foreign 
languages to one. After many conferences, the university council 
declined to grant the request. The issue is of course the one familiar 
in many countries under various names but with the same funda- 
mental problem of dispensing with the study of Latin. Of interest, 
too, in its bearing upon the preparation for the high school, as well 
as upon the number of pupils sent into it, is the tendency to unite the 
two highest elementary grades.into one for convenience of teach- 
ing where teacher shortage is felt. It has been tested in various 
localities but has not commended itself in actual practice unless, as 
has been suggested, Grade VIII could be stiffened and the secondary 
school begun with it. 
THE UNIVERSITY. 
An interesting experiment was initiated in 1918 by the University 
of Manitoba, preliminary to its establishment of a department of 
commercial education. Representatives were sent to the cities and 
towns of the Province to survey the possibilities offered for students 
in that branch, to analyze business conditions, local and general, and 
to examine methods of taxation and systems of licenses imposed by 
the various towns and municipalities. The report is awaited with 
great interest, as promising valuable information not only educa- 
tionally but economically and legally,  
-P-A-G-E-161
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 161 
The farthest reaching piece of legislation relative to higher edu- 
cation in the Dominion was enacted in 1917 by the assembly of 
Manitoba on the basis of the bill submitted by the minister of edu- 
cation, remodeling the constitution of the University of Manitobz, 
providing for a board of governors of nine members vested with full 
power over the financial affairs of the university and the final 
decision of all matters of academic policy; for a university council of 
27 members, a few more than one-third of the number of the old 
council, vested with general charge of courses and academic work; 
and for representation of the denominational colleges of the Province 
upon the council alone. Upon the appointment by the Government 
of the chancellor and the installation of the administrative authori- 
ties, the reorganized institution began a vigorous career, with the 
enthusiastic support of all the educational elements of the Province. 
SASKATCHEWAN. 
The democratic ideas just described in the case of Manitoba are 
even more pronounced in the Province just to the west, Saskatche- 
wan; but centralization more akin to that of the eastern Provinces 
has asserted itself in the public-school system of the latter. This 
centralization, however, has not lessened the deep popular interest 
in the schools. Perhaps the most convincing proof of this was the 
educational survey of the Province decreed by order in council 
and undertaken during the latter half of the year 1917. The public 
had been favorably prepared for this survey by the activities of 
the Public Education League, which had launched public meetings 
and led up to the proclamation of a public holiday by the premier, 
on which the needs of educational reform were emphasized at rallies 
held at a number of points. All this time there had been no lapse 
in public interest in education, as is shown by the fact that, since 
the organization of provincial government for Saskatchewan’ in 
1905, school districts had been organized at the extraordinary rate 
of one a day. 
With the tremendous increase in the amount of; routine’ work 
thus devolving upon the department of education, serious discus- 
sion arose as to whether the school unit with a board of three trus- 
tees was not too small, and whether the organization of boards of 
seven members, as for the municipalities, would not be better able 
to handle a much larger territory organized as a municipality. 
The matter is as yet unsettled, but indications are that an organic 
change will be brought about by the stirring of public interest. 
The progressive nature of the people and of the schools of 
Saskatchewan was well brought out in the findings of the survey 
to which reference has been made. The strongly centralized system, 
171030°—21—Bull. 89 ——11
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
it was agreed, had been of great service in the early primitive days; 
but the findings bore out the belief that a system more adapted to a 
largely increased population and especially one giving considera- 
tion to local needs was now required. In the survey, as published 
in 1918, Dr. H. W. Foght, Director, thus summarized what he re- 
garded as the determining factors in the system: 
(1) The people of the Province have failed to use the schools as fully as they 
should have done, 
(2) The pevailing system of school organization and administration in 
rural districts particularly is no longer adequate for modern uses. 
(3) Abnormal opportunities in other occupations and other causes have con- 
spired to make it difficult to train and keep in the profession an adequate num- 
ber of well-prepared teachers. 
(4) The courses of study in elementary and secondary schools do not in all 
respects meet the demands of a democratic people occupied with the conquest 
of a great agricultural country. 
(5) The schools, in their internal organization, are planned less for the 
normal child than for the exceptional child, and offer slight opportunity for 
individual aptness and initiative. 
(6) The system of examinations in use is a questionable test of the average 
pupil’s scholarship, ability, maturity, and fitness for advancement. 
(7) Bodily health and hygienic conditions in schools, so essential to effective 
study, have received little attention in the daily teaching, and are largely dis- 
regarded in the physical equipment of the schools. 
(8) The schools, while liberally maintained, must receive even eee sup- 
port in order that commensurate returns may be obtained on the school in- 
vestment. 
THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ACT. 
The School Attendance Act, which came into effect May 1, 1917, at 
once increased the enrollment and regularity of attendance of school 
children falling within the compulsory age from 7 to 14 years. By 
its provisions town districts appoint attendance officers who report to 
the department of education every month. In village and rural dis- 
tricts such duties are fulfilled by the teachers. As regards territories 
covered by the school act and length of school year, every town and 
village district, and every rural district with at least 12 children 
of compulsory age resident within 14 miles from the schoolhouse, 
shall offer at least 210 teaching days; and every district with at least 
10 children of compulsory age shall offer at least 190 days. A most 
important phase of the act is that it provides for keeping systematic 
records of the population of compulsory age, which has hitherto not 
been legally required. 
School consolidation is also involved with provisions for attend- 
ance, an amendment to the act just mentioned made in 1917 giving 
the minister of education power at discretion to allow a larger area 
than 50 square miles to be included in the district served by consoli- 
dated schools, Very significantly, Saskatchewan has fallen far
-P-A-G-E-163
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 168 
below its sister Provinces of Manitoba and Alberta in the progress 
shown in consolidation, though considerations of climate and to- 
pography made consolidation as necessary and as feasible as in either 
of the other two Provinces. 
Dr. Foght, in his summary, concludes that: 
Consolidation has made little progress in Saskatchewan because no provincial 
policy has yet been adopted extending Government grants and guidance to 
proposed consolidation districts. A belief that Saskatchewan is not yet ready 
for consolidation may have caused Government officials not to push the matter. 
No concerted policy has yet been adopted by the Government to encourage 
some particular form of consolidation. The 18 consolidations now in operation 
are due mainly to local initiative. 
SHORT-TERM SCHOOLS, 
Another unfavorable phase is the existence of the so-called “short- 
term school,” by which are meant rural schools opening in April or 
May and continuing from five to eight months. Such an arrange- 
ment plainly represents a compromise which, whatever may have 
been its original justification, has brought seriously grave disad- 
vantages in its train. These schools engage a new teacher each year 
and often change teachers two or even three times in the year. In 
many cases they can only obtain “ permit” teachers because qualified 
teachers prefer schools that are in operation throughout the year. 
On this point the minister of education concludes: 
The consequence is that the children in these schools are backward in their 
studies, with thousands growing up who have never got beyond Grade IV, 
and unless action is taken at once these conditions will continue with the 
present generation poorly equipped for life’s tasks. 
INSTRUCTION IN AGRICULTURE, 
As agriculture is the predominant industry of the Province, prac- 
tically all interest in vocational and technical education for the past 
two years has centered in the furthering of agricultural education. 
The agricultural instruction committee in 1917 made the following 
recommendations to the Department of Education which, while 
they have not as yet become part of the official regulations, are prac- 
tically certain to be adopted at an early date: 
1. That agriculture and elementary science be compulsory for Third Class 
Part II of the teachers’ course. 
2. That household science be an optional subject with music or manual train- 
ing for Third Class Part II of the teachers’ course. 
8. That agriculture and general science be compulsory subjects for examina- 
tion instead of physics and chemistry for the second class teachers’ diploma. 
4, That an annual maximum grant of $500 be made to such high schools as: 
give adequate instruction in the course in agriculture as defined from time
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
to time in the regulations of the department, the amount of such grant to be 
based upon the qualifications of the teachers, the nature of the equipment, and 
the efficiency of the teaching as reported upon by the inspector of high schools. 
Aside from the formal instruction in agriculture, a large part is 
played by the Rural Education Associations organized in the various 
districts and municipalities with the cooperation of inspectors and 
the general public. Such interest has been aroused in this movement 
that more than 40 local associations were organized during the year 
1917. They promote popular interest in education by means of school 
fairs, at which exhibits along all lines of country life are shown. 
TEACHERS. 
As in Manitoba, the personnel of the teachers of Saskatchewan is 
drawn largely from outside the Province, Ontario furnishing in 
1916 more than 30 per cent and Manitoba 28 per cent of the total. 
The number of young teachers is unusual, one-third of the rural 
teachers being below 21 years and over half ranging from 20 to 25 
years. In both of these facts grave disadvantages are evident. The 
present facilities to train teachers within the Province are entirely 
inadequate, and many hundred schools must be filled with provisional 
teachers, while very many others are below 21 years of age but hold 
permanent certificates. In the high schools, however, while the 
teachers are comparatively young, the average age being 32, the 
average of training and experience is unusually high. As Dr. Foght 
says: 
This combination of youthfulness and experience constitutes a very real asset 
for education in the Province, especially in view of the movement for better 
integration of the high schools and the grades, which will demand men and 
women who know intimately both elementary and secondary education. 
In the field of health promotion Saskatchewan has made a forward 
step in the organization of a division of the Department of Educa- 
tion in charge of a director of school hygiene. A vigorous campaign 
for the conservation and promotion of health has been initiated and 
a survey made of hygienic conditions in the rural schools. 
ALBERTA, 
In Alberta educational progress for the past two years has been 
steady, in spite of distracting conditions due to the war. Nat- 
urally, a falling off was seen in the average attendance of pupils, 
though an increase was seen in the case of girls. The secondary 
schools suffered from enlistment of the larger boys for overseas 
service; and for purposes of increased production large numbers of 
boys, and in some cases girls, were permitted to assist in farming 
operations, the school-attendance act being less rigorously enforced. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  iz EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 165 
The changed conditions brought about ‘a different method of 
classification between graded and ungraded schools. Hitherto 
ungraded has meant rural, but many rural school districts now 
conduct graded schools, and as rural schools are more and more 
consolidated they pass from the list of ungraded to that of graded 
schools. 
A further interesting effect of the change is seen in the fact 
that the enrollment of pupils in the secondary grades is increasing 
much more rapidly than the total enrollment in the lower schools 
of the Province, the increase being from less than 3 per cent in 1906 
to nearly 6 per cent in 1916. Noteworthy also in its bearing upon 
the schools is the evidence of greater prosperity in the rural com- 
munities than in the town and village districts; this is shown by 
the fact that more than two-thirds of the money borrowed by 
school’ authorities according to the system of legal debentures was 
for the rural school districts. The distinctive feature of the finan- 
cial support of the schools of Alberta is constituted by the legally 
organized school debenture branch, under a manager appointed by 
the Premier, a very important part of whose work is to supervise 
school-building plans, contracts, and initial orders for equipment, to 
prescribe modern requirements of lighting, heating, and ventilation, 
and to approve all financial engagements made by local boards. 
To it is largely due the credit of having made Alberta, the newest of 
the western Provinces, widely known for the uniform excellence 
of its school buildings. 
THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ACT. 
Most important of the administrative acts pertaining to the 
schools was the passage of the amended and much strengthened 
School Attendance Act in 1916, which took the place of the old 
“Truancy” act, whose name and some of whose provisions had be- 
come distasteful. Attendance officers under this act in the cities 
and larger towns are responsible for its enforcement. In the rural 
and village districts enforcement is by means of a school attendance 
branch and the school inspectors, who are ex officio provincial at- 
tendance officers. In cases of unjustifiable nonattendance the new 
law provides that officials, after exhausting tactful measures with re- 
calcitrant parents or guardians, issue legal warning notices, serving 
them like other legal papers and allowing 10 days to elapse before 
the application of the law. Teachers also are required to carry out 
the provisions of the act especially by the inclusion of information 
bearing upon nonattendance in their monthly attendance reports. 
A serious difficulty was found, however, in the laxity with which 
Jocal authorities excused attendance on various exceptions outlined
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 3 
in the act, especially that stating that “the parent, guardian, or 
other person shall not be liable to any penalty imposed by this act 
in respect to the child if the child has attained the full aga of 14 
years and is regularly employed during school hours in some useful 
occupation.” Under this head, owing to the scarcity of farm labor, 
a great many boys missed the schooling which they should have 
had. Many inspectors, however, considering the harvesting and 
marketing of crops important as war measures, did not bring legal 
pressure to bear, being convinced that such nonattendance was 
a matter of necessity and not of neglect. 
CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS. 
Consolidation of rural schools has proceeded steadily in Alberta, 
contributing also, by the wisdom of a number of inspectors, to the 
furthering of vocational and rural secondary education. This was 
initiated by a very progressive prevocational survey made by the 
Department of Education with a view of reaching primarily the 
country youth in their teens. To this end recommendations were 
made for distinctively rural schools in which a high-school course 
of two or three years, and closely adapted to local needs and condi- 
tions, should have the most prominent place. 
THE BILINGUAL SITUATION. 
The bilingual situation in Alberta has been discussed in connec- 
tion with that topic, as it applies to the Dominion of Canada. As 
regards the setting of this problem in the school system and adminis- 
tration of the Province, attention should again be called to the fact 
that Alberta alone has a special supervisor of schools for foreigners. 
This officer has been of the utmost advantage and usefulness in in- 
structing trustees, both lay and official, in their duties of putting 
and keeping the schools of foreigners in operation; in supervising 
the affairs of the districts; in harmonizing internal dissensions; in 
securing qualified teachers; in building teachers’ houses in many 
places, and in general lending aid to the boards in remote localities, 
and in the management of financial affairs. A large part is also 
played by this official in spreading among the alien population ele- 
mentary ideas of sanitation and correct methods of living, which 
connects vitally with the projected system of medical inspection 
throughout the Province, which is likely to be made compulsory 
within a short time. 
TEACHERS’ CODE OF HONOR. 
An interesting proof of the progressiveness of the teaching force 
of Alberta is furnished by the action (1918) of the Alberta Teachers’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN CANADA. 167 
Alliance in promulgating the following code of honor for the guid- 
ance of the body: 
It shall be considered an unprofessional act— 
1. To disregard the validity of a formal contract with the school board. 
2. To criticize adversely, except in an official capacity, the efficiency of a 
fellow member of the alliance. 
3. To pass along rumors derogatory to a fellow member of the alliance, 
whether such rumors be based on fact or not. 
4, To seek professional advancement by any other than professional means. 
5. To seek employment with the school board (a) not in good standing with 
the alliance, (b) already having a member of the alliance under contract for 
the same position. ; 
6. To make known to nonmembers, except through authorized channels, the 
proceedings of a committee or general meeting of the alliance. 
BRITISH COLUMBIA, 
Educational interest in British Columbia has centered during the 
past two years in the extension of the work of the high schools in 
such a way that the varied needs of different communities may be 
served; in so developing the work of the rural high schools as te 
adjust them to the life of agricultural communities, and especially to 
attract the farm boy into the high schools and there train him defi- 
nitely in agricultural science; in providing nonprofessional training 
for teachers in elementary as well as high schools; in spreading the 
appreciation of the need of physical exercises and organized play- 
ground sports; in effecting important changes in the high-school 
examinations whereby in cities of the first and second class exam- 
inations were waived and pupils were promoted to high schools on 
the recommendation of their principal, and second-year high-school 
pupils were promoted on that of their teachers. 
On the strictly administrative side, amendments were made to the 
public schools act of 1916 for the transition of assisted schools to the 
status of regularly organized school districts, for defining city school 
districts of various classes, for apportioning per capita grants of 
various amounts for cities of the various classes and for rural school 
districts, and for paying bonuses upon the salaries of teachers in the 
rural districts. Perhaps most noteworthy is the provision by which— 
where it appears that in any school district there are 20 or more persons 
of the age of 14 years and upwards desirous of obtaining instruction in techni- 
eal education, manual training, domestic science, commercial training, or in 
the ordinary branches of an English education, the board of school trustees 
may establish, under regulations issued by the council of public instruction, 
night schools for their benefit.

  168 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF JAMAICA. 
By CHartes BH. Aspury, 
American Consul, Port Antonio, Jamaica. 
ORGANIZATION. 
Jamaica is an-island in the West Indies, and a British colony, with 
a population by the last census of 831,000, of whom over 95 per cent 
are of African descent, either in whole or in part. Fifty-three per 
cent of the population can read and write. In 1916-17 the average 
attendance at school was 62,000, or 1 of 12 population. With a 
total expenditure by the Government of $6,000,000, only $420,000, or 
7 per cent, was spent for public education. This amounts to $6.75 
per head of average attendance and 55 cents per capita of population. 
The facilities for public instruction in Jamaica consist of public 
elementary schools in the towns and villages throughout the island, 
with a few private secondary schools in the chief centers. There are 
training schools for teachers which give advanced elementary in- 
struction, but there is no college in the colony. 
The schools are administered under a board of education for the 
colony, at the head of which is the director of education. The direc- 
tor has on his staff 11 inspectors, who are usually men from English 
universities. The Department of Education allots the funds appro- 
priated for educational purposes, and exercises advisory supervision 
over all the schools of the island. The governor in privy council re- 
tains final authority in all matters of educational legislation. 
A large majority of the public elementary schools are owned and 
managed by the various Protestant churches, and receive financial 
aid from the Government. At the last report there were 696 public 
elementary schools, of which the churches owned 566, the Govern- 
ment 111, and other organizations 19. The Department of Education 
maintains its control over the schools through its power of granting 
or withholding financial support. 
Each parish has its school board, and the schools in certain por- 
tions of the island have been grouped under district boards. These 
boards, however, have only such powers and duties as the depart- 
ment may delegate to them, the immediate control of each school rest- 
ing in the hands of a manager, who represents the owners. The 
manager is advised by a local board, but he has authority to make 
final decisions, employ teachers, provide equipment, and inspect the 
~ schools, and in most ways, he actually directs the policy of the school.
-P-A-G-E-169
  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF JAMAICA. 169 
GRANTS, SUBSIDIES, ETC. 
The appropriations for education are distributed among the schools 
by the department through an elaborate system of “ grants,” paid to 
the school managers in monthly installments. An average attend- 
ance of 30 or more is necessary to secure a grant. The amount of the 
grant is determined by the average attendance and the “marks” or 
rating given the school at a formal annual inspection. A perfect 
rating consists of 84 marks. If the average attendance is 60 or 
mere, a grant is made of $4.86 for each mark. If less than 60, $3.65 
is granted for each mark, and 2 cents in addition for each unit of 
average attendance. If the average is over 50 but under 70, an ad- 
ditional $1.45 is paid for each unit of attendance above 50. If the 
average is over 70, $2.90 is paid for each surplus unit of attendance, 
in addition to the $1.45 for the units from 50 to 70. All these grants 
are to be applied to the salaries of the teachers. Additional small 
grants are made for teaching industrial subjects. 
The départment makes limited grants to assist in erecting or re- 
pairing school buildings and teachers’ cottages. In no case can this 
grant exceed $486 for a school, or $243 for a cottage, or one-half the 
total cost of the project. The average annual grant for buildings is 
approximately $2,500. The building must be located on at least 
one-fourth acre, and must be occupied as a public school or teachers’ 
dwelling for at least 12 years after the grant is made. All school 
sites and building plans must have the department’s approval. 
Where a Government school is located in a building owned entirely 
by private persons, a nominal yearly rental of 36 cents is granted 
for each unit of average attendance. There are also small grants 
for supplies, library books, sewing materials, sanitation, garden 
fences, etc. These amount to only a few cents per unit of average 
attendance. 
TEACHERS. 
All teachers in the public schools are registered by the department, 
and are classified on the basis of training and rank in examination. 
They must be 18 years of age or over, and must have had at least 
one year in a teachers’ training school or have passed the third year 
pupil-teacher’s examination. Teachers are classified as “ principal 
teachers” if they are judged qualified to take charge of a school; 
as “assistant teachers” if not so qualified. The advancement of 
teachers depends upon their success in school and in examination, 
and the length of their experience. Certificates are issued upon a 
successful examination in the second or third year’s course at a train- 
ing school. <A principal teacher who has taught for 12 years, with 
inspection grade of “first class” for at least six years, is given a
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  170 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
“ good service” certificate which has an important bearing upon the 
teacher’s salary. A few teachers are registered as qualified for 
kindergarten work. They are required to have special training, and 
aspiring teachers are afforded an opportunity to secure this training, 
partly at Government expense. 
Each school may employ, in addition to the regular teachers 
described above, one or more pupil teachers. They must be between 
the ages of 14 and 17, and are required to pass an examination. They 
must execute a three years’ contract, and are paid a small wage. 
Pupil teachers are entitled to receive three hours’ extra instruction 
per week from the principal teacher, outside of school hours. Upon 
passing an examination after three years’ service as a pupil teacher, 
the candidate is entitled to registration as an assistant teacher, and 
is eligible for employment. A few pupils who have completed the 
elementary course and are unable to continue their education in a 
private secondary school are allowed to attend the elementary schools 
and act as monitors, with the privilege of attending the pupil- 
teachers’ classes. 
The training schools for teachers continue the essentially English 
idea of education—a matter of private initiative and Government 
subsidy. Any school with proper equipment which follows an ap- 
proved course of study may seek recognition as a training school for 
teachers. Some of the requirements are the pupil-teachers’s exami- 
nation for entrance, his being of the minimum age of 17 years, and 
pursuing a three years’ course, and the maintenance of an elementary 
practice school, which in turn may be a “ Government grant ” school. 
To each recognized training school the Government makes a grant 
of $120 per year for the board and instruction of each regularly 
admitted student, with a bonus of $50 for each one that passes the 
annual examination, provided that the total grant does not exceed 
four-fifths of the total cost of maintaining the school. Religious 
interest or philanthropy is expected to supply the remainder. 
Before students are admitted to the training schools, they must make 
an agreement, supported by a bond, to teach for six years in the 
Jamaica schools. For each year of failure to fulfill this promise, 
the student becomes liable to the Government for the sixth part of 
the cost of his training. 
The training school scheme has not been found a great success. 
The Government has been compelled to establish two training schools 
of its own, in addition to the subsidized ones, in order to keep up the 
supply of teachers. There are at present about 500 certified teachers 
in the colony, with 114 students in the training schools run by the 
Government, and 26 in the schools under subsidy. 
In the training schools, as in all other Jamaican schools, the course 
of study is determined by the subjects on the final examination.  
-P-A-G-E-171
  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF JAMAICA. 171 
These examinations are given at the close of each year’s work, and 
include the following subjects: Reading and recitation, writing, Eng- 
lish, arithmetic, algebra, school management, scripture and morals, 
geography, history, science—general and agricultural, physiology 
and hygiene, geometry, vocal music, drawing, and manual training 
for men, or domestic science for women. <A grade of 50 per cent is 
required for passing in the first six subjects, and 33 per cent in the 
others. In addition to the regular training course, a brief agri- 
cultural, technical, or kindergarten course may be given and the 
attendance of teachers permitted or required, with a portion of their 
expenses borne by the Government. 
The salaries of teachers are at ‘present determined by the system 
of grants and marks mentioned above, based upon the rating of 
their school at the annual inspection. A radical change in the 
system was made recently, to go into effect April 1, 1919. Hereafter 
the determining factor is to be the average attendance of the 
school, with the teacher’s rank and success record taken into consid- 
eration. The present minimum of $90 per year for assistant teachers 
will be retained, but salaries will average about $200 per annum, 
with a maximum of $875 for the head masters of the larger schools. 
All extra grants and bonuses will be discontinued. This change 
has been suspended, however, owing to lack of funds to put it into 
operation. 
Teachers are employed by the manager of the school under writ- 
ten contract, subject to the approval of the ‘department. The con- 
tract may be terminated at any time by either party after three 
months’ notice, and every vacancy must be advertised. 
SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
All superintending is in the hands of the 11 inspectors attached 
to the Department of Education. They receive salaries of from 
$730 to $1,215 per annum, with traveling expenses. Provision has 
recently been made for raising the pay of inspectors to $972 and 
$1,458, and creating two new positions of “chief inspector,” with 
salaries of from $1,458 to $1,700. The intention is to appoint only 
graduates of English universities to these positions. 
Every school in Jamaica which receives Government grants and 
offers an elementary course of instruction is a public elementary 
school. All pupils may attend who care to do so, provided they are 
eligible under the law and accommodations are adequate. No tui- 
tion may be charged. New schools are established upon application 
to the board of education, which in turn submits the proposition 
to every minister of religion within a radius of 4 miles from the 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  172 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
proposed location. If the department decides that the school is 
necessary, and that all requirements have been met, it may grant 
a lump sum for. the first. year and permit the school to be opened. 
Schools must be in session four days per week, mornings and 
afternoons, and in certain towns one-half day in addition. Each 
day’s session lasts five hours. A minimum of 28 half-day sessions 
per month and 288 per annum is required. Holiday periods must 
be approved by the department, and usually: differ widely in the 
several schools. 
The board of education has authority to make attendance at 
school compulsory, but so far the law has been made effective only 
in three towns of the island. The president of the Jamaica Teachers’ 
Union states that there are from eighty to ninety thousand children 
in the island who do not attend school. The question of extending 
the compulsory attendance law over the entire island is being con- 
stantly agitated, but it is improbable that any change will be made 
under the present economic conditions. Objection is also made to 
the provision of law which compels a pupil to withdraw from school 
at 14. Unless he has completed the elementary course by that time, 
he is deprived of any further opportunity to do so. 
The teacher is required to keep an elaborate set of records, includ- 
ing admission book, register of attendance, log book, stock book of 
materials, account book, pupil-teachers’ record book, and garden 
book. The log book is very interesting. It is a sort of diary of the 
school, in which is recorded day by day every event of importance. 
It also contains the record and recommendations of the annual 
inspections. Before a teacher may administer corporal punishment, 
he must be authorized to do so by the manager, and the authority 
must be written out in the log book. 
CURRICULUM AND COURSES. 
The curriculum of the public elementary school is based entirely 
upon the subjects for examination at the annual inspection, and the 
entire time and attendance of teacher and scholars are devoted to 
preparation for that event. The inspection lasts only one day, and 
in that time the inspector examines all the pupils on the whole cur- 
viculum and determines the rank of the school and the standing of 
the teacher. The highest rank attainable is “84 marks,” distributed 
as follows: Organization, 6; discipline, 6; reading and recitation, 15; 
writing and English composition, 15; arithmetic, mental and writ- 
ten, 15; elementary science, especially agricultural, 8; Scripture and 
morals, 5; drawing and manual occupations, 6; geography with 
incidental history, 4; singing and drill, 4; total, 84. A school which 
attains 56 marks or more, with a grade of not less than two-thirds of
-P-A-G-E-173
    PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF JAMAICA. 173 
the possible marks in the fundamental subjects and one-third in the 
others, is ranked as of the first class. Others rank second or third 
class according to their marks. f 
The elementary course is graded into seven standards, each sup- 
posed to represent one year’s work of a normal child. The lowest 
standard is called the “junior,” and the others are numbered con- 
secutively from Ito VI. The work of the sixth standard is not essen- 
tial for entrance to a secondary school, and is given only in the larger 
schools corresponding to our “graded” schools. In the smaller 
schools the standards are grouped into three divisions, lower, middle, 
and upper, with arrangements for covering all the course by a system 
of two courses of study to be given in alternate years. 
It would appear from the list of studies that the curriculum is 
much the same as that of the average American school. The instruc- 
tion, however, is radically different. There is much more emphasis 
in the Jamaica school upon the purely mechanical exercises, such as 
reciting memorized poems, writing from dictation, drawing and 
penmanship. There is an almost total absence of quiet seat work and 
study. The first impression of a Jamaica school room is likely to 
be one of hopeless confusion. Each of the three divisions may be 
reciting at the same time, to the teacher, the assistant, and a pupil- 
teacher. It is remarkable what good results are obtained, however, 
in some schools. i 
Some difficulty has been experienced in the matter of religious 
instruction. Since the various churches own so many of the schools, 
they have insisted upon Bible teaching and the catechism in the cur- 
riculum. In order to meet the situation, the study of Scripture and 
morals is included, but teachers are enjoined from commenting except 
in the way of pointing out an obvious and universally recognized 
lesson. In addition, a conscience clause has been enacted by which 
pupils who so desire are excused from school during the Scripture 
hour, which must be at the beginning or close of a session. 
INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNICAL TRAINING. 
Some real progress has been made in industrial instruction, but 
the work is greatly handicapped for lack of funds and of competent 
instructors. A Government technical school was established in 
Kingston in 1896. Here pupils from the Kingston elementary 
schools receive instruction in manual training and household indus- 
tries. The school also conducts continuation evening classes for 
both sexes. The work is purely elementary, and its limited scope 
is indicated by the fact that the head master is also the manual train- 
ing instructor of the principal teachers’ college and organization 
inspector of manual training for the whole island, having direct
-P-A-G-E-174
174 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
supervision over all the manual training work. There are six ad- 
ditional teachers for day classes and six for the continuation school. 
Provision is made for regular work in manual training, gardening, 
and “housewifery” in other schools where suitable teachers and 
equipment can be obtained. The manual training course is for the 
boys of the upper division and consists ,entirely of mechanical 
drawing and simple woodwork. Small grants are made by the Gov- 
ernment for teachers and tools. 
There are about 400 school gardens in the island, but the ada ue- 
tion in agriculture is very rudimentary. The department requires 
a plat of not less than one-tenth acre, and assists in the construction 
of a fence and the purchase of tools. A small grant is also made to 
the teacher for garden instruction. All the pupils work in the 
garden, the boys by requirement and the girls by permission. ‘The 
aim seems to be to use the plat chiefly for experimental purposes and 
for demonstration, rather than for practical crop results. 
All schools are required to teach plain sewing to the girls, and a 
few which have met the requirements as to equipment receive Gov- 
ernment aid for the teaching of cooking and laundering. There 
are a very few schools where practical domestic science is taught, 
but they are chiefly private secondary institutions. There is even 
in Jarhaica a touch of the feeling that work is degrading and unbe- 
coming a scholar, and industrial work has been hampered accord- 
ingly. 
Nothing has been done in Jamaica in the way of supervised play- 
grounds. There is a little drill work occasionally, but the children 
play their own games in a half-hearted way. The effect is plainly 
seen in the poor physique of the children, and the absence of the 
wholesome democratic spirit which free, healthy play so much en- 
courages. 
SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
Secondary instruction has been left largely to private initiative 
and facilities are consequently limited. The Department of Educa- 
tion exercises some jurisdiction over the private secondary schools, 
however, and is gradually extending its control. Scholarships are 
provided from public funds to the total amount of $1,360 annually 
for deserving pupils who desire to continue their education above 
the elementary course. These scholarships pay the hollers from $50 
to $120 annually for two years. They are distributed by competi- 
tive examination to applicants who must be under 12 years of age. 
Holders are expected to pass the Cambridge secondary examin- 
ations in order to retain their places. These examinations were 
introduced in the colony in 1882 by the Jamaica Institute, a semi- 
public institution. In 1916 there were 471 candidates for the several 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 178 
grades of the examinations, of whom 60 per cent were successful. 
The scope of these examinations largely determines the curriculum 
of the secondary schools. They cover Latin, French, algebra and 
geometry, English history, geography, English composition, gram- 
mar and literature, and Scripture. The scope of each examination is 
announced in advance, and the year’s work is arranged especially to 
meet the examination requirements. 
The only secondary technical instruction offered by the Govern- 
ment is in the form of trade scholarships to winners of a competitive 
examination who agree to apprentice themselves to a master work- 
man in their chosen trade for a period of years. During the first two 
years of the apprenticeship, the students are given instruction in 
the Kingston Technical School at the expense of the Government. 
A grant is made to cover the cost of their board and clothes during 
the apprenticeship, and to provide them with kits of tools when 
they complete it. The maximum number of students provided for 
at any one time is 25. 
Legislative provision has been made for grants to continuation 
schools for working boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 17, 
but so far Kingston is the only community to take advantage of it, 
The law provides for a course of 26 weeks of 35 hours per week, with 
instruction in English, arithmetic, Scripture, and home economics, 
manual training, or agriculture. A movement is on foot to obtain 
more substantial Government aid for these schools so that the crying 
need for elementary instruction for the boys and girls above 14 may 
be met. 
There is a healthful dissatisfaction with the present system among 
the progressive element, which promises to become strong enough 
ultimately to secure good schools, adequately equipped, with strong 
emphasis on industrial and vocational education.

GENERAL FEATURES. 
The Commonwealth of Australia comprises the States of New 
South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Aus- 
tralia, and Tasmania. Each State has developed its own system of 
education, controlled and supported by the State authorities. Pri- 
mary education is free in all the States and secondary education is 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
free in some. Compulsory school attendance in most of the States is 
from 6 to 14; in New South Wales the compulsory period begins at 7. 
Every effort is made by the State authorities to reach the children 
in the sparsely settled centers. For this purpose the State establishes 
central schools in such localities where the children can be conven- 
iently conveyed to school free of charge, or provisional schools, i. e., 
small schools in which the attendance does not exceed 8 or 10. When 
the number of school children does not warrant the establishment of 
a provisional school, half-time schools are formed, the teacher visit- 
ing these schools on alternate days. In some places the teacher goes 
from house to house. In 1908 New South Wales inaugurated a 
“traveling” school, the teacher being provided with a tent for him- 
self and one to be used as a school. Two additional schools of the 
same kind have since been established. Other States have made 
similar arrangements. Often the State grants subsidies to a teacher 
engaged by two or more families; the teacher must, however, be 
officially recognized by the Department of Education. In localities 
where no facilities can be found for either schoolroom accommoda- 
tion or board and lodging for a teacher, the children are reached by 
correspondence. This scheme seems to bring best results in homes 
where the parents or elder sisters or brothers can assist the young 
beginner. It has been successfully introduced in New South Wales, 
Victoria, and Tasmania. In Victoria the system was developed from 
the Teachers’ College, and 120 isolated children were thus taught in 
June, 1917. 
Education in the Commonwealth is on the whole homogeneous. 
As each State developed independently, minor differences arose in 
the course of years. To make the work of the various departments 
more uniform and for the purpose of coordinating the school systems 
in the different States, the first conference of Australian directors 
of education was held in Adelaide in July, 1916. 
According to the ministerial report the following resolutions were 
passed : 
« 1, AGRECULTURAL EDUCATION. 
* 
(a) That nature-study work be developed with a view to increasing its use- 
fulness and making it of practical benefit to the children. 
(bo) That agricultural education be developed and carefully organized. 
(c) That suitable schools be established in rural centers, so as to give, in 
addition to higher primary work, a direct practical training in subjects 
specially useful to rural workers; e. g., for boys—woodwork, metal work, 
blacksmithing, simple building construction, land measurement, and agriculture ; 
for girls—cookery, laundry, dairying, and smaller farming industries. 
(d) That for the largest centers of population agricultural schools be estab- 
lished for city boys who have completed the primary course and who desire to « 
follow agricultural pursuits; such schools to act as feeders to the ba 
colleges. }
-P-A-G-E-177
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 177 
(e) That it is desirable that some method be adopted to coordinate the work 
of the various State authorities, dealing with various phases of agricultural 
education. ‘ 
2. CONTINUATION PERIOD OF EDUCATION. 
1. That as far as practicable provision should be made for the continuous 
education of boys and girls beyond the primary standard of instruction, and 
that this education should include both a specific training for citizenship and 
courses of instruction preparatory for various classes of future occupations. 
2. That legislation is desirable to provide for such continued education, both 
full time and part time, in daylight hours; and, further, to provide that it be 
obligatory upon all boys up to the age of 16 to receive such continued education, 
either whole time or part time, where facilities for the purpose are provided. 
8. That while facilities for similar continued education should be made 
available for girls, their attendance for the present should rest on a voluntary 
basis. 
3. INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION. 
1. That instruction in craftsmanship be in two grades: 
(@) Preparatory—To be given in full-time day schools in continuation of the 
primary-school course, and that the courses of such schools include such in- 
struction combined with hand training as will provide a preparation for more 
specialized trade training. 
(b) Technical schools for instruction of persons (i) Actually engaged in a 
skilled trade, in order to supplement by school instruction the training gained 
in the practice of the trade; (ii) But it is desirable that instruction in such 
schools be arranged in daylight hours. 
2. That the State and Commonwealth Governments be invited to give a 
lead to other employers by requiring the attendance of their young employees, 
during working hours, at suitable technical classes. 
4, COMMERCIAL EDUCATION, 
1. That in view of conditions likely to prevail after the war, attention be 
given to the provision of commercial education. 
2. That provision be made in the courses of study of secondary schools of 
both lower and higher type for a commercial group of subjects in those States 
in which this provision has not already been made. 
3. That for those who have left school and have entered upon commercial 
callings, suitable evening courses in the State educational establishments be 
instituted, and arrangements be made by which these courses shall lead up to 
the university school of commerce. 
4. That arrangements be made whereby one or two universities should pro- 
vide the instruction on some reciprocal plan to be determined upon by consul- 
tation among all universities of the Commonwealth. 
Of interest are the resolutions with regard to arrangements for 
education in adjoining States of children living in border States. 
These read : 
(a) That children living on the borders of a State be given every facility 
for attending school in the neighboring State if there is no school near them 
in their own State. 
* (b) That the department, when dealing with questions of establishment of 
new schools on the borders of States, take into consideration the total number 
of children in the district on each side of the border. 
171030°—21—Bull, 8912
-P-A-G-E-178
    178 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
(c) That there is no need for any financial adjustment in respect to this ar- 
rangement, as the benefits to the States are fairly equally divided. — 
(d) That a review of the border schools be made as soon as practicable, with 
a view to improving existing conditions. | 
The conference also passed a resolution that the school certificate 
of one State be recognized by another State, and finally that “there 
be cooperation between the States in the matter of training of 
specialist teachers.” 
WORKERS’ TUTORIAL CLASSES. 
An interesting development in the education of the working circles 
is the inauguration of the Workers’ Tutorial Classes, an organiza- 
tion somewhat akin to the extension lectures. The scheme was 
launched in 1913 in connection with the formation of the Workers’ 
Educational Association. 
The Workers’ Tutorial Classes exist at present in all the States. 
Although controlled by the university, they receive Government 
grants (except in Western Australia) ranging from $1,500 in Vic- 
toria to $25,000 in New South Wales. The aim of these classes is 
to bring the university into closer relation with the working men. 
The principal subjects offered are industrial history, economics, po- 
litical science, and sociology. The entire course extends over three 
years. The students’ reading is supplemented by class discussions, 
and by writing an essay on subjects dealing with some phase of 
economics, civics, and sociology. 
Tutorial classes have been formed at the universities as well as in 
suburban and country centers. 
GERMAN SCHOOLS IN AUSTRALIA, 
A number of private schools were conducted by German teachers 
in several States of the Commonwealth prior to the war. Jn South 
Australia 52 schools were under the control of the Lutheran Church, 
and the language of instruction was exclusively German. The edu- 
cation act of 1915 provided that teaching in these schools should be 
through the medium of English for at least four hours a day. The 
education amendment act of 1916 modified this law to the effect that 
the Government should take over all the Lutheran schools and that 
no language but English should be spoken in the schools. The use 
of German as the language of instruction is prohibited in all the 
States of the Commonwealth.. 
TRAINING OF RETURNED SOLDIERS. 
The Department of Repatriation has been created in the Common- . 
wealth for the purpose of replacing the returned soldiers in civil 
life. An officer of the department meets the transports at the port  
-P-A-G-E-179
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 179 
of disembarkation and places before the men the facilities provided 
by the State. It has been proposed to provide workshops in leather 
work, basket-making, raffia work, and toy making for the convales- 
cent men who are still in hospital. The proposed workshops are to 
be under the control of the military authorities. 
The Department of Education in each State offers free tuition 
to returned men in all the technical colleges; responsibility of find- 
ing employment for those who had finished their training rests with 
the Government. 
THE TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The training of teachers received considerable attention on the 
part of educational authorities. With the institution by the States 
of a wider high-school system and greater facilities for the study 
of the subjects relating to education at the universities a marked 
improvement was effected in the training of teachers. In recent 
years definite progress in that direction was made in the States of 
Victoria and Tasmania. 
In Tasmania the new scheme of teachers’ training, put into opera- 
tion in January, 1918, lengthens the minimum period of training 
from 15 weeks to 6 months and adds new requirements for the junior 
public examination. The new scheme provides four distinct courses 
according to the nature of the work which the applicant is to under- 
take. 
(a) A short course which aims to prepare teachers for provisional 
schools and the less important positions in the primary schools. It 
extends over six months. 
(6) Infant course designed for prospective teachers in infant and 
kindergarten schools. The course extends over one year. 
(c) Primary course designed to train teachers for the primary 
schools. The students must have completed two years of professional 
training in a State high school and have qualified for matriculation 
before entering the training college. The course extends over one 
year. 
(d) Secondary course designed to train teachers for the secondary 
schools. It is open to promising students who have satisfactorily 
completed the primary course. The length of study is one to two 
years, in addition to the year spent in the primary course. 
Before appointment the prospective teachers enter into agreement 
with the school authorities to serve the department for a certain 
length of time, which varies from two to five years, according to the 
expense and length of the course they have pursued. 
A similar scheme for the training of teachers was put into opera- 
tion somewhat earlier in Victoria. Instead of one course, leading to 
the trained teachers’ certificate, four courses have been provided, 
namely, a secondary, a primary, an infant, and a short course for
-P-A-G-E-180
    _ 180 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
teachers of small rural schools. Under a correspondence system rural 
teachers may receive further instruction by corresponding with the 
Melbourne High School. Similar arrangements are also made at 
the Teachers’ College for country teachers who are studying for an 
infant teacher’s certificate. 
The training of teachers has been further greatly promoted by the 
courses on education recently introduced in some of the Australian 
universities; for instance, a lectureship on education has been in- 
augurated at the university of Tasmania. At the university of 
Western Australia education may be offered as a subject for a degree 
in arts; arrangements have also been made for a postgraduate di- 
ploma of education. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION, 
The spread of technical education continues in all the States of the 
Commonwealth. In recent years noteworthy measures for the pur- 
pose of reorganizing the technical schools have been taken in New 
South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania. 
In New South Wales a scheme was evolved whereby the system of 
the workshop was coordinated with that of the technical school and 
college. Two main courses of instruction have been established: (a) 
Trade courses for apprentices and (6) higher courses for students 
desiring to pursue their studies in the various trades and professions. 
An important feature in the new scheme is the regulation regard- 
ing admission. No student is admitted to any course unless evidence 
is furnished that he possesses sufficient preparatory knowledge to 
benefit by the training. An exception is made in the higher diploma 
course in science, which is open to students irrespective of occupa- 
tion. The trades courses are divided into two parts; the lower 
courses, covering a period of three years in the trades schools, and 
the higher, extending over two years in the technical colleges. A 
trade school leaving certificate admits the student without further 
examination to a technical college and thence to the university. The 
primary technical school is.thus linked with the highest institution 
of learning. 
' In 1916 there were three technical colleges in the main industrial 
centers, and 10 trades schools in suburban and country districts; 
classes in elementary technical instruction were held in various 
smaller localities. 
The measures regarding apprenticeship inaugurated in , New 
South Wales in 1914 were introduced a few years later in South 
Australia. The technical education of apprentices act, passed by 
the legislature in 1917, provides for the appointment of an appren- 
tices advisory board, with the view of changing the whole system 
of apprenticeship. The chief provision of the act requires that

each indentured apprentice, during the first three years of his ap- 
prenticeship, may be compelled to attend suitable technical classes 
for six hours per week for 40 weeks per year. Four of these hours 
shall be during the working hours and two in the evening. 
In Zasmania a commission was appointed in 1916 for the purpose 
of developing technical education, and bringing the existing tech- 
nical schools. into proper relation with the primary and secondary 
schools. 
As a result of the commission’s recommendations a technical 
branch: in charge of the organizing inspector was created in the 
Department of Education. Technical schools were reorganized and 
classified according to their courses as junior or senior technical 
schools. 
The junior technical schools aim to give prevocational training in 
industrial, commercial, and domestic subjects. The course extends 
over either two or three years and is free. The senior technical 
schools provide vocational training in industrial, commercial, art, 
and home-making subjects. The length of the courses varies from 
two to five years. Plans have been made for the opening of four 
junior technical schools in the immediate future. 
Progress in technical education has also been made in Victoria, 
where seven junior technical schools were opened recently. In 
Queensland the first trade preparatory classes were inaugurated. in 
1917 and progress was so gratifying that the scheme will undoubt- 
edly lead to the establishment of a comprehensive system of appren- 
ticeship. 
An interesting feature of the technical education is the setting 
up of advisory committees consisting of representatives nominated 
by employers’ and employees’ associations. These committees are 
formed for each subject or group of subjects offered in the technical 
schools. The duty of the advisory committees is to visit classes and 
inspect the work of the students. They may also advise on the 
scope and detail of the syllabus. 
The following special features developed in recent years in the 
various States are of interest: 
NEW SOUTH WALES, 
Public instruction (amendment) act, 1916.—This act contains im- 
portant provisions regarding compulsory school attendance, the cer- 
. tification of private schools, and the inspection of school premises. 
Compulsory school attendance is provided for children between the 
ages of 7 and 14, the lower age limit being raised from 6 to 7. 
Exemption is granted to children receiving instruction at home on 
at least 85 days in each half year. To comply with the new regu- 
wy
-P-A-G-E-182
182 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
lations children must be sent to schools certified by the department 
as efficient. Hitherto the department exercised no supervision over 
private schools except those that applied for registration under the 
bursary endowment act. This act, passed by the Parliament in 1912, 
provides bursaries for students in public or private secondary 
schools and in the University of Sydney. Private schools desiring 
the benefit under the act must register and comply. with the de- 
partment regulations with regard to premises, the organization and 
equipment of the school, the method and range of instruction, and 
efficiency of the teaching staff. Fees in the primary schools were 
abolished in 1906, in high schools in 1911. Since 1916 textbooks 
and materials have been provided free. In recent years great prog- 
ress has been made in secondary education. The number of high 
schools has increased from 5 in 1910 to 22 (including 3 interme- 
diate) in 1916; the average quarterly enrollment has risen from 894. 
to 5,830, and the cost per scholar from about $35 to $105. 
Higher education is fostered by a system of public exhibitions 
which include the cost of matriculation, tuition, and degree fees. To 
cover the increased cost of the exhibitions the statutory endowment 
fund was increased by £10,000 per annum under the provisions of the 
amending act of 1916. By the same act £2,000 were assigned for the 
establishment of a chair of architecture at the University of Sydney. 
The Government aid received by the University of Sydney during 
the year 1916 amounted to £54,592. The teaching staff consisted of 23 
professors, 7 assistant professors, and 122 lecturers and demon- 
strators. There were also on the university staff 8 honorary lecturers 
and demonstrators. The number of students attending lectures dur- 
ing 1916 was 1,660, including 500 women. 
VICTORIA, 
Education of women.—The Council of Public Education, appointed 
to advisé on educational matters, submitted in its report for 1917-18 
the following data on education of women. The council pointed out 
that in view of the fact that compulsory education ends at 14, and 
girls are not permitted to work in a factory until the age of 15, much 
valuable time is wasted. The council proposes, therefore, to extend 
compulsory education of girls until the age of 15. It suggests that 
during the impressionable years of the girl’s life she should be taught 
in special schools by women teachers. The curriculum in these 
schools should embrace cultural as well as practical subjects. The 
subjects proposed by the committee include English, mathematics, 
geography, history and civics, hygiene, and music, also instruction in 
simple cookery, needlework, and laundry work. Practical work 
should not occupy more than one-third of the time during the first
-P-A-G-E-183
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 183 
year, but should be extended to one-half of the time during the final 
year. f 
As regards secondary education the council found that “ at present 
the course of work followed is very largely determined by prescribed 
entrance examinations to the university.” This should be changed. 
Instead of a prescribed course of study, alternative courses should 
be instituted for girls who do not contemplate a university course. 
Courses in art and music should be introduced in the school curric- 
ulum and given the same credit as those in literature and mathe- 
matics, 
The general practice in the secondary school—with boys as well as girls—is 
to look upon art as something like an excrescence; it is dubbed an “ extra,” 
and is not considered worthy of a recognized place in the curriculum. This 
should be corrected. 
The girl who leaves the primary school, and, more particularly, the older 
girl who leaves the secondary school, should do so with, at least, the beginnings 
of a cultivated taste. Mere literacy studies, however important, will not do 
this. The critical artistic faculty need cultivation as well, and as much as any 
other. Study should not stop short at the ability to express form and color, 
put should, by the application of form and color to decoration and design, and 
its expression in dress, architecture, and furniture, cultivate an appreciation 
of tasteful and appropriate surroundings—matters that are far too important 
to be left to the tender mercies of the dressmaker or the furniture ware- 
houseman,. Liking and disliking should have a basis in knowledge and culture, 
and not in ignorant whim and caprice. 
Industrial training for women should be greatly extended. Junior 
technical schools for girls desiring to enter the industrial field 
should be preparatory to the courses in technical schools which in 
Victoria are open to women. Greater facilities should also be 
afforded to girls who wish to enter upon a commercial career. 
Finally, the council lays stress on the moral and physical education 
which should be cultivated in girls’ schools on a larger scale. 
QUEENSLAND. 
Vocational education came under the control of the Government 
in 1908 and has since been steadily growing. Among the most 
recent developments are the opening of a trade school for apprentices 
and the extension of instruction in domestic science and agricul- 
ture. In 1917 a scheme was launched to provide classes in domestic 
science in the sparsely populated centers. This is done by means 
of itinerant teachers. The traveling instructors are provided with 
portable structures which are used when erected as domestic science 
classes. The course is outlined for the period of six months. 
A report on agricultural education in Queensland was issued in 
1917 by a special investigating committee appointed by the under- 
secretary of public instruction. The committee advocated the in- 
troduction of agricultural education along the following lines:
-P-A-G-E-184
184 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Agriculture should be a matter for the State rather than the indi- 
vidual. In primary schools gardening and tree planting on a small 
scale should be encouraged, also nature study and observation. More 
rural schools with an elementary program on agriculture should be 
opened by the Government. In secondary schools provision should 
be made for the study of agricultural subjects. These schools should 
lead directly to agricultural colleges, which in turn should be 
affiliated with the university. A department of agriculture under 
the faculty of science was also recommended. 
The first rural school was opened in Queensland in January, 1917. 
The curriculum is practical. It is designed to equip the boys and 
girls with knowledge suited to the requirements of those who live 
on the land. 
Agricultural instruction has also been introduced by the depart- 
ment in the primary schools, where milk and cream testing is a part 
of the curriculum. ‘ 
WESTERN AUSTRALIA. 
In Western Australia every effort is made to reach the children in 
the sparsely populated areas. Until recently a full time Government 
school was established in any locality where a regular attendance of 
not less than 10 children between the ages of 6 and 14 was assured. 
If the attendance fell below, the school was closed. The parents 
were then urged to engage a private instructor, the Department of 
Education sharing the expenses. The new regulation, issued in 1916, 
increases the school facilities by providing that the average attend- 
ance for a period of six months must fall below eight before the 
school can be closed. The report of the Education Department for 
1917 shows that 646 primary schools were in operation during that 
year. Of these, 85 new schools were opened in 1917, 11, which 
had previously been closed, were reopened, and 7 were closed during 
the year. Of the 646 schools, 341 had an average attendance be- 
low 20. | 
The practice of the department can be readily understood when it 
is borne in mind that the population of the State consists of 320,000 
inhabitants scattered over an area of about 1,000,000 square miles. 
The problem of the small country schools in Western Australia is 
very pressing. 
Endeavors are being made by the school authorities to bring the 
country child in closer touch with his surrounding. Courses in ele- 
mentary science have been recently introduced in these schools, and 
experiments in the growing of vegetables, culture of flowers, and 
the elementary agriculture carried on in the school gardens. The 
teachers receive much assistance by way of departmental publica- 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
  EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 185 
tions and outlines in lessons dealing with the elements of agricul- 
tural science. In this work the Department of Education is greatly 
assisted by the agricultural department of the university and by 
the commissioner of agriculture. The training college is also devot- 
ing special attention to the work of prospective teachers in small 
country districts. 
From time to time short courses for teachers extending over 2 
fortnight are held in centers where the neighboring teachers can 
easily attend these lectures. The courses are conducted by school 
inspectors. 
District high schools have been recently established in several 
localities. In addition to the general subjects, the curriculum pro- 
vides for a science course with direct bearing upon agriculture. The 
high schools are not free, but a system of scholarships enables prom- 
ising country children to avail themselves of a secondary education. 
SOUTH AUSTRALIA. 
School committees——A new departure in the school system in this 
State is the inauguration of school committees. These committees, 
represented by the parents of the pupils, take a personal interest in 
the school of their district. Extensive improvements have been thus 
introduced. Although the school committees have no voice in school 
administration, they render valuable assistance in other matters per- 
taining to school. Classrooms have been decorated with proper pic- 
tures, libraries stocked with suitable books, school premises kept in 
proper shape, and trees planted on school grounds; not infrequently 
parents and teachers come together and a meeting is arranged for 
the purpose of discussing the various needs of their school. Com- 
menting on the work of the committees, the director of eduéation 
says: 
The substitution of school committees in place of boards of advice marks a 
distinct educational advance. A committee, having only its own school to 
care for, acquires a sense of ownership, with corresponding interest. 
In many places money has been raised atid expended on improvements. Quite 
a number of schools have been supplied with pianos in this way. Altogether, 
thousands of pounds have been saved to the State by good citizens who have 
determined that their school, at any rate, shall not be in need of the help that 
they can give. 
Valuable as this is, I regard as of even greater importance the development 
of public spirit and personal interest—our school, no longer the school. 
By and by, perhaps, we shall have this interest so extended that no parent 
will pass the school without looking in and looking on for a few minutes. The 
parent has as much interest in the school as has the scholar, since upon it 
depends much of the future of the child. He should know what is being taught, 
and how.

NEW ZEALAND. 
INTRODUCTION. 
The war had seemingly little effect on the progress of education in 
New Zealand. Although 650 primary-school teachers were in active 
service at the beginning of 1917, and there were hardly any physically 
fit men teachers left in the entire school system, the minister of 
education says in his report for 1916 that “not only have the various 
administrative, educational, and social agencies of the department 
been kept up to the regular standard of efficiency, but a substantial 
amount of progress has been made, which even in normal. times 
would justly be regarded with satisfaction.” 
Among the notable changes the report mentions the following: 
The raising of the standard of requirements for the certificate of 
proficiency; the granting of free places in technical schools for 
holders of certificates of competency (the latter certificates were 
issued to pupils who were unable to obtain the higher certificate of 
proficiency, but who showed special aptitude in manual subjects) ; 
the inauguration of a grading scheme for the classification of teach- 
ers; the extension of medical inspection; and a more liberal allowance 
for kindergarten schools. 
According to the latest report of the minister of education the 
number of public schools in 1917 was 2,368, with an average attend- 
ance of 168,711, as against 2,855 in 1916, with an average attendance 
of 163,156. 
The total expenditure of the Department of Education for the year 
1917-18 was £1,809,187, an increase of £119,480 over the expenditure 
for the previous year. Of the total expenditure, 75 per cent was on 
primary education, 12 per cent on secondary education (including 
technical high schools), 4 per cent on university education, 3 per 
cent on industrial and special schools, 4 per cent on technical edu- 
cation, and 2 per cent on teachers’ superannuation and miscellaneous 
charges. 
RETARDATION OF PUPILS. 
The question of retardation of pupils received a great deal of 
attention. Statistics show that the average percentage of retarda- 
tion in standards 1 to 6, inclusive, is 19; the highest percentage is 
24 in standard 3. The causes of this retardation are delayed school 
entrance, mental or physical defects of pupils, and transfer of pupils 
from one school to another. For the purpose of reducing this wast- 
age of time, special classes for the care of backward children are to 
be established in all large schools. It is hoped that a number of 
children receiving special training for a longer or shorter period will 
make greater progress and ultimately join the classes with normal 
classification. 
   
-P-A-G-E-187
EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 187 
Of all pupils entering standard 1, only 59 per cent finish the pri- 
mary course, and 41 per cent never reach standard 6. To enable the 
latter to receive some kind of industrial education a more elastic 
scheme of admission to technical schools was devised and put into 
operation at the end of the year 1917. According to the new regula- 
tions, pupils over 14 years of age who have left the public schools 
not more than six months previously without obtaining a graduation 
certificate may, on the recommendation of the school inspector, enter 
a free technical school. The pupils thus admitted must select sub- 
jects bearing upon a trade or industry, including agriculture and 
domestic science. They must not take any commercial subjects. Com- 
pulsory continued education is at present provided only at the option 
of the local authorities in some 17 small areas, but steps are taken 
to have it organized in the Dominion on a more comprehensive 
national basis. At the third general meeting, held in June, 1917, by 
the council of education, an advisory body on the matter of education, 
it was resolved “that it should be compulsory for every child be- 
tween the ages of 14 and 17 years living within 3 miles of technical 
classes to attend such for three hours a week and 30 weeks a year.” 
In compliance with this regulation of 1917, three more centers were 
opened for continued education of the youth. 
CHILD WELFARE. 
The health of school children is carefully guarded by a system of 
medical inspection and physical instruction which the Department 
of Education is vigorously pursuing. Medical inspectors do not 
treat, but examine, the children. In case defects are found, the 
parents are notified and urged to attend to the matter. If necessary, 
the school nurse visits the homes of the pupils and sees that satis- 
factory results are obtained. Medical inspectors render further 
assistance by delivering lectures to parents on such topics as diet, 
clothing, and the treatment of simple ailments. Lectures and 
demonstrations by medical inspectors are also regularly given to the 
prospective teachers in the training colleges and to instructors already 
in the service. 
The work of physical instruction is now carried on in practically 
all the schools. Weak and defective children requiring special exer- 
cises are treated separately in so-called corrective classes. Great 
progress in the children’s health has also been made in recent years 
by providing fresh-air schools for normal pupils. 
Nor is the health of infants, i. e., children below 6 years of age, 
neglected. For some years New Zealand has registered the lowest 
percentage of infantile mortality for the entire world. This result 
   
-P-A-G-E-188
  188 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
is due to the splendid system of infant life protection conducted by 
the Department of Edfication and by private persons, the “Society 
for the Promotion of Health of Women and Children,” founded in 
1907 under the encouragement of Gov. and Lady Plunket. District 
agents and duly qualified nurses under the department visit the 
homes where children under 6 years of age are taken care of by their 
foster parents. In case the conditions surrounding the child in the 
foster home are found unsatisfactory, the license may be revoked and 
the child may be directed for care to some other place. More 
elaborate is the educational campaign conducted by the “Society for 
the Promotion of Health of Women and Children” and carried on 
by the so-called “Plunket nurses.” These nurses are concentrated 
in some 70 points of the Dominion and visit both near-by centers 
and more remote districts in order to lend counsel and impart in- 
struction in all that pertains to the hygiene of motherhood and 
the care of children. The services of the nurses, or, better, the 
specialists in child care, are at the call of any member of the com- 
munity, rich or poor. Their duties are not properly covered by the 
term “nurses,” as their fundamental aim is of an educational nature. 
Whenever a community expects the arrival of one of these nurses, the 
members of the local committee, who have been officially notitied, 
make necessary arrangements for the visitor to speak at various 
gatherings of mothers and to hold public demonstrations relative 
to the care of children in addition to informal conferences in the 
local school and the instructional visits to the individual homes. An 
integral part of her duties also consists of correspondence with 
mothers who live in districts too remote to allow systematic visitation. 
Thus the society concerns itself less with reducing the infantile 
death rate than with jealously safeguarding the health of children. 
NATIVE SCHOOLS. 
The Government supports a number of schools for the natives. At 
the end of 1917 there were in operation 118 native villageschools at- 
tended by 4,622 Maori children. A large percentage of the Maori 
children also attend general public schools. A number of secondary 
schools for Maori children, under control of denominational bodies, 
are subsidized by the Government, which provides free places for 
the native children. According to reports of the minister of educa- 
tion the progress in education made by these children compares fav- 
orably with the school record of children of European parents. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
With regard to secondary education, it is to be noted that of 9,517 
pupils who in 1916 left the primary schools after having passed 
standard 6, 5,489 children, or 58 per cent, entered a secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
EDUCATION IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. 189 
institution. Unfortunately, few finish the course. The average 
length of stay is two years and nine months for boys, and two years . 
and eight months for girls. 
The types of school that provide secondary education are: Sec- 
ondary schools, technical high schools, district high schools, private 
secondary schools, and Maori secondary schools. 
There are no definite regulations governing the curriculum of 
secondary schools. These schools are mainly governed by the sylla- 
buses of the various public examinations and by regulations issued 
by the Government with regard to the instruction of pupils holding 
free places. According to new regulations issued in 1917, all junior 
pupils holding free places in secondary schools must “ receive instruc- 
tion in history and civics preparatory to a course in the elementary 
principles of economics to be taken at a later stage.” In the new 
regulations provision is also made for instruction in home science, 
cookery, laundry work, needlework, and home nursing for girls, and 
practical agriculture and dairy science or some other vocational 
subjects for boys. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Technical education is gaining more ground in the Dominion, 
judging by the increased attendance of students at the technical 
schools. Irrespective of enrollment of older students, the total num- 
ber receiving instruction at all the schools and technical classes was 
20,747, an increase of 1,056 over the previous year. Increased demand 
is made for classes in engineering and agricultural subjects. In a 
number of centers classes for farmers were conducted on subjects 
bearing directly on agricultural and dairying industries. These were 
well attended. There was also an increase in the number of classes 
bearing on various trades and occupations. At 22 centers 167 dis- 
“charged soldiers received free tuition in technical schools. In a 
number of cases where the technical school lacked the necessary 
equipment and workshops the school cooperated with the local firms 
which provided proper facilities for discharged soldiers. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The New Zealand University is an examining body, with four 
affiliated teaching colleges: Auckland University College, Victoria 
University College, Canterbury College, and the Otago University. 
The New Zealand University is a Federal institution with limited 
powers. It can not interfere with the internal affairs of the colleges 
which are administered by the various councils. Each of the colleges 
specializes in certain directions; Auckland University College in min- 
ing and commerce, Victoria in law and science, Canterbury College in
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  190 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
engineering and science, and Otago University in pgshomctce: and 
dentistry. 
The number of students in attendance at the four doflegedt in 1917 
was 1,902—1,007 men and 895 women. This is a slight increase over 
the preceding year. As to the selection of courses, the majority, 
i. e., 44 per cent, took the arts course, 15 per cent studied medicine, 
11 per cent engineering, 10 per cent law, and the rest took various 
other courses. 
The total staff of the four colleges consisted in 1917 of 49 pro- 
fessors, 50 lecturers, and 32 assistants, demonstrators, etc. 
With regard to new developments worth noting is the establish- 
ment of a school of architecture at the Auckland University and a 
course of instruction in anthropology at the University of Otago. 
In general the significance of ethnological studies is being more and 
more recognized by representative scientists, who urge that the New 
Zealand University should encourage this branch of learning by 
recognizing it in her examinations and by providing properly quali- 
fied teachers. 
The New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology, 1918, vol. 1, 
No. 5, says editorially : 
Neglect of ethnological studies is greatly to be regretted for both individual 
and national reasons—individually because a knowledge of the main results 
of ethnological and anthropological research is a necessity for the understand- 
ing of civilized as well as of uncivilized man. The decay of custom is a long 
process, requiring many centuries. Thus the habits of thought of Yorkshire 
villages are still influenced by Scandinavian mythology. There is no section of 
the community more in need of such knowledge than ministers of religion, but, 
unfortunately, it does not yet form an essential part of their training. 
Nationally such studies are of far-reaching importance, because of the geo- 
graphical position of New Zealand. We have in our midst a race backward in 
civilization—the Maori—and still bound by ancient custom of thought in spite 
of a veneer of alien culture. The proper treatment of the many problems thus 
involved is impossible without a knowledge of ethnology, and of the Maori 
people themselves, on the part of the legislators and electors. The probable 
absorption of the Maoris in the people of the North Island will produce a type 
differing from that in the South Island, and it is desirable that this problem 
should be properly envisaged by our thinkers. 
Any future expansion of New Zealand in the Pacific islands will bring further 
problems, for all of which ethnological knowledge will be necessary. Those 
who are directly concerned in the administration of these islands should above 
all receive such a training. New Zealand must play a part of some kind during 
the next five hundred years in the solution of the color problem—the relations 
between black, yellow, and white peoples. If it is to be a worthy part, there 
must be an increase of ethnological studies. This does not me: that a new 
subject should be introduced into the syllabus of the primary sna secondary 
schools, for it would even now be possible for a teacher with the necessary 
knowledge to introduce very interesting and educative lessons on ethnology 
into the geography course. But a prior necessity is the waning teachers to 
a higher standard, and a beginning should therefore be made in the university.
-P-A-G-E-191

Extensive revision has also been made of the courses of study at the 
Otago University School of Mines. The period of studies in min- 
ing, metallurgy, and geology has been lengthened from three to four 
years, of which the first three years of study are common to all three 
divisions and specialization occurs in the fourth. By this means a 
greater amount of general and especially geological training is given 
to students of all divisions, while additional advanced courses have 
been ‘introduced in mining, metallurgy, and workshop practice. 
In addition to the class work, all students must spend 12 months 
in practical work, the length of the vacation being arranged so as 
to permit the student to complete this work by the time the class 
work is finished. All students must spend at least four months in 
underground mining work, while an additional eight months must be 
spent in mining, metallurgical work, or in geological surveying, and 
a thesis prepared descriptive of some mining operations, a metallur- 
gical process, or the geology of an approved area according to the 
division in which the student specializes. 
SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. 
The importance of scientific research for the advancement of in- 
dustrial efficiency has been realized in New Zealand, as in other parts 
of the British Empire, in the early days of the war. An attempt to 
coordinate science and industry was made as early as 1915, when 
several scientific and other bodies in New Zealand had been consid- 
ering in what manner scientific and industrial research might be or- 
ganized in the Dominion. The matter received, however, no official 
consideration until some time later, when at the request of the acting 
prime minister, the national efficiency board, in coordination with sev- 
eral other scientific bodies, evolved a scheme which was forwarded 
to the Government in January, 1918. 
Some of the provisions of the proposed scheme are: 
1. There should be established a board of science and industry, 
with responsible functions and substantial authority to encourage 
and coordinate scientific and industrial research in the Dominion. 
2. There should be a minister of science and industry, who should 
be the chairman of the board. 
8. An adequate sum, not less than £100,000, should be voted by. 
Parliament to cover the expenditures for five years. 
The board is also to have power to establish, award, and supervise 
fellowships and to see that the fellowship, tenable for two years, 
should be of sufficient value to prevent the holders from being at- 
tracted to other positions. 
It was also suggested that the board of science and industry might 
(a) advise primary producers upon all questions of the application of
-P-A-G-E-192
  
  ) 
192 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
science to their industries; (b) advise persons, firms, or companies 
engaged in industrial pursuits as to improvements in the arts and 
processes employed, and as to the utilization of waste products; (c¢) 
make recommendations as to the adoption in an industry of the 
results of investigations conducted under its direction; (d) under- 
take the investigation of industrial problems which, if unsolved, 
would obstruct the development of the industries concerned; (e) 
advise the Government in regard to the help that should be given to 
any new industry that is likely to be ultimately of value to the 
country, though at first it may not be workable except at a loss; (/) 
advise the Government as to which contribution, if any, should be 
made toward the cost of any research by the firms or companies bene- 
fited thereby; (7) on the request of the University of New Zealand, 
consult with that body in matters relating to the national research

AFRICA.

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. 
The Union, constituted by an act of Parliament in 1909, comprises 
the former self-governing colonies, the Cape of Good Hope, Natal, 
the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony, known at present as 
the Orange Free State. The executive power is vested in the gov- 
ernor general, appointed by the British sovereign, and a cabinet of 
ministers, the members of which are chosen by the governor. Each 
Province is administered by a provincial council, with power to deal 
with elementary and secondary education. Higher education, in 
accordance with the act, is placed under the control of the minister 
of education for the Union. 
The system of education maintained in the four Provinces is con- 
cerned primarily with the children of white parents. The education 
of the natives, who form the bulk of the population, remains in
-P-A-G-E-193
  EDUCATION IN THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA. 193 
the hands of the missionaries, who maintain their own mission 
schools. The Government exercises some control over these schools 
and gives its financial support in the form of grants-in-aid. In 
all the Provinces education was made compulsory for the children 
of European extraction. No such provision exists for the children 
of other races. In some of the Provinces the tendency to increase 
educational facilities and to raise the compulsory age of the pupils 
has, in recent years, received official sanction by direct legislative 
measures. 
So, for instance,*at the Cape of Good Hope one of the most im- 
portant features of the year 1917 was the amendment relating to 
compulsory school attendance of European children. An ordinance 
passed by the provincial council in 1917 makes the leaving age 15 
instead of 14 and the leaving standard V instead of IV. The prin- 
ciple underlying compulsory education in that Province dates from 
the year 1905, when a school board act was passed making attend- 
ance compulsory for every child over 7 years of age and living 
within 8 miles of a State-aided school. Exemption from school 
was granted with the attainment of the age of 14 or the passing of 
Standard IV of the elementary school course. A further step in 
that direction was made in 1918 when it was generally felt that the 
time was Tipe for an extension of the principle of compulsion. Ac- 
cordingly, ordinance 16 of 1913 made it possible for the distance 
limit, the exemption age, and the exemption standard to be raised 
in selected areas. Finally, by ordinance 7 of 1917, the minimum ex- 
emption age for the whole Province was raised to 15 and the mini- 
mum school year to Standard-V. The school authorities in the Cape 
Province are not satisfied, however, with the results attained, and 
point to the need of further compulsory extension for white children. 
Draft ordinance of 1919 contains the following paragraph: 
From and after the commencement of this ordinance regular school attend- 
ance shall be compulsory in the Cape Province for all children of European 
parentage or extraction who have completed their sixth but not their sixteenth 
year. 
The important matter of free tuition is mandatory at the Cape 
only up to the compulsory limits. Consequently with the extension 
of the compulsory school age an attempt was made to extend the 
privilege of free tuition “up to and including the sixth standard 
of the primary-school course.” A move in that direction can be seen 
in ordinance No. 15 of 1917 that empowers the department under 
certain conditions to pay the school fees of children whose parents 
are on active military service. This regulation applies not only to 
pupils attending schools under school boards but is applicable to 
any school not conducted for private profit,

Legislative measures for a larger school life have not been lim- 
ited to the Cape of Good Hope. In the Province of the Transvaal 
a provision in ordinance No. 16 of 1916, issued by the Department 
of Education, authorizes the local school boards to raise the age 
and the standard of compulsion, if it is found desirable. This 
means that children over 15 years of age or those having reached 
the fifth standard may be compelled to continue their education at 
the option of the school boards. Furthermore, attendance in con- 
tinuation classes can be made compulsory for, children who are 
exempt from attendance at primary schools. 
With regard to compulsory attendance in the Transvaal, vari- 
ous recommendations are proposed. Some school boards advocate 
that compulsory education should end with the attainment of the 
seventeenth year of age or the passing of the fifth standard; others 
recommend the sixteenth year as the age limit or the sixth standard 
as an alternative. As to compulsory continuation classes, there is 
a tendency to have the pupils attend school during the working 
hours for at least 10 hours a week. 
Another regulation bearing upon increased school facilities for 
the children in that Province provides that a public school may be 
established in any country district where the attendance of not less 
than 20 pupils can be assured. The former regulation required a 
minimum attendance of 25. Although the present tendency of the 
department is directed toward centralization—that is, toward larger 
schools with a larger school attendance—the lowering of the re- 
quirements with regard to the establishment of other schools was 
necessitated in order to meet the needs of children who could not. 
otherwise be brought within the reach of larger institutions. 
A scheme inaugurated by the Department of Education in the 
Transvaal further provides Government grants for private schools 
recognized by the authorities as efficient. These grants will un- 
doubtedly raise the standard of the private institutions and bring 
them in line with the schools controlled and administered by the 
various school boards of the Province. 
At the end of September, 1917, the total number of white pupils 
enrolled was 116,491; of native and colored children, 138,397. The 
total number of pupils enrolled in Government-aided schools was. 
254,888, the average attendance being 86.4 per cent. The total num- 
ber of teachers was 10,215, of whom 6,739 were holders of profes- 
sional certificates. 
The Government’s expenditure on education during the fiscal year 
ended March 81, 1917, was $4,751,000, thus apportioned: Head of- 
fice (administration), $51,000; inspection, including transportation, 
$189,000; training of teachers, $429,000; schools under school boards: 
(grants in aid), $2,979,000; schools not under school boards,
-P-A-G-E-195

$182,000; schools under missionary control, $556,000; industrial 
schools, $80,000; good-service allowance, $260,000; pension fund, 
$22,000; incidental expenses, $3,000. 
LANGUAGE PROBLEMS. 
The language question presents considerable difficulties in South 
Africa. At present English and Dutch are recognized as the official 
languages in the Union, a fact which affects the schools to a consider- 
able degree. In the Cape Peninsula instruction in the mother tongue 
is provided up to and including Standard IV, when the second 
language is gradually introduced. The languages hitherto taught 
in public schools were either Dutch or English, but as the conversa- 
tional medium of large circles of the population is Afrikaans, or 
Africander Dutch, the school authorities sanctioned the introduction 
of this tongue as a regular school subject in the non-English classes. 
The more literary Dutch has thus been superseded by Afrikaans, es- 
pecially in the lower grades of the elementary course. An ordinance 
promulgated on May 17, 1918, and known as Education (Afrikaans) 
Ordinance No, 14, 1918, reads: 
Where in any public school to which the provisions of the Education (Lan- 
guage) Ordnance No. 11 of 1912 apply, the Dutch language is lawfully used 
either as a prevailing medium or as one of the media of instruction, it shall 
be competent for the Department of Public Education, on the resolution of 
the responsible school committee, or school board where there is no committee, 
to authorize the use of Afrikaans instead of Dutch (Nederlands) as such 
medium of instruction in all or in any classes of that school up to and includ- 
ing the fourth standard. 
Thus by adopting Afrikaans the Cape of Good Hope has set itself 
to solve the problem of not two but practically three languages. 
The ordinance also permits pupil teachers to answer examination 
papers in Afrikaans, as well as in Dutch or English. 
In the Transvaal the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction 
was sanctioned by the. school authorities sometime ago. Of more 
recent date is the introduction of Afrikaans as a school subject. This 
radical change has been universally welcomed by teachers and pupils 
in schools where hitherto Dutch was the medium of instruction. In 
many instances, however, the introduction of Afrikaans had to be 
postponed for lack of the necessary textbooks. 
One of the school inspectors in the Transvaal, referring to the new 
ordinance (Transvaal Educ. Dept. Rep., 1917), states: 
Great things ‘are expected of Afrikaans, and teachers are everywhere 
enthusiastically studying the subject in order to “see it through.” For the first 
time in the history of the Africander child he will find himself in a position 
of real equality with the other European children. In the past the study of 
language (which after all is little more than a medium of thought) was tak- 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
    196 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
ing up practically all his time, while children of other countries were absorbing 
new ideas almost from the day they entered school. 
In Natal, which is colonized almost throughout by British, the bi- 
lingual ordinance came first into operation in the year 1916, although 
a practical bi-lingualism has long obtained there with the approval 
of the department. The new ordinance reserves to the parents the 
right to decide as to the medium in which their children shall be in- 
structed. In the Orange Free State, except where the parents object, 
both English and Dutch are taught to all children, and where pos- 
sible, are used as equal media of instruction. ; 
The provisions of the language ordinances in the various provinces 
are usually met by setting up parallel classes in the lower standards 
and then teaching each language in its own medium; general sub- 
jects, such as history and geography are taught in the higher grades 
in a mixed medium, unless the school is large enough to allow of a 
similar arrangement as prevails in the lower standards, _ 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
Provision for secondary education is made by public high schools 
or by advanced classes connected with the elementary schools. Pres- 
ent efforts are directed to the promotion of these classes to high- 
school grades wherever the scheme appears to be feasible. In the 
Province of the Transvaal 10 high schools have thus been created 
in addition to the 10 already in existence. The question of transition 
from primary to secondary schools has not been entirely settled in 
that Province. The Transvaal Teachers’ Association is of opinion 
that separate high schools should be built only for pupils who intend 
to matriculate. 
For the rest of the pupils the association urges the maintenance 
of advanced classes in the primary schools. The reason given by 
this body of teachers is that transfer to a secondary institution will 
cause many pupils to drop out. The stand taken by the higher school 
authorities, on the contrary, favors the separation of primary and 
secondary schools. Discussing the advantages accruing from the 
latter arrangement, the director of education for the Transvaal, in 
his report for 1917, says: 
It (the transfer) is an event which stirs and satisfies the impulses and am- 
pitions characteristic of the awakening of adolescence. The spirit of adoles- 
cence is the spirit of adventure; it is a time when hunger for intellectual 
achievement, for the life and associations of youth, for freedgm from the tram- 
mels of childhood, is imperative. Migration to a higher institution is just what 
satisfies it, Transfer is thus, in the first place, justified by the physical and 
mental demands of the pupils themselves. In the second place, it is justified 
py the criterion of efficiency. This will more certainly be gained in an institu- 
tion where the head and his staff devote themselves entirely to secondary needs
-P-A-G-E-197

and secondary subjects. Economy is a third argument. Science is going to 
bulk largely in secondary curricula in the future, and well-equipped laberatories 
will be essential. They can not be provided at a large number of centers. The 
same thing is true of libraries which must be good enough to afford a field 
for adventure in history and literature. Finally, there is the all-important ques- 
tion of playing fields and organized games. The first 11 caps or colors won in 
strenuous competition is the ambition of normal youth. 
In the Cape of Good Hope better adjustment and the abolition of 
the overlapping between the elementary and the secondary school 
course have been effected in recent years. The seventh grade of the 
elementary schools was abolished and the elementary course confined 
to six grades, these to be supeyseded by the secondary school course 
with a four-year syllabus. 
The secondary course is to be reorganized with a view of pede 
general and vocational training. This, at least, is the proposal of 
Dr. Viljoen, the superintendent general of the Cape Province, made 
before the Congress of the South African Educational Union, held 
on December 27, 1918. The scheme involves the inauguration of 
eight courses, each with a four-year syllabus: A preparatory course 
leading to higher education, and a general course for those not in- 
tending to pursue university studies; further, preparatory courses 
for the public service, the teaching profession, and the courses suit- 
able for those who intend to adopt commercial, technical, agricul- 
tural, or domestic pursuits. It is proposed to introduce these courses 
in a limited number by way of experiment rather than to lay down 
hard-and-fast rules and regulations for the entire scheme. 
Training of teachers—With regard to the training of teachers in 
the Cape Province, several tentative proposals have been made by 
Dr. Viljoen. 
The present third class teachers’ certificate (senior) course is to be 
replaced by a lower primary teachers’ certificate course, to commence 
after Standard VI of the primary school course had been completed. 
and to extend over a period of four years. Further, the superin-— 
tendent general proposed the establishment at training colleges of 
a higher primary teachers’ course extending over a period of two 
years beginning after the completion of a full four years’ course at 
a secondary school. In addition to these two courses the training 
schools and colleges.are to offer courses for teachers in infant schools 
and for those intending to specialize in subjects such as domestic 
science, manual training, drawing, music, commercial subjects, ete. 
The supply of certificated teachers, although inadequate for ex- 
isting needs, shows a steady increase, if one makes reference to the 
records of the year ended June 30, 1918. It appears that the teaching 
posts in the Cape Province increased during the year by 198; the 
number of certificated teachers employed increased by 255; while the
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
number of uncertificated teachers employed decreased by 57. Com- 
pared with other Provinces of the Union the Cape employs 39 cer- 
tificated teachers for every 1,000 enrolled pupils, while the Transvaal 
employs 25 certificated teachers, and the Orange Free State 28 on 
that basis. 
AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION. 
Scientific training in the principles of agriculture and stock rais- 
ing is making rapid strides in the Union. This training is carried 
on at four well-equipped agricultural schools conducted by the De- 
partment of Agriculture, as well as a number of experimental farms, 
Two of these schools are situated in the Cape Province, one at Elsen- 
burg and the other at Grootfontein. ‘The third is located at Potchef- 
stroom, Transvaal, and the fourth at Cadara, Natal. A fifth school 
has been built near Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, but due to the 
war conditions, its inauguration has been postponed. The cultiva- 
tion of the soil, experimentation in plants, and the breeding of cattle 
are conducted on an extensive scale, not only for the benefit of the 
students enrolled, but also for the general farming population. 
Horticultural and poultry divisions are maintained in connection 
with each institution. Admission is based on the completion of the 
elementary school. The regular course of instruction covers a period 
of two years. Special short courses are also given during the 
months of June and July each year. These institutions also assist 
the farmer in matters relating to the various phases of farming by 
means of correspondence, publications, lectures, and demonstrations. 
Experiments in soils, crops, and fertilizers are conducted at the 
school farms, at detached experimental stations, and by means of 
cooperative experiments with individual farmers. 
The Government Wine Farm near Cape Town offers a three years’ 
practical training with some theoretical instruction. Agricultural 
faculties have also been established at the University of Stellen- 
. bosch, and at the Transvaal University College, which now forms 
part of the University of South Africa. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
The university problem, closely connected with the political and 
social conditions of the country, have in recent years undergone far- 
reaching changes advocated in South Africa for the last decade. 
With the inauguration of the Union, higher education was placed 
under the control of the central authorities or the minister of educa- 
tion. Until a few years ago the university was a purely examining 
body, which dominated a number of small colleges serving only 
local interests. Various proposals for the creation of a strong na- 
tional university, where the youth of the country could receive a 
commen intellectual training, led to legislative measures with the
-P-A-G-E-199
  EDUCATION IN THE PNION OF SOUTH AFRICA, 199 
result that the entire system of university education in South Africa 
was placed on a higher plane. 
The new scheme put in operation April 2; 1918, was reorganized 
on the following basis: 
1. The South African College became the University of Cape Town. 
2. The Victoria College at Stellenbosch was granted a separate 
charter and became the University of Stellenbosch. 
38. The six remaining colleges—those at Grahamstown, Wellington, 
Bloemfontein, Pretoria, Johannesburg, and Pietermaritzburg—were 
federated in the University of South Africa, a successor of the Uni- 
versity of the Cape of Good Hope, with the administrative seat at 
Pretoria. 
The policy of the newly created institutions is reflected in the 
following statement from a Cape Town correspondent published in 
the London Times Educational Supplement for February 18, 1919: 
The University of Stellenbosch shows a strong tendency to ally itself with 
pronounced Dutch-Nationalist sentiment, and has already become its chief 
intellectual center. -Its students are almost exclusively Dutch-speaking, and 
instruction is being increasingly given through the medium of the Dutch lan- 
guage. Indeed, so strong has the feeling of separate identity become that 
even simplified Netherlands Dutch is in danger of being cast out in favor of 
South African Dutch (Afrikaans). It would seem that the future of the 
University of Stellenbosch is largely bound up with the fate of Afrikaans. If 
that language succeeds in establishing itself as the recognized sister medium 
to English, and in developing a literature (as it shows ‘promise of doing), and 
if the government of the university is alive to the dangers of an exclusive 
parochialism, especially in the matter of appointments to the staff, then the 
University of Stellenbosch will become an intellectual and moral center of 
influence of a peculiarly interesting and valuable type. 
The University of Cape Town continues the tradition of the old South 
African College, which always earned the kicks of extremists from either side 
because of the broad South African nationalism which has always characterized 
it. Ordinarily (though the war,has made a difference) its students have been 
English and Dutch in about equal numbers, and the bitter political and racial 
struggles of the country have had but faint echoes within its walls. During 
the war it has been criticized with about’ equal vehemence by the left wing 
of each racial group, and the present confidence it enjoys and the phenomenal 
development it has recently achieved abundantly justify its maintenance of 
the old attitude. Language difficulties are well-nigh insuperable, but they are 
being handled in a reasonable spirit. 
Stellenbosch specializes in agriculture, while the University of 
Cape Town is developing the faculties of engineering and medicine. 
The faculties of law and education are also likely to become stronger 
in the latter institution. 
EDUCATION OF NONEUROPEAN CHILDREN. 
The non-European population comprises the natives, the mixed 
races or the Eurafricans, and a small contingent of East Indians.
-P-A-G-E-200
    200 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
The education of the natives is entirely the work of missionary or- 
ganizations. The Government supports the mission schools by means 
of grants, but the maintenance of schools devolves upon the mis- 
sionary bodies. Government control over native education is ex- 
ercised through the following agencies: Financial grants-in-aid, cer- 
tification of teachers, issuing of syllabuses, inspection of schools, and 
examination of pupils. The course of study is based on the Euro- 
pean system, with slight modifications to suit the native children. 
Instruction in all the Provinces is imparted through the medium of 
the vernacular, especially in the lower grades. 
The introduction of handicrafts in native schools on a larger scale 
than has hitherto been practiced is being urged by school authorities 
familiar with the problem of native education. One inspector of 
schools points out that “pupils accustomed to the free unfettered life 
of the veld and kraal must find some outlet.” And nothing, he main- 
tains, would so alleviate the sudden transition from the unrestrained. 
liberty of the herdboy to the ordered discipline of a school than 
lessons in grass weaving, clay modeling, woodwork, and needlework. 
These subjects should be encouraged and introduced in all the schools 
for native children. Consideration of industrial training to include 
instruction in agriculture and the native arts and crafts is also urged 
by Dr. Loram, an inspector in Natal. In his book “The Education 
of the South African Native” the author recommends the taking over 
by the Government of all the native schools with a view of establish- 
ing a well articulated system which shall consist of elementary, in- 
termediate, high, and industrial schools and training institutions 
with courses of study complying with the social and industrial needs 
of the natives. The retention of the vernacular is also. strongly 
recommended. 
Missionary* organizations provide schools not only for the native 
but also for other colored children in all the Provinces except the 
Transvaal. In that Province the schools for Eurafricans are under 
direct administration of the department and are supervised by the 
school boards on the same basis as the schools for Europeans. At the 
close of the year 1917 there were in that Province, in addition to 
schools for European children, 19 Government schools for colored 
children, with an enrollment of 2,681, and 330 subsidized mission 
schools with an enrollment of 21,421. 
In addition to the mission schools, the Government subsidized a 
number of Indian schools, notably in Natal, where 39 such schools 
receive grants-in-aid, while 5 schools for Indian children are directly 
maintained by the department of that Province.

THE PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 
By Watrer A. MontTcoMery, 
Specialist in Foreign Hducational Systems. 
INTRODUCTION, 
In no other country of the world is the subject of education more 
complicated than in India. The system maintained or sanctioned in 
the 15 Provinces which are directly or indirectly under British con- 
trol is further complicated by considerations indissolubly inter- 
twined with the historical, climatic, racial, religious, and strictly 
agricultural characteristics of the people. Historically, the system 
still shows in many fundamental features of the vernacular schools 
the native system which prevailed in the larger and more powerful 
Provinces—such as Bengal, Bombay, and Madras—before the official 
consolidation of British power about 60 years ago; and the suc- 
cessive modifications made by the several education commissions, 
provincial and imperial, have left indelible traces upon it. 
India’s racial complexity is a commonplace, more than 40 distinct 
races going to make up her total population of over 250,000,000 
(estimated, 1919). As a consequence the several Provinces represent- 
ing the original nuclei of diverse tribes have developed widely vary- 
ing systems of administration and instruction. This tendency has 
been fostered by the definite policy of the British Government, 
which has been loath to attempt to impose upon India, as a whole, 
one rigid and uniform system, but has wisely sought to confine itself 
to maintaining educational activities in their broadest and most use- 
ful aspect. The difficulties inherent in religious differences and 
jealousies, and in their inevitable consequence, the caste system, 
were unlimited; and even a partially successful harmonizing of 
these, so far as to effect some system of popular instruction, is in 
itself a triumph for British colonial ability. Yet in face of all these 
abstacles, multiplied in many phases in almost every Province, more 
than fair success has been achieved since the original lines of educa- 
tional polity for India were laid down. Marked progress is to be 
recorded, especially during the last reported quinquennium (1912- 
1917), the period adopted by the Indian authorities for a systematic 
and comprehensive report upon the educational conditions of the 
Provinces. 
A consideration of the effects of the war, direct and indirect, on 
Indian education must necessarily precede a more detailed investi- 
gation of conditions in that country. The former have varied ac- 
cording to the location of the Province under consideration, whether 
situated upon the sea coast, and possessing a large port of embarka- 
   
-P-A-G-E-202
202 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
tion of men and supplies, or remote from visible connection with 
the war. To select from those most closely concerned with the war: 
In the Madras Presidency, perhaps the most marked effects were the 
cutting off of the recruiting of teachers from England and Europe 
and the vacancies due to the withdrawal of the teachers for service; 
financial difficulties of growing seriousness making it necessary to 
postpone many educational projects; and, perhaps most marked for | 
this Province, the difficulties encountered in the matter of the mis- 
sionary societies maintaining a system of schools. Most of these were 
German and Lutheran educational missions; and their taking over 
by the Government and continuation with changed committees were 
fraught with many perplexing questions. 
In the Bombay Presidency the effects just noticed were also evi- 
dent; but in this Province a greater gain has been pronounced in the 
interest aroused among people of all classes, not merely among the 
* children in the schools, in the great world issues, in the broadening 
of knowledge and mental horizon, and in the quickened apprecia- 
tion of the unity of the British Empire. In Bombay the very use- 
ful step was taken of applying the machinery of the schools to 
explain to the people at large the real causes and progress of the war. 
This was done by daily talks by the teachers, by the periodical visits 
of the inspectors, by the dissemination of Indian newspapers and 
pamphlets translated into the different vernaculars of the Presidency, 
by lectures and lessons on the war loans, and by the offer of prizes 
for the best essays on the war written by students of secondary and 
higher education. It is doubtful if all other activities of the schools 
were as valuable for the mental awakening of the people as this, 
which might be regarded as merely a by-product of the war. 
In Burma fewer adverse effects of the war are to be noted than 
in any other Province. ~Though for economic reasons attendance 
declined in the lower primary vernacular schools, many important 
changes in administration and instruction were carried out especially 
during the last two years of the quinquennium under consideration. 
The long-discussed and very important transfer of municipal schools 
to the provincial government was finally effected early in 1917; grants 
of half the salaries of teachers were restored in the European schools 
and in most of the aided Anglo-vernacular schools; and the main- 
tenance of these schools was transferred to the Province. Other 
special administrative changes will be indicated under their proper 
headings. 
In the larger field of education throughout the Indian Empire 
financial considerations for the first two years of the war stopped 
the allotment of the imperial grants decreed in 1904. In certain 
Provinces a marked decrease was shown in the attendance in the 
primary schools. But as an offset to these material disadvantages   
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 203 
there were compensating advantages throughout India at large as 
indicated in the reports of representative Provinces, 
‘The most vigorous stimulation of educational interests has come, 
within the past two years, from a far-reaching project of political 
independence for India, culminating in the presentation to the House 
of Commons of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report in July, 1918. The 
officials whose names are thus linked are the secretary of state for 
India and the viceroy. Both were thoroughly conversant with the 
needs of India; both had for years studied the part that education 
must play in the political welfare of the peninsula; and the report, 
in its largeness of view, its exalted vision, its kindly sanity, and its 
deep sympathy with the unrepresented millions and even with the 
classes depressed by the oriental caste system, is an honor to British 
provincial administration. It is difficult to believe that barely a 
century marks the difference in time between the spirit of this report 
and that of rulers of the type of Warren Hastings. The broad 
outlines of the report are as follows: 
1. The report prefaces its review of political and social conditions 
with a survey of the evolution and present state of education in 
India, basing all recommendations upon the prinicple that “educa- 
tional extension and reform must inevitably play an important part 
in all political progress of the country.” 
2. The report concludes that the original decision of 1835, with 
which the name of Lord Macaulay has always been connected, to 
impart western education to the natives by the medium of English 
was at that time the right and indeed the only road. The varied 
demand for enlarged opportunities, now rising with increasing 
force and including always more people, is itself only the logical 
result and the vindication of the work laid down by that decision; 
but— 
8. It has brought an illiteracy of the masses and an uneven dis- 
tribution of education which must be ended. No state of affairs 
which includes 6 per cent of the total population literate and less 
than 4 per cent under instruction can be longer tolerated. 
4. The steadily growing cleavage between the educated minority 
and the illiterate majority is the necessary result of the educational 
system adopted, and the fruitful cause of political and social un- 
rest. From every point of view this cleavage must be stopped; re- 
forms in education must precede all attempts at governmental and 
political reform. 
5. Results which have been economically disastrous have been 
manifest in the fact that the exclusively literary system of higher 
education has produced a growing native intelligentsia, which can 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
204 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
not find employment and becomes humiliated and soured, affording 
the best possible soil for discontented and anarchistic teachings. 
Education is directly responsible for this political and governmental 
ulcer on the body of the country. Only of late years has any complaint 
arisen against the real element which is wrong in the situation, 
namely, the inadequacy of facilities for training in manufactures, 
commerce, and the application of science to active industrial life. 
6. Examining the charge that the traditional educational sys- 
tem of India has failed in character development, the report finds 
that the question trenches upon the very complicated domain of re- 
ligious belief, which in India, as in all primitive countries, is crystal- 
lized along racial lines. The Governmental schools have either 
utterly ignored the problem and attempted no moral instruction, or, 
if a few here and there have attempted it, the disadvantages under 
which the teachers labor, the indifference of children, and the hos- 
tility of parents have been so great as to nullify all attempts. The 
mission schools alone have dared to inculcate ideas of duty, discipline, 
and civic responsibilities and obligations, and in this field they have 
had results which are worthy of admiration. 
7. The report, replying to the criticisms of the very limited diffus- 
ion of education in India, recalls the conservative prejudices of the 
country which rigidly maintaned themselves until the world events 
of the last few years suddenly began to break them up. That they 
are breaking and yielding is seen in India’s undeniable change of 
attitude toward female education. But nothing has yet been done 
to put an end to the profound educational disparity between the 
sexes which must always hopelessly retard any real social or political 
progress. Again, peculiar difficulties arise from the predominantly 
agricultural nature of the population. Such a population, tradition- 
ally suspicious of change, can be reached only by making agri- 
cultural education increasingly practical. At bottom must always 
rest the need of differentiating primary education according to the 
needs of the people to whom it is applied. 
8. The report concludes by emphasizing the urgent necessity of an 
enormous development of educational opportunities side by side with 
any extension of political activities, basing all upon the contention 
that “political thought in India is coming to recognize that advance 
in all lines must be influenced by the general educational level of 
the country.” 
Another report, akin in spirit to the Montagu-Chelmsford Report 
and upon which were based many of its conclusions, was the Indus- 
trial Commission Report, presented early in 1918 and embodying the 
results of many months of investigation in the leading Provinces of 
India. Though primarily economic in subject and aim, it, like the 
Montagu-Chelmsford Report, was of distinct value educationally.  
-P-A-G-E-205
  PROGRESS. OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 205 
It brought clearly to the front the extreme “topheaviness” of a sys- 
tem of education in which less than 3 per cent of the total popula- 
tion are enrolled in the elementary schools; in which the average 
duration of school life is less than four years and nearly half the 
children are in the infant sections of the primary; and in which a 
relapse into illiteracy in adult life is the rule; whereas in the field 
of higher education the percentage of total population enrolled, one- 
twentieth of 1 per cent, is nearly equal to that of England, one- 
sixteenth of 1 per cent, and considerably larger than that of Japan, 
one-thirtieth of 1 per cent. In the field of university education 
alone, India shows one-fortieth of 1 per cent to Japan’s one- 
seventieth of 1 per cent of total population. In the estimation of 
the report, this “topheaviness” could only be cured by an efficient, 
free, and compulsory system of education, and by the building up 
of a modern progressive and economic society. Furthermore, India 
is the only country in the world where the educational ladder, frag- 
mentary at best, has its higher end in another country. This evil, 
too, must be cured by the further establishment in India of centers 
of professional and cultural learning for native Indians, themselves 
graduates of the continuous system of schools below. 
ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS. 
In the domain of administration as such the student of Indian 
education is confronted at the outset by the lack of any compulsory. 
power vested in the central imperial educational authority. No 
parent is compelled by imperial regulation to send his child to school; 
nor is any person prohibited from opening a school or positively 
required to take out a license in order to do so. The system is decen- 
tralized throughout. 
As regards the relation of the Imperial Indian Government to edu- 
cation, in general it may be said that it is advisory and promotive: 
The Government of India * * * considers questions of general policy, 
correlates when necessary the lines of advance made in the various Provinces, 
examines, approves, or submits to the secretary of state for India schemes 
which are beyond the sanctioning power of the local governments, and allots 
imperial grants. 
In order to administer the increasingly larger field covered by 
these activities, the post of director general of education was abol- 
ished in 1910, and a member for education was added to the imperial 
executive council. In April, 1915, the post of Educational Commis- 
sioner was created, whose duties are somewhat akin to those of the 
Commissioner of Education of the United States: 
He tours extensively, discusses questions of educational polity with local 
governments, and advises the department on educational cases. At the same 
time a small bureau of education was reestablished for the collection and dis- 
semination of information.
-P-A-G-E-206
  206 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Each provincial government has a department of public instruc- 
tion, presided over by an official usually designated as the director of 
public instruction, appointed by the provincial government. On 
the side of public education the educational powers of the Province 
are shared with local bodies such as rural boards, municipalities, and 
even private associations and individuals, All these latter are them- 
selves required by law to provide facilities for primary education, 
and some are permitted to provide other forms of education in addi- 
tion. The first piece of educational legislation of a compulsory 
nature ever enacted in India was that passed by the legislature of 
Bengal early in 1918. The act is noteworthy in that it is constructed 
entirely along the decentralizing and autonomous lines which form 
the distinctive feature of the Montagu-Chelmsford Report; and so 
representative is it of the dominant thought of the most advanced 
Provinces that the councils of Madras, the Punjab, and Behar have 
signified favorable action if it should be submitted tothem. It strikes 
at the very root of the mass illiteracy of the Province, applying its 
provisions equally to both sexes (a signal advance over eight years 
ago, when a similar provision was defeated), making the period of 
compulsion to include the whole of the child’s eleventh year and thus 
giving a minimum of five years of school attendance. The compul- 
sory feature is not, as yet, applied to rural areas, but schools are 
provided in each of the more than 1,100 villages of the Province con- 
taining more than 1,000 inhabitants and at present without a primary 
school. No fees are allowed to be charged in any grade of school 
work. 
Any class or community may be exempted from the operation 
of the act by the local provincial government only in such case as 
the municipality can not arrange satisfactorily the education of 
such children, and* they are properly instructed by other means. 
In the vital matter of imposing penalties upon those persons em- 
ploying for profit children who ought to be in school, it is to be 
regretted that economic interests caused a departure from similar 
provisions laid down in the Fisher Act; and so fully recognized 
was the national necessity of child labor both in organized indus- 
tries, on farms, and in the home, as to call for compromise by 
which only those are subject to penalty who employ children of 
school age in such ways and at such hours as to interfere with their 
efficient instruction. 
The weak point of the act is, confessedly, the vagueness of 
the responsibilities of the State in the event that local bodies, 
through poverty or neglect, fail to provide proper instruction. 
But the continuance of the Government quota to local bodies is in 
no way affected by the act; and the lively interest uninterruptedly 
manifested by the provincial governments in the past furnishes
-P-A-G-E-207
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 207 
every guarantee that the danger of the Government not making 
subsidies to deserving local boards is imaginary. Indeed, much is 
expected in the way of the development of local independence from 
the very knowledge that local delinquency can not as now rely upon 
the provincial government to supplement inadequate appropria- 
tions. The act has been commended by the school and secular press. 
The Times of India well summarizes the situation in saying that 
the act must and will be applied “along the sound principle that 
whether State finances are flourishing or the reverse, primary edu- 
cation is a necessity for which money must be found.” 
As regards the machinery by which provincial governments ad- 
minister public instruction, the director controls a staff of inspec- 
tors and the teaching staff of the schools in so far as the teachers 
are employed by the Government, and performs such other duties 
and wield such other powers as usually belong to him in his capacity 
of agent of the provincial government. The organization of the 
inspectional machinery is generally based upon the unit of the rev- 
enue division of the Government. In the Punjab, however, and in 
Bengal, as secondary schools are numerous, second and assistant 
inspectors are added, generally in charge of all local education, and 
are expected to advise the divisional school officials on policies and 
related matters. The detailed inspection of primary schools, how- 
ever, is incumbent upon deputy inspectors, one for each district. 
There are also special inspectors for European schools, for Moham- 
medan education, and in localities where they are needed, for the 
teaching of Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian. In the larger cities 
expert inspectors have recently been appointed in the subjects of 
manual training, drawing, and science. In addition inspectresses 
for girls’ schools are employed so far as the climatic and social 
conditions make it possible. Medical inspection has made encour- 
aging progress, especially in the Punjab and in Bihar and Orissa, 
in spite of the serious interruptions caused by the war. 
Unfortunately, all the Provinces report grave limitations in the 
inadequate number of inspectors, in the narrowed scope of the work 
possible, and in a popular indifference which cripples the efficiency 
of the service. The reports show also that the inspectional system, 
if it is to give adequate supervision to primary schools, especially 
those in villages and remote districts, urgently needs clearer definition 
and better coordination of its several agencies and a large increase 
(especially in Bengal, Bombay, and Madras) of the inspecting staff, 
burdened as this is by many new duties of increasing complexity. 
The most important agency, however, both of control and direct 
management is constituted by the local educational bodies, which in- 
clude rural boards and municipalities. Indeed, they may be re- 
garded as the foundation upon which the primary educational system 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
    208 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
of India rests. Varying widely in areas covered in the several 
Provinces, the rural boards are supreme in matters of education and 
in those pertaining to means of communication. Municipal boards 
in cities and towns have corresponding responsibilities of providing 
instruction. The supreme importance of the functions performed by 
the local bodies of both types, and the wide diversity of their re- 
sponsibilities and scope, well illustrate the decentralized nature of 
educational polity in India. A summary of the salient legal powers 
and duties in the several Provinces is given: 
1. In Madras the municipal act requires the municipality to provide for the 
school instruction of all children of school age, but the responsibility is limited 
by the phrase “so far as the funds at their disposal may admit.” | 
2. In Bombay and the United Provinces the law requires reasonable provision 
for primary schools. In the latter the act requires the municipalities to expend 
on primary education at least 5 per cent of their normal income after the de- 
duction of income from special modes of taxation. In the city of Bombay the 
law requires the corporation to make adequate provision for maintaining, aid- 
ing, and accommodating private schools, but provides that in the event of educa- 
tion becoming free or free and compulsory, one-third of the additional cost shall 
be paid by the Government. 
8. In Bengal the former rule requiring the municipality to spend 3.2 per cent 
of its ordinary income on education has been repealed, but this is taken as a 
suitable standard; and also in the Punjab, Burma, and the central Provinces 
the acts are permissive only, requiring only the application of certain funds to 
the object of education, with varying requirements as to the funds from which 
such funds are to be drawn. In Burma it is provided that the maximum ex- 
penditure for education shall not exceed 5 per cent of the gross annual income. 
4, In Assam it is provided that the percentage spent on primary education 
must not fall short of that represented by the average of the expenditure of the 
previous year and that of the year 1904-5, which is taken as a representative: 
basis. ‘The establishment of a board charged with oversight of all primary 
and middle vernacular schools is left optional with the Government. 
5. The procedure throughout India varies greatly in the grades of schools 
under the charge of local bodies. In the majority of the Provinces the functions 
of local bodies are not limited to primary education, but their chief concern 
is with the primary schools. Most of them give aid to privately managed 
schools, and therefore wield a legal power over the latter. The extent and 
method by which the provincial government shares in the maintenance and 
control of primary schools are of great complexity. In most instances the 
provincial government is largely guided by the advice and wish of the local 
board, provided always that the latter evinces reasonable generosity and feel- 
ing of responsibility for primary education. 
During the five years under consideration the most marked ten- 
dency both in Government and education was that to grant wider and 
larger powers of government to the local authorities. This culmi- 
nated in June, 1918, in the plan issued by the Imperial Government 
of India, definitely disclaiming any policy of general compulsion as 
being unwise under present conditions, but urging all local bodies 
to assume the burden of “a solid advance toward mass education.” 
The additional expenditure for teachers and inspection is to be  
-P-A-G-E-209
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 209 
borne by imperial and local governments, that for the establishment 
and maintenance of physical facilities, buildings, etc., necessary to 
double the enrollment of boys in the primary schools—the goal set 
within 10 years—to be borne by the local boards. 
As matters stood up to that time, local bodies managed the com- 
paratively few local “provided” schools and had control of aided 
schools. Up to 10 years ago, three-fourths of the primary schools 
were under private management, but since that time the tendency 
has been for “ provided” schools to gain much faster than aided (mis- 
sionary) or unaided (native) schools; so that in 1917 more than half 
the pupils throughout India in attendance on primary instruction 
were in these schools. An interesting exception must be made in the 
case of Burma, the Province which shows the highest percentage of 
literates. Here primary education is in the hands of the Buddhist 
monks. Elsewhere unaided schools diminished and provided schools 
increased so rapidly that the authorities see in this a proof that 
“there was left no large outer circle of indigenous institutions suit- 
able for inclusion in the public-school system.” The reasons for the 
rapid growth of board schools during the past five years are that 
better education can be secured and at less than half the cost of the 
unaided school, and that pupils remain much longer in school. The 
policy of expanding primary schools, of including aided (mis- 
sionary) schools, and of encouraging unaided schools also to come 
under Government management has been steadily pursued by the 
school authorities. Under the new action of the Imperial Govern- 
ment of India, wider scope for initiative has been allowed the local 
boards; but the duty still rests upon provincial governments to en- 
courage primary education and, where needed, to assist in maintain- 
ing it by special educational grants. 
It has been shown that the Imperial Government has little control 
over education, yet it plays a great part in aiding schools, chiefly out 
of funds realized by nation-wide taxation. According to local needs, 
it is free to make, and does make, a considerable assignment of 
revenues for definite educational purposes. Similarly, local and mu- 
nicipal funds realized by taxes (usually from “land-cesses”) levied 
by local bodies may be supplemented by provincial funds. In gen- 
eral, the elasticity with which taxes of either of the three categories 
may be applied to educational purposes is absolute, being limited 
only by the provision that funds of, and for, a given Province may 
not be diverted to another. 
As an offset to the wider power and greater responsibility assigned 
to the local boards as indicated above, a contrary tendency is to be 
noted in the way of administrative centralization. This is not gen- 
eral, but as it concerns the two great Provinces of Bengal and Bom- 
171030°—21—Bull. 89 —14
-P-A-G-E-210
210 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
bay it should not be passed over without mention. In them decrees 
in council have transferred certain duties formally wielded by the 
boards to the inspectors and to the college authorities, and have 
delegated executive functions to the directors of secondary schools. 
It is claimed that efficiency has been secured without a sacrifice of the 
good of the schools. In Bengal especially the result has been to vest 
in the director of public education powers hitherto unpossessed by 
him of appointment, transfer, dismissal, and general control of of- 
ficials of low grades in the provincial educational service. 
CLASSIFICATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM, 
The traditional and most convenient classification of the educa- 
tional system of India is that into public and private institutions. 
Public institutions are those offering a course of study prescribed or 
recognized by the provincial department of public instruction or the 
provincial university and certified by competent authority to have 
attained the required standard. In point of management, public 
institutions are divided into those managed directly by the pro- 
vincial government, or by local rural or municipal boards, and those 
managed by societies or individuals, aided by provincial or local sub- 
sidies, or supported by fees, endowments, or subscriptions. Private 
institutions are those financially independent of all aid, and excluded 
from the above categories. They are exclusively conducted by mis- 
sionary activities of religious bodies. Following yet another line 
of cleavage from the above, the racial and lingual-racial, the classi- 
fication is adopted of the vernacular, Anglo-vernacular, the English, 
and the Mohammedan. 
Under the vernacular falls, of course, the great majority of the 
schools of India, the predominant feature being the vernacular pri- 
mary school, which educates the native child from about 5 years of 
age, using the local vernacular dialect alone as the medium of in- 
struction up to 10 or 11. The usual division is into two stages, the 
lower primary, of four years, and the upper primary, of one, two, 
or three years. The greater number of the pupils never advance 
beyond the lower primary, a fact which constitutes perhaps the most. 
serious phase of the problem confronting the educational system of 
India; and the actual length of the average pupil’s schooling is less 
than four years. 
The next higher division is the middle school, which includes (a) 
the middle vernacular, really a continuation school giving instruc- 
tion chiefly in practical subjects, without English, and leading to 
no higher standard, and (0) the middle English school, the begin- 
ning of the Anglo-vernacular division. This is the first school which
-P-A-G-E-211
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 211 
offers opportunity to a native child to pursue his education, and con- 
tains standards preparatory to the high school and articulating with 
it. The high school admits both natives and Europeans, and in most 
Provinces includes more than the American use of the term conveys, 
not only the essential high-school subjects, but also the middle stand- 
ards just indicated, and even occasionally the last year or two of 
the upper primary. 
Above the high schools are the colleges, which are (a) those of 
second or intermediate grade, corresponding in general to the Ameri- 
can junior college of two years; and (6) those of the first grade 
conferring the B. A. or the B. Sc. within four years from the 
completion of the high school and the M. A. or M. Sc. within five 
or six years therefrom. 
PRIMARY VERNACULAR SCHOOLS. 
The primary vernacular school is the pivot of popular education 
in India. Except in a few districts, it is attended almost exclusively 
by boys. Instruction is sometimes continued through the middle 
vernacular classes, but the overwhelming majority of children never 
advance beyond the lower primary. In 1917 the primary schools and 
the primary departments annexed to other schools numbered some- 
what over 140,000, with 6,748,101 pupils enrolled. This was an in- 
crease of 16 per cent over 1912, but registered an increase of only 2.8 
per cent of the total population. Only 29,313,545 rupees are ex- 
pended on them, a per capita of 44 rupees ($1.30). The low propor- 
tion of expenditure on elementary as compared with higher forms 
of education is the startling and significant feature of the entire 
situation, along with other facts reenforcing the well-known indict- 
ment of “ topheaviness ” against the entire system. 
The evil naturally varies in intensity from Province to Province. 
Bombay and Bengal pay better teachers’ salaries, and the expendi- 
ture upon primary schools in these two Provinces is less dispropor- 
tionate than the average; but the evil of overcrowded and unequipped 
primary education is substantially as stated. Attempts have been 
been made, notably that in 1916-17 by the government of Bihar and 
Orissa, for the expansion of primary education by the district boards 
with the object of doubling the percentage of children enrolled in 
schools by opening additional schools and by a species of consolida- 
tion of schools. Another problem pressing for solution but for which 
none has been found is that presented by the fact that the school 
child of India abandons school within less than four years and be- 
tween 10 and 12 years of age, and often relapses into complete illit- 
eracy.
-P-A-G-E-212
212 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
In the face of these problems changes, such as those in the curricula 
and methods of instruction, seem of minor consequence. Only in the 
western division of Bengal can a new curriculum be said to have 
been prepared. It was to be brought into force in 1918. The dif- 
ferences between the curricula for rural and for city schools are 
generally unrecognized. In some Provinces, in the attempt to keep 
boys in school longer, the directors have striven to give an agricul- 
tural tinge at least to education in rural schools by requiring the 
teachers to call attention to plant and animal life, to make reading 
and arithmetic questions concern themselves with agricultural meth- 
ods and production, and to impart instruction in land records to ad- 
vanced pupils. 
The question of the medium of instruction has never been a trou- 
blesome one, primary education being almost always synonymous 
with vernacular education even in the primary standards attached to 
the secondary schools. The point at which instruction in English 
is begun varies from Province to Province, according as the lower 
primary has or has not infant standards and four or six standards 
besides; but practical uniformity exists in that the use of English 
as a medium of instruction (except in the case.of east Bengal) always 
begins after the completion of the middle standards. 
In Burma the largest educational increase recorded in India was 
shown, primary schools for boys increasing by 42 per cent and pupils 
in attendance upon them by 88 per cent for the five years up to 
June, 1917. A large part of this was due to the satisfactory settle- 
ment of the peculiar problem presented by primary education in this 
Province, namely, the assimilation of Buddhist monastic schools in 
the educational system, and the marked improvement of their teach- 
ing staff. These monastic schools are the most vigorous feature 
still left of the original educational system which prevailed before 
British occupation; and, forming as they do the principal means 
for the moral instruction of the youth, they can not be ignored. 
Indeed so influential were they locally that only by their main- 
tenance and strengthening could the moral and political welfare of 
Burma be subserved. A satisfactory arrangement was made, the 
Government taking over the responsibility of financial support, ap- 
pointing deputy inspectors, and in general bringing increasing num- 
bers of these schools under the educational control of the Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction. The schools of Burma also must be 
credited with the only far-reaching change made in India during the 
five years under consideration. This was the introduction of a spe- 
cial course for boys who did not proceed beyond the fourth grade. 
No reports of the success of this experiment are available, but they 
are awaited with great interest by all students of Indian education
-P-A-G-E-213
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 2138 
as dealing with a problem whose solution will be of inestimable value. 
During the year 1917-18 officials of Burmese education, with the 
consent of the Government, effected important changes in the cur- 
ricula for Anglo-vernacular schools. 
The chief effect of these changes was to prescribe a modified and uniform 
course in geography for these schools; to simplify the course in arithmetic for 
girls so as to leave more time for domestic economy and needlework, now com- 
pulsory; to separate hygiene from elementary science, making it compulsory 
for boys and girls in the primary and middle schools but optional in high 
schools, to amplify the courses in elementary science and object lessons, and to 
add morals and civics as a new subject in primary and middle schools. Ar- 
rangements were made for the preparation of a new series of textbooks in the 
above subjects as well as in geography. 
To Burma also must be given the credit of effecting the most im- 
portant administrative change of the five years, namely, the creation 
of a system of divisional boards to undertake, under the general con- 
trol of the Educational Department, the administration of certain 
branches of vernacular education. The methods of handling of edu- 
cational finances were also so simplified when these boards were created 
as to call to popular attention their increased responsibility for 
vernacular education. A conference held in 1916, participated in by 
representatives of native as well as British education, cordially ac- 
cepted the arrangement, and divisional boards now have charge of 
all matters affecting vernacular education, subject only to the veto 
of the Department of Education. 
With the stirring of ideas looking toward larger popular powers 
both in government and in education, and with the demands for com- 
pulsory education, intangible in most places and yet culminating in 
the Bengal act, there has been realized more thoroughly the ineffi- 
ciency of the system of education as regards reaching the vast unlet- 
tered population of India. The demand for mass education, scarcely 
heard 10 years ago, has now so grown in volume as to fill the jour- 
nals and public press, and to occupy a large part of the attention of 
provincial legislative assemblies. It has also significantly written 
itself on the mind of the governing Englishman, as is shown most 
conclusively by the Montagu-Chelmsford Report to Parliament, and 
on Indian soil proper by the circular letter addressed in 1917 to the 
local governments by the Imperial Government. 
Grasping this demand in all its causes and implications, the edu- 
cational officials of India do not hesitate to accept it as largely justi- 
fied, and to use it as a powerful lever in their efforts toward thorough- 
going reform. In summarizing the general lines of progress made 
during the five years from 1912 to 1917, undeniable on the spiritual 
as well as the material sides, Dr. Sharp, educational commissioner of 
the Indian Empire, well sets forth what must continue to be the 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
214 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
weakness in primary education in India so long as the masses are 
unreached : 
But it is impossible to rest content with an expansion of mass education on 
present lines or with a system under which a large proportion of the pupils are 
infants stagnating in a créche, and the remainder glean only an acquaintance 
with the three R’s, and only a small residue continue to the stage where 
some of the fruits of this initial labor can be reaped. Given sufficient funds 
and sufficient schools, education could probably be made universal on a com- 
pulsory or on a voluntary basis within a comparatively short time; but it 
would be an education which in many cases ended almost with the cradle and 
left 39 per cent of its recipients totally illiterate a few years after its cessation. 
This is the real crux of the problem. At the moment that a boy reaches a 
stage of reasonable intelligence he also becomes a useful economic asset, and 
even if he has not at once to begin labor in the field or factory, the utility 
of further study ceases to be apparent. To overcome this attitude we must 
look partly to better teaching, possibly to the addition of vocational classes, 
but mainly to the economic changes which are slowly permeating the country— 
agricultural progress, cooperative movements, and the growth of industries 
* * * , It is on economic progress that the future rests. We can not expect 
to see in India a literate and intelligent proletariat until that progress has 
permitted the provision of the necessary funds for more schools and more 
efficient schools and brought about the necessary change in the attitude of the 
people. 
An interesting phase of primary education for native children is 
seen in that provided since 1916 by the Government for the children, 
and more especially the orphans of Indians serving the Empire in 
the Great War. Liberal grants have been made to the provincial 
school officials for aid to such children studying in the primary 
schools and also for the purpose of establishing new schools along 
modern lines in localities where needed. A striking feature is that 
all such provisions are applicable to girls as well as boys. Any 
child whose father is certified to have been slain or incapacitated in 
the service is entitled to free primary education with graduated 
allowance or to free scholarship in any middle school or to compete 
for scholarships in higher education. The Madras presidency led 
the way early in the war in exempting the children of actual com- 
batants in the service from payment of all fees in the elementary 
schools. The amount presented by the women of India as a silver 
wedding gift to the Queen-Empress has at her request been devoted 
to the education of the children of fallen Indian soldiers. The Bom- 
bay presidency was the first to establish a technical school not only 
for adolescent children but also for disabled Indian soldiers for 
instruction in the trades. 
A problem unique to India is the education of backward and de- 
pressed classes, such as the aboriginal, and hill and forest tribes, 
the classes subject to caste discrimination and neglect, the criminal 
tribes, and the communities, religious and racial, which present special 
problems. Naturally these classes vary so vastly from Province to
-P-A-G-E-215
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 215 
Province, and even within the same Province, in the causes underlying 
their condition and their needs, and in the methods to be used in their 
instruction, that no general rule can be laid down. The directors 
of public instruction are uniformly alive to the appeal made by these 
classes, educationally and socially, and a growing determination to 
minister adequately to them is manifest in the last reports of educa- 
tion in India. In this work the aid of the mission agencies has 
been invaluable. By years of patient toil they win the confidence of 
these classes, learn their tongue, found schools, and reduce to writ- 
ing languages which have never been written. : 
Even more pathetic is the condition of the depressed classes, for 
they suffer more acutely from the immemorial tyranny of the caste 
system. As is evident, this question is complicated by many of the 
most subtly difficult phases of Indian social life. Here again Govern- 
ment schools must be supplemented by missionaries, both Christian 
and native; but throughout there must be taken into account the 
difficulty of securing as teachers natives of the better caste. Work 
among the criminal tribes, which only a generation ago were a 
terror in most of the Provinces of India, has been steadily pursued. 
An interesting fact is that the most successful agency for dealing 
with such tribes is the Salvation Army, which has established set- 
tlements remote from civilization and is imparting systematic indus- 
trial and moral training. Unequally applied, but of general use in 
the education of these classes, are such measures as special in- 
spection under the auspices of the Government, scholarships and 
fee exemptions, a special system of hostels under moral control, in- 
struction in industries and in weaving, carpentry, and silk culture. 
The subject of the teachers upon whom primary vernacular educa- 
tion devolves is necessarily a most important one. The salaries, as 
all the directors freely admit, are inadequate, though what is deemed 
some improvement has taken place during the five years under con- 
sideration. In the representative Provinces of Madras, Bombay, Ben- 
gal, and the Punjab, the average salary is, respectively, 10,1 28, 7.5, 
and 12 rupees. In Burma it is the highest in the Empire, being 40 
rupees per month. The dire necessity of supplementing salaries in 
various ways is a significant commentary upon the real situation. 
Teachers in many places are granted very precarious fees; again, they 
serve as branch postmasters, an arrangement long criticized, but still 
continued by the authorities; and in the more remote settlements they 
eke out their salaries by having charge of the cattle pounds, sanita- 
tion, and registration of cattle in the district. As the directors 
recognize in their reports, the raising of the standard of teachers and 
their place in the public estimation can only come from increase of 
salaries.

SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
The division of secondary education into the vernacular and the 
Anglo-vernacular shows the extent of the departure from the uniform 
character of primary education. As regards the grading in this di- 
vision, it includes the middle standard, whose exclusive purpose is 
to prepare boys for the high stage; and the high standard, leading 
directly to the colleges or technical school. 
The middle standard is, except in the Central Provinces, entirely 
vernacular, though in most of the Provinces the study of English on 
the literary side is begun with the middle courses. A complicating 
element is also found in the fact that the middle standard usually 
has attached to it the upper primary classes. Indeed, this is the 
case everywhere except in Bombay and the Central Provinces. The 
middle vernacular schools constitute the type usually found in the 
rural districts; but there is increasing complaint that boys of talent 
and even high caste, whose only opportunity such a school is, upon 
its completion can not easily, if at all, be transferred to an English 
school. 
In the few cases where such a transfer can be effected such a boy 
finds himself without the necessary training in English. 
This problem has been clearly seen by most of the directors of 
public instruction. To take a representative Province, in Madras 
the attempt was made to draw a sharp distinction between secondary 
and elementary education. It was hoped that this would compel 
promising native boys to begin the study of English earlier in the 
vernacular school; but the attempt was found impractical, and the 
director reports that further means will have to be sought for prop- 
erly grounding native boys who may be destined for a professional 
or public career, and for protecting the secondary schools from a 
large influx of ill-prepared boys from the elementary schools. 
The high standard, which offers instruction ranging from one to 
three years, is conducted solely through the medium of English, and 
prepares directly for college and technical school. Its curriculum is 
modeled closely upon that of the classical public schools of England, 
such as Eton and Rugby. It naturally appeals almost exclusively 
to the boys of Europeans, and the few native Indian boys, destined 
to governmental employment, who have enjoyed unusual advantages. 
of early training from tutors in English and classics. 
The “ top-heaviness” characteristic of the system of education in 
India is clearly illustrated in the secondary field. As this division 
is practically restricted to boys, the comparison must be instituted 
with the number of boys in the primary. This, in 1917, was 5,614,- 
633, being 4.5 per cent of the total male population. In secondary 
education, the total enrollment for the same year was approximately
-P-A-G-E-217
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 217 
1,250,000, being 1 per cent of the total male population, and an 
even more striking increase of 28.3 per cent for the quinquennium 
under consideration. Here is met the most significant feature in 
Indian education, the numerical increase in secondary education. 
This varies from Province to Province, Bengal marking the highest 
percentage, having 35.8 of all the secondary schools, and 35 per cent 
of all the secondary pupils in India. But the phenomenon is marked 
in them all. If Bengal may be taken as representative, the director 
finds the following reasons for so extraordinary a popularity : 
1. The partition of Bengal into two governmental districts with 
more effective administrative and financial handling. 
2. The fostering of education by the Government, especially 
among the Mohammedans, a people traditionally inclined to edu- 
cation. 
8. The prevailing high mark of prosperity, with the consequent 
ambition of the middle class to advance their children by means of 
secondary education into professional careers and governmental civil’ 
service. 
With this phenomenal increase in secondary education, however, 
it was not to be expected that there should be a corresponding 
improvement in the extent to which it answers the needs of the native 
population, though in every Province earnest attempts have been 
made to make it do so. The provincial governments have everywhere 
recognized their responsibility to provide facilities at the larger 
centers, and have striven to relieve local bodies of the increased ex- 
penses of secondary education, to leave local funds free for use in 
elementary instruction, and above all to improve the salaries and 
living conditions of teachers. But after all has been done, it is 
still recognized that the crowding of ill-prepared native students 
into secondary schools, the inevitable corollary of the inertia of the 
primary schools remains an evil which disastrously affects the whole 
system. 
In 1916, the Government of India submitted an exhaustive scheme 
for the approval of the several Provinces, whose main features were 
the reorganization of the service to which the graduates of high 
schools might aspire, the opening of additional high schools, the 
systematic financing of middle English schools by the Government, 
and a thorough overhauling of schedules and programs of studies. 
Another suggestion has been that the provincial government pre- 
scribe a maximum limit of, say, 40 pupils for high-school classes or 
sections; Madras and Bombay have already adopted such a limit, 
but the problem still remains unaffected by such palliative measures. 
It has been thought that the trouble lies with the impractical and 
too literary nature of the curricula; and therefore in the advanced
-P-A-G-E-218
218 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Provinces, such as Bombay and Madras, science, drawing, and man- 
ual arts have been made compulsory in many high schools, and others 
such as history and geography have been articulated with the life 
of the students. 
In short, while the officials think that solid improvement has taken 
’ place in the spirit of secondary education and in the sincere desire 
for reform, yet the standard of secondary education is still discour- 
agingly low because of inadequate staff and poor pay of teachers, 
overcrowding and defective discipline. As the educational commis- 
sioner reports: 
The apparently inexhaustible demand for secondary education, combined 
with the difficulty of meeting it in an adequate manner, tends to swamp the 
effects of reform. Existing schools are improved, but new ones spring up, low- 
ering the average of attainment, and undermining discipline. 
According to official reports of the year 1918, the general condition 
,of secondary education throughout India at large had shown little 
improvement for several years preceding; but that year marked the 
introduction, in several Provinces, of important changes in the sys- 
tem of examinations in secondary schools. Details differ from 
Province to Province; but the common tendency has been to abolish 
the old blanket permit of college or university matriculation, and 
to stiffen up the examination or leaving certificate required by the 
individual secondary school. Examination upon a minimum of cer- 
tain specified subjects is required. This move is interesting as run- 
ning counter to the trend of modern secondary educational thought, 
which, certainly in the west, is setting ever more steadily toward 
easier articulation between the secondary school and the higher in- 
stitution, and toward less emphasis upon examinations pure and 
simple. In India, however, it is only fair to point out the abuses | 
which developed under the old system of easy matriculation, which 
was perhaps chiefly responsible for the swollen enrollment of the 
higher institutions with their masses of ill-prepared students. 
A material feature of secondary education in India must not be 
passed over without notice. This is the institution of the so-called 
“hostel,” by which is meant the boarding hall under the direct super- 
vision of the school, with varying arrangements as to mess halls, 
and presided over by either the school head or one of the older as- 
sistants. As a large number of native boys do not live in close 
proximity to schools of secondary grade, and must attend such 
schools more or less distant, the importance of the hostel in their 
school life can not be overrated. The hostels naturally vary ex- 
tremely in their character and in the habits of regularity, method, 
orderliness, and cleanliness which they inculcate. The negligent 
and even criminal conditions, with insanitary lodgings and exposure 
   
-P-A-G-E-219

to temptations, which have been discovered in many instances, have 
aroused directors and students of education to the duty of the 
State to see that so large a proportion of the school population shall 
live in a wholesome environment. Under compelling circumstances 
as they exist at present, it is recognized that the hostel system can 
not be done away with, but must be accepted, improved, and even 
extended. The Province of Madras in particular (where one boy 
in every five in secondary schools lives away from home) has grappled 
with the situation by a systematic study of the character and condi- 
tions of the hostels within its borders. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
The Indian colleges are divided into those which offer a general 
‘education and do not especially prepare candidates for any pro- 
fession, and those which do prepare students for the professions. 
The former class fall usually under the head of colleges of arts and 
general science, themselves being subdivided into English and 
oriental colleges, with the latter of which we are not here concerned. 
The arts colleges, which train students by the medium of the Eng- 
lish language in the usual subjects, are divided into first and second 
grade colleges. The latter, approaching in character and purposes 
the American junior college, do not confer a degree. The first- 
grade college graduates the students in all academic degrees and. 
even offers a full graduate course. 
While the colleges do not vary essentially in organization from 
Province to Province, they do vary decidedly in historical develop- 
ment, in number, in location, and in efficiency. Madras represents 
one extreme in the considerable number of scattered colleges, and of 
the second-grade and mission colleges; while Bombay and the 
Punjab represent the other extreme, that of the so-called “intensive 
development,” grouping all eight of her colleges in three great 
centers. Following the English model, the colleges of all Provinces 
are closely affiliated to the universities, their courses and examina- 
tions, and even internal regulation and inspection, being prescribed 
directly by the universities. In certain Provinces, as in the case of 
Bengal, the university has power to annul the action of the college 
authorities in the matter of students’ appeals from decisions and in 
the arrangement and conduct of hostels and mess rooms. 
Among the pressing problems connected with the methods and 
the success of college instruction, the chief perhaps arises from the 
fact that the staff is usually ineffective in number for the great size 
of the classes under its charge. This complaint is voiced in most 
of the reports of the provincial directors. The situation is but an- 
other symptom of the “top-heaviness” already dwelt upon. In 1917 
the colleges numbered 134, and showed an enrollment of 47,000
-P-A-G-E-220
    220 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
students, both native and European; registering a percentage of 
four-hundredths of one per cent of the total male population, and 
an increase of 60 per cent since 1912. 
Within the past five years the question of the exclusive use of 
‘English as the medium of instruction in the colleges has come to the 
front, after having lain dormant since the early thirties, when Lord 
Macaulay’s famous minute convinced the Government of India of 
the necessity of English as the only means of instruction. The 
Province of Bengal has led the way in declaring for bilingual in- 
struction in the courses of its colleges, the other language being 
Bengali. This decision was arrived at after mature consideration 
of the claims of all languages spoken in the Province and the estab- 
lishment of the fact that a considerably larger proportion of students 
use Bengali as their native tongue than any other. This decision, 
furthermore, does not affect the subject or content of courses offered 
nor relieve the student from satisfying the requirements in English 
literature and composition both at entrance and in course. 
The tutorial system of studies, favored by most directors, under the 
direct influence of the English system, is profoundly and adversely 
affected by conditions varying with financial inability, with indi- 
vidual numbers of students, and with attainments of the tutors them- 
selves. The tutorial system is most firmly established in the colleges 
of the Punjab; elsewhere it has at best a precarious footing. 
As regards the conditions under which the students live, the 
hostel system which has been considered in secondary education plays 
also a large part in the colleges. Because of the maturity of college 
students as compared with those in the middle and high schools, the 
system is regarded as most successful in the colleges. The director 
of public instruction in Bengal thus summarizes the place of the 
hostel: 
Some parents whose sons could attend from home are said to prefer their 
residence in hostels because of the good influence which it exercises. Other 
means are used to promote corporate life and common interest. In Calcutta 
(where residential arrangements are defective) the colleges of the university 
acquired a fine building for social gatherings of students and their elders. 
In the well-managed colleges throughout India there is now an esprit de corps. 
and a vigor of life which contrasts refreshingly with the languidly laborious 
existence which less favorably situated students still endure. Athletics, literary, 
debating, and scientific societies, and the production of magazines are usual 
features of college life, taking to some extent the place of general reading, 
which has not the same attraction for Indian as for English youths. 
The five universities of India—those of Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, 
the Punjab, and Allahabad—were founded within the first 30 years 
of British rule, and until five years ago were considered as meeting 
all demands for the country. Their constitutions are modeled largely 
upon those of the English universities: They are governed by a
-P-A-G-E-221
  
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 221 
chancellor (the Viceroy or the governor of the Province), a vice 
chancellor, a senate diversely made up but along the lines laid down 
at Oxford and Cambridge, faculties and boards of studies, and 
finally a syndicate i in whom are vested extraordinary powers of ap- 
peal and review. With the enormous increase in secondary educa- 
tion, the five years under review saw the awakening of a need for 
additional universities of various kinds. The Hindu university at 
Benares and the university at Patna opened their doors in October, 
1917; the university of Mysore, under legislative incorporation of the 
Province, in July, 1917. The Indian university for women, a private 
institution, with scattered branches whose administrative center is 
at Poona, was founded in 1917. 
The constitution and aims of the first mentioned are significant. 
It is frankly denominational, admitting persons of all classes, castes, 
and creeds, but imparting religious instruction in the Hindu tenets. 
It is sustained by large private and popular contributions, and begins 
on a more independent plane than any other hitherto known. The 
posts of chancellor and vice chancellor will be filled by the governing 
body. It is not—as are most of the other universities—an affiliating 
body controlling colleges scattered over a vast area, but its jurisdic- 
tion is limited to Benares and such colleges as may be established 
there. Important innovations are made in the constitution and 
functions of the several bodies which govern it, of which the main 
features are that administration is vested in a court composed of 
donors and persons chosen by various bodies, and that all academic 
control is vested in a senate consisting not necessarily of teachers in 
the university but of outsiders elected by the senate itself. 
Of the schemes pending for the establishment of additional uni- 
versities, most important is that for a university in Burma. This 
has grown steadily in popular interest during the five years under 
consideration, and plans are ripe for fruition within the next two 
years. 
That a new conception of the purposes of higher educational train- 
ing is permeating those in charge of Indian affairs is evident from 
the summary of college and university education in India given by 
Dr. Sharp, educational commissioner, in his seventh quinquennial 
review (1912-17) : 
Thus two lines of development are running side by side. The old universities 
continue mainly, as they were in the past affiliating institutions. * * * 
Meantime, new universities are springing into life—some, replicas of the old, 
but with smaller areas and with an endeavor at partial concentration around 
the university sight; others completely centralized and primarily teaching in- 
stitutions. It is recognized that university problems in India are of a far- 
reaching nature, and that the best professional advice is requisite at the 
present juncture. * * * His excellency Lord Chelmsford, in addressing 
the recipients of degrees at Calcutta said: ‘“ Only the other day I asked a  
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Jaw student why he was taking up law, with all its risks and disappointments. 
He answered, What else is there for me to take up? I am not going to discuss 
his answer, but this I will say, it is my sincere hope, and it is the policy of 
my Government, to endeavor by all means in our power to open up other 
avenues of employment. So long as students think that the only avenues of 
employment are in the legal and clerical professions, so long shall we get con- 
gestion and overcrowding in those professions, with consequent discourage- 
ment, disappointment, and discontent. Our policy then is first to secure that 
there shall be as many opportunities of a livelihood opened to the educated 
classes and next to endeavor to divert the students into channels other than 
those of law and Government clerical employ.” 
TECHNICAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, 
The recognition of the vast economic and social value of practical 
lines of education in India has been seen in the Montagu-Chelmsford 
Report. It is also everywhere emphasized in the reports of the 
_ directors of public instruction for the several Provinces. A sig- 
nificant trend is also showing itself in the action of the local govern- 
ments in depending more and more upon advisory committees whose 
duty it is to study the needs of the individual Province, peculiarly 
with reference to technical and industrial education, and to give 
expert advice both in management and in general policy. The 
adaptation of modern education to a country like India, for ages im- 
movable in her social and educational ideas, is necessarily most com- 
plicated. 
Perhaps the outstanding feature to be recorded of the five years 
under consideration is the work of a committee representing the 
Provinces at large upon the education of civil engineers. This com- 
mittee considered carefully such questions as a low age limit for 
students entering engineering schools, requirements for admission 
to such, minimum knowledge of English necessary, articulation with 
Government colleges, in short all the problems confronting the de- 
velopment of an increasing body of native students of engineering. 
It is agreed that only in the development of such a native body, 
both in engineering and allied lines of practical training, can means 
be found to stem the flow of young Hindus into the law and Goy- 
ernment service. 
The urgent need of industrial education began to make itself’ felt 
about 15 years ago, when a committee appointed by Lord Curzon 
suggested an apprentice system maintained by the State. In addi- 
tion, the Imperial Government encouraged the establishment by the 
local governments of trade schools of various grades. The next 10 
years saw many schemes, some fanciful, most too costly, and others 
still impracticable, put into operation. In Madras and Bengal espe- 
cially the schemes for industrial -education in weaving, dyeing,
-P-A-G-E-223
PROGRESS. OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 223 
mechanical engineering, and plumbing were most practical and fruit- 
ful. It is interesting to note that the scheme for the State training 
of apprentices was dropped, but led to the establishment of Govern- 
ment trade schools, where continuation classes are provided for 
youths still in the employ of various firms, an interesting anticipa- 
tion of provisions in the Fisher Act. On the whole, however, indus- 
trial education in India has hitherto attained only a limited measure 
of success. The causes, racial and governmental, lie deep below the 
surface; but that the situation is capable of improvement and that 
it is improving is emphasized by the directors of the advanced 
Provinces. 
The sign of greatest promise is the existence of the Indian Indus- 
trial Commission, with its encouragement of practical instruction in 
manual arts and domestic science in the common primary and ele- 
mentary schools. The report of this commission, presented early in 
1919, makes the radical recommendation that the general control of 
noncollegiate industrial and technical education should be trans- 
ferred to the Department of Industries, though the cooperation of 
the Education Department can not be dispensed with. The commis- 
sion feels that an education purporting to train for industrial life 
must have direct organic connection with industries and industrial 
employers; that teachers and inspectors should be trained by the 
Industries Department not merely for independent schools but also 
for industrial and technical apprentice classes annexed to commer- 
cial plants. 
The Government of India has never lost sight of the supreme im- 
portance of agricultural education in India. This is one subject 
that is free from complications, inasmuch as its two fundamental 
objects—the improvement of agricultural methods and the better- 
ment of the material and economic conditions of the vast mass of the 
people of India—confront all students of the subject on the threshold. 
To devise ways to reach influential classes, such as the landed and 
more prosperous cultivating class, a number of conferences partici- 
pated in by students of general education as well as of agriculture 
have been held. Chief of these was that held in Simla in June, 1917, 
at which were represented all the Provinces of the Empire. It 
recammended the foundation of agricultural middle schools, the 
specific training of teachers for such schools, the adaptation of pri- 
mary education to rural needs, the establishment of an agricultural 
college in each of the principal Provinces of India, and the more 
general diffusion of agricultural knowledge among the mass of the 
people by the demonstration of improved methods and by instruc- 
tion brought to the illiterate tiller of the soil. 
Most of the agricultural colleges in existence report a grave lack 
of interest among the people, as evinced by the small number of
-P-A-G-E-224
  224 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
students generally attending and by the even more serious lack of 
demand for specially trained men on the part of the landholders 
and agents of large tracts. Attempts have been made to increase 
interest in individual colleges by reducing the length of course and 
by offering practical courses rather than those upon scientific sub- 
jects. Most of the so-called agricultural colleges, according to re- 
ports, are very little more than secondary schools. 
THE EDUCATION OF GIRLS. 
With the stirring of reform movements in Government, and the 
proposal to extend suffrage to women, the education of women in 
India has become within the five years under consideration a burn- 
ing question, such as was never anticipated it would be. Speaking 
generally, little provision is made in the governmental schools of 
India, vernacular or Anglo-vernacular, for the education of girls. 
They are educated mainly in special schools, which are generally 
private except in districts where, as in the Central Provinces, the 
Government has taken over control. Only in Burma, where ex- 
tremely early marriage does not prevail, are the schools mixed. 
The subject is, like so many others, complicated by innumerable tra- 
ditions and social limitations. According to the inspectresses of va- 
rious districts, difficulty is experienced in securing Indian ladies of 
position to work upon local committees, in attracting women of 
proper character, attainments, and caste to work as teachers, in secur- 
ing regular attendance, in inducing girls to remain in school for a 
reasonable length of time, and back of all in combating and overcom- 
ing the age-old hostility to educating women at all. Despite these 
social as well as educational difficulties, however, the great increase 
of 29.2 per cent is to be recorded for the past five years in the total 
number of native girls under instruction in India. This for 1916-17 
reached the surprising total of nearly 1,300,000 girls. More impor- 
tant than the increase in numbers is the change which is being 
wrought in the attitude of the public, a change which applies not only 
to the essentials of primary education, but also to secondary schools. 
Authorities agree that: 
Indian public opinion has slowly changed from its former attitude of positive 
dislike to the education of women and is now much more favorable as regards 
every community. * * * Professional men now wish to marry their sons to 
educated girls who can be in a real sense companions and helpmates; therefore 
education is beginning to be valued by parents as improving the marriage 
prospects of their daughters. 
A large part of the credit for the advance of female education is 
due to the fact that the quality of teaching in schools for girls is 
better than in those for boys. This is especially pronounced in sec-
-P-A-G-E-225
  PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 225 
ondary schools, both those under mission management and those, as 
in the Central Provinces, maintained by the Government. Again, 
modern courses in industrial and vocational subjects have been intro- 
duced in many girls’ schools, and increased attention has been paid 
to physical training. Here immediate results of modern diet and 
training have been most pronounced. 
Another interesting phase of women’s education well shows how 
closely related are social and educational considerations in India. 
The institution of extremely early marriage, and its concomitant of 
a large number of child widows in the great Brahman States of 
Madras, Bombay, and Bengal, have led school authorities to take 
measures for the education of that element of the population which 
has hitherto been neglected and Jed a sad and useless life. For the 
most part such Brahman child widows are distinctly intelligent and 
their training as teachers, especially for secondary schools, has 
been attended with marked success. The school authorities see in 
this a powerful incentive toward the popularizing of secondary 
education amongst the Hindu people. 
A word should be said as to the encroachment of English educa- 
tion for girls upon the vernacular education. From all reports, the 
appreciation of English education is growing, largely because in the 
public mind English influences are held responsible for the exist- 
ence of any education for women at all. Some authorities see the 
future of girls’ education as lying in a judicious extension of the mid- 
dle English schools, whose graduates should furnish a nucleus of edu- 
cated opinion as well as a trained corps of teachers. The director 
of public instruction for Bengal vigorously summarizes the situ- 
ation : 
We may at least hope that in dealing with the education of girls, we shall 
not repeat the mistakes which have been made in the education of boys. There 
will be no excuse if we do, for the girls of Bengal with comparatively few excep- 
tions do not have to be trained to scramble in the open market for a living 
* %* %* Wor many years yet secondary and higher education will be confined 
to the few. Is it too much to hope that we shall be able so to order things 
that the education given will be a reality? There is only one way of accom- 
plishing this, and that is by securing cultured and sympathetic women to work 
as inspectresses and in colleges and schools and by giving these women as free 
a hapd a possible. If we determine to do this and do not shrink from the bill— 
it will not be an unlimited liability—we shall be giving Indian women a chance. 
EDUCATION OF MOHAMMEDANS. 
The discussion of Indian education, as has been seen, centers, pre- 
dominantly around that of the native population. Up to this point 
general lines have been laid down which include all races and creeds 
without discrimination. But there is an element of the native popu-

mention must be made of it. This is the Mohammedan population 
of British India, which comprises (1917) 58,000,000 souls, or slightly 
less than one-fourth of the total. It is the only racial group whose 
adjustment to the uniform educational system of the country once 
seemed fraught with grave difficulties. But time has brought tact 
and understanding to the authorities in their dealings with the 
Mohamedans. Racial and religious barriers have been so broken 
down that in the Provinces showing the highest Mohamedan popula- 
tion—Bengal, the Punjab, the Northwest Frontier Province, and in 
some of the native administrations under British protection—the 
Mohammedans had proportionately a larger number of children in 
the lowest vernacular schools recognized by the Government than any 
other race. 
But there are certain difficulties still inherent in the situation. 
The Mohammedan religious authorities require the child to attend 
the Mosque before he does any other. This results in the Mohamme- 
dan boy’s commencing his regular schooling at a later age than the 
average. The alien languages to be learned, and the poverty of 
large sections of Mohammedan communities (where many converts 
are from the depressed classes) have worked to reduce the numbers 
in the higher standards of the primary vernacular schools mate- 
rially, to say nothing of those in the institutions of higher education. 
A further important element in the situation is the small number 
of Mohammedans engaged as teachers in the Government system. 
This is, among others, a result of the strict religious obligations 
laid by purely Mohammedan education upon its graduates to re- 
main faithful to Islamic teachings. Thus conditions for both teach- 
ers and pupils of Mohammedan faith are not favorable to the 
development of confidence in the Government schools. In Bengal 
the authorities have steadily endeavored to develop such confidence 
by special concessions to Mohammedans and the assignment of a 
large proportion of official posts to be filled by them. 
None of the measures indicated, however, has been recognized 
as adequately meeting the situation, and the authorities have re- 
peatedly authorized the Mohammedans to start their own schools 
under their own committees, with full facilities for religious in- 
struction and observance. Such schools are: (1)Those which teach 
the ordinary course of elementary subjects; (2) those which started 
as native schools but have modified the prescribed curriculum; and 
(3) those which are indifferent to government recognition and have 
their own scheme of studies. The number of Mohammedan schools 
"necessarily varies widely from Province to Province, secondary 
schools being specially well developed among them. In Bengal 
especially there is the unique combination of what are really middle
-P-A-G-E-227
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 227 
English schools with separate departments using Arabic as a medium 
of instruction and teaching Arabic literature. 
Three colleges are maintained by the Mohammedans, which mark 
a distinct advance in the reconciliation of the turbulent quarrels 
of the frontier tribes, many students being drawn from the non- 
Mohammedan population. There is an increasing demand for col- 
lege education among the Mohammedans in Bengal, and the next 
few years bid fair to see additional colleges initiated to meet this 
demand. 
To sum up the situation: The English educational officials are 
much encouraged by the marked increase in the number of Mo- 
hammedans resorting to the schools giving instruction along modern 
lines. Indeed, the number of Mohammedan pupils has steadily 
grown to be larger in proportion to the number of this group than 
those of all races and creeds together. The increase of Moham- 
medan pupils in the Government schools is a convincing proof that 
even among this stubborn group— 
the old prejudice against modern forms of thought and exclusive adherence 
to the orthodox subjects are dying away. Views are broadening. It is seen 
that instruction in special schools is often inferior—if only because the staff 
is inferior. * * * The special school that teaches unnecessary or useless 
subjects is waning in popularity. The cry is still for special institutions, but 
of the type that will fit the Musselman for the developments of modern life 
while yet keeping him a Musselman. 
EDUCATION OF EUROPEANS IN INDIA. . 
While the study of Indian education primarily concerns itself 
with instruction imparted to native children, who comprise the 
overwhelming majority of all school children throughout the Indian 
Empire, yet the education of the children and youth of European 
descent should not be overlooked. In the nature of things a different 
background of tradition and inheritance is possessed by the Euro- 
pean, and his children, no matter how humble or to what employ- 
ment destined, have essentially another outlook on life from that of 
the native, and in most instances children of European descent, 
whether pure or mixed, retain European habits and modes of life. 
As late ag the close of the past century social distinction brought 
about the result that children of English officials were sent to Eng- 
land in early infancy, there to be educated, or in the more healthful 
hill Provinces special schools were privately organized and main- 
tained for them. At the same time the children of the poorer Euro- 
peans and those of mixed blood were left to be educated largely by 
charity and in schools especially founded by private and religious 
benefactions.
-P-A-G-E-228
    228 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Of recent years not only has the European. population of the lead- 
ing Provinces of India increased exceedingly with the development of 
commerce and industries, but it has come to be recognized as the 
moral duty of an enlightened State to assume the instruction of all 
children whose domestic circumstances can not afford them adequate 
schooling. The original character of the schools for European chil- 
dren has, however, remained, and even where governmental grants 
are assigned it is usually to schools founded and managed on re- 
ligious and denominational lines. In return for the grant of aid the 
Government, does not always require a share in the management. 
The case of Bengal may be taken as representative. Out of 79 insti- 
tutions for the training of European children only 5 are managed by 
the Government; 15 are undenominational, most of them being 
schools maintained by the industrial corporations for the children 
of their employees; the remainder, 59, belong to various religious 
bodies. This denominational character, although the powerful fac- 
tor in the existence of such schools, has come to be regarded as 
leading to some waste of effort, and the Government has begun to 
encourage the consolidation of such schools wherever local condi- 
tions make it possible. Such schools are visited by a special inspector 
in each of the larger Provinces, but beyond good sanitary and health 
conditions no. very rigid requirements are exacted. 
In Provinces and districts where denominational and_ private 
schools have not been founded the Government has addressed itself 
seriously to the long-neglected question of the education of Euro- 
peans. Since the historic conference on this branch of education 
held at Simla in 1912, presided over by the governor of the Punjab, 
and including representatives of the various interests of European 
life in India, interest has steadily grown. The system of compul- 
sory education, of which the conference declared itself in favor, met 
surprising opposition from the local governments, the claim being 
made that the voluntary system of attendance was found to be 
working effectively. This, however, has been questioned by social 
workers in the large cities. Especially in the city of Madras the im- 
perial grant of 30,000 rupees for the extension of education among 
the poorer classes was gratefully welcomed in consideration of the 
undeniably large number of European children not reached. 
Separate European education naturally enrolls the overwhelming 
majority of its pupils in the primary stages. Embracing the middle 
school, 9, 10, and, in a few instances, 11 grades are offered, the sub- 
jects being practically the same as those taught in corresponding 
European schools. An interesting feature is that the second language 
required may be either Latin or a modern European language or an 
Indian vernacular. In regard to high-school work, the conference 
above referred to recommended for the high schools for boys a more
-P-A-G-E-229
    PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN INDIA. 229 
modern and practical curriculum with a few schools which should 
prepare boys for the universities and the professions and be called 
collegiate schools. The latter clause, however, owing to the disagree- 
ment of local governments and the Imperial Government of India, 
which thought the need amply met by practical training, was not 
put into execution. As a matter of fact the peculiar defect of Euro- 
pean governmental education in India is that it makes scant provi- 
sion for continuing the education of promising boys. A few en- 
deavor to go to England, and those unable to do this are admitted 
to the colleges for Indians, where they enjoy all advantages. Most 
of the directors report satisfactory progress in the European schools 
in their Provinces, and interest in this field is shown by the proposal 
for a training college for teachers in southern India. Methods and 
instruction are reported ag still improving, in spite of the losses of 
many teachers to military service. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
The broad distinction between the English and the vernacular 
schools is also carried out in the classification of teachers. Teachers 
trained in the English schools serve in secondary schools exclusively ; 
teachers trained in the vernacular institutions serve almost exclu- 
sively in primary schools but to some extent also ih secondary 
schools. The former class are trained according to English methods 
in the 15 special colleges and call for no further notice. The latter 
are of great importance in the system of Indian education, but their 
training lacks much of being what it should be. The Government of 
India has always been alive to the necessity of having a supply of 
teachers for primary schools adequate both in number and in attain- 
ments; but progress has been hampered in the many ways already 
shown in the treatment of primary education. 
In August, 1916, the Government of India issued a circular letter 
to local governments pointing out the inadequacy of the arrange- 
ments in many Provinces for the training of teachers for secondary 
and primary schools, and suggesting as a minimum standard that 
the number of teachers to be trained in each year should not be less 
than the number of new teachers who must be provided to take the 
place of those who have died or resigned or to meet the demands 
created by the extension of education. Since then considerable im- 
provements have been effected, but no improvement can be funda- 
11t is interesting to record that this problem was attempted in Madras, where a very 
progressive schedule of studies, allowing three alternative courses, has been introduced 
in the middle schools. The first was for pupils who did not-intend to pursue their edu- 
cation; the second prepared for the high school with studies leading to college and 
university; and the third prepared for business. Madras also has the credit of being 
the first to provide especial vocational and domestic economy training, an example 
which has since been followed by some of the schools in Bombay. \ 
   
-P-A-G-E-230
  
  230 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
mental unless the teacher’s profession is so elevated socially and 
financially as to attract an adequate number of candidates of the 
proper stamp. This has been attempted by increasing salaries, the 
effect of which has been to increase the numbers of the applicants 
in many Provinces, if not to elevate the quality. Of the approxi- 
mately 190,000 teachers of the vernacular, barely 60,000 are trained. 
The magnitude of the problem is serious. If the wastage of teach- 
ers of the vernacular be estimated at 6 per cent each year, the train- 
ing institutions should turn ‘out 12,000 teachers a year. But in 1917 
the number turned out was only a little below 9,000. Thus the nor- 
mal supply is not maintained, to say nothing of the increase necess- 
ary for extension. 
Students enrolled in the higher vernacular training institutions 
are required to have completed the middle course in the vernacular 
or Anglo-vernacular schools, and upon graduation they are certifi- 
cated to be teachers in secondary vernacular schools or to be head- 
masters of primary schools. These are the distinctive normal 
schools, their training extending over periods of from one to three 
years according to the Province concerned. Schools of a lower type 
are attended by students who have completed only the upper primary 
grades, and they offer shorter courses for the training of ordinary 
teachers in primary schools. 
It is the improvement in the students frequenting this latter class 
of schools that is the task of supreme importance in the training of 
teachers. The several Provinces differ in the attention bestowed 
upon the one or the other of the two lines of teacher training, and 
in the content and thoroughness of the courses offered. The prob- 
lem of improvement has been most. seriously attacked in the Province 
of Madras, where, as the report shows, modern methods are much 
needed : 
As regards the methods followed in the training schools, criticism and model 
lessons are generally suitably conducted. A weaker point in the training is 
the work in the practicing section. With the existing nuntbers it is difficult 
to give the students sufficient practical work, nor does it appear to be suffi- 
ciently recognized that the practical work done must be thoroughly supervised, 
scrutinized, and discussed with the students. The teaching of ‘the subjects of 
general education is variously reported upon. With their better staffs, the 
Government schools are better than the aided. Nature study seéms to be 
the weakest subject and garden work poor. * * * Criticisms are also 
heard of the teaching of geography and the vernacular. On the whole, how- 
ever, real progress appears to have been made. 
GENERAL CONCLUSION, 
In conclusion, the note of encouragement and optimism voiced in 
the reports of the several directors of public instruction seems justi- 
fied, and a net result of progress during the quinquennium is to be
-P-A-G-E-231

recorded despite the retrogression in certain districts and in certain 
branches of education which are inseparable from the economic and. 
other effects of the war. As Dr. Sharp summarizes the situation in 
his concluding paragraph upon the general progress of education in 
India: 
There is no denying the fact that while public interest in education has in- 
creased, public opinion so far as it is expressed often remains crude and un- 
formed. Press utterances are frequently actuated by vested interests or politi- 
cal motives. The criticism of measures of reform is attractive and the student 
community is a valuable political asset. * * * There is a tendency to lower 
standards and to oppose their improvement. Publicists support pupils in acts 
of indiscipline, openly blaming the teachers and deprecating punishment. 
« * * Below these manifestations there is a great body of sound public 
opinion. Nor is it always inarticulate. An important section of the press has, 
during the quinquennium, approached educational questions in the spirit of the 
educator. This is a hopeful sign. But before a thoroughly sound advance can 
be made it is essential that educational questions should be regarded on their 
own merits, that the teacher should come into his own and that due values 
should be set upon the respective merits of knowledge and of understanding. 
EDUCATION IN EGYPT! 
Egypt was declared a British protectorate on December 18, 1914. 
The ruler under the title of sultan, formerly khedive, and the Council 
of Ministers form the government. The authority of Great Britain 
is vested in the British Resident, the British advisers of each minis- 
try, and inspectors of the various departments in the 14 Provinces. 
Education is controlled by the Ministry of Education or the central 
authority and the councils, or the local authority for education. 
No close cooperation exists between these two kinds of bodies. The 
majority of the population is illiterate. According to the 1907 
census, 96 per cent were unable to read and write. At present only 
3 per cent of the population are attending elementary schools. A 
scheme is, however, under way which aims to establish efficient 
schools for at least 10 per cent of the population within the next 30 
years. The net expenditure of the Egyptian Government on educa- 
tion represents less than 2 per cent of the annual budget. This sum 
is intended primarily to cover the expenses of the Europeanized 
course of education designed to fit Egyptians for various branches 
of the public service and for professional careers. The education of 
the masses is intrusted to provincial councils or the local authorities, 
who make provision for elementary schools in their areas. 
BUDGET, 
The expenditure of the Ministry of Education for 1918-19 
amounts to $2,858,941, which is an increase of $548,216 over the esti-

mates of the preceding year, when the credits granted were lower by 
$186,727 than the prewar level of 1914-15. 
Education of Egypt is now clearly crystalizing into two systems: 
The Europeanized, which aims at providing education chiefly for 
the wealthier circles of society, and the vernacular, which aims at 
providing a practical education for the rest of the population. The 
Europeanized system is modern. The vernacular is old and indig- 
enous. The primary schools form the basis of the Europeanized 
system. 
INFANT CLASSES AND SCHOOLS. 
Infant classes are at present provided in girls’ primary schools 
only. As some knowledge of reading is required for entrance to 
primary schools, the ministry is making provision for the establish- 
ment of two infant schools for boys, one in Cairo and one in 
Alexandria.   PRIMARY SCHOOLS, 
The Ministry of Education at present maintains 30 boys’ primary 
schools, attended by 6,716 pupils. The provincial councils maintain 
27 boys’ primary schools, attended by 2,892 pupils, and give grants 
in aid to 14 private primary schools attended by 1,985 pupils. There 
are also 42 other private boys’ primary schools, attended by 7,999 
boy pupils, under the inspection of the Ministry of Education. 
The girls’ primary education is provided at present in three Gov- 
ernment primary girls’ schools, attended by 491 pupils. The pro- 
vincial councils maintain 10 primary schools attended by 993, and 
give grants in aid to two other schools with an attendance of 227. 
There are also under the inspection of the ministry 15 private 
girls’ schools, attended by 1,726 pupils. The Ministry of Educa- 
tion has thus under its control or under inspection 113 boys’ pri- 
mary schools attended by 19, 592 pupils and 30 girls’ primary schools, 
attended by 3,437 pupils. 
The staff in the primary schools is exclusively Egyptian, and all 
‘the instruction is given in Arabic. The curriculum comprises the 
ordinary elementary subjects. English is also taught. In girls’ 
schools stress is laid on training in domestic subjects (cooking, 
laundry, housewifery, and home hygiene). The course in boys’ 
schools lasts four years; in girls’ schools six, the first two years 
constituting infant classes. 
The instruction in the Government primary schools is not free, 
but some provision is made for necessitous children in the primary 
schools belonging to the provincial councils and private benevolent 
societies. 
The primary education certificate, formerly awarded upon the 
completion of the primary school, qualified the pupils for appoint- 
ment in the Government service. This attracted a large number of
-P-A-G-E-233
  EDUCATION IN EGYPT. 2383 
pupils who did not intend to pursue higher studies and were thus 
diverted from taking up a more practical course of studies. This 
defect was remedied in 1915 when the primary education certificate 
was abolished. In its stead was instituted an entrance examination 
for admission to secondary schools. By this reform the primary 
course lost its mark of self-completeness and came to be regarded 
as an initial stage of the Europeanized system. 
THE VERNACULAR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
The vernacular elementary schools, called maktabs, aim to meet 
the needs of the population at large. The course lasts four years, 
and, in addition to the ordinary elementary subjects, includes the 
study of the Koran and the tenets of Islam. In girls’ schools stress 
is laid on domestic science. The standard in maktab schools is far 
below that maintained in the primary schools. Improvements are 
being introduced gradually. In the Government and in a number 
of other maktabs, teachers are paid fixed salaries instead of being 
dependent on school fees. In some places, as for instance in Alex- 
andria, private maktabs are being bought out by a special com- 
mission and turned into municipal schools under the inspection of 
the ministry. At present the ministry maintains from its own budget 
two maktabs with 209 pupils and manages or inspects 4,263 maktabs 
attended by 282,063 pupils. 
HIGHER ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
These schools aim to supplement the meager education received in 
the maktab schools. There are at present 16 higher elementary schools 
attended by 742 boys and 226 girls. These schools are supported by 
the Ministry of Education and the provincial council. The boys’ 
higher elementary schools are of two types, urban and rural, with 
a four years’ course each. The rural schools offer, in addition to the 
usual literary subjects, lessons in rural science and native study, men- 
suration and surveying, and practical work in the school garden, as 
well as a certain amount of manual training. The urban schools 
have an industrial bias. The school schedule provides among 
other subjects for lessons on materials, machines, and manufactures, 
as well as for a large amount of manual training. These schools 
represent a new development in Egypt. The manual training is in- 
tended to be a means of mental training. The pupils, it is claimed, 
show great delight in manual work, and this reacts favorably on 
their book work. In order to facilitate the development of this new 
type of schools the fees have been considerably reduced. In the 
girls’ higher elementary schools the course is limited to three years. 
The instruction is practical, more than one-third of the time being 
devoted to domestic training (needlework, cookery, laundry work, 
housewifery, household accounts, and home hygiene).
-P-A-G-E-234
  234 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1915, 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Secondary schools are the product of the Europeanized system. 
The ministry maintains at present six secondary schools and ar- 
rangements are being made to open a seventh. The schools are 
attended by 2,442 pupils. There are also 28 private secondary schools, 
attended by 4,643 pupils. In 1913 the ministry inaugurated a 
system of grants in aid to private secondary schools. This had a 
marked effect in improving the equipment and efficiency of these 
schools. The ministry has thus under its control or under inspection 
84 secondary schools, attended by 7,085 pupils. There are at present 
no departmental secondary schools for girls, although the ministry 
is planning to create a girls’ high school for the children of the well- 
to-do classes. The secondary course for boys extends over four years, 
branching out at the end of the second year into two divisions, 
literary and scientific. The syllabus for the first two years comprises 
Arabic, English, history and geography, mathmematics, elementary 
physics and drawing, as well as physical training. In the third 
and fourth years, while the teaching of Arabic and English is con- 
tinued, pupils in the literary course begin the study of French and 
follow an extended course in history and geography, while pupils in 
the scientific course do not take up the study of a second foreign 
language but devote their time to extra work in mathematics, science, 
and drawing. The secondary examination is taken in two stages, 
Part I after the second year and Part II on the completion of the 
course. 
INTERMEDIATE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS. 
Admission to the intermediate technical schools is based on the 
primary course of study. The technical schools comprise the Bulak 
_ Technical School, the Intermediate School of Commerce, both in 
Cairo, and the Intermediate School of Agriculture at Mushtohor. 
The Bulak school has a four years’ course of study, the school of 
commerce and that of agriculture only three years. The Bulak 
Technical School is organized in three sections—building construc- 
tion, mechanical and electrical, and arts and crafts. The first two 
schools are under the department of technical education (a branch 
of the Ministry of Education); the last is under the Ministry of 
Agriculture. 
The Ministry of Education also maintains model workshops at 
Bulak, Mansura, and Assiut, which are attended by 743 pupils. In 
addition, the provincial councils maintain 12 trades schools, attended 
by 1,643 boys. There are also five trades schools, attended by 531 
boys and 156 girls, in the governorates. These nondepartmental 
trades schools receive grants in aid from the department of tech- 
nical education. The Ministry of Education also maintains one
-P-A-G-E-235
  EDUCATION IN EGYPT. 2385 
domestic school and inspects two private schools. Agricultural 
education is provided at nine agricultural schools, attended by 473 
boys. These schools receive grants in aid from the Ministry of 
Agriculture, which is responsible for the inspection of the schools. 
ELEMENTARY TRAINING COLLEGES FOR MEN AND WOMEN. 
Great progress has been made in recent years in the training of 
teachers, both men and women, for service in the maktabs. It was 
only in 1903 that the first elementary training college was estab- 
lished. At present, in addition to the two men’s training colleges 
and two women’s training colleges maintained by the Ministry of 
Education, there are in existence 13 training colleges for men and 
10 for women teachers, supported by the provincial councils. The 
four Government colleges are attended by 196 men and 896 women. 
No fees are charged, and in two women’s colleges the students are 
lodged and boarded free. The 23 provincial council colleges are 
attended by 1,059 men and 353 women. The Ministry of Educa- 
tion has thus under its control or inspection 27 elementary training 
colleges, attended by 1,255 men and 749 women. 
The elementary training college course extends over three years. 
The men’s colleges are at present recruited mainly direct from the 
maktabs, but also largely from the mosque schools; the women’s 
colleges are recruited direct from the maktabs. At present evening 
classes are held in the Bulak Elementary Training College for 
teachers in maktabs in order to improve their competence in kinder- 
garten methods and physical training. As the existing higher 
women’s college does not furnish a sufficient supply of teachers for . 
the women’s elementary training colleges and for the girls’ higher 
elementary schools, the ministry has found it necessary to provide 
some other source of supply. In 1917 it created a supplementary 
course in the Bulak Elementary Training College, 11 students re- 
maining to be trained as teachers of general subjects and 6 as domes- 
tic science teachers. The experiment having proved satisfactory, 
the ministry has now developed the scheme by extending the course 
to a second year. <A third section was added for the training of 
kindergarten teachers for the new infant schools and the infant 
classes in the girls’ primary schools. 
NASRIA TRAINING COLLEGE AND SCHOOL FOR CADIS. 
Apart from the University of Al Azhar and the other mosque 
schools, the Nasria Training College and the school for Cadis form 
the culmination of the vernacular system. 
The standard of admission to the Nasria Training College is 
very low. The college has now 318 students, all of whom receive 
their training free. The course extends over five years. Its special 
 
-P-A-G-E-236

purpose is to train sheiks as teachers of Arabic, the Koran, and 
tenets of Islam for service in the primary and secondary schools. 
The school for Cadis, which is under the Ministry of Justice, com- 
prises two sections, a lower section for training clerks and a higher 
section for training judges, both for service in the Moslem courts. 
The lower course occupies four years and the higher course five 
years. In addition to free education, the students receive a bursary. 
HIGHER COLLEGES. 
The higher colleges, based on the Europeanized system, include 
the School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy, the School of En- 
gineering, and the Sultania Training College under the Ministry 
of Education; the School of Law, under the Ministry of Justice; 
and the School of Agriculture and the Veterinary School, under the 
Ministry of Agriculture. 
The principal facts with reference to the various higher colleges 
are shown in the following tablé:   Courses and. students in the higher colleges.

Admission to the higher colleges is based upon the secondary edu- 
' cation certificate examination. For the School of Medicine and the 
School of Engineering the scientific secondary certificate is required, 
for the School of Law the literary certificate; the other colleges ad- 
mit students irrespective of whether the certificate is obtained on the 
scientific or literary side, though in the School of Agriculture and 
the Veterinary School preference is given to applicants possessing 
the scientific certificate. English is, in the main, the medium of in- 
struction in the higher colleges. 
In the Sultania Training College there are two sections, a literary, 
recruited from students with the literary certificate, for the training 
of teachers of history, geography, translation, etc.; and a scientific, 
admitting students with the scientific certificate, for the training of 
teachers of mathematics and science. These colleges admit boys 
only. 
THE SANIA TRAINING COLLEGE FOR GIRLS. 
This college forms an important phase in the development of fe- 
male education in Egypt. It is this college that is to supply women 
teachers not only for the girls’ primary schools but also for the
-P-A-G-E-237
  
  EDUCATION OF JEWS IN PALESTINE. 237 
women’s elementary training colleges and the girls’ higher elemen- 
tary schools. The regulations provide for a four years’ course. The 
Sania Training College at present contains 91 students, as compared 
with 77 in 1917 and 4 in 1900, when the college was founded. All 
the students are boarders, and no fees are charged. The standard of 
admission is low, but this will be remedied when a girls’ high school, 
which the ministry intends to open, comes into existence. 
A number of graduates of the higher colleges are sent to Europe 
for further studies. At present the Ministry of Education main- 
tains 83 such students, all of whom study in England. 
EDUCATION OF JEWS IN PALESTINE. 
By THeresa Bacu, 
Division of Foreign Educational Systems, Bureau of Education. 
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT. 
The recent revival of Hebrew education in Palestine culminated 
in the laying of the corner stone of the future Hebrew University in 
Jerusalem. It was the outgrowth of the Jewish national movement 
Imown under the name of Zionism. During the past few decades, 
and particularly during the years immediately preceding the war, a 
great revival of the Jewish spirit took place among the Jews in all 
the countries of the world. This is true particularly of Palestine, 
where the Jewish life began to shape itself along national lines. The 
Hebrew language was revived and became a living tongue. Hebrew 
literature sprang up, aspiring to take a place among the great litera- 
tures of the world. Hebrew writings were translated into modern 
languages. The masterpieces of English literature were rendered 
into Hebrew. Hebrew songs, newspapers, and textbooks were cur- 
rent. School children were instructed in Hebrew, despite the en- 
deavors of the Young Turks to make Turkish the principal lan- 
guage of the country, and in active opposition to the propaganda 
carried on by the German, French, and English schools established 
in the Holy Land. Notable among the foreign institutions were the 
schools of the Alliance Israélite and the Hilfsverein der Deutschen 
Juden, a French and a German organization, respectively. The 
former employed French as a language of instruction; the latter, 
German. Neither of these bodies had, however, sufficient compre- 
hension of the new life that was budding in Palestine. The policy 
pursued by the men in charge of foreign schools made it easy for 
the truly nationalistic schools to gain ground and supersede the 
older institutions. No foreign rivalry could crush the efforts of 
those who regarded Hebrew as the language of their own and strove 
to develop it in the land of its origin.

December 10, 1918, marks a new era in Hebrew education. That 
was the day when not only the language question but the whole 
policy of Jewish education in Palestine was definitely settled. 
The immediate cause of this turn of affaris was the decision of the 
German Hilfsverein with regard to the language of instruction in 
schools supported by that body. Contrary to its previous policy, 
the Hilfsverein began to neglect the study of Hebrew and pushed 
it more and more to the background. This caused much discontent 
among teachers and pupils nationalistically inclined. The climax 
was reached in December, 1918, when the Verein passed a resolu- 
tion to the effect that the language of instruction in the new Techni- 
cum at Haifa, then under construction, should be German. A 
general walkout in all the schools of the Verein followed, with the 
result that the best forces in the teaching staff went over to the 
Hebrew schools and helped in spreading the ancient culture of 
their own. The attitude of the pupils was no less remarkable. 
Over 50 per cent of the total number joined the national schools, 
where instruction was given in their own tongue. An immediate 
consequence of the Hilfsverein’s action was the creation of the 
educational committee, which sprang up in time of struggle. The 
aim of this committee was to establish order and cope with the 
situation created by the split. Its efforts were directed toward 
building up a school system truly representative of the best wishes 
of the people. New elementary schools were opened and conducted 
along modern lines in all the towns of Palestine. In Jerusalem, 
Jaffa, and Haifa, national schools replaced the old institutions 
maintained by private philanthropy, which were forced to close 
their doors. These new schools grew rapidly and attracted large 
sections of the population who had held aloof from the semi- 
Hebrew schools of the Hilfsverein. 
In agricultural colonies conditions differed. The colony schools, 
though subsidized from abroad, were not maintained by foreign 
organizations. They came into existence with the colonies them- 
selves and reflected the spirit that animated the settlers, At the 
outset of the war elementary schools existed in each of the 30 colo- 
nies of Palestine. The language of instruction in all these schools 
is Hebrew. The program of the colony schools comprises the usual 
elementary school subjects, in addition to lessons in religion, Bible, 
and Jewish history. Arabic is also taught, as knowledge of this 
language is indispensable in Palestine. In some of the colonies in- 
struction in French is given. This is due to the fact that many of 
the colonies were for some time under the control of the Jewish 
Colonization Association, a French institution which subsidized 
the schools. Fortunately, the subsidy carried with it no interference 
in the internal management of the schools. This was left entirely
-P-A-G-E-239
EDUCATION OF JEWS IN PALESTINE. 239 
to the colonists. The colony schools sprang up independently of 
one another and differed widely in method and character. Some 
had only elementary classes, others with a larger school population 
had a well-equipped elementary school, with eight classes and a 
kindergarten attached to it. Of recent years the teachers’ associa- 
tion, which performs the function of a board of education, set a 
certain standard for these schools. This body appoints teachers 
for the colony schools and furthers educational development by 
publishing Hebrew textbooks and a Hebrew educational periodical, 
Ha-Chinnuch. It is noteworthy that all national Hebrew schools 
have been organized and conducted by a local committee of parents 
and teachers. This committee drafts the program of the school, 
subject to the approval of the Hebrew Teachers’ Association. 
Schools of the elementary type are the only schools in agricultural 
colonies. The colonies, though growing rapidly, were not large 
enough to provide for secondary instruction. This was introduced 
in the two large cities, Jaffa and Jerusalem. Though not directly 
founded by the Zionist organization, the secondary schools are the 
product of the Zionist spirit. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, 
The gymnasium in Jaffa, as the secondary school is called, has 
four preparatory and eight regular classes. After the fifth year 
the curriculum branches off into the classical and the so-called 
“veal” course. The program of the gymnasium includes, in addi- 
tion to the ordinary high-school program, the study of the Bible, 
the Talmud, Turkish, and Arabic. Emphasis is laid on gym- 
nastics and the excursions which form an important item in all the 
national schools. The rapid development of the Hebrew high 
school in Jaffa is graphically described by Dr. Mossinsohn, one of 
its leaders and inspirers, in the Menorah Journal, December, 1918. 
Opened in 1906 with 17 pupils and 4 teachers, it grew so rapidly 
that in the latter part of 1914 it enrolled 900 pupils and 30 teachers. 
The curriculum is given in Hebrew exclusively, and the diplomas 
of the school are recognized by most of the American and foreign 
universities. In the last few years the popularity of the school 
was so great that it was almost entirely sustained by the income 
derived from tuition, The gymnasium in Jerusalem, organized in 
1908 and patterned after that in Jaffa, had a somewhat slower de- 
velopment. Both high schools are coeducational. Important from 
the point of view of a national system of education was the estab- 
lishment of a school for kindergartners with a three-year course in 
Jerusalem and a technical high school at Haifa. Both were opened 
in 1914 by the educational committee, as a result of the controversy 
with the Hilfsverein. The Haifa school was opened in place of  
-P-A-G-E-240
240 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
the proposed Technicum. It is coeducational and aims to give stu- 
dents a technical training. The original idea of building a higher 
technical institution in Palestine has not been abandoned. Those 
interested in the project hope to realize it as soon as an opportune 
moment presents itself. There are, of course, in Palestine a num- 
ber of Jewish schools with a decidedly religious bias. These 
schools are orthodox in spirit and hostile to modern innovations. 
Their chief aim is to foster the Jewish religion and to keep it intact 
from foreign influences. 
Of special schools the musical conservatories, called: Shulammith 
schools, in Jaffa and Jerusalem deserve mention. These schools 
have contributed greatly to the revival of Jewish music by arranging 
concerts and issuing collections of old and new songs. An important 
national school for the promotion of Jewish art is the Bezalel School 
of Arts and Crafts, founded by the artist Boris Schatz. The subjects 
taught in the school are carpet weaving, filagree silver work, carving, 
lithography, lace making, etc. 
AGRICULTURAL TRAINING. 
The provision for agricultural training, so important for the col- 
onies, is wholly inadequate. The Mikveh Israel Agricultural School, 
established in 1870 by the Alliance Israélite Universelle, near Jaffa, 
has an annual budget of about $10,000. The language of instruction 
is French, the course of study lasts four years, and the curriculum 
is intended to turn out professional agronomists, who seek positions 
as inspectors, supervisors, landscape gardeners, and teachers at other 
schools. As there is no field for these agronomists in Palestine, 
many graduates go into other callings or leave the country. The 
Petach-Tikvah Agricultural School, established in 1912, has a very 
ambitious four years’ program which includes Hebrew, French, 
Arabic, mathematics, history, geography, chemistry, botany, physics, 
surveying, meteorology, zoology, geology, and mineralogy; soil 
chemistry, the installing of plantations, cattle raising, medicine, 
dairying, plant pathology, administration of farms, agrarian law, 
commercial law, etc. To practical work only two hours a week are 
assigned. Thus neither the old Mikveh Israel School nor the more 
recent Petach-Tikvah Agricultural School has succeeded in work- 
ing out a program suited for the colonies. A unique undertaking is 
the farm school for girls at Kinneret, near the sea of Tiberias, sup- 
ported by a Jewish women’s organization. Candidates must be at 
least 17 years old. The pupils enjoy free tuition, board and lodging, 
as well as a monthly stipend. The work is predominantly practical, 
the pupils being occupied from seven to nine hours daily. The sub- 
jects taught in the first year are botany, elementary chemistry and 
physics, cooking and preserving, and in the second the elements of
-P-A-G-E-241
EDUCATION OF JEWS IN PALESTINE. 241 
scientific agriculture, fertilizing methods, plant diseases, the prin- 
ciples underlying various crops, poultry raising, cattle breeding, and 
the care of dairy products. The school has for its use 16 acres of 
Jand for ornamental gardening, forestry, and a barnyard. All the 
work of the farm is done by the pupils, also the sewing and cooking 
required for the institution. 
This was in brief the state of Hebrew education in Palestine be- 
fore the war broke out. The effects of the war were in many in- 
stances disastrous for the newly established school system. Schools 
were turned.into hospitals, teachers were banished, funds failed 
to arrive, and pupils were driven from place to place. Yet there 
was a dogged determination to keep the schools open at any cost. 
This often necessitated the feeding and care of children. When 
the population was banished from their own homes, schools were 
opened in the refugee camps. At present a Zionist board of edu- 
cation administers the national schools in Palestine and subsidizes 
all Jewish schools on two conditions: That Hebrew be the language 
of instruction and that there be a certain standard of hygiene and 
sanitation. Funds are supplied from abroad. 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A UNIVERSITY. 
Every effort is made to organize a unified national Hebrew school 
system headed by a Hebrew university, where Jewish culture may 
thrive freely. A higher educational institution is thus far lacking, 
though Zionists and other Jewish circles have dreamed of such an 
institution for a number of years. When Russian universities closed 
their doors to thousands of Jewish students, these were compelled 
to seek higher education in foreign countries. Many went to Swiss, 
others to German and French universities. It was then proposed 
to build a university for Jewish young men and women. But opin- 
ions differed. Some chose Switzerland as the land where such a 
university could flourish. Others who had a definite aim in view 
and looked forward to the revival of the Jewish culture pointed to 
Palestine as an appropriate center. Things were unsettled when in 
July, 1913, negotiations were begun for the purchase of a site in Pal- 
estine, but these were necessarily suspended when the war broke out. 
The declaration of the British Government of November 2, 1917, 
on behalf of the Jewish home in Palestine gave new impetus to the 
movement and spurred the Zionists to renewed educational activi- 
ties. Their efforts have been crowned with success. Palestine is 
to have a Hebrew university. In March, 1918, a Zionist commis- 
sion headed by Dr. Weizmann was sent to the Holy Land under 
the auspices of the British Government. The object of this com- 
mission was, among other things, “To inquire into the feasibility 
of the scheme of establishing a Jewish university.” The inquiry

242 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
proved so satisfactory that a few months later, i. e., on July 24, 
1918, the commission found it advisable to take the initial steps 
in laying the corner stones of the future university. Representa- 
tives of the Christian, Moslem, and Jewish creeds were present 
at the ceremony, and thus emphasized the cultural value of a higher 
institution in Palestine. In his speech. delivered at the laying of 
the foundation stones, Dr. Weizmann has defined the new institu- 
tion as a “Hebrew university,” for he continues, “I do not suppose 
that there is anyone here who can conceive of a university in Jeru- 
salem being other than Hebrew.” Speaking further of the pro- 
gram, he thus defines it: 
I have spoken of a Hebrew university where the language will be Hebrew, 
just as French is used at the Sorbonne or English at Oxford. Naturally other 
languages, ancient and modern, will be taught in their respective faculties. 
Amongst these we may expect that prominent attention will be given to 
Arabic and other Semitic languages. A Hebrew university, though intended 
primarily for Jews, will, of course, give affectionate welcome to the members of 
every race and every creed. ‘My house is a house of prayer for all nations.” 
Besides the usual schools and institutions which go to form a modern uni- 
versity, it will be peculiarly appropriate to associate with our Hebrew uni- 
versity archeological research, which has revealed so much of the mysterious 
past of Hgypt and of Greece and has a harvest still to be reaped in Pales- 
tine. Our university is destined to play an important part in this field of 
knowledge. Side by side with scientific research the humanities will occupy a 
distinguished place. 
In conclusion Dr. Weizmann pointed out that the Hebrew uni- 
versity, while devoting its activities to the higher scientific achieve- 
ments, will— 
at the same time be rendered accessible to all classes of the people. The 
Jewish workman and farm laborer must be enabled to find there a possibility 
of continuing his education ine his free hours; the doors of our libraries, 
lecture rooms, and laboratories must be opened wide to all. Thus the uni- 
versity will exercise its beneficial influence on the nations as a whole. 
Before the political structure of a new nation that is yet old 
had time to grow, before the foundation of such a structure could be 
laid or even conceived under existing conditions, there looms thus 
from the distant Orient a spiritual creation of the Jews, a creation 
that promises to take a prominent place alongside the great insti- 
tutions of learning in our own and in other countries.

CHAPTER III. 
EDUCATION IN FRANCE IN 1916-1918 
By I. L. Kanvet. 
ContTrents.—Administration—Physical welfare—Elementary education—Secondary educa- 
tion of girls—Secondary education of boys. 
The war has affected the conduct of education in France perhaps 
more than in either England or Germany. For the first two years 
the demands at the front tended to subordinate all other thought and 
activities to the one great purpose. More recently the educational 
literature of France indicatés that the war has had the effect-of 
provoking considerable questioning and dissatisfaction with the 
existing systems of education. Radical changes have not yet taken 
place in educational administration or organization, but the ground 
is being prepared by discussions and conferences, by public and 
private commissions of inquiry, by articles in the daily press for the 
reforms that it is now generally felt must come after the war. The 
schools will be called upon to play an important part in the restora- 
tion of the country and must, in the opinion of many, be improved 
to meet the new demands. 
While the war has strengthened the universal conviction that the 
principles of French democracy and the basic French institutions 
are sound, it has none the less directed increased attention to the 
need of widening educational opportunities and the general scope of 
the school. The proposals for the better administration of school 
attendance, and for compulsory attendance at continuation schools, 
the reform of the examination for the certificat d’études primaires, 
the consideration of the reform of the higher elementary school, and 
the urgent demand for greater opportunities for higher education as 
well as its reform are all comprised in the present tendency. Within 
the school there is a demand that instruction be less academic and 
bookish and more adapted to local circumstances and modern needs 
in general. 
As in other countries there are those who would convert every 
school into a technical or vocational school. This problem is well 
summarized in the following statement: 
The present problem is that of reconciling two cultures—the humanistic and 
practical, What shall be the relations in the elementary schools between in- 
243
-P-A-G-E-244
  944 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
struction and local conditions? What in the higher elementary schools or in 
the technical schools shall be the relations between general education and 
vocational training? In secondary education what shall be the relations be- 
tween classical culture and preparation for modern life, and in higher educa- 
tion between pure and applied science? Is not the problem the same every- 
where? 1 
The answer to this statement is that the principle of balance, the 
principle upon which the Republic is founded, will offer a solution 
here too. 
A balance between science and letters, between authority and liberty, be- 
tween discipline and initiative; a balance attained with wisdom and modera- 
tion, with tolerance and humanity, with finesse and good sense; a balance so 
conforming to the liberal ideas maintained by the defenders of civilization 
that it will suffice for us to establish it in instruction so that it may become 
adapted to the demands of modern society and definitely serve the interests 
of the country.” 
While one tendency is represented by those who desire to retain the 
present organization provided it is reformed to a considerable de- 
gree, there is a still more marked tendency, as is indicated below, to 
demand a thorough reorganization of the educational system. Ac- 
cording to this view, represented by a number of teachers grouped to- 
gether as Les Compagnons and attracting considerable attention in 
the country, the problem is no longer merely one of pedagogy or of 
internal reform. “This is a moment when the whole country feels 
too strongly the need of a general reconstruction, of reform in ad- 
ministration, politics, economics, industry, etc., for one to confine 
oneself strictly to the field of pedagogy.” ? 
The authors accordingly advocate not a reform of the disparate 
parts of the system, but a reorganization of the whole system based 
on one point of view. They advocate a common school (école 
unique), upon which can be built up on one side the humanistic, on 
the other vocational courses. This should be the national type, 
whether in public or private schools. The elementary school should 
be the portal for all, but opportunity should be offered to all to 
advance as far as their ability warrants. 
ADMINISTRATION* 
There appears to be a marked feeling that the need for the reform 
of administration, organization, curricula, and methods of instruc- 
tion is one of the most pressing problems of the present time. The

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE IN 1916-1918. 245 
charge is made that the administrative machinery of French educa- 
tion no: longer meets the requirements and demands of modern educa- 
tion.t The present situation has developed partly out of the exist- 
ence, side by side and without coordination, of different branches of 
education, some under the control of the ministry of public instruc- 
tion and fine arts, others distributed among other ministries, partly 
out of the practice of piecemeal reforms and reorganizations. Re- 
form at this hour, it is urged, must be based on a consideration of 
the needs of the country as a whole and of the functions of education 
in general. Peace will bring a well-defined task, for which half 
measures will be inadequate. The whole national structure of edu- 
cation must be reorganized from the elementary school up.? The de- 
mand for reorganization and reconstruction in industry, commerce, 
agriculture, politics, and social life can not be met without the one 
reform on which these all depend—the reform of national education. 
Only through such a reform—the conservation and training of its 
human capital—can France reap the benefit of her great material and 
spiritual resources. 
The chief administrative change that is considered desirable is one 
that will abolish the extreme form of centralization that character- 
izes the system. If the needs of the nation and the different localities 
are to be met, some flexibility must be introduced in educational 
administration,‘ and provision must be made for the cooperation of 
various economic and industrial interests, as already proposed in 
1911 by M. Steeg. The present system inevitably leads to adminis- 
tration through official documents and correspondence rather than 
by direct personal supervision. The future requires the grant of 
larger liberty to local authorities. At present the powers of the local 
authorities in education are almost negligible, and many of the local 
school committees (commissions scolaires) contemplated by the law 
have ceased to function.? Any increase in local freedom must be 
extended to the teachers, who should feel at liberty to adapt their 
work to local needs within certain well-defined minimum require- 
ments and standards. 
One writer sums up these suggestions as follows: “There will not be the 
same uniformity among the schools of different departments or among diverse 
communes of the same department; but what does such uniformity, created 
artificially and externally by the State laws, matter, if there is an internal 
harmony, if each school obeys the rhythm of the life about it?” *®

246 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Concrete proposals for the development of a system of adminis- 
tration to give effect to these tendencies have not yet been put for- 
ward to any extent. It is suggested that the conseil superieur de 
instruction publique can be brought more closely into touch with 
the currents of national thought by the inclusion of women and of 
representatives of employers and employees from the fields of in- 
dustry, commerce, and agriculture. 
PHYSICAL WELFARE. 
It was perhaps to be expected that France would be influenced 
as a consequence of the close contact with the British and American 
forces, just as it may be expected the French intellectual influences 
will affect British and American thought in time. A widespread 
movement has begun for the improvement and extension of physical 
education and games throughout the country, not merely to develop 
agility and endurance in the individual, but to strengthen the Nation 
asa whole. The recently reformed examination for the certificate of 
primary studies includes a gymnastic exercise. Associated with this 
movement is the recognition that more attention must be given to 
medical inspection and treatment of children of school age and pre- 
school age. The American Red Oross has aroused considerable in- 
terest, as, for example, in Lyon, by distribution of leaflets and ex- 
hibits on the physical care and welfare of children. Early in 1917 
a commission was appointed to study the reorganization of physical 
training in the schools. 
In April, 1918, the ministry of public instruction issued a circular 
to the rectors of the academies urging the development of physical 
education, games and athletic sports in secondary, normal, and 
higher elementary schools. It is pointed out that such training 
could be organized without encroaching on class work. School prin- 
cipals and teachers are asked to encourage the establishment of clubs 
under their general supervision and with the assistance of advisory 
committees representing the public and alumni associations. From 
another point of view, school athletics are advocated as a center for 
cooperation between parents, teachers, physicians, and pupils.” 
La Ligue frangaise pour l’hygiéne scolaire is actively promoting the 
introduction of open-air exercise, in which teachers should also par- 
ticipate, and is advocating the introduction of school medical inspec- 
tion and the keeping of records of physical development. A Union des 
sociétés frangaises de sports athlétiques has been established to pro- 
mote the development of school athletic clubs and to secure playing 
fields. It is suggested in the circular that participation should not

be made compulsory and that no boy be allowed to take part without 
the written consent of his parents, so that the State might be relieved 
of responsibility for accident. The union has made advantageous 
terms with insurance companies to furnish compensation in cases of 
accident.t 
The further development of the movement is indicated in the 
following account of some propaganda that has already been under- 
taken :? 
In the course of a recent manifestation in favor of physical education, 
organized at Bordeaux, M. Henry Pate, deputy, delivered a very interesting 
address, in which he stated that he and some of his colleagues in the house of 
deputies had decided to participate actively in the physical education and 
athletics of the young, in accordance with the following program: (1) To 
adopt a general method of rational physical instruction, based on a knowledge 
of the physical needs of the subject, the specialization of the work, and the 
attraction of the exercise. (2) To create regional schools and a superior school 
destined to create and to maintain a unity of methods. (3) To open these 
schools to the physical instructors of the army, to the monitors of the prepara- 
tion for military service, and to the instructors of both sexes. (4) To direct 
the young toward outdoor exercises, giving them freely. (6) To obtain (a) 
the simplification of school programs, which are frightfully overloaded and 
tend to destroy energy; (0) the introduction of a physical test in all examina- 
tions; (c) the institution of outdoor schools and open-air or outdoor colonies 
for the physically abnormal children; and (d) the complete reorganization of 
school medical inspection. (7) To assure the employment of special professors 
of gymnastics. (8) To demand legislation providing for obligatory post-gradu- 
ate instruction and the introduction of the eight-hour day (la semaine an- 
glaise), so as not to injure the vocational work of the adults, or their apprentice- 
ship, or reduce the wages to which they may aspire. (9) To give a larger 
place in the training for military service to physical education and athletics, 
as a base for the future reorganization of the army, and of the recruiting 
laws. 
In order to solve these multiple problems, there has been appointed a comité 
national de propagande pour le développement de l’éducation physique et spor- 
tive, de hygiéne sociale et de la rénovation de la race. This committee will 
cooperate closely with’ the public authorities, the universities, the faculties, the 
commercial centers, industrial centers, financial powers, and the press. 
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION. 
The most pressing problems in the field of elementary education 
are the improvement of school attendance, adaptation of the work 
of the school to local environment, and better articulation with 
higher schools. The withdrawal of adult workers affected French 
agriculture and industry seriously, and until better adjustments

between the needs of the army and the needs of industries were made, 
the immediate result was a marked increase of child labor with a 
consequent effect on school attendance. This condition was already 
marked and subjected to criticism before the war; the law of 1882 
permits the exemption of children from school attendance for three 
months of the year if they are assisting parents in harvesting, potato 
gathering, fruit picking, and other agricultural pursuits, and for one 
school session out of two if they are working for another employer. 
A ministerial circular? issued on October 1, 1917, urges that better 
efforts be made to improve school attendance and indicates that 
restrictions would be introduced officially. The preparation of the 
next generation and the great task awaiting it require that children 
should enjoy a longer education. To this end it is pointed out that 
the teachers, who have gained considerable prestige during the war, 
can contribute much by cooperating with the home. The suggestion 
is also made that municipal authorities might make the grant of 
clothing, food, and other assistance to school children dependent on 
their regular attendance. 
The curriculum of the elementary school suffers too much from 
uniformity and continues, as in many other educational systems, to be 
too bookish. Says P. Crouzet, Inspecteur de l’Académie de Paris: 
We are too confident that knowledge is power. We study to know instead 
of studying to live better.... The educational problem of to-morrow is 
not to extend or change the knowledge or to extend or modify the programs 
so much as to direct knowledge of life, to teach everything, not in terms of the 
past but of the present and future.’ 
Although the regulations permit adaptation to local industrial and 
agricultural needs, very little appears to have been done to make this 
permission effectual. It is urged that instruction in the elementary 
school should be made more real and practical, not merely by the 
effective introduction of manual work for boys and household arts 
for girls, and school gardens for both, but by vitalizing the curricu- 
lum by reference to the environment with which the pupils are 
familiar. Such a reform, it is admitted, will demand more teachers 
of good training who can make the best use of the responsibility 
that should be theirs. In country areas it is recommended that prin- 
cipals be appointed to supervise a number of teachers and schools. 
It is felt that the new education for responsibility and liberty, that 
are fundamental to modern democracy, can not be developed under 
the existing pressure of uniformity.*

EDUCATION IN FRANCE IN 1916-1918, 249 
In 1917 the Conseil supérieur de l’instruction publique voted to 
reform the examination for the certificate of elementary studies 
(certificat d’études primaires). This vote was followed by a minis- 
terial decree on July 19, 1917, giving the details of the reform and by 
another on March 9, 1918, giving instructions to the rectors of 
academies on the conduct of the examinations. The purpose of the 
reform is to meet some of the criticisms that the work of the ele- 
mentary school is too bookish, emphasises memory work, and neglects 
subjects not required in the examinations. The reform aims to secure 
a place for every subject in the curriculum commensurate with its 
importance, to develop uniformity of standards, and to encourage the 
development of judgment, intelligence, and will. The examination 
is to be conducted by commissions appointed by the academy rectors 
and is to be based on the work of the cours moyen, usually completed 
at the age of 11 or 12. The examination is in two parts. The first 
includes an essay on a simple topic, dictation, and questions on the 
text, problems in practical arithmetic and the metric system; a com- 
position or some questions in history and geography or everyday 
science, and for boys an exercise in linear drawing or handwork, and 
for girls a test in sewing or design. The second part consists of 
questions in history and géography or science, a test in reading and 
simple questions on the text, recitation of a piece of poetry or singing 
at the pupil’s option, a test in mental arithmetic, and a simple gym- 
nastic exercise. 
A similar reform of the examinations at the close of the higher 
elementary schools is also contemplated, but for the present is post- 
poned until these schools undergo a contemplated revision On August 
8, 1918, a circular was issued by the minister of public instruction* 
directing the attention of teachers and inspectors to the need of pro- 
moting continued full-time education by improving instruction of 
pupils from the ages of 12 to 15. The circular proposes that confer- 
ences be conducted to consider the revision of the cours supérieur and 
the cours complémentaires. The following questions are proposed 
for discussion, with the suggestion that the replies be sent to the 
ministry in December, 1918: 
The number of advanced courses in each canton and their adequacy? How 
to create new courses? 
What should be their programs? What place should be given to vocational 
education? 
Should there be a special examination leading to a sanction? 
What can the elementary schools do to improve the work offered to older 
pupils of 13 and 14? Can not these schools combine general education and 
preapprenticeship instruction?

250 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
The importance of the problem, which is, of course, closely asso- 
ciated with the proposals for compulsory continuation school attend- 
ance, is emphasized: 
The more the ruin and losses increase, the greater must be the service of 
national education. The end to be attained is two-fold—to stimulate, by 
means of the cours supérieurs and complémentaires and other schools offering 
the opportunity, the development of the pupils; and by the cours de perfection- 
nement to furnish the whoie people with the means of increasing their moral 
strength, intellectual vigor, and economic productivity. 
To repair the ruins of France in men and material caused by the 
war, the urgent need will be to discover ability wherever it can be 
found. The burden will, therefore, be placed on those intrusted 
with the administration not only to select pupils in the elementary 
schools who show ability to proceed further, but to articulate the 
different types of schools in such a way that each boy or girl will 
secure the training most suitable. This task will not only involve 
selection of pupils for advancement, but the creation of new types of 
schools adequately differentiated to meet the different abilities of the 
pupils and the diverse needs of the country. At present the only 
opportunity of which the elementary school pupils are able to avail 
themselves is to pass on to the higher elementary school. The doors 
of the secondary schools were thrown open to them in 1902, but very 
few take advantage of this opportunity in spite of the existence of 
scholarships.1 That an elementary education is not sufficient equip- 
ment for life has been recognized universally,? and with the end in 
view of increasing educational opportunities compulsory attendance 
at continuation schools has been proposed. For the more able, how- 
ever, the development of trade and technical schools and a reorgani- 
zation of secondary education along modern lines are advocated. 
To enable the poor pupil of parts to continue his education as far 
as possible it is urged not only that scholarships should be offered, 
but that maintenance grants be given and allowances to parents to 
compensate them for loss of wages. The proposals for the reorgani- 
zation of secondary education are made largely with importance of 
articulation in mind,* while the better adjustment of the elementary 
schools to vocational preparation is also receiving considerable atten- 
tion. These points of view merely indicate that the elementary 
school can not be organized without reference to the broader needs 
of the nation.*

  EDUCATION IN FRANCE IN 1916-1918. 251 
The project for a continuation school law to which reference was 
made in the last report of the Commissioner of Education has not 
yet been passed, but seems to be exercising some influence already. 
At Corbie the local manufacturers have posted notices to the effect 
that they would employ young persons leaving the elementary schools 
with the certificate of studies, and allow them to attend the local 
higher primary school for three years, providing tuition, books, 
apparatus, and even maintenance grants. On leaving these schools 
the pupils would enter the factories as apprentices for two or three 
years, during which they would continue to attend school three 
times a week for general and technical instruction during working 
hours and without loss of pay. The abler among them would be 
sent on to schools of arts and crafts, receiving maintenance allow- 
ances and tuition during their period of study. The parents would 
be under no obligation to the employers except to permit them to 
control the educational progress of the young employees, so. that 
“they may become active, hardy, enterprising, and proud of their 
country.”* 
SECONDARY EDUCATION OF GIRLS. 
The changes brought about by the war in the position of women 
have made the reorganization of secondary education of girls a ques- 
tion of vital importance. Asin other countries women have taken the 
place of men in every walk of life, and have proved themselves equal 
to most tasks, but the change in the social tradition has been more 
revolutionary in France than elsewhere. It is recognized that not 
only the professions but positions of leadership in commerce and in- 
dustry must in the future be opened to women on an equal footing 
with men. Women have been admitted for some time to the practice 
of law and medicine, and new careers are constantly being made ac- 
cessible to them. In the field of commerce where women are expected. 
to find considerable scope in the future the Chamber of Commerce 
of Paris has opened the Ecole commerciale des jeunes filles which 
will give a three-year course, including preparation not merely for 
subordinate clerical positions but for the more important work of 
management. The Ecole pratique de haute enseignement commercial 
pour les jeunes filles at the Conservatoire des arts et métiers in Paris

offers similar opportunities. Schools and institutions hitherto re- 
stricted to men have now opened their doors to women. These in- 
clude the Ecole centrale des arts et manufactures, the Institut 
agronomique, the Ecole de I’ horlogerie, and the Ecole de physique.+ 
These developments have led to a demand for reform of the system 
of secondary education, which as organized under the law of 1882 is ‘ 
adapted chiefly for girls of the wealthy middle classes who do not 
expect to enter a profession or career of any kind, but desire a general 
education, leading to a dipléme de fin a’ études, which, however, has 
no official value. 
Private schools, however, offered facilities for the preparation of 
girls for the baccalaureate, while in a few cases some schools for boys 
admitted girls for advanced work. The proposals take the form of a 
demand either for secondary education of the same type as that for 
boys or a new and extended organization of the existing system. The 
objection to the first suggestion is that the basis of the lyceés and the 
colleges for boys is not sufficiently broad and that the majority of 
girls at present do not desire a preparation that leads only to the 
universities and professions. It is also felt that while the secondary 
schools for boys are being subjected to criticism and discussion, it 
would not be advisable to copy them.? The difficulty in the way of 
the second proposal is the national tradition of privileges, certificates, 
and examinations which mark the end of a school course. A third 
suggestion, that a new section of the examination for the baccalau- 
reate be created, is rejected as introducing too much differentiation 
and leading as a consequence to much confusion, while its establish- 
ment would probably have the effect of ousting or lowering the 
standard of the present diploma. The problem involves, therefore, 
not so much the reorganization of girls’ schools as the nature of the 
educational and other privileges (sanctions) to which it will lead. 
In December, 1916, a Project relatif 4 l’enseignement secondaire des 
jeunes filles was presented to the Conseil supérieur de l’instruction 
publique, in which it was pointed out that any radical change in the 
system of secondary education of girls would require parliamentary 
action. The plan presented in the projet was based on the existing 
organization in the expectation that the reform could be effected by 
administrative machinery. The problem was to bring the dipléme 
de fin d’études into harmony with modern needs and to give it a 
value equal to that of the baccalaureat. The projet recommends the 
beginning of secondary education at the age of 11 instead of 12, as 
under the present system, thus extending the existing course to six 
instead of five years. The course is still to be divided into two

parts—one of four years closing with the certificat d’études sec- 
ondaires, and the other two years culminating in an examination for 
the dipléme de fin d’études. Except for those students who desire to 
take the baccalauréat with Latin the work is to be the same for all 
and is to include morals and psychology, French langauge and litera- 
ture, modern languages, history, geography, mathematics and 
science, drawing, and gymnastics. It is suggested that a seventh 
year be added for those who desire to study for the second part of 
the baccalauréat or to continue a special general and cultural course 
or to prepare for any of the new careers open for women in adminis- 
tration, commerce, finance, industry, and the civil services. 
It was thought by the framers of the projet, who claimed to have 
canvassed teachers and associations of parents, that by this plan the 
diploma could be given the same sanction as the baccalauréat and 
that with some modifications those who desired could specialize for 
the Latin or science sections. The introduction of the projet was 
‘opposed, however, as illegal unless passed by parliament. It was 
urged that the conseil supérieur could not introduce it as an admin- 
istrative measure. Accordingly, the minister of public instruction, 
M. Viviani, at the close of 1916, established a commission to inquire 
into the modifications needed in the organization of studies and 
privileges for the secondary education of girls.t 
M. Camille See,? the author of the law of December 21, 1880, in 
his evidence before this commission on January 19, 1918, pointed 
out that the original intention of the law was a secondary school 
for girls giving a seven-year course, divided into two cycles of four 
and three years, respectively, and leading to the diploma of second- 
ary studies. The fundamental course was to be so organized that 
by the addition of elective subjects pupils would have been able to 
enjoy the same curricula as those offered since 1902 in the boys’ 
schools. He mentioned that he had also advocated in 1878 the 
establishment of technical courses leading to scientific institutions. 
The present proposals, in his opinion, only represented a return to 
the spirit of the law of 1880, which had been overridden by an 
administrative regulation of January 14, 1882. 
The commission issued a questionnaire, covering the following 
topics, to educational authorities and parents’ associations: 
Should the education of girls bear a distinctive character in organization 
and curriculum? 
What amount of time should be given, consistent with the requirements of 
health, to intellectual studies?

What modifications are needed in the curriculum? Should room be found for 
domestic science, hygiene, and physical and practical technical training? 
Should the dipléme de fin d’études be retained or changed, and what should 
be its relation to the baccalaureate? 
When, if at all, should Latin be begun? 
A subcommittee of the commission drew up a number of recom- 
mendations which are now being considered by all the members. 
The chief recommendations are as follows:* 
1. The education of girls needs a new organization and appropriate program 
of studies, 
2. The schools shall be organized in two cycles, the first of four years, the 
second of two. The course shall begin at the age of 12. 
3. In the first cycle the school day shall be of four hours; in the second 
cycle of five hours. 
4. Fourteen hours a week shall be given to compulsory subjects in the first 
cycle; 17 hours in the second. 
5, An important and compulsory place shall be given to studies appropriate 
for girls (household arts and hygiene), practical work, and physical training. 
6. The six years’ course shall be brought to a conclusion in an examination 
on the work of the last year, leading to a dipléme de fin d’études, equivalent to 
the first part of the baccalaureate. 
7. As many careers as possible shall be open to girls holding this diploma. 
One of the burning questions in the secondary education of girls 
is whether Latin shall be included in the reorganization. The com- 
mission will probably favor its inclusion for those who desire it. 
It is also proposed that a seventh year be provided in the organiza- 
tion for girls who wish to complete the baccalaureate to enter the 
universities or to prepare for a professional career. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION OF BOYS. 
The war has directed considerable attention to the system of secon- 
dary education for boys, and more discussion has probably centered 
around this problem than around any other. The education of 
adolescents gives rise to a large number of questions. If the schools 
are to play an important part in the restoration of the country, and 
if a new generation is to be built up to repair the ruins of the past 
four years, it is urged that the whole structure of adolescent educa- 
tion must be revised with a view to differentiation. The suggestions 
for the improvement of elementary education have already been 
discussed ; the proposals for the extension of a part-time compulsory 
attendance were referred to in the report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1916; the vital questions of the moment concern not 
merely the administrative reorganization of the secondary schools 
but the fundamental reconsideration of the principles on which their 
curricula are based. These questions resolve themselves, when

-P-A-G-E-255

examined, into the problem of better articulation with other insti- 
tutions, elementary and higher, the problem of creating increased 
opportunities for able pupils, and into the problem of revising the 
curricula and methods of the secondary schools to meet modern 
needs and demands.* 
The problem of articulation has already been referred to and the 
suggestions for selecting the abler pupils from the elementary schools 
for advancement to higher education have been mentioned. It is 
pointed out by the critics of the existing system that the reorganiza- 
tion of 1902 was based in part on a desire to meet social needs, and to 
this end the beginning of secondary education proper was postponed 
to 11 in order to encourage more boys to enter from the elementary 
schools. The division into cycles was based on the desire of opening 
the way for the transfer of pupils from the higher primary schools. 
It is proved statistically by M. Brelet? that neither of these purposes 
has been attained. In spite of the offer of scholarships pupils of the 
élementary schools do not present themselves as candidates in any 
large number mainly because the curriculum of the higher primary 
schools is better adapted to their needs. Nor do the pupils from the 
higher primary schools flock to the secondary schools to avail them- 
selves of the opportunity of completing the second cycle and the re- 
quirements for the baccalauréat. The few who are transferred find 
themselves handicapped, for three of the four available courses of 
the second cycle are closed to them because of their inadequate prep- 
aration in languages. From another point of view it is also proved 
statistically that the division into cycles is not warranted either by 
social or educational needs. The justifications for the division were, 
first, to encourage pupils to transfer from the higher primary schools, 
and, secondly, to enable pupils to leave at the close of the first cycle 
after completing a definite round of knowledge. Statistically it is 
shown that very few pupils leave at the end of the fourth year (in 
1910 only 965 out of 9,236), fewer in fact than at the close of any 
other year of the whole course. On these grounds, therefore, new 
principles must be sought for the reorganization of the secondary 
school, taking into account, not merely its educational purpose and 
function, but its relation to other institutions. ® 
The criticism of the present organization of the curriculum of the 
secondary schools is more widespread and more radical than is that 
of its administrative aspect. Education in France, it is argued, sets 
up false standards and is founded on false principles. France was

before the Great War a huge diploma factory and the eduactional 
horizon for every student is bounded by the diploma or the sanction 
that it carries. The universal test of individual worth is the posses- 
sion of a certificate. M. Lavisse, in a letter published on January 1, 
1918, writes: 
We suffered before this war from these bad habits in all branches of educa- 
tion. All of us were more or less the slaves of the examination. The examina- 
tion was the director general of public instruction. But the examination is a 
detestable director.* 
The result of this worship of paper qualifications is seen in the 
character of the syllabi and in the methods of instruction. The cur- 
riculum of the secondary schools is overcrowded; the energies and 
attention of the pupils are dispersed. The emphasis is placed on the 
acquisition rather than the assimilation of knowledge, on making the 
brain a storehouse rather than an instrument or tool.2? That is 
the necessary result of the preparation for recurring examinations 
instead of directing effort to the development of activity, judgment, 
and personality. Erudition, borrowed from the Germans, and book- 
ishness have taken the place of intelligent observation, intellectual 
curiosity, and contact with the needs of modern life. The product 
of the secondary schools of to-day, it is charged, is a sort of lay 
priest, living a life of his own, removed from social activity, and 
ignorant of the needs of society.* 
Fundamentally the problem is one of reconciling the old and the 
new cultures. The prevailing curriculum is merely a collection of 
subjects devised by specialists from their own point of view instead 
of a coordinated whole organized with a view to modern require- 
ments. Even the so-called practical courses, for example, in the 
sciences, that were introduced by the reform of 1902 are bookish and 
academic and but little related to present demands. 
While there is considerable unanimity in these criticisms, there is 
a parting of the ways when the proposals for reorganization are put 
forward. Two points of view can readily be distinguished. The 
one would turn the schools of France into trade and technical insti- 
tutions and put the traditional elements on one side;° the other, 
recognizing the defects of the present secondary school, would aim 
at introducing a new spirit responsive to modern requirements, while

retaining and emphasizing general education. Both sides agree with 
the late M. Liard that the university of France needs at present “a 
deep bath of realism.” ? 
While it is generally conceded that France must give greater atten- 
tion than hitherto to technical and vocational training in all its 
branches, partly to repair the losses of war, partly as a preparation 
for the economic competition after the war, those who take the 
extreme radical view of the function of education are few in number. 
It is recognized that the danger is great of being dazzled by Ger- 
many’s rapid industrial and commercial expansion in the past 30 or 
40 years and her early success in the war, both of which are attributed 
to her systematic technical training. But it is also admitted that 
the fruits of victory will have been lost if the world goes to school 
to Germany, and if the materialism that characterised so much of 
her education is allowed to predominate, in spite of her defeat. The 
moral and humane functions of education are in danger of being 
relegated into the background if the schools are turned into miniature 
factories in which the youth of the land will specialize narrowly for 
the particular vocation that they have selected. There are many of 
those who see the urgency of technical and industrial education who 
agree with the advocates of general education that the primary pur- 
pose of education must be to raise the general level of intelligence, to 
train men and women who understand their duties as citizens and 
workers, to develop individuals with breadth of mind, devotion to the 
ideals of the nation, and interest in social questions instead of turn- 
ing out human machines functioning solely for material ends. 
The problem of education is not solely one of economic production 
or the training of engineers, technicians, and workers, but of devel- 
oping men and women. Even if it is true that the basis of modern 
social organization is division of labor, it becomes more essential than 
ever to provide and prolong that education that gives all citizens a 
common background of general ideas and of a culture that. stresses 
human values. The best preparation for specialized technical train- 
ing is a good and extended general education. Those who argue 
that a genera] education can be obtained from specialized training 
run the risk of incurring failure in both. It is pointed out that in 
the most difficult and most technical branch. of the army, the artil- 
lery, the graduates of the secondary schools were able to master the 
intricacies after a very brief training. To concede the situation 
entirely to those who demand technical and vocational preparation

would involve a betrayal of the ideals for which the world has been 
fighting to the dangers of barbarism and materialism.+ 
The real issue is, therefore, how to modernize the general education 
that is considered almost universally to be essential, how to redefine 
culture in modern terms, how to organize a liberal education adapted 
to the needs of modern society. As in Great Britain and Germany 
this problem resolves itself into a consideration of the value of the 
classics. Those who argue that the French and French culture are 
Celtic in origin would at once abandon the classics. The majority of 
those who discuss this question, however, are agreed that French 
culture is continuous with Latin, and that Latin must, therefore, be 
the basis of an education that aims to impart French culture, to 
strengthen the French points of view, and to fortify national ideals.” 
A classical education, it is felt by many, is all the more necessary 
to-day as the source of an ideal of humanity which is essential for the 
development of moral ideas and the evolution of society. The failure 
of classical education has not been inherent in the subjects taught, 
but in the methods employed, in the emphasis on erudition rather 
than on their spirit. It is even suggested that the Latinless course be 
eliminated from the secondary schools and relegated to the higher 
primary schools. 
There is, on the other hand, a very pronounced opinion that in a 
scientific age, the sciences must form an important part of a liberal 
education. It is urged, however, that since science has no conscience 
and may serve a bad as well as a good cause, the emphasis in education 
should be placed on the relation of science to human welfare.? The 
greater extent to which an individual acquires a knowledge of the 
world of nature and of its manifestations, the nearer he approaches to 
a conception of his own place as a member of human society. It is 
conceded that the secondary schools may have neglected the sciences. 
but that does not establish its claim to absorb the whole of the cur- 
riculum. On this basis it is probable -that, as in England, there 
will be no difficulty in reconciling the demands of the classicists and 
scientists. The reorganization of secondary education will demand 
the harmonious development side by side of the humanities and the 
sciences. A general secondary education will include, therefore, 
French, the classics, with exemptions for those unable to profit by 
them, modern languages, history and geography, mathematics and 
science, and philosophy. Specialization should be delayed as long 
as possible and be based on a general education of this character.* 
Such an education, it is argued, will reconcile the old and the new,

the cultural and the utilitarian, the humanities and the sciences. On 
the basis of an education of this type those who are to become the 
nation’s leaders can be trained, well prepared intellectually to meet 
the demands of modern society. Such an education should aim to 
develop not encyclopedists or academic scholars, but men of physical, 
moral, and intellectual strength. The function of secondary educa- 
tion would, therefore, be selective, to train the élite from all social 
classes to the position of leadership,’ for as M. Steeg stated in pre- 
senting the budget of the Ministry of Education in 1911: “That an 
élite is necessary, it is not for democracy to deny; that an élite is 
necessary not only to maintain the prestige of society, but for the 
direction of the nation—on this point, I believe, that we can come to 
an agreement. The object of secondary education is the intellectual 
training of an élite which is destined to become directive and which 
must be prepared for its social réle.”” :

I. INTRODUCTION. 
The economic and social exigencies brought about for Italy by her 
entrance into the war in May, 1915, inevitably led her educational 
thinkers to submit her traditional system of education to more care- 
ful scrutiny than ever before, and to recognize how inadequate it 
was along certain lines to meet the demands thrust upon it by the 
new conditions. The first results of the consequent attempt at read- 
justment were seen in the enlarged scope given the schools—the 
teachers, the pupils, and the buildings—and in their vigorous coop- 
eration with the nation-wide organizations founded to minister to 
the immediate needs of the refugees from the invaded Provinces, to 
relieve the families of men called to the service, and to supply school 
facilities to an overwhelming influx of pupils. The local and pro- 
vincial teachers became, very logically, the executive heads of much 
of this activity; and pronounced benefits accrued to the schools in 
increased respect for them and popular dependence upon them. Ad- 
ministrative officials, teachers, and laymen interested in education 
were not slow in taking advantage of the new strategic position of 
the schools to initiate a propaganda of reform, which, taken up 
by the educational and secular press, began to direct itself definitely 
toward legislative action. This awakening of the nation, with the 
impetus given to educational interest, and the consequent testing of 
principles and methods hitherto held sacred from all criticism, con- 
stitutes the most valuable line for the review of educational matters 
in Italy for the past two years. Of the projects and plans broached, 
some naturally failed of enactment into school law; but all show, 
261
-P-A-G-E-262
  262 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
in their natural sequence from the lower to the higher, a uniform 
national desire to throw off the dead hand of traditionalism and to 
make education subserve the actual needs of the nation. 
ILLITERACY. 
Preliminary to the discussion of the elementary schools proper 
should come that of illiteracy, a national problem inextricably bound 
up with them and dependent for its solution upon their progress and 
betterment. The percentage of illiteracy in Italy has decreased from 
68.8 in 1871, the year of the first census after the unification, to 46.7 
in 1911, when, of a total population of nearly 35,000,000, approxi- 
mately 16,000,000 were illiterate. Of prime ethnological and climato- 
logical significance in the study of Italian illiteracy are the facts that 
the Italians are spread over many varieties of climate and altitude; 
that of the 8,323 communes (June, 1911) only 6 were without illit- 
erates, and only 18 had less than 1 per cent, all these being situated 
in northern Italy ; and that 456 situated in south central and southern 
Italy had an illiteracy of 75 per cent and over. 
Sicily and Sardinia showed the highest percentage of illiteracy ; 
the plateau and mountain Provinces the lowest. Of 30 communes 
1,500 meters and more above sea level, 16 showed an illiteracy of less 
than 5 per cent; 9 of less than 10 per cent; 5 of less than 20 per cent; 
only 1 of as much as 87 per cent. The highest commune in Italy— 
appropriately 2 commune di Chamois—showed a percentage of 0.9 
for women and 2 for men; the lowest commune in the Kingdom, one- 
third of a meter above sea level, had a percentage of 57 for women 
and 42 for men. Of 69 chief provincial cities and towns, 5 showed 
10 per cent of illiteracy and 10 more than 50 per cent. Turin had 
the lowest percentage, 5; Girgenti and Messina, in the extreme south- 
ern tip, had 57. The city of Rome showed 15 per cent. The minister 
of public instruction is seriously doing his best to overcome this chief 
menace to national life. For the year 1916, 4,246 night schools and 
1,923 holiday schools for illiterate adults—an increase of nearly 500 
in two years—accommodating approximately 100,000 men and 
women,! were authorized; and of continuation schools for semi- 
illiterate adults (scuole di complemento) nearly 1,400 were author- 
ized for the same year, an increase of nearly 200 over those of the 
two years preceding. Encouraging as these figures are, however, 
such adult schools can never be more than palliative measures. 
Italian social workers think the cure is to be found not in measures 
hitherto employed but in systematic increases of appropriations for 
elementary schools and salaries to elementary teachers. Valuable aid 
is anticipated from the plan adopted several years ago by the military

authorities, whereby illiterate soldiers, veterans as well as recruits, 
are to be given elementary instruction in the camps and military 
posts. It is feared, however, that the recently enacted law admitting 
illiterates of mature age to the electoral franchise will remove a great 
incentive to self-instruction, and prove a deplorable mistake from the 
point of view of combating illiteracy. 
Il. POPULAR EDUCATION. 
(a) ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, 
The elementary schools of Italy, in 1915, enrolled 3,692,024 chil- 
dren between the ages of 6 and 11 years, employed 75,993 teachers, 
17,243 men and 58,750 women, and cost the nation, combining central 
and local expenses, approximately $18,000,000.1_ They are, of course, 
the pivot of the entire educational system. In the judgment of 
Italy’s progressive social workers a fair if disillusionizing estimate 
of their influence upon Italian life was furnished by the very un- 
expectedly high rate of illiteracy, or practical illiteracy, shown in 
the youth registered for the armies since May, 1916. Many such 
had had one or more years’ schooling in the elementary schools. Act- 
ing on this stimulus, a definite move began for the complete recon- 
struction of the entire lower public school system. Among the most 
fruitful suggestions made by such bodies as the National Union of 
Italian Teachers, approved by the minister, and commended by the 
committee on education in the Chamber of Deputies were the follow- 
ing: 
1. The term of years for the courses of the elementary school 
should be shortened to four years at most; the subjects taught modi- 
fied in content and scope, and adapted to the comprehension and 
advancement of the pupils. Fewer subjects should be taught, and 
these should be taught well.” The traditional repetition of programs 
and schedules should at once be eliminated; and subjects divided 
into definitely briefer assignments, adapted to the capacity of the 
pupil. 
2. The number of pupils in each class under one teacher should 
be restricted to 25. 
8. School attendance should be absolutely obligatory between defi- 
nitely prescribed school age limits. This should be rigorously en- 
forced by the civil authorities, with a graduated scale of fines for de- 
linquent parents and guardians. 
4, With the improvement in teaching thus demanded, teachers’ 
salaries should be raised from the prevailing average of 200 lire 
($40.00) per month to at least twice that amount, and this increase 
1 Bxpenses of public elementary instruction are for 1916-17.  
-P-A-G-E-264
  264 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
should be accompanied by an emphasis upon the quality and stand- 
ing of the teacher in popular estimation. The elementary teacher 
should be required to have a teacher’s diploma. 
5. On the administrative side, more efficient operation of the sys- 
tem of inspectors should be secured by a diminution in the number 
of vice-inspectors from the present 1,000 to 600, and the increase of 
the full inspectors from 400 to 600, promotion being restricted to 
members of the lower grade and made solely on the basis of merit 
and service. The jurisdiction of either grade should be limited to 
30 communes at most. Vice-inspectors should be relieved of all 
teaching functions, and should be required to devote their attention 
exclusively to the supervising duties in the zones assigned. 
6. Fundamental to all these, greater local power should be granted 
the communes in the management of the elementary schools, and in 
the adjustment of courses to local needs and conditions. The subjects 
taught in remote rural schools should be sharply SES from 
those taught in cities and populous towns. 
In furtherance of this movement the Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion, early in 1918, appointed a committee of inspectors and vice- 
inspectors, with powers to formulate a report of conditions and of 
recommendations. This report is awaited with very favorable in- 
terest by all the educational forces of the State. 
Under the vigorous administration of Sig. Berenini, while no 
strictly legal reforms in elementary education were made during the 
past two years, the systematic attempt was made, in so far as this was 
possible by departmental ordinances, to bring elementary education 
into vital relation with the needs of every-day life, especially in the 
rural districts. In this connection, the peasant schools of the Agro 
Romano, in a peculiar sense the ward of the State, have constituted a 
valuable object lesson as to the possibilities of rural schools. The 
report of the committee, issued in July, 1917, and covering the 10 
years of the schools’ existence, shows the harmonious cooperation of 
the State with the commune, the former working out hygienic and 
technical problems, the latter those of a moral and ethical nature. 
The population and teaching material in the Agro Romano was, at 
the inception, regarded as perhaps the most backward to be found in 
Italy. Beginning in 1907 with 8 schools, enrolling 340 pupils, they 
have grown to 73 regular schools, and 3 pre-schools (énfantili asilt), 
enrolling and partly feeding 3,220 pupils. Furthermore, 14 State 
and communal upper elementary schools combined exist in communi- 
ties where the original elementary lower schools began operation. 
These schools are of four types, regular day, vacation, night (for 
adults), and infantili asili. They have rendered through their teach-

75 square miles,

ing staff increasingly effective assistance to destitute families and 
those of men called to the service, and their buildings have served as 
gathering places in the civic life of the community. These schools 
have the definite aim of preparing the pupils for their environment, 
to improve it, and to train them in agricultural pursuits, in building 
better homes, and in improving means of communication. Especial 
attention is called in the report to the efficiency of the system of 
inspection of these schools. 
The direct attention focused by the minister of public instruction 
upon elementary education has been accompanied by marked success 
in keeping before the Italian people the vital importance of the 
schools during the period of national stress. The enrollment in ele- 
mentary education, by the figures of January 1, 1916, exceeded by 
more than 500,000 that of the preceding year, and on an estimated 
gain in population of approximately a million. The branches of 
education related to the elementary, such as the asili, the kinder- 
gartens, the auxiliary schools, communal and private, and the par- 
ents’ associations, have all shared in the benefits of this awakening, 
and all have been reenforced by private initiative. 
A culmination to the active efforts of the Italian Federation of 
Popular Libraries was seen in the royal decree of May, 1918, mak- 
ing compulsory a library of at least 50 volumes in each elementary 
school, to be purchased and maintained by the State and commune 
jointly. It is hoped that this compulsory popular library may be- 
come the nucleus for a system of popular education for the older 
members of the community; that, by means of large increase in the 
existing grant devoted to popular and school libraries, and a place 
set apart for the library in each new school, popular extrascholastic 
classes may be held; that for teachers of such schools recourse may 
be had, in small rural communities, to such educated persons as there 
may be in the vicinity, while help may be given by teachers from 
neighboring towns; and that ultimately attendance at such classes 
may be made obligatory up to the age of 18. 
(b) SCUOLE POPOLARE; RURAL SCHOOLS. 
The putting of the scuole popolare into operation is the most 
striking advance made in the field of Italian education during the 
past two years. The legal enactment constituting them was the re- 
sult of an organic growth, combining features of the plans submitted 
by the Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Labor, in December, 
1916, and by Sig. Ruffini, then Minister of Public Instruction, in 
February, 1917. Their compositely social and educational character 
is well illustrated by the history of the origin and passage of the
-P-A-G-E-266
266 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
law establishing them. The salient points of the scwole popolare, 
both in organization and aims, are as follows: 
1. The Government, with the consent of the local school council and 
the communes, was instructed to found a new type of school based 
upon the completion of the fifth and sixth elementary classes, and 
offering instruction of special and vocational character, as well as a 
development of the courses in the basic subjects, especially arithmetic 
and practical geometry, drawing, and the elements of physical and 
applied natural sciences. Such schools were to cover three years addi- 
tional to the elementary schools, and in the case of communes reserv- 
ing to themselves the management of the elementary schools, the 
power of further amplifying the scuole popolare was granted. 
2. The entire three years’ course was to take the name of scwole 
popolare, be recognized as an institution of public instruction in legal 
standing, and governed by special statute approved by royal decree 
on the recommendation of the minister. The teaching staff and the 
program of special and general courses were to be determined by the 
statute embodying the school. Courses in agriculture, horticulture, 
agricultural economics, and whatsoever other scientific pursuits were 
adapted to the climate and needs of the individual locality were to 
be fostered and taught intensively. Onlv those teachers that should 
, have pursued special training. courses in the subjects they were as- 
signed to teach should be elected to the scuole popolare, and only 
upon the passing of examinations thereon. To be nominated as 
teacher of Italian, history, and civil ethics, geometry and arithmetic, 
the teacher must hold the diploma of the normal school or have 
served at least five years satisfactorily in the elementary public 
schools. The minimum salary of teachers in the scwole popolare was 
fixed at 2,000 lire ($400) for communes having over 20,000 inhabitants 
and at 1,500 lire ($300) for communes having less. The weekly 
schedule of instruction required of each teacher was to be 24 hours. 
For hours exceeding this he was to receive additional compensation 
of 80 lire ($16) per annum for each hour, and for hours falling 
below he was to be required to render such assistance as the giunta 
of the commune should direct. 
8. For admission to the scuole popolare the usual maturité exami- 
nations required for admission to the first class of the middle and 
complementary schools should not be valid. Only students com- 
pleting in actual residence the work of the lower elementary school 
and passing the promotion examinaticn of the fifth elementary 
grade were to be admitted to them. Students completing the work 
of the scuole popolare were to be admitted to the first classes of the 
technical and complementary schools upon the examinations and con- 
ditions fixed by the ministerial regulation. The leaving certificate 
of the scuole popolare should be recognized as equivalent to the
-P-A-G-E-267
  EDUCATION IN ITALY. 267 
leaving certificate of technical schools tor admission to posts in va- 
rious branches of the public service. 
Rules governing the passage of certificated students from the 
scoule popolare to the agricultural and vocational middle schools 
were to be fixed by royal decree on the recommendation of the Min- 
isters of Public Instruction and of Agriculture, Industry, and Com- 
merce. 
To sum up: The scwole popolare are essentially rural and scien- 
tific, of considerable freedom in courses and schedules, supported by 
the commune and the State jointly, largely autonomous, and in the 
nature of continuation schools, being, in the words of Minister 
Berenini, “a bridge between the elementary and the vocational and 
technical schools.” They are designed primarily for children hith- 
erto unable through economic stress to continue in school. Scientific 
and vocational advantages, hitherto offered only in schools of higher 
grade and at a distance, are now brought within local reach. 
An interesting phase of the scuole popolare is afforded in the 
tentative plans for the establishment of a marine popular school at 
Venice. As outlined, this school is designed to impart instruction in 
elementary navigation, making and managing boats, pisciculture in 
the various phases shown in particular localities, and devices for 
catching, conserving, and transporting of fish. Promising pupils 
will be afforded aid in proceeding on to higher technical marine 
schools already established, 
(c) RURAL SCHOOLS, 
A distinct move for the establishment of rural schools of ele- 
mentary grade, below the sevole popolare, but offering advantages 
akin to them, was launched at a meeting of the National Teachers’ 
Union for Popular Education, held in Rome in May, 1918. The 
discussion was participated in by representatives of the Association 
for the Interests of Southern Italy, by the director and the Commis- 
sion for the Peasant Schools of the Agro Romano, the school press, 
and many students of the needs of the rural population. Resolu- 
tions were passed calling for the recognition by the Government of 
the difference of the rural schools from the urban, the need of re- 
ducing studies and hours, of limiting the number of pupils under one 
teacher to 40, and of diminishing the number of holidays, the obliga- 
tory establishment of four grades with enforced compulsory 
attendance, assistance to needy children, increased salaries for 
teachers, attention to their physical health and comfort, and the 
naming of a special commission to study the conditions of the schools 
and children of the rural districts. Such a move marks a distinct 
advance in educational thought and administration, by which atten-
-P-A-G-E-268
  268 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
tion was first called on Italian soil to the essential difference be- 
tween the problems of the city and country schools. 
Closely related is the subject of agricultural instruction in the ele- 
mentary schools, about which much discussion has centered within 
the past two years. There has been a growing feeling that aside 
from the lack or coordination between the subjects taught in the ele- 
mentary rural schools and the environment of the rural children, 
there is also a very pronounced hiatus in the system between the 
lower agricultural schools and the elementary schools, by which 
many children naturally inclined to the study of applied agriculture 
have no opportunity or encouragement to pursue it. The clear-cut 
demand voiced in many quarters for the establishment of distinctive 
rural schools has, in a degree, taken the place of a move for the 
development of the elementary schools along specifically agricul- 
tural lines, being popularly regarded as a substitute for these. Yet 
many persons interested in education have pointed out that, while 
each project has its peculiar advantages, the incorporation of ele- 
mentary agricultural and horticultural courses in the already ex- 
istent elementary schools is more practical, reaches a larger propor- 
tion of pupils, and can be more speedily put into operation, with far 
less expense and difficulty of adjustment of teachers and courses 
than would be possible with the distinctive rural schools projected. 
A foreshadowing of this will be seen below in the section devoted 
to the training of teachers, where it is emphasized that preparation 
for imparting instruction in sciences adapted to local needs has been 
given a prominent place in the new teachers’ courses. 
(d) AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS. 
By royal decree of 1907 elementary schools of agriculture were es- 
tablished with the aim of preparing students for intermediate and 
advanced institutions. They offer a three years’ course in Italian, 
language, history, and geography, mathematics and applied geom- 
etry, surveying, drawing, calculation, elementary physical and natu- 
ral sciences, and in the last year intensive training in agriculture and 
related industries. In 1917 there were 29 of these, only one of which 
was for women. They are situated in larger centers, enroll local 
students almost exclusively, and do not especially appeal to rural 
students. On the latter account, some dissatisfaction has been ex- 
pressed with them, and plans have been projected to remove them 
-from their town and urban surroundings, and transplant them to 
sites where experimental farms and first-hand study of concrete 
problems may be feasible. Such removals would also afford valuable 
object lessons for the native rural population, as showing the desire 
of the Government to become acquainted with and to remedy back-
-P-A-G-E-269
  EDUCATION IN ITALY. : 269 
ward conditions in remote communities. It was largely out of this 
dissatisfaction that the demand for the establishment of rural schools 
"and agricultural courses in the elementary rural schools grew. 
The entire subject of agricultural instruction, in all its grades, has 
drawn unprecedented impetus from the growing conviction brought 
home to the nation by the war that in the economic and social recon- 
struction after the war agriculture must play the largest part, and, 
furthermore, that if education is to be nationalized, the start must 
be made by giving the study of agriculture the most prominent place 
in the schools. Thus the different phases of the discussion of agri- 
culture in the schools are but interrelated branches of the one uniform 
and urgent problem, 
(e) VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS, 
The auspicious start made toward building up a complete system 
of vocational training by the provisions of the law secured by Min- 
ister de Nava, in 1912, has not been followed by satisfactory actual 
results. That law called for the establishment of one elementary 
vocational school based immediately upon the lower elementary 
schools in each commune of 10,000 or more inhabitants, excluding the 
larger cities. There are estimated to be 800 such communes; and as 
the aggregate expense, amounting to 13,000,000 lire ($2,600,000), 
was from the first a deterrent to the execution of the law, only a few 
have been established in the most progressive communes. Another 
article in the law provided for the establishment of vocational 
schools for the advanced training of young workmen from 18 to 18 
years who have attended the upper elementary schools or have had 
practical apprentice instruction for two years in addition to the leav- 
ing certificate of the lower elementary schools. It is estimated that 
the number of these youths is approximately a million, and that to 
establish and adequately equip the necessary number of such schools 
at least 5,000,000 lire additional would be required. Attention has 
repeatedly been called by social workers to the great good such schools 
would do; and it is to be hoped that among the first tasks undertaken 
in the reconstruction of Italy’s school system after the war will be 
the revival of the De Nava law on vocational education. 
An interesting experiment in lowering the age and requirements 
necessary for pupils to enter essentially vocational schools has been 
made near Castillo, in Umbria, for boys of the invaded district 
between 9 and 14 years. Organized under the legal title of Colonie 
dei Giovine Lavoratori, and by private beneficence, the project 
was regarded as of such social significance that an original grant 
of 75,000 lire ($15,000), supplemented by subsequent ones, was made 
by the Minister of Arms and Munitions, and later increased by  
-P-A-G-E-270
  270 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
subscriptions from the American Red Cross and private benefactions. 
The first colonia to be established has for its scope to secure tracts ~ 
of unused land, to organize the labor of the boys applying for 
entrance, and to offer not only agricultural courses but also, by 
arrangements with the industries of neighboring centers, training 
in trades and handicrafts. There is also contemplated an essentially 
instructional side in a four years’ elementary course, supplemented 
by a two years’ popular course, but of more intensive character than 
the.scucle popolare. In view of the unusual circumstances of the 
students, especial attention to ethical training is felt to be necessary. 
If successful it is hoped that the Government will take over the 
movement, and the experiment be expanded to a chain of such 
colonie. 
(£) BxTRA-SCHOLASTIC ACTIVITIES. 
Signs of the awakening of the schools to national service along 
many lines apart from the strictly scholastic abound during the 
past two years. Exhibits of didactic material, manufactured by 
school children, have been held at various points, notably at Naples, 
showing both regional products and use of materials, as well as 
national character and utility. The real economic value, also, was 
plain, in view of the closing of the Italian frontiers, and the cutting 
off of school supplies as well as others. Amid these most adverse 
conditions the discovery that Italian talent was able to devise and 
make school-room equipment constituted a long step forward in 
Italy’s economic emancipation. In pursuance of the project of a 
national system of book printing and binding set forth by a meeting 
of all interested in handicrafts, held at Milan in April, 1917, courses 
in bookbinding in certain city schools were attempted, and excellent 
work along this line has been exhibited. The Association of Teach- 
ers of Physical Training in Italy, meeting in June, 1917, vigorously 
urged definite courses in physical training and especially that sports 
be incorporated in the elementary schools. The latter demand drew 
unexpected impetus from the physical training imparted recruits, 
with the consequent radical improvement in physique and morale. 
Advocates of the movement claimed to see in the final triumph on 
the Piave the manifest proof of the value of sports and athletics. 
Schools of child welfare have been established at various points, 
generally in connection with orphanages and asili for destitute chil- 
dren from the invaded regions. Their aim has been to give a practi- 
cal and solid basis of training to all persons intrusted with the care 
of children, to diffuse a knowledge of the rules of hygiene among 
the women of Italy, especially in the crowded centers and in remote 
sections, and thus to combat Italy’s high rate of infant mortality. 
While not under the control of the Government, these schools have

had its cordial encouragement and frequent subsidies for certain 
lines of investigation, and they have exercised a definite reciprocal 
effect upon the official system of public instruction. 
(g) HOSPITAL SCHOOLS FOR WOUNDED ITALIAN SOLDIERS. 
Wounded Italian soldiers were given elementary instruction in 
hospital schools at various points, conducted by teachers assigned 
from the public schools and by volunteers. Chief of these were the 
schools at Milan and Naples, which led the way in securing govern- 
mental inspection and concession of the right of examinations for 
the third-grade finishing certificate of the elementary schools. The 
work was organized along the two lines of instruction for total 
illiterates, and for backward soldiers of mental advancement meas- 
ured by the work of the fifth and sixth elementary. Classes in choral 
singing were introduced with the aim of discovering wounded men 
of musical abilities and training them for popular choral instruction. 
Marked interest was aroused among the pupils of the public schools 
by a governmental appeal for voluntary contributions to a perma- 
nent fund for reeducation work among the soldiers. Practically 
every elementary school in the Kingdom contributed. 
Accounts of this eminently successful work are of real pedagogical 
value to students of the relative capacities and aptitudes of children 
and adults. The following extracts are taken from the account of 
Signorina Paltrinieri, one of the teachers in the Milan schoo}, who 
has best outlined the spirit and significance of this work in the life 
of the nation: 
These schools were not for the physical rehabilitation of the wounded, nor 
for their training in trades and crafts; they were for the teaching of book 
subjects and for adults, most of whom, even the youngest, would seem beyond 
the plastic age. And yet the results were amazing. 
As regards the teaching material, all were peasants or drawn from the lowest 
urban classes, economically and socially. Most were unable to read and write, 
though many had attended one or more of the first three grades of the ele- 
mentary schools, but had dropped out and had forgotten practically all they 
had ever learned. The distinctive characteristic common to all was the intense 
desire to retrieve lost time and ‘opportunities. The hospital schoolroom was 
not only crowded during school hours, but was after hours a center for those 
wishing to finish tasks and to talk over problems connected with the lessons. 
There were many points of difference between the ordinary school trchin and 
these feverishly ardent boys of larger growth. These soldier pupils forgot 
that the day was a holiday. They always had in the bookbag the book and 
copybook and pencil needed and were always proof against such distractions 
as impede the usual elementary school. To them the conquering of the task in 
hand was the vital point. 
The reasons given by the soldier pupils for their ignorance were strikingly 
illuminating for the life and psychology of the people; the schoolhouse was toc 
far from home, the boy had no good clothes, the family could not or would  
-P-A-G-E-272
  272 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
not get along without his earnings, etc. With yet others plain laziness and 
loafing, confessed with boyish ingeniousness, made them shirk, and they quit 
school as soon as possible. “If my daddy (pare) had only given me a sound 
licking and marched me off to school” was the most common lament, voiced 
in all the dialects of Italy. 
In point of intelligence, pure and simple, the child has an undoubted ad- 
vantage over the adult. His mind is fresh, open, ready to receive the stamp 
upon the proverbial wax. The adult is what he is. We can make him better; 
we can change the directions of his thoughts and ideas; but mold him as we 
will—no. 
In application, of course, the adult has the indisputable advantage. He knows 
the hours for lessons are limited. He is determined to get the very most out 
of them. His attention is seldom distracted. Even distinguished visitors— 
so eagerly welcomed by children—can not break the severe and imperturbable 
calm of these soldier pupils. Visitors pass from bench to bench, smiling, en- 
thusiastic, patronizing. These model pupils look up, answer respectfully, smile 
from the depths of those inscrutable eyes—and even before the disturbing ele- 
ment is well out of the room have plunged again into their tasks. 
As regards the will, this is the wedge for the adult. By dint of patience, 
of study, of determination, they do the impossible. The will, too, acts power- 
fully on their physical condition. Men, wounded in the right hand, grasped 
the pen and guiding the wounded member with the sound one, day by day 
by desperate efforts gained freedom of movement. Men with head wounds 
suffered terribly under certain atmospheric conditions, but they never missed 
school. 
In experience of life and stock of ideas no comparison is possible. Other consid- 
erations apart, an enormous saving of time and energy was found in not having 
to explain the ordinary phenomena of life to the adult, as has to be done with 
the child. The adult applies everything as he progresses. In point of stock of 
«words, however, the child does not differ so markedly from the illiterate adult. 
The Italian peasant, no matter of what dialect, has an extremely limited vocabu- 
lary. So has the child. But the child is always, consciously and unconsciously, 
enlarging his stock of words; the adult is content with what he has. 
Coming now to the application of these diverse mental aptitudes to the 
acquisition of school subjects, less difficulty in direction was encountered by the 
child than by the adult. The child has a tabula rasa of a mind. He hears a 
sound clear and distinct. He does not confuse it with other sounds. It does not 
start in him a train of kindred concepts. He puts down what he hears. The 
adult, on the other hand, hears a sound; it awakens innumerable dormant asso- 
ciations. His dialect is another ever-present obstacle. The struggle to cut 
these away is unceasingly hard. Repetition, untiring repetition by teacher and 
pupil, is indispensable. 
On the subject of composition for literary form the child’s composition is 
better; for subject matter, the adults. A soldier had for some time been in an 
agony of suspense at not hearing from home. One day he had assigned to him 
as a theme to write a letter home asking some favor. He fell to work and wrote 
desperately, the teacher watching him, The letter was full of ardent affection, 
of deep grief, of hope, of encouragement to his dear ones, but on the theme as- 
signed nothing. He protested with emotion that he could not write to ask a 
favor of poor folk who had hardly a roof over their heads. 
In arithmetic and calculation, as is to be expected, the adult far outstrips the 
child. No time is wasted on the tables with soldiers—that inexhaustible foun- 
tainhead of wasted time for children, The man does the problem, does it
-P-A-G-E-273
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 278 
correctly, verifies it, out of some incident in his old trade or calling and goes on 
acquiring new facility, 
In penmanshp and drawing, as between the man and the child, the adult has 
a hardness of muscle, the child a weakness of hand. The man has the better 
trained eye and sense of proportion, the child a singleness of vision and an 
ability to isolate the object. 
In reading, the adult has advantages of application that enable him to do 
in two or three months what it takes the child a year to do. The intensive 
drill upon individual letters is feasible and fruitful with adults, being a drill 
soldier pupils enjoy and continue after hours. 
As regards the explanation of passages read, adults make a better showing 
than children. The quicker witted and more attentive the child is, the more 
does he tend to repeat the words of the original. The adult, on the contrary, 
changes, adapts, discourses on it, if he is talkative, brings it to the touch- 
stone of his own experience, approves or rebukes, in brief, incorporates it 
into his mental life. 
So with grammar, with history, with geography, with oral arithmetic, with 
the elements of physical sciences, each one chronicles a series of victories for 
the adult over the child. Take the field of history. The child thinks the reign 
of Servius Tullius the least interesting of all; the adult, though a peasant, 
grasps the force of its economic and social changes. The child will glibly tell of 
the exiJe of Charles Albert, adding pathetic personal touches; the man will tell 
of the importance of his connection with the constitution of 1848. 
Now, what are the net results of this teaching of adult soldier-pupils? II- 
literates, or practically such, in less than one year passed the examination di 
compimento (admission to the fifth grade). At the Ospedale della Guastalia, 
an illiterate Sicilian lad, with a severe wound in his head, from which the 
fragment of shell could not be extracted, and with his left side completely 
paralyzed, passed the examination with the following marks on a basis of 10; 
8 in dictation, grammar, oral and written arithmetic; 7 in explanation of 
passages read; 6 in penmanship, composition, and reading. 
Rather industrial than instructional in scope, but closely related is 
the work of the National Association for Artistic and Industrial 
Assistance to the Wounded and the Invalided, organized in July, 
1917, and counting among its membership thousands of eminent men 
and women in all parts of Italy. Its aims are to forward the artistic 
and industrial progress of soldier pupils by governmental and local 
encouragement, to assist former pupils in the establishment of busi- 
ness, to assist in the disposal of their products for them by the estab- 
lishment of provincial and urban magazines, to enlist the active 
cooperation of eminent artists in all parts of Italy, and to organize 
committees in every part of Italy. The work of the association has 
been of great value in spreading an interest in matters artistic among 
the masses of the people, and in showing them the means of develop- 
ing latent talent. 
(h) PROJECTED PLANS FOR SCHOOLS AFTER THE WAR, 
Since early in the war steadily increasing attention has been de- 
voted to the subjects and methods of public instruction adapted to 
post-war conditions. This took definite shape in the appointment,

  ' 
274 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
in June, 1918, by royal decree, of a commission, headed by the Min- 
ister of Public Instruction and composed of members of the Con- 
siglio Superiore and persons eminent in the educational life of 
Italy, to study and report upon the subjects and form of education . 
adapted to the solution of the most urgent problems that will then 
confront the nation. The scope of this commission as a whole is 
practically unlimited, comprising, as it does, all forms of national, 
social, and educational activity. It will work by sections, one of 
which will have under its especial charge the study of national cul- 
ture, educational and instructional. The tentative outline of the 
activities of the commission indicates that it will study not merely 
the transitory and superficial measures necessitated by disarmament, 
but the graver problems consequent thereon. The commission is 
instructed to take a historical survey of Italian school life under all 
its phases and to avail itself of all social and educational investiga- 
tions undertaken by official and private’ organizations. ‘The appoint- 
ment of the commission has been received with enthusiasm by Italian 
teachers of all grades, who. indicate an ardent wish to cooperate in 
all its labors. 
By an interesting coincidence the composite report of the com- 
mission appeared the same week as-the' signing of the armistice. 
The plan of the several educational reforms, unanimously approved 
and recommended for immediate action, fell under the following 
heads: 
1. The thorough execution of all school laws and the overhauling 
of the national financial system to this end. 
2. The organic inclusion, within the national system of education, 
of kindergartens and nursery schools by means of the subsidizing or 
nationalizing of existing ones, and the establishment of many others. 
3. The continuous construction, within the period of five years, of 
all school buildings lacking to the needs of population and the legal 
announcement of compulsory attendance upon them. 
4. The establishment of at least one compulsory school of four 
grades in each commune. 
5. The establishment of especially adapted secondary schools for 
the preliminary professional training of teachers. 
6. The raising of the minimum salary of teachers to 3,000 lire 
($600) and the investing of the teaching profession with enhanced 
moral and social prestige. 
7. The lengthening of the school year and the requirement of the 
teacher to take part in civic and communal tasks. 
8. The fixing of the final leaving age of pupils at 18 years. 
9. The establishment of com pulacy schools for illiterate adults 
up to 45 years.
-P-A-G-E-275

10. The establishment, on the application of communal authori- 
ties, of popular courses, schools of hygiene and sanitation, lan- 
guages, ete. 
11. The subordination of the national budget to the needs of 
popular education, and not vice versa. 
12. The paying of greater attention to woman’s place in the na- 
tional life, with especial regard to the needs of peasant and labor- 
ing women. 
To students of education the striking feature of this move is 
the proof it affords that Italy conceives of no renewal of her eco- 
nomic life without the accompanying reform in her educational 
system. ¢ 
III. MIDDLE SCHOOLS. 
In the Italian scheme of education the scuole medie are held to 
include industrial and commercial schools, the iséiéwti tecnici, the 
normal schools, the ginnasi and the licet. 
(a) INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL SCHOOLS, 
The exigencies of the war have brought out clearly the need of 
reform in the general group of industrial schools, occupying as these 
do so important a place in the practical training of the nation’s 
youth. Especial attention began to center two years ago upon the 
industrial and commercial divisions, and early in 1917, by minis- 
terial decree, the few schools of this type already in existence were 
developed, their numbers largely increased, and their relations with 
the elementary schools below and with the éstituti teenici above were 
clearly defined. 
The industrial schools thus enlarged are denominated Royal In- 
dustrial Schools of the Second Grade. They are 103 in number, sit- 
uated in the populous centers, and designed to offer in a four-years 
course the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary for the 
future heads of artistic and industrial manufacturing establishments. 
To the first class of these schools are admitted pupils having either 
(a) a certificate of promotion from the vocational schools of the 
1st grade, or (0) the leaving certificate from the higher elementary 
schools, or (¢) in the discretion of the director, those 12 years of 
age and presenting an examination upon selected subjects comprised 
in the programs of the higher elementary course. Continuous prog- 
ress in the industrial school group was further sought in the new 
rules for the admission of pupils from the industrial schools of the 
2nd grade to the more highly specialized schools of the 3d grade. 
For this was accepted, (a) the leaving certificates of the technical or 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  276 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
complementary school, royal or private, or () the certificate of pro- 
motion from the second to the third communal course of the Royal 
Institute of Fine Arts, or (¢) certificate of promotion examination, 
or (d) the leaving certificate of a royal commercial school of the 
second grade with special examination on selected subjects. The 
19 royal industrial or vocational schools of the third grade offer spe- 
cialized courses in weaving and dyeing, silk industry, working on 
hides and skins, mechanics, paper industry, forestry, typography, 
electric engineering, and radio-telegraphy. Admission of pupils 
of the second grade to them also requires the certificate specifying 
the specialty in which the pupil has worked, or the leaving certifi- 
cate of the commercial school embracing subjects continued in the 
royal vocational schools. 
Similarly the 27 royal commercial schools of the second grade 
hold the same rank as the industrial, affording instruction for man- 
agers and employees of commercial pursuits, and offering a course 
covering four years, or, in the case of schools annexed to a royal 
commercial school of the third grade or advanced grade, three 
years. Admission to the first class of the Commercial schools of the 
second grade is (a) upon completion of 10 years of age and the 
certificate of the maturité examination from the higher elementary 
schools, or (6) the leaving certificates of the royal commercial 
school, or (¢) certified three years’ attendance thereon, or (d) in 
the discretion of the director, completion of 12 years of age and the 
passing of examination upon selected subjects of the course of the 
commercial school. The 11 royal commercial schools of the third 
grade, located in the large cities, admit only complete graduates of 
schools of the second grade. 
By the regulation, especial attention is paid to the professional 
qualifications of the directors of these respective schools. The di- 
rector of the industrial school shall be in immediate charge of in- 
struction in the technical subjects and the related applied sciences. 
If in a women’s school, the directress shall be in immediate charge of 
the subjects of a domestic or graphic nature, or those constituting 
the basis of the school’s existence. Similarly, in the royal commercial 
school the director shall be in immediate supervision of instruction in 
the subjects of international commerce and trade, physical, political 
and commercial geography, and legal and economic subjects. 
(b) TECHNICAL SCHOOLS, 
Ranking immediately above the industrial and commercial schools 
of the second grade are the technical schools intermediate between 
the higher elementary schools and the istétuti teenici, admitting 
pupils upon the completion of the higher elementary courses, and 
upon special examination in Italian, mathematics, and the elements
-P-A-G-E-277
  
EDUCATION IN ITALY. QT 
of the physical sciences. Their courses cover three years, and upon 
their completion the pupil is admitted to the éstituti teenici, the most 
highly specialized of all the divisions of secondary education. In the 
field of the lower technical schools Sig. Berenini has proposed to the 
Consiglio Superiore certain reforms calculated to subserve more fully 
the scientific needs of the nation. Chief among these are: 
1. The decrease of two hours weekly in the schedule of each class, 
thus leaving three afternoons per week free of teaching, to be de- 
voted preferably to physical education and the combination of the 
stiences and mathematics, thus preserving in the school all the sub- 
jects prescribed by the law. 
2. The lightening of some subjects and distribution of others 
‘through the three years, as, for example, in Italian, the abolition 
of all rules of composition as well as all memorizing of names in 
Italian literature; the coordination of all study of Italian literature 
with history, substituting for the systematic and chronological study 
of history the biographical and episodic method; the reservation of 
the difficult points of cosmography for the second class; the begin- 
ning of geometry in the first class, and its limitation to a purely 
experimental and graphic nature. 
8. The rendering identical the technical schools for girls with those 
for boys, in subjects, arrangement of courses, and schedules, except 
for instruction in domestic arts. 
(c) NORMAL SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES, 
The training of teachers for the elementary schools of Italy was 
earnestly and continuously discussed for years before Italy’s en- 
trance into the war. With new and unprecedented demands upon 
the schools, there has been a growing conviction that the traditional 
subjects and methods of training teachers were too exclusively 
literary to prepare teachers for the elementary school and that they 
must be thoroughly reconstructed. Under the existing system, 
teachers are trained in normal schools, separate for men and women, 
and offering three years’ courses in pedagogy, lectures and theory, 
ethics, Italian language, literature, history and geography, mathe- 
matics, elements of natural sciences, hygiene, drawing, penmanship, 
elements of agriculture, gymnastics, and practice teaching in the 
first grade of the elementary school. For men, gymnastics and 
manual arts, and for women, household arts and kindergarten teach- 
ing are also required. Completion of the studies of the higher ele- 
mentary school with examinations on selected subjects is necessary 
for admission. 
In the criticism of the old order of training, and the demand for 
a more modern type, individuals, teacher’s associations, and the
-P-A-G-E-278
  278 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
press participated. The National Teachers’ Association, meeting 
in Rome in 1918 and using as a basis the results of the referendum 
taken among the teachers of 17 Ghee and towns, well summed up 
the situation as follows: 
The elementary school had in the last few years become com- 
pletely transformed in its character, and the demands made upon 
it had changed as well. It had doubled its content, and in its 
programs, no matter with what shortcomings, was at least attempt- 
ing to embrace a new field of activities, and so to keep abreast of 
modern conditions. With this developraent, the normal schools, 
through no fault of their own, had not kept pace. They had been 
forced to continue to train teachers for the simple and primitive 
schools of half a century ago, long since outgrown, and they simply* 
could not give adequate preparation for the complex demands of 
modern life. 
This nation-wide demand for normal teaching reform crystalized 
early in 1918 in a bill presented by Sig. Berenini for passage by 
the Italian Parliament. Its progressive nature once made known, 
the bill found instant and hearty support, and the senate’ passed it 
with but little delay. In the Chamber of Deputies, however, it en- 
countered unexpected opposition, and in June, 1918, was referred to 
a conference committee. Though its actual enactment was thus post- 
poned, yet its passage is confidently anticipated. In content and 
scope this bill marks so decided an advance in the training of na- 
tional teachers as to merit a careful examination of its main lines, 
based upon the actual legal provisions. 
1. Purpose.—The teachers’ institute (istituto magistrale) has the 
aim of preparing teachers for the elementary and popular schools. 
It shall be for men and for women, separate. If for men, it shall 
be of four years; if for women, seven years, the first two years to be 
counted as belonging to the ésti¢uéi of the first grade, and the last five 
to those of the second grade. 
2. Relation to the present normal schools.—The existing normal 
schools for women, with the annexed practice schools, are to be trans- 
formed into women’s istituti magistrali of seven years; those without 
annexed practice schools are to be transformed into men’s istituti 
magistrali of four years, corresponding to the last four years of the 
seven-year type, particular details to.be left to the ministerial decree. 
Existing provincial, communal and other istituti for the training of 
teachers may secure rating as istituti magistrali upon conforming in 
all respects to the present law. 
3. Subjects to be taught.—The subjects of the first six classes of 
the women’s is¢ituéi shall be: Italian language, literature, history 
and geography, general pedagogy and ethics, French, mathematics, 
physical and natura] sciences, domestic arts, drawing and penman- 
 
-P-A-G-E-279
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 279 
ship, singing and physical education. The subjects to be taught in 
the first three classes of the men’s és¢étuti shall be identical. with 
those for the corresponding years of women’s éstituét, except for the 
addition of agriculture, hygiene, and two years of manual arts. In 
the last class of all éstétuti shall be: History and methodology of 
pedagogy, hygiene, agriculture, singing, advanced physical edu- 
cation, and practice teaching in the annexed’ elementary or 
popular school, or kindergarten. Instruction in hygiene is to be 
imparted by specialists, and that in agriculture by a traveling in- 
structor, or by an instructor in a neighboring practical school of 
agriculture, or by governientally certified individuals. In localities 
where constant emigration exists, instruction may be imparted to 
pupils of the last year by qualified persons on the Government, in- 
dustries, social conditions, etc., of the countries to which such emi- 
gration tends, in 10 lessons outside the regular schedule. For each 
such course of instruction in hygiene, agriculture, and emigration a 
fee of 20 lire ($4) per year may be charged. The weekly schedule 
of the istituto magistrale shall not exceed 24 hours for any class, not 
including those devoted to singing and physical education. Details 
of the order of subjects, etc., shall be determined by the subsequent 
ministerial regulations. 
4. Annexed practice schools—To every istituto magistrale shall 
be annexed for purposes of practice teaching at least. one complete 
grade of the elementary or popular school, under the direction of 
the head of the éstituto; and if there are more than three sections 
of these there shall be annexed one additional grade of the practice 
school for each section. To every women’s és¢ituto there shall be 
annexed one class at least of the asili infantili, it being left to 
ministerial regulation to reorganize the existing Freebelian classes 
in accordance with the needs of the éséétuto. Subject to the general 
oversight of the head of the istituto, the management of the annexed 
practice schools :shall be entrusted to the professor of pedagogy, 
except that the courses in mathematics, physical and natural sciences 
in such practice schools shall be entrusted to the teacher of these 
sciences. In instructional matters the teacher of pedagogy shall be 
assisted by the professor of manual arts and drawing in such manner 
as shall be determined by ministerial decree. 
5. Admission to the istituti magistrali—Admission. to. the. first 
class of the women’s seven-year course shall be the same as. that 
required for admission to the first. class of the middle schools. of 
the first grade; to all other classes by promotion examination. _,,, 
Admission to the first class of the men’s four-year istituto shall 
be by certificate of promotion from the third to the fourth class of 
the ginnasi on the basis of the required examination; to all the 
other classes by promotion examination. 
 
-P-A-G-E-280
280 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
6. Relation to other schools—The relation between the several 
classes of the istituto magistrale and the other middle schools shall 
be determined by the Giunta of the Consiglio Superiore. Promotion 
shall be governed by the rules in force for the other middle schools; 
but examinations shall be obligatory throughout the school year, 
and in pedagogy and ethics up to the end of the next to the last year. 
A special examination on hygiene and agriculture is required at 
the end of the course. Passing of the yearly examinations upon 
singing and physical education is required for promotion and for the 
qualification for teaching. 
7. Diplomas, fees, ete—The istituti magistralt confer the diploma 
of qualification for teaching in elementary and popular schools 
upon the completion of the respective seven or four years’ courses. 
Candidates must have completed their eighteenth year. 
Graduated fees for admission, attendance, and examinations in 
various subjects and years are charged. 
8. Equipment.—Every istituto magistrale, both for men and 
women, shall be provided with (a) a scientific cabinet for instruc- 
tion and experiment, in charge of the respective teachers; (b) labo- 
ratories for manual arts, hygiene, agriculture, drawing, and practice 
teaching, each in charge of the respective teacher; (¢) a teachers’ 
“museum for instruction and practice teaching, in charge of the 
teacher of pedagogy; (d) a library and reading room, in charge of 
the teacher of history and geography; and (e) a well-equipped 
gymnasium and hall for teachers of physical education and singing. 
For expenses incurred under this head, 150,000 lire ($30,000) shall 
be appropriated for 1918-19, to be increased by 50,000 annually up 
to 300,000 lire. 
9. Maintenance—The Province in which the istituto is situated 
shall provide the site and building, the furniture and school equip- 
ment, exclusive of the strictly didactic apparatus detailed above, 
and lighting and heating service. The commune in which the és¢i- 
tuto is situated shall provide the site, buildings, and equipments of 
the practice schools annexed, and the salaries of the teachers em- 
ployed in them. The Government shall provide the salaries of the 
teaching personnel of the is¢ctuto itself. 
10. Teachers.—The teachers of the istituto shall be as follows, with 
the grouping of subjects as indicated: 
One teacher (Class A?) of pedagogy, ethics, and practice teach- 
ing; 3 teachers (2 of Class A and 1 of Class B) of the Italian lan- 
guage, literature and history, and geography; 1 teacher (Class A) 
of French; 1 teacher (Class A) of natural sciences; 1 teacher (Class   
1By Class A are denoted incumbents of the full chair, with complete control of subject 
and methods. By Classes B and C are denoted assistants and subordinates, responsible 
to higher authority, :

A) of manual arts; 1 teacher (Class B) of drawing and penman- 
ship; 1 teacher (Class B) of domestic arts; 1 teacher (Class C) of 
physical education; and 1 instructor of hygiene and singing. 
If in women’s istituto, 1 teacher, of Class B, of domestic arts, and 
1 mistress of the infant class. 
Especial care shall be had in the selection of the teacher of manual 
arts. He shall be selected only by competitive examination and 
must be a person holding the regular qualifying degree in manual 
arts; or, under temporary provisions of the ministerial regulation, 
a person who has for four years taken summer courses in these sub- 
jects, with successful qualifying examinations. For the men’s is¢i- 
tuto, also, an instructor in agriculture is required. With the view 
of ultimately establishing distinctive schools of manual arts, provi- 
sion shall be made in the men’s éstituto, in the discretion of the 
Consiglio Superiore, for two years’ courses in manual arts, embracing 
practical exercises, mechanics, technical training, drawing, and the 
history and theory of manual-arts education. 
11, Application of the law.—The present law, in its practical ef- 
fects and modifications of groups of studies, shall be gradually ap- 
plied from the beginning of the school year of 1918-19, in accordance 
with specific regulations to be promulgated by the Consiglio Su- , 
periore. Administrative heads of the present normal schools shall 
be ex officio heads of the new istituti magistrali. 
Despite some points on which there is a difference of opinion 
among educational thinkers—as, for example, the organic grouping 
of Italian history and geography in one chair—the spirit and pro- 
visions of the projected law receive practically universal approval 
throughout Italy. It is regarded as realizing reforms long needed 
in the training of teachers, especially in the following respects: In 
prolonging the course of study, in reducing the excessive number of 
hours of weekly schedule, in abolishing pretentious striving after 
effect, in combining related courses of instruction, in organically 
correlating them, and so leading the pupil up to the concentration 
upon exclusively pedagogical subjects during the last year. The 
consensus of opinion is that while a more radical project for the 
training of teachers might have been presented, the one actually 
formulated is practical and feasible, and, while not too far in ad- 
vance of the existing system, yet marks a long step forward in secur- 
ing a national body of ‘teachers better trained than any preceding 
one. 
(d) GINNASI AND LICEI. 
The wave of criticism directed against the various grades of edu- 
cation did not stop short of the traditional, and by their very nature, 
conservative middle schools of these titles. Appealing as they do
-P-A-G-E-282
  282 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
almost exclusively to boys intended for the universities and the pro- 
fessions, they have more steadily and successfully resisted all inno- 
yating projects than any other type. However, even the traditional 
ginnasio-liceo of the classical type, while it has maintained intact 
its eight years of prevailingly cultural character with emphasis 
upon the ancient classics, has yet had to accept one hour additional 
weekly in history throughout the course, an hour additional in 
mathematics for two years, and compulsory study of physics, chem- 
istry, and physical education. These modifications were the work 
of the Consiglio Superiore, in 1917, which thus sought to adapt 
this type of institution to the urgent needs of additional instruc- 
tion in sciences brought out by the war. Furthermore, criticism of 
static conditions shown by the enrollment of schools of this narrow 
type as contrasted with the far younger technical schools of the 
same grade had its effect in the demand for change. It was pointed 
out that the 458 schools of the traditional type, scattered over Italy, 
enrolled only 13,000 more pupils in 1917 than they did in 1901— 
54,000 against 44,000; whereas the newer technical schools, number- 
ing 461 and existing only in central and northern Italy, had ad- 
vanced from 50,621 pupils in 1901 to 182,194 in 1917. 
Italian critics of this traditional type of school maintain that its 
chief weakness is the excessive extension of the programs of study, 
due to the desire of the educational authorities to please both parties 
and to impart at once a general and a special culture. -Out of this 
very complexity has grown, however, an institution of a very useful 
nature, and one that, properly modified, bids fair to arrive at a happy 
mean intermediate between the two systems of training. This is the 
institution denominated since 1911 the ginnasio-liceo moderno, and 
approaching closely the type of scientific high school in America. 
By a species of compromise, the Consiglio Superiore in 1917 in- 
creased the total number of hours of instruction in Latin to 41, the 
largest assigned any one subject, but. at the same time it increased 
the requirements in modern languages by one hour weekly in each 
throughout the entire course, allowed alternation between English 
and German, and increased the already existent scientific require- 
ments. Despite the demand in this as in other fields for the diminu- 
tion of hours of weekly recitation the excessive number already ex- 
isting was left untouched even in the ginnasi-licet moderni, ranging 
from 22 to 27 or 28 hours, thus affording proof of its unchanged con- 
servatism, 
Discussion of the modifications in the middle school best adapted 
to suit needs after the war has already arisen. It is agreed that 
more attention must:be paid the sciences, modern languages,:and the 
modern sociological subjects; that the undue preponderance of ex- 
aminations must be.abolished, with transfer of emphasis to the daily
-P-A-G-E-283
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 283 
tasks; that the excessive number of pupils assigned to each teacher 
must be decreased to 30 or 40; and that better training must be de- 
manded for teachers. , 
IV. UNIVERSITIES AND HIGHER EDUCATION. 
While no fundamental university reform, projected or actual, is 
to be chronicled for the past two years as in the case of other 
branches of education in Italy, yet in spirit the universities have sus- 
tained significant changes in adapting themselves heartily to the war 
needs of the nation. It is safe to say that no other intellectual in- 
fluence has been so powerful in waking the nation to a just conception 
of the historical and ethnological reasons for Italy’s entrance into 
the war, and in keeping alive the sentiments of patriotism and con- 
secration to duty as has been that of the universities. The first 
meeting of the National Association of University Professors to be 
held under war conditions gathered in Rome in December, 1916. The 
subjects proposed for discussion reflected the new and vigorous spirit 
that had come to be infused into the ancient seats of learning: ‘ 
1. The future of the Italian book, and the ways and means of 
developing the national publication of literary and scientific mate- 
rial. 
2. Methods of fuller participation by the universities in the aims 
and prosecution of the war. . 
3. The attracting of foreign students to Italian universities, and 
the proper rating to be given them for work presented. 
4. The development of a national system of science, with endow- 
ments of scientific museums, cabinets, and. laboratories. 
5. Fundamental reforms in university administration and instruc- 
tion relative to war needs, especially. in the schools of pedagogy, the 
literatures of allied countries, and the applied sciences. 
6. War-time preparation to be required of entering students. 
7. Reasons for the resumption of the competitions for university 
chairs falling vacant, the naming of the rectors by the ministry ~ 
only for the period of the war, and guarantees of impartial hearing 
of university professors under charges before impartial and com- 
petent authorities,.and a system of international interchange of pro- 
fessors. 
Formulated reports embodying the sentiment of the association 
upon these topics were transmitted for the approval of the minister 
and for his support for legal enactment. 
In the essentially instructional domain, of interest is the concerted 
move to enlarge and extend the teaching of modern languages in 
many of the larger Italian universities. Fostered by the Minister 
of Public Instruction and the Consiglio Superiore, especial efforts 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
    284 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
have been made to establish chairs of English language and litera- 
ture, with immediate installation of “lectors” for a limited period 
of service, thus allowing time and opportunity to secure men of 
eminent attainments for permanent professorships. In the modern 
languages the courses of instruction are of the same standard as 
those for Latin and Greek, except that in addition to the teaching 
professor, a lecturer is engaged so that students may perfect them- 
selves in the actual pronunciation and use of the language. By 
decree of the Minister of Public Instruction, issued in November, 
1918, eight university chairs of English language and literature were 
established, the designation of the particular universities being re- 
served. The Universities of Bologna and Turin have already estab- 
lished courses for the study of French, English, Spanish, and 
German. : 
Of even greater importance were the recommendations of the 
special committee appointed upon the project of a special scientific 
baccalaureate. These were approved by the minister and by him 
transmitted to the Consiglior Superiore. As finally amended March, 
1917, their main outlines were as follows: 
1. In addition to existent degrees not affected by this regulation, 
the royal universities are empowered to confer on Italians as well as 
foreigners a special degree based on specific scientific training and 
studies freely chosen in accordance with these recommendations. 
Except in case of approved equivalence such special degree shal] not 
have the value of professional qualifications, nor for admission to 
competition for posts in official service. 
2. The studies for the attainment of the special degreé shall have 
a duration of at least four years and embrace at least 12 duly cer- 
tified courses, chosen by the candidate in the several faculties or 
schools. For such courses shall be counted only those specially 
related to the sciences, to be taken contemporaneously under diverse 
teachers or successively under the same teacher and leading uni- 
formly to the development of one general theme. The years of in- 
struction followed in foreign institutions are counted as by the rules 
hitherto in force; and for a fourth of the course to be pursued 
enrollment in the courses of the free universities may be counted 
when the programs and the development are adjudged of equal 
value for the ends contemplated in this regulation. 
8. Not iater than the end of the third year of his studies the 
candidate must indicate the group in which he intends to take his 
degree, the course pursued, and those he intends to pursue. All 
details are left to the discretion of the teachers of the special group 
concerned, 
4. The student, upon completion of his studies and presentation 
of the dissertation, shall be admitted to the examinations under the
-P-A-G-E-285
  
EDUCATION IN ITALY. 285 
rules in force governing degrees, which shall still be in force in all 
matters not expressly mentioned in this regulation. 
The council of ministers enacted the recommendation into a royal 
decree, but only as applying to foreign students. Subsequently rec- 
ognizing that this action denied to native students privileges granted 
to foreigners, they engaged at an early date to resume action upon it. 
Further administrative action necessitated by the war was taken in 
decrees of the minister and consiglio superiore providing for special 
dates and places of examinations for university and higher secondary 
students in military service convenient of access to posts and family 
residences; conceding to all students enrolled under professional 
and advanced academic faculties and called to service formal enroll- 
ment for 1915-6 in the immediately higher courses as if actually 
present; and admitting to any institution of higher grade, without 
fees, students from the invaded territories or from allied countries 
as a result of war conditions upon evidence of satisfactory attain- 
ments. 
Noteworthy is the inauguration, in 1917, of a “summer course in 
the Italian language and literature for foreigners of the allied na- 
tions,” located in Siena. No other studies than those of language 
were offered. Courses were as follows, each of two hours weekly: 
Italian grammar, reading and pronunciation, readings in Dante, his- 
tory of Italian literature, history of art, practical exercises in trans- 
lation, correction of themes, and professors’ conferences. Instructors 
were drawn from the faculty of the Royal University of Siena and 
from the teaching corps of the local ginnasio-liceo and the royal nor- 
mal school. Social and archeological features planned were excur- 
sions to monuments, buildings, and historical scenes in the vicinity. 
The use of all facilities of the local educational institutions was 
freely accorded. 
By royal decree of December, 1917, the exchange of teachers be- 
tween the royal middle and normal schools of Italy and the sec- 
ondary higher schools of France was arranged for. The Italian 
teacher is to receive a compensation of not more than 2,500 lire 
($500), in the discretion of the Minister of Public Instruction, an 
allowance of as much as 30 per cent of his regular salary, and travel- 
ing expenses. The same purpose is manifest in the wider field of the 
Associazione italiana per Vintesa intellettuale fra i paesi alleati ed 
amici (Italian Society for Intellectual Relations between Allied and 
Friendly Countries), founded in 1917 at the University of Rome. 
Its president is Senator V. Volterra, and the names best known in 
the literature of Italy are represented in the committee which directs 
its work and in the trimestral review setting forth its work. Its aims 
are as follows: 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  
286 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
(1) More active relations between the universities, academies, and, 
in general, educational institutions of the allied and friendly coun- 
tries. 
(2) Intensification of the teaching of the Italian language in for- 
eign countries, with wider teaching of the languages of allied and 
friendly countries in Italy. 
(8) International exchange of teachers of every rank. 
(4) Acknowledgment, based on reciprocity, of credits of admission 
to the universities and of the courses of lectures of the friendly and 
allied countries. 
(5) Exchange of students either for special studies or for general 
acquaintance with the different countries. 
(6) Facilitation of the exchange of publications and books devoted 
to a better knowledge of modern Italian literature. 
(7) Translation of the best Italian works into other languages. 
(8) Mutual cooperation in the field of science and its practical 
applications, and specially in that of private and international law. 
(9) Intellectual relations of every kind to render more close, dura- 
ble, and fruitful the union of the souls of the nations who fought the 
battles of civilization together. 
At the beginning of 1918 the committee presented its plan’ of 
operation. It proposes to institute in the Ministry of Public In- 
struction an independent bureau which aims to promote and direct 
the exchange of teachers with foreign countries, to send abroad 
Italian savants for the purpose of teaching or pursuing scientific 
and historical researches, to invite to Italy with kindred purposes 
foreign teachers or students, to regulate and assign the matter of 
international fellowships, to provide eventually for the foundation 
of Italian institutes of higher education outside of the boundaries of 
Italy, and to favor in every way intellectual relations with the other 
nations. 
The bureau is to consist of a council and an executive committee, 
both presided over by the Minister of Public Instruction. In the 
council, composed of 21 members, the faculties of the universities, 
the Ministry of Public Instruction with the two directors general 
of higher and middle instruction, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, 
of Agriculture, and of Industry and Commerce, and the Parliament, 
are all duly represented. Representatives of private educational and 
intellectual agencies outside the school and state administration 
may be included at the discretion of the Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion. The executive committee, composed of seven members and 
elected by the council from its own members, is charged with all 
practical details. 
The Italian teachers who go abroad for research or for study, 
according to the plans of the bureau and with the approval of the 
   
-P-A-G-E-287
  EDUCATION IN ITALY. 287 
ministry, are distributed in three classes according to the probable 
or actual period of absence from the Kingdom—those for less than 
one year, others for more than one year and less than five years, 
and still others for a longer term. Foreigners teaching in Italy shall 
have conferred upon them the dignity of the Italian professor of 
equal rank, and under certain conditions legal validity is given the 
course of lectures conducted by them. 
The projected law also determines the value of the studies pursued 
outside the Kingdom, those pursued by foreigners in Italy, and the 
value and status of fellowships. In general the studies and exami- 
nations pursued in foreign countries in the State institutions or those 
of established reputation are accorded the same value as studies 
and examinations in equivalent schools of the Kingdom. The fel- 
lowships are not restricted, as hitherto, to graduates, but are granted 
also to university students doing special work in laboratories, libra- 
ries, and foreign archives. Every year a certain number of fellow- 
ships shall be granted students and graduates from the high schools, 
normal and professional schools and special institutes for a period of 
not more than two years of study abroad. 
To give a rapid development to this plan and cooperate with 
the State institutions in Italy and abroad for its accomplishment is 
now the most important task of the Italian Association and of such 
similar associations as may be established in allied and friendly 
countries.

  CHAPTER V. 
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 
By I. L. Kanpet. 
ContmNnTs.—-General tendencies—Secondary education—Training of secondary school- 
teachers—Separation of church and State, 
GENERAL TENDENCIES. 
The development of education in Germany during the past two 
years must. necessarily remain obscure until the sources of direct 
information are again opened up. From extracts and references 
here and there the educational situation does not appear to have 
been very happy, and, if reports such as the following may be 
trusted, the machinery so carefully built up seems to have failed at 
the crisis. Writing in the Vossische Zeitung of January 23, 1918, 
Dr. Paul Hildebrandt contrasts the early enthusiasm manifested by 
the German school children and their war activities with the situation 
at the beginning of the year (1918) : 
The sixth-grade pupils of 1914 are now about to be promoted to the upper 
third. They have become accustomed to the war. Who can wonder, then, that 
now in the fourth year of war our children exhibit signs of change? Too many 
of the restraints have been removed which should shape their developments; 
the loosening of family ties, the father at the front, the mother employed away 
from home, and in the lower ranks of society doing the work of men; the 
relaxation of school discipline. Of the teachers of the Berlin public schools, 
for instance, two thirds have gone into the army. ‘The remainder are over- 
worked. Dropping class periods, or combining classes together is the order 
of the day. In the higher schools half of the teachers are in the army. Further- 
more, standards in the higher institutions of learning have gradually been 
lowered until the final examination has been pushed back fully two classes. 
All of these conditions have influenced our students and have weakened their 
persistence, since they see that they can attain a scholastic standing without 
effort that formerly demanded the severest application. 
Young people follow the law of their nature. They are guided by the im- 
pressions of the moment and they can not permanently resist them. Im addi- 
tion, as time went on, especially in the case of students of higher institutions, 
and particularly in the towns, the hardship of inadequate nourishment ap- 
peared. It is the unanimous judgment of medical specialists that the children 
of the middle classes suffered most in this respect. General attention was 
attracted to the fact that the children were less sensitive to reproof, that they 
paid no more attention to threats, because the school authorities had directed 
that they should be treated with every leniency, and since promotions no longer 
represented any definite standard of accomplishment. This special considera- 
tion for the children was most obvious in the schools of the large cities. Was 
171030°—21—Bull. 89-19 289
-P-A-G-E-290
290 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
not harvest work and the country vacation necessary to maintain the health 
of the coming generation, and was it not necessary for a great many to be set 
back in their studies so that they required repeated concessions to maintain 
their rank and thereby continually lower scholastic standards of their classes? 
That spirit of voluntary service which at the beginning of the war re- 
vealed itself in its fairest aspect has now disappeared. Everywhere we hear 
lamentations over the increasing distaste shown for military services. Pupils 
collect articles now for the reward, not from patriotism, and the older pupils 
have their struggles. Shall they take advantage of the opportunity to leave 
school with a half-completed education, or shall they avoid placing themselves 
in a position where they will have to enlist for their country? What an un- 
happy indecision even for the best of them, those who really think about the 
matter. > s 
Furthermore, in those ranks of society which are less influenced by tradition, 
discipline, and education, we find increasing violations of the law. At the first 
this manifested itself merely in an increase of theft. More recently it has 
taken a decided turn toward personal assaults. It is true, the latter are still 
negligible in proportion to the total number of juvenile offenses, but they are 
increasing every year. Already the number of violent crimes committed by 
youths in the city of Berlin is more than three times the number reported 
in 1914. 
Thus, dark shadows are falling over the brilliant picture of 1914. Every 
disciplinary influence, every effort of the still fundamentally sound German 
nation must be exerted to oppose this tendency, and to lead the children back 
to the path of rectitude. 
Another picture, but one also indicating the difficulties that attend 
the conduct of the schools, is given in the Leipziger Volkszeitung for 
February 8, 1918. 
The Saxon minister of education recently drew attention in the Saxon Diet 
to the injurious effects produced by the war on the elementary schools of the 
Kingdom. In addition to the shortage of fuel, which last year frequently 
necessitated the closing of schools, and this year has required the removal and 
amalgamation of whole schools, the unsatisfactory health of the teachers has 
had an undesirable effect. 
War conditions, according to the minister, have caused great emaciation and 
premature ageing, and have diminished the capacity for work (alike physical 
and intellectual) and the sharpness of the senses. This state of things is 
attributed not only to the food supply situation, but also to the increased diffi- 
: culty and extent of the professional work falling upon teachers (only 8,965 ele- 
mentary school teachers were at work in Saxony on ist of October, 1917, as 
compared with 14,800 before the war), and to the large amount of auxiliary 
service imposed upon teachers in connection with war economic measures, 
  These accounts hardly seem to be in keeping with the eulogies 
heaped on the German school system during the first two years of the 
war in the daily press, in professional magazines and by the Govern- 
ment. It was then felt very universally that the elementary school, 
the training ground of the discipline and physical strength and com- 
prehensive culture that characterize the German soldier, had tri- 
umphed signally over the illiterate Russians and Italians, as well as 
the decadent French and the treacherous English, It was the elemen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 291 
tary schools that produced the patriotic, loyal, thorough soldier 
whom the consciousness of a good cause carried to victory. This un- 
guarded flattery of the elementary schools and their teachers helped 
somewhat to give a new impetus to a movement to which attention 
had been redirected just before the war. At an educational confer- 
ence which met at Kiel in June, 1914, and was attended by 
representatives of all branches of education, it was urged with much 
enthusiasm that on the basis of a national common school higher edu- 
cation be made accessible to as many classes in society as possible so 
that intelligence might be recruited wherever it was found. Oppor- 
tunity for ability could best be furnished through the establishment 
of the Einheitsschule or common school system. The program also 
included the unification of all branches of the teaching profession 
with the further implication of a uniform system of training for all 
and equal access for all to the highest positions in the educational 
profession. The elimination of social and sectarian distinction is an- 
other plank in the platform for educational reorganization. 
The idea of the Hinheitsschule has a long history in Germany; it 
has always been advocated by the leaders of progressive politics and 
thoughtful educators. When last agitated in the eighties, Prof. 
Rein and Mr. J. Tews, now the doyen of the elementary school 
teachers, were associated with the movement as they now are with 
its revival. The principle underlying the system of the Einheits- 
schule is that all children between the ages of 6 and 12 shall have 
a common educational foundation to be followed by educational 
opportunities thereafter suited to their abilities. This implies the 
elimination of the Vorschule, or special fee-paying school, which 
prepares pupils from the age of 6 until their entrance into the 
secondary school at about the age of 9 and which is a distinctly class 
school. The further implication of the Einheitsschule is the post- 
ponement of the beginning of secondary education to 12, a change 
that has much to commend it on grounds other than the provision 
of democratic opportunities, and is at least a better age at which 
a correct choice of a course and a career can be made than 9.1 
A new stimulus was given to the movement in the early days of 
the war, when politics was adjourned, when enthusiasm and victory 
had welded the Nation together as one, and when Hindenburg was 
claimed to be superior to Hannibal and the captain of the Emden to 
Leonidas. The commercial and industrial classes had, it was gener- 
ally felt, proved themselves equal to the demands of the hour. The 
greatest inability to meet the situation had been shown by the politi-   
1The present account is based on a study of the movement in the Pddagogische Zeitung 
between 1914-1916, when direct information ceased to be accessible. A valuable analysis 
of contemporary educational literature is contained in an article on Les Projets de 
Réformes Scolaires en Allemagne, in Revue Pédagogique, Vol. 69, pp. 250-267, September, 
1916; and Vol. 70, pp. 498-517, May, 1917.

cal and diplomatic leaders who had enjoyed the traditional oppor- 
tunities for higher education. The demand was at once renewed 
for the establishment of a common school from which pupils of 
promise in all classes of society might be recruited to place their 
intellectual abilities at the service of the state and to furnish an 
intellectual and spiritual reserve to make up for the physical and 
intellectual losses incurred during the war. It was no longer a ques- 
tion of providing an easy road (Bahn leicht) for ability but an 
open road (Bahn frei). 
The war changed the aspects of the problem; the need of the 
hour was a German national school with opportunity for all to 
cooperate in promoting the great aims of the German cultural state. 
National unity could only be advanced by a national common school, 
which, according to the progressives, including the Deutsche Leh- 
rerverein and the social democrats, must be established as a free, 
undenominational and nationally uniform institution placing gifted 
children of the poorer classes on the same footing for promotion to 
higher education as the children of the richer classes. Cultural and 
social equality must be established for the working classes who were 
anxious to play their proper part in the development of common 
national aims. They desired not so much to reach the top, but that 
their abler members should have opportunities opened to them suited 
to their ability without reference to school privileges and certificates. 
For the member of the working classes the question is not so 
much, “ How can I raise my son socially through education?” as 
“How can I secure for my class or rather its abler members appro- 
priate influence in the adminstration of the state and of the commu- 
nity, in industry, commerce, transport, and how can I put an end 
to the influences of privilege that are socially detrimental?” Selec- 
tion for educational advantages must in the future be based in the 
opinion of the advocates of the movement not on privilege but on the 
common right of all classes. The proposals for the Einheitsschule 
are well summarized in a resolution passed in June, 1918, by the Asso- 
ciation of Prussian Women Teachers, meeting at Hannover: 
. National unity, returning stronger than ever after the war, will demand a 
unified school system for all Germany. The reconstruction of the whole sys- 
tem’ will have to be made with a single compulsory elementary school as its 
foundation. Reasons for this are of different kinds; reasons of social justice, 
that every gifted child shall be able to advance to a higher education; national 
and economical reasons, that the state shall be able to make use of all native 
talent in the most suitable place, and shall be able to economize in the heavy 
and useless expenses which are incurred by the presence of poorly endowed 
scholars in the secondary schools. 
Karl Muthesius, long a leader in educational affairs, is opposed to 
class barriers and restrictions on intellectual development merely 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 293 
because of poverty. The elementary school up to 12 must be the 
national school offering a common foundation for all; beyond this 
opportunities must be created for differentiation according to the 
needs of the individual and of the nation. The common school must 
be free from clerical control and permitted to be self-directing. He 
expresses his opposition to the classical tradition in days when 
German culture is fully developed to furnish a sound basis for educa- 
tion. Prof. Rein, in a work by Fr. Thimme, in which are collected 
the opinions of leading Germans on the subject under discussion, de- 
clares himself most emphatically, as might be expected, in favor of 
the common school, whose establishment would make a real and 
effectual contribution to the development of national feeling in the 
hearts of/all children. Such an organization would give inner unity 
to the whole system of moral culture in Germany. 
Dr. Kerschensteiner? approaches the whole question of reform 
from a broader standpoint than any other of its advocates. He not 
only questions the existing basis and aims of education, but seeks 
to bring the reform into line with the modern needs of society. The 
acquisition of knowledge is a secondary and subordinate end; the 
school’s essential task is to make men capable of devotion to the cause 
of society and of humanity. Character, moral courage, energy, and 
sense of civic duty are qualities that are more vital than mere in- 
formation. Contrary to prevailing thought among his countrymen 
he opposes the theory that the state is a separate entity existing 
apart from the individuals composing it. He accepts the Roman and 
Anglo-Saxon view that the state is an association of individuals 
organized to promote and protect the interests of all, In such a state 
the free and willing collaboration of citizens should mean the elimina- 
tion of restraint and coercion. 
The educational implication, according to Kerschensteiner, is that 
“it is essential that the school should cease to be the playground of 
individual ambitions and egoisms, in order that it may become the 
home of social devotion.” The aim should not be intellectual culture 
or knowledge for its own sake but training for human intercourse and 
just action. The sense of civic duty can only be called forth in a state 
that furnishes scope for the development of personality. “If we 
wish to realize the true civic spirit, we must subdue the narrow 
national spirit.” The school must accordingly fulfil a twofold 
duty—it must take account of individual differences and at the same 
time keep in the foreground the universal element—practical con-

The state, says Kerschensteiner, must guarantee the right of 
every child to an education suited to his ability. He combats all the 
arguments of opponents of this movement—overcrowding of second- 
ary schools, difficulty of selection, lowering of standards, increase of 
the intellectual proletariat, and the danger of social conflicts. The 
Hinheitsschule should, therefore, be an educational institution for 
all up to the age of 22 or 24, with selection all along the line accord- 
ing to individual differences. Unlike Rein, Kerschensteiner does 
not desire to keep all children together as long as possible but would 
begin to differentiate as soon as individual bent appears. For such 
a system flexibility and elasticity are indispensable; bureaucratic 
control and uniformity are dangerous. Selection might begin at as 
early an age as nine, when those who show intellectual aptitude may 
be transferred to secondary schools. For those who remain in the 
elementary school variety may be afforded by a departmental system. 
There should be transfers back and forth between schools and depart- 
ments to give the individual every opportunity for realizing himself. 
But whether a child remains in an elementary school or goes on 
to a secondary or vocational school, the fundamental task of educa-' 
tion continues to be the preparation of citizens; the civic spirit must 
saturate the whole of education; not the ua shake on nationalism 
or on German language and literature, but the sovereign idea of 
preparation of all for society, can successfully promote the desired 
end. Education is a State function, and since the State has claims 
superior to those of smaller groups and societies, it should have the 
right to arbitrate and decide between conflicting interests, without, 
however, ignoring particular characteristics. Centralization that is 
too strict will stifle local effort and individual initiative; competi- 
tion and rivalry are essential to life and progress. 
Opposition to these claims was immediately aroused and came 
from the secondary schools, teachers of traditional subjects, school 
inspectors, administrative officials, and the clerical and conservative 
elements in politics. The secondary-school teachers in general feared 
overcrowding of their schools. The specialists were alarmed at the 
thought of the postponement of the beginning of secondary educa- 
tion from the age of 9 to 12 and the consequent lowering of standards. 
The inspectors and administrative official produced arguments 
against. a radical change based on considerations of the good of the 
lower classes; higher education would only lead to unrest and discon- 
tent, to dissatisfaction with the social position of parents, and am- 
bitions for higher positions that are limited in number; pupils from 
poorer homes and humbler environments do not enjoy the same ad- 
vantages and opportunities that are possesséd by the children of the 
upper classes—a condition that in itself might be fraught with danger 
consequent on the sudden transfer from a humble to a higher status.

  ‘EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 295 
In any case the work of the elementary schools furnishes no cri- 
terion for the selection of pupils for advancement to higher educa- 
tion, so that early selection would be surrounded with risk for the 
aspiring pupil, while no account would be taken of or provision made 
for late development. It would also be unjust to the elementary 
school teachers to deprive them of the pick of their product and the 
promotion of gifted pupils would mean the withdrawal of an ever- 
present incentive to the less well endowed. If the views of the radicals 
were realized and the selection of able pupils for advancement to sec- 
ondary schools were made by the schools, the rights of parents would 
be outraged; at the most all that the schools should do would be to 
advise parents and allow them to act if they choose. The fear was 
also expressed by no less an authority than Rudolf Eucken that the 
realization of the common-school proposal would endanger traditional 
values in school, lower standards, compromise the precious things 
of German culture, and in the last analysis lead to the establishment 
of private schools and the perpetuation of a social class to preserve 
these heritages. Curt Fritzsche,t in a work on the Einheitsschule, 
claims to see the purport of the whole movement in the reception ac- 
corded at the Kiel congress of 1914 to the declaration of two French 
delegates that it represented the international ideal common to all 
Europe—clearly the aims of the movement are internationalism, de- 
mocratization, radicalism, antireligious secularization, egoism, and 
social feuds. 
Finally, Ferdinand J. Schmidt, professor of education at the 
University of Berlin, attacks the movement in an article in Preus- 
sische Jahrbiicher, October, 1916. He charges the reformers with 
basing their agitation on political prejudices and class interests. 
The proposal to establish an extended unified school system, with six 
years of elementary education, three years of intermediate and three 
of secondary, without distinction for all would lower the standard to 
meet the needs of the poorest intellect; it would tend to a reduction 
of the elementary school subjects, and, by consequence, would lower 
the standards of the secondary schools. Foreign languages would 
be begun too late, and the boy going out into the world at the age 
of 15 would have studied French or English for only one year; ulti- 
mately languages would disappear entirely from the intermediate 
stage and with them the most effectual instrument for broadening 
the mind would be gone. The reformers are the dupes of a pedagogic 
materialism which would be disastrous to the nation in diverting the 
aim of education from its true goal—moral culture. Emphasis would 
then only be placed on developing those qualities and those abilities 
that would yield most profit.

This is the American method in education with all its dangers, The reform 
would not result in social equality; class distinctions continue even in coun- 
tries that have a unified school system open to all. By boundlessly developing 
the understanding, which divides and separates, by releasing, without check or 
hindrance, the intellectual abilities of individuals, by freeing them from that 
wholesome and indispensable discipline of social morality, they are bringing 
about, with the best intentions in the world, the overthrow and dismemberment 
of national unity. 
Early in 1916 the subject came within the realm of practical poli- 
tics when the educational estimates for 1916-17 were brought up for 
debate in the Prussian House of Representatives (Abgeordneten- 
haus). The Social Democrats and the Progressive Volkspartei came 
forward with a demand for the abolition of the Vorschule and the 
throwing open of opportunities for ability in whatever grade of 
society it might appear. The Vorschule is merely a school for those 
privileged by class, who made no other use of their educational oppor- 
tunity than to advance as far as the Hinjiihrigenzeugnis. If the 
principle of the Einheitsschule were adopted the best pupils would 
pass on completion of their elementary school course to the secondary 
school and in five or six years obtain the Reifezeugnis or certificate 
of maturity that would admit them to the universities. Both pro- 
posals met with opposition from the conservatives and the clericals 
who feared that the common-school movement would involve seculari- 
zation. They were prepared to grant one concession that the transfer 
of pupils from the elementary to the secondary schools should be 
made as easy as that from the Vorschule. On behalf of the Govern- 
ment the minister of education admitted the need of establishing 
facilities for transferring able pupils from the elementary to the 
secondary schools and suggested the organization of a Mittelschule 
for this purpose. He referred to an experiment that had already 
been conducted in Berlin whereby pupils from elementary schools 
were transferred to the Quarta class or third year of the Realschule 
and in four years attained to the Einjihrigenzeugnis. Such pupils 
could then move on to the Oberrealschule and at 19 or 20 be ready to 
pass on to the universities. 
In the course of 1916 announcements appeared in the press that the 
ministry of education was preparing regulations to enable fit and 
selected pupils, after three years in an elementary school, to be trans- 
ferred without further examination to a secondary school, thus en- 
joying practically the same privilege as the pupils of the Vorschule, 
with the difference that, if found deficient, they could be returned to 
the elementary grades. This proposal met with a storm of opposi- 
tion; it was feared that the secondary schools would be invaded and 
that the teachers and principals of these schools would not have the 
power to turn pupils back to the elementary schools. The result was
-P-A-G-E-297

that the ministry denied that it was even considering such a sugges- 
tion, and stated that it was merely planning to codify the regulations 
for the entrance examinations to secondary schools which had re- 
mained unchanged since 1837. When the new regulations were issued 
in August, it was found that they benefitted the Vorschule rather 
than the elementary schools. 
The question of the Einheitsschule again came up in the course of 
the debate on the estimates for 1917-18 and the Government was then 
compelled to act. The position of the minister of education showed 
clearly that the ground had been shifted. From the consideration of 
the Einheitsschule and of plans for facilitating the transition from 
the elementary to the secondary school, the problem had been nar- 
rowed down to that of selecting gifted elementary school pupils for 
advancement to higher education. The minister announced that he 
had early in 1917 addressed the following questions to all district 
inspectors: a 
(a) In what elementary school organizations can a good pupil pass into 
sexta of a secondary sghool without necessitating special arrangements or alter- 
ations in the school program? 
(0) If such organizations do not exist, what changes would have to be made 
in the program to render these transfers possible? 
(ce) Can such changes be made without disadvantage to the other students? 
If not, suggestions should be made for special arrangements to meet the needs 
of the gifted pupil. 
It was announced that an experiment was being conducted by the 
Government at Kénigsberg and plans were in progress for dealing 
with the needs of gifted children in Berlin, Frankfort, Breslau, 
Mannheim, and Hamburg. 
The new movement for the selection of gifted and exceptional chil- 
dren seems to have had the effect of checking completely any further 
demands for the Einheitsschule. In the schools systems to which ref- 
erence is made above Begabtenschulen have been or are in process of 
being established, and it is not improbable that this compromise will 
be accepted by both sides. Nowhere has a common school been put 
into operation, and teachers’ associations appear to have been active 
in promoting the new experiments, which are limited to facilitating 
access to middle and secondary schools to gifted and exceptional 
(Begabten and Hochbegabten pupils) in elementary schools. 
In Berlin such an experiment was introduced on the suggestion of 
Geheimer Justizrat Cassel, a member of the Progressive Volkspartei, 
who urged, in the Prussian Abgeordnetenhaus, in 1916, the establish- 
ment of facilities in each province to enable pupils on finishing the 
elementary schools to continue to a higher school and reach the Reife- 
zeugnis or maturity certificate in five or six years. Such a plan, he 
stated, would be of advantage to children of poor parents in larger 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  298 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
cities as well as to children in small towns and rural areas who could 
enjoy the blessings of home influences up to 14. Dr. Reiman, the di- 
rector of education for Berlin, adopted the suggestion and the Begab- 
tenschule was established in 1917 for the admission of exceptional and 
studious pupils who have completed the first seven years of the ele- 
mentary school course. The work of the Begabtenschule begins with 
that of Untertertia of a secondary school; during the first year the 
pupils are under probation and, if they fail to meet the standards, may 
be discharged, that is, at the age at which they would ordinarily have 
reached the close of the compulsory attendance period. After two 
years, that is after Untersekunda, a choice is open between the course 
of a gymnasium or of a realgymnasium. The schools do not grant the 
privilege of one year military service, but after six years lead to the 
maturity certificate which admits to the university. The Begabten- 
schule is open to able pupils of all classes; fees are remitted for poor 
pupils, and books and, in case of need, maintenance grants up to 
300M ($75) a year are granted. The pupils must be recommended by 
their schools and are selected on the basis of psychological intelligence 
tests. The first tests were conducted by W. Moedé and C. Piorkowski, 
psychologists who had met with success in selecting motor transport 
drivers for the army by tests which were used in all sections of this 
branch of the service. This selection is based on tests of attention and 
concentration, memory, combinations, wealth of ideas, judgment, at- 
tention, and observation. The authors of these tests declare that 
“reviewing the precise results of the analytical and systematic tests, 
the professional psychologist can not refuse to accept the responsi- 
bility for his decisions based on good scientific principles.” Dr. Rei- 
mann plans to test pupils with artistic or technical bent and select 
them at 18 or 14 for higher trade schools to train as painters, jewelers, 
designers, embroiderers, cabinetmakers, lithographers, and other 
crafts. Dr. Rebhuhn has prepared an observation sheet which was 
presented by the Association for Exact Pedagogy to the city school 
board to be used by teachers as soon as pupils commence to show 
marked ability and to serve as a record from the second year up. 
A similar plan was inaugurated at Leipzig for boys, and provision 
will be made for girls. Special classes were established at a Reform 
School and an Oberrealschule, closely coordinated with the elemen- 
tary schools. The course begins in Untertertia with intensive study 
of French for three quarters of a year, when English or Latin is 
taken up. After another year the pupils are ready to take their 
place in the normal class of the school (Untersekunda). Tuition, 
books, and maintenance allowances are granted in case of need. Since 
the number of selected pupils is restricted to 20 each year, they are the 
very exceptional only (hervorragend Begabten). In order not to 
flood the academic and professional careers similar experiments will
-P-A-G-E-299
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 299 
be attempted in other schools, e. g., school of commerce, technical 
school, and trade schools. 
A somewhat different plan has been adopted at Hamburg, where 
it was originally intended to establish a transition or special class to 
coordinate the elementary secondary schools. In place of this, owing 
to the insistence of the teachers and the House of Burgesses, a new 
type of school is organized that avoids such half measures. At 10 
years of age; that is, on completing the fourth school year, pupils 
are specially selected for the new schools, of which 22 have been 
established (14 for boys and 8 for girls), to provide either a four- 
year German course or a five-year course with foreign languages. 
These schools are similar to the Prussian middle schools and carry 
the privilege of admission to certain higher trade schools and to the 
State examination for the one-year military privilege. The pupil 
who completes the course of such schools can by way of the Oberreal- 
schule or the Realgymnasium pass on to the universities. 
The selection of the gifted pupils is based partly on the psycho- 
logical observations by the teachers and psycholocical tests by an 
expert, for both of which Dr. W. Stern, of the Psychological Insti- 
tute, is responsible. The psychological observations are recorded in 
a specially prepared folder indicating the home conditions and school 
record of the pupil, his adaptability, attentiveness, susceptibility to 
fatigue, powers of observation and comprehension, memory, imagina- 
tion, thought, language, industry, disposition and will power, special 
interests, and abilities. The psychological tests include the logical 
arrangements of ideas, explanation of concepts, completion test, 
building of sentence on the basis of keywords, the derivation of the 
moral of a story, the discovery of logical absurdities, the finding of a 
legend for a series of pictures, and test of attentiveness. Stern 
claims that the cooperation of the teachers makes the Hamburg sys- 
tem superior to the Berlin plan of selecting on the basis of tests 
alone; it should also be mentioned that the selection in Hamburg is 
under the supervision of a committee of the superintendent, in- 
spectors, principals, teachers, and psychologists. For pupils who 
develop at a later stage than those for whom these arrangements are 
made transition classes have been established in two Realschulen in 
which after one year they can pass on to the last year of the school 
and qualify for the one-year military privilege. 
Breslau has established special classes for boys and girls of great 
ability (Hochbegabten) selected at about the age of 12 by a psycho- 
logical expert on the basis of intelligence tests similar to those used , 
in Hamburg. Pupils who succeed in these schools will be encouraged 
by the city to proceed along suitable lines. The city will look after 
the education of selected pupils, who could thus be under the observa-
-P-A-G-E-300
  300 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
tion of the psychologist until they pass into their chosen vocation. 
Facilities have been instituted in Charlottenburg to enable gifted 
pupils to advance more rapidly in the elementary schools and com- 
plete the work of a middle school. At Frankfort gifted pupils, on 
leaving the elementary schools, may be prepared in one year to enter 
Untersekunda of an Oberrealschule, and in four years to attain the 
Reifezeugnis. The Mannheim system is already well known in this 
country. 
The experiment is thus confined to the larger towns, and complaints 
are already heard that the state should take over the further develop- 
ment of such plans to bring them within the reach of all. In the 
meantime critics even of this precipitate of the more ambitious and 
more democratic movement for tlhe Einheitsschule are not wanting. 
There are those who express concern lest the gifted pupils become 
spoilt and conceited; that selection in itself would set up class distine- 
tions; that school ability is not necessarily a guarantee of ability in 
after life; that pupils should not be selected on the basis of school 
marks, but on the basis of character, pronounced bent, and moral 
force. Further, the plans involve the danger of robbing the lower 
classes of their intelligent members, of depriving industry of its 
abler workmen, and of overcrowding academic and professional 
careers. Finally, jawte de mieux, psychological tests are not yet suffi- 
ciently developed to serve as a basis of sound and scientific diagnosis, 
and are inadequate until they have found a more extensive place in 
the schools. It is clear that the mind of the German reactionary 
follows the same kind of logic in domestic as in foreign affairs, 
SECONDARY EDUCATION? 
The movement for the common school, in some of its aspects, in- 
volved the reconstruction of the secondary school or at least the 
organization of a new type based entirely on a purely nationalistic 
foundation and open to all without distinction. This agitation was 
reenforced from another direction. The successes at the front were 
felt to be due to the excellent technical preparation given in some 
schools and the continued collaboration of the leaders in the field 
of the applied sciences. At the same time the megalomania of the 
early period manifested itself not merely in a feeling of physical 
superiority but in a sense of moral and intellectual self-sufficiency 
that needed no reenforcement from external sources. There was 
still a third point from which the traditional curricula were sub-

jected to criticism—their failure to give a real preparation for the 
needs of modern life. The classical gymnasium in particular was 
attacked as an anachronism to be swept away as soon as possible and 
to be replaced by a genuine German nationalistic school adapted to the 
needs of to-day. To devote time to subjects that do not “ function” 
or pay is a gross mistake. The schools should teach things and not 
words, realities and not tradition. Business .men, practical poli- 
ticians, and nationalistic educators found themselves united in a 
campaign to secure a school that would bring up German citizens in 
a pure German way and that would make the German civic spirit the 
core of the curriculum. 
The charge is made. that the so-called reforms resulting from the 
Emperor’s conferences in 1890 and 1900 did not result in a modifi- 
cation of the gymnasium, where Latin and Greek still form the core 
of the curriculum with an emphasis on the grammatical and philo- 
logical elements. The pseudo-humanistic ideal of teaching nothing 
that is directly useful for life still animates such schools, which con- 
tinue as ever to be the homes of conservatism. “ Deutschtwm,? Ger- 
man ultur, must be the center around which secondary school studies 
should revolve. The classics may have been the roots of German 
Kultur, but Germany now possesses the fruit and flower in her own 
culture and that alone. So far as antiquities are concerned, a knowl- 
edge of them can in these days be readily obtained through photo- 
graphs, reproductions and models, and translations without the 
waste of time involved in studying grammar and rules. As for the 
disciplinary value of such studies, much better results can be obtained 
from mathematics. 
The same attitude was manifested on the question of the study of 
modern foreign languages, although the material loss that might be 
involved in their total abandonment made the discussion of the sub- 
ject a little more wary. It was argued that, since the enemy had 
evidently not taken the trouble to understand Germany, it was waste 
of time for Germans to attempt to study their languages. Statisti- 
cally it was proved that next to the English language German was 
the vernacular of the world and after the war English would inevi- 
tably be ousted. It was even proposed, and a motion to this effect 
in the Prussian Upper House met with the support of all the uni- 
versity representatives, that the languages of Germany’s eastern allies 
should be introduced into the schools. Flemish was added to the 
list subsequently. The more cautious were not so ready to see English 
and French ousted, and, while admitting that Germany could gain 
nothing culturally from the enemy languages, suggested that com- 
mercially it might still be found profitable to retain English and add 
Russian and Spanish as the languages necessary for Germany’s fu- 
ture commercial development. The one aim of the schools to-day
-P-A-G-E-302
  ; a 
802 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
should not be formal training but an education for life founded in 
moral idealism; there must be, as the Emperor had urged in 1890 and 
1900, “a more decided nationalization of secondary education” to. 
develop citizens of a German state. 
The blatancy of these claims was not allowed to pass unchallenged. 
The advocates of the classics protested strongly. Did the opponents 
wish to make Amerigans of the youth of the country “to dry up 
their dreams, and to turn boys of 15 into makers of machinery, into 
dentists, or into surgeons”? The German moral and intellectual 
forces of which all were proud were founded, it was claimed, on the 
ancient cultures. The particular character of German culture was 
derived from the cult of the classics. One secondary schoolmaster 
sums up the arguments of the classicists in the statement that “ Three 
persons have become one in us, the Greek, the Christian, and the 
German ”’—hence. each must have its place in the development of 
youth. Nor were there lacking students of modern foreign lan- 
guages to insist on their retention, but even here it was suggested 
that such languages and literatures be studied only in so far as 
they can contribute toward a clearer comprehension of German 
national culture. The attitude of the ministry of education on this 
subject -is indicated in an instruction of March 20, 1915, which per- 
mitted the employment in secondary schools of Germans expelled 
from France and England to teach the languages of those countries, 
even if they did not possess the prescribed qualifications or previous 
teaching experience. 
It is obvious that no matter what the opinion on any subject might 
be, all who entered into the discussion of educational values were 
unanimous in accepting the nationalistic aim. This aim was stimu- 
lated by the Government in various ways, direct and indirect. 
Teachers were urged immediately on the outbreak of the war to turm 
the attention of their students to the study of the war events and pa- 
trictic endeavor. The ministry of war with the support of the min- 
istry of education and other ministries interested in education urged 
the organization in schools and elsewhere of battalions and com- 
panies of boys of 15 or 16 (Jugendcompagnien, Jungmannen, Jung- 
mannschaften) for physical training and instruction as a preparation 
for military training. Militarism in these organizations was at first 
disavowed, but it began progressively to enter and by 1917 no secret. 
was made of their primary purpose.* 
The direct method for the inculcation of patriotism, national 
pride, and devotion to the dynasty was adopted by the ministry of 
education when on September 2, 1915, it issued its “ New Organiza- 
tion of the History Syllabus in Higher Schools of Prussia.” It ap- 
peared that the history syllabus for the secondary schools had 
  1See Friedel, op. cit., Chap. -IL,
-P-A-G-E-303
EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 808 
grown too cumbersome, so that it was impossible to handle it satis- 
factorily in the present overcrowded condition of the curriculum. 
“Since it is just the period from 1861 to the present that for us 
Prussians and Germans surpasses in importance everything else that 
has happened in the history of the world, the earlier periods must 
| be treated much more briefly and comprehensively, so that the history 
of the past 50 years can be dealt with in detail.” Under existing 
arrangements the modern period is not taken up until Untersekunda. 
The new regulations require Prussian-German history to be begun 
in Sexta and continued concentrically so that pupils will acquire a 
mastery of national history. The emphasis throughout it is urged 
should be on the outstanding character of the Hohenzollerns, more 
especially from the time of the Great Elector down to the present. 
Ancient and medieval history are retained but teachers are advised 
to dwell only on those movements whose influence has been more or 
less continuous. Briefly analyzed the suggested syllabus is as 
follows: 
Sexta—Stories from recent history. Quinta—Outline of Prussian‘German 
history. Quarta—Ancient and medieval history to about 476 A. D. Unter- 
tertia—History of Germany in Middle Ages to the middle of the seventeenth 
century. Obertertia—Amplifications of the outline given in Quinta at least to 
1870 or even the present day. Untersekunda—Review ancient history, begin 
Germany history, if not already begun in the previous class, and deal in detail 
with selected parts since 1870. Obersekunda—Close the ancient period and go 
on to the thirteenth century. Unterprima—German history up to Frederick the 
Great. Prima—German history from 1786 to the present. 
Some flexibility was permitted to the teachers in the organiza- 
tion of the work. The experiment was to be inaugurated at Easter, 
1916. By a prophetic anticipation the reports on this experiment 
in molding patriots to Hohenzollern standard were to be made in 
October, 1918. 
TRAINING OF SECONDARY-SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The system of training of teachers for secondary schools has been 
somewhat modified by new regulations issued in June, 1917. The 
rules for the admission of candidates remain unchanged. At the 
close of the necessary period of university study of four years candi- 
dates are required to undergo a general examination (Wéssenschaft- 
liche Priifung). This examination is conducted by a special board 
(Wissenschafiliches Priifungsamt), which includes university in- 
structors and schoolmen. The paper in general knowledge is 
abolished, but every candidate is examined in philosophy with 
special reference to education, including psychology, logic, and ethics 
related in particular to child life. Familiarity must be shown with
-P-A-G-E-304
  304 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
the works of the leading writers in the special branch of philosophy 
bearing on education and with its place in the history of philosophy. 
This general examination is followed by examinations in the special 
fields selected by the candidate from the following subjects: Christian 
theology, German, Latin, Greek, Hebrew (only as a minor), French, 
English, history, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, botany, 
and zoology. Of these subjects two, instead of one as hitherto, must 
be taken as majors and one as a minor. An innovation is the addi- 
tion of a large number of supplementary subjects that may be sub- 
stituted for the minor. These include philosophical propedeutics, 
pedagogy, applicd mathematics, mineralogy and geology, classical 
archaeology, history of art in the Middle Ages and modern times, 
comparative languages, Polish, Danish, Russian, Spanish, Italian, 
Turkish, drawing, singing, and gymnastics. 
Candidates who pass the requirements in this qualifying examina- 
tion mst undergo two years of practical training. Six to eight 
probationers are sent to a selected school for one year at a time, so 
that at the end of the period each candidate becomes thoroughly 
fami iar with two schools. During each of the two years regular 
sessions must be «onducted for the study of education by the director 
of the school to which candidates are assigned. At least two hours 
a week must be given to history of education, principles of teaching, 
psychology, and ethics. The probationary period of two years is 
closed by a second examination, the pedagogical examination (Pdda- 
gogische Priifung), conducted by a pedagogical examination board 
(Pddagogisches Priifungsamt), which consists of a provincial school 
councillor, the director, and faculty of the schools in which the 
candidates have been trained. The subjects of the professional 
examination include the history of education and principles of 
teaching. 
It is claimed that the new regulations represent an advance in 
separating the professional from the general examination. The 
regulations are based on the view that a true insight can best be 
obtained into the problems, principles, and philosophy of education 
during the two years of practice. It is objected, however, that an 
intellectual appreciation of the problems involved could be better 
imparted in university courses, and the theory can then be subjected 
to the criticism of practice. The regulations,, since they do not 
require attendance at lectures on education at the university as they 
co in the case of general subjects, depreciate the place of education 
as a science and deal a blow at the development of the subject in the 
universities. The new system, which came into force on April 1, 
1918, involves the danger of reducing education and teaching to the 
level of a handicraft. It is suggested by critics that candidates 
should as a condition of admission to the examination be required to

have attended courses and seminars in education at the universities 
and psychological institutes, that psychology take the place of phil- 
osophy in the general examination, and that in the professional 
examination questions be given in the oral test on the organization, 
history, and psychology of at least one school subject, on moral 
instruction, and on psychological tests and measurements. 
THE NEW SPIRIT IN SCHOOLS. 
The tendencies that are already apparent since the overthrow of 
the monarchical government in Prussia are indicated in a number of 
decrees and circulars that have been issued by the new minister of 
education. Thus the Kélnische Volkszeitung of November 16, 1918, 
printed the following decree: 
1. Wherever the teaching of history and other subjects have been used to 
arouse national hatred it must be discontinued in the future; it must be re- 
placed by an adequate presentation of subjects dealing with natural history. 
All biased and false teachings about the war and its causes are to be avoided. 
2. All books which glorify the war are to be removed from the school libraries. 
8. At no time should the teachers pass adverse or false remarks about the 
causes and consequences of the revolution or the present Government which 
are apt to debase in the eyes of the school youth the achievements of the 
revolution. 
4, School authorities and teachers must avoid in their intercourse with the 
school youth any matter that tends to arouse a counter-revolution (especially 
in the Lowlands), as such action is at the present moment greatly endangered 
by the possibility of a civil war. 
5. Pending the decree about the separation of state and church, the children 
of dissidents and persons holding religious views for whom no provision has 
been made in the present curriculum must be excused from the lessons in re- 
ligion without any further proof, on the request of persons responsible for their 
education. 
This was followed at the close of November by the Socialist pro- 
gram of education issued by the Socialist Kultus-Minister, Herr 
Konrad Hinisch, of which a translation appeared in the Times (Lon- 
don) Educational Supplement, December 19, 1918; 
A. GENERAL. 
1. The separation of church and state has been settled in principle. 2. Re- 
ligion has ceased to be an examination subject, and the introduction of unsec-

clergy and participation of the clergy in the district inspections are abolished. 
4, Mixed education of boys and girls has already been introduced in some 
schools. 5. Teachers and scholars receive powers of self-government. 6. All 
chauvinism is banished from the instruction, and especially from the instruc- 
tion in history. 7. Prussia will propose the assembly of a school conference

the organizations of artists of every school. 32. The royal theaters will become 
national theaters, and the court orchestras will become national orchestras. 
SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. 
The appearance of this program created considerable alarm 
throughout the country among those who feared not only separation 
of the church and school but the elimination of religious instruction. 
In response to numerous telegraphic and letter inquiries Herr Konrad 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
  EDUCATION IN GERMANY. 807 
Hinisch addressed to the Rheinische Zeitung in Cologne the follow- 
ing telegram: : 
Repudiate most vigorously the baseless rumors that the Kultus ministry 
intends immediately and by a mere decree to bring about unawares and with 
a single stroke the separation of church and state. The carrying out of this 
progrum is, to be sure, in line with our policy, and the initial steps are already 
in the course of preparation. But it is to be understood, and the members of 
the ministry are unanimous, that representatives of the church will also be 
invited to the preliminary work which involves financial, judicial, and, in 
gencral, political questions. Preliminary discussions with representative clergy- 
men and instructors of canonical law have already been initiated. Efforts have 
been made to guarantee the interests and spare the feelings of the church 
circles in Prussia. No one will be slurred. Irrespective of all other considera- 
tions, such action would be in opposition to the general political situation. The 
Prussian ministry of education conducts no narrow provincial, but state 
politics. There is no reason for apprehension on the part of the Catholic 
population. 
An official statement of our ministry regarding these questions will be issued 
in the nearest future——[Frankfurter Zeitung, Nov. 26, 1918.] 
Several points seem to stand out as indicating the future develop- 
ment of Prussian education. These are the secularization of the 
schools, the introduction of professional inspection in place of clerical 
supervision, increased participation of the teachers in educational 
administration, and the establishment in some form or other of the 
Einheitsschule. Students who are interested will find it profitable 
to compare the tendencies here outlined with the proposals of the 
teachers laid before the Parliament at Frankfort in 1848,

CONDITIONS PRIOR TO THE WAR. 
The political changes now taking place in Austria-Hungary will 
be followed undoubtedly by far-reaching alterations in the school 
system, whereby old modes will be swept away and new ones in- 
augurated. In the present sketch the attempt is made to treat only 
such problems and movements as are likely to continue in some form 
and thereby maintain a living interest, even under a new political 
administration. Whatever the new political units may be, school 
men will continue to give attention to centralized control of schools 
as against local control, which is the substance of the State public 
school problem that has long occupied the attention of teachers in 
Austria. In regard to school organization, the “ Einheitsschule,” in 
which are involved the opportunities of the great mass of pupils, is 
likely to receive further attention, even under an altered administra- 
tion. In the reorganization of the schools that Austrian teachers 
and statesmen are about to consider, they will try to realize the 
thought that special talent of any kind is a treasure belonging to the 
State, which, for the good of the State, should be brought to its own 
complete fruition. To discover such individual talent and to find 
the means, inside or outside of school, for its development will be 
more fully realized and accepted as a duty of the State, While it 
is premature to attempt a forecast of the character the educational 
movements inaugurated by the present upheaval will assume, it is 
quite certain that they will break the barriers within which the 
schools have hitherto done their work; new duties demanded by actual 
life will come within the scope of ‘the teacher’s labors; new agencies 
from the practical activities will be enlisted in educational work. 
In treating the schools of Austria in their present condition of 
change, it is, of course, disappointing to be unable to follow any 
309 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  310 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, x 
departure or movement to a stage of finality. Perhaps, however, 
there are compensations in observing how the schools and teachers 
have adjusted themselves to the emergencies created by the war and 
have met the crisis; the balance they have been able to maintain; 
the encouragement, advice, and example they have furnished; and 
the pressure of autocratic domination under which they have labored. 
At this moment full details are not at hand, but there are enough to 
show that the teachers in Austria are, as would be expected, better 
prepared than any other class of that country to accept the political 
changes in a spirit of sanity and poise. 
The educational currents created by the war receive their special 
character from the original lack of solidarity among the people of 
Austria-Hungary. The Germanic, Slavonic, and Hungarian Prov- 
inces, each comprising within itself races differing from one another 
in politics, religion, and ethnic origin, have been unable to effect an 
amalgamation of their units. 
They have been only loosely united into one commonwealth held 
together by a governmental machinery which is necessarily cumbrous. 
The two dominant Provinces, Austria and Hungary, have had a 
ruler in common, but little else. The provincial parliaments, 17 in 
number, have been virtually autonomous in determining their inter- 
nal affairs as well as in the ordering of their schools. Members of 
Parliament from the Crown lands have been elected by a constit- 
uency split up by 7 or 8 languages, and by differences in religion, 
tradition, and industry. The qualification best recommending a can- 
didate was the ability to further some provincial interest rather than 
measures of nation-wide scope. In the Imperial Parliament the Aus- 
trian part of the assembly, consisting of Czechs, Poles, Ruthenians, 
and Italians, have been still more divided than the Hungarians. In 
the factional struggles, therefore, the plans of the latter have gener- 
ally prevailed. Each political faction set up unity as its aim, but 
each made itself the center to which the others should be united. 
“The Magyars revolted against being Germanized, but saw no in- 
consistency in insisting that the Serbians, Croats, Rumanians, and 
Slovenes should be Magyarized.” Yet up to the time of the war no 
dismemberment seemed probable, for the Provinces were so related 
that while “they had a hard time to live together, they would have 
a still harder time if they parted company;” hence the struggles 
have been, not for secession, but for the fullest freedom within the 
union. 
The Germans of Vienna are different from their kinsmen of Ber- 
lin. They are not so robust; they are less diligent, less inclined to 
orderliness,’ less commercial, but more cheerful, good natured, and 
genial. Austrian patriotism has always been far more a product of 
/ reasoning than an instinctive attachment to the State. With the 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 811 
Austrian, feeling for the State has never been sufficiently strong to 
supplant the attachment for his native crownland. 
In Germany there was, in 1900, only one case of illiteracy among 
2,000 recruits, while in Austria there were 356. Since then the figures 
have become considerably less. This result should be judged in the 
light of the fact that Germany examines her young men at the time 
of recruiting, while Austria and Hungary at the time of taking the 
census. In Germany three generations have passed since school 
attendance was made obligatory, while in Austria two and in Hun- 
gary only one. 
The incessant conflict among 8, 9, or 10 different races has obscured 
the view in respect to social, cultural, and educational needs, and 
here is at least one cause of the lack of determination vigorously to 
combat the condition of illiteracy that prevails. 
STATE OR LOCAL CONTROL. 
The solution of the problem of State or local control over the pub- 
lic schools will be fundamentally affected by the political changes 
now pending. As a public issue it may, indeed, be obscured for a 
time by the larger one of the reorganization of the State itself, but it 
will reappear as the new administration sees the necessity of uniform 
instruction in the rudiments of citizenship under the new organiza- 
tion. : 
In Austria-Hungary the Ministry of Education exercised supreme 
control over all schools with the exception of certain institutions 
under the management of the Department of Agriculture. The im- 
mediate control was vested in the provincial legislature and carried 
out through (a) a school council for the crownland, (0) a district 
board for each district, and (¢) a local board for each community. 
The legislature selected the members of the crownland councils from 
the clergy, the citizens, and the specialists in education. The same 
authority also ratified the appointed membership of the district and 
local boards, determining the power vested in the several boards and 
the details of arrangements under which they discharged their duties. 
The school programs and schedules were drawn up under the direc- 
tion of the Ministry of Education on the basis of outlines furnished 
by the crownland councils. 
The power of enacting laws for the folk school was apportioned 
between the State and the several Provinces, according to the consti- 
tution of 1867. The power of determining the principles was re- 
served to the State; all other matters, such as founding and main- 
taining schools, insuring attendance, inspection, fixing the legal status 
of teachers in respect to appointment, salaries, retirement, dis- 
cipline—all these matters were left to the legislatures of the crown- 
lands.
-P-A-G-E-312
  312 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
In placing the management of the schools and the responsibility 
for their progress in the hands of local bodies, the lawmakers had in 
mind the example of Switzerland, where a similar distribution of 
control created a healthy competition among school communities. In 
Austria, however, no such rivalry set in. The people did not then 
recognize the intimate dependence of the productive industries on 
the work of the schools; they regarded the outlay for schools as un- 
productive. To this was added dissatisfaction over the unequal dis- 
tribution of the expenses. The appointment of teachers, the regula- 
tion of teachers’ salaries, and the school inspection were left to the 
crownland and the individual districts, with the result of frequent 
complaints of arbitrary action; teachers were appointed, not with 
regard to professional merits, but for reasons that had nothing to do 
with the vocation of teaching, such as political and factional adher- 
ence. 
Now one racial division, now another, placed a prominent. per- 
sonality at the head in the Ministry of Education. The political 
forces that could be mustered would effect a change in the board of 
education and thereby a change in the system. German, Polish, 
Czechish, Magyar leaders, in their efforts to draw a following, pro- 
ceeded on different lines. The school system became unsettled and 
troubled by innumerable regulations issuing from no dominating 
central idea. Desirable reforms were obscured or set aside in order 
to enhance the prestige or power of a faction. If the crownland 
nations are ever to draw together in a closer union, some way of 
imparting instruction in citizenship should be adopted for all the 
schools of the State. Such instruction has indeed been included in 
the programs of schools above the elementary, but there was no con- 
certed effort in the direction of general unity; hence the subject cre- 
ated differences rather than common purposes. Again, the greatest 
latitude was permitted to each school in the mode of imparting the 
instruction, whether as a subject with its place among the other 
subjects, or as an informal discipline to be imparted anywhere within 
the general framework of the curriculum. 
In the efforts toward unity and integrity, one class of institutions 
is brought prominently to the front. Unity among the schools re- 
quires unity among the teachers and the institutions that train them. 
Some power must be wielded from a central point to steady their 
* efforts into cooperative activity. The interests here involved can 
never be of a merely local character and as such can not safely be 
intrusted to local authorities. They are intimately connected with 
the rebuilding of the forces that the war has destroyed and of replen- 
ishing the depleted sources of subsistence. In the House of Repre- 
sentatives the Austrian Minister of Finance gave expression to these 
1Piidagogische Rundschau, February, 1917.  
-P-A-G-E-313
  THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 313 
thoughts, in the discussion of the war budget in September, 1917, 
when he said that expense for measures to improve the people’s 
health and education should be regarded as productive expenditures 
and as such to be furthered by the State. Thereby school questions 
become State questions of the first magnitude. From this it follows 
that schools for the training of teachers are the chief prerequisite for 
extending and improving public education. At present there are 84 
State institutions, as against 64 private—crownland, city, denomina- 
tional, and other—founded for the same purpose. ‘The training of 
the teachers for the State in consistent and coordinated notions of 
duty and service that extend beyond provincial limits is an obliga- 
tion resting on the State itself. This duty the State already exer- 
cised with regard to the middle schools and the universities, but to 
have charge of the entire training of the teachers is in a still higher 
degree the duty of the State.* 
The thought is gaining prominence that the development of the 
entire people, together with national events, such as those now tak- 
ing place, furnish instruction material for a national school, and 
that the elementary and the advanced folk schools should more fully 
utilize this national material. Then, too, the war has shown how 
deep and dangerous were the ruptures that threatened the Austrian 
people. In order to check these disintegrating tendencies the State 
must take direct hold of the folk school and thereby foster the in- 
terests of a firmer union. 
The difficulty in bringing the folk school under direct control of 
the State lies in the fear that the general population would thereby 
be excluded from participating in the management of the schools. 
This fear appears to be unfounded, for while the State would, under 
the change contemplated, exercise direct control without the inter- 
vention of other legislative bodies, it would be in continual confer- 
ence with the crownlands to ascertain the wishes and conditions of 
specific localities. The school district and communes would be re- 
lieved from the burden of expense, regularity of attendance would 
be secured, and the communes be free independently to further edu- 
cation in their respective localities. 
The transfer of folk school management to the State would meet 
squarely the criticism, coming from the crownland school districts, 
that the gymnasia and the universities with their aristocratic patron- 
age are liberally supported by the State, while the schools for the 
people are left unprovided and neglected. By taking these schools 
under its own protection the State would effectively silence such 
criticism. 
The idea of the State folk school has gained currency and favor 
especially in those Provinces that, on account of political dissensions 
  
1 Pidogogisches Jahrbuch, 1918.  
-P-A-G-E-314
  814 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
and financial stringency, have been unable adequately to support 
their schools. But the principle of centralization, which it embodies, 
involves the choice of central authority in which the controlling 
power should be vested. 
Just here Austria felt that her interests were vitally concerned. 
In organizing for the keen industrial competition which the coming 
years will bring, the German language must be the center and rally- 
ing point. It is not enough for the State, therefore, to enact a law 
and leave the realization of its ends to the crownlands. She must 
with a firm hand guide the schools herself, for with respect to the 
schools crownland autonomy has been a disappointment, 
Under more favorable circumstances, defective or inequitable 
laws could be remedied by legislative action. When, however, the 
State passes a general enactment under which relief might be 
sought by communities and school boards, this enactment will be 
construed and interpreted by 17 different legislative bodies. In the 
opinion, therefore, of the foremost educators of Austria, national 
uniformity with equity in its operation can not be secured through 
a State law interpreted and enforced by the crownland legislatures. 
In the State folk school these men see relief from the random expen- 
diture of money and energy which thus far has had the lamentable 
effect of increasing the contentions among Austria’s numerous fac- 
tions, 
THE PROBLEM OF THE EINHEITSSCHULE. 
As in all-civilized countries, the war has brought home to the 
people of Austria the importance of fully utilizing all its resources, 
intellectual as well as material. It has emphasized the relations 
which the public school sustains to industrial life and thereby added 
new interest to the study of better coordination between the country’s 
education and its industries. i: 
Judging from the views reflected in the Pidagogische Rundschau 
and in the Jahrbiicher for 1916-1918, a new impetus has been given 
to the movement for extending all forms of education to the largest 
number in order to help the schools more fully to contribute toward 
industrial needs. Hence there is a stronger insistence on, first, a 
regrouping of studies to meet individual capacities as these appear 
between the ages of 10 and 14 years; second, a more rational guidance 
in vocational selection; and third, an articulation between the ele- 
mentary and the advanced courses that shall permit a pupil to 
pass on to his chosen work without waste of time and without social 
handicap. i 
Readjustments of this kind, to which the stress of recent events 
has given new significance, constitute the outline of what in the 
countries of Europe is known as the problem of the Linheitsschule.
-P-A-G-E-315
  
THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 3815 
More fully stated, it includes everything that affects the organic 
connection between school types, conditions of admission, educa- 
tional aims, and vocational selection. 
Fundamentally the problem arises directly out of the origin and 
growth of different classes of educational institutions. Historically 
the folk schools had an order of development different from that of 
the higher institutions. The higher educational aims were set up by 
the church and the state; and the church and the state founded in- 
stitutions adapted to realize these aims in their advanced character. 
The university grew up within the church, often under the imme- 
diate patronage of some prince, who hoped to secure its power and 
prestige for his principality. Schools of gymnasium rank and scope 
were then established to prepare pupils for the universities, eventually 
becoming the exclusive ports of entrance to these. The authorities of 
all advanced institutions prescribed a special form of dress and con- 
duct of life to be observed by masters and pupils, conveying the idea 
of separateness as well as of corporate rights and privileges. The 
gymnasia again required a certain amount of elementary instruction 
for admission; to meet this requirement special preparatory schools 
(Vorschulen) were founded, which in their status of preparatory 
schools for the gymnasia partook of the exclusiveness of the latter. 
The origin of the public elementary schools may also be credited to 
the church, for some knowledge of reading and writing was neces- 
sary for the church to do its work. But the instruction imparted 
was of a humble order, stressing usefulness, obedience, and religion, 
with no impressive associations. There existed in the early times a 
feeling that the duties of an elementary school teacher could be in- 
trusted to anybody, of even modest personal education. Unfortu- 
nately the terms “school for the poor” and “ charity school” were 
close at hand, and were frequently used to characterize these early 
institutions for the children of the poor. 
Educational leaders eventually saw the importance to the coun- 
try’s prosperity of a more adequate education of the public. The 
public schools then entered on their own mode of growth. School- 
houses and school facilities better adapted to the work were pro- 
vided; institutions for the training of teachers were established; 
then laws requiring attendance; and, finally, school programs and 
courses growing out of the needs of the people. As its scope ex- 
panded the folk school grew into the advanced elementary (Biirger) 
school, the latter type being common to all the Germanic peoples of 
Europe. In the same continuity from the original public school 
appeared the modern school (Realschule), which did work equal 
in advancement to parallel schools of the classical type. 
In such a development of the school system from opposite direc- 
tions each of the two parts came to have definite ends and implica-
-P-A-G-E-316
  
    
  316 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
tions. The gymnasium and the university became the institutions 
which opened the way to the professions and the sciences. But the 
long and arduous road leading to distinctions through university 
studies can be successfully pursued only by the student whose parents. 
have wealth to assist his natural endowments. Again, these institu- 
tions came to be considered as places to prepare for social position 
through the prestige the university confers. 
The folk school, on the other hand, and the institutions which 
grew from it, have been associated with the everyday needs of the 
people. Their educational aims have been more modest. After com- 
pleting the required school period, their pupils were expected to 
return to an occupation like that followed by their parents rather 
than to enter on advanced studies. 
The present sweep of democratic ideas, augmented by the exi- 
gencies of the war, is breaking down the traditional school bounda- 
ries and demanding that each member of the commonwealth be given 
the fullest opportunity to train for the service he is best fitted to 
perform. First of all, this requires that whatever faulty coordina- 
tion or other handicap attends the schools as a result of their mode 
of development be corrected or removed, so that the pupil’s progress 
may be limited only by his own capacity. 
Structurally, it means that the series of school types that have 
developed from the two opposite directions—from the university and 
from the folk school—be brought together into a single organic 
sequence of schools. Practically, it requires the consideration of a 
number of separate problems that arise partly in completing the 
amalgamation and partly from the various social and industrial 
interests thereby affected. Whatever adjustment of this kind the 
schools may be able to make is to that extent a solution of the 
einheitsschule problem. 
The problem is not a new one. Pestalozzi and, in later years, 
Friedrich Paulsen and Kerschensteiner saw the regrettable effects 
of a system that separated pupils into categories on the basis of their 
parents’ means, thereby causing the schools to further social cleav- 
age. The earliest plans to carry out the unity idea—which are 
almost the same to-day—took the form of a common required primary 
period which alone should admit to secondary institutions. The 
early objections were that the plan was impossible of realization,. 
that it was urged in the interest of certain classes of teachers, and 
that it was calculated to advance the interests of political factions. 
Most of these objections came, however, from school men unwilling 
to disturb the existing structure. At this time vocational selection 
had not become a part of the unity idea, or the number of objections. 
would have been still greater. Notwithstanding the opposition, the 
plan gained favor to such an extent that some recognition was.
-P-A-G-E-317
  THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 817 
given to it in the school enactments of several countries. In “ Die 
Einheitsschule” Richard Ballerstaedt traces its development and 
points out that in France a law of 1869 caused the founding of 
State preparatory schools to be discontinued. In 1873 a law was 
passed in Sweden approaching the unity school idea. Norway in 
1869 replaced the preparatory school by a common foundation for 
all advanced schools. The school laws of Denmark, passed in 1903, 
advanced the principle in that country. In the United States it 
has never been a problem, for here the common undivided school has 
always been the basis of the entire system. Though an approach to 
it was made in Austria by laws passed in 1869 and 1883, slow prog- 
ress has been made up to the present time. Now the war has made 
the Einheitsschule idea a living and vital issue. The educational 
press combats the notion that a few only are entitled to enjoy the 
achievements of art and science, and that the many are destined to 
perform the labor through which these achievements are reached. 
Just as every pupil must be admitted on equal terms, setting aside 
the distinctions of wealth or station, so must all kinds of work re- 
quiring trained skill be admitted to the schools on equal terms, free 
from every taint of association. From every consideration, peda- 
gogical and practical, enlightened opinion in Austria demands that 
practical work be brought within the scope of the school activities 
and placed on the same plane as other subjects, whether it is done 
in the workshop, the school garden, or the school kitchen. In so far 
as the process of reorganization may affect the inclusion or exclu- 
sion of subjects, there will be the opportunity to have the prestige 
of labor officially proclaimed by assigning it equality with other stud- 
ies. In urging this step the schoolmen are not clamoring for mere 
monotonous equality. The democratic contention for equal oppor- 
tunity must heed the aristocratic insistence on strictly determining 
the value of an achievement and the superiority of personal worth. 
All plans embodying the unity principle include a common, undi- 
vided, elementary period for all pupils as the first essential, as already 
pointed out, and hence the discontinuance of the preparatory de- 
partments attached to State or municipal secondary schools. The 
basis for this common period is found in the folk school, which in 
Austria usually comprises five ‘years. But the length of time it is 
expedient for the children of a community to attend the same ele- 
mentary school is a matter on which educators are not agreed. Some 
teachers and most parents believe there should be a departure in the 
direction of a chosen calling as early as possible. Postponement of 
the choice by a year beyond what is necessary would, in their opin- 
ion, be a loss. Just here arises the consideration that, in their eager- 
ness to select a specific line of activity, the guardians of pupils 
should not overlook the importance of teaching them the purpose 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  318 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
of work in general, to which their own proficiency must be related. 
There must be the general training for citizenship to give meaning, 
balance, and coordination to the vocational training. 
To carry out the principle gives rise to numerous problems. At 
what stage of a child’s development, for instance, do its powers and 
capacities appear with suflicient clearness to furnish a safe basis 
for the choice of calling? In Norway, where this question has been 
much discussed, teachers vary in their estimates between the ages 
of 9 and 13. Kerschensteiner, of Germany, holds that a child’s apti- 
tudes are seen at the age of 10 or 12, with the exception of memory 
by rote, which appears with marked differences among children much 
earlier. 
The mode of determining a child’s advanced elementary studies 
is fraught with its own perplexities. In most countres of central 
Europe, where a free road is now urged for all gifted pupils and 
special roads for the most gifted, this question has become promi- 
nent. Should the choice be left to the parent and the teachers, who 
would be guided by the gifts and inclinations that have come to light 
during the pupil’s three to seven years in the primary school, or 
should resort be had to special intellectual tests? 
The choice of calling carries with it the responsibility for choice 
of courses consistent therewith. In the Pidagogiches Jahrbuch for 
1918, Prof. Theodore Steiskal contends that it would be advisable 
to have a board consisting of teachers, school physician, and pa- 
rents to determine what courses of study a pupil should take up. 
In the decisions of this board the teacher and, if necessary, the 
faculty should have the deciding vote, with the understanding, how- 
ever, that their conclusions be based both on tests of knowledge and 
on general tests of the pupil’s intelligence and endowments. The 
decision of the parents would be simplified in so far as they would 
choose only among the several school types the one that would best 
meet the gifts of their children, as explained during the conference 
with the advisory board. The full purpose of this advisory board 
would be to protect the intellectual, moral, and physical welfare, 
and, in fact, the future happiness of the children, against the vanity 
of the parents. In view of these purposes, Prof. Steiskal urges the 
employment of tests for scientifically ascertaining a pupil’s fitness 
for a specified department of work and study. Intelligence tests, 
vocational psychology, and school organization would thereby be 
brought together and comprise a field for the solution of the weight- 
jest educational problems of the present time. 
As it would diminish a pupil’s chance for success to be ushered 
into a calling already overcrowded, industrial and professional de-

mands have to be considered in the selection. Statistics showing 
the fields that offer the best openings would have to be compiled for 
the use of the selecting board. Again, the interests of the pupils are 
fully guarded only when the selection of courses may be freely al- 
tered within a reasonable time, as experience may show that the first 
choice was erroneous. The structure of the school units, therefore, 
must provide alternatives and equivalents that can be accepted 
within limits as leading to more than one calling. 
Even though carried out by conscientious advisers, acting under 
the most favorable conditions, the selection of vocations and studies 
for others is not free from objections. Many teachers are reluctant | 
to take these matters out of the hands of the parents in the manner 
indicated. Again, they hesitate about assuming the responsibility 
involved in selecting some pupils for ambitious higher studies and 
assigning others in advance to special tasks of social servitude. 
In respect to organization the principle of the unity school moves 
toward complexity rather than simplicity. It must prepare divergent 
roads for the increased number of student groups formed by voca- 
tional selection, each group moving on toward specialized studies. It 
must provide transition possibilities, so that the pupils may, in case 
of altered choice, pass from one road to another without too great 
loss of time or effort. Again, as circumstances allow some to continue 
at school longer than others, points of conclusion must be providea 
to permit pupils of various means and gifts to finish their periods of 
study at different times, yet with some degree of completeness in each 
case. 
The principles of structure as set forth by Kerschensteiner, Lang, 
and Steiskal give particular prominence to vocational selection, which 
is now associated with the unity idea. As individual capacities ap- 
pear earlier in some children and later in others, the selection can not 
be made so that pupils are classified into categories at a fixed time. 
The earliest grouping should be general and tentative. 
A preliminary inquiry like that for some years conducted by 
M. Belot, of Paris, would be easy to make and cause no derangement 
of the work. He invites each pupil to complete the following form: 
1. When I become a man, I wish to be_-----_------_--_-___. I wish to be

Assuming a period of six years required of all pupils, the first four 
years would undoubtedly suffice for a selection along broad and basic 
lines. Accordingly, some differentiation in the study program would 
come at the end of the fourth year, probably with added language 
study in one group of courses and increasing stress on science in the 
other, Further division would take place at the end of the obliga-

tory period when some would enter the trades as apprentices, while 
others would continue in the advanced elementary school for another 
year; others would enter the continuation schools to pursue studies 
in the direction of technical vocations and industries, while still 
others would continue toward the gymnasium. Further selection, or 
alteration of selection, would come at different times between the 
ages of 12 and 14 as the pupils would complete units of the continua- 
tion work. Again, a selection of advanced technical or university 
studies would be made at 16 or 18 with specialized grouping in the 
direction of the career in view. Details of studies and schedules can 
not be settled until the altered articulations among the school units, 
as required by the plan, are effected. Many teachers of Austria do 
not regard the present as an opportune time to attempt radical re- 
forms. Questions of reorganization involving the interests of peo- 
ple in all stations in life should not be settled under the pressure of 
abnormal influence, yet insistence on reforms comes both from the 
folkschool with the cry of equality of opportunity and from the sec- 
ondary institutions with demands for relief from the adverse condi- 
tions under which they labor. 
As one of the heaviest tasks assigned to the Einheitsschule is to 
remove social barriers, its opponents ask whether this task does not 
belong to society rather than to any one of its institutions. The 
demand for such a schocl is, in reality, an effect of what is evolving 
among social orders. Whether the schools in their practical ar- 
rangements can further this cause is extremely doubtful. Assum- 
ing that all children, those from homes of poverty and those from 
homes of opulence, could be brought together in the same classroom 
and set to work on the same lessons, would they not segregate into 
groups at every recess and every free period, and would they not 
regard the enforced association as a grievance? Children are not 
skilled in concealing notions of superiority fostered in their homes, 
and they can not be expected to exercise the tact and forbearance 
that their parents lack. The social functions connected with exami- 
nations and commencements would be embarrassing to the student 
from a home in poor circumstances. Will not the functions in which 
he takes part cause him more fully to realize the difference in rank, 
and, hence, emphasize the lines of social division? It is further 
pointed out that parents may reasonably be permitted to exercise 
discretion in the choice of schools and hence the association of their 
children. What if rich and superior families refuse to send their 
children to the public schools and reject the common undivided 
period? Again, assuming that obstructions can be removed so that 
a free road to advancement is opened for all, the means of travel 
must also be provided, a matter which thus far has received little 
attention in the discussion of the Einheitsschule. 
 
-P-A-G-E-321

These objections are met by pointing out that the changes in 
question, like all far-reaching changes, can take place only grad- 
ually. Time must be allowed for pupils to accommodate themselves 
to the new adjustments. In the meantime, it is urged, ameliorate 
the conditions both of the public schools and of the pupils in at- 
tendance. Improve the hygienic arrangements; reduce the number 
of pupils in a class, and, above everything else, appoint the best 
teachers at salaries commensurate with their work. The State and 
the community will see that it is to their advantage to discover and 
develop talent, and they will create the funds necessary for this 
purpose. Eventually the best human qualities, the best powers of 
heart and intellect will win and find their just level in these asso- 
ciations. In both its general and practical character the most en- 
lightened school men look upon a system of education as a structure 
continually subject to changing emphasis, and, hence, to constant 
‘ readjustment of its units. It is a living thing, an organism rather 
than a mechanism; it must respond to the shiftings and the changes 
that take place in the society from which it grows. As the directing 
of the schools was transferred from the official power of the church 
to the state and the commune stress was laid on new features of its 
work. Varying phases of school problems, therefore, are accentuated 
as they appear against a social background of different times and 
different countries. 
In Germany the Einheitsschule at first concerned itself with. at- 
tempts to “satisfy divergent educational requirements, especially in 
the domain of secondary education.”? Later the emphasis shifted 
to that of a common undivided elementary period to serve as the 
foundation for* either a classical or modern education.” The Frank- 
furter curriculum preserves the spirit of the unity principle while 
it sets up several distinct aims due to modern needs. More recently 
another phase of the proposed reform is uppermost—every talent 
is a treasure belonging to the nation; the school must find it and open 
an unobstruced way for its fullest development and utilization. In 
Austria, too, educational leaders see the importance of the early dis- 
covery of talent and its fullest development for service; they see the 
waste and disappointment bound to follow an indiscriminate encour- 
agement of the fit and the unfit alike to pursue advanced studies; 
hence they are concerned with plans for checking the influx by means 
of rational selection. As there is danger of erroneous selection, they 
wish divisions of the school work so correlated as not to leave the 
pupil irrevocably committed to a course of education upon which 
he has entered through ill-considered reasons. The unity principle 
to be embodied in the altered organization of the schools must take

into consideration the enlarged scope of their work, and reconcile, 
so far as possible, a number of divergent trends due to present social 
needs. The function of the schools is no longer limited to impart- 
ing instruction; the schools become the centers of welfare work, 
first of all in behalf of the children, and then of entire families; they 
become distributing centers, with activities which are ordinarily only 
remotely connected with teaching. All these endeavors have the 
character of cooperation and collectivism, and carry with them the 
notions of a socialized community and group initiative. To bring 
the schools into organic cooperation with these activities requires 
time and can be done only by gradual alterations of the present sys- 
tem. As moving in best accord with these democratic currents of 
thought, some educators? hold that these reforms should proceed 
from the folk school as an extension of its present scope. By starting 
from the folk school it will be possible to continue the reform not 
only with the least disturbance of the present system but also in 
closest conformity with the needs that arise directly from society. 
The folk-school type would extend into an advanced folk school 
(Biirger Schule), adapted to impart a general education to all pupils 
alike, whether they were destined eventually to become merchants, 
officials, or directors of industry. In the opinion of the same author- 
ity this advanced secondary school could be made the basis of all 
higher schools by organizing it in two divisions: A four-year folk 
school, upon which would be founded a four-year advanced secondary 
school. From the latter division would extend various branches such 
as teachers’ normal schools, military, middle, industrial, agricultural, 
household, and professional schools. Special preparatory courses 
could be given in the Biirger Schule admitting to advanced standing 
in the gymnasium. This arrangement would not encroach upon the 
province of the gymnasium, for the latter would in general be left 
intact and receive its pupils directly from the folk school. An organi- 
zation on this basis would expand, Dr. Wettstein maintains, so that 
a continuation school would be provided for those pupils who leave 
the folk school at the end of the first four years just as an extension 
of the last four years would develop to receive pupils who would not. 
enter the gymnasium. 
The advantages that would follow from this succession and rela- 
tion of units is thus summed up by the same authority : 
The course of general education would be simplified and extended to the 
greatest number. ‘There would be a common period of education up to the 
pupil’s 14th year. A significant gain would be the postponement of the yo- 
cational choice to the more mature age of 14, a time when the pupil’s real 
eapacity rather than general reasons would be the deciding factor. The middle 
schools could be founded with greater independence of local conditions, for 
  
+ Among them Dr. Wettstein.

pupils of maturer years could more easily be away from home. There would 
be an economic gain; for villages and smaller communities, relieved of main- 
taining gymnasia, could open school for a wider patronage. The plan would 
counteract the estrangement among social ranks, as pupils by being educated 
together until the age of 14 would find a greater number of interests in com- 
mon. 
He concludes that the details of schedules and curricula to come 
within this framework of the system can be arrived at only after full 
discussion conducted in the light of the,effects that the present events 
will have upon society. : 
PROBLEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. 
At the universities there has been of late years, according to Dr. 
Richard von Wettstein, a regrettable lowering of the intellectual 
plane of the student body. Among the causes of this is the fact that 
so many people attend the universities who are not naturally fitted 
for a university career. Neither do they possess the means indispen- 
sable to a successful pursuit of advanced studies. Many come to enter 
the universities through the peculiar position that the advanced 
setondary schools (Mittel-schulen) hold in the system. These confer 
the “ one-year privilege ” with reference to military service, and make 
a university career possible. Once started, it is only in exceptional 
cases that students change their direction toward a calling in better 
accord with their aptitudes. Another reason for the lowered stand- 
ards is that in some localities gymnasia are maintained not in re- 
sponse to educational needs but as centers of political influence. 
Once established, every effort is made to increase their attendance; 
accordingly, the requirements are lowered so as to bring the largest 
possible percentage up to the leaving examination and swell the 
numbers that move on to the university. The attendance at the 
middle schools increased from 79,383 in 1893 to 160,000 in 1913. 
Again, the privilege of substituting examinations for studies is 
responsible in part for the undesirable influx. Many girls, after 
completing the courses in the lycée, pursue private studies as prepa- 
ration for the advanced secondary (Realschule) school, and are then 
admitted to the university. While occupied with their university 
studies they pursue extra work leading to the gymnasium finals 
to the neglect of the regular work they have then taken up. They 
and their guardians overlook the fact that attendance at a school 
of the right standing, with its prestige and spirit reinforcing their 
work, is essential to scholarly maturity. No compensation for this 
can be acquired in a few weeks’ residence nor by examinations. 
These and other causes have crowded the universities beyond their 
capacity and entirely out of proportion to the economic demand for

people university trained. In 1898 the total number of students at- 
tending the universities of Austria-Hungary was 16,288; in 1913 
the number had increased to 43,225. The immediate consequence 
was to make the equipment and accommodations inadequate. The 
same lecture rooms had to be used notwithstanding the fact that the 
attendance had trebled. The most unfortunate results of the influx 
are an overflow in all callings requiring academic studies as a pre- 
requisite, and the creation of an academic proletariat. Other serious 
consequences follow, such as a debasing competition for place among 
people of university training in which not always the best but often 
the most insistent wins. 
Qualitatively, too, the education and scholarship of the universi- 
ties suffer from this indiscriminate influx. Even the best students— 
those coming from the gymnasia—show a discouraging lack of inde- 
pendence in intellectual matters1 The gymnasium student “is 
trained to use what he has learned, but he is at a loss when it comes 
to giving an independent judgment.” Too great reliance is placed 
on textbooks and notes, and not enough on efforts to transmute these 
into independent achievements. Dr. Wettstein adds that, while the 
students have an open mind for the practical usefulness of what they 
learn, their opinions are easily swayed, for they depend more on the 
teacher’s word than on their own observations. When the Austrian 
student enters the university he is invested with personal independ- 
ence as a student and as a citizen, assuming also the duties and obli- 
gations that go with these privileges. But those familiar with the 
facts as they come to light see that he is badly prepared for his new 
responsibilities. He is unfamiliar with the ordinary affairs of daily 
life, even with the duties arising from his position in the State and 
the community. Others have hitherto attended to his personal affairs, 
depriving him of the self-government and character training that 
should: go with practical experiences. His inexperience of life is re- 
sponsible, in part at least, for the factional troubles arising when he 
takes part in political and social movements. 
The absence of school-type coordination from the earliest stages 
on has created an unfortunate departmental separateness among both 
students and teachers. At the age of 10 the pupil enters the gymna-’ 
sium, and associates only with those of his own group; the same 
exclusiveness continues throughout his university career. After 
this. continuous education within narrow circles he enters the service 
of State or the community as official, teacher, or physician, in which 
capacity he should be in sympathy with all classes. 
While the university men are confident that some relief from these 
unfavorable conditions would follow from the adoption of the unity 
principle in the school sequence, others are not so sanguine. The

opponents maintain that to institute a type of folk school as the only 
means of entrance to advanced secondary schools, thus sending all 
pupils a considerable distance on the way to the university, would 
augment instead of decrease the influx to these institutions. The 
principle of vocational selection as an essential part of the unity idea 
would not operate toward a diminution of numbers, for it would be 
difficult to carry out with sufficient severity. 
The champions of the unity idea reply that, whether the contem- 
plated change would check the increase or not, growth in attendance 
can not in itself be regarded as an evil or a danger. To extend educa- 
tion in its highest form to all classes of society should be encouraged 
and not checked by arbitrary articulation of school types. Not fewer 
educated people but their more rational distribution according to the 
professional and economic needs of the country is desirable. It is 
true that there were 160,000 students at the gymnasia and schools of 
that rank in 1913-14, but at the advanced commercial schools there 
were only 8,000, at the State vocational schools only 4,800, and at the 
forest academies only 2,000. There is then a real shortage of students 
who prepare for the work in forestry, commerce, trades, and indus- 
tries requiring skilled management and leadership. : 
THE TEACHERS, THE PUPILS, AND THE WAR. 
The enormous losses occasioned by the war in human lives and 
in human means of subsistence, with consequent privations and dis- 
tress, have brought new and urgent questions before the people. 
One of the most vital is how to recover from these losses, and par- 
ticularly how to replenish the depleted food supplies. With the 
statesmen in Austria and Germany these have become school ques- 
tions in so far as it is the schools. that must furnish the training for 
the work of production. Hence educational problems have become 
linked as never before with industrial and political life. The dis- 
covery and utilization of energy and talent came to be regarded as 
service in patriotism. The work of schools, teachers, and pupils 
was mobilized and hence invested with a military glamor. During 
the first year of the war every subject, every activity, and mode of 
instruction was touched by a feeling of exultation that deeply af- 
fected the schools, making it difficult to move in steady courses. The 
immediate effect was to interrupt the instruction by abridged terms. 
As men teachers were called to military service, there came to be a 
shortage of teachers with consequent vacancies often filled by 
women. ; 
The official reports show that the pupils promptly responded to 
appeals to place themselves in the service of the Government for war 
work. They assisted in tilling vegetable gardens for war purposes. 
They collected wood, rubber, metals, herbs, and leaves. They took 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  326 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
part in the Red Cross drives, and in collections for consumptives 
and for wounded and blinded soldiers. The help of the children 
in subscriptions to the third and fourth war loans was especially 
efficient. They caused money withheld from circulation to come 
into use through the State treasury. The self-sacrificing spirit of 
the children was also seen in connection with the “Savings Day” 
instituted in many places. 
Gradually the school work began to resume normal regularity. 
School buildings that had been used for military offices, and sol- 
diers’ recreation rooms, were returned to their former uses. Upon 
the request of teacher’s organizations, barracks vacated by the sol- 
diers were also turned over to the schools to be used as gymnastic - 
rooms, or, when suitably located, as forest and vocation schools. 
The Yahrbuch for 1917 shows that in the third year of the war 
the children labored as before as collectors for useful purposes; they 
helped to plead for the war loans; they tilled the potato gardens, 
and in winter helped to remove the snow.~ The Ministry of War 
issued a formal note of thanks and appreciation in which the chil- 
dren’s services were recognized. They were exhorted to further 
efforts in behalf of their native land, to be self-sacrificing and con- 
stant in their devotion to their country, home, and sovereign. 
But there was then no longer the military glamor and esprit. A 
deep yearning for peace began to be felt among the ranks and 
masses. They began to lament that the Government, although it 
had abandoned its unlimited war aims, had taken no direct measures 
for peace in response to the longings of the people. The privations, 
which became more and more distressing, while the hope of relief 
was still remote, were harder to support with the same fervor of 
patriotism. The school régime had to yield to the necessity of pro- 
tecting the children, so far as possible, against actual suffering from 
want of the necessaries of life. In 1918 about 70,000 children from 
Austria were sent into Hungary, which was better supplied with food. 
To afford the children time to benefit by their stay, the vacation 
was extended till September 18. Later on children from both 
Austria and Hungary were sent to Switzerland, where foodstuffs 
could be more readily obtained. 
An order issued by the Ministry of Education in 1918 permitted 
teachers partially disabled in service to resume their duties in the 
schools. Teachers of the State schools who through no fault of their 
own were unable to resume their work had 10 years added to their 
service record for purposes of computing the pensions, 
The return of teachers to their former duties caused many women 
teachers who had been filling vacancies to lose their employment. 
The protests that arose brought on a general discussion of women’s 
privileges in the profession. The women teachers not only objected
-P-A-G-E-327
  THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 827 
to the abrupt termination of their services, but they pointed out that 
they were excluded from the schools for boys and from the coeduca- 
tional schools and that now efforts were made to exclude them also 
from the girls’ schools. In the course of the discussion, which drifted 
away from the original issue, it was shown that all teachers, men 
and women alike, were at liberty to apply for positions at any 
school and to show that they were eligible. A woman who shows that 
she has the courage and the energy to teach boys should have the 
opportunity; if she proves efficient she should be retained; if not, 
she should be transferred to another position. 
The abnormal prices made it necessary for the teachers to cam- 
paign for an increase in salaries in some proportion to the increased 
prices. To that end teachers’ associations, local and national, drew 
up resolutions laying before the authorities their needs and urging 
an increase. In some cases the censorship weighed heavily on them, 
so that their reports and resolutions were often repressed. It ap- 
pears, however, that the War Department favored the teachers by 
a special indorsement of their petition to the Minister of Education 
(Yahrbuch, 1918). The recognition of the teachers’ services in the 
struggles of the State is apparent throughout. In the autumn of 
1917 the Government made an appropriation of 70,000,000 marks 
available for the living expenses of the 100,000 teachers of the coun- 
try. The conditions for disbursing the appropriation extended it to 
all classes of teachers, whether they are regularly employed, enrolled 
for military service, or substituting for some one on duty at the 
front. This action caused great relief and encouragement; coming 
as it did in December it did something toward dispelling the gloom 
and investing the Christmas season with its old-time cheer. 
‘THE RESPONSIBILTY AND THE SERVICE OF THE SCHOOLS. 
In the early stages of the war the exultation over reported suc- 
cesses of the German-Austrian arms swayed the sentiments and feel- 
ings of all classes, teachers included. They were led to look upon 
their country’s military success as in a large measure the fruition of 
their own work. Not all prominent men stated the case with the 
moderation of Gen. Pliiskow. 
My heart goes out to the teachers of the folk school. In peace they taught 
their pupils the love of their native land and in war they fought as brave men, 
whereby they have elevated the position of their profession. 
The Austrian school journals print.the words of Dr. Hieber and 
Dr. Rudolph Eucken. The former maintains that: 
Our progress in war is due to German technic and industry, German organiza- 
tion and discipline, in fact to the work done by the German schools. To main- 
tain the schools at this point of superiority and efficiency is the best security 
for the future.

Dr. Eucken, whose words are also published with apparent 
indorsement by the journals of Austria, states the case still more 
pointedly : 
First of all, let us constantly bear in mind that the victories of our arms 
are the victories of our schools. For the men whose heroism we admire to-day 
have been trained in our schools and through the faithful work of these have 
become fitted for what they to-day achieve. This should be a hint to us that 
the German school by no means needs an upheaval from without, that it has 
no need of an abrupt break with the past. 
In these connections, though the words of praise were usually ac- 
companied by cautions against the danger of complacency in present 
achievements, the teachers were led to look upon present and pros- 
pective military success as their work. The words of Bismarck and 
others gave ample warrant for identifying the labors of the schools 
with the success of the Army. It will be interesting in the further 
development of the international situation to see whether the teachers 
of Germany and Austria will carry the assumption to its conclusion 
and accept the failure of the imperial armies as the failure of the 
schools of these countries, and, if so, what defects in their work the 
teachers will discover in their analysis of the case. 
In Austria the teachers of German regard the moment as oppor- 
tune to advance the prestige of the German language. The war has 
shown with startling clearness “the damage that a foreign word 
does” and the worth of the native word. The moment has come 
which will determine the prestige and acceptance of the German 
language, not only in Austria and Germany but throughout the 
world. “Our time,” says the Rundschau (May, 1917), “must make 
reparation for sins committed during the past centuries against the 
beauty, purity, and correctness of our mother tongue.” ‘The aim 
of the enemy, which is to crush Germany and thereby our language, 
must ingloriously fail.” “The will to victory over every foreign in- 
trusion (Auslinderei) in our language has, like an elemental force, 
burst into a veritable folk war against all foreign word-mongering.” 
Among the arguments against foreign words are that they make im- 
portant sources of information inaccessible to a great part of the 
German people who intend to pursue scientific or individual studies; 
moreover, that they commit, grievous sins against the highest law 
and purpose of the language, namely, its independence; hence, the 
foreign word should be kept out of the press, commerce, and society. 
All official authorities, such as those of the army and the judiciary 
in State and Province, are in earnest in their efforts to expel foreign 
words from administrative departments. Again, the verbal re- 
sources and the word-creating power of the German tongue are 
pointed out. Counting radicals and derivatives, the Rundschau 
claims 500,000 words for the German language as over against
-P-A-G-E-329

200,000 for the English and 109,000 for the French.t| The war has 
given rise to so many new formations for the use of the army, for 
food and clothing, for commercial and social purposes, that Grimm’s 
word book will soon have to be supplemented by an additional 
volume. 
If the language question involved only a vigorous opposition to 
the intrusion of words from Latin, French, or English sources, it 
would be comparatively simple. The chief contention arises, how- 
ever, from the efforts of the crownlands to make their own lan- 
guages supreme. In these struggles the Hungarians are gaining an 
ascendency over the Germans. The appeal in behalf of the German 
language, though proceeding from patriotic motives, is made em- 
phatic also by the fact of Magyar preeminence. The words of 
Count Tizsa in the Hungarian Parliament illustrate the position 
the German language in some parts of the Empire has been com- 
pelled to take. The count complained that the Germans in Hungary 
were not permitted to educate their children in the German lan- 
guage, and it appears that his words are substantiated by the sta- 
tistical reports from Hungary, giving the population of each district 
and the number of schools each nation has:?

  Aside from the question touching ‘he: status of rival languages, 
the character of courses and textbooks was examined in the light of 
the aims of the struggle. The readers used in the Gzalash folk- 
schools were called in and replaced by others more decidedly Aus- 
trian in patriotism. New matter comprising the most recent mili- 
tary events was incorporated and presented in a way to appeal to 
the young.* j 
The Ministry of Education has ordered that instruction in the 
care of infants shall be given in the middle and the upper classes of

the folkschool. The instruction is to deal with diseases peculiar to 
the early days of an infant, also facts about cleanliness and cloth- 
ing. In the readers several selections are to be devoted to sugges- 
tions on the health and general welfare of young children. These 
subjects are reviewed in the advanced folkschool in more comprehen- 
sive treatment. Still further attention is given to this branch of 
study i in the young folks’ associations, for the purpose of supplement- 
ing and completing the subject. The instruction will asume the form 
ot talks to young people, to girls, and mothers. The teachers of 
Hungary are aware of the new and weighty duties thereby placed 
upon them. The Ministry of Education has offered three prizes of 
4,000, 3,000, and 2,000 crowns, respectively, for the preparation of 
the best textbook on the subject. 
The war, according to published reports, has relieved the State 
of sectarianism in the instruction. The educational journals an- 
nounced with gratification that when the country called there were 
no dogmatic conflicts in religion. The Lutherans, the Catholics, the 
Jews, and the Mohammedans sang the same hymns in the trenches. 
Members of the same denomination may have had grievances against 
one another, but all defended the dearest blessings of their State in 
loyal fellowship. Regarding instruction in religion in the schools, 
the view early gained acceptance that the truth or correctness of 
this or that creed as over against some other should not be touched; 
that instruction in religion has an educational value as a key to un- 
derstanding the past; and that the universal element in religion— 
its power to steady, comfort, and sustain—should enter into the 
instruction and into life without embodiment in denominational 
formulas. 
The war has given a new direction to the sweep of educational 
currents. Instead of studying the remote past as a key to under- 
standing the world of to-day, attention is directed to the present, 
the development of one’s own nation, the spiritual achievements of 
one’s own State. In these sources the schools should be able to find 
instruction material of more direct application to the living present. 
How to realize aims of this kind has received the earnest attention 
of the teachers of Austria. The association, “ Freie Schule,” regards 
the present as the time for the agitation for a modern school. The 
reorganization of the schools was continually discussed so far as the 
censorship did not interfere. It opposed all attempts to compel 
children of nonsectarian parents to attend instruction in religion ; 
it favored plans to make the attendance at the middle schools easier 
for children of poor parents. The association, Lehrerakademie in 
Graz, conducted lectures and discussions to dey elop principles along 
which modern educational laws should be enacted. Laymen have. 
taken part in these activities. The deliberations have been charac-  
-P-A-G-E-331

terized by the absence of scholastic remoteness. That forward- 
looking efforts have been dominant is indicated by such topics as 
“The gates to the future,” “What large problems confront the 
schools and education?” With the view of attaining results to their 
resolutions, the teachers have memorialized the Ministry of Educa- 
tion.? 
Gradually a borderland between the schools and the industries 
has been discovered, a domain that promises to be the scene of the 
country’s most hopeful endeavors. But as emphasized by Prof. 
Victor Fadrus in a lecture, December 1, 1917, without folk school 
teachers of large outlook and endowments nothing can be accom- 
plished. To do their work these men must step forth from their 
seclusion and take an active part in scientific, industrial, juridical, 
technical, political, and art problems of everyday life. The tenor 
of the lecture, which appears to express the view gaining acceptance, 
indicates that the teacher should bring together the people and the 
sciences, the teachers and the arts; to that end the teachers must, on 
the one hand, be in touch with creative men and women of their 
times and, on the other, with the masses that apperceive and follow. 
Practically, teachers at all stages should be able to recast and to 
refashion instruction values so that these may be apprehended by the 
naive perceptive powers of the young. They should clarify the 
laws of achievement; financial resources, for instance, employed in 
united and cooperative combinations can achieve vastly bigger things 
than can the same resources as scattered units. Teachers should be 
prepared to point out what a given community needs, what it further 
would like to have, and also what it may have above its needs. 
The teacher must, over and above the educational requirements, be 
informed on the resources and the economic arrangements of the 
country. These demands have already taken form in the growing 
vogue of home locality study (Heimatkunde). Again, while the 
teacher is an intermediary between the,world and the children, he 
is at the same time an intermediary between the people and their 
aims, between the present and the future. He must share with the 
parents the responsibility for the future of their children; he must 
help to formulate the problems of the community and the nation 
and assist in solving them instead of leaving their solution to self- 
appointed party disputants. 
CONSOLIDATION OF TEACHERS’ UNIONS. 
The success of the armies of central Europe in the early years of 
the war gave vogue to the dream of Middle Europe (Mitteleuropa). 
The “ Schulgeschichte ” covering the time from July 15, 1915, to July 
15, 1916 (Jahrbuch, 1916), shows that the teachers anticipated the   
1 Piidagogisches Jahrbuch, 1916.
-P-A-G-E-332
  
332 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
educational problems that would arise from this union of empires. 
The reports from many teachers’ associations in Austria and Ger- 
many indicate that the teachers welcomed the idea, and that they, 
within the scope of their work, tried to hasten its consummation. 
Their efforts became directed toward uniting the teachers of the 
countries to comprise the new federation. On the 4th and 5th days 
of March, 1916, negotiations were opened between the German 
Teachers’ Association and the German-Austrian Union, looking 
toward a unification of the teachers’ associations of the future Mittel- 
europa. Propositions were drafted and a decision taken to complete 
the federation in the early future. It was further unanimously de- 
cided to have committees appointed from all teachers’ associations of 
the middle-European peoples for the purpose of furthering public 
education and more firmly to cement the fellow-feeling among the 
teachers of these countries. The executive committee of the German 
Teachers’ Association, which in December, 1915, had started the 
movement, was charged with the task of carrying the resolution into 
effect.1 The initiative taken by the German association was favor- 
ably viewed by their colleagues in Austria,who regarded the movement. 
as opportune for affiliations of the kind contemplated. The idea of 
solidarity and union became general. The problem of Mitteleuropa 
and reorganization after the war was eagerly discussed in the asso- 
ciations of Austria. The provincial associations, however, found 
difficulty in reaching a working basis of unanimity. Efforts were 
made to unite the associations of all the crownlands into one union 
without regard to party lines or denominational adherence. (Rund- 
schau, August, 1918.) The folk school teachers of Germany resolved 
on cooperating with those of Austria-Hungary; there was even some 
talk of organic union with those of Bulgaria and Turkey. The 
teachers pointed out that it was desirable to learn more about fellow 
teachers in the allied countries and thereby reach a better under- 
standing of the professional interests they had in common. 
The teachers of Germany sent 40,000 marks to the teachers of 
Austria to help relieve the distress created among their families by 
the invasion of the Russians. This sum was used to assist fugitives 
and other destitute persons for whom no other funds were available. 
This act of good will was to be an enduring monument to the mutu- 
ality of good feeling between the teachers of the two countries. The 
officers of the teachers’ associations were charged with the disposi- 
tion of the sum. “In the war,” says a journal for April, 1916, “we 
have lost much of our unfeeling selectiveness; the struggle between 
classes has been replaced by common interests; former enemies have

  THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 333 
become confederated heroes; nations are extending their hands in 
friendship to one another.” 
As the movement toward consolidating the teachers’ unions of 
these nations was inseparably connected with the war, it rose and 
came to naught with the successes and reverses of the Teutonic 
armies. 
THE NEW ORDER. 
The new order starts with the dismemberment of the Austro- 
Hungarian Empire, from which eventually new Commonwealths will 
arise. Confronted by the impending disruption, each nation is mak- 
ing an effort to maintain its identity and to consolidate with itself 
assimilable portions of other nations. To that.end the Czechs, Jugo- 
Slavs, and Polish leaders have reaffirmed their nationalistic pro- 
grams in uncompromising terms and have denied the Austro- 
Hungarian Government the right to speak in the name of any save 
the Germans and Magyars." 
During this period of uncertainty, of dissolution and of reorgan- 
ization, the teachers have been, so far as it is possible to observe their 
status, swayed by conflicting sentiments. At this moment of disil- 
lusion, so we are told in a journal of October, 1918, the Austrian 
teachers are awaiting the coming reorganization with equanimity. 
They are aware that the growth of national feeling and national con- 
sciousness is so vigorous among the separate Provinces that it is hope- 
less to try to consolidate them into one Imperial Commonwealth. 
The teachers find comfort and compensation in the prospect of relief 
from racial dissensions in new States where each State gets its own. 
The internal struggles have been weighing heavily upon the schools, 
making the enactments of suitable and progressive laws impossible, 
and paralyzing the power to advance. Political considerations have 
swayed and wrenched the school regulations from their just Province. 
“With every change of ministry—and such change was frequent in 
Austria—came a new system. The German, Polish, Czechish, etc., 
ministers of education did not pipe thesametunes.” * * * Hence 
a definite national trend could not be maintained. 
The teachers and others appear to look forward to the new era as 
a time when further social progress shall be made through improved 
opportunities for all. The line of demarcation between wealth and 
intellectual work on the one hand and manual work on the other had 
of recent years come to be more sharply drawn than a decade ago. 
The same authority (Rundshau, Jan., 1918), says that the wealthy 
and the educated were moving farther away from those who work 
with the hands. They no longer touched elbows in social affairs; 
they had no celebrations in common; they did not intermarry.

The distance between a factory owner and his workmen was greater 
than that between the nobility and the plebeians during the seven- 
teenth century or between master and servant during the Mid- 
dle Ages. Should the war, which has exposed so many defects, 
also find a means to bring social classes into closer sympathy with 
one another? 
The teachers also hope the upheaval may bring relief from inner 
dissensions, from bad school laws and obstructive social traditions. 
They view prospective changes without regret, apparently looking 
forward to better conditions under the republican forms of govern- 
ment that may be established. “How republics may prosper is 
shown by the examples of Switzerland and the United States of 
America, which we have before our eyes,” and where “the will of 
the people and the sentiments of the people prevail.” 
PROBLEMS AND IDEALS NOW UNDER DISCUSSION. 
Rapidly moving political changes have imparted a new momentum 
to school reforms, which are ordinarily slow in taking shape. The 
rising administrations are aware that their principles can gain per- 
manence only through the schools. In the new democracies it is 
more obvious than in the older monarchies that policies must reach 
the people and become accepted by them through the schools. 
A few of the current problems and movements which are either in 
sight or already under way as peace is restored are here given. Their 
outcome will depend on the complexion of the political party that 
comes into power. 
First, the country and its leaders hope to find in the closer coopera- 
tion between the schools and the industries the way to recovery from 
the appalling devastation caused by the war. The safety of the 
State and the ascendancy of the schools depend, in the first place, on 
technical efficiency in production and on equitable distribution. 
With this in view, laws expanding the continuation work of the 
schools and the industrial training are urged by the school men. 
The feeling has long been uppermost that much excellent talent 
goes to waste for want of opportunity and encouragement. Hence 
the demand has arisen that its discovery and development should 
not be left to chance, but that the schools in their work shall effect 
an arrangement adapted to bring special gifts into sight during the 
period of the folk school, and that funds be provided to afford such 
gifts the opportunity for full development. 
Then, too, it is felt that the teacher’s duties to the pupils do not end 
with the completion of the courses. The teacher’s counsel and guid- 
ance should be extended to them while they are being established in 
the trades or in business.

THE SCHOOLS OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. 835 
The teachers’ field of labor is being extended into new provinces 
that the war has discovered. They will have a larger share than 
formerly in the responsibility for the health of their pupils. In- 
fancy and childhood are the periods when physical defects threaten- 
ing to become permanent afflictions should be discovered and dealt 
with by the specialist. The teachers will be charged with the duty 
of seeing that this is done. 
That the family is the center from which all educational work 
must proceed is gaining recognition. This conception is leading to 
endeavors to protect the children and their mothers, to look after 
the homes, to see that necessaries and reasonable comforts are pro- 
vided. It is also seen that children need protection against the bad 
influences of the crowded cities and sometimes even against the ar- 
rangements! made by parents who are not morally fitted to take care 
of them. 
The moral welfare of pupils is a cause of much concern to the 
schools and the authorities, hence the demand is set up that the pro- 
tection and care they get shall be better regulated and placed on a 
more comprehensive basis than hitherto and that funds be procured 
for the erection of schools, homes, gardens, playgrounds, training 
schools for defectives, and places of refuge for neglected or way- 
ward children. These educational and welfare institutions are to 
be administered by teachers and physicians rather than by the 
judicial authorities. Among these measures there is a proposition 
to assign the surveillance of each street and the children and youth 
there to one or two reliable persons. Sensational or inciting papers, 
illustrations, and pictures are to be kept from the hands of children. 
Posters of this character are to be kept out of show windows; chil- 
dren’s attendance at motion-picture entertainments is to be strictly 
regulated. 
The increased scope of woman’s work will demand adaptation of 
the schools to better and more consistent plans for the training of 
women in household work and domestic duties, the care of infants 
and the sick. The schools will also be expected to provide better 
physical training for girls. Some training or guidance of value to 
girls as social members of the community will be imparted. 
Physical training must be continued through the entire period of 
schooling, beginning in the earliest days of infancy and adapting 
itself to the changing needs of childhood and youth. Upon leaving 
school the young men should continue the work in the preparatory 
military schools and the young women unite into voluntary associ- 
ation for continued physical exercise, a requisite also to be set up 
for the young men who have completed their military service. These 
endeavors have, first of all, the obvious value of improving health 
and strength, but they have also the very important value of bringing 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  336 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
together persons from all classes for purposes that tend to unite them 
in closer fellow feeling. 
In regard to school control, a general sentiment prevails that State 
control of the folk schools would obviate many of the difficulties 
under which they now labor, particularly the ever-present tendency 
to disruption due to partisan conflict. The salaries of teachers would, 
under State administration, be more equitable. This topic, as well 
as that of the Einheitsschule, involves the organization of the entire 
system. 
The educational associations of Austria urge that the institutions 
for the training of teachers should also be taken over by the State, 
and that, as a consequence, private teachers’ colleges and seminaries 
should be gradually discontinued. They set up further the aim of 
extending the course for teachers from four to five years. To have 
attained the age of 15 should be the only entrance condition. But as 
teachers’ training schools continue from the folk school (Biirger- 
schule), and as these dismiss their pupils at the age of 14, it might 
be advisable, in order to avoid the omission of a year, to extend the 
teachers’ course to six years and consequently admit pupils at the 
age of 14. Entrance examinations should be omitted; the certificate 
from the Biirgerschule should suffice, perhaps on the condition that 
a pupil may be found insufficiently prepared before the end of the 
first semester. The curriculum for teachers should comprise, besides 
the native tongue, one modern language, with the privilege of select- 
ing also a second modern language and Latin. The Society for the 
Education of Teachers regards the inclusion of Latin as essential in 
the course for teachers, maintaining that: 
(a) “Of all Ianguages, Latin is best adapted to support the in- 
struction in the mother tongue.” 
(6) They cite the words of Dr. Rudolph Heinrich, a prominent 
educator of Vienna: 
We have gone to school to the ancients for a thousand years, a fact which 
has charged our modern spiritual life with the conceptions of the ancients, 
which we can not fully comprehend without tracing them back to their sources. 
Most sciences owe their terminology to the ancient languages. The fundamental 
educational sciences, as psychology, logic, ethics, in their basic ideas, point back 
to the intellectual work of the ancients. It is further pointed out that the 
inherent exactness and consistency of the Latin tongue have a powerful forma- 
tive value in education. In Roman history we can study the rise, the spirit, 
and the decline of a world power and observe what makes a people great and 
what is the cause of its downfall. 
As the present sketch is being completed reports from the schools 
of Austria-Hungary come to hand, indicating the sweeping changes 
that may follow in the wake of the present upheaval. 
The present Government of Hungary, according to La Vie Univer- 
sitaire, contemplates bridging the chasm between social orders by re-

quiring students of the learned professions to devote certain hours a 
week to a trade or to strictly manual work. 
The Berne correspondent of the London Times Educational Sup- 
plement for April 17, 1919, telegraphs: 
The Budapest schools reopened last Friday. The Soviet government is pre- 
paring a complete revision of the educational system in accordance with the 
new spizit and aspirations of the world proletariat. The teachers are to begin 
by an explanation of the ordinance of the new government. The schemes of 
instruction in history and citizenship are to be revolutionized by the substitu- 
tion of Marxian teaching for capitalist doctrines of socal economies. Ethies will 
be substituted for religious instruction. The teaching of jurisprudence for 
advanced students in the commercial colleges will be abolished, as the system 
of laws under the communist government is entirely different from that of the 
capitalist régime. 
But such enactments are likely to move back from the extremes till 
they reach a balance in true accord with the new order. The recent 
school laws of Germany, which eliminated religious instruction from 
the curricula, are already in danger of repeal under the protests 
coming from school associations in all parts of the country. In 
Austria-Hungary, as in Germany, the schools need an influence to 
steady them in their labors, some element of permanence that factions 
may feel they have in common. While the stress has been on the 
necessaries of life—hence productiveness, industry, commerce—the 
coming days will find equal stress laid on ideals, for without them 
chaos will prevail. The highest educational aims of the future will 
be sought in human mutuality, truth, self-determination, in which 
educational, social, and philosophic endeavors will make common 
cause. Duties to one’s fellow mortals must be taught; and from what- 
ever source the teaching comes, it can not be made conclusive or 
effective merely as a legal formula. The. State will need—and the 
schools must help to furnish them—ideas of permanence to polarize 
the present flux of feeling and sentiment. The State needs and the 
schools must help to train characters of integrity, of love for justice, 
of irrepressible energy, of comprehensive organizing power, in order 
to give stability to the new commonwealths.

  CHAPTER VII. 
SWITZERLAND. 
® 5 By Prrer H. Prarson, 
Division of Foreign Educational System, Bureau of Education, 
GENERAL CONDITIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS, 
Switzerland has an area of only a little over 15,900 square miles, a 
population of about three and one-half millions, but 25 distinct politi- 
cal units—Cantons—each virtually autonomous in the control of its 
schools. There is no Federal educational board to issue plans, de- 
crees, letters, or special instruction tending to unify the system. 
Under this freedom of development the schools have assumed their 
character in accordance with the language, religion, race, industries, 
and historical traditions that prevail in the several Cantons. The 
resulting variety in organization and methods makes it impossible to 
give a general account of the schools equally applicable to all parts 
of the gountry; hence, features that may be regarded as fairly typical 
will be sketched from reports coming from specific localities, as Bern, 
Basel, or Ziirich. 
The Federal regulations that the Cantons have in common provide 
for obligatory attendance, free tuition, and, to some extent, free in- 
struction material during a period designated by each Canton, op- 
tional attendance at instruction in religion, participation in required 
gymnastics, uniform entrance examination for students of medicine. 
The Federal Union also contributes to the support of all primary 
schools; it prohibits the employment of children of school age in the 
factories; and, finally, it imposes a uniform educational test on the 
recruits that each year enroll for service. 
The annual recruit examinations have a decided educational sig- 
nificance. On a fixed day of the year, after the young man reaches 
his nineteenth birthday, he is required to report to the office of his 
home Canton, where he is examined by a board of health, a board 
on gymnastics and physicial training, and an educational board. 
In gymnastics the examination consists of lifting, running, and jump- 
ing. In reading the requirement is correct enunciation and emphasis, 
with satisfactory reproduction of a selection as regards content; 
in composition a theme is required, correct, or almost so, in arrange- 
ment and details of form; in arithmetic the four elements, with 
integral numbers and fractions, the metric system, proportion, per- 
339
-P-A-G-E-340
    340 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18. 
centage, and interest, are included; the test comprises also the 
history, geography, and constitution of Switzerland. The outcome 
of this examination will determine whether the man is to be accepted 
for immediate service in a military unit or whether he is to be 
assigned for special service, including attendance at a school, to 
remedy the inadequacies revealed in the examination. The final 
result is published by the statistical bureau automatitally assigninf® 
to each Canton the rank held by its schools, with ~ consequent sug- 
gestion for competitive endeavor. 
Though it has been objected that the procedure is not a satisfactory 
touchstone whereby to ascertain the comparative standing of the 
Cantons, for communal ambition may be tempted to establish circum- 
scribed courses narrowly adapted with a view to the tests, yet some 
positive advantages are undeniable. It brings all young men together 
on the same plane of personal worth and human equality, disregard- 
ing the distinctions by which they had become segregated—shop- 
keeper and assistant, teacher and pupil, minister and layman, capital- 
ist and peasant. Again, each commune has thereby been spurred on 
to see that its compulsory attendance laws were strictly enforced, and 
also that voluntary as well as obligatory continuation schools were 
established. The examinations are, moreover, conducted under cir- 
> cumstances adapted strongly to impress each young man with the 
sense of personal responsibility. To acquit himself well intellectually 
at the time he enrolls under the colors and takes the oath of service 
is in itself a distinction; to fail and to be placed under instruction for 
delinquents is here closely connected with failure in duty to one’s 
country. 
In regard to the diversity among the schools, it is apparent mainly 
in the outer form and organization. The obligatory period varies 
between six and eight years, but Cantons with the shorter period have 
generally a form of compensation in obligatory continuation schools 
of from two to three years. The latter, again, differ with respect to 
courses given and the general trend of their work. In some communes 
they supplement the instruction of the folkschools by carrying the 
subjects of these to fuller completion; in others, new subjects are taken 
up with the purpose of preparing pupils for the trades. Even within 
the same Canton local individuality asserts itself by departure from 
the cantonal type program. For example, an hour-and-subject 
schedule was adopted in Ziirich in 1912 to continue in force seven 
years, but some communes in the Canton adopted different schedules 
which were supposed to be in closer accord with their own civic needs 
and with the psychology of their pupils. The hours of the day and 
the free afternoons—generally two each week—and also the vacation 
periods were variously distributed. This departure from the official
-P-A-G-E-341
SWITZERLAND. 341 
type, accepting the official program as suggestive rather than pre- 
seriptive, is a distinctive mark of the progressive trend throughout 
the country. 
The age of admission and the length of term fixed for the infant 
schools differ considerably, the German: Cantons receiving children 
at a later age than the French. The period comprised in the primary 
school varies a good deal, ranging from six to nine years; the period 
of the higher grade schools (Secundarschulen) varies from two to 
five years. In consequence these continue from the fourth, fifth, or 
sixth year of the primary. The concluding years of the latter run 
parallel with the beginning years of the former, giving rise to a 
duplication which, as in Basel, it is attempted to obviate by consoli- 
dating the two into one school unit. The communes exercise great 
freedom in deciding how the preparatory work shall be done, how 
to supplement the work of the folkschool, whether by schools con- 
tinuing in trades and specialties or by those straight in the line of 
progress toward the gymnasium and the university. 
The middle schools comprise a number of institutions variously 
named as gymnasia, colleges, teachers’ training schools, girls’ high 
schools, technical schools, agricultural schools. They do not fix any 
one year as the time of conjunction with the higher grade schools. 
The one characteristic they have-in common is that they prepare 
their pupils for the university and hence usually retain them until 
the time for admission, i. e., to the age of 18 or 19. An instance of 
their diversity is seen in the gymnasium at Basel, which has an eight- - 
year course, receiving pupils at the age of 10 and permitting them to 
enter directly from the primary, without attendance at a higher 
grade school. At Berne the course is eight and one-half years; at 
Ziirich pupils enter at the age of 12 and continue for six and one- 
half years; the technical school at Ziirich has a course of four and 
one-half years, receiving pupils at 14 or 15 and continuing from the 
second or third year of the higher-grade school. 
The flexibility in the scheme of articulation between school types 
of different degrees of advancement is due to the fact that the schools 
articulate from the bottom up. The local needs of separate cantons, 
with diverse industries and educational aims, have given rise to 
schools varying in aims and length of periods, and with these the 
advanced institutions make such connection as they can. 
Closely concerned with this interrelation is the problem of the 
uniform school (Einheitschule), which here has a significance dif- 
ferent from that of other countries. Like those in most other coun- 
tries of Europe, the Swiss educators recognize the importance of 
adjusting the general school plans so as to avoid divisions due to 
14From Special Report to the Ecclesiastical and Educational Department of Norway,
-P-A-G-E-342
  342 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18. 
social cleavage, but they also call attention to other factors of the 
uniform school which in the general discussion are often obscured. 
Two conditions inthe life of a child, both complicated by the social 
status of its parents, call for adaptation of the general school plans: 
(1) The demand which requires a definite course of training for a 
chosen calling—commercial, trade, industrial, or professional; (2) 
the selection of a calling according to the child’s endowments. The 
Swiss believe that the child’s endowments should first be ascertained 
and then its calling chosen, but in the deliberations among European 
educators the latter consideration mainly has been heeded. In deal- 
ing with the social aspects of the problem the political advancement 
of the country helps to eliminate such handicap as may depend upon 
the status of a pupil in society. 
Even a cursory view of the school system reveals a close interac- 
tion between the schools and society. Society has demanded that 
every individual be given the amplest opportunity; that the schools 
encourage individual initiative, that they teach cooperative effort, 
that they deal with the industries, and, in general, that they show 
how each individual pupil can be fitted for the best service. How 
the schools have responded can be seen in what Switzerland has 
achieved. 
PRACTICAL TREND OF THE SCHOOL WORK. 
Touching the welfare of pupils, communal endeavor in Switzer- 
_ land has created means for taking care of their health from earliest 
infancy, for seeing to it that they have the proper nourishment and 
clothing, for founding institutions adapted to the needs of pupils 
specially endowed or specially hampered. Again, this country has 
‘put into legislative form advanced ideas of a social and political 
character, like federal ownership of railways, socialized control of 
city improvements, banks, and industries, and, most significant of all, 
a constitutional proviso that Government enactments shall be referred 
to the voters for adoption or rejection. Aside from the contributions 
of these measures to the happiness and sterling character of the peo- 
ple, certain material ones more easily measurable may be mentioned. 
It appears to be a fact that: 
Switzerland, with no harbors, no coal, no iron, no copper, with high wages 
for manual labor, with agriculture inadequate to home needs, has succeeded in 
becoming, per capita, the next most industrialized nation of Europe, surpassing 
both England and Germany.’ 
_ Inattempting to indicate at least a part of the share the schools have 
in the intellectual as well as material advancement of Switzerland, it 
appears that teachers have spontaneously put into practice the ancient 
maxim, “ We study not for the schools, but for life,” and that they

-P-A-G-E-343
  SWITZERLAND. 343 
are impressed with the importance of adapting their work to life ‘con- 
ditions. When the health or the future of their pupils so demands, 
they have been able to move beyond the régime of books, lessons, and. 
traditional programs and to guide their pupils in such other activi- 
ties as are more closely concerned with their welfare. They are 
aware that the years of a child’s plasticity is the time to discover 
and to insist on remedial treatment of such physical or psychical 
defects as may adhere to it from birth, and they appear conscien- 
tiously to include this among their duties. 
The general system of the schools exemplifies the principle that 
education is a gradual process, with imperceptible beginnings and 
without abrupt finality. The service, therefore, that the school ren- 
ders upon the first admission of a child is not of an instructional 
character; it assumes this character only after a transition period 
usually taken up by the child’s own self-imposed activities. The 
nursery school takes care of the child, first of all, as assistance to a 
crowded home ‘or a home in the distress of poverty, permitting the 
mother, who is probably a wage earner, to leave her child in safe 
hands while she is at work during the day. When a child is pre- 
sented for admission a thorough medical examination is made, and 
if treatment is required it is given. 
Among the institutions for the care of young children, the créche, 
which is nearly always private, receives children of almost any age 
up to 3 years, at which time they may enter the infant school. The 
infant school has two divisions, namely, from 24 years of age to 6, 
and from 6 to 7, the latter division preparing them to enter the 
primary school. From the first the child finds himself in a con- 
genial environment in the school garden with its play equipment; 
there is no restraint as to regularity of hours, nothing giving rise 
to the feeling that in the interest of the school the young pupil is 
cut off for a certain time from home and parents. When the in- 
structional stage is reached, there are kindly teachers to take him 
in hand, to see that he learns the correct pronunciation of words and 
that he acquires good personal habits. So far as expedient the child 
is left to himself in his first efforts to think, to observe, to understand, 
and to judge; he is permitted to drift into school tasks without the 
notion of compulsion; hence he does not come to feel that he is con- 
trolled by a rigorous taskmaster. 
The first form of instruction assumes the nature of entertaining 
stories with talks of a practical tinge that furnish. whatever nucleus 
there is in the early teaching. The opportunity for advancement is 
preserved in the recurrent periods of promotion, usually at the end 
of the year, though in case of the pupil’s sickness they may come at the 
close of the first semester following the year in which the promotion 
would naturally have occurred.

This class of schools shows a tendency to increasing use of Froebe- 
lian methods. The original idea of assistance to the home and of a 
place of refuge offering a favorable environment is retained without 
any modification. To their success it is essential that unselfish people 
be placed in charge, who may anticipate the needs of the children 
and keep in close touch with their homes. 
Just as the system permits the infant gradually to enter the in- 
struction stages of the schools, it permits the young man or woman 
gradually to enter on the duties of a vocation while still remaining 
under the guidance of the schools. This principle is realized in most 
Cantons by the obligatory continuation schools. These are founded 
by the communes and by them brought to an accepted standard with 
regard to buildings and equipment in order to receive State aid. 
They are of two classes, schools for reviewing and supplementing the 
general school branches and schools mainly for training in the voca- 
tions and the trades. 
In most Cantons the compulsory attendance for boys ceases with 
the completion of the fifteenth year, though in others, like Obwalden 
and Wallis, it is from 6 to 12 months longer; yet even these have a 
proviso permitting boys to discontinue at 15 by passing a special 
examination. In certain localities there is an obligatory continuation 
school of two or three years for girls, where instruction is given in _ 
manual work for girls and in household economy. 
In most continuation schools is embodied an idea of the Grundtvig 
institutions of Denmark, namely, that of an intermission after the 
compulsory period by which time is provided for the pupil to recover 
from a species of classroom fatigue by which he is then handi- 
capped; a year or two is permitted to lapse before the continuation ; 
the pupil then takes up the work not only with better vigor, but with 
clearer conception of educational aims. 
The brevity of time in the programs of these schools does not per- 
mit comprehensive curricula nor exhaustive study of any of the 
branches. Hence, only the subjects pertaining to practical and civic 
life are taken up. As a rule these schools admit only young men, 
though in some Cantons, as in those of Ziirich and Bern, they are 
coeducational. As nearly all lead to such practical vocations and 
industries as pertain to the localities in which they are established, 
they show a strong tendency to specialize in the direction of the trades, 
in agriculture, horticulture, or commerce. In the Cantons of Fri- 
bourg and Thurgau there are household schools for girls; in the 
former the required attendance is two years, which may be extended 
to three years if the pupils’ progress has not been satisfactory.+ 
The continuation schools specializing in the vocations and the trades 
are often conducted in accordance with a schedule that permits the   
1 Substance from the Report of Prof. Neuberth. 
SS
-P-A-G-E-345
  SWITZERLAND. 3845 
pupil to be both wage earner and pupil at the same time. The school- 
room and the workshop function in close cooperation. To be properly 
matriculated the pupil must have secured regular employment in the 
trade which he makes his chief study. The employer is closely iden- 
tified with the school; he not only instructs the pupil, but he also looks 
after his interest as wage earner; he has a definite understanding 
with the school authorities about the courses and the time the appren- 
tice pupil may reasonably spend at school. The time the pupil is to 
remain at the work he has begun, together with other particulars 
calculated to insure his attendance to duty, are embodied in a con- 
tract which the pupil is required to sign. The session is held almost 
exclusively in the winter, with from 6 to 12 hours so grouped as to 
fall upon two or three forenoons each week. The flexibility of the 
general system adapts itself to varying local conditions, and the 
instruction ofteri extends throughout the year. The schools thus spe- 
cialize in individual directions so that they fall into groups, each of 
which is characterized by the needs of its general patronage. It 
would be a mistake to suppose that the dominant endeavor is to impart 
peculiar technical skill merely to fit the pupil to be an acceptable 
wageearner. Ethical and humanitarian subjects are always included, 
to ennoble the work of whatever kind it may be by educational ideals 
and associations. 
A view of the plans and methods prevailing in the teachers’ train- 
ing schools will show that their work is ordered in strict accordance 
with the one principle of anticipating what the pupils are to do later 
on in life. In the apportionment of the time between the academic 
and the professional subjects, those training directly for the teacher’s 
future duties are given the greater prominence. Realizing the need 
of a review of the general branches, and yet the danger of allowing 
too much time for this, the regulations concerning it are so framed 
as to effect a carefully balanced compromise without unnecessary re- 
strictions. The statutes of Ziirich order that the future work of the 
teacher shall determine the allotment of time to each subject, as well 
as the character of the instruction; they also specify that the 
instruction in all branches shall be such that it may serve the pupil 
as an example in his future school work. To secure conformity to 
these regulations those who conduct the recitations are required to 
make thorough preparation for every lesson and to keep a book in 
which the plan of each lesson is preserved. Instruction material, 
textbooks, plans, programs, and apparatus are fully Ciscussed, so 
that the prospective teacher becomes familiar with them, and reaches 
an estimate of their value for his future work. The training is con- 
ducted with regard to the twofold capacity of a good teacher: Asa 
master of the details of his subject organically combined and, again, 
 
-P-A-G-E-346

as the instructor. specialist who has the skill to fashion the subject 
matter for presentation before the class. 
The official guides and study programs anticipate in their outlines 
the practical work of the pupil after his school days. The instruc- 
tion plan for the Canton of St. Gall sets up as a chief principle that 
instruction in fact should predominate. In grammar, for example, 
there is to be less theory than practice; this book should, in fact, be 
only a guide to the correct use of the language in speech and writing, 
an aid in composition. The outlines direct the pupil to write on 
what he has seen or heard or experienced, and hence really under- 
stood. Description is to be not simply a list of the characteristics 
of an object, but it is to be brought into living relation to nature 
and to man. In history the events of one’s country should be seen 
as related to what takes place about one’s home. In the geography 
of particular localities and countries careful attention is to be given 
to the life of the people of these places, their work, and arrange- 
ments peculiar to their life and calling. In natural history the 
pupil is to be led to see why the object under inspection has the 
peculiarities he discovers and how well it is adapted to its mode of 
existence, what relations of reciprocity it holds to other beings, what 
value it has for man, and how man accordingly is under obligation 
to protect it or destroy it. 
The report of Prof. Neuberth, of Christiania, supplying details 
of observations in the classrooms of Swiss schools, gives a glimpse 
of the actual work of teachers thus trained. He says: 
There was a quiet orderliness in all the activities of the pupils, no trace of 
indifference, no slovenliness, but evidence of painstaking care and of close 
cooperation between pupil and teacher. Some, to be sure, would fall below the 
good marks, but there was no real, and certainly, no general delinquency. The 
instructor was gifted with particular skill in framing his questions, a matter 
regarded of such importance that it is pointed out in the statutes of Ziirich as 
the special mark of a good teacher. The questions invariably compelled the 
pupils to think; instead of furnishing the form for the pupil’s answer, they 
left him to do this for himself. The teachers had, it appeared, carefully 
weighed and judged both the content and form of their questions, appearing 
to be indefatigable in training themselves to get their questions stated 
right. * * * The answers, which were given with very satisfactory readi- 
ness, often gave rise to new questions on the part of the teacher and, what was 
particularly noticeable, also on the part of the pupil. Though the deliberate- 
ness seen may be criticized for its dry outline character and for the absence 
of those spontaneous details that vitalize a lesson, the landmarks through the 
lesson were certainly charted and established, giving a chance to fill in with 
appropriate illustrative matter. 
The practical life issues of the teaching have, as would be expected, 
a large share in the deliberations of teachers at their professional 
meetings. During its session of September 30, 1918, the Ziirich 
Teachers’ Association discussed contemplated changes in the higher- 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  SWITZERLAND. 847 
grade classes and the courses to be given in these. As the suggested 
rearrangements involved time allotment to various subjects, the 
accepted or alleged values of these were again fully considered. It 
was evident that the world events and the recent experience of 
Switzerland made the teachers, even more than formerly, insist on 
positive answers to questions of a subject’s value to the pupil after 
his years at school. The propositions for the discussion of the 
classics were formulated with regard to these considerations: 
1, What significance dogs the culture of the ancients have for our own time? 
2. Does the instruction at our gymnasia correspond with this significance? 
8. Can not the same goal be reached in other ways, and, if so, what adaptation 
would it entail on the gymnasia of the future? 
Early in the discussion it was insisted that Latin, to maintain 
itself, must show that it leads to undoubted present-day values. 
Since the war, it was urged, important developments have taken place 
in the industrial and social life, with new social phases, outlook, and 
ideals—the position of the individual in the State, the place of woman 
as a member of the Commonwealth, the principle of the family unit, 
the international position of the State—time must be found to master 
and to organize new masses of details to prepare the pupil for the 
place he is now to take. Hence the question, 
Jan Latin be dropped as an obligatory study and the time thereby gained 
given to modern subjects, and can the study of the ancients be extended by 
reading good translations? Time should be found for psychology which, as it is 
now being developed, moves close to everyday activities; we constantly come 
into psychic relations with other people creating perplexing situations and 
problems. Outside of the schools the pupil is left slowly, painfully, and waste- 
fully to acquire the psychology which the schools, could more conveniently give 
him.’ 
Qn the other hand it was held that the western world has been 
influenced by the old classic world for centuries, and hence no matter 
how high it might tower above the old, its roots get their sustenance 
from the ancient soil. Our modern social organizations—state, 
church, school, society—are the result of a development in a straight 
line from the ancient world. If our present-day intellectual con- 
ditions are to be apprehended in their integrity and continuity of 
development, their origin and growth must be understood. 
Earlier in this account the pupil’s gradual release from lessons and 
entrance upon wage-earning employment has been mentioned as a 
feature in the school arrangements. The transition period thereby 
created gives opportunity for the teachers to render service to the 
pupils, no less important because it comes outside of the usual school 
programs. In a circular published January 1, 1916, and addressed 
by the school authorities of Ziirich to the teachers of district schools,   
1 Adapted from Schweizerische Lehrerzeitung, February, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-348
ee ne Ste nr et eee 
348 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18, 
higher grade schools, and folkschools, is set forth the duty of teachers 
to help pupils to find employment suited to their aptitudes. The 
school boards and teachers have, accordingly, cooperated with the 
Bureau of Statistics to ascertain what callings were most sought by 
pupils after completing the period of required attendance. The in- 
formation brought in showed what callings were most attractive to 
boys and girls, and also in what fields of endeavor their labor was 
most in demand. It was taken for granted that the teachers would 
understand that the prerequisites were bodily force and vitality, 
power of orderly and sustained thinking, congenial manners, resolu- 
tion in will and deed, and strength of character. The teacher through 
personal experience understands the pupil’s mental and physical ca- 
pabilities, and is, in consequence, prepared as no one else to assist 
the parents in selecting his life work. He would reach an under- 
standing with the parents, and perhaps take occasion to explain to 
them the moral as well as the industrial conditions depending on the 
choice, and the disadvantage of being without a trade or calling. If 
a choice is difficult to make, a pupil may, while yet at school; be 
guided in the general direction of a trade or one of the commercial 
lines. In performing this duty the teacher, it was pointed out, would 
often have a delicate task, for he might have to advise the choice of 
manual labor in cases where the parents would insist on something 
they regarded as higher as the calling for their children. If the 
economic conditions of the parents would permit the pupil to pass 
through only the primary school, or at most, two classes of the higher 
grade school, a calling consisting in the main of labor with the hands 
should not be looked upon as unsuitable, unless marked personal 
gifts pointed to something different. If, despite the statistical show- 
ing that clerical positions and offices are crowded by young appli- 
cants, a choice of this calling should seem wise, it becomes the 
‘teacher’s duty to point out that success here depends especially on 
tact and personal address, readiness in the use of several languages, 
skill in figures, and the ability to write a neat and legible hand. 
The circular of the Ziirich school authorities also states that young 
men and women should be advised that a great many of their num- 
ber—most of them insufficiently prepared—turn in the direction of 
a calling requiring scientific training. These people crowd the mid- 
dle schools, and when they have painfully and at great sacrifice gone 
through the courses, they find no opening commensurate with their 
hopes. It is an especially responsible task to guide those that con- 
template taking up the profession of teaching. The requisite en- 
dowments and possibilities are not always obvious at the age of 14 
or 15. The high order of mental power, with responsive tempera- 
ment and strength of character, is not always indicated by the marks 
pupils get as the result of examinations. The teacher should there- 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
OR ree en ce ene ee 
SWITZERLAND. 849 
fore be aware of his solemn duty to counteract the vanity of parents 
by aiding his pupils in a choice which saves both them and their 
parents from cruel disappointments. Again, he will have the more 
agreeable duty of encouraging the capable boy and girl whom he 
finds in his class to take up such scientific or professional lines as 
appear to be within their powers. In behalf of these he will have 
occasion to confer with the boards and officials that will come to 
| have charge of the pupils in the branches selected. As the question 
of expense is also involved, the teacher’s further service consists in 
helping the pupils to secure aid and stipends from such funds as are 
available. 
As an outcome of these early suggestions, educators began to con- 
sider the feasibility of a compendium in which this kind of service 
could be outlined in a form suitable to be taken up as a part of the 
scheduled work of certain types of schools. With this in view the 
educational board of Ziirich directed that a vocational guide book 
should be furnished pupils at nominal cost and be studied as an ob- 
ligatory subject in the eighth primary class and in the first two 
classes of the higher grade schools and that it should also be adopted 
for general use in the third class of the higher grade school. Atten- 
tion was called to the desirability of treating its content as instruc- 
tion material. The teacher was enjoined to stress the importance of 
training for skill and attention to duty and to find occasion to give 
his pupils helpful words of counsel as they entered on their chosen 
life work. He was reminded that the pupil’s choice of calling should 
not invariably be regarded as final; the main point was to help him 
earnestly to consider the choice. 
The movement here mentioned, which was well under way in 1916, 
has since then assumed new phases, and a scope beyond what was 
originally contemplated. In the annual report of the educational 
board some of the results for 1917 are given.’ In many districts and 
communities, says the report, boards for vocational consultation were 
established. The official school journal for March, 1917, published a 
comprehensive list of places where applicants might come for con- 
sultation. Many benevolent associations, among them the founda- 
tion “For Young People” (Fiir die Jugend) gave financial sup- 
port to the cause. The expectation was that a general service bureau 
for the entire Canton would be established. 
The Jugendwohlfahrt, Revue Suisse de Protection de la Jeunesse, 
under date of January, 1919, surveys in part what was accomplished 
during the years from 1916 to 1919. 
The suggestions published by the school board led to cooperation 
between the schools and the associations mentioned above. They

succeeded in getting 42 business places, factories, and other industrial 
plants made accessible to pupils who in company with their teachers 
desired to visit these to reach a clearer conception of the work there 
going on with the view of choosing a calling more intelligently. 
Similarly, they conferred with about 160 foremen of shops and trades 
to procure information for those pupils who expected to seek posi- 
tions as apprentices. Every teacher instructing final or graduating 
classes of the primary and the higher grade schools was furnished 
with a list of available positions and also of places in the city where 
practice in the trades could be secured. The teachers were also fur- 
nished with a list of applications from farmers who wished to employ 
boys having completed the school requirements; also a record of 
places where girls could find employment. Through the agencies 
mentioned, the instructors kept in touch with about 140 educational 
officials throughout the Canton, thereby extending the work until the 
city of Ziirich felt warranted in increasing the stipends and funds 
for promoting instruction in the trades.t 
As the importance of this form of school service became more 
extensively recognized, there was felt the need of organizing for its 
further prosecution. With this in view the occupational teachers of 
the Canton of Ziirich, in the autumn of 1918, effected an organization 
of 200 members. The constitution adopted by this body sets up its 
purpose thus: (1) To guard and to further the material and ideal 
interests of the occupational teachers; (2) to promote the profes- 
sional training of its members; (8) to cultivate right relations among 
the occupational schools, the folk schools, the trades, and industries; 
(4) to assist in procuring instruction material for the trade schools. 
The executive agencies of the association are to consist of permanent 
committees representing the various occupations. Their chief duty 
will be to further, in accordance with point 3, closer relations among 
the trades, the industries, and the schools. 
REGARD FOR THE PUPILS’ HEALTH. 
In order to render the most complete service for life the responsi- 
bility of watching over the pupils’ health has also been brought fully 
within the scope of the teachers’ duties. Childhood is obviously the 
time when physical defects of whatever kind should be discovered and 
remedied. Each Canton has specific regulations touching the phys- 
ical examination of the child upon entrance into the schools, the 
later periodical examinations, and reports of abnormal conditions dis- 
covered. 
The school laws and published regulations show that the physi- 
cian intrusted with this work must himself pass a rigid qualifying

test. He must hold the practicing physician’s license as required by 
the Federal Union. Employed by the department of education, he 
is not permitted individual practice. When the school board deals 
with questions of hygiene or sanitation, he may be summoned as an 
advisory member. His professional duties with regard to the schools 
and the pupils are minute and definite. In the Canton of Solothurn 
these include the examination of each individual pupil and inspection 
of every schoolhouse in towns and country districts. He is to visit 
schools for women’s work at least once a year and to make careful 
inspection of ventilation, heating, lighting, cleanliness, sewers, water 
supply, courts, gymnastic rooms, baths, pupils’ benches, school fur- 
niture, school utensils, and sanitation material. The physician must 
have regular hours for consultation; he must pass on all requests for 
exemption from attendance at school based on reasons of health; he 
determines whether pupils should be placed in classes organized for 
defectives, and whether or not they are to be sent to children’s sani- 
tariums; moreover, he enters on a special record cases where pupils 
are to be under observation for some time and where they need par- 
ticular consideration during the school work; at specified intervals 
he is to repeat the examination of eyes, ears, and teeth. Vaccination, 
disinfection, precautionary measures against communicable diseases, 
tuberculosis, and diseases of the scalp, attendance on pupils taken ill— 
these are matters to which the school physician must attend. He may, 
if he wishes, make his inspection at any time, even during school 
hours, though it is expected that he shall interfere with the recitation 
as little as possible. He is privileged to be present at recitations any 
time when this may help him to an insight into the pupils’ state of 
health. Early in the spring of 1919 the school periodicals discussed 
the physical. measurements of pupils with the view of studying a new 
type of school bench adapted to their health and comfort, an attempt 
in which the school physician evidently takes part. Other duties 
falling to him are to approve the plans for school buildings, to inspect 
the health certificates of men and women teachers, to teach them how 
to treat the defects they discover in the speech and voices of their 
pupils, how to deal with children suffering from nervous trouble, and, 
finally, to lecture to teachers and parents on topics of hygiene. Dur- 
ing the influenza epidemic pupils generally attempted to get back to 
school before complete recovery; hence they were in danger of in- 
curring bad after effects. The school physicians adopted the regula- 
tion that no pupil should be permitted to return until the seventh day 
after complete recovery: 
Various institutions having both curative and instructional pur- 
poses are found throughout Switzerland. Some of these are trade 
schools adapted to the capabilities of certain classes of defectives; but 
in all these institutions the instruction is subordinated to the restora-

tion of the pupils’ health. They often have the character of vacation — 
colonies, where pupils under the supervision of their teachers may 
come to recuperate. They are by no means limited to the poor, but 
well-to-do parents realize the benefits there received and send their 
children to these places in increasing numbers. 
One of this class is the forest school, where recitations are held in 
the open under the trees. The frst one was founded through com- 
munal initiative in Lausanne in 1908; in 1912 and 1918 two similar 
schools were founded in the Canton of Geneva through private en- 
deavor; later one was established in Neuenburg, and in 1914 another 
in the Canton of Ziirich. Their origin grew out of the needs of chil- 
dren with weak constitutions, to whom fresh air and nourishing food 
are the essentials. The location selected is in the edge of the forest; 
the period for the sessions is from May till late in September. 
In El Monitor de la Educacion Comun an account is given of 
another achievement of Swiss educational and medical endeavor, 
namely, a sun school, where certain classes of pupils in poor health 
may do a limited amount of school work while they are receiving 
the benefits of the curative properties of the sun’s rays. A school of 
this kind has been conducted summer and winter for 12 years at 
Leysin. The restoration to full usefulness under the treatment here 
provided is more remarkable in the case of children than in the case 
of adults, for the reason, undoubtedly, that the former can more 
readily comply with the necessary restrictions in regard to work. 
The location selected for these schools is at a high altitude, sometimes 
as high as 1,100 meters above sea level. The largest school has a 
farm completely equipped, under an experienced agronomist, himself 
a cured patient, where agriculture, dairying, and bee and fowl keep- 
ing are carried on. In so far as the treatment is adapted to the cure 
of tuberculosis, all lessons are subordinated to this purpose, the only 
mention of school proper being as one of the divisions of time among 
hours assigned to exercises for respiratory development, walks, and 
light agricultural or garden work. 
In his account the author shows how the mental training goes hand 
in hand with the physical. No special place is designated for recita- 
tions, the covered galleries adjoining the chalets being generally util- 
ized. A small, portable seat with writing desk attached, the frame 
higher than usual and requiring an upright posture, is furnished each 
pupil. When the weather is fine the class and the teacher roam in 
search of the most attractive place for recitations—it is the movable 
school par excellence. In addition to the lessons assigned, the teacher 
gives instruction on some theme arising out of the local topography, 
geology, botany, etc. 
From the ethical point of view the effect upon the child is most 
happy. From the first there is an evident growth in evenness of  
-P-A-G-E-353
  SWITZERLAND. _ 353 
temper and stability of character, effects appearing as a consequence 
of the physical hardening. 
The writer in El Monitor advocates the extension and adaptation 
of the best features above mentioned to the general public-school 
system. He does not attempt to prescribe the exact method by which 
this may be done, but he is confident that it can be worked out any- 
where by a study of local conditions. Various instances of its reali- 
zation are cited, as in Bern, Basel, and Geneva, where children from 
some of the public schools receive open-air instruction. In Lausanne, 
under the auspices of the city authorities, experiments in such in- 
struction have been made with children selected by the physicians. 
Various cities of neighboring Cantons have organized advanced 
classes for further experiments. Objections on the score of expense 
are easily met, as the latter are obviously light, the necessary equip- 
ment being of the very simplest. 
The Swiss journals and official reports also speak of other ar- 
rangements, both for the therapeutic treatment of school children 
and for special training in usefulness for those whom medical care 
is not able fully to restore. Under the direction of the health de- 
partment of Ziirich, children who suffer from defects of speech or 
ailments of the vocal organs are taken in hand.. This branch of the 
medical department is intended first of all to impart such knowl- 
edge and skill as will be of use to teachers having charge of pupils 
afflicted with troubles of the throat and the speech organs. Sessions 
for these purposes are held in the consultation rooms of the city 
clinics. Here teachers may receive such medical knowledge as will 
fit them to discover and relieve the less serious cages that they find 
in their classes and also to see the importance of promptly referring 
troublesome cases to the specialists. As instructors, they are taught 
what to do with pupils that stutter or speak with an unnatural nasal 
tone, to understand the troubles at the bottom of recurrent or 
chronic hoarseness, as well as partial or incipient stages of deafness. 
The diagnosis which the teacher is prepared to make will be the first 
step toward a course of corrective treatment. 
Again, unless the teacher understands troubles like these, he may 
classify an apparently backward child as below normal mentality, 
when the trouble is due to difficulties in the organs of speech or 
hearing. 
Teachers in Ziirich and Basel having charge of pupils of defective hearing 
explain the handicap under which these get an education. Many things at 
school and at home pass by them without leaving a trace. To restore these, 
so far as possible, to full communion with the outer world and thereby give 
their lives greater fullness is a worthy endeavor for the schools. It may be 
added that the knowledge requisite for this kind of service is in essentials also 
the foundation for elementary language instruction at schools with normal

children, at least when it is a question of raising the instruction from a purely 
mechanical method to one based on a knowledge of the speech organs.’ 
The Swiss school authorities are giving due attention to those 
pupils who suffer under some species of more or less marked psychic 
disturbance, which makes the usual school arrangements unsuited for 
their progress or recovery. Among the symptoms pointing to such 
cases are absent-mindedness, sudden rage, depression, unnatural 
activity of the imagination, delusions, and disturbed sleep. Thesé 
young sufferers are obviously entitled to treatment such as their 
conditions require, which can be given only in school homes espe- 
cially suited for them. Here they could be treated pathologically 
according to a plan adapted to each; the children could be segregated 
into groups to prevent harmful influences of one individual or class 
by another. These ideas are in part carried out in some of the 
cantonal schools, were special care is given to children of nervous 
temperament. Dr. Frank, of Ziirich, advises that— 
Parents of such children should be visited and thereby a clew obtained to a 
correct diagnosis of their troubles. The teaeher himself should not presume 
to play the part of a pathologist, for he might thereby do great harm, but he 
should train himself to detect these not uncommon instances of slight nervous 
disturbance. Sometimes a quiet word from the teacher will help to remove 
the slight psychic obstruction; in other cases the trouble is to be referred to 
the specialist before the damage becomes too great. 
Dr. Frank adds that offenses committed by these children should 
be dealt with in a manner different, usually gentler, from those of 
others. The experiences reported from such homes in Germany 
make it plain that a rather long period is necessary to effect a cure, 
though even a stay of five or six weeks has been beneficial. 
For those that can not be fully healed the teachers try to find 
work that comes within their powers. “This endeavor has not only 
an economic but a moral and ethical side, for it will help to keep 
these less fortunate people from feeling that they are a burden.” 
An attempt to realize this purpose was made in Basel in 1917 by 
opening a little trade school for subnormal children. 
At first it was known as the Weaver’s Shop, but it was by no means intended 
to be limited to the occupation implied in the name. Aid from the Canton and 
from private donors enabled the originators to carry the plan further. The 
teachers in charge found that sewing, stitching, covering cushions, and, to 
some extent weaving could very well be done by subnormal pupils. The results 
were, in fact, so encouraging as to warrant the extension of the idea by open- 
ing a school at Stapfelberg for subnormal girls. Since then funds have been 
secured from other sources, so that it is now contemplated to extend the scope 
of the endeavor by organizing rural homes where children of this class may 
become familiar with farm work and thereby be placed in the way of gaining 
their subsistence.

Movements of this kind have been accelerated by the war, and 
some new arrangements formerly regarded as of doubtful expediency 
have been put into practice. From the Canton of Aargau, for in- 
stance, several measures taken by the schools are reported that may 
be regarded as typical of what the schools are doing elsewhere— 
greater attention to exceptional, criminally inclined, or unhealthy 
children; increase in the facilities for free lunch and free clothing; 
more thorough health supervision; improved sanitary conditions of 
schools and pupils’ dormitories; reduction of the number of pupils in 
a class; conference on the choice of work, together with plans for 
free instruction of pupil apprentices; furnishing of writing and 
instruction material free of charge; remittance of tuition in the 
district schools; increase in the number of stipends for pupils; es- 
tablishing courses in commerce adapted for girls and manual work 
for boys; greater freedom in the change, election, and omission of 
subjects; increase in the efficiency of agencies to secure employment 
for pupils; reduction, under certain conditions, of the obligatory 
school period. 
In immediate connection with the programs of all schools, there 
is a marked tendency to investigate the value of work done at the 
home as compared with that done in the classroom. With the aid 
of experimental psychology, teachers have reached the conclusion 
(reported mainly in Schweizerische Lehrerzeitung for Feb. 23, 1918) 
that; 
The work done at school was generally superior to that done by an isolated 
pupil at home as home work. In copying and figuring at home it was ma- 
terially less than it should be in comparison with the same kind done at school. 
Qualitatively the comparison was also favorable to the school. As over against 
this, the experiments showed that in the case of certain pupils who were per- 
mitted to work quietly at home the work was better than that done in the 
class. In proportion as higher spiritual qualities entered into it, the assign- 
ment (imagination, judgment, presentation, literary style) done at home was 
better; in proportion as it involved the character of a memory performance, 
into which little of the pupil’s personality entered, the classroom work was 
better. 
Among other conclusions reached was that the pupil, if permitted 
to select his own time for doing the assignment, would often choose 
hours unsuited to mental work, such as the time immediately after 
ameal. Asthe pupil grows more mature, with clearer realization of his 
responsibility, the home work becomes more satisfactory. It is 
obviously the duty of the school authorities to see to it that pupils 
do not become overburdened by assignments to be done at home. 
When home work is necessary, it may indeed serve as a link between 
the home and the school because the parents would be under obligation 
to see to it that the children have the necessary time for the home 
assignment.

EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES DUE TO THE WAR. 
One of the first effects of the war on the schools in Switzerland, as 
elsewhere, was to furnish an incentive to break through the fixedness 
of the school programs and to respond to the immediate emergencies 
created. Occasions arose for extending the work of the schools in 
directions that had been thought to lie entirely beyond their province. 
The justification of these departures became topics for deliberations 
by school councils, leading inevitably to a new survey of the use- 
fulness and timeliness of the various branches of the curricula. A 
new outlook tending to take as its viewpoint the very fundamentals 
in education began to prevail. If this wholesome disturbance of 
the educational régime comes to crystallize into any new principle of 
teaching, its characterizing features will be a more direct regard for. 
the health and the entire career of a pupil, whether such regard can 
best be observed by the aid of books and lessons or in some other way. 
The pupil’s life interests will be more fully paramount; and the 
programs of schools will be fashioned toward these ends, no matter 
how they may come to deviate from the school traditions. 
The possibility of suspending the school routine for the sake of 
greater interests first appeared in the form of an endeavor to help 
relieve the economic stress the war created. As the Swiss school 
publications report the early instruction for the guidance of teachers 
in conducting this relief work, and as later issues of the same publi- 
cations give the actual achievement, it is possible to trace these 
endeavors through some of their stages. The Commission on In- 
dustrial Information in its report advises that those who have charge 
of placing city pupils as helpers should always have regard to the 
spontaneous willingness of the pupils to enter upon this kind of 
service. Of the two usual modes of making the labor of pupils 
available for agricultural productiveness, namely, as assistants dur- 
ing harvest and as independent tillers of gardens of their own, the 
latter is the more promising. To plant and produce crops of their 
own fosters a spirit of social responsibility and a sense of patriotic 
duty. Educationally, too, it has a superior value, for it is a form of 
experimentation in which the young agriculturist is spurred on to 
inform himself about the best method of tilling the plat allotted to 
him. It would be highly desirable, if city conditions would permit, 
to place school garden tillage on the program for the fifth and sixth 
years; even a further extension of it as a part of the curriculum 
would be advantageous if weather conditions would make it prac- 
ticable to give it a fixed place on the daily schedule. 
The school publications call attention to the considerations that 
determine the success of pupils assisting on the farms during the
-P-A-G-E-357
  SWITZERLAND. 357 
busy seasons. The experiences of city pupils on the farm have not 
always been satisfactory either to themselves or to the farmers. 
Usually the boys come with incorrect and distorted conceptions of 
country work, and are therefore cruelly disillusionized during the 
first days; and, again, the farmer does not always have a correct con- 
ception of the city pupils’ feelings and outlook. In participating in 
the work of the country it is best for the pupils to be accompanied 
by teachers and responsible persons who see to it that the stay in the 
country becomes profitable to their charges as well as to the farmers. 
There may not always be the needed accommodations, in which 
case the village schoolhouse could be used as a dormitory. Here the 
work group could be kept busy at some form of lesson during rainy 
days. The help should not be rendered’ gratis, but should be com- 
pensated by a wage; even though nominal, it would be an encourage- 
ment. 
The substance of the above suggestions, taken from the published 
instructions to Swiss teachers, is supplemented by information tell- 
ing of the actual endeavors to carry them into effect. Instances are 
cited of individual farmers who spoke highly of the efforts made by 
the city pupils to help, adding that some of them rendered very ma- 
terial aid in harvesting the rye. The pupils from a certain modern 
school exceeded the expectations placed upon them. One result of 
these experiments was that an organization of teachers at Basel deter- 
mined on a plan for carrying them further by making them a perma- 
nent school endeavor. To that end they invited pupils—boys and 
girls—to take part. The press was asked to assist by urging the 
farmers to avail themselves of the pupil’s help at the next harvest. 
To get the farmers themselves interested was regarded as most im- 
portant.* 
As the schools of Switzerland are closely identified in their work 
with the practical affairs of life, they were closely touched by the 
economic disturbances of the war. One immediate effect, already 
mentioned, was to organize for productiveness; another was the ne- 
cessity for augmenting the salaries of teachers. Where the burden 
of this emergency increment should fall was at first a matter of un- 
certainty. The Federal Government looked for a solution which 
would make the increase 400 francs, instead of 600 as asked by the 
teachers, and apportion it equally between the Canton and the Com- 
monwealth. Temporary increments were granted until 1919, when 
permanent salary improvements will undoubtedly be made, arrange- 
ments which appeared to be entirely satisfactory to the teachers. 
Despite the opportunities for more remunerative work, few teachers 
left their posts of duty for other employment.

Some dislocation of the work came about through the general 
economic stress. School boards received many applications from 
_pupils for dismissal before the expiration of the required time, be- 
cause the parents wished them released for remunerative employ- 
ment. In the interests of both the pupils and the schools, these re- 
quests were granted only in cases of extreme urgency. Considerable 
interruption of the work took place, however. In the spring of 1919, 
for instance, the irregularity had become so extensive that many 
schools concluded the year’s work without the usual semester exam- 
inations. Exercises of another kind were then substituted, but in 
no case did these have the character of tests. These arrangements 
were so much the more necessary as the influenza epidemic had, in 
many districts, compelled the schools to be closed for periods from 
weeks to months. 
Increased opportunities for wage earners so diminished the school 
attendance in some districts as to make it difficult to maintain the 
school as usual. In the Canton of Ziirich this led to the consolidation 
of several smaller districts, with the result of relieving somewhat 
the financial straits of each. In almost all these instances, the 
accounts state, the amalgamation, besides effecting a more equitable 
distribution of the school burdens, has been an advantage educa- 
tionally. Hence there is a growing tendency to bring together a 
still larger number of school groups into consolidated institutions. 
The union of two schools is often effected by making one primary 
and the other of higher grade. Even districts and schools denomi- 
nationally different from one another have in this way been satis- 
factorily brought together. In view of the ample supply of teachers 
the movement has not been in their interests, but its justification is 
upheld by a fairer distribution of the expenses, better equipment, 
better general instructional facilities, better utilization of the teach- 
ing force, a more ample supply of teaching material for each school. 
Again, it strengthens the community spirit and extends it into larger 
circles, widening the outlook by fuller sympathy with the people out- 
side of the immediate circle. 
Among the more permanent effects of the war is the desire to over- 
come the tardy processes of carrying out school reforms obviously 
needed. The procedure now in vogue in Switzerland and elsewhere 
is delayed by deliberations on petty objections until the needed legis- 
lation is postponed for years, by which time the social order has 
moved on toward new horizons. 
An instance of how the usual delay can be overcome was presented 
when, in response to requirements arising out of altered conditions, 
vocational selection was brought into the courses. The same condi- 
tions also gave rise to a new inquiry into the educational significance 
of the manual labor that pupils and teachers voluntarily performed
-P-A-G-E-359
SWITZERLAND. 859 
during the war. So favorably have educators been impressed with it 
that they are unwilling to take the backward step of having it dis- 
continued, hence prompt enactments may be expected that will pro- 
vide for its continuance and expansion. The direct practical aims 
that the schools set up insist on a corresponding directness on the 
part of the school authorities in making provisions for the new 
endeavors. The more independent of books the instruction becomes 
and the closer it draws to everyday life, the clearer becomes the neces- 
sity of a prompt response to the call for buildings to accommodate the 
new. activities—suitably equipped rooms for girls’ work, for boys’ 
industrial courses, school exercises in chemistry and physics, pupils’ 
lunch rooms, gymnastic rooms, playgrounds, and school gardens, 
Years ago some arrangements were begun for the cantonal and com- 
munity control of supplies and instruction material. The plan was 
gradually adopted by the Cantons of Solothurn, Baselstadt, St. Gall, 
and Thurgau; they effected joint contracts with publishing houses to 
furnish books at prices which became lower through consolidated pur- 
chases. Other Cantons cautiously adopted the same plan, though 
modified in details. Recently some form of the general plan has 
been adopted by almost all the Cantons; traditional objections have 
been more easily overcome, and it is now recognized more fully than 
before that the movement toward a socialization of the schools in this 
way is in perfect accord with the democracy of the people of 
Switzerland. ; 
The democratic trend of recent events is shown in the efforts to 
bring the problem of school inspection to a solution. When the 
schools of Switzerland became free from the church they came under 
the direction of secular inspectors who were governed by rules and 
directions which many teachers considered vexatious in their char- 
acter. The argument that such State inspectorship is necessary to 
maintain uniformity among the schools is not regarded as valid by 
the Swiss teachers as a body. The defects, they argue, now remain- 
ing in the schools can be remedied at least as readily by the associated 
teachers as by the official inspectors. Through their associations, 
therefore, teachers are urging that the inspection be taken over by 
their own organization to relieve the schools from some of the features 
of the State inspectorship that are objectionable to them. 
In the sessions of the school convention at Ziirich in September, 
1918, the political and social outlook created by the war obviously 
colored the educational deliberations. There was strong pressure in 
the direction of opening a still greater number of avenues toward 
practical work that. could be taken up by pupils differently gifted. 
But the question of the manner in which the school organizations 
could best be adapted toward these ends gave rise to conflicting views. 
It was maintained that if an early segregation toward vocational
-P-A-G-E-360
  
360 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18. 
aims be made possible, the selections could be made from fuller num- 
bers and on a broader basis. The trades would thereby gain many 
pupils who under the present organization are encouraged to go on 
to the middle school, though they are able to follow its courses only 
in part. By an early choice of calling the crowded middle schools 
would be relieved from the influx of a great many pupils whom neither 
gifts nor aims justify in going on with higher studies. 
On the other hand it was argued that an early departure in the 
direction of a chosen calling can not be made from the safe basis of 
sufficient data on the pupil’s endowments and aptitudes. Such early 
choice is therefore likely to be influenced by the social and economic 
position of the parents. The children should be encouraged to travel 
the same school highway, so far as possible, under the same teachers 
doing the same work, subject to the same tests for segregation toward 
special lines. An obligatory folk school with a lower division of six 
classes, and with these an organically united division of two classes— 
the latter adapted toward specialization of studies—would safeguard 
all interests of pupils and of society. Here would be room for manual 
work, real productive labor, which all pupils would be required to 
take up. The prestige work would attain by its elevation in the 
schools to a plane with other subjects, and the mutual participation in 
it by the pupils, were regarded as the most efficient way in which the 
schools could combat the notions of caste. It is realized that when 
pupils get together in the manipulation of actual things for industrial, 
productive, and, as such, patriotic purposes, social demarcations and 
cleavage tend to become obliterated. Subjects having much to do 
with criticism and scholastic achievements are a more favorable 
field for the growth and maintenance of distinctions among classes. 
Within its organized outlines it was insisted there must be scope for 
types and school units to specialize in industrial direction and at the 
same time to preserve coordinated interaction. These aims lie in the 
direction of decentralization and differences in administrative regu- 
lations with the view of adapting the work to fit the pupil’s calling 
and endowments and the wishes of his parents. In brief, the present 
complicated administrative system should be made simpler and more 
elastic, so that it can more readily respond to the expanding activities 
of the schools. 
At a teachers’ meeting in January, 1919, the discussion seemed to 
show that new conceptions are beginning to crystallize into definite 
and positive forms. While due regard will be given to the many 
new and useful activities that claim admission into the curricula, 
the teachers of Switzerland are not disposed to neglect the old and 
established branches. The fundamentals of the system have not 
been disturbed by the war. The classroom instruction will, here- 
after as before, comprise reading, writing, figuring; it will train the  
-P-A-G-E-361
i SWITZERLAND. 361 
memory and the judgment of children; it will give them constant 
practice in the analysis and the combination of thought processes. 
The schools will put forth their best endeavors to help lift the youth 
to a point above the narrow prejudice of egoism to sympathy with 
the world in which they live, out of limitations and seclusion, out of 
contempt for the concerns of the world, to a knowledge of actual life 
and to a participation in its struggles. Though there will be earnest 
attempts to remove the handicap which through birth or station 
may weigh upon a pupil, there will be no enthusiasm for the dead 
levels of mere equality. The social and educational values associ- 
ated with manual labor as a required part of the school program 
will be fully recognized. In the future as in the past, there will be 
steady efforts made to attain results, material as well as spiritual; 
but the Swiss teachers will continue to bear in mind that they must 
compensate for the material things which must come from abroad 
by spiritual values within their own borders. The war has en- 
hanced the fundamental values by stressing courage, energy, vitality, 
intelligence, and the love of freedom. In the interests of these values 
considerations of a merely scholastic character are, temporarily, at 
least, pushed into the background. The interaction of school units 
as a system will be subordinated to these ends. 
The sessions at the January meeting stated that the school system 
must never be permitted to assume the character of a business de- 
partment of the State, with mechanical functioning and: consequent 
deterioration of its spiritual life. The schools must be relieved from 
routine, fixity of form, and officialdom. Lesson plans and methods 
should not impose a rigid scheme of instruction material to be 
mastered or memorized; the aim should rather be to adhere to what- 
ever material or combination of material, or means, further the 
growth of the human intellect, and encourage its own early and 
spontaneous activity. Freedom, therefore, within the school régime 
is a dominant idea which recent events have made insistent. Human 
feeling begins loudly to protest against the thought that the most 
youthful, most original, and inherently most joyous period of life 
should be repressed by official formality. 
Again, the teachers advocated Government aid for students, arti- 
sans, and teachers, to pass some time in travel to study their re- 
spective callings so as to attain a mastery of what was best in usages 
prevailing abroad. This was one of the most direct ways fully to 
utilize whatever resources their own country afforded, and thereby 
rise to a position where they could worthily and efficiently help to 
rehabilitate the countries devasted by the war, 
While the teachers as an organization could advise in matters that 
the steady progress and the enlarged responsibilities of the schools 
now required, it remained for the Government to heed the full edu- 
‘ 
   
-P-A-G-E-362
  862 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-18, 
cational opportunities that the events of the past years had created. 
Switzerland occupies preeminently an international position, from 
which the harsher antipathies created by the war have been absent. 
According to a communication from Dr. Haveland Field, of Ziirich, 
dated November 3, 1918, this would be an ideal location for a me- 
morial educational institution from which sentiments of amity 
toward all peoples could radiate. Dr. Field calls attention to the 
aspirations which the Republic of Switzerland has in common with 
the Republic of the United States, making it especially appropriate 
for these two nations to take the initiative in the furtherance of this 
international idea. 
A few educational movements that have gained a new significance 
by the war have been mentioned. Others now uppermost are: 1. The 
war has shown that woman can do some things formerly thought im- 
possible to her. The schools will, therefore, adapt courses more fully 
to woman’s intellectual and physical constitution and to the new pos- 
sibilities brought within her sphere. 2. Teachers will cooperate more 
closely with the homes of the pupils. They will endeavor fully to 
enlist the sympathy of parents for the school work. 8. Democratiza- 
tion of the school control. 4. Decentralization of the working organ- 
ism of the system. 5. Stipends to be made more generally available 
for talented pupils. 6. Endeavors to guide pupils to select occupa- 
tions according to endowments. 7. The occupation of the teacher 
must be lifted above the influence of cliques. 8. Efforts to individual- 
ize the instruction. 9. Concentration of the instruction as studies and 
lessons. 10. Greater use of opportunities for exchange of teachers 
in foreign languages. 11. Exchange of abilities in city and country. 
12. Coordinating manual labor with other studies of the curriculum.

INTRODUCTION. 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. 
In the press reports bearing upon conditions in Russia since the 
outbreak of the revolution in March, 1917, little mention has been 
made of the tremendous changes that have shaken the entire educa- 
tional system in that country. One needs only read Vyestnik Vre- 
mennavo Pravitelstva (Messenger of the Provisional Government), 
Russia’s official gazette for the publication of the acts and decrees 
promulgated by the various ministries and other administrative 
bodies since the revolution, to become impressed with the deep and 
far-reaching reforms that have uprooted the entire system of the old 
education built on principles of autocracy and the privileges of the 
few. {A school system of such a type could not exist in a country 
striving for democracy. This was realized by the Provisional Govern- 
ment headed by Prince Lvov and later on by Alexander Kerenski.t 
To eradicate the evils of that system, to throw the schools open to 
the humble and the poor, to establish ‘‘a single absolutely secular 
school for all citizens,’ was the task at which the new authorities 
set to work. 
In this report an attempt is made to indicate the outstanding fea- 
tures of the new laws and regulations since the early days of the 
revolution. Unfortunately because of the scarcity of material it is 
impossible to tell at present how far the acts and decrees promul- 
gated by the various authorities and outlined in this report have 
  
1The Provisional Government with Prince Lvov at its head was organized soon after the outbreak of 
the revolution in March, 1917, with the understanding that it should hold power only until the Constituent 
Assembly should meet to decide Russia’s future form ofrule. Its first cabinet consisted of former members 
of the executive committee of the Imperial Duma. In July of the same year a more radical cabinet was 
formed under the leadership of Kerenski. A few months later (i. e., in November) the Provisional Gov- 
ernment was overthrown by the Councils of Workers, Soldiers, and Peasants Deputies, and the Soviet 
Government, with Lenin as Premier and Trotski as Minister of Foreign Affairs, was established instead.

been actually carried out. Nor is it possible to state with any degree 
of accuracy the educational changes that have taken place in Russia 
since the overthrow of Kerenski and the establishment of the Lenin- 
Trotski régime. For lack of information this report closes, there- 
fore, with the early months of the Bolshevist rule. 
The old autocracy, shattered so easily, left a heavy heritage. (As 
is well known, education in Russia is very imperfectly developed? 
The policy of the czars was to impart to the people knowledge that 
would strengthen their own imperialistic aims. Nevertheless, it 
differed with each monarch. The reign of Czar Alexander I (1801- 
1825), especially its first half, was marked by an endeavor to build 
up a national system of education; his successor, Nicholas I (1825— 
1855) saw in the spread of schools and popular education a dangerous 
weapon against autocracy. The system by which schools of differ- 
ent grades formed one continuous ascending chain was destroyed 
and a high barrier was set up between the elementary and secondary 
grades. 
Education was intended for the privileged classes only, and, 
although the school system was divided into four grades (parish 
school, district school, gymnasium, and university), leading from the 
primary school to the highest type of educational institution, no 
peasant’s children, according to the Ukase issued in 1813 and re- 
affirmed in 1827, were to be admitted beyond the district school. 
A few years later even this privilege was denied them, and the tiller 
of the soil had to be content with the parish school only, though in 
Russia 85 per cent of the total population is rural. 
The fourth Minister of Instruction, Shishkov, with the approval of 
Czar Alexander and in his presence, issued the following statement: 
Knowledge is useful only, when, like salt, it is used and offered in small measures 
according to the people’s circumstances and thcir needs. * * * To teach the mass 
of people, or even the majority of them, how to read will bring more harm than good.! 
This attitude was held by the higher authorities for a number of 
decades, and neither the abolition of serfdom in the sixties nor any 
subsequent reforms in Russian state affairs had any considerable effect 
upon educational conditions in that country. 
The accession of Alexander II (1855-1881) was marked by an intel- 
lectual revival and freedom of speech, but his assassination plunged 
the country into a state of reaction. A number of schools came 
under the control of the church and were governed by the Holy 
Synod, Russia’s highest ecclesiastical authority. The church au- 
thorities also opened a series of church schools, where the child spent 
his years in learning how to read church music and church Slavonic 
characters, the réle of which in eastern Europe may be compared to- 
the part played in the west by Latin. The inevitable cleavage be-

  EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. 865 
tween the secular public schools and the parochial church schools 
became wide and deep and the passing over of a pupil from a school 
of one type to that of another was attended with great difficulties. 
With Nicholas II (1894-1917) came a general revival of interest in 
educational matters, especially during the years following the Russo- 
Japanese war. The second part of his reign was marked by an era 
of many pedagogical congresses, of various schemes for reforming the 
schools, of incessant attempts toward the improvement of the methods 
of teaching and the organization of schools of a new type. This re- 
vival, taken up by the zemstvos (rural councils) and numerous private 
agencies, did not succeeed, however, in bringing about complete 
reform. The most thoroughly democratic reforms, for which the 
progressive elements had been striving for decades, became effective 
in the early months of new Russia, and only the unfortunate internal 
strife of later days prevented their complete realization. 
SECULARIZATION OF SCHOOLS. 
One of the first acts of the Provisional Government of 1917 was the 
secularization of church schools, in order to put the educational in- 
stitutions of the various departments under the control of the Ministry 
of Public Instruction. This important law, passed by the Provisional 
Government on June 20, 1917, reads in part:* 
For an actual and uniform realization of general instruction all the elementary 
schools, included in the school system, or all those which receive state grants for 
their upkeep or for the salaries of the personnel, among others, the church schools 
under the control of the Greek-Orthodox Church, as well as the church seminaries and 
two-class schools, are herewith transferred to the Department of Public Instruction.? 
\ This reform, as can be easily seen, was primarily directed against 
the orthodox parish church schools, the separatist tendencies of which 
proved to be a serious obstacle in the diffusion of popular education. 
The parish church schools differed widely in program and spirit from. 
the neighboring secular schools in the same district. They were under 
strict supervision of the clergy and had no connection with the 
zemstvo schools, which were under the jurisdiction of the Ministry 
of Public Instruction. 
The general standard of instruction in the parish schools was 
reputed to be below that of the zemstvo schools. The zemstvo social 
workers long tried in vain to take over the parochial institutions. 
Measures of the Minister of Public Instruction, aiming to increase the 
general expenditures for secular education, were often defeated on the 
ground that no similar provision was made for the parochial schools. 
The latter, although governed by the church, enjoyed grants appor- 
tioned by the state, which in 1916 alone, according to the Russian

Yearbook for that year, amounted to $11,076,383. The subsidy 
which the parochial schools received from the state in the end facili- 
tated their final transfer from the domain of the church to that of the 
state and made possible their supervision by one central authority. _ 
The final blow inflicted upon the ecclesiastical school authorities 
came from the Soviet. of the People’s Commissaries, which in its 
session of January 20, 1918, officially proclaimed the separation of 
church and school. The immediate effect of that measure was the 
elimination of the teaching of religion and theology in all the public 
schools and the doing away of all discrimination between pupils on 
religious grounds, ‘ 
ADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS. 
PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT. 
The administrative machinery by which the state maintained its 
control over education has undergone radical changes. For the 
better understanding of these changes, a word as to school adminis- 
tration under the old system seems necessary. 
Under the Czar’s régime the entire state was divided into 15 edu- 
cational districts, each headed by a curator. The curators, though 
nominated by the minister, had to be confirmed by the Czar. The 
power exercised by the curator within his own district was very large. 
It consisted not only in general supervision of all grades of schools, 
from the university downwards, but also the filling of vacancies in the 
ordinary staff of the schools. In addition, the curator had the right 
to nominate for confirmation by the minister persons fitted to dis- 
charge the functions of directors of secondary schools, and inspectors 
or deans of faculties in the universities. 
The actual inspection of secondary schools was done by his assist- 
ants, the district inspectors, while the supervision of elementary 
+ education was exercised by the directors of elementary schools and 
their subordinates, the inspectors of elementary schools. Matters 
pertaining to reforms within the sphere of authority of the curator 
were decided by the curator’s council, in which the district inspectors 
also participated. 
Through this system of school administration all grades of educa- 
tion were brought into direct relation with the curator and through 
him with the Minister of Public Instruction. As a counterpart to 
the ministerial schools, organized and controlled by the state, stood 
the educational institutions, established and maintained by the 
municipalities and zemstvos in those provinces where local self- 
governments were in existence. Though originally enjoying great 
liberties, the zemstvo schools were gradually correlated to the min-   
4 New Russian News, 1918, No. 38.

  EDUOATIONAT, CHANGES IN RUSSIA. * 867 
isterial schools by a system of provincial and district school coun- 
cils, which consisted of representatives of the ministry and the local 
self-government. 
The distinct feature of these councils was the active participation 
of the nobility who, encouraged by the state, played an important 
role in directing the policy of the schools. The inspectors of both 
the ministerial and zemstvo schools were looked upon with great 
disfavor by the zemstvo social workers, who considered these officials 
as state agents interested more in the teachers’ loyalty toward the 
ruling autocracy than in the education of the masses. The pro- 
found hatred which the ministerial inspectors had aroused manifested 
itself at the first teachers’ conference, held in Moscow, immediately 
after the downfall of the Czar. The cries there first heard openly of 
“Down with the hateful inspectors of the public schools, down with 
the council! The power of the school belongs to the teacher!” + 
augured ill for the system of school inspection, as hitherto practiced 
in Russia. 
This dictatorship ‘from above” broke down completely with the 
coming to power of the Provisional Government. The policy of the 
new school authorities was to refer the administration of the schools 
to the local self-governing bodies, the zemstvos and the municipali- 
ties. The.decree of May 8, 1917, regarding elementary education 
reads: 
In localities where the provincial or district zemstvos are in existence, the muni- 
cipal, district, and provincial school councils are to be abolished. In place of the 
abolished councils the administration of elementary education is temporarily laid 
upon provincial or district zemstvos, while in cities with a municipal school council 
administration elementary education is given over to the municipal duma.? 
By placing the educational affairs in the hands of the local authori- 
ties, the post of the curator became superfluous and was abolished by 
the decree of September 26, 1917. With it went, as a natural con- 
sequence, the Curator’s Council and its autocratic machinery, the 
directorates and inspectorates of schools.* 
Although the new Ministry of Public Instruction outlined a com- 
prehensive and far-reaching program for the reconstruction of 
schools, it encountered powerful opposition on the part of the radical 
elements of Russian society. This was due to the old deeply rooted 
distrust of reforms emanating from governmental bureaus, where the 
people had hitherto no voice. The Workers’, Soldiers’, and Peasants’ 
Deputies demanded the organization of a special State Committee of 
Public Instruction attached to the ministry and representative of the 
people. Organized in May, 1917, the State Commission of Public 
Instruction comprised representatives of the All-Russian Soviets of

    368 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, representatives from the union of 
towns, zemstvos, and various other organizations, mostly political. 
Educational workers were represented in a small minority. The 
function of this committee was to devise laws and see that these were 
laid before the Provisional Government through the channels of the 
ministry. The sessions of the state committee bore many fruits. 
Regulations were issued concerning elementary education,! the en- 
forcement of compulsory education,’ the administration of public 
schools, and the autonomy of the middle schools. The committee 
recommended also the introduction of the new spelling in public 
schools, higher salaries for elementary-school teachers, and various 
other reforms, general and particular.” 
The decision of the state committee with regard to administration 
rests on the principle, so familiar to us, that public education is the 
affair of the local self-governments, by which body it should be ad- 
ministered. For the immediate administration of schools there 
should be formed special provincial and district boards of public 
instruction. As to jurisdiction, according to the state committee, 
the local boards should care, among other things, for the general 
maintenance of laws and regulations pertaining to public education, 
the administration of educational institutions, the coordination of 
all activities pertaining to public education in a given area, and the 
collection of statistical data on education. In addition; each pro- 
vincial zemstvo may distribute state grants for education to the 
various districts and towns according to the decisions of the Pro- 
vincial Zemstvo Assemblies.? 
The reforms mentioned above, whether puting or actually intro- 
duced, represent, as can be easily seen, the general trend of democrati- 
pared of schools, as found in other democratic countries. The 
action of the Provisional Government was not revolutionary. Local 
self-governments existed in Russia for over 50 years, and, by granting 
them a voice in educational affairs, the provisional authorities simply 
complied with the wishes of those who Raves in vain sought this 
privilege for the past five decades. H 
Autonomy of middle schools—The projected reforms of the State 
Committee relating to the autonomy of middle schools received 
cordial support of the Minister of Public Instruction, Salazkin, A bill 
introduced in September, 1917, for the approval of the Provisional 
Government places the control of all schools above the primary 
grades in the hands of the Council of Education. According to this 
bill, ‘the immediate control of the higher elementary schools, boys’ 
and girls’ progymnasiums and gymnasiums, real schools, normal 
schools, and other institutions receiving State grants in full, or sub-

sidized by local funds, be it for purely educational or for adminis- 
trative purposes, is herewith intrusted to the Council of Education.” 
This body is to comprise, besides the teaching personnel and the 
school physician, representatives of the loca] self-government and 
the parents’ organizations, wherever such are in existence. The 
number of the parents’ representatives in the Council of Education 
is not to exceed one-third of the members of the teaching personnel. 
In institutions newly created the right to elect a director or other 
persons holding administrative positions is reserved to the provincial 
zemstvo boards or to the district or city boards, as the case may be. 
The members of the Council of Education have the right to elect 
the teaching staff from the list of candidates submitted to it by the 
director or by some other person at the head of the institution. At 
the end of the school year, upon the written request of not less than 
one-third of the total number of members comprising the Council of 
Education, the teachers’ tenure of office may be subjected to a new 
vote. In extreme cases of unsatisfactory conduct or lack of skill on 
the part of the teacher, such reballoting may take place even before 
the end of the school year." 
BOLSHEVIK REGIME. 
With the overthrow of Kerenski in November, 1917, and the 
coming to power of the Bolsheviki, the educational policy was again 
revised. This time the control of schools passed from the hands of 
the zemstvos to those of the soviets, representing the masses only. 
The rules, as issued by the Commissariat of Education,? read as 
follows: 
1. For the proper conduct of affairs pertaining to public education in and outside 
of school, also to normal schools (teachers’ seminaries), there are being organized 
regional, provincial, municipal, district, and county soviets of public education at- 
tached to the soviets of workers’, soldiers’, and peasants’ deputies. This refers to 
institutions with a general or technical bias. 
2. The soviets of public education consist of (a) representatives of all organizations 
having the right to send delegates to the soviets of workers’, soldiers’, and peasants’ 
deputies; (b) representatives of local educators and students (among others also from 
technical schools); (c) experts especially invited for consultation. 
Nore.—The total number of representatives from educators and students must not 
exceed one-third of the total membership of the soviet of public education. 
8. General meetings of the soviets of public education take place, if advisable, 
once a month, but not less than once in three months. 
4, The soviet of public education elects an executive committee from its own 
amembers. 2 
5. All appropriations from the State treasury are to be solicited by the regional and 
provincial soviets of public education. 
1Vyestnik Vrem. Prav., 1917, No. 161. 
2Under the Bolshevik régime the ministries were changed to commissariats, the post of the minister 
being superseded by a “‘people’s commissary,” appointed by the Central Executive Committee of All- 
Russian Assembly of Soviets.

6. The soviets of public education work under the direction of the soviets of deputies 
and in accord with the views of the latter institution. In respect to pedagogical and 
financial questions the soviets enjoy autonomy and are accountable to higher author- 
ities in the following order: County soviet of public education, district soviet of public 
education, provincial soviet of public education, regional soviet of public education, 
and, finally, the State commission of education. 
7. The opening of new schools and the sequestration of private educational insti- 
tutions, in case the expenditures are covered by the State, are to be undertaken with 
the exclusive approval of the State commission through the channels of the soviets 
of public education. 
8. The soviets of public education shall extend their activities to the people’s 
universities, public courses, exhibitions, theaters, motion pictures, excursions, 
libraries, etc. 
9. In localities where the zemstvos and municipalities have not yet ceased their 
activities the soviets will take charge of the work pertaining to public instruction. 
All school apparatus, municipal and rural, as well as all sources of income, will be 
transferred to the soviets. 
10. The soviets of workers’, soldiers’, and peasants’ deputies have the right to make 
only such changes as are compatible with local conditions.} 
PARENTS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
The rdle of parents’ organization in the school council mentioned 
in the previous section is a recent development and sprang, like so 
many reforms in Russia, out of sheer necessity. 
By the constant recasting of schedules in secondary schools the 
school authorities under the old régime curtailed the subjects most 
in touch with modern life. Natural sciences and history were 
reduced to a minimum and Greek and Latin studies reinforced. 
The teaching in the boys’ and girls’ gymnasiums became formal 
and unattractive. 
Protests emanating from the intelligent circles of society became 
more and more emphatic, until dissatisfaction culminated in 1905 in 
a general strike not only in university institutions, a common phe- 
nomenon in Russia, but also among high-school pupils. The strike, 
spreading throughout the length and breadth of the Empire, made 
the authorities realize that to cope with the high-school problem a radi- 
cal change in the system was imperative. It became clear to them 
that to win the pupils’ confidence was beyond their power, and that 
to save the situation the parents’ cooperation must be first invited. 
The importance of the influence of parents in school life had been 
realized by the school authorities much earlier, notably in 1899, 
when the Minister of Public Instruction, Bogolyepov, bent upon 
carrying out reforms in the secondary schools of Russia, issued a 
circular addressed to the curators of the educational districts, admit- 
ting the justice of many complaints of the defects in the secondary 
schools. 
  
1 Izy. Sov. Rab. i Sold. Deput., 1918, No. 37.
-P-A-G-E-371
  EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. 871 
- As a result of this admission a conference was summoned by 
P. A. Nekrasov, curator of the Moscow district, in which about 200 
educators, mainly teachers and directors of secondary schools, took 
part and formulated recommendations which, timely as they were, 
did not procure the participation of parents in the affairs of the 
school. A closer rapprochement followed only a few years later, 
when the school youth, inspired by the liberalizing movements of 
1905, began to revolt from the restriction of the school régime, 
causing great perturbation among the school authorities. It was 
then that the latter turned to the parents for help. Officially 
invited for the first time by the school authorities to lend a helping 
hand the parents literally ‘‘burst’’ into the schoolroom, and in the 
hour of distress rescued the situation. 
With the slogan that the school should be a temple of knowledge, 
and not of politics, the parents’ commitees set to work. Their 
influence was at once most beneficial. The pedagogical circles had 
extended to them their sympathies and won their cooperation. 
Owing to the influence of the parents’ committee interest in the 
school studies was revived, the students appeased, and politics, at 
least outwardly, banished from the schoolroom. The parents’ 
committees established cordial relations between teachers and 
pupils. Leaving no stone unturned, they responded to all the needs 
of the pupils’ school life. In this they saw their right and duty. 
By instituting special summer courses the parents’ organizations 
assisted the backward students in subjects in which they had pre- 
viously failed. They suggested to the school authorities that the 
home lessons be modified by furnishing exact tables relative to the 
home studies. They reported the progress their children made 
with the various textbooks; they obtained numerous editions of 
the same book, so as to enable the children to read and discuss in 
the classroom books familiar to all. They supplied school libraries 
with additional books, issued catalogues of the best books available, 
and distributed them for the guidance of parents in their own as 
well as in other localities. Their activities extended to the improve- 
ment of. the pupils’ entertainments and amusements. Last, but 
not least, they took an active interest in school luncheons and 
sanitation. 
These activities, at first welcomed, received, with the setting in 
of the reactionary spirit in 1907, a decided check on the part of the 
school authorities, who viewed with suspicion the ever-growing 
influence of the parents’ organizations. 
With the outbreak of the revolution the parents’ committees came 
again to their own. That the parents’ cooperation in school affairs 
is valued highly is proved by the bill of September, 1917, which 
   
-P-A-G-E-372
872 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
allotted to the parents of school children a conspicuous place in 
the council of educators. 
ABOLITION OF RESTRICTIONS. 
NATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS GROUPS, 
Among the new- measures introduced in Russia since the rerolu- 
tion the most vital one is the decree abolishing all restrictions 
hitherto imposed upon various nationalities, denominations, and 
creeds. For instance, Jews were formerly admitted to secondary 
schools and universities only by percentage. Their admission to 
schools within the so-called Jewish pale—that is, roughly speaking, 
Poland and southwestern Russia—was limited to 10 per cent, in 
other provincial universities to 5 per cent, and in Petrograd and 
Moscow to 2 per cent of the total enrollment of students. Further- 
more, the non-Russian population in Provinces like Poland, Ukrainia, 
Lithuania, etc., once independent States, had to submit to the 
Russifying policy of the former Government and for lack of facilities 
to send their children to schools in which the use of their own native 
language was forbidden. 
These conditions appear to have vanished with the ‘‘Declaration 
of the rights of the peoples,” issued by the All-Russian Soviet, first 
in June and then in November, 1917. The tenets of this declaration 
are as follows: 
1. The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of Russia. 
2. The right of the peoples to free self-determination even to the point of separa- 
tion and establishment of independent states. 
* 8, Abolition of all racial and religious privileges and restrictions. 
4, Free development of the nations and ethnographic groups which were merged into 
the Russian Empire. 
From a pedagogical point of view the restrictions which prevented 
the various nations and ethnographic groups, constituting 57 per 
cent of the total population of Russia, from establishing and con- 
‘ducting their own private schools were forthwith removed. They 
were permitted to institute their own schools and use their national 
language as a medium of instruction. 
It is also significant that the State itself made provisions for the 
introduction of the local language into normal schools of those prov- 
inces where the non-Russian population constituted the majority.t 
PRIVATE INSTRUCTION, 
Private instruction imparted at home was formerly considered 
an offense under some conditions and punished accordingly. The 
new bill introduced by the Minister of Public Instruction and ratified 
  
a Vyestnik Vremennavo Pravitelstva, 1917, No. 104,
-P-A-G-E-373
  EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA, 873 
by the Provisional Government abolished all restrictions relative 
to private instruction and thus paved the way for private individuals 
eager to assist the Government in wiping out illiteracy. 
Commenting upon this bill, the Vyestnik Vremennavo Pravitelstva, 
1917, No. 79, states: 
According to the laws now in force it is the duty of the educational and administrative 
authorities to find out by observation what individuals practice the art of teaching 
children in private homes, if such persons possess the necessary certificate, otherwise 
to prosecute them according to the law. The articles of law pertaining to private 
instruction have at present, with the entire change of structure of society, lost their 
significance, while they still retain the force of law in the civil code. For this reason 
the Minister of Public Instruction has introduced for the approval of the Provisional 
Government a bill aiming to abolish all restrictions regarding teaching in private 
homes, 
EDUCATIONAL LADDER. 
The reorganization of the entire school system, long a dream of 
the most progressive elements of the Russian society, was effected 
by a decree issued by the Provisional Government in June, 1917. 
According to the Russkiya Vyedomosti, 1917, No. 144, all State 
schools are to run in two parallel lines, cultural and vocational. 
Each grade leads directly to the next higher of the same line or to a 
corresponding grade of the parallel line. The pupils begin with the 
elementary school and pass then either to a lower vocational school 
or continue the general course by entering a higher elementary one, 
corresponding to the first four classes of the present gymnasium. 
The gymnasium is to undergo a gradual change and be reduced to a 
four-class school, whereby the first four classes of the present gym- 
nasium are to be turned into a higher elementary school. With 
the higher elementary school the cycle of elementary education comes 
to an end. 
From the higher elementary school the pupil passes to the secondary 
trade school or to the four-class gymnasium which is to correspond 
to the last four classes of the present gymnasium (5th-8th classes, 
inclusive). This cycle completes the pupil’s secondary education. 
Finally, the four-class gymnasium is to pave the way to the uni- 
versity or to a higher technical or professional school, 
This act abolishes all barriers and offers free and uniform access 
to all grades of education. Moreover the school schedule is to be 
so arranged as to enable the pupils to change the academic for a voca- 
tional course and vice versa. 
A similar reform with regard to the city schools received con- 
siderable attention on the part of the late Czar’s liberal Minister of 
Instruction, Ignatyev, whose proposals for better schools were 
widely commended by the exponents of educational reform.

To make this change real the Provisional Government assigned 
the following sum for education in 1917 to supplement the budget 
fixed by the old authorities: 
The sum of $2,707,857 “for the opening of four-class gymnasiums 
and real-schools,! new higher elementary schools, also for the open- 
ing and upkeep of teachers’ institutes and normal schools. 
Out of this sum it was proposed to spend: 
(a) $546,750 for the opening of 100 four-class gymnasiums and 
real-schools. 
(b) $1,291,725 for the opening of new higher elementary schools 
and for various needs of these schools, as provided by law. 
(c) $110,000 for the opening and upkeep of 5 teachers’ institutes. 
(d) $759,382 for the opening of 25 normal schools.?

The increase for middle education in 1916 was $554,023; in 1917, 
$3,039,662. TEACHERS’ TRAINING INSTITUTIONS.* 
The reorganization of the elementary and higher schools, by 
which the present gymnasium is to be divided into a higher elemen- 
tary and a high school institution, led the Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion, Manuilov, to issue a new program affecting the status of 
Teachers’ Training Institutions, which comprise the normal schools 
(uchitelskiya seminarii) and the teachers’ institutes (uchitelskiye 
instituty). 
(a) Normal schools.—The decree of June 14, 1917, defines the 
status of the normal schools, the main source for supplying teachers 
in the primary grades, as follows: 
1. The normal schools are secondary institutions and consist of 
four classes. They admit men, women, or both. 
2. The normal schools may have one or two preparatory or 
parallel classes. 
3. Admission to the preparatory class is afforded to graduates of 
a two-class elementary school, while admission to the first class of a   
1 The gymnasiums offer classical instruction, while the real-schools are nonclassical, with a technical bias.

normal school requires graduation from a higher elementary school 
or its equivalent. : 
4. Candidates who pass a special entrance examination may also 
be accepted. 
5. For practical work of the prospective teachers there is to be 
attached to the normal school a two-class elementary school, with 
a six-year course. 
Further, the regulation requires all existing teachers’ schools 
with an elementary program to be raised to the standard of normal 
schools. This change is to take place within two years from the 
date of publication of this regulation. 
The teachers’ schools were previously of low standard and their 
course differed little from the program of a two-class primary 
school. 
(6) Teachers’ institutes.—While the normal schools are intended to 
qualify candidates for the teaching profession in the lower elernen- 
tary schools, the teachers’ institutes prepare candidates to occupy 
positions in the higher elementary schools. The latter, as already 
explained, correspond in scope to the first four classes of the present 
gymnasium. 
The following statements, issued by the Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion, under date of June 14, 1917, show the new regulations, as 
affecting the teachers’ institutes: 
1. The teachers’ institutes may admit men, women, or both. 
2. Admission to the first class at the teachers’ institute is granted 
to graduates of normal schools, boys’ or girls’ gymnasiums, real- 
schools with an additional class, higher commercial schools, and 
similar institutions. Admission is restricted to candidates who 
have been in the school service for not less than two years. 
3. For the purpose of giving students practice in teaching there 
is to be attached to each institute a higher elementary school, 
teaching in which is required of all students. 
4. The course of study in teachers’ institutes covers three years 
and is divided into a general course—compulsory for all thestudents— 
and a special, corresponding to the group of subjects in which the 
candidate prefers to specialize. The special course consists of the 
following groups: Literary-historical, physico-mathematical, and 
scientific. 
Students who have successfully completed a certain course in the 
teachers’ institute receive the title of ‘‘Teacher in a Higher Ele- 
mentary School” in a particular group of subjects. Admission to 
the examination for a license as such is afforded only to candidates 
who have taught school for at least two years.*

REFORM IN SPELLING. 
Closely connected with the reforms already mentioned is that in 
spelling. Some time ago such scientists and recognized experts on 
the subject as the members of the Academy Fortunatov and Shakh- 
matov pointed out the necessity of such a reform. Their views were 
based on the fact that the former orthography had no scientific 
foundation; that it was arbitrary, and the result of an inadequate 
knowledge of the Russian language on the part of the old phil- 
ologists. The new spelling was adopted on May 11, 1917, by a 
special committee charged with the work. The Minister of Public 
Instruction, A. Manuilov, referring to the reform which he was 
instrumental in introducing into the school system, remarks: 
The reform worked out by a special committee attached to the Academy of Science 
and supported by the state committee of the Ministry of Public Instruction presents 
a system based on scientific principles which, while retaining all the elements of the 
former orthography, aspires to bring uniformity between the written word on the one 
side and its phonetic composition and etymological construction on the other.! 
From a practical point of view the reform in spelling will undoubt- 
edly facilitate the studies of elementary school pupils by saving for 
more serious studies time that was formerly consumed in learning all 
the minutie of a spelling that had no justification. 
The spelling, as adopted by the school authorities, consists in the 
elimination from the Russian alphabet of four letters: 4 (yat); i (i); 
6 (phita); and +, the so-called ‘‘hard sound.” ‘The pronunciation 
of the first three letters is identical, respectively, with e (ye); w(i), and 
¢ (f). The hard sound, though frequently used at the end of words 
ending with a consonant, is not pronounced. 
The new spelling was introduced into Russian schools in the 
lowest grades first. Students who started school with the old spell- 
ing were allowed to adhere to it, or adopt the new one. No mixed 
spelling was, however, to be tolerated. 
NEW TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS. 
Under the old system textbooks intended for use in Russian schools 
had to be approved by the Scientific Committee, the chairman of 
which was appointed directly by the Emperor. But the new order 
of things demanded new standards. A committee appointed by the 
Minister of Public Instruction of the Provisional Government was 
charged to further the publications of school books compatible with the 
principles of a growing democracy. The Bolshevik authorities went 
much further. In this connection it is interesting to note a bill of 
December, 1917, approved by the Commissary of Public Instruc- 
tion, A. Lunacharski, and apparently adopted by the general soviet.   
2 Vyestnik Vrem, Pr., 1917, No. 96,
-P-A-G-E-377
EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. Bu" 
By this bill the state may take over and enjoy the proceeds from 
any literary production for the period of five years, provided that at 
least 15 years shall have elapsed after its author’s death. The work 
thus made the property of the state must show sufficient artistic 
and literary value. It is to be published in two editions, an aca- 
demic edition with a full text, and a popular edition with abridged 
text. By this means the state authorities hope to counteract the 
influence of poor and vicious books and replace them with literature 
of a more healthy type.! 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The question of the reorganization of the universities, which the 
events in Russia have rendered urgent, received considerable atten- 
tion on the part of the Provisional Government. Subsidized by 
the State, the Russian universities formed an integral part of the 
Russian Empire, or the Russian autocracy, which was free from the 
first so to impress its own stamp upon them as to mold them to its 
own aims. ‘ 
The effect of this practice upon professors and students prompted 
the Provisional Government in June, 1917, to issue a decree which 
did away with all State interference and put the highest institutions 
of learning on a plane of autonomy never paralleled in the history 
of Russian schools. The university council, stripped of its power 
by the statute of 1884, became again an important factor in the life 
of the university; and the system of election of university officers, 
until now limited to the rector, the dean, and the secretaries of 
the various faculties, was extended to include also the university 
professors. 
Election of professors.—These according to the bill of June 17, 
1917, are to be elected by a unique combination of competition and 
recommendation. Persons desirous of securing professorships lodge 
application with the dean of the faculty. The members of the 
faculty and the university council, as well as the members of other 
higher educational institutions, may present their own candidates 
and upon ‘invitation of the university discuss the merits of the 
prospective professors. The candidates are then subjected to a 
vote by the faculty and the election returns presented to the uni- 
versity council. In order to be elected the candidate polling the 
highest vote in the faculty must also receive the majority vote in 
the university council. He is then elected, subject to confirmation 
by the minister. In case of disapproval the latter must present 
his reasons to the university council within the period of two months. 
Failure to confirm a candidate leads to elections of a new candidate.

Requirements for candidates for university chairs—A project which 
was worked out by the commission on the reorganization of higher 
education summoned by the assistant minister, Vernadski, in charge 
of higher education, states the following requirements for candidates 
for university chairs: (1) To become a regular ordinary or salaried 
professor the candidate must have had at least five years of expe- 
rience as lecturer in one of the higher institutions of learning; to 
become an extraordinary or unsalaried professor only three years 
of experience. (2) Russian scientists, distinguished for their edu- 
cational activities and possessing the degree of doctor of philosophy 
conferred by foreign universities, are also eligible to professorships.’ 
Docents.—The post of docent, instituted in 1863 and abolished 
in 1884, was reestablished by a ministerial circular of June 24, 1917. 
This reads: 
In all Russian State universities the post of docent shall be reestablished as fol- 
lows: 
1. Docents shall receive a salary of $1,200 per annum, with two increments of 
$175 each after the fifth and tenth years of service. 
2. The assignment of docents to the various chairs is left to the faculty subject to 
confirmation by the university council. 
3. Persons holding doctor’s or master’s degrees, or those not possessing such degrees 
but otherwise meeting the requirements of private docents and actually having had 
a three years’ experience in teaching, are eligible to fill vacancies. 
4. The election of docents, subject to confirmation by the council, is made by the 
faculty from the number of candidates proposed by its members. 
5. Docents have a right to participate in faculty meetings with a voice on all sub- 
jects except that pertaining to the election of professors. 
Admission of students——The admission of students to higher 
educational institutions, until now restricted by various laws and 
regulations bearing upon the students’ nationality, creed, and 
domicile, has undergone a sweeping change since the publication 
of the ministerial circular of June 13, 1917. How this measure 
affects nonorthodox and non-Russian students has been discussed 
in another connection. Here it may be of interest to mention the 
reform with regard to the students’ domicile. As already stated, 
Russia was divided into 15 educational districts with a university 
in each of 10 of these. According to measures adopted by the 
ministry in 1899, students living in a district possessing a university 
could not freely select a higher institution outside their own educa- 
tional border line. The new regulation does away with this law of 
bondage and leaves to the student a free choice between universities 
existing throughout Russia at large. Of particular interest are the 
following clauses of the circular: 
1. The university admits on equal basis persons of both sexes with no distinction 
as to nationality and creed, providing such persons possess diplomas or certificates 
of maturity or the equivalent. 
  
1 Vyestnik Vr. Pr., 1917, No. 161.
-P-A-G-E-379
  EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. 379: 
2. Students wishing to change the course of study and also those coming from other 
‘universities in or outside of Russia are admitted on the same basis as new students, 
-credit for work done elsewhere being decided by the respective departments. 
3. Special students, men and women, who possess a high-school education, may 
‘become regular students if they pass an examination for a certificate of maturity. 
In such cases credit may be granted for academic work done previously, 
NEW UNIVERSITIES AND FACULTIES, 
Plans to increase the number of universities and faculties, the lack 
of which has been keenly felt by the intelligent circles of society, came 
to fruition in the first year after the fall of the Empire. 
The eagerness of certain cities to assist the Government in its work 
by offering large sums of money for the building of the proposed new 
universities, and the rapidity with which some of the reforms have 
been put into operation, prove that the time was fully ripe in Russia 
for measures so long delayed. But the credit for these reforms be- 
longs not solely to the Provisional Government. Changes in univer- 
‘sity education were also planned by the prerevolutionary authorities, 
The March days of 1917 simply accelerated the course of events, and 
what under ordinary circumstances would have taken years, perhaps 
decades, to accomplish, was then done overnight. 
The following are the most important measures: The Demidov 
Lyceum in Yaroslav, intended exclusively for the study of laws and 
‘organized on the same principle as the faculty of laws in a university, 
was transformed in July, 1917, into Yaroslav university and organi- 
-eally connected with the faculty of law. The medical, physico- 
mathematical, and historico-philological faculties were to be insti- 
tuted at a later date. 
Other changes created by the new authorities include the trans- 
forming of the Perm branch of the Petrograd university into an 
independent university institution, which opened last year with all 
the four faculties mentioned. In addition, the Warsaw university, 
which, in the early days of the German occupation of the western 
front in Russia, was transferred to Rostov-on-the-Don, underwent a 
radical change. The Warsaw university proper was abolished and 
in its stead was created the Don university, named after Rostov-on- 
the-Don, in which city it is situated. The Don university opened 
in July, 1917, with all the four faculties. The action of the authorities 
with regard to the Warsaw institution will become intelligible, if we 
bear in mind that the Warsaw university was intended to serve the 
needs of the Polish population. With the creation of the new Polish 
state, however, the Warsaw university in a Russian city had obviously 
no raison d’étre and was supplanted by an institution definitely 
suited to its environment. 
The two young Russian universities—one in Saratov and one in 
Tomsk—created shortly before the revolution by the then liberal 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  
  380 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
minister Ignatyev, received considerable attention on the part of 
the new authorities. By an early act of the Provisional Government 
the Saratov university was expanded to include the physico- 
mathematical, historico-philological, and the law faculties, while to 
the Tomsk university were added the physico-mathematical and 
historico-philological faculties. 
Plans were also underway for the opening of two more universities— 
one in Irkutsk and one in Tashkent—both intended to supply the 
needs of Asiatic Russia, which at present boasts of only one higher 
educational institution—the Tomsk university. 
Finally, the stand taken by the new authorities with regard to the 
question of higher education for women deserves explanation. 
Women students, debarred from the pursuit of studies in universities, 
had formerly to content themselves with so-called ‘‘Higher courses 
for women” instituted in many university centers. These courses, 
general and professional, compared favorably with the kind of edu- 
cation offered at universities, yet graduation from these institutions 
did not carry the same prestige as graduation from a Russian univer- 
sity. This fact led the ministry to draft a law which aims to trans- 
form the higher courses for women in Petrograd and Moscow into regu- 
lar universities for women. In addition to that, women may enter 
any higher educational institution on the same basis as men. 
Reports from Russia bring advices that are anything but favorable 
for the development of higher institutions. Owing to the revolu- 
tionary upheaval many university professors, known for their adher- 
ence to the old régime, were summarily dismissed from their posts; 
others handed in their own resignations; classrooms were deserted 
by students serving in the militia and various political organizations; 
and university buildings were utilized for the propagation of the new 
ideas. Add to this the need of professors felt in Russian universities 
long before the war; the lack of material required for the proper 
equipment of laboratories and clinics; the high cost of textbooks and 
various apparatus; and last, but not least, the general chaotic con- 
ditions of the whole country. Says the Novoye Vremya, under date 
of September 29, 1917: : 
Aseries of new universities is being opened in great haste. It is difficult at present 
to furnish new universities with indispensable textbooks and libraries, and there is 
no way pf securing professors. Long before the war the university chairs were only 
half filled. 
The Provisional Government is responsible for the changes in 
higher education which have been mentioned. Enlightened as these 
measures were, they did not, however, satisfy the Bolshevik leaders, 
who, as can be seen from the new university statute, seem to be 
anxious to throw the university doors open to all, regardless of 
attainments. The statute was prepared by a special commission,  
-P-A-G-E-381
EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. 381, 
consisting of Profs. Steinberg, Pokrovski, Artemyev, Fedorovski, 
Reussner, and Magirovski. 
THE NEW UNIVERSITY STATUTE.! 
1. The universities are divided into three free associations: (a) 
The fundamental, (6) the educational, and (c) the cultural. 
(a) The fundamental association aims to promote the theoretical 
work of its members in the field of learning. (b) The educational 
association is a higher school, which by means of instruction imparts . 
an all-round education in an entire field of knowledge or one of its 
special branches. It consists of permanent students, instructors, 
and professors. To the class of permanent students belong persons 
who have passed the midterm examinations. The instructors are 
chosen by the faculty for the duration of three years on tie basis of a 
competitive procedure. They must have an established reputation 
in the world of science or be known for their pedagogical activities. 
(c) The cultural association (university extension) will comprise a 
unit with the aim of informing the working people how to acquire 
knowledge in a concise and intelligible form; it will also prepare 
workers for the people’s universities, and furnish direct assistance to 
all cultural and educational agencies. The higher people’s schoo 
admit all persons above 16 years of age, with no distinction as to sex 
and nationality. 
2. The university must not be a class institution; hence, it must 
be free and admit all who seek higher education. 
3. The new statute excludes any possibility of turning the mem- 
bers of the university into a privileged class. For this reason there 
have been instituted temporary positions only, constant competi- 
tions for professors and instructors, compulsory lectures by profes- 
sors in public auditoriums, the assignment of professors to provincial 
universities. 
4, The number of chairs and faculties in each university is reserved 
to the decision of the university association. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
Technical education received considerable thought on the part of 
the prerevolutionary minister, Ignatyev, who saw in it a means ‘‘to 
make the world more comfortable.” His attention was mainly 
centered on the higher technical institutions which were to provide 
the State with trained experts for the promotion of the industrial 
development of the country. 
The Provisional Government, while realizing the importance of 
higher technical schools, was of the opinion that to attain the best   
1 Izv. Vser. Tzent. Kom. Sovietov, 1918, No. 94.
-P-A-G-E-382
  382 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
results a fundamental and radical change was imperative, and with 
that in view made sweeping changes in the field of elementary and 
secondary technical education. 
To begin with, it changed the section dealing with industrial schools. 
under the Ministry of Instruction,' into a department of professional 
education. 
It further issued a decree by which all professional institutions 
were to be divided, according to grades, into three groups: (1) Tech- 
_nical institutes (tekhnicheskiya uchilishcha); (2) trade institutes 
(remeslennyya uchilishcha); and (3) trade schools (remeslennyya. 
shkoly). 
The technical institutes, as stated in the new regulations, should 
aim at providing the students with a thorough knowledge, theo- 
retical and practical, in some special field of industry; the trade insti- 
tutes were to offer to students courses in applied sciences coupled 
with practical work, while the trade schools had as their aim the 
preparation of students to perform work in some special branch of 
industry in an intelligent and competent manner. 
The course of study in technical institutes was to cover four years,. 
in trade institutes not less than three years, while in trade schools. 
it was to vary according to the needs of the particular branch of 
industry. 
Admission to technical institutes, according to the decree, depends. 
on the completion of the course of higher elementary schools, to 
trade institutes of a two-class elementary school, while admission to a 
trade school requires only graduation from a one-class elementary 
school. The technical schools admit boys and girls. 
Degrees.—The completion of the course of a technical institute 
qualifies the student for the title of technician, which carries the 
right to execute work designed by an engineer, while graduation 
from a trade institute or a trade school leads to the title of master, 
or assistant master, respectively. Successful practice in his specialty 
for the period of not less than three years entitles the technician to a 
degree of engineer with the right to produce original work in his 
field. At the same time, under similar conditions, masters may 
become raised to the rank of master technicians, while assistant 
masters may become masters. These titles may be bestowed on the 
aspirants by the council of education of the respective schools, 
from which the students were graduated. 
In addition to the above-named graded schools, the Provisional 
Government made provision for the opening of various courses in 
special branches of industrial education.   
1 A number of technical schools lie outside the jurisdiction of the Minister of Instruction, but as changes 
in both kinds of schools do not differ materially they are treated here collectively,
-P-A-G-E-383
  EDUCATIONAL CHANGES IN RUSSIA. 383 
Courses, permanent or temporary, for teachers who could be used 
in the various technical schools were also planned by the educational 
authorities, 
By the same decree provision was also made to assign once in 
three years instructors of special branches to various factories and 
industrial plants with the view of putting them in touch with the 
latest developments in the industrial world. 
The cost of the technical schools and courses was to be defrayed 
by revenues from the treasury, the zemstvos, municipal, and other 
bodies. A considerable amount of money for scholarships was also 
assigned for students desirous of pursuing technical or industrial 
careers. To cover the expenses entailed by the reform act in 1917, 
the Government assigned for technical education an extra sum of 
one and a half million dollars in addition to the amount named for 
the same purpose by the pre-revolutionary authorities.' 
As an actual effect of the decree regarding technical schools in 
Russia it is interesting to note the opening in Moscow of the first 
technical institution of a new type with a four-year course. Com- 
menting upon this fact, the Vyestnik Vremennavo Pravitelstva, 1917, 
No. 92, adds: 
With the permission of the Minister of Public Instruction, and in accordance with 
the new law regarding technical institutions, there has recently been opened in Mos- 
cow the first technical institution which aims to give the student a theoretical and 
practical education indispensable for directing the work in architectural, engineering, 
hydrotechnical, mechanical, or electrotechnical lines. Graduates of the technical 
institutions will have the same rights as engineers in any of the above-mentioned 
specialties who have completed a course in technical institutions in Western Europe. 
In line with the reforms pertaining to technical education of the 
lower and intermediary grades is the progress made in 1917 in the 
field of higher technical education. Among the new institutions 
should be mentioned the establishment of two polytechnic institutes, 
one in Tiflis, Caucasus, and one in Nizhni-Novgorod, the former with 
agricultural, chemical, hydromechanical, and economic faculties, and 
the latter with chemical, mechanical, structural, and mining faculties. 
The establishment of the polytechnic institute in Nizhni-Novgorod 
is the result of the transfer of the Warsaw polytechnic institute, 
which at the beginning of the German occupation of Poland was 
moved farther east to the first-named city. The same political rea- 
sons that prompted the transfer of the Warsaw university also led to 
the transfer of the Warsaw polytechnic institute.’ In addition, plans 
were also made for the establishment of a new higher technical insti- 
tution in Tzaritzyn, an important city in the lower Volga region.   
1 Vyestnik Vr. Pr., 1917, No. 77. 
* Both the university and the polytechnic were reopened afterwards in Warsaw.
-P-A-G-E-384
  384 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Another proposal recommended by the new school authorities is 
the establishment of technical departments in connection with uni- 
versities. The advocates of this measure are of opinion that this 
arrangement will eliminate waste in the equipment of laboratories 
which may be used in common by students pursuing technical and 
purely scientific studies, and in avoiding duplication of professors. 
The newly projected universities, Irkutsk and Tashkent, which the 
Provisional Government was planning to open, were to have tech- 
nical divisions. Had this proposition been adopted Russia would 
have entered upon a scheme materially different from the one now 
in existence, by which university courses are divided into four 
groups—law, medicine, physico-mathematical sciences, history and 
philology. 
ADULT EDUCATION. 
Press reports from Russia show that the need of education has at 
no time been so poignantly felt by the masses as at present, when the 
old order of things has crumbled, when the whole nation has been 
drawn into the vortex of politics, and when the call for a new organi- 
zation of life has been sounded from every street corner and public 
platform. The people, anxious for the printed and spoken word, 
crowd the auditoriums and lecture halls and demand pamphlets and 
books from libraries, unfortunately poorly equipped with the very 
kind of literature that could throw light on the burning questions of 
the day. The dearth of popular literature, coupled with the lack of 
properly organized lectures, makes the ignorant masses an easy prey 
of agitators, who in their zeal to convert the people to their own 
political views sow doctrines that bring only chaos to the already 
muddled head of the Russian muzhik. Soon after the revolution in 
March, 1917, the school authorities, fully aware of the need of train- 
ing facilities for the adult population, took immediate steps toward 
its realization. 
One of the fruits of this decision was the calling of a conference in 
September, 1917, with the view of devising a program for the most 
advantageous expenditures of the State subsidies. This conference, 
presided over by the assistant minister, Countess Panin, long known 
for her activities among the working classes in Russia, recommended, 
among other things, the following course of action: 
The opening of primary schools (shkoly gramoty), where adults 
could learn to read and write, the opening of elementary schools with 
a general program, and the establishment of schools suited par- 
ticularly to the needs of the rural population. 
In addition, the conference advised the organization of courses for 
social workers in the various fields of adult education, as well as for the 
zemstvo leaders. It also emphasized the need of numerous special 
courses, such as agronomy, industrial and economic cooperation,
-P-A-G-E-385

bookkeeping, etc. Finally, the conference made a strong plea for the 
extension of the system of the public libraries, which it recommended 
should be supplied with proper literature suitable for the understand- 
ing of the masses. 
How far these proposed measures were accepted and to what extent 
they were put into practice by the proper school authorities is impos- 
sible to state because of the scarcity of news that could throw light 
on the situation. One thing is certain, however. The provisional 
authorities, as well as the succeeding Lenin-Trotaky régime, empha- 
sized the vital need of schools for adults in the general scheme of 
education. 
A. V. Lunacharski, the People’s Commissary of Public Instruction, 
thus pictures the situation in an address directed to the Russian 
people: . 
Everywhere in Russia, not only among the city workingmen, but also among the 
peasants, there has arisen a strong desire for education. Innumerable are the workers’ 
and soldiers’ organizations of that nature. To meet the demands of the mass of the 
people, to uplift them, and to clear the way for them are the first duties of a revolu- 
tionary and people’s government.” 
Apart from the Provisional Government’s intention to establish 
facilities for the education of the adults, it is interesting to note that 
the more intelligent circles of society tendered their help and took up 
the matter of providing special schools for that very purpose. So, for 
instance, in March, 1917, the municipality of Nizhni-Novgorod, one 
of the important cities of the Volga region with a large working popu- 
lation, assigned for a people’s university the sum of $50,000, while 
private contributions for the same purpose amounted to $400,000. 
Many other cities show a similar record in adult education,

I, INTRODUCTION. 
Though Spain maintained her neutrality throughout the World 
War, her educational, economic, and political conditions—in all 
countries inextricably bound up with each other—were affected 
nearly as much as those of the nations participating in it. In 
France, England, and Italy, educational reforms began early to press 
for recognition; and popular education came to be seen clearly as 
the supreme means upon whose efficient organization depended 
ultimately the salvation of national ideals in the perhaps even more 
trying period of adjustment after the war. Even Germany was 
constrained to seek ways of adapting the schools to such national 
service; and movements like the tentative Begabtenschule show the 
working of the leaven. In Spain, on the contrary, the dominant 
classes were plunged, almost over night, into enormous prosperity. 
The Spanish Government awoke to its opportunities, as was 
evidenced in many official acts. With the approaching expiration 
of the charter of the Bank of Spain, the minister of finance appointed 
. a commission to draft a new bill for the Cortes, setting forth a com- 
prehensive and far-reaching program, and calling for the purchase 
and operation of railroads by the state, and the development and 
utilization of all natural resources and waterpower. The minister of 
public works outlined unprecedentedly bold steps for a complete 
economic reconstruction of the Kingdom, involving a greatly en- 
larged sphere of activity and intervention by the state, based on an 
intensified economic survey of all national resources. The Associa- 
tion of Spanish Civil Engineers was granted by the Government the 
privilege of convening a congress in Madrid in the spring of 1919 for 
the purpose of discussing numerous phases of national development 
to which this profession can contribute. Among these are elementary 
and higher technical instruction, the organization of labor, sanitation 
and hygiene, and social questions relating thereto.

The advent of this material prosperity, however, has been accom- 
panied by results positively unfavorable to the spiritual and educa- 
tional life of the nation. It was a prosperity from its very nature 
unevenly distributed, being confined virtually to the great mining 
corporations of the mountainous Provinces, and to the shipping 
companies of the coast cities. The cost of the necessaries of life 
soared beyond all proportion to the wages and incomes of the great 
majority of the inhabitants of the Kingdom. The 25,000 or more 
teachers of Spain found existence increasingly difficult as the war 
went on. The increasing economic pressure lent a welcome excuse 
to the classes who are by tradition unfavorably disposed to popular 
education and constitute through the press and the Cortes! the 
vocal elements of the nation; they declared all attempts to enlarge 
the educational system out of the question in the face of such dire 
national stress. 
Against these well-organized forces, the schools and the teachers, 
uninfluential and poorly organized, could make no headway. The 
nation-wide desperation of the teachers began to be openly ex- 
pressed in their local, communal, and provincial assemblies early in 
1918, and was voiced in a corporate demand for increased salaries 
by the national association. Upon Don Santiago Alba’s acceptance 
of the ministry of public instruction in March, 1918, the movement 
received his cordial support, genuinely interested as he was in the 
improvement of the schools and the welfare of the teachers, There 
has been no national, and very slight local and communal, increase 
in the salaries of teachers since 1857, when the present school system 
was initiated. The average salary, of men and women, has always 
been less than $200. Sr. Alba planned systematic increase of 
salaries and far-reaching reorganization of the entire educational 
system. He contemplated the rapid training of an immediately 
available supply of primary teachers by sending a larger number for 
study abroad at one time than ever before. A system of libraries 
and intensive institute courses for teachers already in active work 
were also planned. 
Unfortunately for the success of his plans, Sr. Alba’s only nucleus 
of aid was found in the socialists, whose very support could but 
discredit his cause before the nation, inasmuch as they were held 
responsible for the serious strikes of 1917. Sr. Alba’s policies, calling 
for nearly five million dollars to be used for more and better schools, 
and especially for increasing the salary of all teachers to a minimum 
of $300 per annum, encountered powerful opposition from many 
quarters. 
  
1A minority of influential individuals and progressive newspapers constituted exceptions to this 
general statement.
-P-A-G-E-389
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 389 
Six months of factional struggle in the Spanish Cabinet ensued, 
centering around the activities of Sr. Alba, and culminated in the 
definite refusal of the majority to assent to his reforms, and in his 
resignation. Count Romanones, Minister of Justice, and formerly 
minister of public instruction, a man of liberal views, believed to be 
in sympathy with Sr. Alba’s main plans, and acceptable to the teach- 
ers of the Kingdom, was appointed in his stead. But the storm 
raised was fomented by the liberal element of the nation at large, 
and could not be laid by any half-way measures. The liberals 
continued, in every issue of a minority of influential journals, to set 
before the nation the elements that had compassed the downfall of 
the minister of public instruction. Early in November, 1918, the 
resignations of the entire Cabinet were called for, and Count Roma- 
nones was asked by the King to form a new ministry. It is true 
that other causes, international in character, were also operative in 
precipitating these events; but the significant fact remains that the 
position taken by a progressive minister of public instruction fur- 
nished the clearly marked line of cleavage leading to the resignation 
of a ministry originally selected for its personal strength and political 
experience.! 
The pressure of the demand for increased salaries was undiminished 
by the change of ministers. More successful than his predecessor, 
Count Romanones, just before he became premier, obtained the con- 
sent of the ministry to an increase of the salaries of primary teachers 
ranging from a maximum of $1,000 per annum to a minimum of 
$300. Subject as the decree was to serious modifications in actual 
practice, it yet constituted a signal proof of the power of public 
sentiment. The teachers, too, through their associations, not only 
bore an active part in the agitation for increased salaries, but they 
pressed for urgent reform on the administrative as well as on the 
purely instructional side of the schools. They repeatedly sub- 
mitted these reforms in recommendations to the minister, which will 
be discussed under their several heads. 
Il. NATIONAL PRIMARY EDUCATION, 
ILLITERAOY. 
In 1916 Spain had an estimated population of twenty and a half 
million. The figures for illiteracy are not tabulated for that year, 
but it may be safely assumed that they did not fall below that of the 
year 1910, when nearly twelve million people of all ages, a percentage 
of 59.35, were reported as unable to read and write. Indeed, with 
the continuous closing of primary schools in all parts of rural Spain   
1 For the suggestion of some of the “above lines of discussion acknowledgment is made to the very 
illuminating volume La Educacion Nacional by Don Cesar Silié y Cortés, Madrid, 1914, 
 
-P-A-G-E-390
  390 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
through lack of funds to attract teachers, it is possible that the illit- 
eracy for the latter year would surpass even the high figure given. 
The Provinces showing greatest illiteracy (estimated, 1916) are as 
follows: Almera, Malaga, Jaen, Albacete, Murcia, the Canaries, 
Ciudad, Real, Cordoba, Catillon y Alicente, all of which range above 
70 per cent. Those showing illiteracy ranging below 40 per cent are 
Segovia, Burgos, Palencia, Madrid, Alava ySantander. The decrease 
in illiteracy has been slow since 1860, when statistics were first gath- 
ered for the nation at large. In that year the percentage was 75.52; 
in 1877, 70.01; in 1887, 68.01; in 1900, 63.78. Spain’s leaders have 
never been slow to recognize the extreme seriousness of this menace; 
but beyond a few provisions in the national budget, and those of the 
most advanced communes for a supplementary fund for teachers 
holding night schools for adults—seldom rising for the individual 
above $50—nothing constructive has been attempted. Sr. Alba 
worked upon definite ideas along this line, but his brief tenure of 
office precluded the realization of his schemes. In 1916 throughout 
Spain 12,713 separate classes were conducted for the instruction of 
adult men and women. At a meeting of the National Assembly of 
Teachers held in Madrid in February, 1918, resolutions were passed, 
calling upon the Government to take vigorous measures for the sup- 
pression of illiteracy. It was recommended that the Government 
should: 
1. Not permit any man to vote who could not read or write. - 
2. Not issue an honorable discharge to the soldier who remained illiterate, 
8. See that the law be enforced forbidding the admission of a workman into an 
industry without a certificate of instruction. 
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The legal administration of the schools of Spain is under the 
supreme control of the minister of public instruction, an official 
created in 1900, appointed by the King, and sitting as a member of 
the royal Cabinet. He is charged with the duty of reporting to that 
body periodically the state of education throughout the Kingdom, 
with recommendations for its encouragement and improvement. In 
him is vested the appointment, to be approved by the King and Cabi- 
net, of all educational ‘officials, administrative and instructional. 
Taking up first the basic division of the system of public instruction, 
that of primary education, next under the minister of public 
instruction ranks the director of primary education (created in 1911), 
responsible to the minister and with special charge of the adminis- 
trative and inspectional sides of that branch of public instruction. 
Immediately subordinate to the director general are the provincial 
inspectors, named by the minister upon thé recommendation of the 
former, who are charged with the periodical visitation of the local
-P-A-G-E-391
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 391 
primary schools, the assembling and instruction of the local juntas in 
their duties and powers, and the submission of full and regular reports 
to the office of the director general. For the 49 Provinces, which 
embrace the 24,299 national primary schools, there are 171 inspectors 
and subinspectors. The number is three times that of 10 years ago. 
They rank in nine categories, according to length of service and salary. 
Upon their energy and the degree of fidelity with which they discharge 
their duties hinges vitally the well-being of the system. Responsible 
to the provincial inspectors, and required by law to cooperate with 
them, are the local juntas (committees). These are named by the 
ayuntamientos (boards) of the respective municipalities, and consist 
of the alcalde (mayor) ex officio and designated members, including 
one or more householders who are patrons of the primary schools. In 
the juntas are vested the powers of frequent visitation and general 
oversight of the local schools, their enrollment, physical, and social 
conditions. The juntas have no financial duties or powers whatsoever, 
all such, relative to the establishment or maintenance of the schools, 
remaining entirely in the hands of the ayuntamientos. Upon the 
periodical visitations of the provincial inspectors the juntas are 
required to assist them in every way in their inspection of the primary 
schools and to meet in conference and to formulate with them the 
needs of the schools. 
Despite this inspectional machinery, it is estimated that one-third 
of the schools of this grade go unvisited each year. Léon had 618 
schools unvisited in 1917, and many Provinces have as many as 100, 
200, or even 300 such schools. Sotne explanation may be found in 
the fact that for many zones the posts of inspectors have, for various 
reasons, been intermittently vacant. A brighter side of the picture, 
however, is presented in Cadiz, which leads with all the schools 
visited within the period of two years, in the Balearic Isles, and 
Valladolid, with all but a very few visited. Inspectors claim in their 
defense that they have been made responsible for zones besides their 
own, and that in many instances they can not secure reports as to 
location of actually existent schools. They complain of the indiffer- 
ence of secretaries of the aywntamientos in furnishing information 
that schools have been closed; and that, further, despite their 
activity in localities where the need of new schools is most urgent, 
and their clear outlining of the legal terms on which such localities 
may, in cooperation with the State, secure the needed schools, they 
are unable to arouse interest on the part of the local authorities. In 
brief, they maintain that the law for compulsory education of June 23, 
1909, is not enforced for the larger number of the municipalities, 
which neglect to draw up or revise the annual school registration 
reports. 
 
-P-A-G-E-392
  392 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
In January, 1918, a numerous committee of the National Associa- 
tion of Inspectors waited upon the minister of public instruction and 
the director general of primary education, and presented as the com- 
posite sense of that body, for enactment into law, a number of recom- 
mendations, the salient ones of which are here given: 
1. Both men and women inspectors should be required to remain 
net less than 8 or 10 days in the rural districts and villages of their 
zones, visiting and studying all the schools, and examining personally 
as many boys and girls as possible; upon this material they should 
present ample reports, to be published by the director general of 
primary education. In turn, the inspectors should be relieved as 
far as possible of clerical labor, and should be sent to provincial 
sections to establish personal relations with the local civil officials. 
2. General questionnaires should be drawn up and sent to all 
teachers of primary schools, inquiring as to changes and reforms 
deemed most urgent for the development of the schools. 
3. The Government should at once take up the construction of 
school buildings of modern and sanitary type, and on sites answering 
the legal requirements, and should at once take steps to improve the 
existing ones, borrowing money and issuing bonds on the national 
_credit. 
4. Every school building erected in villages of less than 1,000 
inhabitants should have annexed to it a teacher’s dwelling conforming 
to sanitary and architectural requirements. 
5. Every effort should be directed by school authorities, both 
municipal and national, to improve the school attendance, and to 
awaken educational interest by the incentives of school lunches, play- 
grounds, libraries, school loan funds, and all extra-scholastic activities 
possible. 
6. In agricultural and industrial communities, at least one full 
section of daily work in school should be required of all children over 
10 years of age whose labor is usually regarded as necessary for the 
aid of the father in the support of the family. 
7. All inspectors and local teachers should be required to take part 
in all activities of their respective spheres, studying and working for 
the development of all matters relating to education of the children, 
and the correction of juvenile delinquency. 
8. All matters relating to the visitation of private schools should be 
passed upon by the body of inspectors; and, unless otherwise agreed 
upon, the scope of such visits will be restricted to points of hygiene 
and ethics. 
9. In rural schools special importance should be attached to agri- 
cultural and horticultural teaching, and in those of mining and 
industrial centers to elementary technology and related sciences. 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 3893 
10. There should be established in provincial capitals special schools 
for adults, analogous to those projected for men, to give to women 
ample preparation for vocational work. 
11. Inspectors should have the power of intervening in all matters 
affecting the rights of teachers. 
12. Tenure of office for inspectors should be better safeguarded, 
inspectors being removable from office only by royal decree, and upon 
proven charges of incompetence or bad conduct. 
13. In every provincial capital there should be established a well- 
equipped permanent pedagogical museum and school exposition. 
PRESENT STATE OF THE NATIONAL PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The national primary schools of Spain are administered according 
to the territorial lines of the 49 Provinces of the Kingdom. They 
are taught by teachers who are paid wholly or in part out of the 
national treasury. In 1916 they included 7,409 one-room schools for 
boys and 7,075 for girls; 243 graded schools for boys, 158 for girls; 
8,935 mixed graded, and 479 for very young children, a total of 24,299 
national primary schools in the Kingdom. In 10 years, only 250 
new school buildings have been reported as erected in the entire 
country. In 1917, according to the statement of the late Deputy 
Giner de los Rios, member of the committee of the Cortes, appointed 
to investigate educational conditions, from 27,000 to 40,000 schools 
were lacking of the number contemplated even by the establishing 
law of 1857.1. Sr. Alba’s projected reforms included the establish- 
ment of 20,000 additional schools within eight months, with modern 
sanitation and equipment and the guarantee of the appointment of 
that number of men and women teachers within that period. 
The number of schools vacant for one or more years constitutes the 
most serious problem the educational authorities have to face? The 
suggestion has been made that the minister of public instruction be 
authorized by law to transfer from the State back to the commune 
all responsibility for such a school remaining vacant for three years. 
In the phase of primary education, naturally most efficient, that of 
the graded schools located in the centers of population, dissatisfaction 
is expressed by Spanish educational thinkers with the infrequency 
with which they are visited and the continued failure to secure reports 
  
1 This seems an overstatement in the light of the estimate by Count Romanones, then minister of public 
instruction, in his memoria for 1910. He put the number at 9,579 schools, 
The statement is made in La Escuela Moderna for September, 1917, that there were in that year 30,000 
towns and villages in Spain without schools and without teachers; that 3,000,000 children were, at one 
time, not in the schools; and that 10,000 men and women were needed in addition to those already in 
service, 
2 Even in the Province of Navarra, which, until November, 1918, had charge of its own public school 
system, an attempt to require all incoming teachers to take theschoolslongest vacant met with but doubtful 
success. The maximum salary of $200is not sufficient to attract new teachers.
-P-A-G-E-394
    394 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
on many of them. Persistent attempts have been made, both by 
local teachers’ associations and the press, to have all the royal decrees 
relating to them reduced to one section of the code. 
The clearest exposition of the condition and needs of the graded 
schools was made in the recommendations of the graded-school 
teachers’ division of the National Association at their meeting of 1917. 
The reforms then urged included greater care in the matter of the 
appointment of graded-school directors, less regard to political and 
personal influence, and participation by the teaching force in such 
appointment, sanctioned by the inspector; enlarged responsibility for 
the directors in the recommendations of the members of the teaching 
staff for appointment, including at least one supply teacher; the 
formulation of programs of study, exercises, and school excursions, in 
cooperation with the section teachers, to be transmitted to the 
regional delegate in the Cortes for presentation to the educational 
committee of that body. 
These recommendations bore fruit in the very progressive royal 
decree of September 19, 1918, the salient points of which are as 
follows: 
1. In graded schools instruction shall be given in the subjects determined for 
national schools by present legislation now in force. 
2. The local junta for the school, named according to law by the ayuntamiento, 
shall have wider latitude as to prescribing hours, division of classes, etc., and espe- 
cially in organizing school outings, excursions, etc. The director shall have wider 
and more definite duties, especially in visiting classes, and correspondingly more 
thorough and frequent reports to the inspector. 
8. The number of pupils enrolled in graded schools shall not exceed 50 for each 
section, except in cases of exigency, sparsity of population, or other valid reason 
agreed upon by the director and inspector. 
4, The director, advised by the teachers, shall lay before the local junta the physical 
needs of the schools as a whole and by grades, and all necessary equipment shall be 
provided at the expense of the State. 
5. All pupils admitted shall have completed the sixth year of their age, been vac- 
cinated, and be suffering from no contagious disease. All corporal punishment shall 
be forbidden. The State and the local junta combined shall furnish books and 
paper free, and in girls’ schools all equipment and material for household and domestic 
instruction free, the finished products to be the property of the school. All provisions 
shall be made for sanitation, light, and ventilation. 
6. The directors and teachers shall take part in all extra-scholastic activities of 
the school and community pertaining to the improvement of school conditions. 
School outings and excursions of a didactic nature shall be held at proper intervals, 
and the children shall be required to keep diaries and records of the same, examined 
and graded by teachers, samples of which shall be forwarded ultimately to the director 
general of primary education. 
7. Every graded school shall maintain a circulating library, a branch of the 
Mutual Loan Society, regularly organized according to law, school lunches, and 
facilities for dressmaking and tailoring. Anthropological measurements of each 
child shall be taken upon entering and leaving school. A committee of teachers shall, 
so far as possible, give motion pictures and lectures and hold conferences, local and 
district, and maintain international correspondence with teachers of other countries.  
-P-A-G-E-395
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 895 
8. Special provisions shall be made by the director and teaching force for the 
instruction of adults by lectures and special courses in mathematics, languages, 
drawing, and the rudiments of science, keeping always in view the needs, predominant 
industries, etc., of the locality. Qualified persons in the community shall be called 
upon by the director to confer with him informally at least once a month upon civic 
matters as related to the schools, especially those touching callings and industries 
into which pupils are most likely to enter. The duties and powers of the director of 
classes for adults shall be similar to those he possesses in the day schools. 
In these provisions, taken as a whole, is seen a uniform advance 
toward an efficient correlation of the administrative parts of the 
system; an enlarged social and civic activity by the teaching force, 
with articulation of primary education with community life; an 
enrichment of the content of the schools, and, inclusive of all these, 
a scientific attention to the physical and recreational upbuilding 
of the children. It is to be hoped that the financial provisions to 
make the decree effective will soon be made. 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
In 1916 the total number of schools privately founded or main- 
tained by private aid, assimilated to the national schools and subject 
to governmental supervision, was 6,367; the great majority are those 
founded, maintained, and taught by the religious orders. They 
enjoy almost entire freedom in courses and methods, the inspection 
of them required by law being usually restricted to their sanitation 
and training in ethics. Of private schools not under religious con- 
trol, conducted wholly or in part in English, French, or German, and 
intended primarily for children of foreigners, there were 116. The 
latter are naturally grouped in commercial and diplomatic centers 
and are largely patronized by the children of the noble and wealthy 
few, especially those not in sympathy with the new social and political 
order in Spain. 
Some of the schools founded by private benefactions and closely 
assimilated to the national primary schools are excellent and pro- 
gressive, the salaries paid being far above the average for the Gov- 
ernment schools and the buildings and equipment modern and 
sanitary. A sample of this type of school is the group entitled “La 
Colenia Garcia Diego,” situated in the city of Cordoba. It pays 
teachers $270 the first year and guarantees periodical increases of $25 
up to $500, with retirement at 65 years at $250 and a modern dwelling, 
Such teachers are also under express obligation to serve the ¢om- 
munity, being required to impart instruction to adults, men and 
women. 
Other private schools are above the average in progressiveness 
and efficiency. A number distinctively secular show the influence 
of Ferrer’s life and pedagogical teachings, which, exercised as they 
were in the city of Barcelona, in the 10 years preceding his execution
-P-A-G-E-396
    3896 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
in 1909, could not but have their influence. Especially in their prac- 
tice of coeducation as a preference, they have been imitated by the 
schools of republican and socialistic tinge.t 
Most noteworthy among the schools conducted avowedly under 
religious influences, but not by members of an order, are those 
commonly called, from the name of their organizer and teacher, a 
former barrister and student of social problems, the ‘‘Siurot System,” 
though their official title is ‘‘The Schools of the Sacred Heart.” 
They are located in the town of Huelva, in the Province of Andalusia, 
and enroll 1,000 boys. Maintained by private and voluntary sub- 
scriptions, they are housed in buildings of the plainest character, 
originally a seventeenth century convent; but sanitation, fresh air, 
and good food are regarded as essentials. They proceed entirely 
upon the theory of the predominant importance of the graphic method 
of instruction, with its appeal to the pupils’ imagination and interest. 
Mind and memory are cultivated and stimulated by the dramatic 
and skillful use of the pupils themselves as material. 
The cement-floored basement is marked off into squares, each 
pupil having his own allotment of space on which to reproduce 
material both from blackboard demonstration and of original de- 
sign. The application of the method to the several subjects taught is 
of interest. In geography the traditional start is made with the 
physical elements; the unique feature is the intensive and leisurely 
study of the large contour map of Spain, modeled in cement, Thor- 
ough familiarity with this is absolutely prerequisite to the pupil’s 
passing on to the large line map drawn upon the wall. The next step 
is to fit into the setting of coast, plain, hill, and mountain the centers 
of population, accompanied by the exposition of reasons for original 
settlement, and the local productions and industries. Then comes 
the study of political and civic divisions, with means of intercommu- 
nication. Historical connections are always woven in, often with- 
out the pupil’s realizing that he is learning anything outside of 
geography. The hour of examination upon the morning’s instruction, 
so far from being a dreaded burden, becomes by the aid of games a 
diversion. Each boy as he takes part calls out the name of some place, 
person, or event connected with the country selected, or if the 
method of debate is adopted, the detailed facts of instruction become 
vitalized by the personal interest and emotions of the pupil. Spanish 
history connects with geography by the use of the physical geography 
divisions already established. Pupils representing the succession 
of tribal and racial groups that entered Spain take positions agreed 
upon after preliminary study, and depict the resultant conflicts, 
fusions, readjustments, and ethical, governmental, and economic

results. Similarly, period after period of Spanish, medieval, and 
modern history is portrayed, involving the wider study of nations 
affected by contact with Spain and Spanish civilization. The claim 
is made for this unique method of historical instruction that it results 
in the desire on the part of the pupil to read all that can be secured 
outside the school bearing on historical events. In arithmetic the 
graphic method begins with homely proverbs, such as Cada oveja 
con su pareja (Birds of a feather flock together), and applies the prin- 
ciple of likeness to the four basic processes of this subject. Thence 
the pupils proceed to play at being units, tens, dividends, quotients, 
etc., applying the same methods of visualization on through the more 
complex stages into geometry and algebra. 
The results on the sides of morals and behavior accruing from the 
training in these schools-are reported as being even more noteworthy 
than those on the mental side. Accounts of the condition of the 
prospective pupils at the time of the inauguration of these schools 
represented them as at a low stage, which, indeed, culminated in 
such scenes as to cause Sr. Siurot himself, then an advocate in good 
practice, to abandon his profession and devote himself to so vital a 
task as the reclamation of these future citizens of Spain. 
These schools early attracted the favorable notice of the minister 
of public instruction, and, encouraged by English visitors, accommo- 
dations have been provided for the training of 30 teachers in this 
method. International educational arrangements with France and 
England are contemplated whereby this system may be studied and 
its practical features carried as ‘‘an educational evangel to other 
countries.” 
ENROLLMEMT IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The total enrollment in the national primary schools for 1916 was 
estimated at 1,712,261, and the average attendance at approximately 
1,133,557, a percentage of 67. This enrollment of less than one and 
three-fourths millions on an estimated general population of twenty 
millions is disproportionately low. The absence of a provision in the 
school law definitely fixing the compulsory school age renders any 
treatment of this subject unsatisfactory. The total enrollment in 
the private primary schools of all kinds is estimated at 300,000. No 
figures are available for attendance, but it is fair to assume that the 
percentage is higher than for the national schools, because of the 
greater interest of their patrons, as evidenced, among other things, by 
willingness to pay fees for instruction. 
The discrepancy between the enrollment and the attendance 
figures in the national primary schools may, in some degree, be 
explained for the capital cities of the most populous Provinces by 
the existence of the private schools above mentioned. The city of
-P-A-G-E-398
  898 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Barcelona may perhaps be taken as a fair example of this situation. 
In this city a unique legal arrangement exists whereby private 
schools are subsidized by the ayuntamientos but not counted as 
belonging to the public-school system. On the city’s estimated 
school population of 82,000, only 16,000 children are enrolled in the 
national schools of all kinds. The attendance on private schools of 
all kinds was estimated at 50,000. This leaves 16,000 children of 
school age still unaccounted for, and in the most progressive city of 
the Kingdom.- Speaking for the Kingdom at large, it is estimated 
that a total of from two to three million children of school age receive 
no instruction whatsoever. 
Nonattendance, or poor attendance, of children enrolled in the 
rural primary schools is assumed by all the educational writers of 
Spain. Teachers complain of the unwarrantable extension by the 
school administrators of the radii of school districts. Others empha- 
size the almost insuperable difficulties country children have in 
reaching schools and the disastrous physical effects upon them of 
the lack of school lunches and facilities for drying clothes and shoes. 
They blame the rotation of farm work for the recurrent periods of 
absence and indifference and the call of the industrial centers for 
children workers from the tenderest years. 
The local ayuntamientos, also, with whom rests all financial respon- 
sibility for the schools, are blamed by teachers and inspectors for 
neglect of manifest duties as regards both the selection of school 
sites and the upkeep of the schools after they are established. 
COST OF NATIONAL PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
The total‘amount expended by the Government upon national 
primary education in 1917 was $6,894,235, a slight decrease from 
that for 1916 but an increase of 334 per cent since 1902. On the 
basis of a population estimated in 1917 at 20,875,844, this was an 
expenditure of 34 cents per capita, or for each child of school age, 
$4.282 
By the law of 1902 local aywntamientos were empowered to appro- 
priate annually from local taxes additional funds for the maintenance 
of necessary assistant teachers and for the upkeep of the schools, the 
same to be applied for by the juntas and approved by the provincial 
inspectors. Statistics are not available as to the extent to which 
the ayuntamientos have availed themselves of this law.   
1 Silio y Cortés, in the chapter La Escuela Publica. 
2Tt should be borne in mind, however, that this calculation takes account only of the few more than one 
and one-half million children enrolled, and not of the even larger number who, it is claimed, should be 
enrolled but are not.
-P-A-G-E-399
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 899 
SANITATION AND HEALTH OF SCHOOLS. 
In all Provinces schools of insanitary conditions are reported. 
Those of the Balearic Isles make the best showing; those of Barce- 
lona, both city and Province, the worst, with more than 640 reported 
in bad condition. In the city of Madrid there are 59 municipal 
schools combining conditions both unhygienic and unpedagogical, 
and the Province of Madrid has 256 such schools. It is difficult to 
fix responsibility for the physical condition of school buildings, 
because comparatively few of the latter are owned by the State. In 
10 Provinces no school buildings are reported as owned by the State, 
and most Provinces report only very few. Accurate statistics are 
not available. The estimate is based upon informal reports of 
teachers that at least 15,000 schools in Spain constitute a menace 
to the health and life of the children attending them. 
There is scarcely a Province in which the children of all of the 
schools are vaccinated. The record is unsatisfactory throughout 
the Kingdom. Even the city of Madrid has five schools in which 
few, if any, of the children have been vaccinated. There are, how- 
ever, legal and municipal regulations requiring vaccination. 
By royal decree of December 21, 1917, school medical inspection 
was established in Madrid and Barcelona, and an institute of school 
hygiene was founded at Madrid. This is to be directed by a council 
of which the director general of primary education shall be chairman. 
It is composed of the inspector general of the medico-scholastic divi- 
sion, of the secretary of the institute, and of members chosen from 
teachers of upper normal schools, the faculties of medicine and phar- 
macy, the Academies of Medicine and Natural Sciences, and the 
Higher School of Architecture. Upon the publication of the decree, 
the institute was required to organize the following courses: Pae- 
dology; care of children; school hygiene; anthropology and physi- 
ology of the abnormal; digestive system of children. Only 30 
attendants upon each course were to be accepted. If there should be 
more applicants the preference would be given physicians and prin- ° 
cipals of schools. Reports from the individual instructors were to be 
required; and these, collected by the director general for a number 
of years, were to constitute a valuable aid to hygienic progress in 
Spain. This composite report is to be transmitted every year to the 
minister of public instruction. The institute is to cooperate in every 
way with teachers and municipalities. The institute will also be 
further charged with the organizing of meetings and conferences of a 
scientific and popular character, in order to diffuse a knowledge of 
the fundamental principles of hygiene among the general public. 
The law of September, 1913, requiring the competitive selection of 
medical and dental officers for inspection of national schools in 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  400 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Madrid had ceased to be executed. It was revived by the public- 
spirited physicians of Madrid, who in September, 1917, waited upon 
the minister of public instruction with the request that he enforce it. 
The apparent partiality shown Madrid, however, aroused the execu- 
tive committee of the National Association of Teachers to protest 
against the spending of considerable sums in inspection which had 
much better be used in preventing diseases by providing fit school 
sites and buildings of a hygienic and pedagogical character, and 
paying teachers salaries enabling them to live in comfort and self- 
respect. 
The seventh annual award of prizes was announced in 1917 by the 
executive committee of the Spanish association for the protection of 
infancy and the suppression of mendicancy, for the best work along 
the following lines: 
Five prizes of 280 pesetas each to rural physicians distinguished for 
work in behalf of mothers and children; ten of 200 pesetas each for 
teachers of rural schools or private teachers distinguished for social 
and protective work; five of 200 pesetas each and a certificate for the 
author of the best unpublished monograph on the popularization of 
schools; a prize of 500 pesetas for the author of 12 drawings in.color 
best illustrating a historical anecdote or short narrative, in prose or 
in poetry, for the instruction or recreation of children. 
MINIMUM CURRICULUM OF NATIONAL PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The minimum curriculum prescribed by law for the national 
primary schools is as follows: 
1. Christian doctrine and sacred history. 
. Spanish, reading, writing, composition, and grammar, 
. Arithmetic, geometry, and drawing. 
. Geography, history of Spain, elements of national law. 
. Elements of physical and natural sciences, physiology, hygiene, agriculture. oR 8 to 
In the schools of Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago, and Malaga, singing, 
manual arts, and physical training are also compulsory. 
These subjects are divided into two grades, elementary and higher, 
of three and five years, respectively. 
There is, of course, wide diversity in the methods and the extent 
to which the five nationally prescribed subjects are taught. In some 
Provinces, and in districts of certain Provinces, the law is indif- 
ferently executed. According to the report for 1916-17 of the 
director general of primary education, 35 Provinces have no religious 
instruction maintained at the expense of the State. On the con- 
trary, Navarra has 46 teachers of religion, Barcelona 14, and Madrid 
22, paid in whole or in part from the national treasury.
-P-A-G-E-401
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 401 
EXTRA-SCHOLASTIO ACTIVITIES. 
As has been seen, a provision of one of the royal decrees of 1918 
prescribed periodical outings or school excursions for every national 
school in the Kingdom, requiring that they be conducted under the 
supervision of the teacher, or, in the case of a graded school, of the 
director, and that each pupil prepare a diary or formal account of the 
same, to be submitted to the teacher, and, if of merit, to be forwarded 
to the inspector, and by him to the director general of primary educa- 
tion. Akin is the revival of the decree of the Queen Regent (1892) 
establishing ‘‘La Fiesta de la Raza,” the celebration by the schools 
of October 12, the anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of the New 
World under Spanish auspices, observed by many of the Spanish 
American countries, whose purpose is to keep alive the remembrance 
of racial and filial ties. Latitude is also given the individual teacher 
and director to hold local holidays of a religious and patriotic nature. 
A decided movement for the establishment of open-air schools in 
many of the centers has been perceptible. Madrid has several of 
these, encouraged by the educational and civic authorities, though 
as yet in the experimental stage. One is noteworthy as embracing six 
grades, enrolling 216 pupils, and providing midday lunches, gym- 
nastics, and playground facilities. 
The school lunch room has been instituted in a few of the larger 
cities! and in scattering Provinces. Brgnches of the society as 
established by law are annexed to the schools of most of the cities 
and the more progressive Provinces. 
The system of circulating libraries under the director general of 
primary education was established in 1912 by royal decree, intended 
primarily for teachers and pupils of the primary schools. Fifty 
libraries, 48 in the Provinces and 2 in Madrid, compose the system. 
Each consignment of books coming to the schools of a Province in 
succession is under the direct management of the primary teacher in 
charge of the school. 
In September, 1918, was held at Monrisa perhaps the first exhibi- 
tion of school work in Spain done by individual teachers and groups 
of pupils of the national primary schools of the Province. It con- 
sisted of designs and executions of manual arts, free-hand drawings, 
maps, geometric designs, weaving, and embroidery. It was visited 
by large numbers of people of all classes, and evoked enthusiastic 
interest.   
1 The first system of school lunches in Spain was initiated in Madrid in 1902, with two in operation fur- 
nishing 9,000 meals for the school year; in 1906, six furnished 150,000 meals; in 1911, cleyen furnished 160,000 
meals.

    402 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
TEACHERS, SALARIES, AND PENSIONS. 
In 1916 the national primary schools of Spain were taught by 
13,034 men and 11,755 women, showing a larger number of men than 
women engaged in primary teaching. In the non-national primary 
schools, of a private and voluntary nature, a total of 8,124 men and 
women were teachers. 
In any serious study of the teachers of a system, next in importance 
to the consideration of qualifications comes that of salaries. This 
has been touched upon in the introduction. The inequalities of the 
present scale of salaries are shown by the fact that less than 600 
teachers receive from $700 to $2,300; 6,700 teachers receive from $220 
to $300; 14,423 teachers receive $220 and less. 
An agreement was reached in October, 1918, by the ministry headed 
by Count Romanones, which fixed the maximum salary for teachers 
in primary education at $1,000, and the minimum at $300. The 
important exception, however, was made that nearly half the salaries 
of primary teachers should be left at $250, inasmuch as this class is 
limited in their rights to promotion by the organic law of public in- 
struction. Even this is encouraging when it is recalled that the great 
majority of this class have hitherto received only about $125. The 
new salary scale applies to men and women without discrimination, 
and is as follows: 
50 teachers receive $1,000. 
100 teachers receive $900. 
150 teachers receive $800, 
300 teachers receive $700. 
600 teachers receive $600. 
1,500 teachers receive $500. . 
8,000 teachers receive $400. 
9,000 teachers receive $300. 
  The remaining teachers, approximately 10,000 in number, receive 
$250. Provisions are appended by which many teachers secure addi- 
tional fees by extra teaching in adult classes, and still others may 
obtain admission to the $300 class by passing examinations for pro- 
motion. 
Akin to the matter of salaries is, of course, that of retirement age 
and pension. The activities of local branches of the National 
Teachers’ Association and Sr. Alba’s progressive labors bore fruit in 
the royal decree of May 2, 1918, by which the retiring age of Spanish 
teachers was fixed at 70 years; the pension fund was nationalized; 
the assessment on each teacher’s salary for the national fund was re- 
duced from 10 to 6 per cent per annum. From January 1, 1919, re- 
tired teachers are to enjoy a pension equivalent to two-thirds of the 
maximum salary received for two consecutive years; widows and
-P-A-G-E-403
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 4038 
minor orphans are to receive two-thirds of what the deceased relative 
would have received. 
In the matter of the professional training of primary teachers, 
Spain has made creditable progress within the past few years, thanks 
to the activities of the normal schools. As related to them, the sub- 
ject will be resumed later. Taking into account the many obstacles 
confronting it, the primary school system of Spain shows gratifyingly 
few teachers without professional training of some kind. True, in 
the case of the older teachers who antedate the present normal schools, 
this training is very slight, and no claim is made that it is abreast. 
of modern demands; but the fact remains that decidedly less than 
a thousand teachers at present wholly lack professional training. 
The Province of Leon with 160 untrained teachers has most; eight 
Provinces show fewer than 30 each. In eight others all teachers re- 
ceiving salaries out of the national treasury are trained and hold cer- 
tificates. 
  NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
The royal decree of 1902 reorganized the normal school system, 
putting it under the control of the minister of public instruction and 
the director general of primary education, and outlining the follow- 
ing types: (a) Two central normal schools in Madrid, one for each sex, 
requiring for entrance, that the student shall have reached the age 
of 18 years and have passed satisfactory examinations upon the 
subjects embraced in the courses required in the provincial normal 
schools. The aim of these central normals is to prepare teachers for 
normal schools and for directors of graded schools. A normal aca- 
demic course of a year as provided includes religious instruction, 
ethics, church history, anthropology, and elements of pedagogy, social 
economy and school legislation, Spanish literature, English, or Ger- 
man. The regular course covers two years and embraces the fol- 
lowing subjects: Spanish and universal literature, religion and ethics, 
sacred, Spanish, and universal history, advanced geography, Spanish 
and general, physics, chemistry, physiology and hygiene, elements of 
general law, school legislation, French or English, penmanship, manual 
arts, gymnastics, drawing, and singing. For women, household arts 
and expression are substituted for manual arts. Observation of 
methods of teaching in the annexed practice schools is required every 
year, and intensive study and practice of teaching the last year. 
(6) District higher normal schools, one in each university dis- 
trict, requiring students, if men, to have reached the age of 18 years, 
if women, that of 17 years, and to have passed satisfactory exami- 
nations upon the subjects required in the courses of the elementary 
normal schools. The aim of these district normal schools is the same 
as that for the central normal schools. The course covers three years, 
 
-P-A-G-E-404
404 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
and includes the following subjects: Elements of the physico-natural 
sciences, mathematics, geography, history, Spanish, pedagogy, 
French, ethics, religious instruction, manual arts, singing, and draw- 
ing. In the normal schools for women, music and household economy 
are added. 
(c) Elementary normal schools, numbering at least one for each sex 
in each Province, requiring for entrance that the student shall have 
completed the sixteenth year of his age, or be exempted by the direc- 
tor of the normal, completed the subjects offered in the schools of 
primary education, and passed the following examinations: 
1. The preparation of a paper or document upon a subject assigned 
by the examining board; an exercise in writing from dictation; the 
solution of a problem in arithmetic. 
2. The reading aloud of a selection of prose or poetry, giving a 
summary of the sense. 
3. Correctly answering questions upon Christian doctrine, sacred 
history, Spanish grammar, and arithmetic. 
The aim of the provincial elementary normal schools is to prepare 
‘teachers for schools of primary education, one-room, graded, and 
mixed. The subjects are embraced in a two or three years’ course, 
and are as follows: Christian doctrine and sacred history, penman- 
ship, physics and chemistry, natural history, and manual arts, 
physiology, hygiene and gymnastics (for women, domestic arts), peda- 
gogy and practice teaching, with rudiments of school law. In view 
of the urgent demand for teachers in primary education, these courses 
are so arranged as to allow some students to complete certain of 
them in January and others in June; and some to enter in February 
and others in September. The 43 elementary normal schools for 
men enrolled in 1916 a total of 8,158, of whom nearly 2,000 were 
admitted to teach; the 49 for women enrolled 10,531, of whom about 
the same number as for men were admitted to teach. 
The efficiency of the normal school in Spain is higher than that 
of any other division of the educational system. For this, credit 
belongs largely to former Minister Bergamin, to whose changes and 
reforms in 1915 the present form is due. In spite of the criticism 
launched at his policies at the time, especially on the score of making 
religious instruction compulsory, giving the naming of teachers of 
religion to the bishop of the respective diocese, and separating the 
sexes, the normal structure of Sr. Bergamin has commended itself 
in actual practice. His ideas marked an advance in giving solid 
content to the training of teachers, in continuity of studies, in fos- 
tering scientific study, and in contributing to the molding of teachers 
who should in their turn mold in the primary schools religious and 
patriotic citizens.
-P-A-G-E-405
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 405 
Dissatisfaction has, however, long been felt by the progressive 
teachers and press of Spain with the normal schools; and this found 
expression in recommendations drawn up by the Association of 
Teachers of Normal Schools, at their meeting in Madrid in July, 1918, 
and presented for the consideration of the minister of public educa- 
tion. Their salient points were as follows: 
1. The establishment in elementary normal schools of a five-year 
course, the first four years of which are to be of a general and cultural 
nature, and the fifth devoted to practical training in pedagogy. 
2. The establishment of technical and middle schools with three 
grades for both sexes in order that pupils at the age of about 12 
years may, on emerging from the primary schools, have the way 
plain to them to continue until the age suitable for entering normals 
or vocational and professional preparatory schools. Such schools 
already exist in Spain in preparation for schools of arts, trades, in- 
dustries, and business; none have been provided for normal prepa- 
ration. 
3. The establishment of annexed practice schools, consisting of 
eight grades, six for regular primary work, one for review work, and 
the last for special training of retarded and abnormal children. 
4. Thorough scientific training of teacher-pupils by means of prac- 
tical exercise in teaching. 
5. The establishment of more and better paying scholarships, and 
subvention of traveling scholarships. 
6. The fixing of a new scale of salaries for teachers in normal 
schools, both men and women, with an increase of $100 every year 
for 5 years, the initial salary to be fixed at $500. 
7. The taking over by the State of the buildings and equipment 
of all normal schools. 
8. As the cardinal administrative reform, the designation of the 
director of each normal school by vote of its teachers, the submission 
of his name for the approval of the minister, and his confirmation 
for a term not longer than four years. 
In accordance with these recommendations, a royal decree em- 
powered the minister of public instruction to issue questionnaires to 
the faculty of every normal school in Spain, calling for answers to 
queries upon the following points, each department of related studies 
to deal with the questions concerning it: The number of normals 
necessary as based on the number, general training, educational 
preparation, and attitude of pupils toward the profession of teaching; 
size, number, condition, etc., of grounds and buildings; school equip- 
ment, scientific and pedagogical; library facilities; pedagogical 
exhibits and museums; relation of the individual normal school to 
others, to centers of education, and to provincial inspectors; annexed 
practice school; entrance requirements; plan of studies, how far 
 
-P-A-G-E-406
  406 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
realized and pupils’ attitude toward it; length of course; schedule 
and hour scheme; school dormitories and residences for teachers; 
good or bad results to the system from the instruction of pupils not 
pledged to teach. 
By royal decree of 1918 there was founded at Madrid an Institution 
of Secondary Teaching, under the direction and inspection of the 
Commission for the Advancement of Studies and Scientific Research. 
By its provisions, lodging will be supplied all pupils. Conditions of 
entrance are to be set by the minister of public instruction, The 
course shall cover not less than six years, when fully developed, and 
shallhave a preparatory department. The subjects studied shall be at 
least those embraced in the programs of secondary instruction. To 
be admitted to the school as a candidate for post as teacher, the 
student must be a Spaniard, be over 17 years of age, and have pur- 
sued, or be pursuing, university courses. The training of students 
shall combine three main lines of training: (1) University studies, (2) 
practical teaching in primary schools, (3) reading, criticism, personal 
and experimental work in the pedagogical seminary, studies and 
practice in foreign educational centers. 
The suggestion is probably drawn from South America, where it 
was worked out first in Chile, and then in Argentina. 
The establishment of supplementary courses for teachers in 
Oviedo, by royal decree of June, 1918, is also to be noted as the first 
of its type in Spain. The junta of the pedagogical conference at 
Oviedo had petitioned for this, and the rector’s council of the uni- 
versity had favorably reported upon it. It was to be under the direc- 
tor general of primary education, and for men and women teachers 
of national schools, and to embrace fundamental training in educa- 
tional problems, reading of pedagogical books, methodology and 
school organization, conferences on all phases of education, elements 
of physical and natural sciences, agriculture and industry, social 
problems and excursions. It was to be held in October and to last 
15 days. One man and one woman were to be selected from each 
judicial district of the Province by the inspector of the district. 
Living and traveling expenses were to be paid. 
SUMMARY: PROJECTED REFORMS. 
Spain’s patriotic educational leaders sincerely deprecate the popu- 
lar idea that a panacea is to be found in expecting the State to initiate 
the necessary reforms. In marked contrast, for example, are the 
Scandinavian countries and England, where, as shown in the history 
of the Fisher bill, all desire of reform and all effective initiative is 
born of localized units of government and communal life, and associa- 
tions of diverse kinds, private societies, etc. In all those countries 
.
-P-A-G-E-407
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 407 
the State only gathers up the movement already initiated, fosters it, 
and diffuses it. As has been seen, a marked and powerful industrial 
revival has shown itself in Spain within the past four years. Friends 
of popular education unite in urging that advantage be taken of this 
by every agency to further education of all kinds. The perplexing 
problems of training in apprenticeship, and those of the technical 
and vocational education of the masses, should at once be taken up 
by local agencies and pressed upon the Government, without waiting 
for the latter to move. 
Among the summaries of the urgent need of educational reform, 
and the deplorable results to Spain’s national life from her indifference 
to hygiene in particular, perhaps the most forceful was uttered by 
Don Alejandro Rossello in the Cortes in May, 1918. Speaking to the 
report of the Commission on Education, he said: 
The steady impoverishment of Spain is due in great part to the total lack of attention 
to hygiene. Two hundred thousand lives are lost annually that could have been 
saved, representing on a conservative estimate 300,000,000 pesetas ($60,000,000). 
Sickness and loss of time from work represent 200,000,000 pesetas in addition. Educa- 
tional authorities may no longer close their eyes to this frightful drain on the national 
resources, for on it hinges ultimately the welfare, even the existence, of the nation. 
The smaller nations are already in great danger; if the minister of public instruction 
has the power to protect existing industries and encourage others, surely he has the 
right, a priori, to encourage and safeguard health, the matter of the most vital impor- 
tance. The number of recruits rejected by the army because of deficiency in weight 
and height, as reported by medical officers, and the mortality among the civil popula- 
tion, are appalling. To provide more and better food, and radically improved sanita- 
tion, is the plain duty of the Government; and to the Government’s chief agent, the 
minister of public instruction, the nation looks for immediate and vigorous action. 
What could be more tragically absurd than that the Government should have the power 
to take over the nutrition and education of the youth while under arms, and yet 
take no heed whatsoever of it during the formative years and conditions preceding 
military age? ; 
This leads inevitably to the entire question of physical education, of which there 
is total lack in many lines of instruction. Most important of these are the manual 
arts. These constitute the basis of all apprenticeship schools, of all arts and trades 
schools, of all polytechnic schools. * * * The aim of such schools should not be 
confined to the development of mere manual dexterity. The development of the 
brain is in close relation with that of the hand. There is furthermore a fundamentally 
ethical meaning, inasmuch as a just emphasis put upon labor does away with arti- 
ficial social categories. * * * Spain has before this had gleams of her duty. 
Twenty-five years ago she sent investigators to the far-famed school of manual arts 
in Naas, in Sweden; they returned, arrangements were made for the systematic 
instruction of Spanish teachers for national schools and normals, but the movement 
was allowed to die, and nothing came of it. The same was true of the sending of pupil 
teachers to the well-known Italian school at Ripatranssone. * * * 
So with school and national games, Spain does not know how to play. School 
games, school grounds fostered by the nation, do not exist. Even the word is be- 
coming unknown, the good old Spanish word horuelo. The playground of a genera- 
tion ago should be restored; old national ones should be restored, and new ones should 
be introduced from other countries. This is of interest primarily to the working class, 
first because health is their capital, economically speaking, and secondly, as part 
 
-P-A-G-E-408
  408 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
of the nation they have the duty and right to share in a complete and well-rounded 
education. 
The development of primary schools immediately needed is that which enhances 
manual dexterity as an educational element, viz, the schools for apprentices. In 
Spain these are as yet only on paper; but they must at once be organized, as must the 
schools of arts, industries, and trades, and all kindred schools. The practical work 
of the shop must be stressed. And yet the teacher must not be merely a mechanic. 
Spaniards may never again, for historical reasons, be a world-governing race like 
the English; but they can for the self-same reasons, be a directing race in matters of 
the mind. France, evenin time of war, set herself to the making over of her apprentice 
schools; and England is discussing them as one of the chief features of her pending 
education bill.! . 
But it is still by means of the primary schools that the minister of public instruction 
must touch and mold the people. The Crown is already alive to the imperative 
necessity of constructing none but hygienic schools. If a start can be made here, 
it will be some offset to the appalling mortality from tuberculosis. The location of 
the school building is of supreme importance. A start should be made in the towns 
and villages which are to build schoolhouses by the appointment of a local provisional 
council to select fitting sites at fair prices, and to dedicate them to the school and to 
playgrounds and plats for garden and agricultural experiments by the pupils. Pri- 
mary instruction must be radically overhauled and changed, and so of course must 
the form of teaching back of and beneath it, namely, the training of the teachers of 
the primary schools. We run the risk, more than all other countries, of useful men 
being attracted from teaching into the trades and better paid employments. The 
teachers’ salary must be increased until it is fair, and will bear comparison with the 
pay of other skilled men and women. * * * The teachers should, if possible, 
have university training, or at least a part of it. They should be encouraged to go 
to the universities, and the universities should be required to institute a faculty of 
pedagogy as leaven to the lump; all teachers should attend such courses, especially 
those aspiring to be professors in institutes or in normal schools of four grades, inspec- 
tors, and principals of normals. The normal schools should specialize in preparing 
technically all pupil teachers by constant and unceasing practice in teaching from the 
first to the last day of their training. 
Ill, SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
INSTITUTOS GENERAL AND COLEJIOS. 
Secondary education in Spain is organized along the territorial 
lines of the 11 university districts. The local administrative side is 
controlled by a rector for each university district, who is appointed 
by the Crown on the recommendation of the minister of public 
instruction, and is generally the rector of the university of that 
district. Cooperating with the rector is the provincial junta, of 
which he is a member, together with the civil governor of the Prov- 
ince, an ecclesiastic delegated by the diocesan bishop, a member of 
the normal provincial commission, a member of the ayuntamiento 
of the provincial capital, a judge of the provincial courts, the in- 
spector of primary education, the director of the provincial instituto, 
and three patrons of the provincial instituto named by the minister. 
(Law of 1875.) Three inspectors general are required to visit peri- 
odically all institutos and to present reports to the minister for 
  
1 This speech was delivered before the passage of the education act, August, 1918.
-P-A-G-E-409
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 409 
transmission to the cabinet. In accordance with the legal require- 
ment, there is in each Province at least one instituto of secondary 
education for boys which confers the bachelor’s degree. Of these 
there are 58, including both general, that is, traditionally classical, 
and technical. 
To be admitted to the studies of the instituto the student must be at 
least 9 years of age, and pass the prescribed examination, both 
theoretical and practical, in all subjects included in the course of 
the national primary education, before the examining board appointed 
by the minister. Examinations on the theoretical side must be 
individual; those on the practical side may be by groups, each stu- 
dent being required to write at dictation a simple grammatical para- 
graph, and to solve in writing simple problems illustrating the four 
fundamental rules of arithmetic. 
The subjects taught in the cultural institutos cover a six-years 
course, and are as follows: Spanish, grammar, rhetoric, and litera- 
ture; Latin and Greek; French and English or German; history, 
general and Spanish; geography, physical and political ; cosmography, 
mathematics, natural history, physiology and hygiene. 
The technical and commercial institutos omit Latin and Greek, 
and require physical sciences, accounting and bookkeeping, com- 
mercial geography, and two modern languages in their place. 
By royal decree there must be for each instituto at least the fol- 
lowing teachers: Five for the section of languages and literature; 
four for the section of sciences; three for the section of religious in- 
struction, drawing, and gymnastics; and two assistants for each full 
section. Salaries are, of course, higher than in primary education; 
but no statistics on this point are available. Students completing the 
full six years’ course of the classical instituto receive the bachelor’s 
degree, and upon examination are admitted at not earlier than 15 
years of age to the universities. 
Preparatory to the cultural institutos are the annexed schools 
called the colegios, of which there are 253. In 1916 a total of 48,311 
students, of whom 1,936 were girls, were admitted to both these types 
of secondary schools. For 1916 the cost of maintenance of the system 
of secondary education was a little over $1,100,000, an increase of 48 
per cent since 1902. 
At a meeting of the teachers of institutos held in June, 1918, re- 
form in the subjects taught was urged, in order that the traditional 
course might not be merely instructional, but educative as well. A 
clear division of the courses into the cultural and the scientific was 
also urged, with the creation of additional institutos in the populous 
centers. Enlargement of the teaching staff was advocated, with 
teachers specially trained for their subjects. Lengthening of the 
traditional six-year course to eight years was also advocated, by
-P-A-G-E-410
    410 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
means of the development of the courses in Spanish, science, and 
modern languages, and the addition of others in civic and sociolog- 
ical fields, in order to keep the pupil in school until greater maturity, 
and for the attainment of a riper and more solid culture, essential to 
the ability to determine special vocation and to the formation of 
character and personality. A 50 per cent decrease of expense for 
students in secondary education was also urged, and an increase of 
scholarship funds for residence of students in provincial capitals. 
Of the special institutos (ensefianza técnica) dependent upon the 
ministry of public instruction, the following are most noteworthy: 
1. Schoots of veterinary surgery, at Madrid, Cordoba, Leon, Santiago, and Zaragoza, 
enrolling (1916) 2,234 students. 
2. Nixzeteen business schools, located in coast cities and centers of population, en- 
rolling (1916) more than 5,000 students. 
3. Twelve nautical schools, enrolling (1916) 963 students. 
4, Central School for Industrial Engineers; School of Industrial Engineers of Bar- 
celona; Higher Architectural School of Madrid and Barcelona; Royal Con- 
servatory of Music and Declamation (Madrid), enrolling (1916) 3,042 men and 
women. 
5. School of Higher Pedagogical Studies, enrolling (1916) 470 men and women; 
Woman’s Domestic and Professional School, Central School of Languages. 
. Thirty-one establishments for the instruction of deaf-mutes and blind, enrolling 
(1916) 939 deaf-mutes and 658 blind. Many are aided by religious and munic- 
ipal subventions.! o 
Under the head of schools of arts and industries are grouped: 
Seven schools of arts and trades sustained by the State, enrolling (1916) 1,145 
students. 
Five schools of arts and trades with artistic and industrial apprenticeship, enrolling 
(1916) 6,758 students. 
Thirteen industrial schools, enrolling (1916) 11,908 students. 
Akin to the above group are five schools maintained by deputa- 
tions and ayuntamientos, enro'ling (1916) 4,093 students; and seven 
maintained by State and local authorities, enrolling (1916) 6,425 
students. 
The total appropriation of funds for the last three types of sec- 
ondary schools was, in 1916, nearly $700,000, or an increase of 161 per 
cent since 1902. 
To these should be added the special schools dependent on the 
ministry of public works and grouped as follows: 
1. Special school for road engineers, canals, and harbors, 25 enrolled. 
2. School of assistants in public works, in existence only one year, 19 enrolled. 
3. School of mining engineers (1916-17), 49 enrolled. 
4. Schools for mine superintendents and foremen, located in seven mining centers, 
enrollment 55. 
5. Special school of agronomy (1915-16), 29 students finished course.

fold national foundation for the study 4nd encouragement of the education of deaf-mutes, the blind, and

EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN SPAIN. 411 
The committee of the Cortes appointed in 1917 on the survey of 
educational conditions recommended that all the above extraeduca- 
tional institutions, as well as the institutions established abroad,such 
as the Spanish College of Bologna and the Academy of Fine Arts at 
Rome, should be transferred from the control of the minister of public 
works to that of the minister of public instruction. 
IV. UNIVERSITY EDUCATION. 
University education in Spain, like secondary education, is admin- 
istered along the territorial lines of the 11 university districts. In 
the rector of each university, named by the minister, is vested entire 
local control on the disciplinary and scholastic sides. Associated 
with him in an advisory capacity is the junta of full professors, 
‘The rector is responsible immediately to a designated one of the 
three inspectors general, to whom he must render periodical reports 
of the condition of the university under his charge. Likewise, the 
inspectors general are by law required to inspect the universities, and 
to render reports of their visits to the ministry for transmission to the 
Cabinet. Each of the universities is possessed of its own property 
holdings in law, donated or bequeathed to it; but the expenditure of 
such funds is subject to the consent of the State, and the State 
maintains the university by the subvention necessary each year, As 
has been seen, the administrative connection of the universities with 
the cultural instituto is very close, the same territorial lines and 
ystem of inspection prevailing for both. Preparation for the uni- 
versities is the almost exclusive aim of the institutos. For entrance 
into the university, the student must have completed the full six 
years’ course of the institutos, have received the bachelor’s degee, 
and have passed satisfactory examinations upon the subjects studied 
in. the institutos. In 1916 the 11 universities enrolled 21,300 stu- 
dents in all schools, cultural and professional, with slightly more 
than half pursuing official or prescribed courses. For that year, the 
appropriation for university education was $1,316,062, nearly twice 
the amount for 1909. 
Recommendations have been made advocating the suppression of 
the weaker universities, and the diversion of funds toward the 
strengthening of the others; their closer articulation with the general 
educational system, and the abolition of the exclusive connection 
with the institutos; the modernizing and broadening of the courses 
offered so as to touch the lives and careers of the youths of poor and 
middle-class families, and the throwing open of the universities to 
the people of Spain; the adoption of more rigorous disciplinary and 
administrative measures, with stringent requirements as to conduct 
and residence of students; the abolition of the present overemphasis 
upon formal examinations; the establishment of free election of 
courses; greater care in selection of professors and in attention to 
       
-P-A-G-E-412

their qualifications and activities; encouragement of foundation of 
private institutions of university rank; and university extension 
carried to all the agricultural and industrial points, no matter how 
remote. 
University extension work in the Province of Oviedo, the pioneer 
for Spain, has continued its remarkably useful career. Free popular 
classes have been conducted by teachers of the normal school and 
the university in law, civic instruction, history of civilization, general 
geography, Spanish grammar and literature, elements of natural 
science, physics and chemistry, and practical arithmetic. 
HOLIDAY COURSE FOR FOREIGNERS. 
The sixth session of the vacation course for foreigners was offered 
during the summer of 1918 in Madrid. It is under the auspices of 
the minister of education, and designed primarily to offer to foreign 
teachers of Spariish, or to foreigners interested in Spain and the 
Spanish language and literature, the opportunity of continuing their 
studies through practical work in classes conducted by teachers in 
the central normal schools and professors in the University of Madrid, 
authorities in their respective lines. Short courses and lectures were 
also given on the history, arts, and social life of Spain. Excursions 
to museums and places of historic and literary interest were an- 
nounced. 
V. EXTRA EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. 
In conclusion, certain agencies not organically related to the 
educational system of Spain but making for intellectual progress in 
cooperation with it, deserve mention. Of these, undoubtedly the 
most active is La Junta para Ampliacién de Estudios e Investiga- 
ciones Cientificas (Commission for Enlargement of Studies and Sci- 
entific Investigations). It is composed of eminent educational and 
scientific experts, chosen with due regard to the diversity of intel- 
lectual and religious tendencies in the country. It supports Spanish 
students in foreign countries, encourages new types of educational 
institutions in Spain itself, diffuses knowledge of scientific progress 
in other countries, and encourages by subvention research along 
scientific and sociological lines. 
As an intellectual movement, which, while it does not reach the 
body of the people, yet affects the rising generation in the capital 
city, and ultimately the administrative side of popular education, 
may be mentioned the Association for Woman’s Education, founded 
in 1870. It conducts in Madrid a system of schools, primary, pre- 
paratory, secondary, and commercial, besides offering special classes 
in language, drawing, painting, manual and domestic arts. The 
business courses are this year recognized as equivalent to national 
schools, and pupils certificated from them are admitted to employ- 
ment by the Government.

THE WAR IN ITS EFFECTS ON THE SCHOOLS OF SCANDINAVIA. 
Though the Scandinavian countries have been spared the ravages 
of war, there has not been a day during the struggle when the danger 
of being drawn into it was not imminent. Similarity of geographical 
location with their full independence similarly endangered has 
brought about a degree of unity among these countries which would 
not have been effected readily under other circumstances. Scandi- 
navian working men, leaders of industry, exhibitors, and educators 
have come together. To them the new outlook created by the events 
of the autumn of 1918 will bring enlarged opportunities. The accu- 
mulated energy of these peoples will be set free to issue in achieve- 
ments in undisturbed accord with their racial characteristics. The 
sense of union and enlargement, as one of the results, is particularly 
significant for the schools. As the world events are reaching a con- 
summation in a just and, it is to be hoped, enduring peace, the edu- 
cators and other leaders of the North are anticipating the part their 
own countries will be called upon to take both in respect to their 
individual growth and in rising to a new plane of international ideals, 
Their close proximity to the belligerent countries and their active 
trade relations with these brought on events that upset the economic 
conditions in Scandinavia, with consequent hardships to the people. 
Although traffic to foreign ports was made precarious, the tempting 
prices offered by foreign buyers caused an export of commodities on 
an unprecedented scale. Before restrictive commercial regulations 
could be put into effect there was an alarming depletion of food 
resources. The inevitable result was the immediate rise in the prices 
of foodstuffs and household necessaries. 
To help ward off the threatened hardships, teachers and pupils at 
once offered their personal labor in various productive capacities. 
Though the measures taken in different countries were generally simi- 
lar, they assumed in Norway an organized and practical directness 
worthy of note. In many cities of this country the pupils were 
organized into classified working groups. Under the leadership of 
their teachers they held themselves in readiness to respond to calls 
413 
 
-P-A-G-E-414
  414 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
for help on. the farms. Again, the school gardens and every other 
available plat of ground were handed over to their management and 
tilled under the direction of experts, who applied the most efficient 
methods of intensive farming. 
Careful accounts were kept of the expense for seed, the labor, and 
the yield. Usually each pupil’s share of the proceeds was the crop his 
labor had produced. In order to help in this way, some redistribu- 
tion of the vacation period was found necessary, which seems to have 
been made without serious encroachment on the time for the school 
work. 
In a similar way the system of school kitchens was fully utilized for 
the productive labor of the girl pupils, who were directed in the most 
efficient management of household economics. 
Besides specific lines of work in the immediate charge of the 
teachers, the pupils’ labor was made generally available to employers 
in the cities. In former years child labor was permitted to an extent 
that to us would seem to endanger the welfare of the pupils. But 
it now appears that the authorities are permitting it only under 
strict registration of the pupils’ age, hours, health, and conditions of 
the work. In Gothenborg, Sweden, there is an effort made to have 
the teachers of the city cooperate with the employment bureau in 
placing the labor of pupils. One man teacher and one wom. n 
teacher, selected for their interest in tue pupils, assist the reguar 
city officials. 
Again, with the present needs before them, it was observed that 
some of the subjects of the curricula were more helpful in the present 
crisis than others. One effect of the distinctions thus noted was the 
effort to find more room for the practical kinds of subje.ts; another 
was to try to lay greater emphasis on the utilitarian character of 
others. Teach hygiene, it was urged, not as an academic subject, 
but as one that promotes health and sanitary living. If the text- 
book in use does not lead to these ends, choose a book that does. 
In connection with these departures from educational traditions a 
valuable ; edagogical principle has been emphasized. Educators are 
seeking instruction material outside of books and classrooms to an 
extent that was not practiced before; and they find more of it in 
direct life and living than was ever before considered in connection 
with school purposes. In Sweden and Denmark emphasis is laid on 
making, handling, observing, and producing things; school trips pre- 
ceded by mapping the route and followed by putting the notes of the 
trip into organized form; researches and studies in (ue love lo. aiiuy 
and its resources and industrial possibilities. 
Measures are taken to make permanent use of the experiences that 
have come with the new departures. New activities found to have 
value will be adjusted to the schoo! régime vhere possible—new in-   
-P-A-G-E-415

struction material, new uses of the old, direct efforts of pupils in 
industrial and productive lines. The school men see also a coming 
industrial competition for which it is their duty to prepare the future 
business man, scientist, and technical worker. The Polytechnic 
Institute of Copenhagen is increasing its already excellent facilities 
and adding to its large number of practical courses in order the more 
successfully to prepare for the competition. 
There is a new conception of the teacher’s usefulness, which is not 
likely to be lost sight of after the present economic stringency. 
The teacher’s duty no longer ends when he has taught his pupils 
something. It rests with him in a large measure to see to it that the 
teaching results in a sound and hearty form of living, the funda- 
mental prerequisite of which is a strong and robust physique. In 
order to be of the greatest use here he must enlist the cooperation of 
the parents. This conception has been embodied in the regulations 
of December 31, 1917, applying to the secondary schools of Denmark. 
These regulations provide that parents’ meetings are to be held 
once a year. Those eligible to participate in the proceedings and to 
vote on matters that come up for adoption are all who have children 
at the schools or who are the guardians of children attending. The 
teachers of the schools have the privilege of attending and taking part 
in the discussion. To prepare topics for discussion a committee is 
appointed consisting of the superintendent as chairman, two teachers 
selected by the school board and four members from among the 
parents and guardians. The topics are to consist of the health-pro- 
moting conditions of the school (buildings, scheduled hours, study 
periods, home work, etc.) and other matters such as delinquency of 
pupils, conduct, promotions, appointment of teachers. A report is 
to be submitted to the Minister of Education covering the meetings 
in the district during the year. 
A strong democratic feeling has long existed in the hearts of the 
Scandinavian people, a fecling now struggling to express itself in in- 
tellectual forms and institutions. Under the pressure of local political, 
economic, and geographic conditions it emerges in visible forms with 
marked differences in each country. 
In Denmark this feeling has resulted in the creation of a t~e of 
schools that appeals for patronage to the farmers and middle classes, 
with the purpose of educating and returning them to their own class 
with such efficiency and prestige as education alone can confer. 
Certain changes in the school statutes of Sweden, made in accord- 
ance with educational movements in that country, point to a trend 
toward greater local control of the schools. In 1913 measures were 
taken for the creation of a People’s School Council, to be an advisory 
body, to criticize the general work of the schools, and to take the 
initiative toward improvements. In this capacity it will assume
-P-A-G-E-416
  
416 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
some of the most important duties formerly exercised by the State 
Supervisory Board. In other respects, too, a degree of school control 
formerly vested in boards and committees of the clergy has been 
handed over to similar bodies of laymen. In a number of leading 
cities, details of the local educational institutions, formerly managed 
by the parish vestry meetings, have been put into the hands of the 
city councils. In the Report on the Schools of Sweden, issued by the 
Ecclesiastical Department for 1914-15, is given a series of propositions 
which, according to the suggestions of the board, should be dealt with - 
by subordinate authorities and acted upon without the formality of 
Royal approval. 
As the character of the public elementary schools is the most direct 
expression of the people’s views and wishes, it has been long regarded 
as desirable that the work of the secondary schools should be a direct 
continuation of these. When the real-skola (modern school) in 
Sweden, therefore, attracts pupils at the end of the third year, it 
causes them to make a departure from the original trend. To obviate 
this the communal middle schools grew up to fit the people’s own 
children for government positions without necessitating a change in 
their modes of life. These schools are, moreover, community insti- 
tutions with schedules and working conditions less rigid than those of 
the State schools. 
The people’s voice, too, is strongly heard in its insistence on alter- 
ation in the form and method of the religious instruction in the ele- 
mentary schools. Religious instruction should be brought before the 
children, not in confessional formulas, nor in maxims of conduct, but 
in life pictures taken from the Bible and from the history of the church. 
The earnest consideration given these demands by churchmen and 
educators will eventually lead to changes in the method of instruc- 
tion in Christianity. 
That the Government of Norway has resvonded to the desires of 
Norway’s people is in part evidenced by the liberal appropriations 
made to the farmers and farming. A special session of the Storting 
was called to encourage a greater agricultural output for 1919. An 
allowance of 3,000,000 crowns was made for general agricultural pur- 
poses and 5,000,000 crowns for the cultivation of new land. The 
Association of Norway’s Young Men and Women has urged the erec- 
tion of gymnasia for the country youth. Arrangements are also under 
way to establish an advanced secondary school without the middle 
school, evidently to effect as close a relation as possible between the 
preparatory work of the folk school and the secondary institutions, 
Closely associated with the trend toward democracy is that toward 
internationalism, which in recent years has brought teachers and others 
of these countries together for cooperation. At its meeting in Stock- 
  1 The latest at hand 
 
-P-A-G-E-417
  SCHOOLS OF SCANDINAVIA. 417 
holm in 1910, the Teachers’ Association of the North, an all-Scandina- 
vian organization, celebrated its thirtieth anniversary. The work of 
this body, though not primarly directed towards international ends, 
has really moved in this direction in dealing with the problems which 
the members as teachers have in common. The annual meetings at 
one or other of three capitals brought teachers together as guests and 
hosts, creating opportunities for an understanding of each other’s 
views. The questions that came up for consideration at the regular 
sessions gave rise to a number of school activities in which all were 
called upon to participate. It paved the way for an interchange of 
pupils’ visits among these countries, leading to a better acquaintance 
among the pupils, and, as a consequence, among their parents. From 
1907 on, such school visits have frequently been exchanged between 
Danish and Swedish pupils. In 1908! about 75 pupils at one time 
visited Denmark, being entertained by Danish families and in return 
entertaining their hosts by music and songs from their own country. 
By contribution the members of the Teachers’ Association raised money 
for the erection of a statue of a prominent educator, unveiled during the 
session of 1916 in connection with a special program, The girl pupils 
are publishing a Scandinavian students’ magazine, “Bog og Naal,” 
(Book and Needle), edited by a staff on which the three nations are 
represented. 
These occasions of mutuality have deepened thesense of regard that 
the schools of one country have for the work and ideals of the other. 
Quite spontaneously the work has been so ordered in the respective 
schools as to minimize any feeling of antagonism that might exist 
in the pupils on account of the wars which their ancestors fought 
with each other. While the schools of the three countries were the 
first to get together, there have always been other similar movements, 
such as the Workingmen’s Association, which in the same way have 
conferred on their common interests. Although a distinct form 
of pressure was the moving cause in the recent meeting of the three 
governments in the persons of their kings, the preceding sessions of 
the people made this meeting more easily possible. At any rate 
this group of limited monarchies, essentially democratic, has dis- 
covered the road to the larger internationalism to which the world 
events of November, 1918, invite. A signal instance of their prepar- 
edness for these ideals was recently afforded in Norway, when the 
Peace Association of the country, in 1918, petitioned the Storting 
to establish at the University of Christiania a professorship in the 
science of international peace.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
Obligatory attendance is formally fixed at 7 to 14 years of age, 
but the enforcement is such that the period of attendance depends 
upon the pupil’s actual advancement rather than upon his age. The 
work of both teacher and school management is guided by an official 
handbook, which specifies the subjects, courses, hours, entrance con- 
ditions, holidays, vacations, and the weeks of the school year, which 
may be as high as 40, depending on local requirements. 
The schools are maintained by taxes levied on the State, county, 
and municipality. Each county receives State aid in paying the 
rural teachers, to the amount, of forty-four one-hundredths of the 
salary. In a county where it is found difficult to meet the expenses 
falling to its share, 15 per cent in addition to the above amount may 
be paid to it from the State funds. The expense of heating, lighting, 
and keeping the school property in order falls on the municipality. 
In the cities the State pays one-third of the teachers’ salaries and 
two-thirds of certain service increments, all State contributions being 
limited by a fixed maximum. 
The elementary schools.—Though the elementary school comprises 
seven years, pupils who expect to pursue studies beyond this course 
may enter the middle school from the fifth class. An effort was 
made some years ago to require the entire seven years as preparation 
for the middle school; it was hoped thereby to give education a more 
democratic character and to eliminate the feeling of social diver- 
gence and rank in the schools. Apart from these aspects of the 
proposed plan, educators did not find it practicable, for it would 
push the elementary school beyond its legitimate scope and endanger 
its work. Again it would postpone by two years the time when the 
pupil would naturally pass over to a continuation school. 
The appended table based upon the official plan shows what sub- 
jects are studied in the seven years of the elementary schools and 
the time apportioned to each:

The middle schools—The course of the middle school covers the 
next four years. Pupils are admitted upon examination. Here 
more time is given to Norwegian, including special study of the 
vernacular prevailing in the province in which the school is located. 
The instruction in religion includes reading of the Bible and study of 
the main events in church history. 
Two foreign languages are taken up, English and German, three 
hours per week in the former and four in the latter. According to 
the present trend of opinion more time is to be given to English, which 
will receive five hours from the second class on. The aim of the for- 
eign-language study is to be able to make extempore translations of 
easy foreign texts; but the pupils are also expected to be able to use the , 
language in the course of ordinary easy conversation. 
In nature study the aims are to attain knowledge of those animals 
and plants that are most closely connected with later practical 
callings. Hygiene and the principles of sanitation are here brought 
before the pupils, the study of the human body and the functioning 
of its organs, the effects of strong drink, and, in general, the laws 
seen in such natural phenomena as may readily be brought to the 
child’s attention. 
In mathematics practical considerations take precedence over 
theoretical ones. The child is led to deal with problems that enter 
into the every-day transactions in business, simple bookkeeping, and 
applied geometry. Courses in history lay special stress on modern 
times and events, and, in particular, on the history of Norway and 
its civil organization. 
Geography takes up the natural features, topography, soil, climate, 
and industries of Norway. The work in writing now shows great 
improvement in class-room methods. The teacher leads the pupil 
to see and to know, then to arrange the material, and finally to put 
it in his own individual literary form. 
Drawing takes an altogether practical direction, and aims to pre- 
pare the pupil not only for the later trade schools but for the advanced 
technical schools in which Norway occupies a foremost place. In 
sloyd and manual training the number of hours per week has recently 
been considerably increased. 
The gymnasium.—The gymnasium follows with a three-year 
course. It divides into three branches: (1) The modern branch; 
(2) the history and language branch; and (3) the history-language 
branch with Latin. Accordingly, the pupil, when this stage is 
reached, has before him electives by groups. As the pupils who 
elect the Latin branch become acquainted with this subject rather 
late, the aim of instruction is acquaintance with about 150 pages 
of Caesar, Cicero, and Livy, and the ability to read an easy text 
extempore. The requirements in the mother tongue are familiarity

with a comprehensive selection from Norway’s authors, a survey of 
the language in its origin and historical relations. In translations, 
Greek and Roman authors, Homer and Plato, Shakespeare, Milton, 
and Goethe are taken up. The further studies in German, English, 
and French are calculated to impart a knowledge of the development 
of these peoples respectively. In history and geography the aims 
are identical in kind but naturally higher than at the earlier stages; 
physics, physiology, and sanitation are dealt with more compre- 
hensively than in earlier nature studies; mathematics admits of the 
theoretical phases; drawing takes up advanced problems in technique. 
Other institutions.—Norway’s school system is, in its articulation 
’ of courses and schools, admirably adapted to give consistency and 
completeness to each pupil’s education, no matter at what stage 
choice or necessity compels him to discontinue. Ample provision is 
made for advanced study. Public and private schools for girls 
are found in many towns and cities, and these aim to impart an 
education, different in some particulars from that of boys, but 
equivalent in advancement. There are 22 schools for navigation, 
19 for agriculture, 16 for gardening, 6 for dairy farming, 1 agricultural 
high school, and 6 schools for engineering. In 1917, 45 schools gave 
instruction in metal and textile work and in the common trades of the 
country. The report for the same year lists 11 schools in domestic 
science. The Institute of Technology at Trondhjem takes rank 
among the foremost of its kind in any country; so also the Royal 
Art Institute at Christiania and the School of Mechanic Art at 
Bergen. Ten normal training schools prepare teachers for the work 
in the elementary classes. The Department of Education at the 
university trains teachers for positions in the secondary schools. 
The Royal Frederick University at Christiania makes constant 
research in the sciences, enriching these by eontributions from its 
specialists. 
Affiliated with the university are clinical facilities, collections of 
great value, and a library of 350,000 volumes. There is a botanical 
garden, an astronomical observatory, and a meteorological institute. 
Learned societies, long established and with historic prestige, are 
connected with the university as a central headquarters. 
In Norway the continuation schools' stand on the border line 
between class room and shop. Recitations are held during hours in 
which the pupils are free from their daily duties, usually 6 to 8 or 
7 to 9 in the evening. On account of the full measure of work the 
pupils have in their employment, it is necessary to limit, so far as 
possible, the school tasks to the recitation hours. Most pupils are 
employed in trade, office, shop, factory, or household. At present 
  
1 As these schools continue the subjects with a view of practical application in courses given mainly of 
evenings, some other term than “continuation”? would probably be better.
-P-A-G-E-421
  NORWAY. 421 
they are receiving higher wages than formerly with constant induce- 
ments to do, extra work in the’evening—conditions that make the 
school work very difficult. The report from the continuation 
schools at Christiania shows a large attendance in the commercial 
courses, and a fair attendance in the courses instructing in the 
trades. Courses especially for girls impart instruction in dress- 
making, housekeeping, the care of children, and hygiene. On 
account of the large number of applicants it has been found necessary 
to divide the district into three divisions with one school in each. 
At Stavanger the same kind of institution gives commercial courses during the 
winter where those who have left the elementary school can get special training, 
English is taught here, asit is elsewhere, in the commercial cities of Norway; Norwegian 
is a chief subject; bookkeeping is accorded a prominent place. At Stavanger another 
evening school, partially supported by private means, gives free instruction to boys 
in shoemaking, blacksmith work, and carpentry. Other courses give girls instruction 
in sewing and cooking. A special technical school supported by the State and city 
together, gives day and night courses in drafting and mechanics, which teach young 
men how to handle electrical apparatus and do engineering work necessary in ships 
and factories.? 
SCHOOL GARDENS. 
When gardens for productive purposes first came to exist in con- 
nection with schools they were left to be cultivated by children whose 
parents were poor. Since the outbreak of the war they have attained 
a much greater significance. Experts are instructing the teachers, 
who in turn direct the pupils how to make the most of the ground 
allotted to them. Among the children’s gardens is the teacher’s 
own, supposed to be a model for the others, and expected to show 
how much a little plat of ground can produce. 
The people of Norway have a procedure called “‘inter-cultivation” 
by means of which several crops are raised simultaneously on the 
same lot. Between the potato rows they plant a species of beans 
which thrives without interfering with the potatoes. Among the 
strawberries they plant certain kinds of kale. Under the fruit trees 
and in other shaded places certain other kinds of the cabbage variety 
will grow. To get an early crop of potatoes they are told to start 
them in boxes where they may form long shoots by the time the 
season permits of planting them in the open ground. Seeds and 
plants are furnished the children free of charge; for their labor and 
care they get the crops they raise. It has been found that the 
interest displayed by the children reacts upon the parents so that 
these come to see the significance of the school gardens.

422 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Norway’s School Garden Association issued the following appeal 
in the interest of the work to begin in the spring of 1918: + 
No hands that can do anything must be idle during the coming spring and summer. 
We have in mind many who for the approaching vacation have not as yet found oppor- 
tunities for service in the direct production of foodstuffs. For that reason we are now 
appealing to teachers everywhere in country and city, to teachers of athletic clubs, to 
young peoples’ associations, temperance organizations, welfare associations, and all 
kinds and groups of persons with or without political connections. Place yourselves 
at the head, each in his own circle, and try to effect a cooperation of willing and 
active forces, of both men and women, to the end that we may all get started to work 
for an increase of the foodstuffs our people shall need to maintain themselves the 
coming winter. Obviously it is of particular importance to use the spring months in 
the best way, but it is of no less importance to use the winter months to organize the 
work, We urge teachers to secure the support of the school authority and the agricul- 
tural committee with the view of starting at once to prepare the classes to take hold of 
the work of planting potatoes, cabbage, kale, beets, carrots, and other kinds of vege- 
tables to be used in the kitchen. The chairman orleader of a society should organize 
the members into suitable work groups, say of 6 to 12 in each, and secure the ground, 
the seeds, and the necessary tools, so that everything is ready when spring comes. 
It should be possible to procure the money from patrons in the villages, from the 
banks, and from rich people who may be interested. A part may be raised through 
extra school exhibitions and entertainments during the course of the winter. 
SCHOOL WELFARE ACTIVITIES. 
The system of appointments and eventual pensions provides 
inducements for teachers to become permanent members of the 
community, thereby making it possible for their advice and help to 
extend outside the school and beyond the courses. Large and care- 
fully selected libraries for children have been organized mainly by the 
teachers. Despite their limitations remote rural districts have 
accomplished much in this line. Within their resources they are 
following the example set by the cities. Every school attempts to 
have at least the beginning of alibrary. In Christiania at the Central 
Library are attractive reading rooms for children, and over 340,000 
volumes selected to serve their needs. For the year 1915-16, 
37,974 volumes were loaned. 
To teach the children thoughtful and purposeful thrift almost all 
the schools of Christiania have conducted banking activities to take 
care of the pupils’ deposits. During 1915-16 there was a falling off 
in the number of depositors as well as in the sum total of deposits, 
but the following year showed a recovery in the totals, so that the 
year’s accounts amounted to 144,000 crowns. Much of this is drawn 
when the pupils finish their courses or leave the city. It is often 
used for clothes to wear at commencement and graduation exercises. 
In these connections the teachers never fail earnestly to impress their 
pupils with the importance of continuing to save. The work is 
supported and handled by the Savings Bank of Christiania.

The health supervision has been hampered by the limited number 
of physicians who could be assigned to the work, and also by insuffi- 
cient means to provide an adequate number of nurses and caretakers 
to follow up and apply the physicians’ directions. Though the report 
indicates that the work has been slow, it points to exceptional thor- 
oughness. It is the aim of the authorities cooperating with the 
medical inspectors that no child in Norway shall suffer in health or 
development on account of defects or diseases than can be remedied. 
There appears to be gratifying promptness in the application of the 
remedial measures prescribed in each case—whether for eyes, teeth, 
nose, adenoids, or tonsils. School physicians are directed to proceed 
at once to treat curvature of the spine,’ usually by massage when 
appropriate, and aenemic conditions by ordering better nourishment, 
fresh air, and rest. Where the parents are unable to provide the 
means, the municipality takes care of the case. A record is kept of 
each child’s physical condition, with a fullness that to a layman 
would seem unnecessary. 
In the schools of Christiania are ample facilities for pupils’ baths, 
and each child is instructed to take at suitable intervals a shower or 
plunge bath of a temperature carefully regulated. The school records 
show to what extent each pupil has availed himself of these facilities. 
Instruction in swimming is a regular part of the school work, and the 
reports for 1915-16 showed that 636 boys and 480 girls learned to 
swim during the year. Formal athletic exercises with the use of 
simple apparatus are encouraged and regularly conducted. The 
pupils of this country need no special inducements to take part in 
whatever develops bodily strength and prowess, and, as would be 
expected, they are especially enthusiastic in their national sports of 
skating and skiing. 
Lunch rooms have long been connected with the schools in some 
form or other. Formerly the janitor had a supply of buns, rolls, 
coffee, milk, etc., which were furnished the children at a small cost. 
Now many cities supply the primary children with one meal a day 
during the winter months. To poorer children this is free; to others 
it is sold at small cost. A central cooking department in Christiania 
supplies the elementary school children with daily portions of the 
best food served hot under the direction of a matron. A committee 
of teachers decides what children shall be served, upon application by 
the parents. 
In the city of Stavanger municipal welfare measures for school 
children have assumed still more comprehensive scope. The district 
comprises about 150,000 people, of whom about one-third live in the 
city. The children are supplied not only with free books and writing 
material, free medical and dental care, medicine, and, when needed, 
free shoes and stockings, but also free midday meals. Three times a
-P-A-G-E-424
    424 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
week a regular dinner is served. The meals are served in three differ- 
ent localities, a steam bakery supplying the food. It is hoped that 
the food may eventually be prepared in.a community kitchen, as in 
Copenhagen. Many mothers with young children work in the fac- 
tories. These women often do not have sufficient time to see that 
their children are properly fed, and a diet of bread, butter, and coffee 
is likely to be the rule; hence the importance of the wholesome and 
nutritious meal the school furnishes. A committee decides each case 
before the children are admitted to the school tables. 
SPEECH FORMS IN THE SCHOOLS. 
The necessity of sanctioning the use of two language forms—the 
book language and the vernacular—has handicapped and often em- 
barrassed the teachers of Norway. One of these speech forms is 
always tending to supplant the other, with the consequent danger of 
provoking controversy, as teachers and school boards take sides in 
behalf of one or the other. At school meetings and in the educa- 
tional journals they have become perplexing problems. 
In recent years the vernacular has made headway and gained 
adherents to such an extent that in the west, according to a member 
of the Storting, Mr. Fretheim, two-thirds of the districts have elected 
it as the preferred speech form; in the south about one-third, and in 
the north about one-tenth. As schoolbooks are printed in both 
forms, and as pupils sometimes show greater readiness in the one and 
sometimes in the other, and, again, as the vernacular has not yet 
attained complete fixedness in orthography and grammar, the teachers 
and boards are constantly confronted with the necessity of making 
difficult selections and adjustments. In order to avoid clashes Goy- 
ernment regulations were adopted with the view of permitting teachers 
and pupils to make the adjustment on an elective basis with a min- 
imum requirement. 
In their final examinations pupils, according to the law of 1907, 
were required to write one essay in the vernacular, and explain a 
selection from Old Norse literature from the vernacular and also 
from the book language. Two compositions are required to be writ- 
ten in either the book language or the provincial tongue. Candi- 
dates who present both of these in the same language are required 
to write an additional easy theme in the other language. 
These regulations were amended by a law passed during the year 
1918, and now read: 
1. In the oral instruction the pupils are to use their own speech 
form and the teacher will, so far as possible, adapt his own natural 
speech form in accordance therewith.
-P-A-G-E-425
    NORWAY. 425 
2. The school board will decide for each district, class, or division 
(a) whether the written work of the pupils is to be done in the vernacu- 
lar or in the book language; and (b) what kind of primer is to be 
used. 
In regard to textbooks the pupils may use either those printed in 
the vernacular or those in the book language in accordance with the 
choice of parents or guardians. 
In a district where parallel classes have been organized, parents 
who wish their children taught in the speech form which is not the 
predominant one at the school, may make a demand to this effect 
provided there are enough children to constitute an entire class, and, 
provided further, that it can be done without materially increasing 
the expenses of the school. Children for whom a speech form has 
thus been chosen may not without the consent of the board pass over 
into classes with a different speech form. 
TEACHERS’ PENSIONS IN NORWAY. 
The pension enactment of the Storting of 1918 places the teachers 
on a par with government officials. It is provided that the retirement 
of a teacher may be requested by the school board by the time he is 
within 3 years of the pension age; if not, he may retain his position 5. 
years beyond this limit. When he comes within 10 years of the teach- 
ing limit of 70, he has the privilege of applying for retirement and 
pension provided the sum of his years of service and of his age is as 
much as 80 years. At the age of 60 with 30 years of service to his. 
credit he receives full pension. At 60 with 20 years of service he 
may be permitted to retire, but he receives then only two-thirds of 
the full pension. 
The total amount of the teachers’ salary compensation forms the 
basis for computing the pension: Fixed salary, bonus, compensation 
for free home, light, fuel, and whatever else the regulations acknow]l- 
edge as salary, such as pay as choir leader, secretary of the school 
board, etc. The pension is computed on the sum total of these salary 
units. 
Full old-age pension presupposes at least 30 years of service, and 
comprises 66 per cent of the remuneration if it does not exceed 3,000 
crowns. If the salary in the aggregate is larger, the pension is 
decreased by 0.004 crown for every additional crown up to 7,000. 
Upon voluntary withdrawal with less than 30 years of service the 
pension is diminished by one-thirtieth for each year; yet it must 
make an aggregate of at least 30 per cent of the full pension. 
A teacher receives a disability pension when his physical or mental 
powers are impaired to such an extent that he must leave his position. 
In such cases the years of service are disregarded and the pension 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
  426 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
made equal to that for retirement at the age limit. In other cases of 
invalidity the pension is diminished in the ratio of the old-age pen- 
sion, yet not so as to be less than three-fourths of this. Partial 
inability to earn salary is the cause for a corresponding decrease in the 
pension. A widow’s pension is 30 per cent of the salary or the pen- 
sion of the deceased teacher, yet never less than 200 crowns and not 
more than 1,500. It is not paid in cases where a teacher marries 
after his sixtieth year or after his retirement. It ceases upon remar- 
riage. Orphans under 18 receive each 25 per cent of the widow’s 
pension, yet the total amount received by the children must not be 
more than 100 per cent of this. If both parents are dead, the pension 
of the children is doubled.” ! 
WAR CONDITIONS AND THE SCHOOLS, 
During the entire war Norway’s industries and commerce suffered 
more than those of any other neutral country. She sustained enor- 
mous losses by the destruction of a great part of her merchant fleet. 
Traffic from the first was insecure and, as a consequence, marine 
insurance was high, Raw material was difficult to procure and the 
finished products of shops and factories difficult to bring to the 
consumer. 
While the war did not result in commandeering school buildings and 
the labor of teacher and pupil as in the belligerent countries, it 
virtually did this in an indirect way. The high cost of everything 
necessary to sustain life compelled all available forms of labor to 
become productive. 
The pupils of many schools were requested to organize themselves 
into groups and, together with their teachers, to be ready to respond 
to calls for help on the farms. The shops and factories frequently 
experienced a shortage of labor and tried to recruit it from the same 
sources. 
For these reasons pupils individually and in groups were virtually 
compelled to leave their class work to take up something more urgent. 
More or less confusion in the year’s work was one of the immediate 
effects of this. Another was to emphasize a distinction, as never 
before, between book learning and training leading to productiveness. 
The time was opportune for an inquiry into the aims and intentions 
of almost every subject in the course. What was its purpose? 
Where did it lead to? And what would it help to produce? Asa con- 
sequence there arose a tendency to give preference to subjects that in 
these respects measured up to the demands of the times. There 
appeared also an inclination to stress the more practical phases of 
subjects already established in the courses. Educators began to

point out that geometry, for instance, dealing with lines and angles, 
squares and cubes, could be brought into closer coordination with 
the art of making things—carpentry, cabinet making, building— 
where the lines and curves were embodied. Zoology might deal with 
domestic animals, their ways, and values, as well as with zebras and 
lions. 
The importance of daily work and labor, and the duty of bringing it 
into the class room and teaching it as a recognized subject was dis- 
cussed in the teachers’ journals and meetings. It was one of the 
chief points adopted by the Pedagogical Folk Meeting in Christiania on 
August 25, 1918. But the teachers of Norway went further. They 
were not content with simply giving labor a place in the curriculum; 
they demanded conditions that should obliterate social distinctions 
between work with the hand and work mainly with the intellect— 
they insisted on the prestige of labor. With this in view the educators 
of Norway have formally asked that labor should be brought into 
schools hitherto considered exclusive, and there given a place of 
distinction. 
On the purely economic side the war affected teachers severely. 
During normal times a teacher in Norway has a fair salary. The 
pension of which he is eventually assured permits him to look forward 
to the future without anxiety and hence to do his work with a full 
collection of his powers. Yet his remuneration is so carefully adjusted 
to his actual expense that a sudden increase in the cost of living 
creates distress. 
Hence the war brought hard times to the teacher as well as to 
others. His salary was not commensurate with the added outlay. 
The authorities were willing to provide relief, but to adjust salaries 
by enactments of the Storting proved to be slow. Through their 
journals and such other means of publicity as they could command, 
the teachers brought their economic difficulties before the people. At 
its meeting in Trondhjem the Teachers’ Association virtually resolved 
‘itself into an organization to campaign for relief. The parliamentary 
response came, first in the form of war bonuses and high expense 
bonuses, and, finally, with a plan fora direct general increase of sala- 
ries commensurate with the present times. 
A communication from the president of the National Teachers’ As- 
sociation of Norway, Mr. A. Kirkhusmo, dated November 20, 1918, 
shows that while the bill providing an increase in salaries was pending - 
before the Storting, the. people throughout the country generally 
took independent action and very materially increased the salaries 
in their respective communities, 
 
-P-A-G-E-428
  e 
428 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Economic pressure, too, caused a shortage of teachers that greatly 
handicapped the work of instruction in certain parts of Norway. 
Other lines of employment with more satisfactory pay attracted many 
teachers. A report came to the department of education at Chris- 
tiania that in 1917 several hundred positions had remained vacant 
and that during the same year a still greater number of positions had 
to be filled by persons without professional training. In some parts. 
of the country the weeks of the term of some schools were arranged 
so that the teacher could serve two schools. 
The moral effect of the war on the pupils was forced upon the: 
attention of the teachers. Familiarity with the accounts from the 
front, with details of bloodshed and violence, tends to disturb the 
psychic balance of a pupil in his impressionable years. Reports from 
the warring nations state that moral confusion sets in among school 
children to the extent of causing an alarming increase in juvenile 
offenses. The teachers of Norway are attempting to prevent the 
damage that threatens the children from exposure to notions of war 
and violence. They seek to lead the attention of the pupils away 
from these foreign interests to the interests and the affairs of their 
native land. In the scenes of Norway, in their fields and fjords, in 
their commerce and their industries, the teachers have found counter- 
attractions more favorable to the moral and psychic health of the 
pupils. 
The war has emphasized another duty that falls on the teacher. 
The clergymen of the peace association of Norway have addressed 
themselves to the General Peace Association requesting the latter to 
formulate plans to enlist the teachers actively in the cause of peace. 
It had been assumed at the Peace Conference at Bern, in 1915, that. 
the clergy could accomplish the most in the interest of peace. But 
later it became obvious that the field was too large, and that consid- 
erations of a purely pyschological character added to the difficulty, 
owing to the popular misconception that the church and the school 
were two independent institutions. The public comments touching 
this question of the work for peace has brought the teachers’ share in 
it into a clear light. No other class has an opportunity like the 
teacher for instilling and confirming humane and cultural sentiments. 
of peace in the hearts of the young. 
PRESENT TREND IN EDUCATIONAL THOUGHT AND SCHOOL LEGISLATION. 
The present efforts to give the schools a more organic continuity 
from the primary years to the years of secondary advancement have: 
their origin in the same general causes in all the countries of northern 
Europe. In reports prepared under the direction of the Ecclesiastical 
and Education Department of Norway, comprising a consensus of
-P-A-G-E-429
NORWAY. 429 
opinions among the school men of that country, the movements 
there are traced and set forth in full. The several official publica- 
tions issued under the auspices of that body, the latest bearing the 
date of March 2, 1917, indicate the issues that are uppermost. Sup- 
plementary accounts in the educational journals of Norway make it 
possible to follow the movements up to the end of 1918. 
The committee entrusted with the preparation of the report main- 
tains that not only educational, but, in a measure, social purposes 
come into play in adapting the schools of that country to the needs 
of the people. The unrest noted with the consequent demand for 
altered adaptations arises from the present democratic insistence 
that the purely social aim be eliminated and that the child’s bent and 
endowments alone determine the stage where its divergence into a 
selected educational course may be permitted. With past school 
traditions in mind the committee maintains that in a community 
where a child’s position in life is determined by its birth it is compara- 
tively easy to plan a school well adapted to impart a fitting measure 
of information and training; a steadily ascending course of develop- 
ment leading directly toward the goal could then be planned, mak- 
ing it unnecessary for the learner to stray into by-paths or to be dis- 
tracted by minor aims, but leading him to concentrate all his attention 
and bend all his energies toward reaching the goal clearly in sight 
from the beginning. 
From the first the courses would, under these conditions, take 
different directions in accordance with various aims, soon creating 
a marked distance between the routes by their constant divergence. 
For this reason it would be difficult, if not impossible, to pass over 
from one route to the other, which might become desirable where 
one should discover during his progress that he had been mistaken 
in his destination or his endowments, and hence wished his aim 
changed. 
In the latter part of the last century the movement toward 
unification began, when the preparatory classes of the middle 
schools were, to a great extent, taken over by the folk school. With 
the same general aim the law of 1896 provided a further lengthening 
of the folk school by two years. 
After that date interest in reforms toward this end became more 
general, at least among teachers and patrons of schools. In conse- 
quence further changes were discussed in 1909 in connection with 
the debate on the budget for secondary schools. In this discussion 
it became clear that the articulation between the folk school and 
the middle school was unsatisfactory, and that it might be well to 
consider whether an adjustment in subjects and courses could not 
be effected requiring pupils to complete the seven classes instead of 
five of the folk school as entrance condition to the middle school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-430
430 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The opposition contended that the present law did not place any 
obstacles in the way of such articulation, but that carrying it into 
general effect would necessitate extensive revisions of instruction 
plans and textbooks and that in the few places where it had been 
tried the result had not been satisfactory; even a three-year middle 
school had had great difficulties in bringing its pupils to a point of 
advancement where they could pass the examination, An alterna- 
tive course of growth was suggested, by pointing out that the com- 
mon school itself was capable of a development to the extent of 
preparing its own pupils for an examination virtually equal to that 
of the middle school. A nucleus of subject matter in the instruction 
could be provided and required of all; parallel with this could be 
elective subjects for those who had the middle school examination 
in view. 
On November 7, 1911, a committee of seven persons was appointed 
to prepare a report on the question of how to effect a closer union 
between the folk school and the secondary school. As points of 
departure for their work the laws defining the aims of the two 
schools, respectively, were cited: 
The folk school should help to give children a Christian bringing up and such general 
training as should be common to all members of society; the middle school continuing 
from the folk school should give the pupils a finished and advanced general training 
adapted to the receptivity of the children’s years. 
In May, 1915, the committee made a report in which the trend 
of opinion among Norway’s schoolmen was clearly exhibited. 
Among the difficulties set forth in the committce’s published 
statement was that the contemplated reorganization would involve 
transition stages requiring special adjustment in courses. and man- 
agement. About 70 per cent of the municipal middle schools with- 
out gymnasium had only a total enrollment of from 40 to 150 pupils. 
If these schools lose their two lower classes, as some of the proposed 
plans would require, the attendance would be cut down to such 
an extent that they could not well be continued as independent schools, 
They would be merged with the folk school, and there would, in 
consequence, be one head for both institutions. This adjustment 
would have to be left to the administrative boards. Many middle 
schools are so large that even if they should lose the two lower 
classes they would continue to exist as independent institutions 
with respect to buildings, faculties, and management. As many of 
them are located in the larger cities, they would, when reorganized 
as an undivided institution, according to the plan under considera- 
tion, come to have a number of parallel classes. In those schools 
that offer full, or part, gymnasuim work, it would be most natural 
to let the proposed two-year middle school merge with the gym- 
nasium and be under the superintendence of its rector. 
   
-P-A-G-E-431
  NORWAY. 431 
Tn adopting an order of this kind, various difficulties would be 
met, and not least in regard to the difference in the present training 
and duties of the teachers in the two classes of schools. The com- 
mittee pointed out that the reorganization of the present middle 
schools into schools of two-year scope will have the immediate 
effect of making superfluous a number of teachers now holding 
positions without any provision for their employment in either 
the folk school or the reconstituted middle schools, even though 
these and parallel classes connected with them should increase in 
number. 
At this stage of the progress the matter was again taken up by 
the Storting in 1916 and a sum of 3,000 crowns was appropriated 
to enable the committee, to continue its investigations. The plans 
of the committee, which were in the meantime fully discussed by 
schoolmen throughout the country, and eventually submitted to 
the Storting were in substance as follows: 
1. An outline for the apportionment of hours and plan for in- 
struction in a two-year middle school continued from a seven-year 
folk school. In order to show. the articulation best adapted to 
effect the desired coalescence, the plan includes a time scheme cover- 
ing years six and seven of the folk school and two years of the 
middle school. It also defined the aim to be attained in each subject 
in the concluding year of the folk school—the degree of advancement, 
in fact, that would have to be reached in religion, Norwegian history, 
science, etc. In a similar way the outline set forth the aim of the 
middle school. Specific remarks on the outline were then added 
touching on such details of subjects, hours, and adjustments as 
would be likely to come up in the reorganization. In the subse- 
quent discussion of this outline, considerable opposition was met on 
the ground that it necessitated a serious disturbance of the plans 
followed by the folk school without any real and obvious gain. 
2. The second proposition was a combination of a three-year 
middle school continued from the seventh class of the folk school. 
In the event this plan should be considered for adoption it was sug- 
gested that it might be well to follow the lead of a number of cities 
that had already put it into effect, and that a typical normal plan be 
adopted for these schools. Several suggestions regarding subjects 
were also made by the committee. 
3. In view of the anticipated objections to plans 1 and 2 the com- 
mittee drafted a third plan: A six-year folk school followed by ad- 
vanced courses of instruction, one of which comprised a three-year 
middle school. There would then be two divisions of the six-year 
period, namely, an infant school of two years, and an elementary 
school of four. A schedule for these divisions covering subjects and 
hours was appended by the committee, though they did not find it
-P-A-G-E-432
  432 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
necessary. to enter into all details of the instruction under this plan. 
The advantages gained by it would be: (a) The middle school examina- 
tion would be reached after nine years; (b) the course of the middle 
school would comprise three years; (c) the folk school would at no 
point in its work be disturbed by adjustments necessary to the plan 
of the middle school. 
4. In its further work the committee dealt with a plan for a practical 
continuation course in the middle school and found that there were no 
serious difficulties in the way of shaping a course of this kind, so that 
it would lead to the middle-school examination requiring equal ad- 
vancement. The gain in this arrangement would be that the impres- 
sion of a subordinate rank would be removed from the practical in- 
struction which up to this time had been connected with the folk 
schools. There would, in every case, be the positive gain that such a 
course would lead to a goal which prevailing views associated with a 
certain respect and prestige. 
The new arrangements thus outlined involved considerable de- 
parture from the present plan and organization of the schools, and 
in some cases, necessitated a regrettable disturbance of the present 
order. The Ecclesiastical and Education Department found that the 
views embodied in the report should be given thorough consideration, 
but as none of the propositions had a sufficiently general approval 
to be recommended for embodiment in the statutes to govern future 
school organizations, the department recomended to the budget com- 
mittee of 1917 that 10,000 crowns be appropriated for the use of a 
new committee to push the work on this important and difficult 
problem to completion. Such further expenditure and delay did 
not meet with favor either among schoolmen or laymen. | 
Moreover, the general discussion aroused by the committee’s re- 
port created a feeling among all ranks that the views of the people of 
the nation on these matters should be given official expression. 
During the spring and summer of 1918 this opinion gained support 
at a number of meetings held by various teachers’ associations. The 
proposition received such general approval that a call was issued 
through the educational journals for a general teachers’ and citizens’ 
school meeting to. be held at the University of Christiania in August, 
1918. 
In this way there came about what has been regarded as an epoch- 
making educational mass meeting; certainly this was one of the most 
notable school events in Scandinavia of 1918. Laymen and educators 
assembled at the University of Christiania on August 25, and out- 
lined the demands that the Norwegian people should make on the 
schools, In formal resolutions categorically adopted they asserted 
that—
-P-A-G-E-433
  NORWAY. 433 
1. “Bringing-up and character forming are more important for 
the elementary and secondary schools than intellectual training.” 
Insistence was laid on fewer examinations, more personal responsi- 
bility of the teacher, more efficient supervision, and greater freedom 
for the initiative of the individual. In discussing the point last men- 
tioned those present deprecated the pressure that influences or com- 
pels a teacher to move only in the direction pointed out by a political 
or educational majority, and that laws, regulating plans, and examina- 
tions circumscribe the work. 
3. Training for actual work must be made more prominent in all 
schools as well as in the middle schools and the continuation schools. 
The teachers’ professional preparation should have regard to this. 
In this connection it was urged that the new middle schools should 
not be made more popular, but that every-day work should be ele- 
vated and given its place and prestige in the middle schools now re- 
- ded as exclusive. 
. “The Government should, as soon as possible, appoint a com- 
es to prepare a unified plan for continuation schools, work schools, 
and other classes of schools to enter into a legally fixed continuity for 
an educational training based on the elementary schools. This com- 
mittee should include members from all classes of city and rural 
ae from the primary to the university.” 
. “Tt will i improve the peoples’ bringing-up if each kind of school 
Oe its own council and that all of Norway has a central council of 
control, a national board representing all kinds of schools from the 
primary to the university. But it should be provided that each class 
of institutions shall act with full independence under the regulations 
of its own board.” \ 
There would, accordingly, be established a, rd for secondary 
schools, one each for agricultural schools, t ical, normal, and 
engineering schools; and each board should work with complete inde- 
pendence of the others. At the same time it was felt that they have 
somuch in common as to require a central supervising board represent- 
ing them all and consisting of the superintendents of the individual 
boards, the rectors of the high schools, and the rector of the university. 
6. “The State should establish a teachers’ high school, either inde- 
pendent or as a part of the university. Whatever is fundamental in 
daily work should here receive the place and rank that corresponds to 
the basic elements in the people’s life.” ‘And it was added that 
real, every-day work should have a place in recognized courses of 
manual work for men and women, household, natural history, etc., 
yet in such a way that the aim of moral stability and the forming of 
character should give direction to it all.”

That the work done by the school committee should lead to such a 
referendum was perhaps not anticipated, but though the complica- 
tions resulting make an early enactment by the Storting impossible, 
they will eventually lead to a fuller embodiment of the people’s views 
in the school system.

GENERAL VIEW OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 
Public education in Sweden is administered through the Eccle- 
siastical and Education Department and its various bureaus. A 
local school board, consisting of four members chosen by the parish 
assembly, has charge of details touching the schools of each parish. 
The pastor, who formerly was an ex officio member of the board, is 
no longer so, according to a recent ruling, but must be elected like 
the others in order to become a member. Another change in the 
local school administration has resulted in the transfer of the man- 
agement in many cities from a separate board to the city council. 
Changes are also contemplated in the organization of the diocesan 
boards, which exercise supervision over the local administration. 
These boards, it is generally conceded, are not as at present consti- 
tuted adapted for atisfactory superintendence of instruction.’ 
But in regard to change that would be expedient to make them 
more capable, opinions do not concur. In the propositions pre- 
pared by a special committee and dealt with by the Riksdag, the 
alternative appeared to be either to reconstitute the diocesan boards 
so as to guarantee that they would deal with school matters with 
greater regard to the interests of the folk school and the demands of 
educational science or else that their functions as educational boards 
should cease altogether. Thus far the Riksdag has taken no other 
action than to refer the consideration of this question back to the 
committee. With the same purpose of perfecting the administration 
of the schools successive enactments from 1904 to 1914 resulted in 
the creation of a general supervisory board for the control of sec- 
ondary education and of a special board independent of the other to 
exercise supervision over the folk schools and normal schools.

The character of the school inspection has also received much at- 
tention. The inspectors are appointed by the State; they visit the 
schools, confer with the school authorities; assist and advise these 
officials, examine petitions and appeals, and investigate and report 
on requests for State aid and for enlarging the activities of schools. 
How these important duties shall be attended to with the best re- 
sults has also been the subject of investigation by a committee of 
the Riksdag. This body reached the conclusion that the work of 
the inspectors was that of specialists and that they should be ap- 
pointed and directed by regulations with this character of their duties 
in view. Accordingly, the entire country was organized into new 
districts of inspection; a new code of instruction was provided, and 
new inspectors to the number of 34 were appointed. 
Education in Sweden has been compulsory since 1842, the ages of 
required attendance being 7 to 14. If a child has not made satis- 
factory advance at the end of the fourteenth year, further attend- 
ance is required. These measures have had the effect of reducing 
illiteracy to a fraction of 1 per cent. 
The common school period covers six years, divided into a primary 
course of two years and an elementary course proper of four. The 
pupil may then enter either a continuation school of two or three 
years or an intermediate secondary school, the latter continuing his 
schooling to the age of about 16. 
As early as the third year of the elementary course the pupil’s fur- 
ther studies may begin to assume a particular direction, if such has 
been determined. If advanced studies are contemplated, the pupil 
will enter the modern secondary school, which after six years opens 
to him either the modern gymnasium or the classical gymnasium, 
both concluding with a final examination (student-examen) propar- 
atory for the university. 
From the continuation school and the communal middle school the 
way leads to various trades and practical activities, business schools, 
household schools, agricultural schools, technical schools, and 
engineering. 
The school year averages 35 weeks, 210 days, with a maximum of 
35 hours per week. This normal duration of the year is varied to 
some extent by local conditions. If the degree of advancement 
attained at the completion of a certain stage be measured by the 
number of years from the pupil’s entrance in the primary class, the 
following view of it will appear: (a) The elementary school com- 
pleted after six years; (b) a continuation school, usually after eight 
years; (c) the real skola (modern school) after nine; (d) the com- 
munal middle school after 10; (e) the gymnasium after 12. (It is 
continued from the fifth class of the modern school.)

  436 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
Schedules apportioning the time and specifying the subjects are 
drawn up for each school on the basis of a compendium furnished 
by the State. The school plans are not all uniform, for the intention 
is to leave such freedom to the local districts as may be required by 
conditions that prevail there. In the elementary school Bible stories 
and Luther’s Smaller Catechism give the fundamentals in religious 
instruction. The Swedish language, history, arithmetic, geography, 
and natural history are taken up first. Swedish and religion are 
continued throughout; bookkeeping, psychology, civics, drawing, 
gymnastics, singing, domestic-science practice, and a foreign lan- 
guage (generally English) are added in the course of the last two or 
three years. Subjects pertaining to health, such as the hygiene of 
the teeth, are made obligatory. Training in swimming has of iate 
received such attention that it is iikely to be taken up as a regular 
subject. 
Sweden has 77 advanced secondary schools, 39 with the six-year 
plan and 38 both real-skola and gymnasium, or the nine-year plan, 
and also 20 private institutions with gymnasium rank. 
The fact that advanced schools for girls did not exist in any great 
number till toward the close of the nineteenth century is due to tra- 
ditions that did not recognize education as necessary to a girl’s 
advancement in life; now there are more than 80 institutions of this 
kind having a total enrollment of about 18,600 pupils. The courses 
include three years primary and eight years advanced instruction. 
The work in the upper classes has a gymnasium character, and leads 
to a final examination conferring a standing equal to that of the 
gymnasia for boys. In comparing the curricula of the upper classes 
with the corresponding ones in the gymnasia for boys we find, as 
would be expected, several new subjects, including domestic science 
and needlework. In the modern languages there is also a wider range 
of choice. 
In the spring of 1918 there were 49 peoples’ high schools in Sweden. 
Here they are similar in aims and methods to those of Denmark, 
where they had their origin, but unlike those of Denmark they have 
never been connected with any special folk movements in religion or 
civil life. They provide short practical courses for grown people 
whose schooling has been interrupted, say at 12 or 14 years, but who 
later wish further training. They receive their pupils mainly from the 
farms and they educate them back to the farms. They are founded 
by private or community endeavor; they receive state subsidy—in 
1917 it amounted to 476,000 crowns—but they are, in the main, 
independent of state boards of control. The semesters are so divided 
that men receive instruction in the winter and women in the summer. 
There are no examinations, either entrance or final. The 30 or

more agricultural schools throughout the country are conducted in 
close connection with them." 
Trade schools are found in all the principal cities. In Stockholm 
nine of these were established between 1912-1915. They comprise 
a machine workers’ school, carpenters’ school, blacksmiths’ school, 
electric motor school, school for tinsmiths and coppersmiths, plumbers’ 
school, milliners’ school, dressmakers’ school, school in household 
work, bakers’ school, and a bricklayers’ school. Each school is under 
state supervision having, however, its own board. With few excep- 
tions they are “one-day” schools; that is, pupils attend one day a 
week and work as apprentices the remaining five. Their immediate 
object is to secure for the pupils suitable work in the shops and fac- 
tories. The superintendent is in close cooperation with factories and 
their foremen, the latter often being instructors at the schools. 
They give progressive courses of three years. The entrance condi- 
tions are to have attained 14 years, passed through 6 years elementary 
school, and, finally, to have secured employment in a shop of the 
kind in which the school gives instruction. Obligatory studies are 
reading, writing, social economy, bookkeeping such as applies to the 
trade, hygiene, and gymnastics. Though attendance is voluntary, 
studies may here be taken up to fulfill the requirements of the law of 
1918, which makes attendance at a continuation school obligatory 
upon all pupils after having completed the elementary period. 
Among institutions where advanced technical instruction is given 
are the following: The Technical School at Stockholm with five 
departments: 1. Technical Evening School; 2. Technical School for 
Women Pupils; 3. Higher Industrial Art School; 4. Building and 
Trade School; 5. Mechanical School, which has 80 teachers and about 
2,000 pupils. 
The Technical School at Eskilstuna has a department for the finer 
kinds of forging and metal working with instruction in freehand 
drawing with styles of art, modeling, carving, engraving, metal cast- 
ing, chasing, metal hammering, etching, galvanizing, forging, filing, 
and turning. Other technical colleges are located at Malmé, Boris, 
Orebro, Norrképing, and Hirnésand. 
The Royal Technical High School at Stockholm gives advanced 
instruction in the mechanical arts and sciences. It is open only to 
those who have passed the final examination at the gymnasium. The 
course of study is four years and comprises: (1) Machine construc- 
tion; (2) electrical engineering; (3) chemical technology; (4) mining 
science; (5) road construction and hydraulic engineering; (6) archi- 
tecture; and (7) shipbuilding. There is also a department called 
the Material Testing Institute. The teaching staff comprises 24 
professors, 2 lecturers, 24 special teachers, and a number of assistants.

438 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The past few years have been marked by a number of reforms and 
improvements in the facilities for preparing and training teachers. 
The salaries of the teaching staff at teachers’ colleges have in general 
been liberally increased; so have also the allowances and stipends of 
students at these institutions. Nine training colleges for men, six for 
women, two private colleges for women—one at Gothenborg and one 
at Stockholm—prepare teachers for positions in secondary schools. 
They admit pupils between the ages of 18 and 26, the academic condi- 
tion for entrance being the satisfactory completion of the elementary 
course. 
The courses comprise four years, much of the time of the last two 
years being devoted to practice teaching. There are 34 other train- 
ing schools for teachers of the primary grades. These give shorter 
courses, the total time of attendance amounting to from 8 to 16 
months. There are three schools for teachers of defectives, 6 for 
sloyd, and 5 for domestic economy. Special institutions also train 
teachers in drawing, music, gymnastics, and games. In 1908 a pro- 
fessorship in education was established at the University of Upsala, , 
and in 1911 a professorship in psychology and education was insti- 
tuted at the University of Lund. 
In order to provide for the continuous improvement of teachers, 
a number of courses, more or less permanently established, have 
come into existence. For this purpose there has been a lecture 
course in Stockholm since 1890. Academic vacation courses are 
given during successive years at Upsala, Stockholm, Lund, and 
Gothenborg. Special instruction in agriculture and horticulture is 
furnished through organized effort in Naiis and Jénképing. Various 
teachers’ travel funds have been provided. A State grant makes 
an annual sum of 12,000 crowns available for this purpose. Lund, 
Malmé, Gothenborg, and Stockholm have municipal travel funds of 
from a few hundred crowns to several thousands annually. 
  CARE OF THE PUPILS’ HEALTH. 
The school authorities require an examination of the pupils’ sight 
and hearing at stated times and have provisions for applying reme- 
dies and correctives for abnormal conditions. A statement from a 
physician is made out prescribing the treatment adapted to promote 
normal health and growth. If the parents are without sufficient 
means to have the child treated by oculist, dentist, or masseur, the 
cost is provided by the community. In most of the cities and larger 
towns, the schools arrange for baths and swimming for both boys 
and girls at suitable places in the open, and in the winter plunge 
baths and shower baths are provided indoors. The use of the baths 
is voluntary in most cases; their importance is so fully brought
-P-A-G-E-439

before pupils and parents that most children avail themselves of 
them regularly. 
In the summer children who are sick or in delicate health are taken 
into the country on some farm where they remain for a time under 
the supervision of teachers and matrons. The place for these ‘‘vaca- 
tion colonies,” as they call them, is selected with the view of securing 
fresh air, sea breezes, and nourishing food for the children. There 
is usually a remarkable improvement in the health and vigor of the 
children when they return from these outings. In 1914 Stockholm 
managed 73 such colonies taking care of 2,439 children. Private 
persons have contributed liberally for this kind of welfare work, and 
in Stockholm the annual interest on half a million crowns is available 
for these purposes. Gothenborg, Malmé, Halmstad, Hilsingborg, and 
other cities send out thousands of children to farms and forest camps 
to recuperate in this way. 
Again, upon the initiative of the MAGbnb! Teachers’ Association 
many communities have instituted travel clubs for school children. 
These provide funds and plan trips to the large centers and other 
places affording enjoyment and instruction. The Tourist Associa- 
tion, under whose auspices the trips are often made, usually secure 
reduced railroad fare for the children. 
As unsuitable and insufficient nourishment make it impossible for 
children to learn and develop at their best, many schools have taken 
this matter in hand by supplying free meals from the school kitchens, 
and, incidentally, furnishing the girls instruction in cooking. In 
some cases, too, they supply shoes and clothing to destitute pupils. 
In connection with many schools are workrooms to provide occu- 
pation for children in the afternoon and thereby keep them from 
idling on the streets. Here they are taught to mend their own clothes 
and shoes and, in general, to occupy themselves with sloyd, weaving, 
crocheting, knitting, carpentry, metal fashioning, and basket work. 
Teachers are always present to direct the work. The expenses are 
provided by allowances from the municipality, donations, annual 
fees, private contributions, and the sale of the childrens’ products. 
More than 75 such workrooms have been equipped in the villages 
and cities. 
The General Teachers’. Association, of Sweden, organized in 1860, 
has now a membership of about 12,000. Its subdivisions and com- 
mittces, some of them with considerable funds at their disposal, pur- 
sue assigned activities in the interests of schools and teachers. The 
literature committee attends to the publication of matters of edu- 
cational value. There are committees on syllabus and compendium 
for teachers, courses in drawing, school museum at Stockholm, 
traveling libraries, life insurance, and a Saga committee to publish 
 
-P-A-G-E-440
  440 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
suitable literature for the young. There is also a bureau of informa- 
tion to assist teachers in economic and legal matters. 
In 1906, a Women’s Teachers’ Association was organized. Its aim, 
as announced, is ‘‘to work for unity and cooperation among Sweden’s 
women teachers and to further educational and economic interests.” 
The association has its own school journals that work for these inter- 
ests. = 
RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
One of the most vital problems before the schools of Sweden at 
present is the proposed alteration in form and method of the religious 
instruction in the elementary schools. The present attempts to pre- 
pare new books as the basis for this subject are made in response to 
successive notions in the Riksdag appearing as early as 1903 and 
taken up again in almost every session from 1908 until the present. 
In 1911 a committee was appointed to prepare a textbook as a guide 
for the religious and moral (Sedeliran) instruction. Difficulties, 
partly anticipated and partly unexpected, arose, so that the com- 
mittee could not complete its work as early as intended. In 1916 
two editions were submitted, one for the elementary schools and one 
for the confirmation classes. The discussion that followed seemed to 
make sdill further alterations advisable; and the work is again in the 
hands of the board. 
The attempts thus made to alter the form of Luther’s Smaller 
Catechism cut deep into the religious traditions of the Swedish 
people, to whom this book has. been the means of imparting the 
rudiments of religious instruction for centuries. The criticism of the 
new version came from two opposite directions: (1) The conserva- 
tives in the State Church who find in it an unacceptable departure 
from the church traditions; and (2) the radical Socialists, who want 
neither the old catechism nor anything like it. Much earnest con- 
sideration has, however, been given to this problem by Sweden’s 
prominent churchmen and educators with the result that the new 
demands emerge in a clear light. ‘‘Religious truths,” they hold, 
“should be brought before the children, not in religious formulas nor 
in maxims of conduct, but in concrete life pictures taken from the 
Bible and from the history of the church. This mode of teaching 
does not exclude a general survey of the truths deduced and an 
ordering of these in synthetic statements.” 
STUDIES OF THE HOME LOCALITY. ‘ 
In the United States landmarks of historic interest, identified with 
the westward advance of the early settlers, are found from Cape Cod 
to San Diego. There are the vestiges of the settlers’ trails, the log 
cabin era, and the ruins of the temporary structures that were needed
-P-A-G-E-441
  SWEDEN. 441 
for maintenance and defense in those early times. When some one 
of sufficient enterprise collects material of this kind and proclaims the 
fact in print or by lectures there is usually a gratifying local response 
and appreciation of the effort, often resulting in endeavors to record 
or otherwise preserve whatever may enhance the prestige of the place. 
In Sweden this conception has taken the form of summer courses, 
mainly for teachers, given under the auspices of local organizations, 
and generally designated as studies in the home locality. In accord- 
ance with the underlying idea they set up as their aim, not primarily 
intellectual training of an academic character, but rather the purpose 
of rousing devotion to the home region, its interests and traditions. 
From the very first, then, the course included a study of early history 
and legends and whatever the place had to offer of antiquarian inter- 
est; later they came to include such features of the region as were 
significant for natural beauty and for this reason adapted to enhance 
its prestige; at a still later stage the resources and industrial pos- 
sibilities of the locality were brought within the scope of the lectures. 
Three distinct characteristics, due to the origin, have marked the 
work from the first: (1) The lectures are given during the summer, 
when nature is at her best; (2) they are held at central points in the 
locality to be studied; (3) they are conducted by teachers who have 
been brought up in the locality to be studied and who in consequence 
take a personal pride in their work. 
Their origin dates back a year or two prior to 1907, when at least 
eight Provinces in Sweden carried out programs of this kind. The 
work extended rapidly the following years until in 1917 it came to 
have a prominent place in vacation studies in all parts of the country, 
particularly in the south, where love of home surroundings is espe- 
cially strong. 
A typical instance of how these home locality courses start and 
develop is contained in an account of a meeting held in the city park 
at Simrishamn, on June 18, 1909, published in Vor Ungdom (Sep- 
tember, 1917). On thik occasion 300 persons effected a permanent 
organization for the study of the home locality, each member enrolled 
paying a fee of 5 crowns. A six-weeks’ session was held. Says Vor 
Ungdom: 
The forenoons were as a rule given up to lectures and the afternoons to excursions. 
Historic events of local import as well as prehistoric associations were discussed, in 
connection with an exhibition of relics from the Bronze Age. There was a lecture 
about the neighboring church, one about the history of the city, and another about 
life in a near-by city, Inglestad, during ancient times. One excursion was connected 
with talks on the local flora, another about the shale and lime formations, and one 
about the floral studies and the trips made by Linaeus in the vicinity; others dealt 
with the industries, among which fishing on the east coast of Skane received special 
attention. But in the entire series nothing made such an appeal as did the folk 
traditions and the folk songs.  
-P-A-G-E-442
442 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The course made use of the material contained in the city museums. 
A large and varied exhibition was provided showing ancient customs 
and equipments; and about one hundred volumes dealing with the 
locality were brought together. 
A report from the course in the Home Locality at Engelholm, in 
1912, shows that similar lines were followed. But here were no fewer 
than three exhibitions: (1) A gallery of paintings comprising 91 
numbers; (2) an exhibition showing the history of the place in its 
development; and (3) another in the articles of sloyd produced in 
this vicinity, in connection with which prizes were awarded. The 
formal lectures treated antiquarian and historical topics—the history 
of the city and country. The series included reminiscences of noted 
men connected with the place, also the substance of old sagas and 
traditions. The State geologist gave a survey of geological condi- 
tions thereabouts; followed by talks dealing with forestry, agricul- 
tural and industrial resources. The series was concluded by a fes- 
tival in which a conspicuous part was taken by a parade of knights 
in historic garb. Three counties were included; local banks provided 
a part of the expense; the Central Bureau for Popular Lectures con- 
tributed several hundred crowns. There were 222 participating 
members, 30 of them being teachers. 
Some of these courses have departed both in scope and direction 
from the original aims. In 1916 the programs of those given under 
the auspices of the National Teachers’ Association, while retaining 
the original feature of work in local interests, assumed the character 
of teachers’ institutes. Another class has enlarged its scope so as 
to include not only matters of local prestige but also natural history, 
lectures on languages, civil history, methods, and class-room practice. 
The organization that has brought these courses to their present 
advancement is Norrland’s Society for Locality Study, founded in 
1909. Its purpose is to gather funds for research in local history, to 
exploit this scientifically through library and school activities, and to 
disseminate knowledge about the province with the view of fostering 
love for home and country. The society has departments for 
archeological study, research in natural history, the study of pro- 
vincial dialects, folk music (registering songs and melodies), library 
matters, and'finally education. In a few years it has been able to 
collect specimens for a considerable museum, the expansion of an 
older collection—the numbers amounting to 9,000. In addition the 
members have an open-air museum comprising about 60 acres, from 
which is a magnificent view of the city, the surrounding country, and 
the sea. Here they have brought the buildings of a farmstead from 
Angermanland, a cattle shelter from Norway’s peculiar pasture high- 
lands, and a Russian tower of wood construction, with belfry. Then, 
too, they have completed a natural museum with a collection per-  
-P-A-G-E-443
  SWEDEN. 443 
taining to history, zoology, and geography, and a library about 
Norrland. In 1913 this library numbered 12,000 volumes. 
The educational means here provided have developed from the 
idea that the local parish school should bear, and be fitted ‘to impart, 
a clearer impress of the locality. Teachers coming from the training 
schools have not received anything there calculated to help toward 
such impression. With the view of ordering the work toward these 
ends, four groups of subjects were instituted: 
1. The natural history group: Geology and geography, to which 
later have been added surveying and map drawing, botany, zoology 
and meteorology. 
2. The philosophy group: Swedish language with paleography; 
the study of provincial dialects; anthropology. 
3. The historic group: The study of antiquity; Swedish history 
and sociology; statistics of history; local history. 
4. The pedagogical group: Psychology; the history and theory of 
education; technique of studies in the home locality. 
The plan of this work comprises lectures and exercises connected 
with excursions, all with the purpose not only of imparting informa- 
tion but of spurring the members on to independent study and 
research. Hence whoever wishes may apply for examination both 
in what he has formally gone through and what he has done inde- 
pendently. The total time of the course is four months, divided 
between two summer vacations. Four or five lectures, together with 
the exercises, constitute approximately the day’s work. It is 
expected that all the members will be teachers from the provinces. 
To carry into practical effect the plan thus outlined, it was found that 
more money was required than was at the disposal of the association, 
a difficulty temporarily overcome by receiving permission to use part 
of the funds for the advanced training of teachers. 
In this way the home locality course at Hiirnésand was started 
in June, 1914. The outbreak of the World War caused the work to 
be interrupted, so that a part of the plan had to be deferred until the 
following summer. But from that time until the present the work 
as begun has been maintained in steady activity. The number of 
those enrolled has grown until it includes not only people from Norr- 
land but also from other parts of the country. The regulations for 
admission require that the candidate shall have served as a teacher 
at least two years and that he be below the age of 45. 
The State aid which each member receives is somewhat less than in 
similar organizations in Denmark; there each one received 125 
crowns in 1915. Those who take part are paid one-half of the trav- 
eling expenses where they have more than 60 miles to come. On the 
other hand, the instructors receive higher pay in Sweden than in
-P-A-G-E-444
  444 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Denmark—-15 crowns for each lecture and 15 crowns for each double 
hour of laboratory work. Over and above this, instructors living at 
a distance from the district receive traveling expenses in full. The 
teachers who have participated are preparing outlines of all lectures 
and publishing them as handbooks for the work in its entirety. 
These are published by Norrland’s Association for Locality Study, 
and are of value for other forms of instruction besides those here 
discussed. 
This mode of school activity has occupied so conspicuous a place 
among Swedish school conceptions that educators have contem- 
plated making it the central unit in the projected university for sum- 
mer work. But the consideration came up that the very nature of 
the work requires that it be done in specific places and not at a central 
point remote from such localities. Hence the courses are coming to 
be established at community centers and to depend on these for 
expenses. The work they do for teachers is not primarily intended 
to remedy defects or inadequacies in training, but to supply an 
element of local inspiration and interest that teachers’ training 
schools have not yet attempted. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNAL MIDDLE SCHOOL. 
The modern (real) school created by the enactment of 1904 and 
providing a six-year course for children within the ages 9 to 15 has 
not, according to the opinion of school men in Sweden, altogether 
fulfilled its purpose of giving advanced instruction suited to posi- 
tions in general civil life. It was accessible only to pupils who lived 
in or near a larger city; it did not sustain any organic relation to 
the folk school except in so far as its first three classes could serve 
as preparation for entrance. Its real purpose was taken over and 
filled by private schools for boys and girls or by coeducational in- 
stitutions which, upon meeting specified stipulations, received State 
aid. 
In Sweden, as in Norway and Denmark, there has long been a 
movement in the direction of requiring the folk school to furnish 
the basic instruction needed for admission to secondary schools. 
This movement assumed legislative form in the Riksdag of 1908 in 
a proposition for State aid to communal middle schools. As this 
step was taken late in the session it did not come up for formal con- 
sideration till 1910, when State subvention was granted to this type 
of schools. One significant effect of the act was to enable smaller 
cities and even villages to establish a class of schools that would 
bring their pupils to a point of advancement equal to that of the 
modern school. Between the years 1910 and 1916 the number of   
1 Teachers’ and students’ handbooks, indicating the scope of this work with plan for presentingits subject 
matter, have already appeared, such as, “Handledning vid Undervisningen i Hembygdskunskap,” Parts 
Tand Il, by L. G. Sjéblom, Norstedt & Sons, Publishers, Stockholm.  
-P-A-G-E-445
  SWEDEN. : 445 
institutions of this class doubled, increasing from 15 to 31. In con- 
sequence of their rapid growth the State appropriation was, during 
the same period, increased from 10,000 to 100,000 crowns. 
Such schools are generally established by the reorganization of a 
former private coeducational school or a higher elementary school. 
As described in the order granting State aid— 
The communal middle school is an educational institution founded and main- 
tained by the community, aiming to impart such education for citizenship as the 
modern school emphasizes: it continues as a superstructure to the elementary school, 
and, with respect to entrance requirements, presupposes the advancement attained 
in the highest class of a fully equipped elementary school. It is to comprise four 
one-year classes above the elementary grades, each school year to consist of 38 weeks. 
At first thought it would seem as if its parallelism with the modern 
school would result in a wasteful duplication of types. When, how- 
ever, pupils who are expected to pursue advanced studies leave the 
public school, they are thought of as making a departure from the 
line of public-school continuity. They come under the charge of 
teachers who have had longer training; they are required to pay 
tuition fees; their associates come, in most cases, from homes a little 
better off economically, and they can hardly avoid the feeling of 
social differences. The communal middle school will furnish them 
the advanced instruction without any departure of this kind. 
In the communal middle school the schedule is more flexible, 
adapting itself more easily to local demands. The appended sched- 
ule comprises the two types, the four upper classes of the modern 
school with the four classes of the communal middle, giving the aver- 
age hours in the latter.

1 Lack of uniformity in the schedules of this type pees it necessary to reach an average in computing 
the hours, hence the fractions. 
Though the communal middle schools are under the control of 
the State supervisory board, which appoints their superintendents 
and inspectors, they are in other respects dependent only on the 
communities. The training of the teachers and their eligibility for 
 
-P-A-G-E-446
  446 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
appointment have elicited much discussion but have finally been 
embodied in regulations as follows: To be appointed as permanent 
teacher in any subject the applicant— 
(a) Shall meet the requirements for appointment as assistant or 
subject teacher of a State school, but that the time of service re- 
quired for such appointment may be substituted by service in a 
folk school. 
(6) Shall have passed through a normal school and continued at a 
communal middle school, higher folk school, or a similar institution. 
(c) Shall have studied the middle-school branches at the uni- 
versity and received good grades or passed the teachers’ examination 
with good grades or in some other way acquired educational efficiency. 
These regulations are to be in force until the question about the 
further development of the folk school shall have received a satis- 
factory solution. The communal middle schools may be organized 
either for one sex or as coeducational. 
Their influence on the school system as a whole is already apparent; 
they have made it possible for the folk school to move on more 
directly toward educational aims in this country associated with 
scholarly prestige; they have made the connection between the ele- 
mentary and the modern school closer, with the possible result that 
in the near future many of the six-year modern schools will be reor- 
ganized in accordance with their plan. 
THE OBLIGATORY CONTINUATION SCHOOL. 
A movement parallel with the foregoing has also been in progress 
for years and has finally resulted in the enactment of a law creating 
an obligatory continuation school. On May 8, 1918, the Riksdag 
passed a bill providing for such extension of the scope of the folk 
school as would bring Swedish youth to a further stage of educational] 
advancement; the courses of instruction to be devised with special 
view to the needs of present social and economic life. The far- 
reaching changes and modifications involved in putting into effect 
the details of this law are to be carried out so as to be in full effect 
by the end of 1924. The State Supervisory Board has issued a compen- 
dium for teachers and school authorities, instructing them in the 
operation of the law and in the manner of effecting the changes 
contemplated. 
The aim of the statute is the organization of a superstructure to 
the folk school to give young men and women vocational and civic 
instruction. It is a part of the aim already set up by teachers and 
philanthropic organizations; namely, to make use of the trades and 
occupations to keep the young in law-abiding and moral walks of life. 
The young man who acquires a trade or other vocational fitness has 
 
-P-A-G-E-447
we SWEDEN. 447 
not only thereby gained security for the future but he will also gain 
inducements toward correct living. 
Touching the continuation school two principles are kept in mind 
as basic: To furnish training that will lead to the mastery of a trade, 
and to advance the folk school subjects to fuller completion. The 
higher folk school also comprised in the provisions of the statute 
will be a parallel type, with the advantage of a longer period of 
instruction and more comprehensive courses. It will be adapted for 
children who, after finishing the folk scheol, have the opportunity of 
giving some further time to their schooling. Like the other kind, 
this will also be organized as of two types: One with a trade in view, 
the other for general training. In accordance with special local 
needs and conditions it will comprise one, two, three, or four years, 
with 36 weeks a year. 
The continuation school comprising a two-year period will be 
obligatory for all pupils who complete the elementary school without 
taking up studies in a school of some other kind. It is to have, as a 
rule, 180 instruction hours a year. The State appropriates the full 
amount of salaries for the: teachers, but the community furnishes 
buildings and instruction material. The courses lead to the trade 
schools, also comprising two years, with 6 to 12 hours’ instruction a 
week. The departments which the trade schools are to embrace 
will be of four classes: A school for industry, a school for trades and 
artisans, a school for commerce, a school for household work. The 
law recognizes the need of subordinate branches under each class and 
leaves the greatest freedom for such specialization as each calling or 
each locality may require. So far as the household work is con- 
cerned, it is for the first time placed on a level with other trades in 
respect to credits. It is made accessible to all girls who are not 
employed in some trade, industry, or business, or who are not receiv- 
ing instruction of a kind equivalent to the trade school. 
While these schools are made obligatory for the pupils, they are 
not for the communities for the reason that many of the latter are 
unable to bear the expense that the founding of such schools would 
entail. As the trade school will be attended by pupils above the 
elementary school years, many of them will be employed in the 
trades during the period of attendance. For this reason, their 
employers are required to release them from their duties for periods 
sufficient to participate in the instruction. The State contributes 
two-thirds of the teachers’ salaries and from one-half to two-thirds 
of the expense of maintenance, while the community provides the 
buildings and the rest of the expense for maintenance. 
In order to prepare the teachers and specialists needed to take 
charge of the work, advanced technical training schools and gymnasia 
are to be established. For the early imstruction, business schools 
 
-P-A-G-E-448
    448 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
will be started, connecting in their advanced courses with the com- 
mercial gymnasia already existing. The nature of the work is such 
that teachers who have both educational and technical training will 
be required. : 
There are already many continuation schools in Sweden, some 
private, others public, that have practical instruction in the trades 
as their aim. Many of these are excellently equipped through the 
munificence of private donors, The law just passed will, however, 
extend vocational instruction to all the children of the community. 
Its full effects will appear in added facilities for the work in recon- 
struction in which each community will have a share after the war. 
Further reforms in prospect.—Though the provisions for new educa- 
tional facilities created by the laws of 1908 and 1918 were timely, 
the educational press of Sweden is discussing still further reforms. 
Several problems rise immediately out of the relations the communal 
middle schools and the obligatory continuation schools are to sustain 
to existing school types. As early as 1913 and 1915 there were 
intimations in the Riksdag that State aid for schools duplicating each 
other’s work could not be expected. The question, moreover, as to 
how the modern school subserves its purposes has become prominent. 
It is pointed out that its final examination comes so early in the life 
of the pupils that they are not mature enough for the promotions 
and positions for which this examination is intended to be the quali- 
fying test—admission to schools specializing in agriculture, technology, 
postal and telegraph training, positions in the railway and banking 
service. Again, the schools for the education of girls need reforms 
with, the view of reducing the expenses of attendance and making it 
possible for the teachers to become better prepared, and in general 
for transferring the instruction from the private schools to those of 
the State. 
Further development in the system must, in consequence, have 
regard to the relation among the various types; it must secure a 
better ordering of the education of girls; it must reconsider proposi- 
tions earlier laid before the Riksdag about additional main lines of 
study in the gymnasium as well as of the articulation between this 
type of school and the preparatory schools from which it continues. 
The advocates of these reforms have in mind, evidently, the basic 
principles of the uniform school (Enhetsskolan), which requires 
organic and direct continuity between institutions of different 
degrees of advancement with the folk school as their common basis 
and preparation. They emphasize the further principle that the 
work in the secondary schools should be grouped in courses such that 
only those best endowed are induced to select work leading to the 
advanced high schools and the university. With the same purpose 
of selecting the best gifted for higher studies, admission to the
-P-A-G-E-449
  SWEDEN. 449 
gZymnasium should be made dependent on natural endowments, 
whereby an undesirable increase in those immatriculating in the 
advanced institutions would be counteracted. The practical re- 
forms already carried out in the communal middle schools and the 
obligatory continuation schools will assist in the further reforms 
here mentioned, which are mainly the theoretical completion of the 
former. 
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES APART FROM THE SCHOOLS. 
Much educational work is conducted by teachers’ associations and 
other groups outside of the scheduled work of the schools. These 
organizations are generally well established, and are usually supported 
by funds from the State or by the income from endowments. Their 
activity is not at all limited to the occasions of their periodical 
sessions or to the business that rises immediately from these, but 
they are organized with permanent offices, with the view of attending 
at any time to such matters as come within their scope. A few of 
these organizations in Sweden are the following: j 
The Society for Physical Training. Founded in 1913, and in 1914 united with the 
Swedish Society for Open Air Games and Health Education. It receives a State 
subyention of 1,000 crowns a year. Its purpose is to work for rational physical 
training. Address, Stockholm.

activity. Some of the foremost educators are on its directing board. It has a mem- 
bership of about 14,000 and funds to the amount of about 70,000 crowns. In the 
course of its work, the association has developed so that it is now divided into a number 
of permanent bureaus and committees, each made up of specialists within the field 
assigned to it: (a) The literature bureau, with a membership of about 650, attends 
to the editing and publishing of educational publications. (6) The editorial com- 
mittee prepares handbooks for teachers. (c) A special committee plans and directs 
courses in drawing. (d) A committee plans and manages courses in singing. (e) A 
special committee has charge of the school museum at Stockholm. (f) A Saga com- 
mittee cooperates with a publishing house in Stockholm in collecting and publishing 
suitable literature for children and the young. (g) A committee has charge of the 
disposition and use of the traveling libraries. (h) A committee on school excursions 
plans and manages visits of pupils and teachers to other schools and other countries. 
(i) A board of economics has charge of the finances of the association. (j) The informa- 
tion committee confers with, advises, and helps teachers in economical and legal 
matters. (k) A life insurance committee advises teachers and looks after their life 
insurance interests. (J) The correspondence committee has the duty of bringing 
about suitable cooperation with teachers’ associations of other countries, 
Through these several branches the association takes the initiative in educational 
endeavors, conducts discussions, issues reports, and formulates educational measures 
for the consideration of the State supervisory board. In this way it has, for instance, 
done efficient work in the interest of the higher folk schools and in securing the enact- 
ment for obligatory attendance at a continuation school. The 15,000 crowns allowed 
by the Riksdag for teachers’ continuation courses is due to the efforts of the associa- 
tion. By means of this sum the association has established teachers’ libraries, teachers’ 
courses in drawing, singing, and courses in practical labor. Besides instituting 
lecture series in studies in the home locality in several centers, the association is 
cooperating with the State supervisory board in efforts to secure a normal plan for 
locality study. 
During 1913 the association conducted an investigation on the condition of the 
pupils’ health. It found that certain steps toward ameliorating the conditions 
should at once be taken, and immediately submitted requests to the schoo) com- 
mittee on the care of the pupils’ teeth. In its official organ it has combated the use 
of tobacco among pupils; it has caused the privileges of the pupils’ health colonies 
to be more generally extended to children in poor health, 
‘The association has accomplished much for its members and for the schools in 
general in campaigning for adequate salary increase in view of the high prices of 
recent years, and also in encouraging teachers to remain at their posts of duty instead 
of accepting tempting offers of more remunerative employment,

GENERAL SURVEY OF THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. 
Administrative boards representing both the church and the state 
exercise control and supervision over the schools of Denmark. The 
State adopts the regulations governing programs and courses, the 
length of the school year, and the distribution of the vacations; it 
provides the facilities for the training of teachers, passes on petitions 
for grants and subventions, and attends to the general management 
of all the economic matters of the schools. 
In the several communes, local school matters are dealt with by 
parish commissions. In the cities the commission consists of the 
pastor, the mayor, and two or three lay members; in the rural dis- 
tricts it is made up of the pastor and one or two lay members. 
Through these authorities the communes exercise a degree of super- 
vision and inspection that in other countries is usually vested in 
officials of the State. Immediately above the parish boards stands 
the county council with its school direction, whose chief function is 
to appoint teachers from lists supplied by the parish and to have 
charge of the apportionment of teachers’ remuneration and pensions. 
Through the ex officio position of pastors and bishops the school 
stands in close relation to the church. In each diocese the bishop 
visits the schools and informs himself directly concerning their edu- 
cational needs, how teachers and school boards are attending to their 
duties, etc. 
The status of religious instruction is a subject of recurrent dis- 
cussion in the journals of education. The law as it reads now per- 
mits exemption from instruction in the case of children whose parents 
do not belong to the state church, on the condition, however, that 
they in some other way receive equivalent knowledge of general 
moral and religious truths.!' In order to give the teacher freedom 
in conducting the recitation, no formal examinations are required 
in this subject and no grades are issued. 
In former years it was held as self-evident that the schools should 
teach religion as the foundation for training in moral stability of 
character. But later views insist that pupils should be left inde- 
pendent of the problems of religion and that the subject should be 
taught as a part of general history, leaving purely religious instruc- 
tion to the church and the home. The majority of teachers, how- 
ever, hold that instruction as hitherto conducted should be main- 
tained, even though many of them would gladly be independent of 
the ecclesiastical supervision now exercised over their work.

452 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The first compulsory school law was passed in 1814. As modified 
by later enactments now in effect, it requires children to attend from 
7 to 14 years of age, the period comprised in the elementary school. 
In the event of privation or sickness prevailing in the home, a pupil 
may be excused from attendance at school. A formal release from 
attendance may also be granted before the expiration of the required 
school period. The responsibility for granting such excuses for 
nonattendance rests solely with the school commission. 
These regulations have been so strictly enforced that there is vir- 
tually no illiteracy. A careful record of absences is kept and reported, 
and when they are not accounted for in a satisfactory way fines are 
collected. For the year 1914 the sum of 15,000 crowns! was thus 
collected in Copenhagen. In other cities and in rural communities 
the sum thus brought in amounted to 79,000 crowns. 
The length of the school year is 41 to 46 weeks, about 246 days. 
The local board determines the proportion of whole and half days 
per week in the district, often making it four whole days and two 
half days in winter, and three whole days and three half days in 
summer. The number of hours required per week is a minimum of 
21, not counting gynmastics, drawing, manual training, sloyd, and 
household work for women. The regulations also fix the maximum 
number of pupils in a class as 37 for schools in the country and 35 
in the city. 
At the age of 11 the pupil may enter on a four-year course in the 
intermediate school (Mellemskole) with one year extra for those who 
desire to prepare for the modern school (realskole) examination, 
which admits the pupils to the gymnasium. The gymnasium offers 
courses along three lines: The classival, the modern language, and the 
mathematical-scientific. School reforms now under consideration 
propose to reduce these lines by the omission of the classical, includ- 
ing its subjects under one of the two remaining ones. The same 
trend in the secondary schools moves in the direction of giving more 
time to the study of English and German by omitting Latin. How 
the status of German will be affected by the war is not clear nor 
can it readily be forecast from the reports that are at hand. 
There are 48 gymnasia, of which 8 offer all three lines, 29 offer 
2, and 11 only 1. The total number of secondary schools in 1912— 
commercial, private, and State—was 218, of which 146 were coedu- 
cational, while 32 were exclusively for boys and 40 for girls. Tuition 
in the intermediate school is 120 crowns per year; in the gymnasium 
it is 150 crowns.   
1A crown is equal to 26 cents,

In response to the demand for practical training for those who 
have completed the elementary course, a number of trade schools, 
continuation schools, and evening schools have sprung up. As the 
pupils of these are generally wage-earners, many trade schools have 
the schedule of hours so arranged that a pupil may take up selected 
studies without discontinuing his regular employment in the factory 
or the shop. The attempt has therefore been made to extend the 
schedule so as to make use of the evening hours, giving rise to a 
considerable number of evening schools. For 1912 there were 798 
throughout the country. But as the teachers of these schools and 
the pupils that attend them are employed during the day, it has been 
felt that other forms of continuation schools offer better working 
conditions. Again, the evening schools, by stressing almost exclu- 
sively the remunerative side’ of the occupation in which the pupil 
is engaged, do not respond to the need for more cultural activity, 
which asserts itself, even in these practical associations. 
The objections against permitting the pupils to give a part of 
their time to remunerative work have not been overlooked. In 1908 
an investigation by Denmark’s Statistical Bureau showed that of a 
total of 370,440 children 45,512 worked certain hours a day for 
parents and guardians and that 65,397 had employment with others, 
hence less than one-third of the pupils had to perform labor not con- 
nected with school assignments. In so far as the investigation was 
completed, it did not substantiate the supposition that pupils em- 
ployed under the child-labor regulations were thereby handicapped 
in health, development, or progress. 
One class of institutions in Denmark has attracted the attention 
of the whole world, namely, the peoples’ high schools, which, together 
with the agricultural schools, have greatly advanced the farming 
classes in prosperity and prestige. In Copenhagen is a veterinary 
school of high rank. There are professional schools for medicine, 
dentistry, and pharmacy; also noted technological and navigation 
schools. The Academy of Fine Arts and the Conservatory of Music 
rank high among institutions of their kind. 
The University of Copenhagen comprises the faculties of theology, 
law, medicine, philosophy, science, and mathematics. The number 
of students, including those regularly matriculated and others, is 
upwards of 3,000. Its courses run through periods of 5 to 6 years. 
It is a center of research and scientific activity, which already numbers 
many scientists who have made momentous contributions in their 
several fields. In the United States these names are well known: 
Meyer in medicine, Lorenz in physics, Thomsen in chemistry, H6ff- 
ding in philosophy and psychology, and Brandes in literature and 
criticism,

THE NATIONAL POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
This institution, ranking with the university in scope and advance- 
ment, has given direction to much of the scientifically constructive 
work in the northern countries. In 1918 it had a faculty of 46 pro- 
fessors, 39 instructors and 25 assistants, with a number of laboratory 
and machine shop assistants and attendants. Broadly speaking, 
the instruction embraces four departments with groups of courses in 
factory engineering, mechanical engineering, architectural engineer- 
ing, and electrical engineering. To complete the work in any one 
of these lines, requires four and one-half years. The subjects taught 
include all those connected with theoretical and applied science. 
Counting the courses taught by lectures, the series of experiments 
and laboratory exercises, the number of subject, units offered during 
1918 amounted to about 600. A few of them are: Architecture 
and iron and steel construction; ship building; road building; house 
building; electrotechnics; heating and ventilation; municipal hygiene 
engineering; technical chemistry; machine testing; testing of ma- 
terials; planning factory plants; theory of dynamic motion; theory of 
experimentation, in which the most common methods of making 
experiments in physics are explained; courses for workers and 
specialists in machine construction and factory engineering; chemistry 
for specialists in mineralogy and geology; technical chemistry applied 
in the study of fertilizers; glass composition and characteristics, 
melting and decoration; reducing ores and the extraction of chief 
products and by-products; distillation of peat deposits; purification 
and manufacture into gases and oils; and agricultural bacteriology; 
nitrogen-producing bacteria. These are only a few of the remarkably 
comprehensive list of courses. 
Anyone who can give satisfactory evidence of being prepared: to 
profit by the work is admitted. To register for examination, how- 
ever, certain specified preparatory subjects are required. The cost 
of instruction, including laboratory facilities, is 50 crowns per 
semester for those registering for examination. The fee for a course 
of one lecture per week is usually three crowns per semester; for a 
greater number of lectures and laboratory hours the charges are at 
proportionate rates. 
Recently a new degree has been instituted, that of Doctor of 
Technics, conferred on those who successfully pass the final examina- 
tion and whose written theses are accepted. Foreign students, who 
present sufficient evidence of having completed the prerequisite 
studies and of being engaged in scientific researches approved by 
the authorities, may enroll for this degree. 
Any one holding the degree of Doctor of Technics has the right 
to offer courses of lectures at the Polytechnic Institute after appli- - 
cation in accordance with the rules of the institution.
-P-A-G-E-455

A number of funds have been provided for the purpose of encourag- 
ing students to enter this institution. The American-Scandinavian 
Foundation of New York has liberal funds available for persons 
taking up studies in this or any other institution in the Scandinavian 
countries. 
THE PEOPLE’S HIGH SCHOOL. 
These institutions have long had the attention of educators from 
many countries. They have been regarded as one of the chief 
agencies that helped Denmark to recover from the disastrous wars 
of 1864-1866. To them, in a large measure, is due the achievement 
of making the meager soil of the country so produétive as to raise 
the farming population from privation to a fair degree of comfort, 
The model farms, the dairying and packing-house industries, which 
have become the pattern for other countries, have been set down to 
their credit. Educators of the war-stricken countries will find in 
these institutions not only efficiency in the usual sense, but some 
of the basic elements that make for recovery and reconstruction. 
The system of schools.—Though something may be credited to. the 
system, as will be pointed out, the obvious achievements of the 
schools are mainly due to other causes. They have no class-room 
procedures that can be considered superior to the other schools of 
this country. Their teachers are not better trained; their experi- 
mental and laboratory facilities are not more ample. The agri- 
cultural schools are just as practical, and they do many things 
better. The vocational and trade schools are more direct in the 
insistence on the productive application of what is learned. The 
well-equipped technological institutions of Denmark supply better 
training in more advanced courses. 
But the system establishes a relation between the pupil and the 
instruction that in itself promotes achievement. At the age of 14, 
or earlier, the pupil leaves the elementary school, usually to take a 
position as an apprentice in one of the trades or as an employee on 
afarm. During several years of the adolescent period he is employed 
in manual work, attaining development of body and also some 
definiteness of purpose. Most of all his experiences, often under a 
severe taskmaster, create in him a desire to lift himself above the 
restrictions in which he toils. Then at the age of 18, or later, he 
may enter the Peoples’ High School to improve his opportunities, 
and he then readily meets the one entrance condition the institution 
imposes, namely, a desire to learn. 
Where he sees an opening for useful work, he does not feel ham- 
pered by degrees or ends to be attained in the final examination. 
Older people may come to the high school to get information per- 
taining to some line of work they have in hand, and stay during the 
 
-P-A-G-E-456
    456 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
days or weeks necessary to obtain the full aid of the school. This 
adaptable character makes it possible to take cognizance not only 
of the special needs of a group of farmers or fishermen, but of such 
particular conditions as govern the industries of any locality. 
The spirit of the schools.—It is claimed that they have discovered 
the way to educate the young men back to the farms, and, if this 
be true, it is worth while to note how they do it. Some main causes 
are principal and some are contributory. In the first place, all 
their courses and experiments are associated with the sense of the 
dignity of labor. They teach, not caste, nor self-conscious pride 
that looks for contrasts and distinctions, but a simple love for the 
farm, the forest, and the sea—the dignity of the farmer’s occupation, 
let other occupations be what they may. 
The schools begin their recitations with songs, thereby investing 
the work with a zest that could not easily be obtained in any other 
way. This practice perhaps furnishes a psychological stimulus to 
the students and aids cooperative effort. Poetry and singing, in 
fact, lie close to all they do in the classroom as well as in the eve- 
ning voluntaries. The students take their poets earnestly, seriously, 
. while we, too often, only tolerate them. But poetry prepares the 
way for the Danish high school teacher to impress his pupils with 
a sense of individual moral responsibility, which is the only real 
basis on which cooperative work can be accomplished. People must 
trust each other and be able to turn aside from their own advantage 
and manifest an interest in others and the cause, if banking or market- 
ing cooperation is to be successful. It is not some one’s technica] 
skill or grasp that makes such an enterprise possible but rather the 
spirit that pervades it. 
We are accustomed to treat our school subjects strictly according 
to their character. Whatever is matter-of-fact is dealt with as such 
without any attempts to idealize it. We relegate sentiment to what 
is held to be its own proper place. But in the Danish schools geo- 
graphy, sociology, poetry, and love of country come into very human 
relations during the school hour. These schools are able consist- 
ently to deal with the main subject in its proper character without 
losing sight of its points of human connection. 
As the principal facts about these institutions are readily available, 
it may suffice merely to mention that there are about 80 such schools 
in Denmark, about 45 in Sweden, and 24 in Norway. They are 
started by public-spirited members of a community, who call a mass 
meeting, and raise the necessary funds by subscription. Afterwards 
the schools are accredited by the State and receive State aid. They

give a six months’ course in the winter for young men, and a five 
months’ course in the summer for young women. In some of these 
institutions the courses cover two years; in others, one year. Worthy 
students receive State aid. An inspector visits them and reports on 
the work. The Government, however, does not interfere with the 
arrangement of subjects, courses, or hours, but satisfies itself with 
knowing that there are devoted teachers and authorities and permits 
them to go on without interference. 
SCHOOL EXCURSIONS. 
School journeys have become a part of the year’s program in most 
schools. They are the realization of a principle which is gaining the 
general approval of educators in this country. Teachers and pupils, 
it is held, find some of their best opportunities for training and 
instruction in material lying outside of books and classrooms. 
Every autumn, toward the middle of September, there is an 
excursion of two days for the boys of from 10 to 12 years, accompanied 
by a few of the larger boys, who make it as a final trip. These in- 
struct the younger ones in the details of the journey, help in the dis- 
cipline of the party, and encourage their younger companions in 
endurance while on the march, so that the latter may be trained to 
take part in the grand excursion coming later. If a pupil should 
show himself much fatigued by the trip, he is not permitted to take 
part in the later excursions. One of these comes in the spring and 
lasts seven days; another during the summer vacation and lasts from 
three to four weeks. 
Usually there are about 30 or 40 pupils in the party and three or 
four teachers, the number taking part in the shorter trips being, 
however, considerably greater. As preparation, the pupils are in- 
structed in the route with the map before them and otherwise helped to 
be benefited by what they are likely to see. They prepare a guide 
pamphlet of their own, with maps, descriptions, and also regulations 
to be observed while en route. Each pupil is required to keep a day- 
book, both for purposes of gaining clearer impressions and for 
acquiring a souvenir of the trip. A fine is imposed on those who do 
not observe the regulations and a prize awarded to the one who 
furnishes the best description. Each pupil carries a knapsack with 
his equipment and also provisions for a week, if the trip is to last that 
long. A day’s march is often 37 kilometers (23 miles)—sufficiently 
long, as it would seem. Every two or three hours they rest an hour 
by some spring or stream, lunch, bathe, or, at least, take a foot bath. 
Toward 6 o’clock the party halts at a hotel and takes dinner or 
supper, usually a frugal meal. At 9 o’clock everybody is expected to 
be in his room, where he may not talk so as to disturb others, though 
he may converse quietly, and write letters or write the day’s account
-P-A-G-E-458
  458 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
in his diary. The program indicates the hour for breakfast, and it 
rests with each one to get up and appear in time, for the members of 
the party are often lodged at different hotels. 
For a trip of two days the expense of each pupil is 4 or 5 crowns 
a day; for the longer summer journeys, it is about 5 crowns a day. 
The journeys are not limited to Denmark, but include railway and 
steamship trips to Norway, Sweden, Vienna, Berlin, Milan, etc. 
Everything is carefully planned in advance, so as to reduce the ex- 
pense. 
The places included in the itinerary are those that afford an interest 
from the point of view of history or nature, so that the teachers may 
connect them with what the pupils do at school. In foreign countries 
practice in speaking the vernacular is eagerly sought. Visits are made 
to industrial establishments and operations and processes are ex- 
plained. Notes are kept on the places visited, history, life of the 
people, natural resources, markets, etc., which are afterwards worked 
up into papers and essays. Teachers find that ona trip pupils show 
much greater interest than while on the benches of the classroom. On 
their part, too, pupils learn to know and to appreciate their teachers 
better. 
Of a similar order are children’s vacation journeys, originally in- 
tended to give poor children of the cities the advantage of a few weeks 
in the country. Every year about 25,000 boys and girls from the 
schools of Copenhagen, Frederiksborg, and Aarhus obtain free trans- 
portation by railroad or steamboat to the country to pass four or five 
weeks with families who extend hospitality to them. Usually the 
parents of the children make arrangements with some family willing 
to receive them during vacation, but a great many are furnished 
accommodations and entertainment through the efforts of the schools. 
At a certain time of the year the children inform the principal of their 
wish to spend some time in the country, of the place they desire to 
visit, and possibly the family with whom they would like to stay. 
The principal takes these suggestions into consideration, and with 
the assistance of the other school authorities prepares a list of the 
names to be submitted to the railroad or steamship companies with a 
request for the necessary tickets. These tickets are sent to the 
schools. The companies run special vacation trains carrying the 
children to their summer destinations. In order to reciprocate, the 
people of Copenhagen have formed a “Society for Entertaining Chil- 
dren from the Provinces.” This society has met with great success. 
In recent years 163 village schools with more than 8,000 pupils have 
been benefited by its work. The transportation companies have 
been accommodating and generous. The stay in Copenhagen is at 
the expense of the society, which receives a subvention of 4,000 
crowns from the city of Copenhagen and lesser sums from other cities.

TEACHERS’ TRAINING, SALARIES, AND STATUS. 
Teachers of the elementary schools are trained in the normal 
schools, of which there are 4 public and 15 private, offering three- 
year courses. Tuition at the private normal schools is 150 crowns a 
year. To be admitted the applicant must be at least 18 years of 
age. The teachers in the State secondary schools are educated at 
the university. Examination in specified academic subjects are 
required; then follows the special pedagogical training with practice 
teaching in some school approved by the university. 
As new subjects have been added to the curricula and new types of 
schools developed, there has come to be an insistent demand for 
better training of teachers. It is not complete enough, the critics say; 
it includes no instruction in a foreign language, and, in general, it is 
too limited in view of the rapidly expanding field of education, both 
in practical and theoretical directions. Again, the teachers’ colleges 
have too decidedly an academic character. The discussion of inade- 
quacies of this kind have thus far led only to the regulation of 1913 
requiting a strict entrance examination for admission to these insti- 
tutions. By means of special courses in methods and practices the 
teachers have, through their individual efforts, tried to keep abreast 
of the progress made in their profession. 
While the teachers’ compensation, here as elsewhere, has been inade- 
quate during the recent years of high prices, requiring special enact- 
ments for an emergency increase, the laws provide a fair competence 
during normal years. Here as in other Scandinavian countries the 
salaries and the eventual pensions are so regulated that a position 
means a certain salary, with periodical increases and, upon attaining 
the age limit, a retiring allowance. As a prerequisite for an appoint- 
ment that places him in line for this remuneration, the applicant 
must have passed the teacher’s examination and served successfully 
as a teacher during four years. 
The prospect of a periodical increase in salary and a final retiring 
competence induces the teacher to look upon his calling, not as a 
stepping stone to something more desirable, but as alife work. He 
is also relieved, in a measure, of the petty annoyances of having to 
negotiate with local boards from time to time. Successive enact- 
ments have had the effect of placing the salaries on the basis of the 
needs and comforts which a person in the position of a teacher may 
reasonably expect. In a general way the remuneration is higher in 
Sweden, counting the successive increments for years of service. In 
all the Scandinavian countries there are, over and above the yearly 
pay, tree home, garden, and fuel or the money equivalents ot these. 
An interesting and significant part of the salary laws is the considera- 
tion given for length of service.
-P-A-G-E-460
460 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Through the courtesy of Supt. Holger Begtrup, of the People’s | 
High Schoot at Frederiksborg, Denmark, the salary regulations now 
in effect, together with special enactments for 1919, are at hand. The 
fixed annual salary has for a number of years past been as follows: 
‘For a rural teacher in the first salary class 900 to 1,500 crowns plus 
the teacher’s home, garden plot, and fuel, with successive increments, 
which in the course of 20 years raise the salary to 1,900-2,500 
crowns, For a rural teacher in the second salary class, 700-900, plus 
home, garden, and fuel, increasing in the course of 20 years to 1,700- 
1,900 crowns. Women teachers in primary grades (in rural districts), 
500-700 crowns. ‘Teachers in the cities of the provinces receive a 
basic salary of 1,600 crowns, increasing in 20 years to 3,000. Women 
teachers in the cities of the provinces, basic salary 1,500 crowns, 
increasing in 20 years to 2,000. A teacher in Copenhagen receives 
1,800 crowns, gradually increasing to 3,600. 
Besides the municipal “high-expense bonus,” which, in places 
where it is granted, amounts to 100-200 crowns annually, the State, 
has during the same years also granted a high-expense bonus. It is 
paid to teachers under the civil-service enactment of 1917 and amounts 
to the following sums for 1918: Six hundred crowns for a married 
teacher and 400 for a single teacher, in no case, however, to exceed 
60 per cent of the current salary. This addition to the teacher’s 
salary has been further increased by recent enactments adding 120 
crowns to a married teacher’s salary for 1919. 
This law then fixes the remuneration of a teacher in the cities for 
1919 at the current annual salary increased by 25 per cent, plus 720 
crowns for a married teacher (500 for unmarried teachers). To illus- 
trate: A married teacher in the lowest salary class in the cities will 
receive for 1919, 1,600 crowns plus 400 plus 720, hence a total of 2,720 
crowns. A married teacher in the highest salary class in the cities will 
receive for 1919, 3,000 crowns plus 750 crowns plus 720, hence’a total 
of 4,470. 
For 1919 a special addition will be made to the pensions of teachers, 
widows, or orphans entitled to annual stipends or pensions. Accord- 
ing to paragraph 9, the bonus to be paid will be 25 per cent of the 
pension, provided this amounts to 2,000 crowns or more; 30 per cent 
in case the pension is 1,000 to 2,000; 35 if it is between 700 and 1,000, 
and 40 per cent if it is below 700; yet the bonus must in no case be 
less than 240 crowns. Again, the pension and the bonus together 
in any of these cases must not be less than that to which a person 
with lower pension may be entitled. 
In attempting to follow the work of the elementary teacher closely 
enough to see what particular phases of it he emphasizes, the following 
facts will be noted:  
-P-A-G-E-461
  DENMARK. 461. 
1. Wherever possible the elementary teacher leads his pupils to a 
point of physical connection with what has been intéllectually ac- 
quired. Excellent instruction material, he believes, is found in the 
physical properties of earth and air, plants and animals, local 
resources, traffic, and commercial relations. The pupils have a keen 
desire to see things, a characteristic to which the teacher can appeal, 
causing them, for instance, to watch the growth of a sprouting plant, 
by starting—it may be on a very modest scale—an aquarium or a 
herbarium. By bringing a bit of nature into the school, new im- 
pulses will be imparted to the children. 
2. The Danish teacher stresses the unity and organized form of the 
subject matter. In the advanced elementary class the topic, for 
instance, may be Holland and her transformation from a stretch of 
coastal marshes to a region of fields, downs, and pasture lands. 
Following this in its development the struggle of the people will come 
into view, their means of subsistence and the causes that started the 
industries of the country and gave it its very appearance at the 
present day. In close association come topics about life in various 
parts of the country. In brief, Holland as a unit, an individuality, 
is presented with various aspects of life and development in causal 
relations, and all without attempts at speculative conclusions. 
3. The Danish teacher insists on the cooperation of the parents. 
He endeavors to bridge the chasm between the school and the home 
by informing the parents by direct and honest statements just how 
their children are getting along. The reports of the standing of the 
pupils in the school, issued at fixed intervals, tell the story of the 
children’s progress only in part. They do not come so closely home 
to the parents as the full explanations which are also furnished at 
fixed periods. The following are typical examples of the latter 
taken from Vor Ungdom: 
_ In English X has shown diligence and interest; he has acquired a more correct pro- 
nunciation and better expression in his reading. But his progress is not as yet satis- 
factory. He is yet unskilled in English phonetics and in English spelling. He lacks 
readiness in the use of language, but he is fairly sure in grasping the correct gram- 
matical construction of an English sentence, and he has fair ability to render it in 
Danish. By continued diligence he will overcome the difficulties the subject 
presents. 
The progress made by Y in the German language is not very satisfactory; he lacks 
the power of combining expressions. (He translates the words by rote in the German 
word order.) His imagination is hampered so that in a connection where he knows all 
the words but one and the meaning of this one is fully clear from the context, he can 
not translate it. His eye does not sharply catch the words of the text, hence he con- 
stantly confuses w and v, ei and ie. He has difficulty in retaining what he has once 
learned, both words and grammar forms. He deserves praise for the interest and 
diligence he has shown, but he should be impressed with the need of working with 
greater concentration. In some respects he has made fair progress; his vocabulary 
has increased; and his knowledge of grammar and his pronunciation have improved. 
While his general advance must be stated as hardly satisfactory, the fact must not be 
forgotten that he has studied German only one year.

The general supervision and inspection exercised over the teacher’s 
work have been the subjects of considerable criticism. In his recent. 
book, ‘The History of the Danish Public Schools” (1918), Joakim 
Larsen speaks of the “school supervision as virtually the same as 
that found antiquated 100 years ago, notwithstanding the fact that. 
both teachers and schools have become entirely different.” Many 
teachers hold that the independence of the schools requires that the 
supervision should be exercised by men from their own midst. Both 
as regards the administration and the supervision, teachers as well as. 
clergymen are of the opinion that they lack the immediate authority 
found in most other countries. The Government commission of 1909 
recommended that a supervisor should be appointed for each district. 
and that he should take the place of the rector on the local board. 
The recommendation was not acted upon lest it should restrict the 
independence of the municipal board; again, some of the clergy saw 
in the proposed reform the beginning of the separation of the school 
from the church. 
ARTICULATION BETWEEN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Among the questions at present much discussed in school circles is 
how to effect a satisfactory continuity between the public elementary 
and the four-year intermediate school. There should be, it is felt, a 
more compact organic unity among schools of these different types; 
a division point should be provided so that a pupil at the age of 14 
may discontinue, if he desires, courses reaching completion at that. 
stage. The articulation should be so adjusted that pupils from homes. 
of different social planes may be induced to attend the same school 
through the elementary period. 
The present system of public-school education comprises several 
types of schools related in the following order of continuity and articu- 
lation: 
I. The Folk School: (a) A common-school period for all children 
between 7 and 10. (b) Advanced division of the common school for 
pupils between 11 and 14, the end of the required period. 
II. The intermediate school with a four-year course for pupils 
from 11 to 15. 
III. A modern school division of one year for pupils having com- 
pleted the intermediate school, leading to real-skole (modern school) 
examination. For pupils from 15 to 16. 
IV. A three-year gymnasium for pupils from 15 to 18. 
The law of 1903 was passed with the general purpose of effecting 
a closer union among these types and with the special purpose of 
making the folk school the groundwork of the entire system. As the 
same law provided for additional aid to the intermediate schools, 
one result was the creation of a large number of schools of this kind,
-P-A-G-E-463
  ‘ 
DENMARK. 463. 
supplanting thereby a proportionate number of the private schools, 
which up to this time had prepared pupils for the modern school 
examination. The vogue they gained was not altogether welcomed 
by the teachers and authorities of the Danish folk school. These 
regarded the law as framed and passed mainly in the interest of the 
secondary schools. Political and social conditions rather than ped- 
agogical, it was held,’ had been the causes of the general expansion 
of the intermediate school. But its dual character of a preparatory 
school for the gymnasium and of a modern school had left it with a 
lack of organic unity that has been felt as a defect in its work. More- 
over, the period of 11-15 is not satisfactory, because it fixes a divi- 
sion not at all in accordance with the changes that take place in the 
psychic life of the pupils at these years. The teachers of the folk 
school complain, further, that they lose a number of their best 
pupils who avail themselves of the opportunity to pass into the 
intermediate school at the end of the fourth year, thereby reducing 
the upper classes of the folk school to a form of subordination, both 
in number and prestige. Many of these enter the intermediate 
school without intending to complete its courses, the consequence 
being that they derive but little benefit from its instruction, and, in 
a measure, hamper the progress of others. 
To remedy this defect, a regulation was issued requiring parents: 
and guardians to sign an agreement upon the admission of their 
charges to the intermediate school to have them continue to com- 
pletion. But protests and appeals against this requirement reached 
the supervisory board, with the result that the department in its: 
letter of March 4, 1914, modified the order. While the creation of 
the intermediate school has had undoubted influence for the advance- 
ment of secondary education, its relation to the lower schools, par- 
ticularly with respect to its connection with the latter, has not been 
satisfactory. 
Discussions looking toward desirable changes were begun several 
years ago and are still continuing. In drafting propositions for 
alterations, the schoolmen have had to struggle not only with the 
usual principles of giving the period covered a rational and natural 
beginning, rounded completeness in itself, and adaptation for con- 
tinuance, but also local demands urged by special provinces and, im 
particular, differences between cities and rural communities. In 
consequence, the plans could not be too rigid or inelastic in fixing, 
for instance, the number of weeks in the school year. The economic 
side, too, had to be considered, so that the plan would not entail too. 
great expense by parent or community. Further, any abrupt depar- 
ture from established school traditions would be sure to be opposed.

    464 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Social distinctions, which, especially in Copenhagen, have kept chil- 
dren from different social ranks in separate schools, have been con- 
nected with notions of restriction in the scope and character of the 
work to be done by this or that type of school. 
In order to show the trend of development in the organic relations 
among the schools, several plans for proposed changes (one of them 
submitted in legislative form) will be briefly noticed. 
One of the earliest suggestions came from Prof. Tuxen, the inspector 
of the Danish folk school, and may, therefore, be taken to represent 
views held by this class of educators. He would extend the period 
of compulsory attendance by one year, hence to the fifteenth instead 
of the fourteenth year, making the common-school period cover eight 
years. In this way he would have the three lower classes of the 
intermediate school merged with the folk school. He would take 
up one foreign language in this period and abolish the present final 
examination in the intermediate school. One year should be added 
to the gymnasium, admission to which should require an entrance 
examination. As an alteration of this scope would meet opposition 
in the Rigsdag, he believed a temporary regulation should be made, 
permitting the communities that so desired to put it into effect by 
extending the period of required attendance one year. In his 
opinion, the vital element is to avoid regulating the instruction with 
reference to the gymnasium, but to make it complete in itself, and 
not preparatory. 
In March, 1917, the views held by the representatives of the modern 
(real) school were formulated by A. Christensen-Dalsgaard. He 
refers to a previous expression by the Modern School Association of 
Denmark, in which the members had unanimously agreed to work 
for changes in the common-school law, in accordance with the follow- 
ing general lines: 1. The instruction in the modern school should be 
concluded at the age of 16, with an examination in all branches 
meeting the requirements for entrance to the gymnasium. 2. A con- 
cluding division point in the instruction should be provided at approx- 
imately the fourteenth year. 3. The instruction concluded at the 
fourteenth year should be of an elementary character, with two 
languages and mathematics. 4. The association expressed the belief 
that a school reorganization to this extent could be made without 
materially affecting the modern school or detracting from its inde- 
pendence. 
Outside of the teaching profession it is held—and most teachers 
are in accord with the proposition—that the folk school should be so 
ordered that it can, by continuation classes, impart instruction up to 
the sixteenth year without making it necessary for the pupil to leave 
home. It should be so conducted that the pupil does not become 
estranged from practical work, and unaccustomed to it, and so that
-P-A-G-E-465
  DENMARK. 465 
the expense does not become materially greater than at present. 
Regard should be had to social and economic arrangements, so that 
it does not cause vexatious innovations. The lengthened schoo] 
period must not be extended to a point where schools and instruc- 
tion become uninteresting and fatiguing, very common occurrences in 
the intermediate school. 
Changes in accordance with these views are advocated by school- 
men in western Denmark. A superintendent from this part of the 
country, Karl S. Svanum, outlines a plan based on these principles, 
supporting his plan by details from schools where it has already been 
put into practice. 
How the commission, appointed by the Department of Education 
to draft a revision of the existing law, has understood and embodied 
the present trend can be seen in the draft of a law prepared for the 
consideration of the Rigsdag. In its preliminary remarks the 
commission sums up the objections to the present law and states 
briefly what will be gained by adapting the proposed alterations. 
The law now in effect, the commission maintains, determines the 
articulation from above downwards, with the view of preserving the 
age of 18 as the year when the gymnasium course is to be completed, 
requiring the intermediate school as the preparatory, to conclude at 
15. The immediate difficulty of these time limits is that they leave 
no point of conclusion at 14, the end of the compulsory period, but 
expect that the period would be advanced to 15 years, a change that 
at present does not seem likely. By concluding the intermediate 
school at 14, in accordance with the drafted plan, this difficulty will 
disappear. Another effect will be that the graduates from the 
intermediate school may continue either in the gymnasium or the 
modern school, the period covered by the latter being increased so as 
to comprise two years. The same change will also permit the pupils 
to continue together the first two years, when those who do not wish 
to go through the gymnasium may finish with a suitable examination, 
leaving the last two years for concentration on subjects best suited 
to the maturity of those who continue. 
The drafted proposition thus defines each type of school and fixes 
the years it covers: 
1. Proceeding from the instruction imparted by the folk school 
up to the years 10 or 11, advanced instruction is to be given, first in 
the intermediate school, then in the modern (real) school or the 
gymnasium. 
2. The intermediate school comprises four one-year classes, impart- 
ing instruction of an advanced character and adapted to pupils 
of 10-14, 
171030°—21—Bull, 8930 
 
-P-A-G-E-466
    466 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
8. The modern school continues from the intermediate with two 
one-year classes of advanced instruction leading to a suitable 
examination. 
4. The gymnasium continues from the intermediate school through 
four one-year classes with advanced instruction, adapted as a prepa- 
ration for continued studies. 
The instruction in the gymnasium divides along two chief lines 
according to the studies included in each apd are to be known 
respectively as the linguistic-historical and the mathematic-scientific. 
Besides fixing the course limits and interrelation among the types, 
the law as drawn up has in other paragraphs a number of provisions 
of vital importance in the system. The three-classes of schools— 
intermediate, modern, and gymnasium—may be organized to give 
instruction separatély to boys and girls, or they may be made 
coeducational. Where they are coeducational, certain phases of 
the work may be managed as separate for either sex. 
Touching instruction in religion, pupils who do not belong to the 
State Church may, upon request from parents or guardians, be relieved 
from taking up the subject. 
The commission points out that the proposed arrangement will 
be to the advantage of the common school in that its first three 
years will constitute a distinct unit covering the first stage, at the end 
of which a reclassification of the pupils and a change of teachers takes 
place. As this will leave the four upper classes of the folk school 
running parallel with those of the intermediate, it will be possible to 
group the subjects in such a way that the same plan can be followed 
by both schools. The plan will also lead to a simplification at a 
stage further along. The four-year gymnasium will comprise two 
halves, each a unit in itself. The parallelism of the first unit of two 
years with the modern school of the same period will make the two 
examinations coincide so that the status conferred by the one will 
be equivalent to that of the other. 
As the revised plan reduces the lines of the gymnasium instruction 
by leaving out the classical line, and grouping its subjects under the 
linguistic-historical, the commission points out the advantages it 
believes will result therefrom. The omitted line had been followed 
mainly by students expecting to enter the ministry; but the scope of 
many gymnasia had not been comprehensive enough to include it, 
hence prospective theological students at these institutions had to 
submit to a special examination in the classical languages upon 
entering the university. Under the revised plan it will be possible 
to take up these subjects as a part of the linguistic-historical line 
where occasion demands without any rearrangement of the curriculum, 
Though the plan omits the classical line, it has in reality strengthened
-P-A-G-E-467
  HOLLAND. 467 
the classical studies by giving these an increased number of hours 
in the two concluding years, the years of greatest maturity. 
While the present discussion of the proposed plan has met with 
only such criticism as would be expected upon suggesting a departure 
from a long established order, it has in general been commended for 
the completion of school periods at points coinciding with other 
school requirements and customs, for bringing the subjects of the 
gymnasium into a more consistent grouping and for simplifying the 
articulation among the schools so that they give a more compact 
unity to the system. 
HOLLAND. 
The analogy which the school and school systems of Holland bear 
to those of other European countries is not close enough to preclude 
distinct national traits. These are not so obvious in the distinct 
types of schools and content of courses offered as in the national 
spirit and temperament which pervades and controls them. The 
schoolenactments that were adopted early as guides for subsequent 
development have proved to be a sufficiently safe basis for expansion 
to make unnecessary later enactments of a purely corrective char- 
acter. 
In the statutes regulating the schools of Holland can be traced an 
unwillingness on the part of the legislators to introduce radical inno- 
vations or to impose unnecessary restraints on either parents, teach- 
ers, or local authorities. Hence every movement that has eventually 
resulted in a radical departure from the established order or has 
given rise to a new type of school, such as the up-to-date technical 
and agricultural schools, originated in private initiative, gained local 
support, and expanded through State subventions, marking at every 
stage a steady methodical growth. The lawmakers have assumed 
that the people understood how intimately their interests were bound 
up with the efficiency of the schools and that the people would un- 
grudgingly bear the expense of their maintenance and growth, and 
also that local enterprise and intelligence could be counted on to aid 
in their management. 
The disinclination to regulate where regulation can be dispensed 
with is seen in the attitude of the State toward the earliest training 
of the child. Whatever educational efforts should be made during 
infant years have been thought of as devolving entirely upon the 
parents both as a duty and as a prerogative, hence the State does not 
maintain infant schools nor institutions to provide them with teachers. 
The same objection against unnecessary lawmaking accounts for the 
State’s reluctance and delay in passing a compulsory attendance law. 
Parents saw to it that their children attended the elementary schools
-P-A-G-E-468
    ‘468 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
with regularity. In the attainments of her people in the rudiments 
of education, Holland has ranked favorably with the other European 
countries. In 1900 such a law was, however, passed, but with a 
majority of only one; it fixed the ages 6 to 12 as the period of obliga- 
tory attendance. 
In matters of vital concern to children, particularly the care of the 
youngest pupils, Holland has been by no means slow in passing the 
necessary regulations. The strictest form of inspection has long been 
exercised in supervising the health and care of the young. Official 
reports from every district and school community have been required 
involving a fullness of detail touching the ventilation, heating, kind 
and position of school desks, lighting, cleanliness, the source and 
nature of the water, the playground and instruction in games. The 
regulations also covered the form of the earliest instruction, providing 
that this should not be based on books but should be given in con- 
nection with the handling of objects and with such recreation and 
activity as might be provided in the school garden. 
In determining the amount and character of work a child ought to be 
permitted to do outside of school hours, the controlling authorities 
have evidently avoided attempting to cover it by a legal formula, but 
have left it in such shape that an adjustment may be made by inspec- 
tors on the merits of individual cases. To that end the local inspector 
may [art. 3] grant a temporary exemption from attendance at school for work in agri- ; 
culture, gardening, tending cattle, etc., to children who in the last six months pre- 
ceding the application, have regularly attended school, for not more than six weeks 
annually, not reckoning the vacations. 
This article meets a condition common to all farming districts. At 
certain seasons of the year there is urgent need for the help that pupils 
of school age may be able to render with due regard to their years and 
health. If this demand is sufficiently general in a community, the 
school may, of course, be closed during the busy weeks, but, if this be 
done, there is the danger that some pupils thereby dismissed would 
have to waste their time in idleness. The application for excuse is 
left to an inspector after having heard the reasons, and specified regu- 
larity in attendance may be demanded as a prerequisite for granting it. 
The law of 1900 and the later one of 1911 were found to be sound in 
principle, as proved by the embodiment of their main features in the 
law that superseded them in 1917, a child-protecting law prepared by 
the minister of education. This measure is not a substitution for 
these but rather a development of what was potentially inherent in 
them. The new enactment supplies a number of practical details 
and also extends its general application to urban as well as to rural 
life. In the first place, it distinguishes between wage-earning children 
employed by outsiders and one’s own children employed at individual

-P-A-G-E-469
  HOLLAND. 469 
work, like chores. A child under 12 with the duty of attending school 
may not be employed on the farm; the municipal authorities may, 
however, permit children above 10 to perform certain kinds of work 
under specified conditions. Young persons under 16 are forbidden 
to do any farm work between 9 in the evening and 5 in the morning. 
This clause supersedes the one of 1911 which prohibited factory work 
by children between 13 and 17. 
Holland’s avoidance of measures imposing restraint and her firm 
insistence on essentials have proved to be sound principles in building 
up the system. To the teacher must be left a degree of latitude in 
selecting the studies of the curriculum, in apportioning the number of 
hours, and, most of all, in finding his own methods. The schedules 
made out by an official committee usually bear evidence of a desire © 
to include as many subjects as possible with insufficient regard to 
what may reasonably be managed and assimilated within the time 
allotted, matters concerning which the teacher, who is responsible for 
the results, should have something to say. 
In leaving the way open for individual and local initiative and 
encouraging its exercise in the interest of progress, Holland has not 
altogether escaped the difficulties that obstruct progress of this kind. 
It has not always been easy for her teachers to get out of the old 
grooves nor to take up more timely subjects instead of the old ones 
to which they had been accustomed. The most difficult point in 
choosing details of the study program was settled, fortunately as it 
appears, in 1889, when the law applying to instruction in religion 
was so framed that this subject was not excluded from the schools 
but its presentation regulated so that there could be no objection to 
it on sectarian grounds. Its inclusion was made optional out of 
regard for prevailing views; but if a teacher imparted the instruction 
in such a way as to interfere with the wishes of school patrons, he 
made himself liable to severe penalties. The act which placed the 
private church schools on a par with the State schools by extending 
to them the same amount—30 per cent of the total expense—as 
State subvention, has been regarded as a wise measure for a country 
almost equally divided between Protestants and Catholics. But one 
less fortunate trend has been the result of this enactment. Between 
the private schools and the State schools. arose an unexpected dis- 
tinction through which the latter came to be known as schools for 
the poor. They have, in consequence, suffered a decline so marked 
that in 1917 a request to the Netherland Teachers’ Association 
insisted on an investigation of the support and the attitude of the 
municipalities to the two kinds of schools. 
The teacher of Holland is prepared for his work by a four-year 
course in the training colleges. In one respect the entrance condi- 
tions differ here from those of similar institutions in other parts of
-P-A-G-E-470
470 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
northern Europe, namely, in the requirement of a strict physical 
examination over and above everything else. In other countries, 
to be sure, examiners and school boards are aware of the importance 
of health and vigor, but they usually go no further than to require 
the candidate to be free from such physical defects as may be a 
handicap in the performance of his duties; but in Holland, educators 
hold that it is advantageous for the pupils to have before them in 
their years of plasticity a teacher who is himself developed as a 
strong and even physically attractive personality. Among the 
further prerequisites for a position, the close supervision of the 
practice teaching is worthy of note; during the entire course of this 
part of the teacher’s preparation, he has the benefit of experienced 
help and advice. The number of hours that may be assigned to him 
as pupil teacher are, both for the sake of pupils under his charge and 
for his own sake, limited by carefully considered regulations. 
The teachers are grouped in three categories as a basis for remuner- 
ation and promotion: 
1. Those /holding the position of head master with certificates 
qualifying for this position. 
2. Those holding such certificates but with a position less advanced 
than the one for which they qualify. gis 
3. A final class, namely, assistants. it 
In 1917 the Teachers’ Association advocated the recognition of a 
fourth class, formed from the number of supply teachers appointed 
to fill positions left temporarily vacant. These teachers have been 
necessary, but they have also been a source of perplexity to the 
regularly employed instructors by requiring salaries equal to the 
latter. For this reason the association asks that they form a class 
as reserve teachers with regular salaries. Though the remuneration 
of all classes of teachers has been fair, even generous for normal 
times, the last few years have, here as elsewhere, created conditions 
that compelled teachers to insist on an increase commensurate with 
the advanced cost of living. Through their own organizations as 
well as through their representation in the lawmaking assembly 
they have been able to show the reasonableness of their request; but 
in many districts friction has come about with the farmers who fur- 
nish a part of the increased salary. 
The interruption and dislocation of the school work by the conflict 
near her border have not diverted the attention of the teachers of 
Holland from the permanent issues of their work. Though the 
opportunity of the farm in responding to the call for foodstuffs 
drew a large part of the school population to rural localities for a 
while, there was no evidence that teachers tried to impress pupils 
with the advantage of either rural opportunities or urban oppor- 
tunities. The value of studies leading to productiveness was by no
-P-A-G-E-471
  
HOLLAND. 471 
means underestimated. Yet the people of Holland were unwilling 
to surrender any part of their literary studies in favor of studies 
with greater claims to meeting this one demand of the times. 
Although the schools here have one more foreign language than have 
France, England, and Germany, there was no attempt to relieve the 
schedule by curtailing the time given to Latin and Greek. In the 
case of the Girls’ Higher Burgher Schools, the control of which is left 
entirely with the municipal authorities with no State aid, local 
pressure might have been expected to eliminate the one year of Latin 
or Greek required for admission to the university. In view of the 
flexible schedule of these schools, the alteration could readily have 
been made, yet humanistic instead of productive values so prevailed 
that these subjects were retained. 
Among war measures pertaining to thrift and practical helpfulness, 
the schools of Holland instead of starting many new courses devoted 
themselves to strengthening those that already existed. Clearly the 
choice between the occasional and the permanent was here the 
determining factor. In consequence the courses in domestic service 
and domestic life with all the subjects in hygiene, sanitation, and 
thrift thereto appertaining were strengthened so that they are now 
taught in a more systematic way up to the time the girls reach 16 
with special departments of the same general courses after that age. 
Even in this period of stress the teachers of Holland are taking 
time to improve outside facilities of educational value. This is 
seen in the efforts made to perfect the educational value of the 
Netherland School Museum at Amsterdam instituted by the Nether- 
land Teachers Society.1 This contains an important collection of 
books and periodicals relating to education in Holland and elsewhere, 
and of teaching appliances. Not only are current journals displayed 
on a reading table and past educational journals accessible, but 
an index has been prepared of the articles on education that have 
appeared during the past 40 years in Dutch journals of general 
scope. 
i Holland the war has given an impetus to the study of English 
both independently and in connection with the schools. ‘Their 
neutrality has yielded the Hollanders a number of interned guests 
available as teachers or touchstones of progress.” For the purpose 
of studying the English language and literature English clubs and 
study associations have been established at the university at Utrecht, 
also in Amsterdam and other places. To the same end a Dutch firm 
of publishers is issuing a select series of English literature classics. 
Familiarity with the violence of war has had an unfortunate effect 
on the psychic life of school children not only in the belligerent 
countries but in neutral countries as well. The reports that are at

hand from Germany, Norway, and Holland substantiate the conclu- 
sions that would be expected, namely, that details from the front 
have reached the young with a fascinating appeal, causing a disturb- 
ance in their sense of right and wrong. The abnormal conditions 
existing in certain parts of Holland, especially in the border zone, 
have furnished temptations to laxity and crime. Het Kind, dealing 
with this subject, finds that at Utrecht the number of legal actions 
against young persons under 18 was 176 in 1915, the following year 
year it was 266, and in 1917 it had increased to 324. The damage 
that in this way threatens the moral life of the children has roused 
school authorities in Holland as well as in other countries* to consider 
the most efficient ways of combating it. 
Hardships due to the war touched Holland’s schools and social 
system with full severity. Geographically she held the precarious 
position of lying across the path of traffic between the belligerent 
countries and the world’s food resources. During the course of the 
war she was entirely dependent on imports conditioned on an ex- 
change of exports, generally viewed with suspicion by the opposing 
nations. Within her own borders unscrupulous profiteers did not 
hesitate to sell available food stocks to foreign buyers to an extent 
that threatened depletion and famine. The high cost of everything 
necessitated an internal regulation of prices on a basis partly patri- 
archal and partly socialistic, yet with very little hope of satisfying 
either the trades people or the consumers. The way in which these 
perplexities were met shows characteristic balance and clear view of 
the full effects, so that even when the solution had to be made in an 
emergency its remote consequences were clearly kept in view. 
It is difficult to conceive how the principles that have entered into 
the intellectual and social life of Holland through the medium of the 
schools could have been more severely tested than during the past 
four years and a half. If these principles have guided her to fortu- 
nate solutions of perplexing problems and steadied her in embarrassing 
courses, it is reasonable to see in them evidences of the work accom- 
plished by her schools. 
THE SCHOOLS OF FINLAND. 
With native literary treasures and native culture embodied in her 
traditions, Finland had the prerequisites for an educational system 
with strong national characteristics. From the very first, however, 
educational progress was swayed by influences tending to divert it 
from its native trend. 
1In Germany it is recommended by the Minister of Education, that at stated times a special hour be 
devoted to the discussion of discipline and order and that notions of revenge be abolished from all forms. 
of school life. In Norway the school authorities have under consideration plans to divert the children’s 
attention from scenes of violence to the magnificence of nature. In Sweden six specialists from the Depart- 
ment of Justice have been appointed to prepare a plan for consistently combating the increasing tendency 
toward crime among the young.

  SCHOOLS OF FINLAND. 473 
The foundation on which the present Finnish schools were first built 
was laid between the years 1860-1870, and fashioned according to the 
principles of Pestalozzi. Soon a parallel tendency of an opposite 
character appeared, namely, classical aims, which finally resulted 
in the founding of the gymnasium of the present day. From the 
very first, the two languages used in the schools, Finnish and Swe- 
dish, have each represented a different tendency in shaping the 
school system. Again, every stage in the progress has been marked 
by the political as well as the academic pressure of Russia, Germany, 
and Sweden. 
As in other European countries, the immediate effect of the war 
was to lower the attendance in general and especially in the secondary 
schools and to make it difficult to maintain the schools on account of 
the shortage of teachers. 
In the statistics brought down to the 1st day of February, 1915, 
the schools giving instruction of an elementary character or concerned 
with these are grouped separately, and include the folk school of the 
cities and the country districts, trade schools, household schools, 
continuation schools, training schools for teachers of the primary 
and elementary classes. They number altogether 4,634, of which 
4,470 are the public elementary folk schools. Tho number of teachers 
employed was 6,345, and that of the pupils in attendance 198,038. 
Of the 3,250 schools characterized as higher folk schools 2,806 were 
Finnish, 433 Swedish, and 11 with both languages. The constantly 
growing number of schools has reduced the average distance of these 
from the pupil’s home. During the year 1914-15 the number of 
pupils with less than 3 kilometers between school and home increased 
by 1,481; those living between 3 and 5 kilometers from the school 
increased by 285, while the number of those with more than 5 kilo- 
meters to go decreased by 319. 
In 1915 Evangelical Lutheran congregations to the number of 467 
conducted 454 primary schools. This marked, however, a decrease 
of 199 schools during the preceding five years, one obvious reason 
being the better facilities offered by the public schools. Another 
reason pointed out is that many industrial establishments in the 
communities have taken over arrangements for the first instruction 
of the children, to which the congregations have readily consented. 
The very large number of congregation schools still maintained is 
due to the unusually advanced age (9 years) at which children enter 
the folk school. This made some form of preceding rudimentary 
instruction necessary. It was given at the homes and supervised 
by the clergy through annual inspection at parish meetings in the 
villages. The control was made effective by setting the ability to 
read and write as a condition of preparation for the confirmation 
Tites.

The next stage in the preparation for entrance to the lycees com- 
prises two and often three years in the folk school or an equivalent 
course of instruction in one of the numerous elementary schools. 
The lycees comprise eight classes of which the first five have developed 
‘so as to present finished courses leading to common occupations or 
to business and agricultural schools. This tendency has led to the 
creation of independent schools with five-year courses and equivalent 
in advancement to the communal middle or real schools of Sweden. 
In the statistics the secondary schools (‘learned schools’’) are 
treated with much fullness of details of which the following seem 
most significant: 
In 1916 there were 19 State lycees, 24 private, and 7 communal, 
all using the Finnish language. At the same time there were 7 
State lycees, 10 private, and 4 communal using the Swedish language; 
28 middle schools used Finnish and 8 Swedish; 16 girls’ schools used 
Finnish and 9 Swedish. Of other institutions of advanced rank, 12 
used Finnish and 7 Swedish. Of this total of 150 secondary schools, 
then, 105 used Finnish and 45 Swedish. 
The three upper classes of the lycees constitute the gymnasium 
proper with two groups of courses, the modern group and the classical 
group. In the latter Latin is obligatory, while a choice is left 
between Greek and French. Pupils who do not wish instruction 
in either can elect the modern course in mathematics with the 
addition of physics, chemistry, or drawing. In case they prefer the 
brief course in mathematics as offered in the classical group, they 
can elect this conditioned on taking the modern courses in physics, 
chemistry, and drawing. 
The time and subject schedules now in effect are not at hand, 
but those that were followed before 1905 throw an interesting light 
on the system that then prevailed. In the classical gymnasium the 
apportionment was as follows: The vernacular—the medium of 
instruction which was either Finnish or Swedish—16 hours; Ger- 
man, 12; Latin, 36; French (elective), 6; Russian, 40. In the modern 
gymnasium the Finnish was raised to 18; German to 18, French was 
made required and given 12; English was admitted as an elective 
with 4, and Russian maintained the same as in the classical gym- 
nasium at 40 hours. In 1908 Russian had been reduced to 20 hours. 
The two normal colleges—one at Helsingfors and one at Jy- 
viskyli—are maintained as classical institutions and particularly 
for the training of teachers for secondary schools. The qualifica- 
tions for positions include the preliminary university examination 
for the degree of doctor of philosophy, the completion of two terms 
of a training college with the practice instruction appertaining thereto. 
Further, a specified period of service, participation in criticism and 
conferences, and, finally, a direct teaching test passed upon by a 
 
-P-A-G-E-475
SCHOOLS OF FINLAND. 475 
supervisory committee of the faculty. The candidate is, moreover, 
required to pass an examination in education and didactics before 
the professors in these subjects. 
Three distinct tendencies are very marked: (1) Up to the outbreak 
of the war the Finnish-speaking element, as evidenced by student 
statistics, had made steady headway. Before 1890 Swedish-speaking 
graduates were in the majority, but since this date the Finnish have 
come to predominate. (2) The growth of private institutions with 
consequently greater freedom and variety in teaching plans and 
cultural agencies. (3) Education for present-day practical demands 
as offered in the modern line of the lycee has gained ascendency 
over the classical. This is most clearly seen in the private schools, 
but a similar influence also sways the State schools. 
Finland was far in advance of other countries in providing for the 
higher education of women. The first public secondary school for 
girls was begun in 1788 under the name of Demoisellen-Classe der 
Hauptschule zu Wiborg. In 1804 the name was changed to Téchter- 
schule, and again, in 1842, to Stérre Fruntimmersskolan. In 1835 
a school for young women between 9 and 18 years of age was started 
in Helsingfors; it was conducted in cooperation with a coeducational 
‘primary school for children in the age of 7-10. This institution 
enjoyed a rapid growth, maintaining a faculty of 13 men teachers 
and 2 women teachers besides special instructors in singing and 
calisthenics. This field of educational work become recognized to 
such an extent that in 1844 the State founded an institution for the 
advanced instruction of women. ‘The school law of 1843 fixed the 
status of girls’ secondary schools by coordinating them with the 
school system of the country and specifying the subjects of the 
curricula in those of Wiborg, Abo, Helsingfors, and Fredrikshamn. 
The continual advance of this type of institutions has proceeded by 
increasing the number of classes of those already existing, by granting 
them State subventions and by founding new ones. At the present 
time there are 20 Finnish—or Swedish-speaking secondary schools 
for girls. In their educational work they were able early to over- 
come the prevailing prejudice against gymnastics for women, and 
brought it to such advancement that the instruction in this branch 
as conducted in Helsingfors became a pattern for neighboring coun- 
tries. In other schools coeducation came to be extended from the 
primary classes to advanced secondary instruction until at the 
present day one-half of the total number of schools admit members 
of both sexes to the same educational privileges. In the spring 
semester of 1916 there were 866 women students in the University 
of Finland out of a total attendance of 3,478. 
 
-P-A-G-E-476
  476 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The People’s High Schools conducted in accordance with the 
principles of those in Denmark have gained recognition in Finland. 
They -are founded, owned, and maintained by local organizations, 
but receive no State grant for their support nor aid for students. 
Facilities for higher education are furnished by the Technical 
High School of Helsingfors with four-year courses in the sciences 
theoretical and applied, and by the University of Finland. In 1916 
the university had a faculty of 239 members and an attendance of 
3,478. Many learned societies connected with the university conduct 
comprehensive activities in study and research. 
The latest reports, under date of October, 1918, which have come 
to hand through Swedish sources, speak of far-reaching changes 
and reforms to be inaugurated in the school system of Finland. 
According to these the Senate has appointed experts to submit a 
proposition for the reorganization of the free public school activities 
and, with this in view, to draft a plan for a central board of control 
to be made up of representatives of every active school organization 
and school board. The central board is to perform its duties through 
an executive committee working under its direction. The contem- 
plated activities to be carried out in this manner include the founding 
of libraries, organizing lecture courses, instruction courses, and 
training in the practical arts of the home. The Government, too, as 
it appears, is determined to pass a general compulsory attendance 
law such as had long been discussed. The cost of all changes is. 
estimated at 8,000,000 marks. The expense of maintaining the 
folk schools is to be readjusted so that the communities will receive 
60 per cent of the total from the State. The chief of school super- 
vision has been requested by the Senate to present a detailed proposi- 
tion for the complete reorganization of the school system, based on the 
principle of the folk school as the foundation. The new organization, 
it is expected, will in its fundamental lines be a six-year folk school, 
divided into a first period of two years and a second period of four 
years; a middle school of either three or four years and a three-year: 
lycee, or a total length of 12 or 13 years. Proceeding from the middle 
school as preparatory, instruction would be given in professional 
schools, teachers’ colleges, and lycees. 
REFERENCES. 
The absence of recent statistics has made it necessary to depend largely on current 
educational journals in compiling figures on schools, enrollment, and salaries. Adjust- 
ments in the laws relating to teachers’ salaries, pensions, service bonuses, war bonuses, 
and periodic increments are pending in each of the above-mentioned countries, hence 
it has in some cases been possible to give only the proposed changes, instead of the final 
enactments. What is included in the report has been gathered mainly from the fol- 
lowing sources:

EDUCATION IN ICELAND. 
By Hotmrrinur ARMADOTTIR. 
Iceland (or Island), which is the proper name, is an island lying in 
the northeast Atlantic Ocean touching the Arctic Circle with its 
northernmost points. Its area is about 40,000 square miles; its 
population consists of about 90,000 people direct descendants from 
the Norwegian Vikings mingled with Celtic blood. 
It was discovered at the end of the ninth century, and settled in 
the last half of the ninth and first half of the tenth centuries. The 
settlers had left their country because of the loss of their freedom 
through political struggles. In the year 930 a commonwealth was
-P-A-G-E-478
  478 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918. 
established in Iceland; in 1262 it was united to Norway, and later 
on it became subject to Denmark or, rather, to the United Kingdom 
of Denmark and Norway. Since 1814 Iceland has belonged to 
Denmark alone. On December 1, 1918, Iceland became a sovereign 
State, though in coordinate union with Denmark. The proclama- 
tion of her sovereignty was made on December 2, and celebrated 
with impressive ceremonies. The national flag of Iceland was 
raised at Reykjavik the capital, and saluted by a Danish man-of-war 
sent there for that purpose. 
The language spoken and written in Iceland is almost identical 
with that spoken by the ancestors of the present population, the 
changes being so slight that the Icelandic youth of to-day can easily 
read and understand the first book written in it dating from the 
thirteenth century. 
Shortly after the adoption of the Christian faith, in the year 1000, 
the Icelanders learned the Roman alphabet and substituted it for 
the ancient Runic, which they had hitherto used for engravings on 
stone and metal. Already in the twelfth century schools were 
founded at the two ecclesiastical sees, Volar and Skalholt, and at 
two other places. Young men went to France and Germany and 
other countries to study. When they returned they became bishops, 
ministers, or teachers of the schools. In the thirteenth and four- 
teenth centuries several monasteries were established, and, as in all 
other Christian countries, they became the centers of educational 
development. Some of the schools had the special aim of training 
young men for the ministry; others had the purpose of general 
education of the public. History tells us that they were attended 
by both sexes at all ages, the name of a learned woman who taught 
Latin in one of the schools being given. In this connection the famous 
old Icelandic literature deserves especial mention. The Sagas 
(egendary tales), the Eddas (Scandinavian myths), and other 
classic Icelandic literature were committed to writing in the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries. Early in the sixteenth century the first 
Icelandic books were published, and the whole Bible was printed in 
1583. All through the dark periods of plague, famine, and other 
disasters, the schools were kept open, and they seem to have been a 
vigorous source of life for the stricken people. As a link between 
them and the common people we find, at all times, prominent 
preachers, religious poets, and civil leaders shining out as stars from 
the darkness. For ages it was the duty of the clergy to have super- 
vision of the homes. 
At the age of 14 years, which was the period fixed by law for con- 
firmation, the children were supposed to know the Lutheran Cate- 
chism by heart, and for that they had to learn to read, and many a 
man and woman became a skilled writer. It was the greatest pleas-
-P-A-G-E-479
EDUCATION IN ICELAND. 479 
ure for the people in the rural sections to assemble in the main room 
at the farmhouse during the long, dark, winter evenings, working 
and studying. One read aloud from the Sagas, Eddas, Folklore, or 
whatever books they had at hand. while the rest were working with 
wool, knitting, spinning, carding, carving wood, or doing other kinds. 
of domestic work. The evening ended with religious service, singing 
psalms, and praying. Gradually the towns grew and formal schools 
were established. The young people from the country were then 
sent to schools for the winter season; the working people went to 
towns or trading places to seek work. Home schools of this kind 
are therefore becoming more and more rare. About the year 1880 
an act was passed by the Althing (Parliament) requiring that alk 
children 14 years old should be trained in reading, writing, and 
arithmetic, and also be instructed in the catechism and Bible history. 
To comply with this law, schools and teachers became necessary, 
and, in time, both were provided. According to the law of 1907, 
the country is divided into 220 educational districts. In the five 
towns and in 48 districts, schools have been established, but 167 
provide only itinerant instruction. For each of the school districts. 
a school board of five members is elected, but for the itinerant dis- 
tricts a committee of three members. The cabinet appoints the 
superintendent of elementary education for the whole country. The 
school boards and committees of education have to provide adequate 
means of education and are responsible for the fulfillment of the law. 
All children are bound to go to school six days a week, not less. 
than six months a year, from 10 to 14 years of age in the school 
districts, but in the itinerant districts the children at the best and 
most central farmhouses must get at least a two-months’ course 
each year. For the rest, their instruction depends entirely on the 
homes. If the parents or guardians wish to teach their children 
only at home, they may do so. From 10 to 14 the children are 
expected to go through one grade a year, with examinations. In 
May is held an examination for all children 14 years of age, whether 
they have been at school or not, conducted by a censor appointed 
by the Government or by the country superintendent. If a child 
has been neglected and not sent to school or taught the required 
subjects at home, the parents or guardians are fined. The parents 
or guardians are required to give their children the primary instruc- 
tion in reading, writing, and numbers, either at home or with the 
assistance of a teacher. If they do not, the educational committee 
or the school board is authorized to have the children taught at the 
cost of the parents or guardians. In many of the elementary schools 
are grades for children under 10 years of age, but most of them 
require fees. All schools for children from 10 to 14 years are free. 
For that age a local contribution bears the entire cost of instruction  
-P-A-G-E-480
480 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
with additional support from the county treasury. In several 
places private schools have been established especially for primary 
teaching. 
The subjects the law requires for examination of pupils at 14 years 
of age are: Icelandic (reading, grammar, composition, literature), 
writing, mathematics, religion (catechism, Bible history, psalms), 
geography, natural history, and Icelandic history. Furthermore, ac- 
cording to governmental decree many schools have added singing, 
general history, drawing, physical training, and needlework. A few 
schools give manual training and domestic science; but a great many 
give instruction in one or two foreign languages, preferably Danish 
and English. Most schools begin October 1 and close May 14. For 
that period attendance is compulsory six days a week. At the present 
time no normal person can be found in the whole country without the 
knowledge of reading, and hardly one who is not able to write and 
use numbers. Although there seems to be a great difference between 
the rural popular education and that of the towns and more thickly 
inhabited parts of the country, yet children brought up in the rural 
sections with only two months’ instruction a year, have often proved 
themselves to have better capacities than those from the regular 
schools. In the country the children have to work the greater part 
of the year. Study is a luxury for them, to which they look forward. 
On the contrary, the town children look forward to being free from 
school and prefer to go into the country and help the farmers there 
in summer. The simple and healthy country life gives the children 
living there opportunity to study nature and life in its reality. Very 
often the young people do not go to high schools (unglingaskolar) till 
they are 17, 18, or 20 years old. From the time they leave the ele- 
mentary school till they reach this age they perform manual labor. 
The schools corresponding to the American high schools are 25 in 
number, most of them junior schools. A few of them are evening 
schools and partly technical. Many of them are connected with the 
elementary schools, having the same master and directed by the 
same school board. All these schools are equally for men and women. 
Two senior schools are for women only. In these are grades for 
domestic science, and three schools are for domestic science only. All 
these schools receive more or less aid from the national treasury; a 
few of them are private, but most of them have grants from local 
authorities. Professional schools are as follows: Nautical, 1; me- 
chanical, 1; agricultural, 3; commercial, 1; normal, 1; obstetrical, 1. 
With the exception of the commercial these schools are all national 
and are supported by the Government. For the deaf and dumb there 
is one school. In the town is a ‘‘real’’ school (gagnfriedaskoli), estab- 
lished in 1880.and affiliated with the college in Reykjavik. It is a 
boarding school, as are several of the schools before mentioned. The
-P-A-G-E-481
  EDUCATION IN ICELAND. 481 
College in Reykjavik (the capital of Iceland) is in reality a continua- 
tion of the Latin Skalholt school founded in Skalholt immediately 
after the middle of the eleventh century. It is now in two divisions, 
the ‘‘real’”’ school or high school, and the college. The Icelandic 
name is: Hinn almenni menntaskoli. It is national as is the ‘‘real’’ 
school in Akureysi. 
The University of Iceland was established by the law of July 30, 
1909, and has been active from June 17, 1911. It has four faculties: 
Theology, philosophy, medicine, andlaw. Before its foundation there 
were a school of medicine and a theological seminary in Reykjavik; 
for all other higher teaching the students had togoabroad. A student 
from Iceland had great privileges at the University of Copenhagen. 
Most of them studied there and are still doing so, especially in those 
subjects not offered at the University of Iceland. Besides the Ice- 
landic faculty, there have been French, German, and Danish pro- 
fessors at the university, sent by the governments of these countries, 
but when the war broke out the French and German had to retire. 
Popular lectures were given at the university in philosophy, literature, 
and history; statistics as to the number of attendants on these, how- 
ever, are not available. In the normal school is a course for teachers 
in the spring season, where they not only receive free tuition, but are 
also allowed their traveling expenses and support. Many teachers 
go to the Teachers’ College in Copenhagen for their further education, 
and others now go to America. Men and women have equal right to 
attend all the educational institutions and to fill public offices as well. 
Many of the high schools, likewise those for the professions, are free. 
Schools for advanced education are all free and even give a little 
support to the poorer pupils. 
Since the war began education in Iceland has been at a ‘standstill; 
indeed, retrogression has been seen in some places. In spite of the 
fact that the island is so far away from the great disaster, it has been 
seriously affected. Fuel has been so scarce and the prices of all 
necessaries so exorbitant that both the school year and the daily 
hours have been greatly reduced in most schools, and a few have been 
closed altogether. In common with the rest of the civilized world, 
Iceland earnestly hopes for better times.

PRACTICAL EDUCATION IN CENTRAL AMERICA. 
One of the most interesting aspects of the school situation in 
Central America and Panama is the important position occupied 
by commercial and industrial education in the courses of study of 
many institutions. Public men and teachers in Guatemala, Sal- 
vador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama have taken 
into account the need of offering to the new generation an educa- 
tion which shall be completely practical, with the purpose of turn- 
ing the thoughts and energies of all the youth to fruitful service of 
their country. F 
The teaching of arts and crafts, as well as that of commerce and 
agriculture, was formerly not begun, as in the United States, upon 
the student’s entering the secondary school, though there has for 
some time been a movement to make such instruction a part of the 
work of the advanced classes in the primary schools, to be continued 
in the liceo and the normal schools. 
This universal interest in practical lines of education is a striking 
indication of the influences and tendencies now at work in Central 
America. In the different countries included under this designation 
there are schools and academies, workshops and laboratories, intended 
for the practical education of the student body. When it is remem- 
bered that the introduction of practical and industrial education in 
the school régime of Central America is a matter of the past few 
years, the progress realized is regarded as highly satisfactory. The 
rapid increase of the commerce of Central America, the improvement.

in the means of intercommunication, the travels of 1ts people abroad, 
the influence of foreign elements in its territory, and the various 
interests thus awakened have aroused in the interior of the Republics 
composing it the belief that national greatness in modern times must 
rest upon economic and industrial foundations. The influx of for- 
eign capital and the consequent establishment of powerful industrial 
enterprises have likewise emphasized the necessity of training men 
for work in such enterprises. The introduction of modern ma- 
chinery, the increase of the different forms of the application of 
steam, the adoption of the inventions intended to .gather up the 
results of labor, and numerous similar influences have given rise 
to a tremendous demand in this part of the continent for skilled ana 
reliable mechanics. Central America has thus addressed itself with 
enthusiasm to the task of training the children of its schools for the 
activities of the present day. 
The capitals, other important cities, and even many small towns 
have schools devoted to practical education, generally provided with 
buildings and equipment well adapted to this end. Honduras, for 
example, has founded a school for scientific instruction in the culti- 
vation and preparation of tobacco and for the manufacture of cigars 
and cigarettes in the tobacco district around Danli. In several 
Provinces of the same Republic, and in Panama, where agriculture 
is subordinate, the Governments have founded schools for training 
pupils to weave hats and other objects. 
The more generalized industrial schools are those of arts and crafts 
and the so-called practical schools for boys. Their organization 
presents marked differences. In some of the countries named there 
exist schools that receive pupils either as full or half time boarders, 
and offer night courses as the situation demands. In all these in- 
struction is free. The Government generally offers a certain number 
of scholarships in the boarding schools for pupils approved by the 
different Departments or Provinces of the country. Tools, instru- 
ments, and supplies used in the schools are provided by the Govern- 
ment. In return the school exacts of such students certain services 
and thereby carries out certain work that represents a partial reim- 
bursement for the amount spent upon their maintenance. This is 
the case with the schools of arts and crafts in Honduras and 
Panama. Some small schools of this class are maintained by means 
of the labor they carry on for private individuals and by the sale of 
the products they turn out. * 
These industrial schools are generally of two kinds: (1) Those in 
which the training in commercial subjects and in arts and crafts con- 
stitutes part of the regular course of study and (2) those devoted 
exclusively to the teaching of arts and crafts,
-P-A-G-E-485
  CENTRAL AMERICA. 485 
(1) In those of the first class the pupils study the ordinary subjects 
prescribed by the department of public instruction and devote only 
several hours weekly to arts and crafts. This class in its turn in- 
cludes two groups of institutions. To be admitted to those of the 
first group the pupils must know how to read and write and apply 
the elementary rules of arithmetic. During the entire school year 
instruction is given in Spanish, geography, history, and arithmetic. 
The practical schools for girls and boys are generally of this kind, 
being especially numerous in Guatemala and Honduras. The schools 
conducted by the Christian Brothers in Nicaragua are also of this 
type. The duration of studies is from three to five years, a half day 
being devoted to the classes in the ordinary subjects of primary edu- 
cation and the other half to practical work. In the second group are 
comprised various institutions which require certificates from the 
higher elementary schools, such as the liceo and the higher colegio 
for women in Costa Rica, the National Institute in Salvador, the. 
‘Central National Institute for Boys in Guatemala, and the normal 
schools in these countries and in Honduras. 
(2) Of the special institutions which constitute the second cate- 
gory, there are to be noted two prominent instances in the schools 
of arts and crafts in Panama and in Honduras. In organization and 
purposes they are schools of mechanical arts, and not schools of 
manual training. Their workshops have not been established to im- 
part general notions of manual arts or a general apprenticeship, but 
to train the pupils from entrance upon the line of education chosen 
by themselves. In these schools are taught carpentry, tanning, shoe- 
making, blacksmithing, cabinetmaking, electricity, installation and 
management of machinery, mechanics, printing and bookbinding, 
telegraphy, etc. All workshops in such schools are well equipped 
with machinery and tools. 
All that has been said in regard to modern educational tendencies 
and influences to which boys are subject in the countries mentioned 
can be extended, though in less degree, to the girls and young women. 
Within the past few years women’s sphere of action has steadily 
been enlarged, and has come to include not only teaching but va- 
rious employments in shops and mercantile establishments. Within 
the next few years their instruction must be taken into account in 
schools of domestic training, vocational schools, practical schools, 
and the technical colegios. The organization and range of these 
institutions does not differ materially from those for boys. The voca- 
tional school for girls is essentially a school of arts and crafts in 
which the pupils devote themselves from entrance to the study of a 
special line, such as dressmaking, embroidery, millinery, and, in cer- 
tain schools, cooking, washing and ironing, etc. A certificate of pro- 
ficiency is granted them upon the completion of certain assigned 
 
-P-A-G-E-486
486 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
courses. The other schools for girls before mentioned combine gen- 
eral subjects with the special apprenticeship in crafts upon which 
they enter as soon as they reach the higher classes of the primary 
school and which they continue into the high school and the normal 
school. 
GUATEMALA. 
  The type of industrial education that prevails in Guatemala is 
the combination of general studies with special instruction in the 
arts and trades given in the practical schools for girls and for boys. 
There also exists in the capital a school of arts and crafts for 
women where instruction is given at the same time in the subjects of 
ordinary instruction. In the departments of manual arts which 
are largely, but not exclusively, attended by boys, are taught theo- 
retical and practical blacksmithing, carpentry, printing, bookbind- 
ing and weaving, besides geography, history, botany, chemistry, 
zoology, geology, drawing, and Spanish language and literature. 
In the schools of Guatemala much attention is given subjects of a 
practical nature, with the purpose of training competent workmen 
and artisans. There also exist in this country a National School of 
Commerce, situated in the capital, and a Practical School of Com- 
merce, at Quezaltenango. In both cities there are schools of agri- 
culture which admit to their first-year courses the pupils of the first 
year of the central normal schools. The capital possesses also a 
school of telegraphy, recently founded with the view to installing in 
it a special wireless station. 
SALVADOR. 
Arts and crafts for women, commercial subjects and mechanical 
arts, are generally taught in Salvador in the public schools, though 
their incorporation in the courses of instruction is comparatively 
recent. Many prominent teachers of the country have taken the 
pains to spread abroad the appreciation of the necessity of “ enlarg- 
ing the educational sphere of the State, and opening to the youth 
and to workmen schools where they may acquire practical knowledge 
of the sciences and the arts and by these means may contribute to the 
advancement of general] intelligence in the country.” In compliance 
with these ideas the Government has founded in Salvador a National 
School of Graphic Arts-aiming “to aid the youth of Salvador to the 
acquisition of knowledge of a practical nature, and to put it in a 
position to be successful in the economic struggles which are the 
most important signs of the modern age.” In this school the pre- 
ference is given to the teaching of physics, mechanics, drawing, 
printing, lithographing, carving, bookbinding, and technical teleg- 
raphy and telephoning. Night courses are also given in this school.
-P-A-G-E-487
  CENTRAL AMERICA. 487 
In consequence of the public sentiment above mentioned, there has 
been opened in the National Institute of Salvador a course in com- 
mercial and economic subjects lasting three years. This course 
comprises the study of various modern languages, commercial law, 
political economy, industrial chemistry, commercial geography, book- 
keeping, stenography and typewriting. The pupils in this school are 
required to work several hours daily for a period in the different 
ministerial departments before graduation. Salvador also estab- 
lished in 1918 a school of agriculture, with a department of animal 
husbandry. Two years later there was established the Technical- 
Practical Colegio for Girls, in which instruction in crafts for women 
is combined with that in general subjects. 
HONDURAS, 
Industrial instruction has attained great importance in Honduras. 
The School of Arts and Crafts of Tegucigalpa concerns itself chiefly 
with products in wood and the metals and is steadily training arti- 
sans and mechanics. There likewise exists in this city the national 
automobile school managed by the Government. For some years 
there has been in operation in Siguatepeque a school of English and 
of arts and crafts, in which are taught fiber weaving, carpentry, 
dressmaking, and embroidery. In the normal schools and in the two 
colegios students may choose between the commercial courses and 
those relating to arts and crafts. In 1915 was established a technical 
practical school for girls, where courses in science and in crafts for 
women are offered parallel with the subjects belonging to the primary 
schools. 
GOSTA RICA. 
Costa Rica is another of the Central American countries where 
practical instruction is combined with general. Five institutions 
of higher grade and the vocational schools for women have well- 
equipped workshops, laboratories, kitchens, and laundries. Of all 
Central American States, Costa Rica gives perhaps most attention to 
this special branch of instruction. It is noteworthy that manual arts 
and domestic science are uniformly taught in the secondary schools 
conjointly with the literary and purely scientific subjects. 
NICARAGUA, 
In Nicaragua manual arts form part of the general instruction, as 
has been seen in the case of the normal schools conducted by the 
Christian Brothers. Girls receive practical instruction in the normal 
schools. Some years ago there was established a special school for 
the training of telegraph and telephone operators.

PANAMA, 
Like Guatemala and Honduras, Panama has devoted special atten- 
tion to industrial training. The School of Arts and Crafts of the 
City of Panama is one of the largest and best equipped of its kind. 
It is essentially a school for artisans and possesses sections of elec- 
tricity, carpentry, cabinetmaking, printing and bookbinding, carving, 
foundry work, etc., its principal object being to train men for the 
separate industrial branches. 
Panama also has a vocational school for girls in which a year’s 
instruction is given in telegraphy, one in laundry work, two in dress- 
making and embroidery, two in shorthand, two in cooking, two in 
millinery and flower work. 
It has likewise a school of agriculture, in which is given a three 
years’ course, for which the Government offers 30 scholarships to 
youths approved by local ‘authorities. The Government has also 
founded from time to time specialized schools in the interior, with 
the object of encouraging agriculture or some other industry, such 
as that of the manufacture of Panama hats. Like Honduras, Panama 
devotes the greatest attention to special industrial schools. 
For the furtherance of commercial education in Central and South 
America a Pan American College of Commerce, to be located at the 
City of Panama, is projected, under the joint auspices of the Southern 
Commercial Congress of the United States and the Government of 
the Republic of Panama. The active support of the countries of the 
two Americas is to be sought, and it is hoped that it may be opened 
on January 1, 1921, the quadricentennial year of the City of Panama, 
the first city to be founded by Europeans in the Western Hemisphere. 
The college is designed to train the youth of the two continents in 
practical courses of commerce, shipping, banking, and international 
trade relations generally. 
NEW SCHOOL REGULATIONS IN BRITISH GUIANA. 
The last report of the director of primary instruction in British 
Guiana outlines a new regulation for the common schools. In many 
of its parts it includes novel measures of school organization which 
are of interest as suggestions to other South American States for 
similar action. The regulations relate to the classification of schools, 
the minimum period of attendance, the age limit of pupils, the occu- 
pations of pupils after leaving school, school gardens, ete. As an 
instance of its stringent character, the regulation decrees that when 
any school ceases to conform to certain conditions with regard to 
building, installation, equipment, and health conditions, it shall be 
classified in B category; and if within 6 months it has not satisfied
-P-A-G-E-489
  ARGENTINA. 489 
the requirements of the regulation, the authorities shall suspend the 
Government aid hitherto granted. It is to be noted that the primary 
schools of British Guiana are not directly administered by the au- 
thorities. 
The school also loses its governmental aid if within two consecutive 
years it does not maintain a fixed minimum attendance, which varies 
according to the population of the locality in which it is situated. 
In return special aids are offered for schools that teach gardening 
for boys and the care of smaller children for girls from 12 to 14 
years. c 
The greatest educational need of the colony is the establishment 
of technical primary schools for the instruction of boys and girls 
from 11 to 15 years. It is projected to establish two such schools 
in Georgetown in which there shall be taught, in addition to manual 
arts and other craft, drawing in all its branches, arithmetic and 
geography as related to commerce, the rudiments of experimental 
science, shorthand, and business correspondence. Criticism has been 
directed against the omission of instruction in agriculture, which is 
admitted to be the most necessary branch in the colony. It is, how- 
ever, intended to impart agricultural instruction in special schools 
to be established. 
Because of the fact that the majority of the pupils leave school 
before reaching 12 years, it is not possible to put into practice sug- 
gested plans of giving them preoccupational instruction in which 
they might be making a start before the end of their primary-school 
studies. On the other hand the traditional primary school is not 
adequate to give direction toward a vocational subject. Hence, to 
the regret of the authorities, attempts to link the primary school with 
the occupation of the pupil have been abandoned. 
Much interest has been developed in school gardening; and about 
100 gardens are annexed to primary schools, affording practical in- 
struction to pupils in agriculture and horticulture. The Govern- 
ment has also established 8 model gardens, where instruction is 
given the pupils of neighboring schools. 
ARGENTINA. 
PRELIMINARY. 
Two well-defined stages have marked the progress of national 
education in Argentina since 1916. The first began with the re- 
organization of primary instruction by act of the Federal Congress 
early in that year, which came about largely through the initiative 
and efforts of the minister of public instruction. It had long been 
felt that the legal system in force since 1882 was unsatisfactory,
-P-A-G-E-490
  490 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
especially on the point of articulation of secondary education with. 
the higher elementary on the one hand and with the universities on 
the other. Argentine educational thinkers asserted that secondary 
education prepared neither for practical life nor for entrance to the 
technical schools and the universities, inasmuch as it had remained 
unchanged for more than a generation, in the face of the social, 
economic, scientific, and ethnical changes through which the country 
had passed. 
Together with this dissatisfaction with a special division went the 
conviction that governmental reform should strike deeper, and in- 
stead of busying itself with plans of reform of courses and schedules, 
should settle the fundamental question of what should be the nature 
and aims of the national secondary school. This could be done only 
by so modifying the prevailing system as to make it fit the needs 
of the school population according to their age, social conditions, 
and probable future. Proof that it had not so adapted itself was 
thought to be found in the fact that of the pupils annually com- 
pleting the 4a elementary grade only 45 per cent continued into the 
colegios nacionales, as contrasted with 55 per cent who went into 
the 5a grade and commercial schools, while on a moderate estimate 
60 per cent left with insufficient equipment for their needs as useful 
members of society. Furthermore, the secondary school, as organ- 
ized, offered no opportunity to boys and girls of 13 and 14 years 
to choose the advanced courses and vocational training for which 
they felt an aptitude, and so to secure adequate preparation for the 
university studies or for advanced technical, industrial, and com- 
mercial schools. 
For this lack of correlation between educational divisions it was 
proposed to substitute a logical and unbroken sequence. What came 
to be commonly accepted among education authorities as best serv- 
ing this purpose was a common intermediate school of three years 
of an essentially practical character, carrying on general elementary 
instruction by means of book lessons and developing by special ex- 
periments and practical methods individual aptitudes by which to 
determine future training. As the basis for such a school primary 
education had, of course, to be modified, and after months of dis- 
cussion a scheme for general modification of the entire educational 
fabric was outlined (1916). According to this, the primary school 
proper was to cover four years; the uniform middle school of the 
first grade one year; and the differentiated middle school of the 
second grade two years. Upon these were to be based the colegios 
nacionales, the normal schools, the industrial schools, the various 
higher special schools, and the national universities. Though mark- 
ing a meritorious attempt to articulate the several divisions, the
-P-A-G-E-491
  ARGENTINA. 491 
project did not work out satisfactorily in actual operation, and as 
a constituent part of the national system it was repealed after about. 
a year of operation. 
ILLITERACY. 
On a basis of population estimated (1917) at slightly more than 
eight millions, 725,000 were estimated to be illiterate, about 42 per 
cent of the school population. Illiteracy is most rife in remote Prov- 
inces of the Andes and in the Territories, sparsely settled and inhab- 
ited by people of roving habits and poorly developed industrially. 
Under the lead of the director general of the schools of the Province 
of Mendoza, a systematic campaign to eliminate illiteracy was begun 
in 1916. It was recognized that financial considerations made it im- 
possible to establish the number of primary schools which would be 
demanded, certainly not for the many remote points where only the 
legal minimum of 15 or 20 illiterates were to be found. Home 
schools (escuelas del hogar) were therefore established, officially 
ranking as auxiliary to the already existent schools, for illiterates of 
& to 20 years, and offering as a minimum curriculum reading, writ- 
ing, the four fundamental operations of arithmetic, the duties of the 
Argentine citizen, elements of ethics, and personal hygiene. Such 
schools may begin any day of the year, and with a minimum of five 
pupils. Any person desiring to open such a school must fulfill the 
following conditions: 
(a) He must be at least 20 years of age, of good moral reputation, 
certified by the chief civil official of his residence. 
(6) He must speak the national language correctly and be able to 
give instruction in it. 
Such schools shall not be established at less distance than 5 kilo- 
meters from an established primary school supported by national, 
provincial, or local funds, but if the school be intended exclusively 
for boys from 15 to 20 years old it may be located at any point. Such 
schools are to be visited freely by school and civil authorities, and by 
persons designated by the provincial general inspectors. 
Related in character to the escuelas del hogar of the Province are 
the escuelas tutoriales, established by national decree of 1916, apply- 
ing to all the Provinces and especially to the Territories. In these 
schools, established at points designated by the National Council of 
Education, any number of children not regularly enrolled in the pri- 
mary schools may be taught by private individuals who conform to 
the requirements of primary teachers, and by teachers regularly en- 
gaged in primary work. The latter, by special exception, receive 
additional compensation for such instruction. The same law also 
 
-P-A-G-E-492
  492 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
provides remuneration, to be fixed by the general council of education 
of the Province or Territory for all persons, not teachers, who are 
certificated to have taught illiterates, whether children or adults, to 
read and write. 
Most novel of all undertakings for the wiping out of illiteracy are 
the traveling schools (escuelas ambulantes). Provided for by the 
original organic school law of 1884, these schools were not, because 
of lack of funds, put into operation until 1914. Up to that time 
there was a conviction that their need was insignificant by contrast 
with the greater problem of illiteracy in the cities, and that to scatter 
funds available for combating illiteracy was not prudent. How 
serious this mistake was appeared in 1914 when it was ascertained 
by systematic count that of nearly 35,000 children of the Territories 
not in school only 6,000 lived in towns. 
Located first in Province of Catamarca, and in the mountain 
regions of Rio Negro and the Chubut, these schools are built of 
materials easily transportable, and accommodate an average, of 25 
pupils. Sites are selected for them which are most accessible to the 
largest number of children in the district. Teachers traverse such 
regions on foot or muleback, carrying necessary equipment for in- 
struction, and remain four and one-half months at each place, giving 
instruction in reading, writing, elements of arithmetic, and hygiene. 
A decided advantage is found in this succinct curriculum, the average 
of successful study by the pupils of these schools being, it is claimed, 
fully on a par with that of the pupils of the nine months’ primary 
schools, who are required to take the standard number of subjects. 
Within their first two years of existence, 20 of these schools were 
established, as reported by the National Council of Education in 
December, 1916; and 12 were added in 1917. The report of the 
inspector general of the Province of Mendoza concluded as follows: 
This new type of school must exist for many years in Argentina to answer 
the needs of the actual distribution 9f the population, the lack of adequate 
means of communication, and the impossibility of maintaining fixed schools 
in the greater part of the zones engaged in agriculture and cattle raising. It 
behooves the authorities, therefore, to continue the improvement of the system 
in such manner that its efficiency shall be steadily ERAN and that results 
shall amply compensate for their maintenance. 
An interesting phase of social conscience is shown in the generous 
offer of the women pupils of the third and fourth years of the normal 
school at Santa Fe to instruct illiterates afternoons and nights in 
reading, writing, the elements of arithmetic, national language and 
history, and practical personal and school hygiene. This offer has 
been highly commended both by Argentine and foreign educators 
as a step toward solving the problem of illiteracy, worthy of imita- 
tion nationally and locally.
-P-A-G-E-493
  ARGENTINA. 493 
- The struggle against illiteracy has been the subject of serious con- 
sideration by the executive, the chief school authorities, and the Con- 
gress. The executive has constantly urged the National Council of 
Education to intensify its campaigns and has cooperated by all means 
in his power in the steady diffusion of education. The Houses of 
Congress have also busied themselves especially with this grave 
problem. Tlese efforts have borne fruit which, if not visible at the 
present time, is certainly destined to raise the level of popular educa- 
tion within the next few years. The authorities have judged that 
what is needed is the patient labor which does not require an imme- 
diate and striking solution of a most difficult problem, but is willing 
to continue to exercise an ever-increasing influence upon the rising 
generation, confident of the spread of education and enlightenment 
with the increase of population and the improvement in means of 
communication; and that it is not wise to sow schools broadcast 
throughout the Republic merely for the pleasure of doing something 
and of doing it rapidly. The success of the struggle against 
illiteracy, certain as it is, has its roots not in merely spending much 
money, but in spending money well. 
REPORT OF NATIONAL COUNCIL OF EDUCATION, 
The progress of education in Argentina is best epitomized in the 
report of the National Council of Education for the four years end- 
ing December 31, 1916, The character of this council is unique in 
educational polity, wielding, as it does, greater powers than any 
similar body in countries educationaly advanced, and counting in 
its membership some of the ablest men in the Nation. Its reports 
follow traditionally the line of national (the capital city), pro- 
vincial, and territorial administration. When the very hetero- 
geneous character of the population of Argentina, due to the steady 
stream of immigration, is taken into account, the necessity of such 
a central body, vested with powers of initiation and execution in 
primary education, is apparent. By a wise division of powers in the 
original organic law, the control of secondary education was left in 
the hands of the Provinces, with subsidies granted by the National 
Government, as-was the right to prescribe subjects essential to na- 
tionalistic and patriotic training. Concentration of effort and power 
is thus secured, with national acquiescence in the official actions of the 
council. Its activities center naturally around the establishment of 
new schools and the construction of school buildings, and the train- 
ing of teachers to meet the demands of modern conditions, 
As a substitute for the abortive intermediate schools established 
in 1916, which soon proved unsatisfactory, the council decided later 
in that year to establish, parallel and auxiliary to the higher pri- 
 
-P-A-G-E-494
  494 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
mary schools, one of practical arts and crafts for each sex in every 
district of Buenos Aires. Such schools approximated 100 in num- 
ber. This type of school was designed for boys and girls not intend- 
ing to proceed to higher studies, and was later to be extended to 
the nation at large. Its purpose and program of studies was two- 
fold—to complete the theoretical and higher courses of the higher 
primary schools with vocational, technical, and manual training, 
based upon and making use of the materials which were peculiarly 
Argentine and local in industries, commerce, art, and economics; 
and to lay stress throughout on nationalistic and patriotic aims. 
An interesting feature, common to these new schools and the con- 
tinuation schools now arising in England and France, is the pro- 
vision by which they operate 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours 
in the afternoon or night, and are to admit pupils from the fourth 
to the sixth grade of the primary schools, who have reached the 
age of 12 years. Statistics as to the success of these schools are 
not as yet available. ; 
In the matter of building primary schools proper, the report of 
the council shows progress throughout the four years covered. A 
total of 62 schools, with 426 teachers and 19,563 pupils, was added 
to the system. Because of national economic and financial condi- 
tions prevailing half a century ago, the great majority of the pri- 
mary schools began operation in private buildings, which did not 
conform to pedagogical or even sanitary requirements. For many 
years excessive rents were often paid by the State, but upon the 
revaluation of property in many Provinces in 1915, an economy in 
rents was effected, and the funds thus saved were devoted to new 
schools. Despite high prices of material and difficulties of labor, 
in December, 1916, eleven school buildings were in process of erec- 
tion, at an estimated cost of $750,000, with a capacity of 22,000 pu- 
pils. According to the report of the council: “The construction of 
properly equipped Government primary school buildings has con- 
stituted one of the most serious problems and, therefore, one of the 
chief occupations of the council.” It was frankly admitted, how- 
ever, that, with all the efforts of the council, accommodations for 
children in the primary schools were still far from adequate, it be- 
ing estimated on that date that 4,000 additional schools of this 
grade were needed for the more than 600,000 children in the capital 
and the Territories who, for one reason or another, were not in school. 
The activity of the council continued to be marked in 1917. In 
April of that year, 143 new schools were decreed, 39 for the Federal 
Capital, 18 for the Provinces under the legal national subvention, 
and 86 for the Territories (30 being escuelas ambulantes), the Con- 
gress voting two millions in the national budget for the execution of 
this decree. The centralizing tendencies of South American coun-
-P-A-G-E-495
  ARGENTINA. 495 
tries in general, and the overwhelming dominance of the capital, 
secured for it so generous a share of this that it is estimated that 
in the Federal capital there will be for the first time room for all 
children of school age. For the poorer Provinces, and the Terri- 
tories, which by the Tainez law of 1886 are absolutely dependent 
upon the central authority of the National Council, 250 schools of 
one and two rooms were assigned, but on an estimate about one-third 
of the children were still left unprovided with school facilities. 
Attention was repeatedly called to the need of a uniform and rig- 
orously applied national law for compulsory school attendance. 
During the year 1918 approximately 400 schools were established, 
and the council proposes to establish as many more during 1919 in 
the Provinces and the national Territories. The nation has taken 
charge of many provincial schools which the respective governments 
could not maintain by reason of lack of resources. The Province of 
Mendoza alone transferred 130 schools to the council of education 
during the month of August, 1918. Relative to the establishment of 
schools, regard has been had chiefly to the population of the districts 
which petitioned for them, as well as the number of children of 
school age, in order that the buildings may be installed in populous 
centers, where a constant attendance of pupils is reasonably assured. 
The general plan of the council for the diffusion of primary educa- 
tion has not been put into practice in full, because of the lack of 
resources in some instances and in others because of the scarcity of 
building materials in the country. School equipment has been 
secured in various countries, supplies necessary having been pur- 
chased in the United States to the value of $350,000. The demand 
has been still unsatisfied, the capital city alone calling for the estab- 
lishment of new schools every year, because of the increase of children 
of sthool age, and the Provinces have always been behind the neces- 
sary number of school buildings and facilities and have never reached 
the goal set by the authorities. An encouraging feature of the situa- 
tion is that upon the completion of all the school buildings now under 
construction accommodations for 56,000 pupils in addition will be 
provided. 
Peculiar attention has been given to the development of night 
schools by the council, 86 having been established and maintained by 
the council in the four years covered by the report. An admirably 
broadened scope was given them in the appeal issued by the council 
to the nation that the full purpose of such schools should be realized 
not only by the attendance of illiterates, but also of youths and 
adults “who, possessing some degree of education, are also desirous 
of improving that as related to the needs of their lives.” All reforms 
and modifications of night schools have concerned themselves with 
this larger clientele. A further socializing of the night school is seen
-P-A-G-E-496
    496 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
in the appeal of the council to proprietors, managers of factories, and 
employers of labor generally to encourage in every way in their 
power their employees to attend. night schools and to offer prizes of 
various kinds for diligence and progress. Literature bearing on these 
schools was distributed free by the council. 
In 1915 the council was empowered, by the terms of the will of a 
philanthropic resident of Buenos Aires, Don Felix Berasconi, who 
bequeathed for educational purposes a sum of three and a half mil- 
lion dollars, to proceed to the erection and establishment of an insti- 
tution under State control which should give instruction in general 
primary, scientific, scientific-industrial, physical, and social educa- 
tion. A building was to be begun in 1916, planned in seven sections, 
conforming to the most modern pedagogical and sanitary demands, 
and with a capacity of more than 3,000 pupils. Designed to benefit 
the working people preeminently, it was to be situated in the section 
of the city showing the greatest proportion of them. 
Responding to the general feeling of dissatisfaction with the re- 
sults of primary education in the city of Buenos Aires, which has 
been unaffected by criticism for seven years, the council in June, 1917. 
sent out questionnaires to all inspectors and to the body of teachers 
calling for an expression of opinion as to (1) the merits and defects 
of the plans of studies, schedules, etc., then in force; (2) those of 
_ projected or possible programs, with additional features worthy to be 
incorporated; and (8) educational considerations bearing upon the 
problems of the schools of the capital. The answers showed encour- 
aging grasp of the educational needs of the city, with significant 
unanimity as to the practical methods of working out necessary 
reforms. Salient points were: 
1. That all programs should leave room for and be closely articu- 
lated with manual arts and domestic economy. 
2, That the courses of arithmetic in the first, second, third, fourth, 
and fifth grades were overloaded, as were those of grammar in the 
fourth, geometry in the third and fifth, nature study in the second, 
geography in the second and fifth, singing in the second, and music. 
3. That the primary school cycle should commence at 7 years and 
end at 12. 
4, That primary courses and schedules for urban schools should 
be strictly differentiated from those for rural and country town 
schools. \ 
5. That from October 15 to April 15 the school day should be 
from 7.30 to 11.30; from April 15 to September 30 from 12 to 4. 
6. That the advancement of the teacher with the class merited a 
fair trial, the teacher remaining with the same class a minimum of 
two years and a maximum of three.
-P-A-G-E-497

%. That the establishment of normal schools essentially for rural 
teachers was imperative. 
It is recognized that the clearness and sanity of these answers had 
a marked effect upon the substance of the law presented to the Fed- 
eral Congress in August, 1918. 
Another interesting instance of the submission of a pedagogic 
matter to the teachers of the city of Buenos Aires is shown in the 
questionnaire asking their opinion as to the best method of teaching 
spelling, sent out by the inspector of the tenth district, to the 
teachers. In accordance with the answers to this, the vocabulary 
used in primary schools was reduced to categories corresponding to 
the several grades, to its difficulties, and to the actual needs of the 
life and dominant occupations of the quarter of the city from which 
the children were drawn. This step was highly commended in 
French educational circles as marking efficient grappling with 
pedagogical difficulties felt in all cities of whatsoever country. 
The regulation of the medical and dental inspection of national 
schools, under decree of March, 1918, was noteworthy. According 
to this, professional inspectors, chosen by the Government, must 
within the first three months of each school year examine indi- 
vidually all children entering school for the first time, periodically 
inspect the school buildings and ground and the health conditions of 
the teaching and administrative staffs, and take all prophylactic 
measures deemed necessary against epidemics and contagious dis- 
eases. Such reports shall be transmitted to the medical inspector 
general. Dental inspection of schools is to have a prominent part. 
Every month the chief inspector shall assemble for report and mutual 
discussion all medical and dental inspectors in such territorial divi- 
sions as he shall see fit. 
Of the regulations in detail promulgated by the council in 1918, 
the most important is that changing the school year to two divisions, 
the first beginning March 1 and continuing until June 30, followed 
by three weeks of vacation, and the second beginning July 21 and 
continuing until November 20, followed by the long vacation of the 
year. This change is regarded as conforming with climatic effects 
upon the health of school children and as being a step long needed. 
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN THE PROVINCES. 
Outside the scope of the National Council are the powers of the 
provincial councils. These are local, auxiliary, and reinforcing in 
character. Some of the Provinces are practically inactive on the 
side of primary education, contenting themselves with the provi- 
sions made in that field by the National Government... Others, how- 
ever, among them Santa Fe, San Luis, Cordoba, Entre Rios, and,

e 
of course, Buenos Aires, are worthy of note and commendation for 
. steady interest in matters educational, and in financial support of 
schools carried on independently of the central authority. 
Progress in the Province of Santa Fe, as evidenced by the annual 
message of the governor of that Province for 1917, was steady, 
despite the need of economy in provincial finances due to conditions 
resulting from the World War. An increase of 14 provincial schools 
over the year previous and of the grades in 36 schools was noted. 
Two problems were kept steadily in view: The improvement in the 
teaching personnel, accentuated by the disclosure of the fact. that 
more than one-third of the teachers in the provincial schools lacked 
teacher training, and the construction of better school buildings. It 
was estimated that with these from 25 to 80 per cent of additional 
pupils could be taught by the same teaching force. 
In the Province of San Luis the general inspector of provinces 
reported for 1916 the establishment of 160 local associations of the 
national Amigos de la Educacion. This society, composed of parents 
and others interested in primary education, has for its objects the 
close linking of home and school, the fight against illiteracy, the 
promotion of good feeling and companionship between natives and 
immigrants, the celebration of national festivals, the securing of 
better primary enrollment and attendance especially by the poorer 
children, with the inculcation of their self-respect, and cooperation 
with the regional and national authorities in the safeguarding of 
public health. 
In this Province, by volunteer organizations of teachers and others 
interested, local patriotic conferences were inaugurated on topics of 
national history, hygiene, political economy, ethics, and themes gen- 
erally related to home and school matters. 
In the Province of Buenos Aires school excursions have been de- 
veloped and made an organic part of instruction in civic and national 
spirit. They have been so arranged that children in the several zones 
may come by personal touch to know and correspond by letter with 
each other. In some places participation in these excursions has 
been made a reward of good lessons and conduct. They are to be 
taken in the last 15 days of October, and children are not to remain 
more than 3 days in one locality. Groups of not more than 12 pupils 
are recommended. 
In July, 1916, the council general of the Province of Buenos Aires 
initiated courses in the normal school for the training of teachers 
and graduates of the normal schools in the recognition and study of 
retardation and its causes, and in early correction of abnormalities 
most frequently met. The program of courses includes a series of 16 
lessons on related medical and pedagogical topics.
-P-A-G-E-499
  ARGENTINA, 499 
Of direct bearing upon educational problems among the rural 
population is the project. of the law recently sent by the executive 
of the Province of Buenos Aires to the legislature, providing for the 
issuance of bonds to the amount of $45,000,000 for the expropriation 
of parts of the great landed estates and the division of the land thus 
expropriated into small tracts for the use of small farmers. Subse- 
quent purchase under advantageous terms is to be encouraged. Ac- 
cording to reports, the prevailing system of “arrendatorios,” or 
small tenants for short terms, has led to so acute an agrarian unrest, 
with the consequent shifting and aimless wandering of an increasing 
element of the population, as to constitute a social and economic men- 
ace no longer to be ignored. The educational effects in the increase 
of illiteracy and the general retardation of primary education have 
been manifest. 
In 1918 the Legislature of the Province of Entre Rios enacted into 
law a series of provisions guaranteeing the stability of the scale of 
salaries for teachers in provincial schools. Promotion and increase 
of salary were based rigorously upon merit; teachers were declared 
unremovable during good conduct and fitness; initial salaries were 
fixed as follows: (a) For normal teacher, $160 per month; (0) for 
rural normal teacher, $120 per month; (c) for rural teacher, $100 
per month; (d) for special teacher, $80 per month. Every five years 
the teacher who has worked in the same place for that period shall 
receive a bonus of 20 per cent on his initial salary. 
’ The government of the Province of Cordoba has approved a plan 
for the introduction of agricultural courses in the primary schools, 
presented and prepared by experts in agronomy and pedagogy, with- 
out dislocation of existing courses and schedules. 
The inspectors of this Province presented for the consideration of 
the provincial chamber of deputies the project of a law to establish 
a normal school for the preparation of rural teachers exclusively, the 
courses offered being: 
(a) The development of subjects related to fundamental studies 
in the primary schools; 
(6) Practice teaching adapted to the needs of the primary schools 
of the locality; and 
(e) Elementary teaching, both theoretical and practical, in manual 
arts, agriculture and cattle breeding, and minor rural industries. 
Private schools conforming to governmental requirements were 
legally recognized and incorporated by decree of 1917 and their con- 
sequent validation effected. Pupils of the fifth and sixth grades of 
such private schools applying for leaving certificates are required 
to undergo an examination upon all subjects for those grades of the 
official national programs before a board of three members appointed 
by the inspector.
-P-A-G-E-500
   500 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Officially apart from the Ministry of Public Education but call- 
ing for special mention was the establishment in 1917 under the 
encouragement of the National Department of Agriculture of 16 
schools in rural domestic science in nine Provinces, including Buenos 
Aires. Courses are offered in minor industries, such as dairying, 
beekeeping, care of fowls, hog raising, agriculture, horticulture, and 
canning of fruits and vegetables. Five hundred women have been 
enrolled. A number of these schools, the largest at Tucuman, have 
been put on a permanent basis, and private associations are working 
to effect this in many places. 
School celebrations of national festivals, long popular in Argen- 
tina, have been especially marked during the year 1918, the cen- 
tennial year for the nation. They were held in all schools on 
July 8, the chief feature being the oath to the flag and the singing of 
the national hymn in the presence of the school and civic authorities. 
CHANGES UNDER THE PROJECTED LAW OF 1918. 
Following the former order of education in Argentina, the second 
stage of primary education began with the educational bill sub- 
mitted with the approval of the President to the Federal Congress 
in August, 1918. In this were incorporated changes of far wider 
scope than any ever before projected. Not only primary education, 
but the entire fabric of Argentine education was to be nationalized 
in content of courses, in methods of instruction, and in special prepa- 
ration of teachers for tasks devolving on them under the new régime. 
The bill provided for large development of industrial and vocational 
courses and called for the use of materials peculiarly national and 
local. It laid stress upon civic and patriotic training, in view of the 
heterogeneous constitution of the Argentine population through 
steady streams of immigration and the necessity of molding these 
diverse elements into a body of patriotic and intelligent citizens. It 
provided for the establishment of primary schools throughout the 
nation under more flexible financial and administrative regulations 
than the old, for the segregation of specific revenues for the exclu- 
sive use of the Ministry of Public Instruction, and the consequent 
abolition of the old system of national subsidies to individual local- 
ities. Especially in the fight against illiteracy did the projected law 
embody progressive features. The National Council of Education 
was empowered to establish standard primary schools wherever there 
were as many as 20 illiterate children of school age. In the message 
which accompanied the recommendation of the law the President 
pointed out that the projected law tended to give unity and stability 
to the several divisions of education under the direction of the de- 
partment of national instruction and adapted them to the material
-P-A-G-E-501
  ARGENTINA, 501 
progress of the nation and to latter-day civilization. His identifica- 
tion of popular education with national progress justifies a quotation 
at length: 
As primary education was established by law in 1864, it contains regulations 
which in reality have lost their original justfication; for Argentine civilization 
now demands urgent reforms in the the matter of general instruction in order 
to give greater consistency and reason to the latter, and in order to make it 
more practical, more adaptable to the various regional needs of the Republic. 
It is especially urgent to carry its action to all the sections of the country not 
yet reached by the-system in order to arrive at the real aims of a truly na- 
tional education. Chief among these is to eradicate illiteracy, the most patriotic 
task in which we can engage and the one upon whose successful execution alone 
can any real national progress and enlightenment rest. 
The institutions of higher education have continued to develop in the direc- 
tion of autonomy and within the limit determined by the law of 1885; but with 
the primary, they demand modifications in the course and arrangement of 
studies in order to abolish antiquated practices and methods and to reach the 
level of the great modern universities of the world. 
Secondary instruction, in its turn, has lacked and still lacks a law to fix it in 
definite form and to define its real character in accordance with constitutional 
precepts and the nature of our political institutions. It has existed subject 
to the continual change of plans and regulations, harassed by the application of 
widely varying educational conceptions, in a state of continuous instability, and 
therefore reduced to a mere administrative mechanism without power of 
initiative relative to its immediate needs and without sufficient social influence 
to realize its true aims. To remedy these evils and to fill these gaps is one of 
the purposes of this law, in which the attempt has been made to include only 
that which ought to be general and permanent. The primary aim of secondary 
education should be to spread education among the towns and cities in such a 
way that in all the country there shall be trained, educated citizens fitted to 
play their part in the future civilization of the country. Preparatory instruc- 
tion has therefore been kept under the control of the universities, which will 
fix their courses of study, their duration, and their extension both general and 
special. Both the plans of the preparatory courses, as well as those of the 
professions taught in the faculties of the university, have been projected along 
the lines already mentioned. The programs of the normal schools have been 
formulated in accordance with the technical ideas which should distinguish 
them, separating the general studies from those properly called pedagogical or 
professional, arranging them so that the former shall precede and the latter be 
intensified toward the end of the course. 
As regards practical subjects of instruction, the project outlines only the 
general features according to which they must be taught. Instruction will be 
imparted in accordance with the necessities of the immediate field of each 
school, with special regard to natural production, commerce, industries, and 
aptitudes of the population, all with the purpose of adjusting anew the activi- 
ties of the Argentine youth, which has hitherto been by preference inclined 
toward the more speculative studies rather than those of practical and of imme- 
diate application. It is left to the authorities of technical education to prepare 
plans and courses of study adapted to each class of institutions. 
Enrollment in all schools has been made absolutely free, a logical consequence 
of compulsory education, which has as yet never been effective, but which is 
an indispensible condition to placing all upon the same plane of equality, a 
thing inherent in the principles of republican institutions.  
-P-A-G-E-502
502 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
The Goverment considers that the power wielded by the nation to spread 
primary education in the Provinces is so ample, in the form established by this 
projected law, that the regulations in force concerning financial subventions 
are without reason or justification. Once the Provinces have complied with 
the duty imposed upon them by the constitution in this regard up to the limit 
of their capacity the accompanying responsibility of the Federal Government 
will disappear. 
The executive, knowing the great value of the teaching profession in the gen- 
eral concert of human activities, seeks every means to establish and dignify 
the career of teacher, making it a real profession surrounded by all the honors 
and all the public considerations which it can legitimately claim, It is there- 
fore sought in the reform to fix proper conditions for different categories of 
teachers, as well as a scale of salaries, and proportional and periodic increase, 
thus guaranteeing the stability of the profession and assuring it an honorable 
and tranquil retirement. With such aims in view for the retirement of sec- 
ondary teachers, the executive has believed it equitable to establish similar 
lines of financial aid for pensions and for increase of salaries as those offered 
to the teachers of primary education. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
  Reference has been made to the establishment of intermediate 
schools, at first uniform, later differentiated, substituted for the 
former fifth and sixth years of the primary school and intended to 
bridge the chasm between the primary and the secondary schools. 
This marked a further innovation, in that secondary education had 
always been left in Argentina to the Provinces, the State nationally 
exercising only a nominal oversight of this division. For financial 
reasons, as well as because of the necessity of giving uniformity to 
a type so widely scattered, the intermediate school was from the very 
first regarded as national in scope. It may be likened in many 
respects to the junior high school of American cities. It was designed 
to give instruction of a general and cultural nature in languages, 
history, geography, and mathematics, combined with experimental 
studies in the elements of physical and natural science. Much earlier 
entrance, its advocates claimed, would thus be possible upon subjects 
of vocational and technical character, which should test the nascent 
abilities and aptitudes of the pupil. Especial attention was to be 
given woodworking, typewriting, stenography, linotyping, decora- 
tive design, photography, and special arts and crafts favored by 
local conditions, f 
This experiment, though marking an advance in educational 
methods, was unsuccessful, and after a year of existence such schools 
were discontinued. They did, however, affect instruction in secondary 
education, leaving their impress in the radical requirement of early 
specialization after the fifth and sixth higher primary grades. 
The educational policy of Argentina thus returned to its tra- 
ditional status; and secondary education still centers around the 
87 colegios nacionales, institutions for boys of 10 to 14 years of age,
-P-A-G-E-503
  ARGENTINA. 503 
which admit those with leaving certificates from the fifth and sixth 
grades of the higher primary schools, and by revisal of 1911 offer 
courses arranged by fourfold division of subjects into the physical- 
mathematical, the chemical-biological, the historical-geographical, 
and the literary-philosophical groups. A decree of the National 
Council dated February, 1916, made the certificate of sixth grade of 
the public school obligatory for admission to the colegio. This was 
regarded as going far toward settling two fundamental difficulties— 
the first, the long desired abolition of the entrance examination, as 
discredited by experience and prejudicial to secondary training, 
and the second, the official recognition of the compulsory attendance 
law for children of 6 to 14 years. 
Among the new subjects assigned for the colegios is the study of 
Italian, now restored after being abolished by previous decree. In 
accordance with this requirement, a course in this language has been 
instituted in the normal schools for the preparation of teachers. 
The close connection of the interests of the colegio nacionale with 
the university is brought out in the report of the rector of the 
National University of Buenos Aires for 1916. It is of significance 
as striking out new lines in what had always been a conservative 
division, and carried weight in the fluid state of public opinion on 
education which prevailed just at that time. 
Taking up the instructional aspect of secondary education, and 
the claims put forward by zealous partisans of the opposing views 
that the colegios should prepare either for higher studies or for 
practical life, but not for both, he urged legal provisions for both 
forms of training to supply the demand felt in all modern states for 
men of thought as well as efficiency in action. In the light of this 
demand all wrangling as to programs of study could only be to the 
damage of the State. Since the Argentine colegios half a century 
ago were modeled after the French lycées, with their emphasis upon 
the cultural studies, the world had moved far, economically and so- 
cially, and sane modifications in secondary education now clamored 
fer recognition. 
On the side of administration the peculiar question for Argentina, 
the land of great distances and many climates and productions, was 
whether the best organization for secondary instruction was the 
concentration of power in the hands of a council or of the minister 
of public instruction, or more or less complete autonomy to be 
granted to the individual institution. In either case the fixed prin- 
ciple was to be accepted that the universities were directly con- 
cerned in the discipline and studies of the students they were to 
receive, and that they should therefore have the right of intervening 
in matters of organization and studies of the colegios. 
 
-P-A-G-E-504
504 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  A just decentralization of the colegios could be easily realized 
and would bring such beneficial results as: (1) More direct and imme- 
diate action of the authorities; (2) closer articulation of the colegios 
with the universities in the matter of studies for preparation for 
the latter; (3) formation of intellectual groups that would be 
encouraged to take root permanently in the Provinces, thus avoid- 
ing the wholesale migration of the directing classes to the capital; 
(4) ease of reform, as contrasted with the present system, wherein 
every change in the program of studies was a disturbance whose 
utility was not always certain; (5) the best selection, so far as 
possible, of the personal directive staff of the colegios, as the men 
in higher education would be familiar with the problems of sec- 
ondary instruction; (6) economy of administrative expense; (7) 
the possibility of transforming certain of the colegios into schools 
of arts, trades, and industries in which general instruction, con- 
tinuing the primary, might be combined with) the special and 
technical preparation so much needed for the material well-being 
of the several regions of the Republic. 
In the projected law of public instruction, introduced in August, 
1918, itis provided that all matters relating to secondary education 
shall be under the authority of the national universities, with full 
power to regulate content of courses, curricula, etc. This is mani- 
festly a step suggested by the traditional system of Spain, in which 
the standard secondary schools (institutos) are arranged according 
to university districts and are governed by university rector and 
council. Its wisdom and advisability for a country of the Western 
Hemisphere have been variously considered. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION. 
By the projected law of August, 1918, a National Board of Tech- 
nical Education is to be established to ascertain the progress of 
this branch of education in other countries, to adapt whatever may 
be possible to the conditions and needs of Argentina, to foster 
technical instruction in the national schools, and to keep in touch 
with its progress throughout the world. 
NORMAL-SCHOOL TRAINING, 
»:(The sequence of studies prescribed for pupils of the normal school 
aceording tothe decree of March, 1916, is’ also worthy of notice. 
Immediately following, and based upon the intermediate. schools 
which,.as described above, were discarded after trial, the normal 
school required four years for the teachers’ diploma, after which 
the student might proceed to higher studies for the degree of 
 
-P-A-G-E-505
  
P ARGENTINA. 505 
teacher of modern languages in two years or that of teacher 
of languages in normal school in three years, or that of teacher 
of philosophy in any institution in six years. A commend- 
able gain of one year in each of these was effected, and this 
feature is to be embodied in the new provisions now under con- 
sideration. In addition, the new project of educational law outlines 
a teacher’s course of four years, clearly differentiating between the 
general or cultural and the pedagogical or professional courses. 
The former are assigned to the first three years as required; the 
latter are reserved for the last year, constituting an intensive cur- 
riculum of pedagogical history and methods and practice teaching 
in the required annexed practice school. The completion (1918) of 
the Normal School Sarmiento in Buenos Aires, named in honor of 
the founder of popular education in South America, is to be noted. 
This school, capable of accommodating 1,000 pupils and equipped 
with the most modern apparatus, is worthy of comparison with 
the finest schools in the other countries educationally most advanced. 
HIGHER EDUCATION, 
With the provision incorporated in the projected law, by which 
control of national secondary education is vested in the universities, 
the latter will touch national education much more intimately than 
ever before. The universities of Argentina are those of Buenos 
Aires, Cordoba, and La Plata, which are national, and those of 
Santa Fe and Tucuman, which are provincial but will soon be na- 
tionalized. In 1917 there was a growing feeling in university circles 
in favor of decentralization, with greater degree of autonomy for 
each university. The report of the rector of the university of 
Buenos Aires for 1917 was of interest as showing the effect of this 
upon the colegios as well as the universities. How far this has been 
checked by the projected provision to intrust secondary education 
to universities can not be learned. 
The unrest among the student bodies in the institutions of higher 
education has constituted perhaps the most remarkable feature of 
the educational history of the past year. In Buenos Aires reform 
was demanded in the statutes under which the university was gov- 
erned, and the adoption of methods in conformity with new tenden- 
cies in university instruction. The students demanded especially the 
right to vote for the election of the authorities. Satisfactory agree- 
ment was reached, and the university, after several days of suspen- 
sion of classes and demonstrations on the part of the student body, 
resumed instruction, which was uninterrupted for the rest of the 
year. At the University of Cordoba the conflict between the stu- 
dents and the authorities assumed more serious proportions. Regu-
-P-A-G-E-506
  506 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
lar work was suspended, the efforts of the mediator appointed by 
the National Government to hear the claims of the student body and 
to decide upon the just and practical course for the university author- 
ities to adopt were unsatisfactory to the complainants, and the au- 
thority of the minister of public instruction was invoked. Upon 
investigation the latter official advocated in his report to the execu- 
tive a complete reorganization of the university in its statutes, regu- 
lations, acts of discipline, and staff of -professors. ‘These changes 
were ratified by the executive and were practically embodied in the 
project of the law submitted to the Congress in those sections per- 
taining to university education. In the other three universities, 
those of La Plata, Tucuman, and Santa Fe, the disturbances which 
impeded the prosecution of the regular routine of studies were com- 
paratively insignificant, though the spirit of unrest was marked and 
many of the reforms and changes secured in the two leading univer- 
sities were readily accepted. 
The growth of the so-called student centers (centros estudiantiles) 
has been a feature of higher education during the past two years. 
These organizations have come to be representative of student life 
and of the student point of view, and have therefore gained much 
importance in the eyes of the authorities. They are organized ac- 
cording to departments of studies, such as the centers of medical 
and dental students, of engineering students, of political science stu- 
dents, of students of architecture, and of law. Each numbers from 
100 to 500 members. They are grouped as a whole into the Univer- 
sity. Federation of Buenos Aires, in which each is represented by 
delegates, and which is regarded as the mouthpiece of all univer- 
sity students in the metropolis. 
Plans are already under way by the executive council of the Uni- 
versity of Buenos Aires for the celebration of the first centenary of 
its foundation, which will occur in October, 1921. Invitations have 
been extended to the institutions of higher education in all countries 
of the world to designate and send representatives. Though the 
actual building of the ancient colegio nacional, in which the univer- 
sity began its operation, has been materially changed, yet the pres- 
ent building occupies the same site, and it has been decided to hold 
the centennial celebration in it. 
Of interest is the projected foundation of a popular university 
at Buenos Aires, constituted along industrial lines and frankly de- 
signed to counteract the technical and industrial influence of North 
American universities in South American countries. 
A survey of educational progress in Argentina may fittingly con- 
clude with mention of the annual American Congress of Education . 
and Commercial Extension, held in Montevideo in January, 1919,

in which representatives of all the Latin-American countries par- 
ticipated, and those of Argentina, from her economic and educational 
leadership, were most prominent. The proceedings of the congress 
will be discussed in the chapter on Uruguay.

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. 
Educational activity in Brazil has been most marked in the field 
of vocational education. A special commission, appointed by the 
Director General of Public Instruction, consisting of five experienced 
teachers in subjects of this nature, was instructed to formulate 
courses for the State schools which were to be established by law in 
the Federal District. They were to serve as models for subsequent 
schools of the same character in the several States and Territories. 
The commission, of which Senhor Coryntho da Fonseca was the 
spokesman, after several months of conference and personal visits of 
inspection to the vocational schools already existent in the several 
centers, especially in Sao Paulo, and after hearing reports from active 
teachers in the subjects, presented its report in March, 1919. It was 
approved by the Vice President, serving ad interim for the Presi- 
dent, and was recommended by him to be put into actual operation 
pending its formal enactment into law by the Congress. 
The report as finally presented rested upon four main considera- 
tions: : 
1. The State, in the field of instruction, has primarily an educa- 
tional function and only secondarily a vocational one. Courses in 
shop training, designed to awake and develop an aptitude in the 
pupil for a particular industry, must of course enter into any well- 
rounded scheme of education. This in turn must be designed to 
promote a general and not a specialized technical education which 
will introduce both sexes to industrial and commercial life. For 
practical reasons of expense, if for no other, the State should not 
be expected to prepare pupils for specialized vocations. 
2. The task of the commission being to deal with the branches of 
vocational training best adapted to give the pupil a broad outlook 
upon general industrial activities, the commission judged it best to 
confine its recommendations to manual work of construction in wood, 
metal, and plastic material. In methods as well as content of in- 
struction it is emphasized that such work must proceed along the 
lines of teaching by example, In such teaching much that is old 
and fundamental must be stressed by way of throwing light upon the 
elements of the training that are common to all branches of manual 
arts.

3. In its decision to urge a general attitude toward industrial train- 
ing rather than specialized methods peculiar to one branch, the com- 
mission was confirmed by the testimony of all except one of the di- 
rectors of the vocational institutions in Brazil. Only one advocated 
specialized instruction. Written representations of the faculties of 
the vocational schools Alvaro Baptista, and Souza Aguiar, in Rio, 
further confirmed this view. 
4. The results of vocational instruction in Brazil as actually ob- 
served within the last few years convinced the commission— 
(a) That unspecialized training best provided the foundations for 
good citizenship as well as industrial training. 
(6) That by this training the latent technical aptitudes of the 
student were more effectively revealed and developed, as shown by 
steady increase in salaries of the graduates, than was the case with the 
apprentices who had been trained exclusively in one line. 
(ce) That the superior adaptation of the graduates of the general 
vocational school had been shown by tables giving information as to 
their progress in skill.and value to their employers. These tables 
were naturally incomplete, but their general drift was undeniable. 
(d) That the chief cause of the poor attendance upon the voca- 
tional instruction for boys is the prevalent idea that the vocational 
school is an index of lower social standing, enrolling only those boys 
that can not obtain any other means of education. Thus the voca- 
tional school is sharply differentiated socially from other types of 
schools. It suffers from being regarded as preeminently the school 
to train workmen. The commission had in mind the purpose of pre- 
paring public sentiment for the passing of this traditional prejudice 
when it attempted to inspire a just estimate of manual work in the 
public mind and to organize such courses as would adequately carry 
out this idea. 
(e) That the vocational school must be established as a direct con- 
tinuation of the primary school, ministering to the innate tendency 
in the child to realize things with his own hands; that thus the tra- 
ditional and depressing prejudice mentioned would be counteracted, 
as time would not be given for it to intervene in the child’s mind. 
The workshop, thus articulated with general training, would come to 
be the fulfillment of an aspiration, inculcating as well the love of 
work and respect for it. 
(f) That the success of the projected schools depends largely 
upon the cooperation of the industrial firms of Brazil, which should 
be appealed to for their sympathy and for the encouragement of 
their adolescent employees to attend these schools; that the grant- 
ing of daylight hours to employees to attend such schools, as has 
been done in England and France, with the consequent improve-
-P-A-G-E-509

ment in the physical and mental condition of the pupils, is a step 
to be commended to all employers as patriotic citizens.

EDUCATION IN CHILE. 
PRELIMINARY. 
The last two years have seen in Chile.a distinct gathering up of 
the threads of educational purpose. The feeling of dissatisfaction 
with the primary school system, for many years inarticulate, has 
found a voice, and all signs point to Chile’s finally securing a mod- 
ernized system of public instruction. The head and front of the 
indictment drawn by national students of education has been the 
complete Germanization of the system through the employment of a 
considerable number of German educational experts during the de-  
-P-A-G-E-512
    512 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
cade from 1904 to 1914. The climax came in the revelations of the 
propagandist activities of the German educators brought out at the 
meeting of the National Educational Association in 1917. 
Financial support of public instruction in Chile has never been 
stinted, so far as its existent state was concerned. As merely one 
item may be adduced the fact that in March, 1916, the Congress 
authorized the President to devote to public instruction for specific 
aims such as the building and remodeling of schoolhouses, $4,000,000 
annually for 10 years, through the medium of the Central Council of 
Education, in which was vested the discretion as to methods and 
objects of the expenditure. In 1918 the budget was voted by the 
Congress of $35,450,000 for public instruction, as against that of 
$32,373,404 for 1917. So that the authorities of the Government 
must justly be credited with a practical interest in education which 
encourages teachers and other active workers in their efforts toward 
greater efficiency. \ 
In 1917 there had been increased discussion of matters educa- 
tional; and in June of that year President Sanfuentes in his mes- 
sage showed that the time had come to impress on the national sys- 
tem of public instruction a more practical stamp, making it adequate 
to the needs of everyday life and the special conditions of the coun- 
try. Along with this he urged the specialization of secondary educa- 
tion as, just then, the urgent and opportune point of attack for the 
development of Chile’s scientific and industrial possibilities. 
This message was followed by action of the Congress which clearly 
showed the traditional line of cleavage long prevailing in Chile’s 
social and political system. The demand for some form of modernized 
public instruction could no longer be repressed; and a conservative 
deputy introduced the project of a law to insert in the constitu- 
tion a provision for compulsory primary schooling and compulsory 
religious instruction, the only modification of the latter being the 
concession to the parent to choose the forms and means of such in- 
struction, The radical party was not slow in countering with a 
project adopting the feature of compulsory attendance but decen- 
tralizing and completely secularizing the existing system. The lat- 
ter proposal, now made for the first time in the history of Chilean 
legislation, was especially bold, as Chile has never done away with the 
essentially religious tone of her education. She retains representa- 
tives of the State church on her National Council of Education, 
freely recognizes parochial primary schools, and has her secondary 
schools largely managed by religious instructors and under distinc- 
tively religious auspices. 
The compromise bill formulated by a specially appointed commis- 
sion of the Congress sought to satisfy both extremes. It vested su- 
’
-P-A-G-E-513
  CHILE. 513 
preme administrative authority in educational matters in a council 
of 18, sitting in Santiago, presided over by the Minister of Justice 
and Instruction; but it allowed 11 of the members to be named by 
the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, and the President of the Re- 
public. This feature was severely criticized by the liberals and by 
the National Educational Association as still keeping educational au- 
thority in the hands of politicians, not intrusting it to men really 
interested in education, and making it possible to block all eduea- 
tional progress whenever desired. 
The bill made four years’ attendance in primary schools, private 
or public, compulsory for all children between 7 and 13, and required 
all reaching the latter age without completing the prescribed course 
to continue until 15. Poverty could.not be pleaded in excuse, as 
grants by the State were specified and graduated in amounts accord- 
ing toneed. Exemption from religious instruction was allowed upon 
written application of the parent or upon certification of the local 
junta, another feature opposed by the National Educational Associa- 
tion on the ground that the junta’s powers could never be so ampli- 
fied legally. Programs of study and schedules should be under the 
authority of the inspector general of primary instruction. Primary 
instruction was to be imparted to complete illiterates in schools called 
supplementary, managed independently of existing primary schools, 
and to partial illiterates in schools called complementary, conducted 
in conjunction with existent primary schools. 
The bill, as outlined above, encountered opposition from many 
sources, and still remains unenacted. Pending its passage, the 
Minister of Public Instruction, by virtue of the power vested in him, 
issued in 1918 a decree organizing primary education in three grades 
of two years each, continued by one grade of vocational education 
of from one to three years. Attendance is not specifically compulsory, 
though the local junta has power so to declare it in the schools of its 
jurisdiction. The requirements as to qualifications of a primary 
teacher are made more rigorous; he must be a citizen of Chile, of good 
character, not less than 18 nor more than 40 years of age at the time 
of appointment, and a graduate of a Government normal school, or 
holding a degree of a Chilean or recognized foreign institution. 
ILLITERACY. * 
The problem of illiteracy in Chile is a serious one, the estimated 
figures for 1917 showing 959,061 illiterates out of a total population 
of 3,249,279. Since the year 1900 the struggle against it has grown in 
vigor. The National Educational Association has shown especial 
efficiency, and has worked through committees having the following 
phases in charge: Compulsory school attendance, the legal require- 
171030°—21—Bull, 89-33
-P-A-G-E-514
514 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916—1918, 
  ments, condition of the schools and the teaching force, school revenues, 
school buildings and sanitation, and special education. 
This steady pressure prepared public sentiment for the leadership 
of the most influential agency ever invoked in the fight against illiter- 
acy, viz, the conferences ‘organized by the powerful newspaper 
El Mercurio. Under its auspices these conferences were held in a 
3-days’ series in July, 1917, and were attended and participated in 
by men and women identified with every phase of national educa- 
tion. The following topics were the salient ones of those discussed : 
1. Comparative study of illiteracy statistics in various countries. 
2. Means of combating illiteracy in leading nations. 
8. Practicable means of action in Chile. 
4, Means of contribution, and proportion in which the State, the 
municipal authorities, and the Provinces may contribute to 
the budget necessary. 
. Cooperation of private initiative. 
. Means of making school attendance compulsory. 
Regulation of child labor. 
Reforms necessary in actual plans of study and in classifica- 
tion of schools. 
Necessity and practical means of giving the schools a more 
Nationalistic character. 
10. Minimum of knowledge to be required by compulsory attend- 
ance law. 
11. Place of night schools, Sunday schools, and traveling schools, 
in the struggle against illiteracy. 
While no action of a legal character resulted from these confer- 
ences, yet the impetus given to the cause was powerful, and had 
weight in bringing about the decree and the projected law already 
outlined. Such a move, combining at once social and economic as 
well as educational characteristics, seeking to bring public opinion 
to bear on the solution of a problem underlying the life of a nation, 
and launched by a newspaper, is unique in the history of education. 
The Territory of Magellanes has shown itself remarkably efficient 
in handling the problem of illiteracy. It is the southernmost area of 
the country, and little favored by nature, being a long strip of 
barren and rocky coast, with a climate singularly bleak and un- 
inviting. Its industries are based exclusively upon its mineral re- 
sources; and its population, though intelligent, is very sparse. By 
the census of 1917, its percentage of illiteracy was 20; according 
to the estimate of the author of a study of the Territory, published 
in the Anales de la Universidad, April, 1918, this has been reduced 
to 7 per cent. Credit is largely due the Society of Popular Instruc- 
tion, a private organization, established in 1911, which offers free OADM ©
-P-A-G-E-515
  CHILE. 515 
instruction to pupils of all ages. In spite of the prevailing in- 
clemency of the climate, the sessions of its day and night schools 
are excellently attended. The system is centralized in Punta 
Arenas. 
PRIMARY EDUCATION. 
Unlike Argentina and Brazil, primary public education has al- 
ways been left in the hands of the central national government, the 
individual Province having control of financial outlay and the con- 
struction of school buildings, and this only when requirements of 
the national law are fulfilled. Uniform programs of study and 
schedules of hours are enforced throughout the nation. But condi- 
tions of scarcity of materials and labor render it impossible to keep 
many of the old buildings in repair. The tendency long criticized 
by the Association of Teachers, to cram school buildings into the half 
dozen larger centers, seems in a fair way to be checked.* 
This new order of things is most plainly seen in the attention 
paid to rural schools, which have predominated in the number built 
since 1916. The Government has instructed the committee on public 
works and the department of primary instruction to develop a plan 
of building uniform types of rural school. The expenses are to be 
borne out of the fund just mentioned. Three types are contem- 
plated, with a capacity of 80, 160, and 400 pupils respectively, sol- 
idly constructed, conforming strictly to all modern demands of sani- 
tation, lighting, and heating. In many places the North American 
principle of consolidation of schools has been applied, to the dis- 
tinct improvement of attendance and instruction, 200 small and 
struggling schools having been abolished and 100 annexed to others 
more centrally situated. With these gains, however, the crying 
need in Chile is acknowledged to be more schools. ‘It is estimated 
that 10,000 elementary schools are yet needed for her approxi- 
mately 750,000 children, of whom slightly less than 400,000 are in 
the schools of this grade, and 50,000 in private parochial schools. 
All educational thinkers are agreed that the situation calls for legal 
compulsory attendance on primary instruction, rigidly enforced. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION, 
Secondary education in Chile is organized in three grades: (1) 
National high schools; (2) liceos of the second class, and (3) com- 
plete liceos of the first class. 
(1) The high schools are a development of the last few years, and 
are situated only in the larger centers. They number 30 for boys   
1 Criticism has been freely expressed in the public press of the use of a disproportion- 
ately large part of the primary school fund voted by the Congress for the use of the 
executive.
-P-A-G-E-516
  516 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
and 12 for girls, enrolling less than 12,000 pupils, and are generally 
little more than higher elementary schools. They are almost ex- 
clusively technical, and do not prepare the pupil for advanced 
study. 
(2) The liceos of the second class (sometimes called colegios), of 
which about 100 exist in the Provinces and Territories, offer courses 
covering three years in the elementary subjects of instruction com- 
mon to scientific and literary groups. 
(3) The liceos of the first class, numbering 40 for boys and 31 
for girls, and offering the full course of six years, are representa- 
tive of the best in secondary education in Latin-America. Those 
for boys, following the tradition of the Spanish system for corre- 
sponding schools, are administered by the University of Chile; 
those for girls, by the Minister of Public Instruction and the National 
Council. The practical and scientific wave which swept over this 
division of education in 1915 caused the reinforcement of physical 
and chemical teaching. Spanish, history and geography, religion 
(optional), French, mathematics, natural sciences, gymnastics and 
singing, and manual training run through all six years of the course; 
English (or German or Italian), philosophy, civics, penmanship and 
drawing, mechanical drawing (optional), extend through varying 
numbers of years. Students of secondary education are struck with 
the excessive number of hours required weekly, the minimum being 
29 for the first year and the maximum 383 for each of the last three 
years. 
The essential purpose of the liceo of the first class is to prepare 
for the university, or for the professions; and national scholarships 
are granted, including maintenance at the hostels, or annexed board- 
ing halls which were established five years ago. 
The system of ‘secondary education has long been criticized by 
Chilean educational thinkers as being too largely mental and literary, 
and as paying little, if any, attention to the physical and moral. The 
attempt to organize sports and physical exercises in secondary edu- 
cation has met far less encouragement than in other South American 
countries. 
By decree of May, 1917, classes for illiterate girls over 7 years 
old were annexed to liceos for girls, the ministry basing the number 
to be admitted upon the attendance of the year previous. This 
was stoutly opposed by the National Educational Association as 
being a confusion of classification, a violation of the continuity 
of the educational system, and an evasion of the palpable duty of 
the schoo] authorities, which should press the Government to estab- 
lish fitting and proper schools for such illiterate girls. 
The Government has appointed a commission of prominent men 
for the study of reforms necessary and advisable for programs of
-P-A-G-E-517
  CHILE. 517 
secondary education for girls. As matters stand, the same programs 
of study are set for both boys and girls, a traditional arrangement 
the disadvantages of which are coming fully to be recognized. 
Despite unfavorable and antiquated programs of studies, the Prov- 
ince of Nuble has made noteworthy progress in female secondary 
education. In Chillan, its capital, are conducted four liceos, three 
of which are for girls. Ambitious courses in the classics, social 
sciences, and rudimentary science are offered. One of them, the In- 
stituto Pedagogico, founded in 1912, exercises far-reaching influence 
over the social, moral, and artistic conditions of the Province. The 
American Liceo, a private institution, conducted by teachers from 
the United States, devotes especial attention to the teaching of 
English, colloquial and literary, and also gives instruction generally’ 
along thoroughly modern high-school lines. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS, 
Chile’s system of training teachers is distinctively eclectic, borrow- 
ing, as it has done, from France, Sweden, Germany, and the United 
States. Before 1870 French influence predominated, the great Ar- 
gentine educator, Sarmiento, himself a pupil of the school of Saint- 
Simon, having founded the first normal school in 1842 while in 
exile from the tyranny of the dictator Rosas. German influence 
became pronounced about 1880, when that nation began to supply 
men and women teachers in the normals and as instructors in all 
grades of education. Since 25 years ago the tide began to turn 
toward North American influence, especially of the type of edu- 
cation developed in the Northwestern States. The Chilean ideal 
is a judicious combination of (1) an institution for the training of 
teachers for public schools who shall have adequate culture, special- 
ized training, manual skill, and theoretical and practical knowledge 
of modern subjects, and (2) an institution for training in social rela- 
tions and habits, exercising steady influence on the social environ- 
ment of the school by means of popular courses and conferences, 
and participation in popular movements. 
The full course in the 16 training colleges for teachers covers 
five years, of which the first three are devoted to general education 
and the last two to professional training. The course for the fifth 
year is essentially professional, consisting of pedagogy (history, 
methodology, and practice teaching), 17 hours weekly; Spanish, 1 
hour; English or French or German, 4 hours; civics and economics, 
2 hours; hygiene, 2 hours; horticulture or metallography, 2 hours; 
drawing, 1 hour; manual arts, 2 hours; music, 1 hour; physical edu- 
cation, 3 hours. All expenses are defrayed, in return for which the. 
pupil is pledged to teach for seven years in the national schools.

The actual method of instruction is along German lines. Object 
lessons, those in natural history and history and geography have all 
impressed recent foreign visitors as essentially Herbartian. Per- 
haps in no other country of the world, since the well-drilled German 
schools fell into chaos, is the influence of the normal schools upon the 
system and method of public instruction more powerful than in 
Chile. Indeed, this potent influence has overleaped the boundaries 
of Chile proper and affected every country of Latin America. A 
supreme example is the influence of the Instituto Pedagogico, the 
best known of Chilean normal schools, founded in 1909, with pre- 
dominatingly German faculty, which has developed into a type of 
higher normal school with a colegio annexed, emphasizing practice 
teaching with subsequent criticism and courses of general pedagogy 
and methodology in every subject. Its certificates rank highest in 
the secondary and normal education of the capital city; students are 
attracted to it from the other Latin-American States, and return 
home to reorganize education there along its lines. Its boast is that 
it inspired the establishment of the Instituto Nacional at Buenos 
Aires, 
Scandinavian and Beigian influences are at work im the Instituto 
de Profesores Especiales. Established in 1906, it was definitely re- 
organized in 1910 and installed in the building especially constructed 
for it. Of its 300 pupils 200 are women, and the majority of both 
men and women are active teachers in the schools of the capital. It 
offers courses common to all the specialized sections, such as psy- 
chology, French, pedagogy, civics, and school legislation, and in- 
cludes five sections, fundamental to its organization: Physical edu- 
cation, manual arts, drawing and penmanship, domestic economy, 
and vocal music. For the convenience of teachers, instruction is 
given from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 4 to 8 p. m. 
The last few years have seen wide extension of the demand for 
rural normal schools, and many critics of the existent schools have 
urged that they follow those of the State of Wisconsin asa model. The 
essential solidarity of educational aims of the South American repub- 
lies is shown by the fact that Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia during 
the same period drew their inspiration from the same North Amer- 
ican source. 
The decree already mentioned under the head of primary educa- 
tion emphasizes the duty of the normal schools to prepare free of 
all expense primary teachers for any of the three grades of in- 
struction. Each normal school is also required to have annexed 
such specially organized practice schools as shall be necessary. At 
the discretion of the President of the Republic, the normal schools 
shall offer special courses for those students who have passed the 
examinations of the fifth year of the colegios, with the aim of at-
-P-A-G-E-519
  
CHILE. 519 
tracting such students into the field of teaching. That the need 
of wider training of the teachers is a pressing one in Chile is shown 
by the fact that, in 1915, of 3,000 rural teachers, only 350, and of 
6,240 primary teachers of the nation at large, only 2,435, had normal 
school training. The service had to be recruited by 2,000 graduates 
of primary schools who passed examinations, and by 1,850 appli- 
eants who held no certificate and were allowed to serve as temporary 
substitutes. 
Of special interest is the annual reciprocity of teachers between 
the Government of Chile and the Universities of the States of Cali- 
fornia and Washington, arranged in 1918. Each party is to send 
four. For the present the Chilean commission has expressed pre- 
dominant interest in secondary education, and has called for one 
university professor, one normal-school teacher, one teacher of 
technical subjects, and one teacher (preferably a woman) in sec- 
ondary education. The universities mentioned will act as the agents 
in the selection of the instructors. 
Interchange of university professors has also been arranged with 
Uruguay, which is for the present confined to medical instruction. 
The National Educational Association has at many meetings 
pressed for the scientific and practical training of the teachers of 
Chile in vocational studies; and for the appropriation by the Con- 
gress of a definite sum for sending normal teachers abroad for study 
in the modern practical and sociological subjects. 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION, 
For this branch of education the National Educational Associa- 
tion in 1917 recommended that there be established by law a Council 
of Industrial Education composed of a director and 12 members, 
four of whom shall be professors of the fundamental technical 
branches, one a woman inspector of vocational schools for women, 
one an inspector general of primary education, one the director 
general of railroads, and one a director and inspector of army muni- 
tions. Their duties should be to exercise superintendency over the 
entire system of technical and industrial education to be organized 
in the Republic, over the national school of arts and trades, and 
over such industrial schools for girls and women as might be es- 
tablished. On this board should be likewise all inspectors and 
officials of such branches as might be later established. A bill em- 
bodying these provisions was introduced in the Congress but has 
not as yet been acted upon. * 
Steady progress in all branches of technical education has been 
shown. The schools of higher primary grade offering technical
-P-A-G-E-520
520 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
courses number 288, with physical training and gymnastics com- 
pulsory in all grades. There were also in operation 29 technical 
colegios for women; 6 agricultural colegios; 10 commercial schools, 
controlled by the commission upon commercial education; and 3 
schools of mines. 
The department of industrial promotion has urged upon the 
Congress the establishment of a chain of industrial and agricultural 
schools. 
With the establishment by law of the Industrial University of 
Valparaiso there will be completed the full cycle of industrial edu- 
cation in Chile, consisting of: (1) Elementary industrial training 
in two schools already established and in six more to be established; 
(2) secondary industrial training in the School of Arts and Crafts; 
and (8) higher industrial training in the Technical School of 
Valparaiso. 
In November, 1918, met the first National Congress of Dairying, 
organized under the auspices of the Agronomic Society of Chile. It 
urged the legal organization of instruction in this branch in (1) spe- 
cial schools of dairying in northern and central Chile; (2) courses 
annexed to already established schools of agriculture; (8) in estab- 
lishments of secondary education for youths of both sexes in popular 
meetings and public traveling courses; (4) in rural primary schools 
for illiterate adults. 
It is appropriate to mention just here the comprehensive project 
of the board of missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church of the 
United States for the establishment of an agricultural and industrial 
system of education in southern Chile. It has been approved by 
the Government of Chile as a potent aid in the uplift of the peon 
class. A ranch of nearly 4,000 acres has been purchased along the 
Malleco River, on which it is purposed to train the native popu- 
lation in the rudimentary subjects of instruction, and especially in 
modern agricultural methods. The management will employ the best 
available experts in horticulture, agriculture, and domestic arts to 
be found in the South American countries who may be acquainted 
with the needs of Chilean rural life. 
THE NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHILE. 
This body plays a larger part in educational thought and leader- 
ship than the corresponding body in any other Latin American 
State. Its activities are planned for close articulation of the social 
and educational needs of the nation. One of the furthest reaching 
- is the public-extension work in subjects of university and secondary 
instruction. In 1917, its eleventh year of operation, it held 14 con- 
ferences at the University of Chile, with an attendance of 15,000, an
-P-A-G-E-521
  CHILE. 521 
increase of 50 per cent over the previous year. The subjects treated 
were patriotic, historical, literary, artistic, sociological, commercial, 
and medico-therapeutic. 
In secondary extension during 1917 there were held in provincial 
capitals 19 conferences on subjects more popular and more exclu- 
sively educational and sociological. 
The department of university extension has also for three years 
devoted itself to collecting international data upon immigration and 
naturalization laws, and has cooperated with all the labor organiza- 
tions of the Republic to hinder the passage of premature and unsci- 
entific laws in this field. 
The activities of the association cover a wide range. In his report 
for the year 1917 the president reviewed the activities of the body 
and examined the most important problems to which it had ad- 
dressed itself during the period. They were: 
1. The establishment of a rural normal school, a project not yet 
realized. 
2. Democratic education by the progressive elimination of pri- 
mary courses of education in secondary institutions. 
8. Obligatory primary instruction, sought by a law passed by the 
Chamber of Deputies in 1917, but as yet not acted upon by 
the Senate. 
4, Nationalization of the Chilean system of education, a question 
which needs to be presented still more in detail to the nation 
and the Congress. 
Like Argentina, Chile has a grave problem in the assimilation of 
alien elements, and her nationalism is alarmed at the activity of the 
school organizations of diverse races existent on her soil. French 
students of education are intensely interested in this development 
as a vindication of their prophecies, for they have long been point- 
ing out the Germanization of Chilean education. 
The association has vigorously urged legislation requiring the 
close and systematic inspection of all nongovernmental schools, es- 
pecially those of secondary grade in north Chile, where German 
propaganda has for years been an open secret, carried on, as was 
well known, by a German-Chilean Union of Teachers, and where 
German liceos exist in full operation. The association urged the 
requirement in secondary schools of esseutially national subjects, 
such as Spanish and the history, geography, and civics of Chile, 
taught by Chileans and descendants of Chileans. 
In the field of physical education, the activities of the association 
have been specially directed to securing proper playgrounds for 
schools and to arousing practical interest in this field among philan- 
thropists and the public at large. The association has taken strong 
ground for antialcoholic instruction in primary and secondary 
 
-P-A-G-E-522
  522 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
schools, urging that such be incorporated in the textbooks in the 
study of physiology, hygiene, and temperance, and in independent 
courses in public schools and State colegios. The project encoun- 
tered opposition in the National Congress. The association has also 
grappled with the problem of immorality, issuing in May, 1917, 
appeals to families on sexual ethics and the systematic inculcation 
of ethical ideas of sex by educational and therapeutic measures. 
During 1917, fraternal relations were established with Brazil and 
Bolivia, on the occasion of the inauguration of the Higher Normal 
Institute. 
EDUCATION IN URUGUAY, 
GENERAL INTRODUCTION, 
The marked educational awakening of Uruguay during the last 
biennium has been only one phase of the universal demand of the 
nation for a new social and economic adjustment. Perhaps the chief 
manifestation of this has been the adoption of the new constitution 
in place of the old, which had been in force exactly 90 years. At a 
plebiscite of November, 1917, the constitution as formulated was sub- 
mitted to the people and adopted by a vote of 85,000 to 4,000; and 
it became the fundamental law of the land on March 1, 1919. As 
regards its bearings upon educational administration, the most note- 
worthy change—and perhaps that around which centered most op- 
position during its consideration—was the provision which divides 
the executive power between a President and a National Council of 
Administration. 
The latter body, composed of nine members elected for six years 
directly by the people, and absolutely independent of the President, 
has charge of all matters relating to public instruction, public works, 
labor, industries, public charities, health, and the preparation of the 
annual national budget. The administrative officers of public in- 
struction of all grades, including the minister, are appointed by the 
National Council and are subject to its authority according to such 
particular laws and.regulations as the Congress may enact. This sub- 
stitution of a composite board for an individual as the fountainhead 
of educational authority is an experiment whose operations will be 
cbserved with much interest in a country of South America habitu- 
ated by tradition to authority concentrated in an individual. 
ILLITERACY. 
Instruction of adults and the night schools.—The problem of com- 
bating illiteracy, as in all the more progressive South American 
countries during the last biennium, has received more systematic con-
-P-A-G-E-523
  URUGUAY. 523 
sideration than during any previous period.‘ As will be seen later 
in the consideration of the rural schools, measures have been taken 
which are of unusual importance for the instruction of youthful illit- 
erates. In the related field of instruction of adults who are illiterates 
or nearly so, work of a creative nature has been done in Uruguay. 
The mere statistics show progress, the courses offered for adults in the 
year 1916-17 being 55 in excess of the former year and the enrollment 
5,284, an increase of 1,671 over that year; but the new spirit ani- 
mating this branch is the notable feature. The authorities have kept 
it steadily in mind to carry adult education out from the capital city 
to the rural districts; and the national authorities of primary edu- 
cation have cooperated efficiently in lending schoolhouses as places 
for’ adult instruction and encouraging primary teachers to assist 
in this work. The Government has furthered the study of the prob- 
lem in the researches of Sefior Hipolito Coirolo, director of the 
largest night school for adults in Montevideo. Sefior Coirolo spent 
nearly two years in collecting systematic data from Argentina, Bra- 
zil, Colombia, and Paraguay, which were naturally confronted by the 
same problems in adult illiteracy. In March, 1917, he presented to 
the authorities the results of his findings in a project for the organic 
reform of instruction for adults in the night schools. Sefior Coirolo 
maintained that the time was ripe for progress in this field to keep 
pace with the other educational demands, more especially as it 
was admitted that the prevailing system was a more or less poorly 
made combination of regulations and practices covering many locali- 
ties and periods, and had been only tentatively adopted by presi- 
dential decree in 1903, and given legal existence in 1907, when 35 
night schools were organized. All familiar with conditions knew_ 
that they were now completely out of touch with modern social and 
educational demands. 
Sefior Coirolo found the curriculum of night schools too largely 
theoretical and bookish and in only a few instances offering practi- 
cal instruction. After careful study of the subjects offered in the 
night schools of progressive countries, he urged that the night schools 
of the future be organized upon the following main lines: 
1. The completion of 17 years of age requisite for admission. 
2. The division into three classes, each occupying a year according 
‘to the degree of illiteracy, and the division of each class into three 
cycles of three months each, the cycle to be the unit of time, without 
limitation upon the transfer of pupils from one cycle to another. 
8. The subjects to be introduced in logical sequence and to be 
taught in accordance with the development of the pupil and to con- 
1 See executive message of May, 1917, accompanying project of law for appropriation 
.of $50,000 for appointment of 100 assistant primary teachers for the Departments of the 
Republic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-524
  524 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
sist of reading; language work, writing, arithmetic, elements of ap- 
plied geometry, singing, drawing, moral instruction, elements of 
anatomy, physiology, hygiene, civic instruction, geography, and his- 
tory (national and universal) ; talks and lessons on objects of daily 
life, manual arts, domestic economy, and household arts; elements of 
political economy, sociology, psychology, duties of parents, account- 
ing, and industrial training. Individual conferences with teachers, 
reading, writing, and arithmetic are to be continued through all three 
years; and each year is to close with a review and finishing course, 
devoting attention to individual needs. 
4. Under the head of general administration the proponent urged 
the elimination of religious instruction in night schools, less atten- 
tion to examinations for promotion, the prohibition of holding night 
schools in buildings occupied by children during the day, and careful 
inspection of night schools by appointed authorities. 
Certain of these provisions were embodied in a ministerial decree 
of October, 1917, which stressed the importance of this branch of 
education in the national life, and appropriated $10,000 for the in- 
crease of the staff of teachers in commercial subjects and domestic 
arts. 
PRIMARY EDUCATION, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, 
In 1917 slightly less than 100,000 pupils were enrolled in the 1,014 
public primary schools of Uruguay, an increase of 2,500 over the 
preceding year. Of these, nearly 65,000 were enrolled in the city of 
Montevideo alone. 
In administration and inspection the authorities in this field were 
active and progressive. Tentative reforms in the programs of study 
for the schools of towns and villages, a step long urged by them, were 
outlined by the minister of education ; and wider latitude was allowed 
such individual schools in the matter of adapting nature study and 
practical courses to regular school work in accordance with local 
conditions and occupations. This step was in keeping with the at- 
tention paid to rural schools, which will be discussed later. 
By executive resolution of July, 1917, the long-discussed change in 
the school year was made by which it shall hereafter open March 1 
and close December 15. As with the similar change in Argentina, 
beneficial results, especially in the rural schools, are expected, as this 
arrangement is in conformity with climatic conditions. The change 
was made after investigation among the teaching force, and the coun- 
try teachers won a victory over their city fellows, who favored vaca- 
tions in the summer. This is but another and a significant effect of 
the steady centripetal attraction of the overshadowing capital city, 
more marked even in the new countries of South America than in the
-P-A-G-E-525
  URUGUAY. 525 
old ones of Europe. The country teachers have openly expressed 
their wish to spend the longest posisble time in the capital, in spite 
of the inconveniences of such a sojourn in the summer. A further 
light upon the country teacher’s point of view is shown by the in- 
formation that the long vacations in winter permit the small land- 
owner to employ his children in labors of battage, which begin in 
December and last most of the winter. The schools are therefore 
practically empty in winter. It is manifestly wiser to put the former 
Jong vacation of July at this time. 
Complaints having become more frequent in regard to the blocking 
» of educational administration in certain departments because of dis~ 
agreements among inspectors, more drastic requirements were laid 
down by resolutions of the National Inspection of Primary In- 
struction, dated February, 1917. The authority of the departmental 
inspector over the subinspectors was confirmed; in the event of 
disagreement or insubordination the departmental inspector’ was 
required to present the case to the Department of National Inspec- 
tion; the visitation of schools was distributed as nearly equally as 
possible; and the responsibility for inaction was put squarely upon 
the inspectors. 
These provisions, rigorous as they were, did not prove adequate, 
and much of the business of the schools of the outlying departments 
still remained blocked. The executive, therefore, in November, 1917, 
transmitted to the Congress, along with a message emphasizing the 
necessity of the law, a project for the establishment of three divi- 
sions of regional inspectors of primary education to exercise general 
supervision over the departmental inspectors and the schools of the 
Republic. These regional inspectors acting as a unit were to con- 
stitute the technical inspection of the school authorities. Their func- 
tions were to be regulated by the executive in accordance with the 
reports of the national inspection and the general direction of pri- 
mary instruction. The hitherto existing chief inspectors, technical, 
adjunct, and chief of statistics were to be transformed into regional 
inspectors, and under their immediate supervision were to be put all 
the departmental inspectors. The projected law encountered un- 
expected opposition, and its passage has not as yet been secured. 
Scientific interest in the character of the textbooks adopted for use 
in the primary schools of Uruguay has been aroused by the Govern- 
ment’s offer of prizes for satisfactory textbooks and by the publica- 
tion in the Anales de Instruccion Primaria of illustrative lines and 
themes of treatment. The general assembly has authorized the offer 
of $6,000 in prizes in the contest for the composition of a book com- 
bining in a single volume all the textbook material needed in the 
fourth, fifth, and sixth classes in the public schools of Montevideo. 
This offer had as its object to lower the cost of education and thus to 
 
-P-A-G-E-526
  526 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  facilitate attendance, as the book in question was to be distributed 
gratuitously in cases of need. 
A circular issued by the department of technical inspection in 
April, 1917, called the attention of teachers to the abuses of assigning 
written home work and limited such tasks to 30 minutes in classes of 
the first grade and to one hour for those in higher grades. 
By executive decree, school savings funds and a system of aid for 
necessitous children, supplying clothing, midday meal, transporta- 
tion, and books, were established and placed in charge of the admin- 
istrative council for each department, composed of the departmental 
authorities of primary education, and the civil authorities of the 
several localties, presided over by the departmental inspectors. The 
funds for the institution of this system were to be drawn from State. 
subventions to municipalities, school fees, and legacies and gifts to 
such objects. Although the Congress in October, 1917, appropriated 
$30,000 to organize the system, financial considerations have as yet 
prevented its practical organization. 
Private instruction —For the first time in the history of Uruguay 
systematic steps have been taken to ascertain the real nature and 
aims of private instruction. By executive decree of May, 1917, the 
inspector of private instruction and the assistant director general 
of primary public instruction were directed to address to every 
private educational institution in Uruguay a questionnaire in dupli- 
cate calling for information concerning its teaching staff, the mental 
and physical condition of its pupils, the hygienic conditions of the 
building and site, classrooms, dormitories, playgrounds, source and 
nature of drinking water, lighting conditions, school furniture and 
equipment, programs of study, methods, textbooks, school hours, 
and the general organization and administration of the school. No 
time limit was set for the reply, but it was requested within a 
reasonable time. The gist of the information gathered and the 
action of the Government have not as yet been published. Such a 
move has naturally aroused opposition in conservative and ecclesias- 
tical circles, and its results are awaited with keen interest by other 
South American countries which have to deal with similar problems. 
The issues aroused by the consideration of the private schools 
continued to grow more acute, and culminated in the introduction 
of a bill in the Congress in March, 1918, forbidding the opening 
of private schools of any grade without the written permission of 
the inspectoral department of private instruction or the depart- 
mental inspectors of primary instruction; and requiring all teachers 
in private schools to hold a State teacher’s diploma in accordance 
with the provisions of the law of public instruction, and debarring 
the clergy from teaching in any such private schools. The bill 
naturally became a storm center and is as yet unenacted into law.

RURAL SCHOOLS. 
Until the breaking out of the World War, and the consequent 
upsetting of traditions in all South American countries whose outlet 
is on the Atlantic Ocean, educational thought in Uruguay concerned 
itself largely with the capital city. In this respect, as in that of 
population (one out of three people in Uruguay lives in Monte- 
video), the centralizing tendency of South American countries is 
well illustrated. But a vital change began to show itself from 
1914 to 1916, and in the latter year it acquired extraordinary im- 
petus from the support of national leaders and of the press. The 
nation has grown steadily to recognize the proper balance to be 
observed between the claims of the schools of the capital and those 
of the rural districts. It has come to see that a healthy national 
life was possible only with organic changes in the schools of the 
outlying departments, and that these of Montevideo could without 
danger be left at their present status until the education of the 
people from whom the great city was steadily recruited should be 
attended to. It is in the light of this radical change in the national 
attitude that the educational history of Uruguay for the last bien- 
nium should be read. 
This epoch in educational progress has been further marked by 
the recognition of the need of financial support for rural education, 
and the further need of differentiating the subjects of instruction 
proper for rural children from those adapted to the city. In getting 
this principle clearly before the public mind, the educational au- 
thorities of Uruguay have played a part excelled in few countries 
for skill and devotion to the national interests. Mention should be 
made of the able contributions of Sefior A. J. Pérez, National 
Inspector of Primary Education, especially of his study entitled 
“ De la cultura necessaria en la democracia” (Anales, 1918). which 
applies to modern conditions De Tocqueville’s main lines of thought. 
A commission of nine experienced teachers, six men and three 
women, with Sefior Pérez as chairman, was appointed by executive 
decree to formulate the program of study for the projected rural 
schools. It began its sessions in February, 1917, and met frequently 
for two months. Its report was presented in May, 1917. Approved 
by the executive in June, by decree it went into effect on March 1, 
1918. The main contentions of the commission in support of its plan 
are well worthy of notice: 
1. Far-reaching changes within a generation in the commercial and 
industrial life of the nation have affected the rural districts and have 
called for different subjects and methods of instruction for the chil- 
dren of these districts. The rural school of the future must be  
-P-A-G-E-528
528 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  recognized as fundamentally an elementary industrial school ad- 
justed to local conditions. 
2. The successful rural school must have the following aims: To 
inculeate conscientious and efficient labor; to minister to a well- 
regulated and happy home life; to diffuse the knowledge of private 
and public hygiene, and to further the increase of population and 
public wealth and, in general, the possession of a well-founded and 
enduring popular liberty. 
3. The intimate relation of the rural schools with the problems of 
home life requires the new rural school to be taught by women, and 
therefore the training of young women as teachers in such schools 
should be at once initiated and continued as the basis of their success. 
Concrete illustration is found in the successful intensive training of 
24 young women in a course of six weeks at the normal institute at 
Montevideo in the summer of 1917. : 
4. In the administrative organization the committee was guided 
by the following general principles: (a) Not to install rural schools 
by foyndation or transfer except in localities where donations of 
ground of not less than 4 hectares (10 acres) should be immediately 
available; (b) to urge similar donations, public or private, to existing 
rural schools which lacked grounds of the minimum area above indi- 
cated; (¢) to propose and encourage the transfer of rural schools 
that had no grounds annexed nor could obtain such by donation to 
another parish where such advantages could be obtained without 
prejudice to the interests of the rural schools in the district. 
5. No child below 7 years of age should be admitted to the rural 
schools. 
6. The programs of study for the rural schools occupied the greater 
part of the commission’s time. The subjects of instruction as re- 
ported covered three years, and were reading, language work, writ- 
ing, arithmetic, drawing, agriculture, domestic economy, elements of 
applied geometry, geography and history (local, national, and uni- 
versal), singing, and gymnastics. In the view of the commission 
itself, the feature which peculiarly differentiates these new pro- 
grams is the complete application of practical methods and aims to 
each of these subjects, the elimination of abstract and memory teach- 
ing, and, above all, the development of the subjects of drawing, 
agriculture, and domestic economy. The fundamental aim through- 
out was to correlate instruction with the conditions and occupations 
of life in the several communities and to lead the pupil to see each 
subject as related to practical utility. 
Following the promulgation of the report of the commission, lively 
interest was manifested by the nation at large in the initiation of 
such rural schools. Practical difficulties, however, were foreseen in 
securing funds for their launching upon the nation-wide scale hoped
-P-A-G-E-529
  URUGUAY. 529 
for, and restlessness in certain quarters was manifested, though the 
Chamber of Deputies promptly voted the funds necessary. The 
National Rural Congress of Uruguay, in session in August, 1917, 
addressed to the minister of public instruction an urgent plea for 
carrying out the terms of the report in time for the opening of at 
Jeast a part of such schools with the new school year.

The medical inspection of schools has been favorably regarded in 
Uruguay for a number of years. It was initiated by law in 1913 with 
the examination of the pupils of the normal schools in Montevideo 
and the division of urban and rural schools into five groups. Since 
then popular approval of its application to the schools of the nation 
has steadily grown. 
Under the present law individual inspection of the physical con- 
dition of pupils concerns itself only with those who enter for the 
first time. Naturally the law is applied with varying degrees of 
rigor, the schools of the capital being visited regularly by the medi- 
cal inspectors, while those of the outlying departments are dependent 
upon the energy and faithfulness of the individual inspector. The 
Jaw assigns to each a certain number of schools to visit. Capable 
medical inspectors have served their nation well in pointing out the 
grave disadvantages from the use of primary schools for night 
schools for adults, especially the danger of tuberculosis. 
Medical inspectors are also required by law to include in their tri- 
monthly reports recommendations for repairs, alterations, etc., of 
school buildings and grounds called for by sanitary or hygenic con- 
siderations, 
Dental inspection has also been systematically carried on in most 
of the schools of the capital, the reports of oral and dental affections 
observed in the children reaching 76 per cent of the total ailments 
noted. Ocular inspection in the schools of Montevido has also been 
made a separate field within the last biennium. 
By an amendment of 1916 to the existing law an annual physical 
examination of teachers in the schools of Montevideo will be required. 
This was naturally, and in certain instances bitterly, opposed; but 
the opposition: has largely died down, and the teachers themselves 
have come to realize the benefits involved. 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
In accordance with the wish of educaticnal officials to diffuse among 
the schools of Uruguay the benefits of international progress in the 
physical betterment of school children, a commission was named by 
the executive in April, 1916, to draw up a plan of physical education 
171030°—21—Bull. 89 —34
-P-A-G-E-530
530 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
in schools. This commission, acting in cooperation with the general 
direction of primary instruction, recommended to the executive the 
appointment of a permanent technical commission of physical train- 
ing for schools, and this recommendation was approved by executive 
decree of March 8, 1918. The commission so appointed was to con- 
sist of a member of the general direction of primary instruction, 
one of the national commission of physical education, a physician 
of the medical school staff, a physician to be named by the National 
Council of Hygiene, the technical inspector of primary education, 
the technical director of the National Commission of Physical Edu- 
cation, the teachers of gymnastics of the normal institutes and of 
the primary schools of the capital, and two physicians who were 
specialists in diseases of children. 
The province of the commission was to draw up for the general 
direction of primary instruction programs of physical exercises for 
schools; to outline methods of instruction; to see.that these programs 
‘and methods were practically carried out in the public schools, to 
inform the school authorities upon points of deficiency in instruction 
and to indicate measures of correcting these; to organize gymnastic 
meetings and exhibitions for schools, and in general to promote the 
diffusion of physical education in the schools. 
In furtherance of the awakened national interest in physical edu- 
cation, the executive has appointed departmental commissions in 
various departments for the immediate provision of adequate play- 
grounds and the acquisition of apparatus for games to be installed 
in town and village plazas. These have cooperated with the National 
Commission for Physical Education, the latter having decreed the 
establishment, upon application of residents, of neighborhood and. 
community playing centers. All games, especially those of North 
America, which are adapted to the climate and environment have 
been systematically encouraged. In localities where it was required 
by law the executive has authorized the municipal authorities, with 
the consent of the national commission, to negotiate such loans as 
were necessary for the financial carrying out of this nation-wide 
scheme. These are steps of very great significance in a country of 
South America not by tradition or racial inheritance addicted to 
outdoor sports. 
SECONDARY EDUCATION. 
  By executive message of February 14, 1918, the work of certain 
of the departmental liceos in discovering boys of talent in the higher 
elementary schools who were without means of continuing their 
education, and giving them opportunities to pursue their studies by 
' means of a system of scholarships, was highly commended, especially
-P-A-G-E-531
  URUGUAY. 5381 
as a beginning of bridging the chasm between elementary and 
secondary education. ‘ 
In response to popular demand, courses in Italian and Portuguese 
were incorporated by decree of the secondary education division of 
public instruction in 1917. With the object of making known to 
teachers in secondary education the international progress in this 
field, a journal entitled “ Revista de Ensefianza Secundaria” was 
established by executive decree under the direction of the secretary 
of this division. All reports and public business concerning this 
division are to be published in this journal. 
By executive decree of November, 1917, all courses for the train- 
ing of primary-school teachers maintained since April, 1916, in the 
liceos of the outlying departments were discontinued. They had 
‘ been originally instituted by way of experiment for supplying 
teachers for the rural schools, and were not regarded as serving this 
purpose. Furthermore, in view of the agitation for improved rural 
schools, it was regarded as useless to continue a system of training 
which had proved, because of its environment, impracticable to 
harmonize with modern schools. 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION. 
The past biennium has seen a considerable development of interest 
in commercial education. By executive recommendation and by law 
of January, 1916, there were introduced in the liceos and national 
schools of commerce in the capital and three of the larger cities 
courses of varying length for the training of boys for the consular, 
diplomatic, and foreign agency services. By ministerial decree of 
April, 1917, there were incorporated in the national schools of com- 
merce courses in civil and commercial law, American history, and 
advanced courses in accounting and bookkeeping; and legal per- 
mission was given the individual school to extend the latter courses 
into the fifth year wherever deemed suitable. In common with 
students finishing the courses in the liceos, those from national school 
of commerce were granted opportunity to compete for scholarships 
abroad offered by decree of January, 1918. These scholarships are 
good for one or more years according to the success of the holder, 
and are apportioned among the departments according to the dis- 
cretion of the council of secondary and preparatory education. 
Among the usual scholastic requirements called for are periodical 
reports from the holder of such a scholarship concerning the social 
and economic conditions of the people among whom he has been sent 
to study. 
Following the plan drawn up at Montevideo in the summer of 
1918 by governmental and educational representatives from most of 
 
-P-A-G-E-532
  582 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
the South American countries, invitations were sent té all interested 
in commercial, education to attend the South American Congress 
of Commercial Education to be held in that city in January—Febru- 
ary, 1919. The best talent in this division of education was assigned 
the discussion of topics which were considered as most urgent at the 
present time. They were treated under two main heads, those of 
(a) economic commercial expansion and (b) commercial instruc- 
tion. The former head, not being essentially educational, calls for 
no notice here. The latter included the following topics: 
1. From what points, how, and by what means commercial educa- 
tion should be developed on the American continent; extent and sub- 
division of such instruction. 
2. Means of stimulating acquaintance among the peoples of the _ 
Americas. 
8. The centers of commercial education as professional schools, 
and as institutions of modern culture. 
4. Should courses in business ethics be included in the curriculum 
of the advanced classes? Morale, character, and culture of students 
of commerce and of consular service. 
5. Universal history of commerce as an indispensable element in 
the training of competent consuls. 
6. Are screen films necessary in giving instruction in commerce 
and geography ? 
7. Countinghouse practice. 
8. How should commerce be taught? 
9. Teaching of languages in the centers of commercial education. 
10. Preparation of women for a commercial career. 
Among the resolutions officially adopted by the congress which 
had educational bearing were those recommending that— 
(a) Institutes or sections of economic expansion in faculties of 
economic science, schools, and higher centers of economic and com- 
mercial study be established which should devote themselves espe- 
cially to the study and practical solution of the various economic 
questions affecting inter-American relations and solidarity. 
(6) For social and economic ends American countries create and 
aid industrial schools for fisheries and derived industries. 
(e) Propaganda primers be prepared for exchange among the 
public schools of the (South) American Continent. 
(d) There be included in programs of higher commercial study 
courses of comparative American economy and comparative cus- 
toms legislation (the latter for consular courses), and that existing 
seminaries of economic investigation or higher commerce schools 
write the economic and financial history of their respective 
countries.
-P-A-G-E-533
  URUGUAY. 533 
(e) The interchange of professors and students between the 
higher institutions of commercial learning be initiated. 
(f) International agreements be concluded for the reciprocal 
recognition of degrees issued by institutions of commercial learning 
and that scholarships be granted for the interchange of students. 
(g) The compilation of legislation of American countries con- 
cerning commercial education be intrusted to the permanent com- 
mission created by the congress. The commission will be assisted 
in this work by a committee of professors and experts in commer- 
cial education and will be charged with proposing plans and cur- 
ricula in accordance with the following: Commercial instruction, 
which presupposes primary education, to be divided into three cate- 
gories—(a) Elementary instruction, which may be dependent or 
independent; (0) secondary instruction; (¢) higher instruction. 
The purpose of these branches is: (a) To train auxiliaries of com- 
merce; (6) to prepare for commerce in general; (¢) to furnish 
economic, financial, and commercial knowledge preparing for di- 
rective functions in commerce and industry, insurance and consular 
work, etc. 
(2) Preliminary cultural studies of two grades be established, 
one confined to the first and second categories of commercial instruc- 
tion, and the second for broader instruction in the third category. 
(4) The study of the proposal of the National Institute of Com- 
merce of La Paz, Bolivia, concerning education of women be 
referred to the permanent commission. 
(&) Higher institutions of commercial education establish, if not 
already existing, in their curricula the separation of commercial 
from economic geography, the study of commercial geography to 
begin in primary schools, with periodical competitions for the 
preparation of the best commercial and economic geographies of 
each country and the exchange of prize works be arranged for. 
(Z) Institutions of bibliography and information be established, 
independent of or annexed to seminaries or institutes, for investiga- 
tion existing or to be founded in America, and providing for the 
widest exchange of economic, financial, and commercial informa- 
tion collected. 
(m) The practice of the professions receiving diplomas from 
higher institutions of commercial learning in commercial, civil, and 
administrative matters be legally recognized. 
(nm) An extraordinary prize to be known as the Pablo Fontaina 
Prize for Commercial Studies be offered for students of higher 
institutions of commercial learning. (Sr. Pablo Fontaina is director 
of the Superior School of Commerce of Montevideo and played a 
prominent part in the organization and work of the congress.)
-P-A-G-E-534

(0) Entrance into consular.and diplomatic services be granted by 
competitive examination or to candidates presenting degrees issued 
by official institutions of higher commercial learning. 
(p) Courses of ethics in preparatory studies and lectures on com- 
mercial ethics in higher institutions of commercial learning de- 
livered by distinguished professional men be established. 
TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 
  Uruguay has always been progressive in this field. In 1914 
Sefiorita Leonor Hourticou, the directress of the Normal Institute for 
Girls, submitted to the national inspector of primary instruction a 
far-reaching and systematic plan of reform in the aims and methods 
_ of practice teaching. She urged the establishment of a general direc- 
torate of teachers’ practice training, composed of directors of normal 
institutes and the national technical inspector of schools, which body 
was to operate through a salaried secretary. Practice teaching for 
the first grade was to be required for one year with a minimum of 
160 sessions and for the second year for at least three months with 
a minimum number of 60 sessions. ‘I'welve schools for practice teach- 
ing were to be established at Montevideo. Local inspectors were to 
be appointed by the general directorate. While this scheme was not 
enacted into law, yet it had very great value in focusing the attention 
of the educational authorities upon the practical problem of reor- 
ganizing practice teaching. 
These recommendations were allowed to lapse; but along with the 
demand for improved schools went a similar one for the improve- 
ment of the schools in towns and villages. In 1916 a committee of 
which the directress of the Normal Institute for Girls was chairman 
was appointed to formulate a training course for nonrural teachers 
which should be in keeping with the recognized needs of modern 
schools. In October, 1916, it presented as its report an outline of 
studies recommended to be incorporated in the three years’ training 
course for primary teachers. 
Taking up for the present only the teachers of the first and sec- 
ond grades, the committee recommended the following courses: 
Arithmetic, accounting, algebra, applied geometry, penmanship and 
drawing, elements of biology, zoology, botany, mineralogy and 
geology, anatomy, physiology and hygiene, physics and chemistry, 
studies in industries, geography and cosmography, history (national, 
South American, and universal), constitutional law, sociology and 
political economy, literature and composition, French, philosophy, 
and pedagogy with practice teaching. By the approval of the ex- 
ecutive these courses were to go into effect in September, 1917.

  Training of rural teachers—The movement to improve the con- 
ditions of rural life which has been mentioned before began in earnest 
in 1914. In that year a report based upon an intensive study of the 
social and economic needs of the rural districts was presented to the 
general direction of primary instruction by a committee of teach- 
ers especially appointed for that purpose. Though no official action 
was taken at the time, the ventilation of the subject was very oppor- 
tune and aroused public interest in a field so vital to the welfare of 
the nation. In every phase of rural education, and especially in the 
training of the teachers required, practical reforms were recognized 
as urgently necessary. From the strictly pedagogical point of view, 
the projects for teacher training as laid down in that report were of 
supreme interest, as constituting the basis upon which all subsequent 
suggestions have rested. They called for the establishment of a nor- 
mal school exclusively for women rural teachers, which was prefer- 
ably to be located either within the capital city or within easy access 
of it. This school was to work along the three main lines of agricul- 
ture, horticulture, and domestic science. For admission there was 
to be required, in addition to the usual certificates of mental, moral, 
and physical fitness, the certificate of completion of at least the third 
year of the program of the rural schools. 
The courses were to cover at least two years, preferably three, with 
provision for four-year courses for pupils aspiring to the post of 
rural inspectors, an aspiration which was encouraged in’the report. 
Only two or three scholarships were to be offered in each department, 
and the number of pupils was to be restricted to 50 for the first year. 
No purely theoretical instruction whatsoever was to be allowed. In- 
creasingly specialized work in the practice school annexed was to be 
required of every pupil each year. For the last two years the work 
of practice teaching was to be so arranged as to alternate by semes- 
ters with the classroom work assigned. The latter, toward the end 
of each semester, was to review all the work from the beginning. 
The projected institute was to be provided with all grounds, build- 
ings, and equipment necessary for the teaching of every phase of 
rural life, including the care of fowls and cattle, with library and 
laboratories, with a modern gymnasium, with a hall for the teaching 
of the fine arts, and, most important of all, with a mixed practice 
school under the direction of the authorities of the institute, consist- 
ing of at least three grades and preferably four. 
Summer courses for teachers, both men and women, were to be 
offered, emphasizing practical work in all courses related to rural 
life. Traveling schools of agriculture were outlined to appeal es- 
pecially to youths of years beyond the rural school age and already 
engaged in farming, each class to have not less than 8 pupils and not 
more than 15, and to continue for periods ranging from one week 
 
-P-A-G-E-536
  536 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  to two months according to the demand in each locality. These 
traveling schools were to be organized for the same unit of territory 
as the rural schools already in existence. Each course was to be 
arranged in cycles as follows: (1) Three years’ course in dairying; 
(2) four years’ course in domestic science; (3) three years’ course 
for rural teachers, men and women. [Suitable certificates were to be 
awarded students satisfactorily completing these courses. 
As regards the courses in rural schools, the committee found that 
the advantages accruing did not justify instructing pupils below 8 
years of age in formal agriculture, satisfactory progress being made 
if the pupil was awakened to a love of nature and an interest in the 
life of the farm. Pupils above 8 were to be instructed in agricultural 
courses progressively adapted to their maturity and to the peculiar 
conditions of locality, soil, and climate. 
As regards courses in domestic science, though the subject does 
not permit of a sharp age line of cleavage, yet the youngest girls 
might most profitably be given the elements, while the older girls 
might, in the discretion of trained teachers, take up the formal and 
technical study of food values in connection with elementary chemis- 
try, physiology, and biology. 
Anticipating the establishment of the normal schools for the 
exclusive training of teachers for the projected rural schools, the 
executive in November, 1917, sent to the Congress, along with the 
accompanying message, the project of a law for establishing two nor- 
mal schools of agriculture in the Departments of Colonia and San 
Jose. These schools were intended to minister to the special need of 
these outlying departments. Their courses were to be intensive in 
character, adapted especially to the training of teachers for these 
localities, and to cover a year. Indeed, the bill specifically mentioned 
their purposes as intimately related with the forthcoming rural 
schools. The bill at once became a law, and the schools were to begin 
operation in March, 1918. 
HIGHER EDUCATION, 
In the field of university education no changes, administrative or 
instructional, are recorded for the past biennium; but there has been 
a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the administrative govern- 
ment of the University of Montevideo. In September, 1918, the 
executive sent to the Congress, along with an accompanying mes- 
sage, the project of a law clearly defining the constitution of the 
directive councils of the several faculties of the University of 
Montevideo as established by the laws of 1908 and 1915. Conten- 
tion had arisen as to the right of electing representatives to each of 
these councils. By the new law each such council was to have 10
-P-A-G-E-537
  VENEZUELA. 5387 
members and a dean. In the faculty of law four of these were to 
be elected by the attorneys who were also professors; four attorneys 
to be selected by those neither professors nor substitutes; one minor 
attorney by those neither professors nor substitutes; one student 
delegate by the students themselves. 
In the faculty of medicine four members were to be elected by the 
professors, substitutes, and chiefs of clinics and laboratories; three 
members to be elected by the physicians not embraced in the above 
categories; one member to be elected by the pharmacists; and one 
by the dentists not included in the categories above; one member to 
be elected by the students of medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry. 
In the faculty of engineering four members were to be elected by 
the professors and substitutes; three members to be elected by the 
engineers; and two by the surveyors who were neither professors nor 
substitutes; one member to be elected by the students of engineering 
and surveying. 
In the faculty of architecture five members were to be elected by 
the professors and substitutes; four members to be elected by archi- 
tects who were neither professors nor substitutes; one member to be 
elected by the students of architecture. 
By decrees of 1917 enacted into law, seven years of advanced 
courses were required for the degree of doctor of medicine and five: 
years for the degree of architect. Special courses of one and two 
years in construction and materials, leading to certificates but not 
to degrees, were formulated and allowed by the ministry of public 
instruction. 
In pursuance of the policy of exchanging professors between the 
various countries of South America formulated at the Pan American 
Conference held at Buenos Aires in 1910, special exchange was 
arranged with Chile in 1916. 
EDUCATION IN VENEZUELA. 
Primary education in Venezuela, during the biennium under con- 
sideration, has enlisted the practical interest of the National Govern- 
ment as never before. This has taken shape primarily in the two 
fundamental administrative decrees of the Provisional President, Dr. 
Bustillos. The first, issued in February, 1917, outlines the general 
requirements laid down in the organic law of public instruction 
under certain regulations for primary public schools. These are 
divided into three main heads: (a) The primary elementary schools, 
in which only those subjects belonging to compulsory primary in- 
struction are taught; (b) higher primary schools, in which are taught 
the subjects belonging to higher primary instruction; (¢) complete:  
-P-A-G-E-538
538 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  primary schools, in which instruction is given in both the above divi- 
sions at once. 
The decree requires that each school be equipped with all modern 
appliances for the physical well-being of the pupils. Children are 
not admitted below 7 years of age; only those below 7 years are ad- 
mitted to the mothers’ schools or the kindergartens; only those above 
14 are admitted to the schools for adults. 
The subjects required in the elementary primary schools are: 
Reading, writing, and elements of Spanish; elements of arithmetic 
and the metric system; rudiments of geography and history of Vene- 
zuela; rudiments of ethics and civic instruction; rudiments of be- 
havior and hygiene; the national hymn and school songs; the first 
elements of manual arts, and, for girls, of sewing. 
In the higher primary schools are taught the following: Elements 
of Spanish grammar, elementary arithmetic, metric system, geog- 
raphy and history of Venezuela, elements of universal geography 
and history, elementary science, ethical and civic instruction, behavior 
and elementary hygiene, elements of drawing and music, manual 
arts and elements of agriculture and cattle raising for boys, sewing 
and domestic economy for girls, gymnastic exercises. 
Religious instruction is imparted to pupils whose parents or 
guardians require it, provided that the number of such be at least 10. 
The celebration of school festivals as required by law, the establish- 
ment of libraries in each school accessible to both pupils and teach- 
ers, and the keeping of books and registers by teachers and directors 
are among the general provisions emphasized in the regulations. 
The second decree, issued by the Provisional President in July, 
1917, sets forth the regulations for the official inspection of public 
instruction. It expressly concerns the following schools: 
1. Those maintained or aided by the Federal Union. 
2. Those of primary, secondary, and normal instruction, main- 
tained or aided by the States or by the municipalities. 
8. Public and private schools satisfying legal requirements of good 
conduct and school hygiene. 
The official inspection of schools has its ultimate authority 
vested in the following grades of functionaries: 
1. Committees (juntas) constituted by law in localities main- 
taining a school. 
2. Technical inspectors of primary, secondary, and normal in- 
struction for the Federal District and the States of the Union. 
3. A superintendent for the Federal District. 
4, Inspectors necessary for the operation of higher and special 
instruction. 
5. Commissioners appointed for special educational cases.
-P-A-G-E-539
  VENEZUELA. 5389 
The duties and responsibilities imposed by law upon the juntas 
of primary instruction are detailed at greatest length, as upon them 
rests the proper execution of the law and the success of the entire 
system. Most important of all these duties are those pertaining to 
the enforcement of compulsory primary instruction. The juntas 
are required to keep themselves informed of the primary instruction 
imparted to all children of school age in their district, whether in 
schools public or private or at home; to require all parents and 
guardians of children of school age to have such children instructed 
as required by law; to keep themselves informed of the progress of 
all such children; to impose fines as required by law upon all parents 
or guardians who neglect the instruction of children; to see that the 
children admitted to schools of all grades conform in age, state of 
health, etc., to the requirements of the law; to visit the schools in 
their district frequently and regularly; and to keep registers of all 
facts pertaining to the attendance upon such schools. 
The duties and responsibilities of the inspectoral juntas of sec- 
ondary instruction and those of normal instruction are full and ex- 
acting and along the lines already laid down. 
The technical inspectors as a group have charge of all three grades 
of instruction, each in the district assigned to him. As fixed by 
ministerial decree, there are 10 of these, excluding the superintend- 
ent for the Federal District. These functionaries are the direct 
agents of the ministry of public instruction, and form the connecting 
link between that office and the local juntas. They are vested with 
complete power to compel the execution of the law by the local 
juntas under penalties prescribed by law. They are instructed to 
work in complete harmony with the juntas, to call meetings, and 
to outline to them their duties under the law. They are also required 
to instruct teachers in their duties. In short, the inspectors are the 
element upon which the successful working of the machinery of the 
regulations depends. 
The superintendent of public instruction in the Federal District 
is directly under the authority of the minister of education. 
The inspectors of higher and special instruction have duties and 
responsibilities analogous to those of the inspectors already men- 
tioned, though these, for obvious reasons, are not outlined at such 
length. 
In the field of primary instruction the interest aroused in rural 
schools has been the most marked feature in the past biennium. The 
ministry of public instruction has paid special attention to the project 
of establishing rural schools, fixed or traveling, in the vicinity of 
the main manufacturing, industrial, or commercial centers of the 
country, and the President by decree of July, 1917, in commending
-P-A-G-E-540
  540 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
  the project, urged upon the juntas wherever possible to develop this 
type of schools. Especially in the agricultural or cattle-raising sec- 
tions was the project received with enthusiasm, applying, as it did, 
directly to the problems of illiteracy and the training of the country 
population in practical subjects related to daily life. By special 
decree the President urged the introduction of elementary courses in 
agriculture in the established schedule of studies. 
Among the States which definitely established such schools the 
State of Trujillo, fourth in population, took the lead by establishing 
14, with predominant emphasis upon practical courses in agriculture 
and related subjects. Such schools began at once to serve as centers 
for the instruction not only of the children of school age but of the 
population generally in new methods, the use of machines, cooperative 
societies, etc. Similarly in sections devoted to cattle raising they 
were centers of inspiration and instruction in related subjects. 
During the last biennium the industrial plants located in the cen- 
ters of Venezuela have established primary schools for the children 
of their operatives, with the approval of the authorities, State and 
municipal. The minister of public instruction, in his memoria for 
1918, urge upon the Congress the passage of a law recognizing the 
work of these schools, arranging for their inspection by the govern- 
mental technical inspectors and the classification and certification of 
pupils completing the courses offered in them. Such schools have 
also done much in combating the illiteracy among adults by means 
of night schools, and they have in many places, by employing excel- 
lent teachers, served the very useful purpose of raising the standard 
of requirement in various districts for the public schools, State or 
municipal. : 
Secondary education in Venezuela, according to the memoria 
referred to, suffers much from the insufficiency and irregularity of the 
revenues devoted to it, with the consequent inefficient equipment for 
modern and scientific subjects and the inadequate salaries of the 
teachers. On the pedagogical side the memoria found the effects 
experienced by secondary education from the mechanical and memory 
instruction, too largely prevalent in primary education, a permanent 
obstacle to any hope of real reform in secondary education. 
The colegios, a type of secondary school peculiar to the Spanish- 
American countries, of grade preparatory to the liceos, seem to be 
disappearing from Venezuelan education. There are now left only 
18 Federal colegios, all the others maintained by the States and 
municipalities having lapsed. The explanation probably lies in the 
exaggerated theoretical instruction they offered and its lack of 
adaptation to the actual needs of the nation. A number of them 
occupied buildings of some size and pretension, and the minister in
-P-A-G-E-541
VENEZUELA. 541 
his last memoria suggested that the vocational and industrial schools 
needed in the educational system might well be installed in these 
buildings. 
Interest in the education of girls has made progress in Venezuela, 
an especially promising liceo for girls having been established at 
Caracas, offering advanced courses covering two years, with special 
attention to physical training and modern subjects. 
Education in arts and crafts for men has long been popular in 
Venezuela, perhaps largely because of the national talent in those 
subjects. The school at Caracas, established in 1916, offers a four- 
year course, with English as the only foreign language. Within 
two years it reached an enrollment of 288 in the regular classes and 
218 in the night courses. 
Commercial education and training in political science courses 
have grown in popularity during the last biennium. Schools of the 
former have been established at Caracas, Maracaibo, Ciudad Bolivar, 
and Puerto Cabello; and of the latter, at Caracas, subsidized by the 
Government and regarded as an important “adjunct in training 
for the legal profession. 
In the field of the primary normal schools, the ministry has seen 
the necessity of their serving more largely the educational needs of 
the nation by supplying more and better teachers to the schools. It 
is, therefore, proposed to revise them thoroughly, especially in re- 
gard to the chief defect observed since their establishment, namely, 
the poor preparation of students who enter. It is proposed to offer, 
preparatory to the normal school proper, a perfecting course in essen- 
tials covering two or three years, to which would be added French, 
drawing, gymnastics, and music. Such a course would preferably 
be offered in the higher primary schools. The pupil should then pro- 
ceed to the specialized subjects of pedagogy, methodology, psychol- 
ogy, and the history of education, these subjects to cover one year. 
Another serious problem is the great difficulty experienced in secur- 
ing suitable candidates for the scholarships offered in the primary 
normal schools by the several ‘States and Territories. In many of 
them the memoria reports that the appointments had to lapse in 
view of the fact that no candidates qualified for them. The min- 
ister therefore suggested that a system of boarding departments, 
annexed to the normal schools, each accommodating about 20 boys 
of 10 to 13 years, should be established as feeders to the normal 
‘school system. 
By presidential decree, dated July, 1917, special courses in prac- 
tical agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, and domestic sciences 
were established in the primary normal schools, with the view of 
especially equipping teachers for the rural schools, whose establish- 
ment has come to be regarded as so necessary for the nation.

By presidential decree of March, 1917, an experimental station of 
agriculture and forestry, with an acclimatization garden, was estab- 
lished near Caracas. It is intended to serve as a model for other 
such stations in other parts of the country. “The objects of the sta- 
tion are the improvement of the methods of cultivation of the chief 
agricultural products of Venezuela; the introduction, selection, and 
distribution of seeds; experiments in reforestation; the suitability of 
soils to crops and of crops to various regions; and practical work 
for the training of agricultural foremen and forest rangers.”

GENERAL EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES? 
The chief educational undertakings during the year covered by 
the report were necessitated by the urgent economic conditions of 
the Japanese Empire, which were, as those of all other countries 
of the world, profoundly affected by the war. The immediate prob- 
lem, as avowed by the minister of education, was to cultivate in 
every line of governmental activity the powers of the Japanese people 
as directed toward the material development of national resources. 
Every opportunity, such as conferences of local school and secular 
authorities, of school directors, and lecture institutes, was system- 
atically utilized to emphasize essential points in national education, 
and in turn to obtain the mature opinions of all classes and individ- 
uals qualified to speak. A board appointed by the Department of 
Education investigated the educational and social conditions of the 
leading countries of the world, and reports of their findings were 
published at regular intervals, being sent to all local authorities, 
civil and educational, to the heads of all educationai institutions 
above the elementary grade, and to all persons connected in an 
administrative capacity with education. 
As was to be expected from the express avowal of educational pur- 
poses, the progress in technical education was most marked. Indeed, 
Japan’s unique educational fusion of traditional training in the 
national humanistic studies with that in modern science, precludes 
changes in any save the latter. Additional technical schools were 
established in a number of centers under the direct control of the 
department; and vigorous measures were taken to establish close 
and helpful relations between them and local industries and business 
interests. A cardinal purpose of these schools is to train competent 
teachers rapidly, and to distribute them in parts of the Empire where 
their need is felt to be most urgent. 
The activity of the several groups of educational workers did not 
slacken during the year covered. Conferences were held of directors

of higher schools, directors of special schools of medicine, directors 
of special technical schools, directors of higher normal schools for 
men and for women, and directors of middle schools. In accordance 
with the centralized Japanese system, certain questions deemed most, 
urgent of solution were selected in advance and submitted to each 
group for discussion; as a result, many helpful suggestions were 
forwarded to the minister for his consideration. Besides, the regular 
lecture institutes for teachers of elementary grade were held in the 
duly prescribed rotation of time and place, at which systematic in- 
struction was imparted in the subjects deemed most needed for the 
particular group. Especial stress was naturally laid upon the insti- 
tutes for teachers of industry, agriculture, and commerce. Both in 
subject and methods, war-time needs were had in view throughout. 
A far-reaching innovation was the initiation of a lecture institute 
for school inspectors designed “to impart general knowledge of the 
system of elementary education and of pedagogical administration to 
persons having direct supervision over local education, such as pre- 
fectural and district inspectors. Applicants are admitted upon the 
recommendation of the governmental officials of the respective locali- 
ties.” The subjects taught are of interest for their practical nature: 
National morality, pedagogics, educational administration, and the 
examination of elementary school books dealing with morality, the 
Japanese language and history, school hygiene, and practice in 
teaching art, science, manual arts, and gymnastics. 
A lecture institute on school hygiene was also initiated with the 
purpose of training intensively persons having charge of school sani- 
tation. Besides the strictly technical branches, such vital topics as 
hygienics, epidemiology, educational pathology, treatment of defec- 
tive children, theoretical gymnastics, and school sanitary administra- 
tion were emphasized. As going to show the unique solidarity of 
Japanese education and as a model of educational cooperation, it is 
of interest to note that the lectures for these institutes were drawn 
from all the higher institutions, such as the Imperial University of 
Tokyo, related higher technical schools, the higher normal schools, 
and the imperial colleges of medicine. 
In this connection may be mentioned the remarkable work, both 
in theory and in popular relief work actually done, of the institute 
for the study of infectious diseases. Though not essentially peda- 
gogical, the preeminent value of this institute to national education 
was recognized during the year covered in the report, and it was put 
definitely under the control of the minister of education, and formally 
annexed to the Imperial University of Tokyo. Examinations of 
pathological specimens submitted, investigation of locally prevalent 
diseases, treatment of patients, dissection of subjects, preparation of 
serums, and holding lecture institutes were parts of the manifold
-P-A-G-E-545

activities of this organization. Under the system of sending promis- 
ing students for study abroad, formally inaugurated in 1912, a total 
of 18 were sent during the year 1915-16 to the United States, 9 to 
England, and 1 each to China and Switzerland. Courses in applied 
sciences were almost exclusively their chosen fields. 
A movement to foster respect for elementary education is seen in 
the imperial regulations relating to letters of merit in elementary 
education, designed to honor meritorious persons connected with that 
branch. They are bestowed by the minister of education, on local 
evidence and the recommendation of a special committee, and are 
published in the Official Gazette. The recipients are elementary 
school teachers, the heads of municipalities, members of elementary 
school committees, and school physicians. During the year 1915-16 
this honor was received by 48 persons. 
The committee for the investigation of school books and charts is 
another manifestation of the efficiency which prevails in all depart- 
ments of Japanese education. Appointed by and under the super- 
vision of the minister of education, it works in three sections, the 
first examining and recasting books, charts, and manuscripts dealing 
with ethics, the second with history, and the third with the Japanese 
language. 
ELEMENTARY INSTRUCTION. 
Elementary schools are divided into ordinary elementary and 
higher elementary, the former obligatory upon cities, towns, or vil- 
lages, and extending over sid years; and the latter covering two years 
additional, or three years, as local boards may decree, and provide 
funds for maintenance. Supplementary courses in continuation 
subjects, or in the development of subjects already taught, may be 
established by the approval of the minister of education. A third 
type of elementary school is that in which, under the same roof, the 
ordinary and the higher elementary courses of one or more years are 
conjointly established. It is an interesting adaptation on oriental 
soil of the school consolidation movement, the progress of which has 
been so marked in the rural districts of certain States of the Union 
during the past few years. 
A significant feature is that as compared with the figures of the 
preceding year, the schools of the individual type decreased, the 
ordinary elementary schools by 224, the higher schools by 23. In 
those of composite character, the mixture of ordinary and higher 
elementary schools, there was an increase of 267, a step evidently 
recommended on the scores both of convenience of access and econ- 
omy of maintenance. In 1915-16 there were in attendance upon the 
ordinary elementary schools 5,840,268 boys and girls, a decrease of 
156,000 from the preceding year. This perhaps may be explained 
171030°—21—Bull. 89-35
-P-A-G-E-546
546 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
on the assumption that even in Japan the well-administered law of 
compulsory elementary school attendance had to yield in face of the 
heavy economic pressure upon the body of the people and the demand 
of the average family for the wages of the children. The total number 
of those who had completed. the ordinary elementary school course, 
and were in attendance upon the higher elementary course was 1,773,- 
099, showing a decrease of 24,000 from the preceding year, perhaps to 
be explained on the same assumption as above. Somewhat fewer than 
100,000 pupils were allowed. to postpone school attendance, and 
nearly 125,000 were exempted from obligatory school attendance. 
The average percentage, for both sexes, of attendance upon pre- 
scribed course of instruction makes an even better showing than for 
the preceding year, being 98.47 as compared with 98.26. 
Teachers in elementary schools.—In 1915-16, 99,292 men and 42,830 
women taught in the ordinary elementary schools of Japan, an in-, 
crease of nearly 2,000 men and slightly more than 1,000 women. In 
the higher elementary. schools 17,890 men and 2,980 women were 
teachers, the numbers being practically static. : . 
Salaries.—Eleven categories of teachers in elementary schools, ac- 
cording to the salary received, show salaries ranging from 5 yen+ 
(probationary) to 105 yen monthly, the three categories which re- 
ceive from 10 to 25 yen including more than two-thirds of the total. 
Pensions.—In accordance with the law relating to pensions for re- 
tired teachers and to the families of deceased teachers in elementary 
schools, 1,741,959,367 yen was apportioned for pensions, and 1,715,- 
007,397 yen was expended, a marked increase over the preceding year. 
In addition an educational fund was created in 1916 for the relief 
of public elementary teachers. Loans to municipal bodies, appro- 
priations for the encouragement of elementary schools, for needy 
children, for prizes and bonuses for regular attendance, for salaries 
of elementary teachers in remote districts, for the encouragement and 
investigation, of popular education, and for all purposes approved 
by the minister of education come within the purview of this most 
useful fund. A stock fund for additional salaries to teachers in 
elementary schools was created in 1900 by special law and by im- 
perial ordinance, such relief to be recommended by local authorities, 
and approved by the minister of education. Under these provisions 
about 70,000 teachers received slightly over 2,500,000 yen in addi- 
tion to regular salaries. 
MIDDLE SCHOOLS. 
Leaving the elementary school of both grades, the student is 
struck with the small numbers enrolled in the middle schools, both 
public and private, only 141,215, or 4 per cent of the number in the 
  
1 The yen is worth about 46 cents,
-P-A-G-E-547
    EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN JAPAN, 547 
elementary, being listed for 1915-16. No changes in courses or ad- 
ministration, and an increase of only 2,000 pupils in attendance are to 
be noted for this grade of instruction ; boys 12 years and over, gradu- 
ates of ordinary elementary schools are admitted, and the course 
extends over five years. The situation is significant of the essen- 
tially aristocratic character of Japanese education.. The clientéle of 
the middle schools is exclusively the official, military, and wealthy 
merchant classes, who desire for their sons the training necessary 
for these, and the university and other specialized careers. For 
their purposes the instruction and methods of the middle schools are 
admirably thorough and efficient. The courses‘are closely articu- 
lated with the advanced lines above mentioned, and the teachers 
are carefully selected for their training and competence. Interest- 
ing features are the steady increase during the past few years of the 
number of foreigners among them, there being 81 in 1915-16 out of 
a total of 6,448, and the subsequent careers of the graduates of regu- 
lar courses of the public middle schools. Business and the advanced 
special schools and special technical schools have attracted over 40 
per cent of the total of nearly 20,000. 
HIGH SCHOOLS FOR GIRLS. 
Corresponding to the middle schools for boys in aim and govern- 
mental establishment, but falling below them in curriculum, are the 
high schools for girls. Provisions for their establishment are identi- 
cal, both public and private, with those for the boys’ middle schools. 
A marked feature in this division of education was, for the year cov- 
ered, the expansion of domestic science courses, and the further pro- 
vision made for girls’ high schools offering only domestic courses, 
and denominated officially “ Domestic high schools for girls.” 
Those admitted to the course must be above the age of 12 and be graduates 
from ordinary elementary schools, or girls of equivalent attainments. The 
course of study extends over four years, when the graduates from ordinary ele- 
mentary schools are admitted; over three years when the applicants for admis- 
sion have completed the first-year course of higher elementary schools; over two 
or three years when they have completed the second-year course of higher ele- 
mentary schools ; and over two years when the domestic course is taken after the 
higher elementary school. Those who wish to study one or more subjects in the 
domestic course may be admitted as elective pupils. Supplementary courses 
of not more than two years may be provided in the regular high schools or 
in the domestic high schools for girls for the benefit of their graduates. A post- 
graduate course of two or three years may be provided only in regular high 
schools for the benefit of those graduates who wish to study some particular 
subjects as their specialty. 
Similarly to the two middle schools attached to the higher normals 
for men the Government maintains two high schools for girls at- 
tached to the Tokyo and the Nara Higher Normal School for Women. 
Together they enrolled, for the year covered, abort 900 students, a
-P-A-G-E-548
RR eae ee ee ie ai i 
548 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
slight increase over the preceding year. There were also 162 public 
high schools for girls, enrolling 58,009 students, and 125 public 
domestic high schools for girls, enrolling 17,370 students. Under 
private management there were 59 high schools for girls, enrolling 
16,889 students, and 18 domestic high schools for girls, enrolling 
2,747 students. A slight increase in all enrollments over that for 
the preceding yeaz is seen. 
HIGHER SCHOOLS. i 
A trend visible for the past four years in the higher schools is 
noteworthy. Higher schools, as the term is used in Japan, are sec- 
ondary institutions for boys in which preparatory courses are of- 
fered for entrance into the imperial universities. There are eight 
such schools, located in centers of population and industry. As 
originally contemplated in the ordinance relating to higher schools 
(1905), the higher schools were also to provide special courses in 
professional training, and they did so provide them until the de- 
velopment of these into independent institutions, which then ranked 
as special technical schools. With this, all such appended courses 
disappeared, during the year under consideration, from the cur- 
riculum of the higher schools. For admission to higher schools, 
graduation from middle schools, or the passing of test examinations 
prescribed, along with careful physical examination, is required. 
Following, therefore, exclusively the narrower field of preparation 
for the imperial universities, the work of the higher schools has 
come to be divided into three departments, devoted respectively to 
the preparation of students for the college of law or literature; for 
the college of pharmacy, engineering, science, or agriculture; and 
for the college of medicine. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In Japan the normal training of teachers is given in— 
(1) Normal schools aiming to train teachers for elementary 
schools, of which there must be at least one in each prefecture. They 
admit to the first section graduates of the higher elementary schools 
of three-year courses, graduates of their own preparatory course, 
and boys of 15 or girls of 14, at the discretion of the director; and to 
the second section graduates of middle schools or boys of 17 and girls 
of 16, at the discretion of the director. The courses in each section 
cover one year. 
2. (a) The two higher normal schools for men, which train teach- 
ers for normal schools, middle schools, and girls’ high schools. 
(0). The two higher schools for women, training teachers for girls’ 
normals, girls’ departments in normals, and high schools for girls. 
Both admit graduates of elementary normal schools and of public 
and private middle schools on competitive examinations. The  
-P-A-G-E-549
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN JAPAN. 549 
courses in both are identical, except for manual arts and domestic 
arts courses, and extend over three years. 
As in the case of the higher normal schools, an elementary school 
for practice teaching must be attached to each elementary normal 
school, and, in the case of normal schools admitting women, a kinder- 
garten also. Under special circumstances, and with the consent of 
the minister, local authorities may permit the substitution of already 
existent public or private elementary schools or kindergartens con- 
venient of access in place of the required observation and practice 
schools required by law. 
For rapid training of teachers for technical schools a number of 
institutes were founded in 1915-16 which were of the nature of 
schools attached to colleges of the imperial universities and higher 
technical schools, and designed to use the already existent advan- 
tages of buildings, laboratories, and observation schools for the 
teaching of younger pupils. Special ordinances of the Department 
of Education allowed exemption from fees and expenses on the stu- 
dents contracting to serve as teachers in technical schools. 
Japan’s system of teacher training is the result of a careful study 
of European institutions. She has borrowed whatever she judged 
best in the educational polity of each country. Her system is there- 
fore of an essentially composite order. Its original features, how- 
ever, constitute a valuable attempt to adopt diverse elements. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Mention has been made of the development of certain courses, 
originally incorporated in the curriculum of the higher schools, 
into special courses, and later into independent special schools. 
These are designed to give only advanced training in professional 
subjects; and only men and women are admitted who have completed 
the prescribed curriculum in middle schools, or in high schools for 
girls, with at least a four years’ course, and other men and women 
of maturity and approved attainments. In the case of special 
schools in which fine arts and music are taught admission is left to 
the decision of the minister of education. 
Under this important class of schools the Government maintains 
(a) five special schools of medicine at important points, enrolling 
2,375 students in 1915-16; (b) the Tokyo School of Foreign Lan- 
guages, enrolling 604 students, offering instruction in 12 languages 
and extending over three years or for a shorter course of two years. 
In response to a decided demand, a course in Portuguese was sub- 
stituted in place of Siamese. The enrollment of this school was 604 
pupils, an increase of 14 per cent over the preceding year; (c) the 
Tokyo Fine Arts School, enrolling 547 students, and the Tokyo 
Academy of Music, enrolling 598 students, an increase of 12 per 
cent over preceding year.
-P-A-G-E-550
550 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
In addition to these governmental schools, five public schools of 
medicine, pharmacy, and fine arts were maintained by communes; 
and 53 in literature and the sciences were maintained by private 
support. 
VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Vocational schools, for the distinctive training of boys intending 
to engage in productive labor such as manufactures, agriculture, and 
commerce, are of five kinds, technical, agricultural, commercial, nauti- 
cal, and continuation. Technical education is offered of primary 
grade, embracing practical subjects in crafts, arts, and sciences, and 
such subjects of study as ethics, Japanese mathematics, general science, 
and gymnastics. Elasticity is given these courses by the addition of 
other subjects demanded by local circumstances, and the dropping 
of still others, except ethics and those bearing directly on the branch 
studied. A subdivision of these is the apprentices’ schools, covering 
not less than six months nor more than four years. In the school 
proper the course is not more than three years. 
Great flexibility. also is allowed in the qualifications for admis- 
sion, these varying extensively in various localities. Technical edu- 
cation of secondary grade is of similar nature to the primary, but 
more formal, less flexible, and more inclusive of the sciences and 
the theoretical side of technical training. Schools of this grade may 
be attached to any middle school of two years’ duration, and special 
courses may be arranged for boys in business or at work. Only pu- 
pils may be admitted to this grade of schools who have attained the 
age of 14 years, graduated from a higher elementary school of two 
years’ course, or who possess equivalent attainments. Requirements 
for teachers in this grade of schools are also quite rigorous. In 
1915-16 the number of technical schools was 9,001, an increase of 
558 over the preceding year, and that of the private technical schools 
was 366, an increase of 20. Approximately 95,000 pupils were en- 
rolled in all schools of this kind, exclusive of continuation schools. 
TECHNICAL CONTINUATION SCHOOLS. 
These schools freely admit graduates of an ordinary elementary 
school, or boys of equal attainments, if not less than 14 years of 
age. In the judgment of the authorities, even this requirement may 
be waived, provided the applicant is under no further obligation 
to attend an ordinary elementary school. Ages and maturity of 
boys in attendance on these schools vary greatly, as do length of 
courses, school periods, season, and hours of the school sessions. 
All are left to the judgment of the individual school authorities. 
These very important schools in 1915-16 enrolled 407,600 male pu-   
1 Figures of enrollment were not available. 
 
-P-A-G-E-551
  
  EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN JAPAN. 551 
pils and 89,601 females, an increase of nearly 50,000 of both sexes 
over the preceding year. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
No change in the courses or administration of higher education 
is to be chronicled for the year 1915-16, the last for which re- 
ports are available. Among educational ordinances of the ministry 
of public instruction, external to the imperial universities, but 
closely affecting them, was that which placed private and munici- 
pal institutions of higher instruction which comply with standards 
laid down by the ministry on a par with the imperial universities, 
in that the graduates of the former will have equal advantages in 
competing for civil-service positions. This is regarded as a govern- 
mental step entailing far-reaching consequences in Government serv- 
ice. Details of its provisions are as yet unavailable. 
Considerable material and financial extensions are planned for 
the future. The Government intends to devote 44,000,000 yen ($21,- 
934,000) to extend the agencies of higher education, this sum to be 
a continuing expenditure extending over six years from 1919-20 to 
1924-25. Of this sum, 39,500,000 yen ($18,690,750) is to be ex- 
pended on the building and extension of schoolhouses and 4,500,000 
yen ($2,243,250) on the training of teachers. It is proposed that 
the greater part of the latter sum be appropriated to the costs of 
dispatching and maintaining students abroad. 
The proposal is to establish, in addition to the higher educational 
institutions already in existence, 10 high schools, 17 technical and 
commercial schools, 1 foreign-language school, and 1 school of phar- 
macy, besides extending the present colleges and organizing new 
ones. It is expected that the program will be completely carried 
into execution in .the course of six years, and that teaching at the 
new institutions will commence in 1925. 
As already reported, the Emperor has contributed the sum of 
10,000,000 yen ($4,985,000) toward the necessary funds, and the 
balance is to be met by public bonds or temporary loans. It may be 
added that in the educational year 1917-18 about 56,000 students 
applied for admission to public and private higher and special 
schools, while the capacity of these schools was only sufficient to ac- 
commodate 14,000.17 
JAPANESE EDUCATIONAL WORK IN FORMOSA? 
(A sketch of provincial educational administration.) 
The administration of the schools in the island of Formosa by 
the Japanese Department of Education has constituted throughout 
a remarkable record of progress in the face of serious obstacles.   
1 Japan Chronicle of Jan. 8, 1919. 
2This sketch is based upon the report compiled by the Department of Educational 
Affairs of the Government of Formosa, 1916.  
-P-A-G-E-552
  552 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
Formosa passed to Japan by cession from China in April, 1895. 
Very similar to the troubles encountered by the United States au- 
thorities upon their occupation of the Philippine Islands, racial 
and religious problems at once asserted themselves, taking shape in 
uprisings and forays on the part of rebellious natives: ‘After two 
months of military activities, the condition of the island was re- 
garded as sufficiently settled to allow the initiation of a system of 
education. The provisional office for the Department. of Education 
was accordingly opened in the city of Taihoku; and the active di- 
rector at once proceeded to establish schools in the most suitable 
localities, housed generally in the temple buildings, which were the 
only structures left intact. 
The question of language was at once to the fore. The native 
children of Chinese descent were, of course, averse to learning the 
language of the new rulers. The patience and skill, however, of 
the pioneer teachers were beginning to triumph and to show results, 
when the smouldering opposition again flared out in open violence. 
By preconcerted plot an attack was made upon all remote schools, 
and many teachers were killed. But the plans of the department 
were retarded only for a short time. By imperial ordinance the 
organization of the schools was put under military protection, new 
schools were built, and old ones restored and enlarged. These latter 
consisted entirely of the so-called language institutes, located in the 
larger towns, and grouped around iio? sable of the original native 
private schools, called the “reading and writing alls.” These lan- 
guage institutes now became the basis of the new system. Recognizing 
as the immediate task the teaching of the Japanese language to the 
native children, the department called for Japanese teachers as vol- 
unteers for the work in Formosa. This picked body of men and 
women received intensive instruction for three months in the native 
Formosan language, and was then distributed among the several 
schools. 
Following up the policy of preparing teachers, hese native, 
a normal-school department was annexed to the language school 
proper, and to it fell the task of supplying the needed teachers. 
With the pacification of the island, the growth of the elementary 
schools was so rapid that the Government could not wait for the 
first graduates of the newly-established normal schools, and seven 
distinct times the policy of training Japanese volunteers for the 
native schools was repeated. In the very maintenance of the latter, 
innumerable difficulties, inherent in the situation, had to be over- 
come. Chief among these were the fickleness of the native popula- 
tion, which, with the wearing off of the novelty of the schools, 
became wearied with the alien discipline enforced upon them; their 
superstitious and religious scruples; the dissemination of false
-P-A-G-E-553
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS IN JAPAN. 5538 
rumors as to the subjects taught and methods used; the deep-seated 
antipathy of the influential classes to Japan and all things Japa- 
nese, and their contempt for the Japanese teachers; the hostility on 
the part of the teachers and parents to the elimination of the tradi- 
tionally beloved “ reading and writing halls,” with their support from 
fees and their exclusive concentration upon the Chinese classics; 
the physical difficulties in the way of attendance even in districts 
reduced to order; and the terrorizing of even favorable parents by 
threats and the violence of predatory gangs. 
In the face of all these difficulties, however, steady progress was 
made. The military impress left upon the schools gradually dis- 
appeared, as the respect of the natives for schools and teachers grew. 
A most important phase of the change of attitude was the reconcilia- 
tion of the natives to Formosan youths taking work in the system. 
The work of these pioneer teachers covers, roughly, three years, 
closing in 1898, when the Japanese language institutes were formally 
organized into regular public schools. By successive logical steps, 
each of wider scope, the administration of educational affairs in 
Formosa came finally, in 1911, under the control of the educational 
department of the imperial civil Government, which is its present 
status. It operates in two sections, a highly centralized govern- 
mental section, and a locally representative body, composed of men 
of experience, vested with special powers in the matter of school 
support and finances. 
In content and method, practical educational work in Formosa 
has, for compelling reasons of race diversities, grouped itself under 
three headings, named in the order of their establishment by the 
Japanese authorities: (1) Work for the natives of Chinese descent; 
(2) work for the aborigines, and (8) work for Japanese children. 
Education of children of native Formosans of Chinese descent.— 
Elementary general or public education for the children of native 
Formosans of Chinese descent constitutes the keystone of the system, 
and has undergone many modifications and revisions before reach- 
ing its final state. Establishment of new schools had at first been 
made too easy, and had been accompanied by a corresponding laxity 
in providing for their maintenance. The permission of the Gover- 
nor General, instead of, as formerly, the local governor, effected a 
needed centralization, and stopped the duplication of local educa- 
tional plants. The age for attendance was extended to cover from 
7 to 20 years, instead of 16; but only 6 years, under special circum- 
stances shortened to 4, are required; and a latitude of 2 or even 3 
years is allowed beyond the age of 7 years for beginning school. 
The subjects taught in the six compulsory years are identical with 
those in the imperial schools. In the shortened four-year course 
science is omitted. Courses in agriculture, mechanics, and commerce 
are added wherever approved by the authorities. In all these public 
   
-P-A-G-E-554
ee one en Oe eave 
| 554 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
schools only practical ends are had in view. Their beneficial results 
are everywhere evident. The Japanese and Formosans are brought 
more closely together; the importance of the Japanese language is 
felt more and more keenly. Many public schools have been estab- 
lished at the request of the natives themselves. Another interesting 
formative result that has also manifested itself is the steadily in- 
creasing number of well-trained Japanese teachers attracted to the 
Formosan schools. 
Higher instruction for native boys is represented by a few middle 
schools of four years, admitting boys of 13 who have completed the 
fourth year of the public schools, by girls’ schools attached to the 
language schools, and by higher Japanese language departments at- 
tached to the language schools for boys and girls. The unique feature 
of this grade of instruction, induced by difference of conditions from 
those in Japan proper, is the training offered in them for teachers 
of public elementary schools. This is done by means of an annexed 
normal school of two divisions, the higher for prospective Japanese 
teachers, with special training in the native Formosan language, and 
the lower for native teachers. 
Industrial education for native Formosans is provided in the 
Industrial Training Institute, the industrial department of the 
language school.at Taihoku, and two experimental farm schools not 
under the Department of Education, but under the direct control 
of the Governor General. A further step is the provision of higher 
general education, combined with the industrial, in the Japanese 
language course of the language school at Taihoku, though, as yet, 
the demand for this by native Formosans is limited. 
An interesting survival from pre-Japanese days, as well as a sig- 
nificant proof of the wisdom of the Japanese authorities, is the exist- 
ence of the “ reading and writing halls.” These are private schools 
established and conducted by native teachers. They have weathered 
very adverse conditions; they were long regarded by the Japanese 
authorities as dangerous to Japanese rule; and they were often near 
extinction. But they always maintained an influence too strong to 
be ignored. Socially and ethnologically, they are the last and most 
typical representatives of the Formosan civilization. They are 
allowed individual independence and great latitude in courses and 
methods. Each is under the nominal control of the local civil author- 
ity, which generally pursues the good-natured policy of encouraging 
their adoption of modern subjects, especially the Japanese language 
and arithmetic, rather than forcibly compelling it, and seeks by. 
tactful methods to bring about a closer acquaintance and union with 
the public-school teachers and schools. The schoolhouse is generally 
the residence of the master, or some buildings connected with the 
local Chinese temple. the religious associations of the school of this

type constituting one of its strongest holds upon the natives. Chil- 
dren are generally admitted at 7 and continue until 14 or 15. The 
center of work is of course the Chinese classics, with no fixed course 
outlined; penmanship is stressed in connection with the literary 
work. Advanced pupils learn recitation, composition, and versifi- 
cation, all rigorously based upon the classics. 
Despite the wishes of the Japanese educational administration, 
these schools increased in the period 1912 to 1915 from 541 to 611, 
and their enrollment from 16,000 to 19,000, in round numbers, an en- 
rollment of almost exactly one-third of the total enrollment of native 
Formosans in the official public schools. This constitutes what is 
apparently the only problem that has baffled the Japanese educa- 
tional department in its career in Formosa. 
Elementary school for aborigines.—Even greater conservatism had 
to be encountered in dealing with the partly civilized aborigines than 
has been seen in the case of the natives of Chinese descent. With the 
sweeping reorganization of the primitive language institutes into the 
public school system, exception had frankly to be made for the 
aborigines. Their primitive language institutes were retained, and 
after many years and tentative modifications, developed into a pub- 
lic school system quite different from that in operation for the 
Chinese descendants. Only four years’ attendance is required; the 
subjects taught are only morals, Japanese, and arithmetic. Agricul- 
ture, manual training, and singing may be added, in the case of 
tribes intellectually more advanced. Supreme control is vested in 
the local civil authorities, who are allowed wide discretion in all 
matters concerning these schools. Children are admitted at 8 years 
of age. An encouraging growth in the popularity of these schools, 
and increase in numbers, has been evident. Native aboriginal youths 
have come forward as candidates for teachers; approximately 3,000 
pupils were enrolled in 1915 in 23 schools, an increase of over 500 
pupils since 1913. 
Education of Japanese children in Formosa—tThe education of 
Japanese children whose parents are residents of Formosa is con- 
ducted along substantially the same lines as prevail in imperial 
Japan proper. 
For administration purposes, and by imperial ordinance, the 
Governor General of the island corresponds to the imperial pre- 
fectural governor, and the local civil authority to those of towns and 
cities in Japan proper. Encouragement is offered to promising pupils 
to proceed to the imperial schools, and this is made easy by close 
articulation of subjects and courses. It is interesting to note also that 
an increasing number of native Formosan students go each year 
to complete their education in the schools of Imperial Japan. The 
Government is alive to the importance of encouraging this tendency,
-P-A-G-E-556
556 BIENNIAL SURVEY OF EDUCATION, 1916-1918, 
and in 1907 the office of student superintendent in Tokyo was created, 
with especial charge of the proficiency and conduct of all Formosan 
students resident in Japan. With this official, the authorities of all 
institutions enrolling Formosan students must closely cooperate. 
As has been indicated, the Japanese Government, soon after its oc- 
cupation of Formosa, recognized that the training of native teachers 
for the native schools was a matter of vital necessity if the natives 
were to be won over to acceptance of the public schools, and, through 
them, of the Japanese rule and Janguage. An index of the attitude 
of the natives in both these respects was constituted by the number 
of Formosan youth who came forward as teacher candidates. Prog- 
ress in this respect has been steady and gratifying, 619 graduates of 
such training having gone into school work in the 13 years of its 
existence. Several local institutions have been abolished. Normal 
instruction for natives is now organized solely in the B (or lower) 
division of the public-school course in the normal-school department 
of the Language School at Taihoku. Candidates from 14 to 23 years 
of age, with certificates of graduation from the six years’ public 
school, are admitted after examination upon elementary Japanese 
and arithmetic. The four years’ course covers ethics, pedagogy, 
Japanese language, Chinese classics, geography, mathematics, science, 
drawing, music, agriculture, and gymnastics. Manual training and 
commercial subjects are optional. All expenses are defrayed by the 
Japanese Government. “The aim of the educational work of this 
department is to make the graduates the embodiment of the ideal of 
the public-school education which is to bring about the diffusion of 
the Japanese language, the cultivation of the spirit of loyalty and 
obedience, and the encouragement of the habit of honest labor among 
the people.” “The source of general education in Formosa” is the 
significant name bestowed upon it. 
For teachers already actively engaged, teachers’ training extension 
work during the summers is systematically forwarded by the educa- 
tion authorities. Under the direct control of the Government, in- 
structors and lecturers travel the round of assigned circuits, a system 
which has advantageously supplanted the old one of gathering many 
pupils into one place. The other side of the work, that done by the 
local authorities, is probably more successful in reaching closely the 
mass of native teachers. All native and Japanese teachers of the dis- 
trict meet, and a point is made of inviting all teachers of the old- 
style “reading and writing halls.” Perhaps no other one influence 
is so potent in leading the way to some realization—however embry- 
onic at present—of the essential unity of Japanese education in 
Formosa.

PREFACE 
Tue purpose of this book is to outline a complete 
course of study in geography from the third through 
the eighth grade. The character and arrangement 
of the materials selected for each grade are discussed 
at length and the method of treating topics illustrated. 
The characteristic points to be noted are (1), the 
gradual movement from the home outward; (2), the 
strong concentration of study, first upon North 
America and second upon Europe ; and (3), the selec- 
tion of types as centres for the organization of 
materials. 
In laying out the course of study in Chapter XI, 
the points of correlation between geography and 
other studies are marked out, and the list of books at 
the close is designed as a direct help to teachers in 
realizing this course of study. 
This is one of a series of Special Methods, all 
aiming at the same general purpose. The others 
are as follows :— : 
1. The Special Method in Primary Reading and 
Oral Work with Stories. 
2. The Special Method in the Reading of Com. 
plete English Classics, from fourth to eighth grade.

3. The Special Method in History. 
4. The Special Method in Natural Science. 
These Special Methods are designed to work out 
in the particular detail of each study the principles 
discussed in the two volumes of General Method, 
based on the Principles of Herbart, and the Method 
of the Recitation. 
A course of study in two volumes is in preparation 
by the author in which the work outlined in the 
Special Methods and the courses in the remaining 
studies are combined into one comprehensive plan for 
the whole common school. 
In order to carry such a plan into full execution it 
is necessary to work out special books of material 
which furnish the full treatment of important topics 
in such studies as geography, history, andscience. A 
series of such supplementary books is in preparation, 
and is already partly worked out.

THESES 
Tue chief ideas discussed and illustrated in this 
book may be briefly stated as follows : — 
1. Geography is a study of the earth as the home 
of man. Each important subject treated should con- 
tain a central idea illustrating this point of contact 
between man and the physical world. 
2. Geography deals with man in his present 
physical, social, and industrial environment. It occu- 
pies the broad practical ground of everyday life as 
it is. 
3. Topics in pure science such as biology, physi- 
ography, meteorology, and in history are excluded 
from geography proper. Such topics, so far as they 
are germane to the common school work, belong to 
the course of study in natural science or history. 
4. The general movement in geography is from 
the home neighborhood outward to the home state, 
the United States, North America, Europe, Africa, 
Asia, Australia, and South America. 
5. The course of study should be so arranged 
that each succeeding year brings on a new set of 
important topics, not merely a rehash of old ones. 
x 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  x THESES 
6. The topics fully treated in the earlier grades 
(3, 4, and 5) should be simple and crude, like bulky 
material things, while the later subjects grow more 
refined and complicated. 
7. A few important topics for each grade should 
be carefully selected and elaborately treated. a 
8. These central topics in each grade should be 
well-chosen types which form the basis for com- 
parison, classification, and a constantly growing 
organization of geographical knowledge. 
9. There are four chief stages in this course in 
geography: (1) Home geography. (2) Studies on 
North America. (3) Studies on Europe. (4) The 
movement from Europe outward to the rest of the 
world. 
10. The skilful oral treatment of geography topics 
in intermediate grades is essential to good instruc- 
tion. ’ 
11. In the elaborate treatment of any type study, 
its causal and class relations to other things in geog- _ 
raphy, natural science, and history, in short, to its 
whole environment, should be carefully worked out. 
12. The constant review and elaboration of pre- 
vious lessons should be brought about by a detailed 
comparison of each new topic with similar topics 
studied in previous work. 
13. Many important geographical ideas require a 
continuous treatment and enlargement through the 
successive years of the school course. 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
THESES xt 
14. Such series of similar and connected topics, 
extending throughout the course of instruction, will 
gradually build up and organize the chief repre- 
sentative phases of geographical knowledge. 
15. Nearly all the facts of formal geography, such 
as position, direction, names and location of places, 
countries, etc., can best be learned incidentally, as 
essential details of large and interesting topics. 
16. Maps, pictures, diagrams, models, materials, 
products, excursions, and manual constructions should 
be freely used to give clearness and reality to geo- 
graphical studies. 
17. Children should be carefully trained in the use 
of text-books, maps, statistical tables, geographical 
readers, books of travel, and other books of reference.

SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
CHAPTER I 
THE AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 
WHILE it is admitted that geography is the study 
of the earth as related to man, it is not customary to 
hold strictly to this definition and to select for topics 
only those which emphasize this relationship. 
In fact the relationship to man may be wholly 
overlooked, and topics are often chosen and treated 
at first, without any direct reference to man, as 
forests, mountains, oceans, islands, the wild animals 
or plants of a region, etc. Of course these topics 
are found later to have a relation to man, but this 
relationship is not the central idea and basis of the 
treatment. Other topics, such as a canal, a lumber 
camp, a cattle ranch, a seaside resort, a coffee planta- 
tion, emphasize the relationship to man and make it 
fundamental. 
That geography is focussed upon the interactions 
between man and the earth is now affirmed by the 
best authorities. 
Professor W. M. Davis says: “It is especially the 
factor of relationship of earth and inhabitants that 
characterizes geography as a subject apart from other 
B £ 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  2 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
sciences, and that gives an essential unity of content 
and discipline to all its varied parts.” } 
Nicholas Murray Butler says: “The conception of 
geography that is here presented seems to me to be 
the only one which can support its claim to a large 
share of the time and thought of the elementary 
school; that is, the conception of it as a subject 
which relates the sciences of nature and of man. 
As a bridge over which to pass backward and forward 
from the study of man’s habitat to his activities and 
his limitations, and back again, geography is a unique 
and indispensable element of an elementary education. 
So treated it is excelled in suggestiveness by none of 
its companion studies.” ? 
The report of the Committee of Fifteen says: 
“After arithmetic, which treats of the abstract or 
general conditions of material existence, comes geog- 
raphy, with a practical study of man’s material habitat 
and its relations to him. It is not a simple science 
by itself, like botany or geology or astronomy, but a 
collection of sciences levied upon to describe the 
earth as the dwelling-place of man and to explain 
something of its more prominent features.” 
It is not necessary to multiply citations in favor of 
this accepted view of the scope of geography. 
The difficulty, however, lies not in securing a good 
and generally accepted definition of the meaning and 
1“ Progress of Geography in the Schools.” 
“The New Basis of Geography,” by Redway,
-P-A-G-E-15
AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 3 
scope of geography, but in working out a coherent 
and progressive course of study based on this idea. 
The point of view from which any topic is treated 
in geography is different from that of any one of the 
sciences in teaching the same facts. The outcome of 
man’s contact with nature is the centre of every 
strictly geographic topic. Geographers and book- 
makers are constantly falling away from this idea and 
dropping back into the separate sciences, — geology, 
physiography, meteorology, and biology. It is as if 
they were satisfied with a mere definition of geog- 
raphy, but in order to get some content worth discuss- 
ing they must drop back into one of the natural 
sciences. The main fortress of geography is left 
undefended while a number of surrounding ramparts 
thrown up by the separate sciences are well manned. 
In order to get the main contention clearly before 
us, we are willing to abide by the following somewhat 
drastic statement: Topics in pure science, such as 
meteorology, physiography, and in history, are ex- 
cluded as such from geography proper. Geogra- 
phy will use these same facts, but it will control them 
and focus them upon its own centres of thought. 
Such science topics, so far as they are germane to the 
common school work, belong to the course of study 
in natural science and history, not to geography. 
W. M. Davis says (“First Year Book”): “Geogra- 
phy has to-day entered well upon its third stage 
of progress. The ‘causal notion’ is generally ad-
-P-A-G-E-16
4 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
mitted to be essential in the study of the relation 
of the earth and its inhabitants. Thus understood, 
geography involves the knowledge of two great 
classes of facts: first, all those facts of inorganic 
environment which enter into relationship with the 
earth’s inhabitants; second, all those responses by 
which the inhabitants, from the lowest to the highest, 
have adjusted themselves to their environment. The 
first of these classes has long been studied as physical 
geography, although the name has long been used as 
a cover for many irrelevant topics. In recent years 
there has been a tendency to compress the name into 
the single word, ‘ physiography.’ 
“ The second of the two classes of facts has not yet 
reached the point of being named, but perhaps it may 
come to be called ontography. 
“Neither physiography nor ontography alone is 
geography proper, for it involves the relation in which 
the elements of its two components stand to each other. 
Each of the components must be well developed before 
geography can be taken up as a matute study.” 
This passage gives the right conception of geogra- 
phy, but at the same time shows how difficult it is to 
maintain the integrity of geography in the face of 
physiography and other sciences. 
If this were merely a matter of definitions and ver- 
bal distinctions, it could be ignored, but our geogra- 
phies are filled up to a considerable extent with topics 
in pure science taken from meteorology, geology,
-P-A-G-E-17
  AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 5 
physiography, and biology to the exclusion of a proper 
treatment of purely geographical topics. Even this 
would not be so serious if the science topics were 
appropriate to the children and suitable to their age 
and understanding. But many of the mathematical, 
geological, and physical topics in the geographies are 
known to be beyond the clear comprehension and 
interest of children. 
The Committee of Fifteen says : — 
“ The child commences with what is nearest to his 
interests, and proceeds gradually toward what is to 
be studied for its own sake. It is therefore a mistake 
to suppose that the first phase of geography pre- 
sented to the child should be the process of continent 
formation. He must begin with the natural differ- 
ences of climate and lands and waters and obstacles 
that separate peoples, and study the methods by 
which man strives to equalize or overcome these dif- 
ferences by industry and commerce, to unite all places 
and all people, and make it possible for each to share 
in the productions of all. The industrial and com- 
mercial idea is therefore the first central idea in the 
study of geography in the elementary schools. It 
leads directly to the natural elements of difference in 
climate, soil, and productions, and also to those in 
race, religion, political status, and occupations of the 
inhabitants, with a view to explain the grounds and 
reasons for this counter-process of civilization which 
struggles to overcome the differences. Next comes
-P-A-G-E-18
6 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
the deeper inquiry into the process of continent for- 
mation, the physical struggle between the process of 
upheaving or upbuilding of continents and that of their 
obliteration by air and water; the explanation of the 
mountains, valleys, the plains, the islands, volcanic 
action, the winds, the rain distribution. But the 
study of cities, their location, the purposes they serve 
as collecting, manufacturing, and distributing centres, 
leads most directly to the immediate purpose of geog- 
raphy in the elementary school. From this begin- 
ning, and holding to it as a permanent interest, the 
inquiry into causes and conditions proceeds concentri- 
cally to the sources of the raw materials, the methods 
of their production and the climatic, geologic, and 
other reasons that explain their location and growth.” 
The assumption is that the strictly geographical 
topics, dealing with man’s experience in contact with 
nature, are more tangible and interesting to children 
in the elementary school than the physiography of 
the earth. Believing this to be true, we set ourselves 
first of all to the task of selecting and arranging a 
more strictly geographical series of topics for the ele- 
mentary course of study, omitting largely the more 
distinctly scientific topics. 
On the other side, we may say that there is no more 
interesting and instructive study in primary and inter- 
mediate grades than nature study or elementary 
science. In our “ Special Method in Natural Science” 
we have discussed at length the value of nature study 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 7 
in-all the grades of the common schools. A full 
course of study in nature topics is there laid out, with 
illustrations. 
In the present chapter we wish to draw the line 
definitely between geography and nature study. In 
the two primary grades our course of nature study is 
given mainly to an observation of plants, animals, and 
the general physical environment of children. Many 
teachers and writers do not discriminate clearly be- 
tween nature study and geography in primary and 
intermediate grades. Without wishing to be over- 
critical or pedantic in this matter, we think it advis- 
able to have a distinctly marked geographical course 
from the beginning of the third grade on. The main 
reason for this is that geography from the beginning 
deals with a very interesting and valuable series of 
topics which the separate sciences do not attempt to 
treat. Geography has the double interest which at- 
taches to natural objects and human beings. It deals 
with people in the midst of their physical, social, indus- 
trial, and political surroundings. Geography studies 
should be intensely practical and social in their influ- 
ence, because in the industrial and commercial pur- 
suits men are producing and distributing those articles 
of mutual interchange and accommodation by which 
they get better acquainted and learn to depend upon 
one another. The political and economic topics of 
geography bring children as close as possible to the 
actual business and turmoil of the strenuous present.
-P-A-G-E-20
  8 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
It brings them equally in contact with mountains, 
rivers, mines, forests, deserts, cities, climates, and 
products of the diversified earth. One reason why 
physiography and the other physical sciences are 
not adapted to elementary instruction is that they 
inevitably deal with all these nature topics from the 
standpoint of systematic science, while geography is 
willing to take the crude materials as an immediate 
and necessary background for social units of study. 
Any one who will read carefully one of the first- 
class books of physical geography or physiography 
like that of Tarr or Davis, and will ask himself how 
much of this can be made available for elementary 
instruction, may find that he has but a meagre rem- 
nant of the whole. On the other hand, geography 
properly taught from the third grade on will contain 
a very large amount of crude physiographic material. 
Geography is the study of the earth as the home 
of man. This definition gives the key to geographical 
study, as distinguished from other studies and as re- 
lated to them. The study of the earth alone, its phe- 
nomena and forces, its vegetation and animals, its 
rocks and atmosphere, is natural science pure and 
simple. The study of man in his work and prog- 
ress, his struggles and representative deeds, is his- 
tory. The study of the earth as related to man 
is geography. Every topic in geography has a 
double footing in natural science and history. It 
has two faces,—one toward nature and one toward
-P-A-G-E-21
  
AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 9 
man. This double, or complex, character, is the 
distinguishing trait of a strictly geographical topic. 
The moment a topic becomes purely scientific or 
purely historical it loses its geographical character. 
Geography is the connecting bridge between two 
great real studies, nature and man. A description 
of the Illinois or Hudson river, for example, is the 
presentation of a great complex object in nature 
as related to the industries, travel, homes, and cities 
of men. The treatment of the city of Duluth as 
a natural trade centre includes not only the rail- 
roads and shipping that centre there (man’s work) 
but also the surface, climate, and natural resources 
of the Northwest, and the series of lakes and rivers 
which connect this productive region with the East- 
ern states and the Atlantic Ocean. The study of 
the White Mountains as a tourists’ resort would in- 
volve a multitude of nature’s works in rocks, gorges, 
and brooks, and man’s work in villages, roads, 
traditions, mountain-engineerjng, summit house, and 
other products of his brain and hand. 
I shall first inquire whether there are any impor- 
tant geographical topics which should be treated from 
a strictly geographical standpoint, and not from the 
standpoint of any other study, such as botany or his- 
tory. Many books and teachers do not discriminate 
closely between geographical topics and those which 
are strictly scientific (geological, zoological, astronomi- 
cal, etc.). A topic in geography proper is never strictly
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
identical with one in natural science, however they may 
overlap. In fact, it never centres in the same unit 
of thought. A geographical topic is, generally, a 
geographical unit, which involves incidentally a 
variety of facts from natural science and history. 
Pikes Peak and vicinity, as a resort, are a moun- 
tain neighborhood with a variety of scenic attrac- 
tions, all centring and culminating in the giant 
peak. A description of this mountain resort in- 
volves such topics as Manitou and its mineral 
springs as a health resort, Cheyenne Canyon, the 
Garden of the Gods, the Cave of the Winds, the 
foot-trail up the peak, the railroad to the top, the 
timber-line and rock-strewn summit, the views of 
the distant mountains and plains, the signal station, 
—in short, works of both nature and man’s inge- 
nuity. A great variety of scientific and historical 
facts is suggested by such a description as, for ex- 
ample, the explanation of the mineral springs, of 
air pressure at the base and summit, of granite 
boulders and their origin, of the formation of 
canyons, valleys, etc., by erosion, of vegetation at 
different levels, of the exploration of the peak, of 
the engineering difficulties of road-building. Any 
one of these topics, and several others, might sug- 
gest detailed scientific or historical treatment, but 
the geographical standpoint does not call for a 
detailed study of any of them. We may get a 
clear, definite, and interesting account of Pikes Peak
-P-A-G-E-23
  
AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY I1 
without a technical treatment of any of these topics. 
But Pikes Peak, as a typical mountain resort and 
centre, is important enough to call for a full descrip- 
tive geographical treatment. It will never receive 
this treatment in any one or in all of the natural sci- 
ences, or in history. The standpoint of each science 
is different, and the geographical unit is never reached. 
The geographical unit and its treatment would nat- 
urally come first in the order of the studies because 
it is a prominent, easily grasped whole. The ade- 
quate treatment of the suggested science topics, as 
wholes, will naturally fall to the separate sciences. 
The topics which can be treated from a strictly 
geographical standpoint are large complex units, each 
of which involves a variety of scientific and historical 
facts. Their unity is found not in any one of the sci- 
ences but in the geographical type which this object 
illustrates. The Hudson River, for example, the full 
treatment of which also involves a multitude of scien- 
tific, historical, commercial, and scenic constituents, 
is a geographical unit which typifies in its main 
points the character of many rivers. The descrip- 
tion of the important topics in this subject can be 
made very instructive and interesting without any 
effort to explain and work out in detail and sepa- 
rately the scientific problems which are suggested by 
the detailed treatment; for example the geologic | 
formations along its shores, Hudson’s first voyage up 
the river, the connection with Lake Ontario in the
-P-A-G-E-24
  12 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
glacial period, the effect of stripping away the for 
ests, the native plants and animals of the Adirondack 
region. These latter subjects may be very interesting 
for science or history lessons; they cannot be ade- 
quately treated in geography. The purpose of geog- 
raphy is not to ignore them but to suggest them, to 
use what is needed of them, and to show how inti- 
mate is the relation between them and geography. 
To further illustrate the distinctiveness and impor- 
tance of the geographical types take the treatment of 
the coal mine as a geographical topic. We have an 
extremely interesting and instructive description of 
the sinking of the shaft, of the ventilation of the 
mine, of the blasting out and hoisting of coal, the 
dangers from caving in and from explosions, of 
the transportation by river and railroad, and of the 
uses of coal in commerce, manufactures, and for heat- 
ing purposes. We may have such a geographical 
treatment of the coal mine as this, without any satis- 
factory discussion of the strictly scientific questions 
which are sure to be suggested by this study; for 
example, the origin of coal beds, the explosion of 
gases, the steam engine, the principle of the safety 
lamp, the oxygen in the air, the first discovery and 
use of coal, etc. We may well afford to treat these 
science topics in parallel lessons in natural science, 
but it would utterly swamp the geography lesson to 
branch out into anything like a scientific treatment 
of such topics. On the other hand, the coal mine is
-P-A-G-E-25
  
AIM AND GENERAL CHARACTER OF GEOGRAPHY 13 
a legitimate geographical topic which deserves to be 
handled in this study because it can never be so 
handled in any other school study. It has a central, 
controlling idea, which brings into relation and unity 
a large complex body of facts. It is the type of one 
of man’s occupations in subduing the world, and it is 
closely and vitally related to commerce, structure of 
the earth, and to human welfare generally. 
In order to secure and establish the independent 
right of geography in the sisterhood of studies, it is 
necessary to make out a series of important type 
subjects, in each one of which a characteristic central 
thought is so distinctly geographical that no other 
standpoint of natural science or history is able to dis- 
lodge the teacher from his geographical stronghold. 
Now this is exactly what is claimed for the leading 
series of type studies in geography. Each one of 
them centres in a geographical idea that is a natural 
stronghold. It is the focus for a variety of objects 
and facts which find in it as a centre their coherency 
and unity. The Rhine River is such a geographical 
unit. A California gold mine is another. The 
Andes Mountains, Minneapolis, and Lake Superior 
are others. If we can maintain the right of this 
series of geographical centres to a distinct place 
among studies, we shall be able to hold the geo- 
graphical field against all attacks, even against those 
who would obliterate the boundaries between geog: 
raphy and natural science.
-P-A-G-E-26
CHAPTER II 
SELECTION AND ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL 
GrocrapHy has more sides to it than any other 
school subject. As from a hilltop or fortress, it 
looks out in all directions upon the fields of knowl- 
edge. It draws interesting materials from many sci- 
ences, from history, mathematics, and the fine arts. 
In approaching the field of geography with chil- 
dren, we find ourselves face to face with such a 
variety and countless multitude of facts that we must 
at once resort to some principle of selection. Out of 
this miscellaneous mass of facts and phenomena we 
must select a few. Some facts are secondary or 
trivial; others are central and wide-reaching in their 
influence. Some facts are isolated and exceptional ; 
others are typical and illustrative of laws and 
principles. After deciding what the proper realm 
of geography is, it is our next duty to select those 
important subjects, a full understanding of which 
will be equivalent to a mastery of the strategic 
points in a widespread country. If we can take full 
possession of a line of these commanding fortresses, 
we shall be able to hold and subdue the whole 
country at our leisure. 
14
-P-A-G-E-27
SELECTION AND ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL 15 
In planning the course of study in geography, we 
have been guided in the selection and arrangement 
of the topics by the following ideas :— 
1. The general movement is from the home and 
home neighborhood outward, first to the home state, 
then to the surrounding states, to the United States 
and to North America as a whole, later to Europe 
and the rest of the world. 
This idea while important is not exclusive in 
determining the order of the topics. It gives empha- 
sis to home geography and to those familiar, con- 
crete, home experiences which should form the 
substratum of all geographical thinking. The typi- 
cal and illustrative character of home objects and 
occupations which makes them good interpreters of 
distant and foreign subjects has been overlooked. 
We are beginning to recognize that in all studies the 
home is the centre and rendezvous for all excursions 
into the field of knowledge: as it were the clearing- 
house for our whole commerce with the world. 
The objection that upon leaving the home neigh- 
borhood it makes no difference whether we pass into 
the next county or state or into Africa and Australia 
is not worth much. The child’s familiarity through 
conversation and hearsay with the next lying regions, 
cities, mountains, etc., is tenfold greater than his ac- 
quaintance with foreign countries. 
It is necessary, however, that children should early 
gain a somewhat clear notion of the world-whole, of  
-P-A-G-E-28
16 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
  the great earth as a globe, with its continental lands 
and wide-stretching oceans. This simple framework 
will enable him to locate and map out clearly his out- 
ward movement into the great world. In all geography 
study, the mind acts both analytically and syntheti- 
cally. Grasping the entire earth as a unit, it analyzes 
the whole into its parts, and, on the other hand, mov- 
ing outward from the home as a centre it builds 
constantly upon this basis. The time needed, how- 
ever, to get a clear and simple grasp of the world- 
whole is so small, while the work of gathering the 
rich and varied material in the outward movement 
from the home is so great, that the latter largely 
predominates. 
2. In this outward movement from the home there 
are four distinct stages: (a2) Home geography, with its 
excursions and varied study of local topography, occu- 
pations, and social life. (4) The leading topics of 
the United States and North America. This is a 
very interesting field of broad and varied studies, 
illustrating almost all phases of geographical knowl- 
edge. (c) The important phases of European geog- 
raphy. While Europe is relatively a small part of 
the world it has a greater number of valuable and 
instructive geographical topics than any other conti- 
nent, due to the varieties of its physical structure, the 
many distinctly different nationalities it exhibits, and 
the higher degree of excellence attained in the arts of 
life. (d) The movement from Europe outward into

the world-whole, — Asia, Africa, South America, Aus- 
tralia, and the larger physical and commercial aspects 
of the world-whole. 
These four stages, however, do not determine ex- 
clusively the order of the topics even in the synthetic 
movement from the home outward. We shall find 
that even in the study of home geography as well as in 
the treatment of important topics of the United States, 
many other parts of the world, as China, South Amer- 
ica and Australia, will be brought clearly into view. 
3. The most obvious reform in planning the course 
of study in geography is that of reducing the number 
of subjects treated in each grade to a few main topics, 
each of which has an important fundamental idea. 
Such a sifting out of the strong, representative topics 
most deserving of treatment will enable us to cast 
aside a burdensome load of unnecessary luggage. 
At the same time by limiting the study to a few 
important units, time is gained for those picturesque 
and descriptive details which are indispensable to 
lively interest and vigorous thought. 
Professor W. M. Davis says: “ The hopeful prog- 
ress that school geography has made in the last 
twenty years is characterized largely by a diminution 
in the number of isolated empirical items to be com- 
mitted to memory, and by a corresponding increase 
in the number of principles and generalizations to be 
intelligently studied. There is no reason for thinking 
that this progress has reached its limit ; there is, on the 
c
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
other hand, much ground for believing that, as the 
teachers and the teachers of teachers of geography 
gain a larger and broader understanding of the sub- 
ject in its mature development, the replacement of 
the lonesome empirical item by the rational category, 
under which the items are grouped in good fellowship, 
will continue to increase beyond its present moderate 
measure. Items must still be presented in abundance, 
young pupils need plenty of specific information ; but 
the items should be introduced in illustration of the 
categories to which they belong rather than as suf- 
ficient unto themselves.” 
4. The topics selected for the earlier grades should 
be simple, striking, and obvious in their character, not 
complex, intricate, and inscrutable. The city of New 
York as a centre of trade, manufacture, commerce, 
of political and social life, is too multiplex and in- 
volved for a child’s appreciation. It should be put 
as late as possible in the study of the United States. 
The more difficult problems of physiography, as of 
river-action, mountain-building, etc., the complexities 
of higher manufacturing processes cannot be ex- 
plained to younger children. For the intermediate 
grades the topics chosen should present crude, tan- 
gible geographical objects, — forests and lumbering, 
cattle-ranches, striking mountain peaks, the larger ag- 
ricultural productions, iron-mining and blast furnaces, 
famous scenery in mountains and along coasts and 
rivers, smaller trade centres where a few products
-P-A-G-E-31
  SELECTION AND ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL 1g 
predominate, and voyages and journeys among strik- 
ing and interesting scenes. 
Throughout the course of study there should be a 
careful movement from the simple to more complex 
topics. If it were simply a matter of learning the 
names and locations of geographical places, products, 
etc., we need not worry about this grading of topics; 
but since we are now trying to acquire gradually a 
mastery of geographical concepts, of underlying ideas 
and processes in man’s industrial contact with the 
earth forces and with his fellows, we must arrange in a 
graded series the units of study which lead up to an 
understanding of man in his complex environment. 
5. The course of study in history which runs 
parallel with that in geography is everywhere con- 
ditioned and controlled by geographical surroundings. 
Students and writers of history are giving more and 
more attention to this geographical basis. Not only is 
it necessary to make a pretty close study of a region in 
order to understand an historical topic but it may be 
well also to make a fuller study of the whole region 
from the geographical standpoint. Moreover, since 
the geography and history of America and Europe 
often deal with the same districts of country at about 
the same time in the school course, the history may 
well suggest a number of the best geography topics 
for each grade. History is itself based upon geogra- 
phy, and it also greatly increases the interest in 
geography.
-P-A-G-E-32
    20 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
6. In projecting the course of study in geography, 
we have almost wholly discarded the notion of the con- 
centric circles as a basis for arranging subjects. Each 
year brings on a new set of topics not previously stud- 
ied. We believe that there are other and much more 
efficient means of reviewing previous studies and of or- 
ganizing the new and the old into one compact body of 
knowledge than that offered by the concentric circles. 
7. The place which pure physiography occupies in 
this course of study is very limited, and may be dis- 
appointing to many. Nearly every topic, however, 
should receive rich contributions from physiographic 
knowledge, and the teacher needs to be well informed 
in this branch of science in order to bring its avail- 
able stores of fact and principle into close relation to 
geography topics. Some of the topics selected will 
have a strong physiographic aspect, but their bear- 
ings on man’s conditions and fortunes should be dis- 
cussed and clearly seen. 
It is clear from the above suggestions that we have 
found no single principle which is comprehensive 
enough to determine the selection of a course of 
study in geography. Being the most complex of all 
school studies, its curriculum is the result of a compo- 
sition of forces. The most general statement that we 
can arrive at is that geography deals with men in 
their whole physical and social environment. The 
whole man with the sum-total of influences brought 
to bear upon him is the subject of geography.
-P-A-G-E-33
CHAPTER III 
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 
Home geography in the third grade has to do with 
one’s native town and neighborhood, and with the 
varied objects of study they supply. 
The work will consist in the main of excursions and 
of later discussions of these in the class, — excursions 
into the home neighborhood to secure a close and 
accurate view of many objects and occupations, and 
discussions in class to bring out more fully their 
meaning and relations. 
There are seven principal topics that may be thus 
experimentally studied in home geography :— 
1. Food products and occupations connected with 
them. 
2. Building materials and related trades. 
3. Clothing materials used, manufacture, etc. 
4. Local commerce, roads, bridges, railroads. 
5. Local surface features. Streams, hills, woods, 
6. Town and county government. Court-house, 
city hall, council, etc. 
7. Climate and seasons. Sun, wind, storms, heat. 
2r
-P-A-G-E-34
  22 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
These seven topics cover a broad and varied field 
of home observation, and make up the physical 
environment which presses in from all sides through 
the senses. It may not be necessary to follow this 
outline in a fixed or unchanging order, but to con- 
sider the season, the neighborhood, the size of the 
class, and the local opportunities for excursions. 
Many topics studied in the two preceding grades 
have paved the way for home geography. Robin- 
son Crusoe has suggested many local interests. The 
science lessons have already led the children out 
upon short excursions. The fairy tales and myths 
have given vivid pictures of many home scenes. 
To those, therefore, who are interested in the 
problem of concentration of studies, the whole body 
of knowledge which we are now considering in third 
grade shows up not only a complex of closely related 
studies but also a close adaptation to the interest and 
needs of children of this age. 
We will enter upon a brief discussion of each of 
the seven topics previously mentioned. 
1. Food products—The spring season is a fitting 
time to make a few excursions to the gardens and, 
perhaps still farther, to the farms. The gardeners are 
busy with hotbeds, seeds, young plants, and the fresh- 
turned soil. At this season, also, many of the children 
may observe the work of ploughing, transplanting, 
and cultivating in their own gardens, and report 
upon the same. In the fall, also, before and after
-P-A-G-E-35
HOME GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 23 
the first frosts, they may again turn a closer attention 
to the products of the gardens, orchards, and fields. 
In the springtime it may be well to select one or two 
characteristic vegetables for a full description of the 
planting and cultivation, as the cabbage seed, hot- 
bed, transplanting, hoeing, storing, or covering-in for 
winter. In the same way one or two of the fruits 
may be examined and discussed, as blackberries 
and grapes. 
A catalogue should be made of the vegetables 
produced within a radius of several miles, as toma- 
toes, cabbages, turnips, onions, potatoes, tobacco, etc. 
Without going far from home, but keeping within 
the children’s range of observation, we may form 
a long and varied list, and find instructive lessons, 
which will serve good purposes in future studies. 
With town children it is often necessary to take 
systematic lessons of this kind, else they will be 
ignorant of elementary ideas in agriculture, com- 
merce, and surface. 
The list of food products about our home may be 
increased by a list of the fruits, cultivated and wild, 
found in our gardens, orchards, woods, and fields. 
We need to get definite knowledge of plants which 
yield berries and other small fruit, as well as kinds 
of apple trees, crabs, plums, cherries, haws, etc. 
Besides the vegetables and fruits, what grains are 
raised on the farms near us? Take a grain like wheat 
and describe the succession of steps in preparing the
-P-A-G-E-36
    24 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
ground, drilling, harvesting, threshing, milling, etc, 
till it is ready for final use. 
The farmer’s stock is an important part of his out: 
fit, as horses, cattle, sheep, or swine. The relations 
of grain-raising to stock-raising, and the profits of the 
farmer in combining the two, are of interest. A de- 
scription of the farmer’s work in winter, spring, sum- 
mer, and fall may give some notion of the variety of 
his occupations. The tools, machines, barns, and sheds 
necessary to the farmer are noticed. It is worth while 
to observe when and how the farmer gets his grain 
and stock to market. The need of wagons, roads, 
bridges, and markets is made apparent. 
2. The second main topic, bulding materials, calls 
for an investigation of the things used in building 
our houses, — pine and hard wood, the varieties of 
stone used, brick, sand, lime, iron, glass, tin, lead, 
slate, paper, and paint. Besides observing the va- 
riety of uses to which these things are put, and the 
quality of the materials, it is well for us to visit a 
sawmill, a carpenter shop, a stone quarry, a brick- 
yard, a planing-mill, a stone-cutter’s, a tinner’s, a 
plumber’s, and a lime-kiln. It is especially desirable 
to observe the work upon a house in process of con- 
struction. A connected description of each of these 
places should be given by the children after obser- 
vation. It is systematic school work. A few ex- 
cursions to these places are necessary, children and 
teacher together. We observe, also, and describe
-P-A-G-E-37
  
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 25 
the tools and machines used by the men in their 
different occupations or trades. 
3. The third topic, clothing, will have to do with 
wool and leather, and any other raw materials, as 
furs, that are produced in our neighborhood; also, 
the home animals that yield leather, wool, and fur, 
also the tanneries, shoe-shops, woollen-mills, and 
any other local industry bearing on this subject. 
An explanation of the process of weaving by which 
the fleeces of wool are converted into woollen cloth 
or blankets is quite practicable at this point. The 
same as to fanning. Secondly, we would discuss 
cotton, silk, linen, straw, and rubber goods which 
are brought from a distance but are familiar in 
daily use. Our purpose, however, is not to discuss 
these topics exhaustively at this point. 
Besides the occupations already mentioned, nearly 
every city or town has some special Jocal industries 
worthy of mention, such as wagon-works, paper-mills, 
a shoe-factory, glass-works, machine-shops, foundery, 
basket-factory, etc. It is well, also, to call to mind 
the great variety of occupations in any town besides 
those already named, as grocers, bankers, dry-goods 
merchants, doctors, engineers, wholesale dealers, black- 
smiths, watchmakers, tailors, etc. 
4. Our fourth topic, voads, bridges, and local com- 
merce, stands in close relation to the previously dis: 
cussed occupations. The chief wagon roads by which 
the farmers, gardeners, dairymen, quarrymen, and
-P-A-G-E-38
    26 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
wood-cutters bring their produce to market, are not 
only remembered and described by the children, but 
these, with a few of the main streets of the town, 
form the nucleus for a map of the neighborhood. 
Farmers and others bring their loads into town for 
sale, and with the profits thus gained buy and carry 
back with them such things as they must have from 
the city. In this way the idea of a town as a trade 
centre for receiving the raw products of the surround- 
ing country, and in turn distributing groceries, cloth- 
ing, tools, and many other things to the farmers, is 
made clear. The chief railroad lines to the neigh- 
boring villages or towns should find a place on our 
map as it is gradually outlined. These furnish ideas 
of commerce on a larger scale, and between villages 
and a larger town. If our town lies on a navigable 
river or canal, a knowledge of the boats and their 
cargoes is of importance. 
5. The fifth topic that requires a detailed treatment 
is local surface features. Some may prefer to put this 
subject earlier in home geography, and to this there 
is no objection if the season of the year is favorable. 
If any stream flows near the home, all the leading 
facts connected with such a watercourse should be 
observed and described, for example, the current it- 
self with its shallows, rapids, and deeper places; 
the sand-bars, bottom-lands, and bluffs, sloping and 
tree-covered or steep and rocky; the old channels 
and lagoons; the river as seen at different seasons,
-P-A-G-E-39
  
  HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 27 
floods, high and low water, uses of the river in winter 
and summer, the river commerce, if it is navigable; 
the whole river valley with its irregular course as 
seen from some commanding point. Then there are 
the smaller streams and valleys opening into the 
larger. Up these valleys, roads are laid out into 
the uplands. In some places the bottom-lands are 
rich and productive, in others sandy or flooded. 
Erosion, or the wearing force of water, can be 
clearly seen. Then there may be wooded slopes, 
brooks, and springs, rocky cliffs, and picturesque 
outlooks, the regular layer of rocks, and the caves 
in the sandstones. Even along smaller streams 
many of the characteristic objects of a watercourse 
may be discussed. There are many other surface 
features which we may observe best near home. The 
idea of the forest and of the prairie may be dis- 
tinctly formed, meadow and cultivated field, hill 
and mountain, valley and plain, ridge and water- 
shed, island and lake, waterfall and mill stream, 
difference in soil and consequent differences in 
products. If we understood how much all future 
geography study depends upon this use of home 
materials, we certainly would not neglect them. 
6. The sixth topic is Lome government. The town 
hall, the court-house, and the officers there em- 
ployed, furnish the best starting-point. What 
duties have these people to perform,—the mayor, 
the town council, the county judge, and county treas- 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
  28 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
urer? What does the town council meet to discuss 
and decide? (waterworks, streets, police, improve- 
ments, taxes, etc.). It is not the abstract but the con- 
crete treatment of these subjects that children need. 
Beginning with the objects and persons we see, we 
are to interest them in these things still further. 
7. Still a seventh topic of home geography is 
found in the observation of sun, moon, and stars, 
and seasons, the varying length of day and night, 
and the changing position of sun and moon. We 
forget that these grand object lessons, some of them 
the most beautiful and imposing, belong directly to 
the child’s home and are a part of it. Such are a 
few of the more noticeable constellations, the clouds 
and storms, cold, heat, rain, and their effects, the 
sunsets. These ideas lie at the basis of mathematical 
geography and climate, just as some of the other 
topics contain the concrete elements of Sone 
surface, and government. 
A brief survey of the topics thus far suggested in 
outline will show that the children by personal in- 
spection and experience have become acquainted 
with the common staple necessities and leading occu- 
pations of men, as farming, mining, manufacturing, 
trade, and with many lesser ones; that the idea of 
commerce and a trade centre has become clear. Defi- 
nite ideas also have been formed as to a river, brook, 
hill, forest, prairie, field, lowland, valley, island, slope, 
watershed, etc. Clear notions of town and county
-P-A-G-E-41
  
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 29 
government have been reached, while climate, the 
seasons, and the phenomena of the weather, have not 
only been seen, but closely observed. There is 
scarcely a topic in subsequent geographical study 
which does not find a sure, concrete footing in this 
preliminary work. If there is any value in careful, 
personal observation or in the principle of going 
from the known to the unknown, it is fully illustrated 
in the successive grades of geography study. The 
home constitutes the first great unit in this branch of 
work. 
EXCURSIONS 
It is difficult to see how a successful study of the 
home neighborhood can be carried on without excur- 
sions. A single excursion will often supply abundant 
materials for instructive discussion for two or three 
lessons. Any attempt to discuss the same topics, 
without the basis of real observation, which the trip 
supplies, will soon grow formal and unattractive. 
There is much variety of surprising knowledge to be 
gained by stepping from the schoolroom directly 
into this great world of realities. The ignorance of 
most so-called intelligent people of many important 
things about home is matter for surprise. It is an 
extremely faulty training that allows us to pass by so ~ 
many of these things without any desire or effort to 
understand them. 
When we come to study the climate, surface, indus- 
tries, products, and commerce of distant states and of
-P-A-G-E-42
    30 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
foreign countries, our ability to understand and 
construct correct pictures is based upon the va- 
ried ideas of similar kind that we have gathered 
in vivid and real form from our home neighbor- 
hood. The imagination must be our chief helper 
in constructing geographical pictures after leaving 
home. But the imagination cannot construct pic- 
tures out of nothing any more than a builder can 
construct a house out of air. The imagination works 
with the materials of experience already gathered. 
It is not expected that we should gather all the 
experimental facts we may need in third-grade 
excursions. We can do but little more than open 
the door into life and its varied forms, but we can 
make a useful beginning. 
Excursions with groups of school children need to 
be well planned. The teacher must know pretty 
clearly what are the chief objectstobeseen. Itshould 
be as definitely planned as a lesson. If possible, the 
place would better be visited beforehand by the teacher. 
During the excursion it is often desirable to get the 
children together and direct their attention to certain 
objects or processes, then take them aside for question 
and inquiry. 
After returning to school (the next day, perhaps), 
the observations gathered upon the excursion should 
be related in class, explanations made, faulty notions 
corrected, and many ideas brought out more distinctly. 
Such a discussion may be as helpful as the excursion
-P-A-G-E-43
  HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 31 
itself. Many ideas connected with the business or 
place may be brought home to their minds, which 
were not seen or noticed at the time, but which may 
be very important for the understanding of the whole 
subject. If a factory is visited, the kinds of ma- 
terials used and where obtained may be investigated. 
Drawing the objects, machines, or processes seen 
is an excellent means of making more vivid their 
observations. In visiting shops, factories, buildings, 
and even in nature, many objects will be more 
clearly formed in mind if the practice of drawing 
is frequently resorted to—not esthetic drawing, 
but mere sketching, diagramming, and picturing ob- 
jects in a crude way. It may be well, also, in the 
drawing lesson proper, to take some of these ob- 
jects for more accurate reproduction. But we had 
in mind not the drawing lesson proper, but the 
sketching for help in understanding and remem- 
bering facts and objects. 
There are many serious difficulties in the way of a 
general introduction of excursions :— 
1. It has not been the custom to make such excur- 
sions for purposes of instruction. It is generally 
supposed that children will pick up this kind of in- 
formation without aid from teachers. 
2. It is difficult to manage large classes out of 
doors. It is hard enough to keep children busy 
with good work in school. Get them outdoors, and 
the burden is doubled. Children are more difficult 
   
-P-A-G-E-44
    32 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
to manage in the open air than in a schoolroom. 
They take liberties, etc. It is a real burden, often- 
times, to go upon an excursion with a large class of 
children. Over against this difficulty there is one 
considerable advantage. A teacher who wishes to 
know and understand her children can oftentimes 
do it much better outdoors or upon a journey than 
in a schoolroom. They are more free to express 
themselves. Moreover, when the right spirit pre- 
vails, children and teacher come closer together and 
arrive at a better understanding and sympathy with 
each other when abroad. Even if a teacher can’t get 
away with children more than once a term, it will be 
a new experience that will add much to the interest 
of school life. 
3. There are dangers connected with visiting fac- 
tories and workshops. Great precaution in this 
respect is necessary. A single unfortunate accident 
would outbalance a great amount of good. A teacher 
should be very watchful to prevent any accidents. 
In mills and shops, where machinery is used, it is 
better not to take more than a dozen or fifteen chil- 
dren at a time, and to look out for their safety. Even 
in excursions, where no danger is present, a teacher 
should be watchful and careful not to overexcite or 
overstrain the children. In climbing the stairs to get 
to the cupola of a large school, one little girl became 
timid and nervous, and was taken back to the lower 
rooms at her request.

1. Preparation. — Notice was given to the children 
that on the following day a trip would be made to 
the planing-mill, and they should get permission of 
their parents before going. 
At 2:15 p.m. the next day, seventeen children out 
of a class of nineteen set out under the direction of 
the teacher. Taking a street-car, they soon came 
within a block of the planing-mill. 
Before entering the mill the children were fully 
cautioned against touching the machinery or get- 
ting too close to wheels or bands. The teacher 
then inquired at the office of the mill to secure per- 
mission to go through the shop. The teacher then 
D
-P-A-G-E-46
  34 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
glanced into the mill to see where to begin the in. 
spection of machines. It is necessary to keep the 
children together, to call their attention to the 
special points. 
a. The first process observed was the planing of 
rough boards at the planing-machine. The effect 
could be seen as the board came through smooth and 
bright on one side. But the process could not be 
seen, as the knives were covered up by the large pipe 
that carried away the chips or shavings. 
6. A band-saw was next examined as it stood 
motionless. The children, at first, failed to notice 
how the saw circles about the two wheels. The 
workman then applied the power, and sawed out a 
number of brackets. 
c. A scroll-saw was also observed, both at rest and 
in motion. The up and down movement was seen, 
and several pieces of scrollwork turned out. 
d@. Several circular or buzz saws were examined in 
action as they sliced up inch and two inch boards. 
They were also used in sawing up pieces of board of 
specified length. 
e. A turning-lathe was closely observed as the 
workman chiselled off a post for a porch. The skill 
and beauty of this work were surprising. 
Jf. Three machines were also seen in motion as 
they mortised and turned out door-panels. 
Several other machines were not in operation, and 
therefore were not more closely studied.
-P-A-G-E-47
    HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 35 
g. We all passed into the engine room to observe 
the belt which transfers the power from the engine 
to the main shaft that runs the whole length of the 
mill. After seeing this source of power we passed 
again into the main room to notice again how the 
wheels ranged along the main shaft are supplied 
with belts which carry the power to the different 
machines. 
A. Passing out of the planing-mill, we stopped for 
a brief review of the chief machines and operations 
observed. We also took a survey of the lumber- 
yard, the great chimney, and the storehouse where 
the doors, sash, and other fine materials manufac- 
tured in the mill are stored. 
In passing along the street we came to a long, two- 
story, brick livery-stable in the process of construc- 
tion. It was very wide, with a heavy framework 
of wooden timbers as interior support. This build- 
ing gave an excellent chance to observe two 
things. First, two rows of heavy posts, a foot in 
diameter, supporting two heavy beams extending 
through the length of the building. Upon these 
beams rested the foot-wide joists, whose other ends 
were built into the brick walls at the side. A better 
opportunity to see clearly the interior frame of a 
large building could hardly be found. Secondly, 
a single horse was being used, with a wheel and 
pulley, to lift loads of brick and mortar to the 
builders who were at work upon the second story.
-P-A-G-E-48
36 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
The upper and lower wheel could be distinctly seen, 
also the movement of the rope and load. This is not 
only a good typical illustration of the rope and pulley, 
but also of the idea of horse-power, which is so often 
referred to. 
When one is out upon excursions with children it 
is well to take advantage of such incidental object 
lessons as are thus offered. We might travel many 
miles without again meeting such an opportunity as 
was thus thrown in our way. 
In the next geography lesson in the schoolroom 
the main objects which were seen upon this excursion 
were thoroughly discussed. It will be found that 
many things which were supposed to be clear to the 
boys and girls were not so. Many things, also, which 
were not clear,can be made so to the children. 
Sketches and diagrams were made both by teacher 
and pupils. 
The whole time occupied by the excursion, from 
the time of taking the street-car till we got off at 
home, was two hours and twenty minutes. If it had 
been desirable, the time could have been shortened to 
one hour and forty minutes. 
The pine boards and different kinds of wood used 
in the planing-mill were noticed, and attention called 
to the railroads which bring these materials from a 
distance. The relation of the planing-mill to the 
work of contractors and carpenters in house-building 
was discussed in the class.

4. View to the north. Sore 
In the cupola of the Normal School building, we 
are lifted above the tops of the highest trees in the 
campus, and can look abroad over a wide area of what. 
was once a prairie country. Looking first to the 
west, we see a characteristic farming country of the 
prairie region. There are groves of trees about 
the farm-houses, and fields of different kinds, as corn, 
oats, and pasture. To the northwest lies a prairie 
with but few trees, rolling and stretching away for 
many miles. We can trace the main road westward, 
and as the eye follows it to the western horizon we see 
a line of black. It is the woods about eight miles 
west of Normal. This natural forest stretches from 
the south along the western horizon for many miles. 
Passing to the opposite side of the cupola, we look 
down upon the scattered village of Normal, in sum- 
mer time so embowered in trees that few houses can 
be clearly seen. The whole town has become a 
grove of maples and elms, but when the leaves are 
fallen we can see the chief streets, the two railroads, 
and the station at the junction, the stores, the big 
barns and windmills, and to the northeast a mile 
away the Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home. Beyond the
-P-A-G-E-50
  
38 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
town to the east, the road climbs some long hills as 
it rises to the higher prairie country beyond. To 
the east in this direction can be seen the nursery and 
the stock-yards. 
Turning to the south, we have a city before us. 
Two miles away we can see ten or a dozen church 
spires, the court-house, the Wesleyan, the smoking 
chimneys of the big car-shops along the Chicago & 
Alton Railroad, the stove foundery to the southeast 
on the line of the Illinois Central. The tall water- 
tower of the Bloomington waterworks is the highest 
object in the whole landscape. The line of the 
Chicago & Alton, and also of the Illinois Central, can 
be distinctly traced, as well as the street-car line 
between Normal and Bloomington. 
The culverts can also be seen where the little 
stream that drains the town of Normal passes under 
the railroad. 
Turning our eyes out the north window, we again 
have a prairie country, sloping upward. There is a 
steady slope for three miles or more from the north 
southward to Sugar Creek. Beyond the creek toward 
Bloomington the road rises somewhat abruptly, leaving 
a perceptible valley between Normal and Bloomington. 
It is necessary to discuss these matters closely 
with the children, so as to give their observations 
clearness and accuracy. 
When we consider the variety of typical objects 
seen in such a view of the country as this, it proves
-P-A-G-E-51
  
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 39 
its utility. Prairie, forest, cultivated fields, railroads, 
factories and shops, country roads, bridges, and the 
churches and buildings of a city furnish important 
elementary pictures. A second lesson in class should 
give the children a chance for a full description and 
discussion of these objects. 
With this survey of the surrounding country as a 
basis, the teacher and children should draw a map of 
the region observed, laying out the campus as a 
centre, the chief wagon roads and railroads, and 
locating upon it the leading points of interest already 
discussed. This should be worked out on a fixed 
scale, taking some familiar half-mile or mile stretch 
as a standard of measurement.

In the spring or fall some dwelling is usually in

-P-A-G-E-52
40 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
make perhaps three excursions of half or three-quar- 
ters of an hour each to such a house in process of 
building. 
When the foundation is just complete or, better 
still, while the masons are at work upon it, notice 
the depth and extent of the cellar, the materials and 
tools used, windows, and door-frames. On the re- 
turn from the first excursion describe the materials 
and work seen. Draw also the ground plan of the 
basement, using the foot or yard as a standard of 
measurement. 
The second trip may be made when the framework 
is toward completion, so that the posts, joists, beams, 
studding, and rafters may be seen, and how they are 
mortised or nailed together and rested upon the 
brick foundation. Notice the joists of the second 
story; also the rafters of the roof and how fastened 
at the ridge and sides. The manner of setting in 
door-frames and window-casings may be seen. 
A third trip may be made to observe the lathing, 
plastering, and interior finish. The slaking of the 
lime and mixing with hair are also instructive in the 
preparations for plastering. Later we may observe 
the finer work of interior finish, painting, graining, 
decorating, papering, etc. 
The material and tools used in all the processes of 
building should be seen and understood. The prep- 
aration of materials at the carpenter shop, planing- 
mill, and tin-shop should be noticed. The different
-P-A-G-E-53

trades involved in building, as of masons, carpenters, 
tinners, plumbers, painters, contractors, and millmen 
should be appreciated, each in its specialty. 
Each excursion, of course, will be worked over in 
the schoolroom, with such descriptions and drawings 
as are needed to bring out clearly the facts observed.

HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 44 
More than half of the above-named excursions 
have been made with classes by the author, for schoo) 
purposes. This list may be considerably enlarged. 
In almost any village neighborhood it would not be 
difficult to find twenty places adapted to instructive 
excursions. But even if but a half-dozen such trips 
can be made during the year, they will prove valu- 
able in several ways. 
Some of the excursions in home geography treat 
topics which lead out in an interesting way to the 
larger world beyond the home. 
In visiting a house in process of building or a 
lumber-yard we naturally inquire where the lumber 
comes from. In New York State, children should be 
shown on a map how lumber is brought down from 
Canada and Lake Champlain to Albany and distrib- 
uted southwards. A map of the United States or 
of North America is needed to give the full answer 
to this question. In visiting a fruit store the children 
see apples, oranges, and bananas. When this is 
discussed in class, a map of the United States and 
North America is needed to locate the apple-produc- 
ing states, New York, Michigan and Missouri, to see 
where oranges are raised in Florida and California, 
and to trace back the bananas and pineapples to 
Jamaica and the West Indies. In the same way we 
have occasion to locate the oyster-beds in the Chesa- 
peake and Long Island Sound, the sugar-cane fields 
in Louisiana, the hard-coal fields in Pennsylvania, the
-P-A-G-E-56
  44 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
beef-producing regions on the Western plains and 
cattle-ranches, the Georgia pine for our houses, in the 
Southern states, the peanut lands in Arkansas, the 
salmon in the Columbia River, salt in Central New 
York, etc. 
Even a globe and a map of the world will be needed 
in the third grade to locate Japan and China as tea and 
silk producing lands, Brazil as the land of coffee, the 
Mediterranean countries for olive-oil and dates, Ger- 
many for beer and sugar, Italy for macaroni, hand-or- 
gans and fruit-venders, France for wine and silk, etc. 
This study of foreign lands in early grades need 
not be forced prematurely upon children, but as occa- 
sion rises in these home excursions it will be interest- 
ing for them to locate the countries from which various 
products come. Of course, the children will not at 
first understand the globes and maps. Distances, di- 
rections from the home, and the meaning of lines and 
colors on the map will call for careful explanation. 
Throughout the lessons in home geography in the 
third and fourth grades, there will be many opportuni- 
ties for making these brief excursions into the great 
world beyond, arousing curiosity and paving the way 
for later studies. 
In the fourth-grade geography there are three 
additional avenues of approach to the large world 
beyond the home neighborhood. 
1. A few leading topics of the home state, such as 
the Hudson River, Erie Canal, Adirondack Moun.
-P-A-G-E-57
    
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 45 
tains, dairying and fruit-raising in New York require 
a study of the map of the whole state and to some 
extent of those adjacent to it. 
2. A few simple descriptive topics of a picturesque 
and outstanding character touching up some of the 
more pronounced features of North America: for ex- 
ample, a description of striking scenes along the Atlan- 
tic coast from Newfoundland to Florida, including the 
fisheries, the rocky coast of Maine, the summer resorts 
and sea-bathing, the oyster-beds, the waterways of 
the Carolinas and Florida, the winter resorts of the 
South, the lighthouses and life-saving stations, the 
great harbors and fortresses for shore defence. 
Another topic would be a summer among the lakes 
and mountains of New England, or a trip down the 
Mississippi from Itasca to the Delta, or life among 
the cattle-ranches of the Western plains and foot-hills, 
or a winter in Florida, or travels among interesting 
scenes and famous resorts of the Rocky Mountains. 
Reénforced by good pictures and descriptions, a few 
large, easily comprehensible topics of this sort might 
serve as a hopeful introduction to the geography of 
North America. 
3. Several large geographical units are suggested 
by the pioneer histories which are handled in 
fourth grade: for example, the more striking points 
in the physical character of the St. Lawrence River 
and of the Great Lakes including their value to the 
Indians and early explorers; the dangers and toils of  
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
a sailing voyage across the Atlantic in the days of 
Hudson and John Smith; the great forests of the 
Atlantic states in the early days of settlement, cloth- 
ing plains, and mountain sides; the fisheries on the 
Banks and their influence upon early voyages and 
trade; the bays, rivers, and mountains of Virginia in 
connection with Smith’s adventures; the difficulties 
of crossing the Alleghany Mountains in early days, 
including the river valleys, water-gaps and water- 
sheds. 
In addition to the above variety of geographical 
topics in fourth grade, several of the stories of Euro- 
pean history and the narratives of early explorers 
from England, France, and Holland will direct atten- 
tion to the geography of Europe and its chief coun- 
tries. All the history stories both in America and 
Europe should be clearly grasped in their geo- 
graphical environment, with such study of maps and 
blackboard sketches as will leave clear and strong 
impressions. While the geographical and historical 
studies should be kept clearly distinct from each 
other, so that each has its own well-defined series of 
topics, the close and necessary relations between the 
two should be emphasized in each study. 
THE EARTH AS A WHOLE 
Besides the seven topics of the home environment, 
there should be, in the oral work of third grade, a 
discussion of ¢he world as a whole.
-P-A-G-E-59
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 47 
Different-sized globes may be used to bring out 
the idea of the earth as a sphere. The continents 
and oceans may be located, the hot regions of the 
equator and the cold, polar regions described, without 
entering into mathematical geography. North Amer- 
ica should be examined a little more in detail, and 
our own home state located in its proper relation to 
the whole country. It seems to us better to leave 
out of third grade the explicit discussion of the 
earth’s motions, the causes of the seasons, latitude 
and longitude, and the general forms of contour and 
surface given even in our elementary geographies. 
The purpose of this study of the earth as a whole 
is to get a bird’s-eye view of the earth and of our own 
position and relation to it, so that we are prepared to 
move out from the home with a clear knowledge of 
our bearings and a simple understanding of the whole 
earth upon which we live.! It seems clear that only 
a few lessons need be given to this study of the earth 
as a whole, and that by far the greater part of the 
time in third and fourth grades may be put upon the 
study of home objects. 
There are several reasons why children’s early 
horizon of geographical study should not be lim- 
ited to the immediate home neighborhood. Even 
1 A few lively oral drills with the whole class in naming and locating 
the continents, oceans, chief countries, and regions of the world will 
quickly fix the essential points in mind. Left alone with their books 
at this early age, children dawdle, squander time, and form bad habits 
of study.
-P-A-G-E-60
  
  48 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
before entering school, they have heard of the earth 
as a big ball. The Robinson Crusoe story in second 
grade carries them across oceans and into new regions. 
The “Seven Little Sisters,” read in third grade, is an 
effort, in story form, to realize some of the characteris- 
tic features of the whole big earth. Many of the 
myths, traditions, and Bible stories lead children to 
distant portions of the earth. Finally geographical 
study in every grade must be both analytic and 
synthetic. It must begin at home and work outward 
gradually, and it must also grasp the earth as a whole 
and begin to analyze into parts. In our fourth-grade 
plan we shall attempt to show that the fundamental 
movement should be from the home outward; but it 
will be necessary, at intervals throughout our prog- 
ress, to take broad surveys of the earth as a whole, 
of continents, oceans, and large areas. Such broad 
surveys are necessary to keep our bearings and to 
prevent a blind movement into unknown regions. 
The study of primitive life seems appropriate to 
children in the third grade. It deals with the simple 
modes of life and industry among early peoples, or 
among races which remain in the primitive state of 
culture. These stories of primitive life are large 
object lessons in which the scenery of simple-minded 
men in contact with nature is brought out. 
In our own continent we have several illustrations of 
this crude life of the early races, in the Indians of the 
plain, in the Zuni villages of the Southwest, and in the
-P-A-G-E-61
HOME-GEOGRAPHY EXCURSIONS 49 
Eskimo homes of the North. A description of their 
houses, domestic utensils, food and modes of prepar- 
ing it, clothing and how made, hunting, fishing, agri- 
culture, and family life, their use of domesticated and 
wild animals, fruits, plants, —all these are simple 
and typical of fundamental arts. 
The reproduction of these arts in pictures, models, 
and material constructions, the use of the mortar and 
pestle, the simple loom for cloth-making, the prepar- 
ing of foods, the making of houses or tents, of weapons 
and common tools, furnish the children with appro- 
priate and interesting manual activities. 
The primitive life of Europe and Asia has been 
made also the basis of such studies among children, 
as that of the patriarchal times, of the Persians, 
Egyptians, and Greeks. The primitive arts and in- 
dustries of these early races have been employed as 
an introduction to history and industry. 
A sort of alphabet of this early life is given in 
“Seven Little Sisters.’ This book can be used to 
good advantage in the third grade (winter term) to 
introduce children to some of the chief countries of 
the world, to the people who inhabit them, and 
to those beginnings of racial life in the family and 
to common occupations which form the basis of 
society.

  CHAPTER IV 
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES — TYPE 
STUDIES OF NORTH AMERICA — ILLUSTRATIONS 
Tue lessons of the fifth and sixth grades are mainly 
devoted to a study of the United States and North 
America. In addition to this the historical stories 
relating to Europe call for the explanation of a 
number of large and important geographical topics, 
while mathematical geography in the latter part of 
the sixth grade brings into prominence some of those 
more difficult problems of the earth’s motions, the 
changing seasons, latitude and longitude, which need 
to be clearly mastered. 
The importance of the full study of the United 
States and of North America as a whole at this stage 
of the course needs to be clearly demonstrated. It is 
the second of the four great stages in geographical 
study. 
1. The first reason that may be assigned for this 
emphasis of the United States is that it is the one 
country above all that we need to thoroughly under- 
stand. We shall have more dealings with it in all 
sorts of ways than with all the other countries com- 
50
-P-A-G-E-63
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 51 
bined, and these dealings have to do with the essen: 
tial labors and pleasures of life. An understanding 
of the physical and social conditions that surround us 
in America is fundamental to any intelligent and 
practical appreciation of our duties and opportunities 
as citizens of the world. 
2. Again the United States is not a small and 
secluded corner of the world, where only a few 
things come to light. We are almost in the centre 
of the highways of the world, and there is displayed 
about us a great profusion of the most instructive 
and delectable geographical topics. Our wide-spread- 
ing plains and forests, our canals and rivers, moun- 
tains and lakes, our varieties of climate, coast-line 
and products, our cities, and teeming industrial life, 
furnish an almost bewildering variety of great geo- 
graphic object lessons. 
3. The topics already treated in connection with 
home geography are especially adapted to introduce 
the children to the larger subjects of American geog- 
raphy. The conversations of the home, the incidental 
mention of cities, rivers, mountains, and states not 
far distant have partly lifted the veil from the great 
world abroad and have aroused the active curiosity of 
thechildren. Before the children of New England 
proceed toa full and definite study of topics on Europe, 
Africa, and South America they should have their 
curiosity satisfied in regard to the Maine woods and 
lakes, Boston and its famous buildings and harbor, the 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  52 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
Hoosac Tunnel, the oyster-beds of Long Island, the 
granite quarries and maple-sugar camps of Vermont, 
the big mills at Lowell and Fall River, the White 
Mountains, and Lake Memphremagog. This involves 
a natural pedagogic movement, and hardly needs a 
further argument. 
4. We wish to understand the chief physical objects 
and industrial processes as springing out of the condi- 
tions and environment of American life. This must 
be based upon a continuous journey from the home 
outward, building as much as possible upon experience. 
We are undertaking the serious problem of under- 
standing industrial and social life as influenced by 
physical surroundings. If we were merely learning 
the names of cities, rivers, mountains, etc., we might 
as well begin with England or South America. But 
we are chiefly concerned to probe beneath the surface 
and get at the meaning of a few of the more impor- 
tant geographical names. This makes us, therefore, 
much more cautious in our selection of topics at the 
moment of leaping from the home into the big world 
beyond. By a full and accurate description of a few 
large American topics, closely related in important 
ways to home topics previously worked out, we hope to 
bridge over this gap between the home and the lands 
just across the border. Let us not be in haste to get 
into Africa or Australia if we can only plant our feet 
firmly in American soil. In the end we shall the 
better understand Africa and the islands of the sea.
-P-A-G-E-65
  
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 53 
5. One advantage of first ploughing our own fields, 
climbing our own mountains, and investing in our own 
factories, is that America is generous in simple geo- 
graphical lessons ; she throws out before our eyes, with 
a liberal hand, a few large, simple topics. Our corn and 
wheat fields are broad and many acred and their prod- 
ucts bulky, our forests and lumber-yards are almost 
monstrous, our cattle-ranches are big enough for coun- 
ties, our cotton-fields expand broadly under the 
Southern skies, and a bale of cotton can be seen a 
mile away. The Great Lakes, Niagara Falls, Colo- 
rado Canyon, Yosemite Valley, and the Mississippi 
River are big and simple. Our traffic routes by land 
and water are huge, continental; our manufactures 
are largely of the coarse, crude kind. Even some of 
our large cities are centres of trade for a very few 
bulky staples, as with Kansas City, Minneapolis, and 
others. Mere bigness is not a thing to boast of, but 
when combined with simplicity it is very suggestive 
to the teacher of geography. 
In selecting a series of topics for the fifth grade we 
may show a jealous preference for these giantlike 
topics of our American world. 
Moreover, in the fifth and sixth grade history lessons 
(dealing with early exploration and settlement) we are 
compelled to keep a sharp eye upon the strong physi- 
cal and climatic surroundings of the settlers. The 
term “physiography ”’ ishardly strong enough to express 
the biting reality of physical surroundings in pioneer 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
54 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
life. Nowhere else does physical geography so 
uncover its crude strength. Many of the pioneer 
stories, like those of Frémont, De Soto, Hudson, 
La Salle, Lewis and Clark, Robertson, and others, are 
unrivalled for the sharpness of their geographical im- 
pressions. A number of large geographic topics of a 
pronounced physiographic character (suggested by 
the history stories) should be worked over in these 
grades, such, for example, as the Columbia River, the 
trade route to India, a trip down the Ohio or Missis- 
sippi, the Equatorial Current, trade-winds, and Gulf 
Stream, and others. This close connection of history 
with geography is valuable also because it brings out 
the marked physical features of the country in their 
simplest relations to men. 
In the sixth grade some of the more complex topics 
of American trade, manufacture, and government may 
be handled, and difficult ideas of mathematical geog- 
raphy worked out. Such large and complex units 
of study as the Rocky Mountain system, the entire 
Mississippi Valley, the whole Appalachian highlands, 
and a bird’s-eye view of the physiography of North 
America should be reserved for the latter half of the 
sixth grade. This effort to build up a well-graded 
series of geographic topics through the fourth, fifth, 
and sixth grades (confined chiefly but not wholly to 
North America) is deserving of the serious study 
of teachers. The great variety of conditions in this 
country, from the simplest pastoral life of the plains
-P-A-G-E-67
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 5% 
with its sparse population to the thickly peopled manu 
facturing districts and cities of the East, displays a 
full range of subjects from the simple to the complex. 
Despite this early preference for America, an exam- 
ination of the topics selected for the course of study 
for these grades will bring to light a goodly number 
dealing with Europe and the world-whole. The 
topics suggested by the European history stories, and 
by the world navigators, also in connection with math- 
ematical geography, are quite sufficient to bring many 
other lands and the world-whole before the minds of 
the children. 
In order to bring simplicity and order into the vast 
multitude and variety of facts, furnished by the geog- 
raphy of North America, we need to grasp clearly 
the significance of types. A single leaf on a hard- 
maple tree is so much like all other hard-maple leaves 
that one may name it at a glance. If a stranger to 
the hard-maple should notice sharply a single typical 
hard-maple leaf, he would be able to recognize nearly 
all others. In the same way Mount Shasta as a typi- 
cal volcano, if well understood in its structure and 
history, is able to explain nearly all volcanic mountains. 
The same truth applies to most geographical objects. 
The number of classes of geographical objects is not 
very great, while the number of individuals in each 
class is legion. If we can convince ourselves that 
the thorough mastery of a relatively small number of 
important type objects goes a long way toward the
-P-A-G-E-68
ee ee ae 
56 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
mastery of the whole wide and varied field of geog: 
raphy, we may find it an excellent means of unbur- 
dening the mind and of subjugating the world to our 
thought. Those persons who thoughtlessly gorge 
the memory with geographic names and facts are like 
children collecting shells by the seaside. They fill 
their baskets, pockets, and hands with specimens in 
their zeal for collecting and then, being overloaded, 
begin to drop them. In sorting them out later at 
home, they find only a few kinds and, after selecting 
the best, they soon cast the others aside. 
In devising a plan for geographical study at least 
two important problems must be met :— 
1. The selection of a few important representative 
ideas out of the countless multitude of facts. 
2. A method of approach to these ideas which 
shall instruct and interest the children. 
The quantity of geographical knowledge is practi- 
cally infinite, a hundred times what any child can mas- 
ter. A wise choice of matter is, therefore, imperative. 
A proper study of types offers, we believe, a clear 
solution of both these problems. 
If not more than twenty or thirty topics are taken 
up during the year, from one and one-half to two 
weeks can be spent upon each topic. This is time 
sufficient to give to each important subject a reason- 
ably exhaustive discussion. 
Now, what are the advantages of such a discussion 
of really important types?  
-P-A-G-E-69
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 57 
1. A clear and detailed comprehension of a typical 
object in geography (however small this object may 
be) is the key to a large area of geographical knowl- 
edge. This type, once clearly perceived, is the 
interpreter of very many similar objects. A single 
coal mine seen in itself and in its relations to-the~ 
busy world is an almost perfect type of thousands of 
coal mines, to say nothing of other mines. A single 
river or mountain, pictured out in its variety of 
relations, is a sure exemplar of many others of the 
same kind. It is to be remembered that we should 
always select the best types for full study. The 
study of a type is, therefore, a short avenue to the 
interpretation of a large body of knowledge. 
2. A type subject is the basis of a series of com- 
parisons. The representative or type idea which 
it illustrates apnears again and again in a multitude 
of kindred objects. A full graphic account of the 
Illinois River from its source to its mouth is found, 
by later comparisons, to be a pretty fair description 
of a score of other rivers in the United States. In 
the same way the logging industry in one camp and 
along one stream is representative of such camps 
throughout the whole of the pine forests. 
If, therefore, we are careful to select good types 
and then, after treating them fully, to make sufficient 
comparisons to show the modifications of the type in 
different localities, we shall gain speedily an instruc- 
tive insight into large areas of geographical knowl 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
    58 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
edge. The original type subject becomes then a 
standard of measurement for the multitude of similar 
subjects that are sure to come up. Such a clear type 
is an interpreter and a test of each kindred subject 
the moment it appears. The extension of a typical 
idea by means of comparisons is a good opportunity 
for the children to think and to reason for them- 
selves; if it is a study of rivers, to examine the map 
and to interpret the slopes and structure, commerce 
and cities. 
Comparisons on the basis of fully developed types 
are the best means of veview. Reviews by means of 
comparing old with new topics are a vigorous and 
stimulating exercise. They throw new light on the 
old facts; they interpret the new. They group and 
consolidate geographical topics and develop the 
power to classify and organize knowledge. 
3. The number of type studies being few, much 
time is available for a lively, descriptive, and interest- 
ing investigation into details. Pictures and instruc- 
tive particulars are abundantly supplied. The work 
becomes very realistic and, as we say, concrete. 
Herein is found the very life of all instruction. Our 
text-books are usually stripped bare of this foliage 
and fruit of the tree, and a good teacher, from her 
own experience and from geographical readers, etc., 
should manage to supply it. 
It need scarcely be said that a full treatment of a 
topic like the pineries or the coal mine, is thoroughly
-P-A-G-E-71
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 59 
instructive and interesting to children. It satisfies a 
true thirst for knowledge. It explains a hundred facts 
they are anxious to know about. Instead of giving 
them a few barren statements to memorize, it responds 
to a child’s inquiries with a liberal supply of nourish- 
ing and palatable information. 
This detailed study of a type keeps us close to the 
objects and realities of the workaday world. We are 
not lost in general statements and abstractions, but 
are bumping constantly against the varied facts of 
experience. In other words, there is a powerful real- 
ism in this kind of study which gives a healthy tonic 
effect. The worst criticism that can be brought to 
bear upon our present teaching of geography is that 
it is abstract and unreal. It is formal and dry. We 
are not to forget, however, that, while such a type is 
very real and concrete, it contains a general truth of 
wide application. This general nature of the type, 
and the extent of its application, should be seen be- 
fore the discussion is dropped. Skill in teaching 
nearly every subject depends upon the teacher’s 
power to show the relation between the general 
truths of a subject and its particular objects and 
facts. The zype is the true mediator between these 
two extremes. 
4. The study of causes and causal relations. 
One of the chief reasons why children are interested 
in such a study of a type is, that it is, at every step, 
a study of causes, Children are often concerned
-P-A-G-E-72
  60 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
about facts, but they are still more inquisitive about 
causes. Unless their schooling has been very bad, 
they are strongly inclined to reason out the causal 
relations. In the study of the pineries, for example, 
every step in the process of lumbering from the skid- 
ding of the logs in the forest to the unloading of 
lumber on the Western prairies is an adaptation of 
labor, skill, and machinery to the physical conditions 
imposed by surface, climate, rivers, prairies, etc., @ 
tracing of cause and effect. It is a fine thing fot 
children to see this application of labor and skill and 
to have their interest strongly awakened in many 
forms of human endeavor. We should realize, how- 
ever, that causal relations cannot be clearly seen 
unless a topic is treated with fulness. Our geographies 
give us a few barren, meagre facts, too much stripped 
of detail to show their relations. By means of the 
more exhaustive treatment of a typical subject, we 
see it in its varied causal relations, we perceive the 
modifying or controlling influences which determine 
its character. In each of the examples given, Illinois 
River, coal mine, prairies, pineries, etc., the links 
which connect different topics together are welded by 
a perception of causal relations. But what is true of 
these topics is true of every typical subject which is 
delineated with sufficient fulness to reveal the true 
causal sequences. This is the point at which outlines 
or brief epitomes utterly fail. They may state impor- 
tant facts, but they cannot reveal the causal nexus.
-P-A-G-E-73
  GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 61 
It is necessary to enter upon the deeper details in 
order to catch a glimpse of working causes. 
But this more penetrating study into a topic brings 
us in close contact with other branches of knowledge, 
and so we come to see the importance of the relations 
of geography to other studies. A full investigation 
of a coal mine, for example, shows plainly how the 
roots of geography are intertwined with the roots of 
other sciences. Children are almost certain to ask 
how coal came to be stored in the earth, a question 
which leads back into the history of the earth’s crust, 
into atmospheric and climatic conditions, into plant 
life and to great physical and chemical changes. The 
use of powder and other explosive materials in blast- 
ing, the collection and explosion of gases in mines, 
the safety-lamp and mine ventilation, the steam- 
engines, pumps, and ventilating-fans, the combustion 
of coal, the production of coal-gas, etc., are topics 
that belong to physics, chemistry, and practical 
mechanics. So many and intimate are the linkings 
with other studies that the chief danger of such an 
exhaustive treatment of a coal mine is that both 
teacher and class may be switched off the main geo- 
graphical track, and get lost in the history of geologi- 
cal changes, in the chemical composition of coal, in the 
physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and of 
explosives or in some other purely scientific topic. 
The only safety is to grasp firmly the main outlines 
of the geographical subject and to treat all these
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
other sciences, however intimate, as tributary and in. 
cidental. So far as they directly explain geographi- 
cal facts they should be drawn upon. 
To further illustrate the significance of these causal 
relations of geographical topics to each other, and to 
the natural sciences, suppose we give a full descrip- 
tion to Pikes Peak and vicinity, including the vale of 
Manitou, the mineral springs, the Garden of the Gods, 
Cheyenne Canyon and Falls, the caves, the trail to the 
peak, the views of distant mountains, the snow-line, 
the rock-strewn summit, the vegetation, winds, air- 
pressure, the stratified and igneous rocks, the gorges 
and mountain torrents, the surrounding mountain 
groups, the railroad to the summit, the peak in winter, 
etc. Such a particularized study of a geographical type 
not only brings out a closely related body of repre- 
sentative geographical ideas, causally bound together, 
but it plunges us deep among the roots of the other 
sciences upon which geography rests, e.g. geologic 
strata and changes, the physics of air-pressure, vegeta- 
tion, and animal life in mountain districts ; the chemis- 
try of mineral waters, railroad-engineering in mountain 
canyons ; winds, snows, and meteorology, erosion by 
ice and water. In the midst of such a region nature 
also shows herself beautiful and refreshing, or grand 
and rugged for the culture of the zesthetic and religious 
sense. What does the usual study of geography give 
us to treasure up from sucha region? Ought not a 
detailed and instructive description of such a type,
-P-A-G-E-75
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 63 
aided by pictures, give us a score of attractive views 
into the very workshop of nature? From the rock- 
strewn summit of Pikes Peak to the health-giving 
springs that gush from its roots at Manitou, this 
whole region is bathed in science as in sunlight. 
Yet our purpose is not to teach natural science, but 
geography, as causally based upon natural science. 
True insight into any topic, and appreciation of its 
value, are based chiefly upon the causal chains which 
link it to other kinds of knowledge. 
5. After the full description of a topic, such, for 
example, as a coal mine in Pennsylvania, and the study 
of its important relation to railroads, factories, etc., it 
is compared with other coal mines along the Alle- 
ghanies, in Illinois, and other parts of the United 
States ; the great coal fields are located on the map, 
and a few of the chief shipping-points for coal, as New 
York, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Cleveland, Chicago, and 
St. Louis, are located. We may even compare later 
the whole coal production of the United States with 
that of England and Germany and get some grasp of 
its vast importance to the whole country and the 
world. In this manner a type study expands grad- 
ually to embrace a large collection of geographical 
facts. But they are all well arranged around a single 
centre of thought. This is a marked improvement 
over the old plan in geographies of learning the scat- 
tered facts about coal and coal production in connec: 
tion with a dozen or more different states at different
-P-A-G-E-76
    64 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
times, months apart, and never attempting to bring 
them together as one connected body of facts. The 
practice of heaping up a miscellaneous quantity of 
facts in connection with California or Connecticut is 
essentially bad because there is no real centre of 
thought, no unity or connection between the facts. 
So far as a state has a political unity it should be 
often used to designate a district of country and to 
some extent a physical and climatic character, but the 
great commercial and physiographic units of study pay 
very little heed to state boundaries. 
This movement from home outward on the stepping: 
stones of great typical subjects is in strong contrast 
to the custom of memorizing mere facts more or less 
fragmentary and disconnected. The chief merits of 
the type studies are, first, that they deal in full 
measure with concrete and interesting details, and, 
second, that they lead to strong, clear geographical 
concepts. The fact-cramming process is neither in- 
structive by means of concrete pictures nor rich in 
significant concepts. It is essentially empty and bar- 
ren. Like a dead tree stretching its naked and deso- 
late arms toward the sky, such an instruction has 
neither leaves nor fruit to clothe it with beauty nor a 
life-giving sap to attest its vitality. 
6. To what extent does the series of types, which 
we have outlined, cover the whole field of geographi- 
cal studies for these grades? Only a few topics are 
fully treated, and many important facts may appear
-P-A-G-E-77
  GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 65 
to be neglected. How far will the product of such a 
year’s study be complete and systematic rather than 
fragmentary and disconnected? It is not claimed 
that the treatment of single types will give fulness 
and completeness to all these studies but only that 
the series of types furnishes a safe central line of 
operations. To supplement and complete the work 
with types we shall need map studies and map draw- 
ings, comprehensive surveys, reviews, and drills, and 
abundant use of text-books and wall maps. The for- 
mation of important and significant series of geograph- 
ical objects will bind together the larger units as well 
as the smaller. For example, the great commercial 
routes of the Mississippi Valley from east to west, 
and from north to south, the climatic zones, the large 
river valleys and mountain-chains will bind together 
the separate facts into larger series and complexes. 
But the type studies themselves, if followed out, will 
lead to an organic building up of large geographical 
groups and sequences. The study of Pikes Peak and 
the neighboring mountain cluster, when compared 
with Gray’s, Frémont’s, and the Spanish peaks, leads 
on to a knowledge of the main ridge of the Rocky 
Mountains of which they are striking parts. The 
study of Lake Superior leads to an understanding of 
the series of great lakes and of this important line of 
water traffic between the East and West. The de. 
scription of the hardwood forests of Indiana is incom- 
plete till the whole extensive Ohio Valley, with the 
F
-P-A-G-E-78
  
  66 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
tributary streams, is drawn in. The very idea of a 
type study involves the necessity of reaching out so 
as to embrace a large number of kindred objects into 
one connected series or group. If we have succeeded 
in selecting the important types of the Mississippi 
Valley, a proper comparison and extension of these 
types will draw in most of the cities, rivers, lakes, 
mountains, etc., that deserve a child’s attention. If 
any are left out, it is because they are not important 
or characteristic enough to demand notice. We are 
disposed to omit all geographical names which have 
nothing in particular to recommend them, nothing 
which they help to illustrate or explain. A great 
many geographical objects are of local importance, of 
which a child, for the present, can afford to remain 
entirely ignorant. 
Our further plan is to follow in fifth and sixth 
grades a series of type studies through the Atlantic 
and Pacific States, British America, and Mexico, clos- 
ing the work with a conclusive survey of North 
America as a whole. North America then becomes 
our type of a continent with which we may set out to 
measure more accurately the other continents of the 
world. Our general movement is toward ever larger 
and more complex wholes. It is, in the main, 
synthetic. 
7. In following the series of type studies for North 
America we are not neglecting physical geography, 
though we get at it from a somewhat different
-P-A-G-E-79
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 67 
approach. Many of the great types are strongly 
physiographic, while the immediate bearings upon 
man’s interests are included. Our purpose is to 
bring physiographic facts into such close relation to 
human needs as to make both of them tangible, real- 
istic, and often picturesque. The pioneer history 
stories add greatly to the emphasis given to topog- 
raphy, climate, etc. 
A whole continent does not seem to us a suitable 
subject for detailed treatment in fourth grade. In 
spite of sand-building and modelling it remains largely 
a formal and barren subject. Short surveys of the 
whole world and a somewhat fuller treatment of North 
America may well preface the series of typical studies 
we have outlined. But they should be brief and pre- 
liminary, merely a bird’s-eye view. By a constant 
use of wall maps of the United States and of North 
America, by means of the broader comparisons and 
surveys which close up the treatment of every typical 
subject, we are steadily marching toward a clear and 
definite understanding of the great physical features 
, of the Mississippi Valley and of North America. The 
characteristic regions of production are brought out 
with great distinctness, and when we finally reach the 
point where the Mississippi Valley as a whole can be 
surveyed, how rich and varied do its resources appear ! 
What variety of surface, landscape, and climate! How 
closely connected by water and rail! The whole Mis- 
sissippi Valley finally becomes the type of a mighty
-P-A-G-E-80
68 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
river basin, with which the largest and most fruitful 
river basins of the world may be later compared. 
Finally, we may say a word of the effect of this more 
deliberate and thoroughgoing study of North Amer- 
ica upon the work with Europe and the other conti- 
nents in seventh and eighth grades. To approach 
Europe and Asia with a rich and in part well-organized 
fund of knowledge of our own country is altogether de- 
sirable. We shall not find many things in Europe that 
are wholly new to us, and a quick intelligent eye will 
speedily discern how much like America Europe is. 
Their food and clothes, their governments and cities, 
their mountains and rivers, their languages and 
churches, their homes and schools are very much like 
ours. In some respects they are better off, in others 
worse. To keep the minds of children alert and active 
in comparing these and other things on the two sides 
of the Atlantic opens one of the most hopeful oppor- 
tunities for doing thoughtful, rational work. 
EXAMPLE OF THE TREATMENT OF A TYPE 
NIAGARA FALLS AND THE COMMERCE OF THE GREAT LAKES 
Niagara Falls lie midway between Lake Ontario and 
Lake Erie. Lake Erie is nearly 300 feet higher 
above the sea-level than Lake Ontario. About 
six miles south of Lake Ontario the level plateau in 
whose basin Lake Erie lies drops down 300 feet to the 
plain which borders Lake Ontario. The Niagara
-P-A-G-E-81
  
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 69 
River, in making its way from Lake Erie to Lake 
Ontario, must leap over this bluff or escarpment. At 
the present time the falls are about six miles back 
from the edge of the escarpment. A stratum of lime- 
stone rocks 140 feet.thick extends from the edge of 
this escarpment southward and, dipping gradually, 
passes under Lake Erie. The Niagara River, as it 
flows northward, drops over this ledge of limestone 
rocks at the present site of the falls. It is 160 feet 
from the edge of the cataract to the level of the river 
below. The remainder of the 300 feet of descent is 
made by the rapids above and below the falls and by the 
descent of the river. The falls on the American side 
are small and, in fact, constitute a part of the east 
bank of the river. The great Horseshoe Falls, which 
lie to the west of Goat Island, constitute the main 
part of the falls. Here the enormous body of water 
tumbles into a great chasm from three sides, and it is 
here that the main action of the water in grinding out 
the rocks takes place. Above the falls is a great series 
of limestone ledges, over which the broad river 
plunges, forming a wilderness of waters, as seen from 
the Three Sisters Islands, very grand and impressive. 
In fact, the view up the river from the Three Sisters 
is one of the grandest scenes in nature. The Horse- 
shoe Falls can be best appreciated from the Maid of 
the Mist as it sails up under the waters from below. 
Below the falls is the deep, narrow gorge, 
with its precipitous walls nearly 300 feet high,
-P-A-G-E-82
7o SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
through the narrow bottom of which gushes the swift 
river. How was this gorge formed? It extends 
about six miles to the edge of the escarpment. As 
the water tumbles over the edge of the falls, it de- 
scends into the river 200 feet deep. The underlying 
rocks beneath the limestone ledge, already described, 
are soft shales and sandstone. The rushing waters 
at the foot of the falls gradually wash out great caves 
in the softer rock, and the superincumbent mass of 
projecting limestone breaks off in great chunks and 
tumbles into the bottom of the river. In the centre 
of the Horseshoe Falls, where the water from three 
sides plunges into the deep caldron, the action of the 
water is so powerful as to grind up these loose rocks 
at the bottom and sweep the sand down the river. 
On the edges of the gorge, where the action of the 
water is less powerful, the broken rocks are not 
ground up, and form a sloping side or talus which is 
found on both sides of the gorge throughout its 
course. In this way it has been found by close meas- 
urements that the falls are yearly receding toward the 
south, in the middle of the Horseshoe Falls, at the rate 
of from four to six feet a year. During the present 
century, the measurements have been quite accu- 
rate, so that the rate of recession is somewhat defi- 
nitely known, With this asa basis efforts have been 
made to reckon the number of years necessary for the 
formation of the gorge, but the estimates have varied 
from 6,000 to 30,000 years, The gorge between the
-P-A-G-E-83
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 71 
falls and the escarpment is a most interesting scenic 
object. An electric railway descends along theeastern 
edge of the gorge and, passing close by the whirlpool 
rapids, proceeds along the foot of the cliffs till it 
reaches Lewiston at the outlet of the gorge. Here 
the Niagara River widens intoa lordly stream, deep 
and broad, as it courses toward Lake Ontario. An- 
other electric railway climbs the escarpment on the 
Canadian side, and on its return to the falls gives ex- 
cellent views of the river and gorge from above. 
If heavily laden grain ships start from Chicago or 
Duluth, how far can they proceed down the Lakes 
before stopping to unload? If it were not for 
Niagara Falls, they would not stop at Buffalo, but 
pass on to Lake Ontario, and perhaps down the St. 
Lawrence on their way to Europe or New York. As 
a matter of fact, all the Great Lake vessels, moving 
eastward, are compelled to unload their cargoes at 
Buffalo. If it were not for Niagara Falls, would there 
be any need of an Erie Canal? or a Welland Canal? 
Would there be any great city at Buffalo? If large 
vessels could pass freely from Lake Erie to Lake 
Ontario, what part of the Erie Canal would still be ser- 
viceable? There is at present a branch of the canal 
from Oswego to the main canal and Albany. In this 
case, what sort of a city would Oswego be? Perhaps 
the main body of commerce would go down the St. 
Lawrence, but there are difficulties in the navigation 
of the St. Lawrence, such as the rapids, which have 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  72 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
made canals necessary, the short season of navigation 
at the mouth of the St. Lawrence, so far to the north, 
and the fact that all of this commerce must pass 
through a foreign country. The probability is, there- 
fore, that the canal, in any case, would extend from 
Oswego to Albany. 
So far as commerce is concerned, Niagara Falls 
are an enormous obstruction, making necessary the 
expenditure of many millions of dollars on canals and 
railways. Moreover, the traffic route from Chicago, 
Duluth, and the Lake cities is by many times the 
most important traffic route in America, and Niagara 
lies at its centre, obstructing all free commercial 
intercourse. The vast importance of this trade route 
may be seen in the quantity of great staple products 
like corn, wheat, and packed meats which are shipped 
from Chicago and the other Lake cities to Buffalo, 
New York, and Europe. The greatest railroad trunk 
lines follow this route, such as the Michigan Central, 
the New York Central, the Nickel Plate, and others. 
On the other hand, do the great falls perform any 
service to man to compensate for this inconvenience 
and difficulty? There is immense water-power from 
the falls, and a group of mills on the east side for 
many years has used a very small fraction of the 
water for moving mill-wheels. But within the last 
few years engineers have constructed great water- 
wheels near the falls for producing water-power and 
for converting this power into electrical force. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 73 
being utilized by mills and factories and street-car 
lines within a radius of twenty miles from the falls. 
So great is the amount of power which can be gener- 
ated at the falls and put to use in factories and shops 
that it is expected that the country about Niagara 
Falls will become, in time, the greatest manufactur- 
ing centre in the world. Another reason for these 
hopes is the fact that raw products of many kinds can 
be shipped to this point at little expense. 
In the early history of explorations we find that 
Hennepin and La Salle, in trying to navigate the 
upper lakes, met their greatest difficulties at Niagara 
Falls. It was necessary to carry a heavy forge and 
tools over the bluff and along the river to a point six 
or seven miles above the falls, where, in the rigors of 
a severe winter, forest trees were cut down and a 
vessel was built for the navigation of the upper lakes. 
It was called the Gvifiz and was used by La Salle 
and his party in their first trip to Mackinaw and 
Green Bay. The Columbus caravels, which were 
objects of such interest at the Columbian Exposition, 
were taken up the St. Lawrence River and through 
the Welland Canal, reaching Chicago by way of the 
Lakes. Some of the smaller whaleback steamers have 
made the trip from Duluth through the locks at St. 
Marys Canal, the Lakes, and the Welland Canal, 
down the St. Lawrence to Liverpool. 
Geologists have been anxious to determine the 
number of centuries since the Niagara River began to
-P-A-G-E-86
74 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
cut its gorge. In this way they would be able to 
determine the length of time since the glacial period 
or the ice age in North America. The great glacial 
sheet gliding down from the north at one time filled 
Lake Ontario so that the Niagara River could find 
no outlet into Lake Ontario. At that time the 
upper lakes must have found an outlet in some other 
direction. The old channel by which Lake Michigan 
sent its waters into the Illinois and Mississippi has 
been found. As the ice receded toward the north, 
and the waters from Lake Erie were first sent via 
Niagara over the escarpment toward Lake Ontario, 
the outlet of the St. Lawrence was still obstructed by 
ice. In those days the outlet to Lake Ontario was 
by way of the Mohawk and Hudson, and the old 
channel has been found. If this were still true, it 
would remove some of the difficulties of our 
navigation. 
If we compare the falls of Niagara, its gorge and 
rapids, with the falls of St. Anthony at Minneapolis, 
we shall find that a similar gorge extends from Min- 
neapolis down the Mississippi about five miles to its 
junction with the Minnesota. But this gorge is only 
about one-third as deep, though about the same width 
as the Niagara gorge. An examination of the rock 
strata at St. Anthony’s Falls will reveal also a similar 
series of rocks, hard limestone above and softer rock 
beneath, and a similar recession of the falls. At 
Minneapolis, however, great flour-mills worth millions 
 
-P-A-G-E-87
GEOGRAPHY OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADES 75 
of dollars have been established at the western edge 
of the falls, and the recession of the falls would ren- 
der them useless. To prevent this a heavy frame- 
work of wooden chutes has been built and heavily 
buttressed, so as to completely cover the rocks at the 
falls and prevent them from wearing away, thus mak- 
ing the falls stationary. But the old scenic beauty 
has been destroyed. At Rochester, New York, 
where the Genesee River plunges over the escarp- 
ment toward Lake Ontario, a series of falls and 
gorges is found which is explained in the same man- 
ner as Niagara Falls. It will be of interest to com- 
pare other falls in North America, like those of the 
upper Missouri, Yellowstone Falls in the park, and 
the falls of the Columbia, with those of Niagara, to 
see if similar causes are operative. Later, in the 
study of Europe, Africa, and other lands, we may 
compare the falls of the Rhine, of the Nile, the Zam- 
bezi, and the Congo with those of Niagara, in their 
effect upon navigation and traffic.

CHAPTER V 
EUROPE —SEVENTH GRADE 
Tue third great centre of geographical study is 
Europe. In thus selecting the smallest of the great 
continents as the centre of the world’s geography, we 
are granting a large influence to the historical or 
human side of geography. Europe is undoubtedly 
the centre from which all exploration and conquest 
of the world, in the last four hundred years and 
more, have gone out. From Europe have sprung 
the hardy and intelligent races that have had the 
energy to explore and master the world. Since we 
are studying the earth as related to man, we can 
hardly escape from this powerful historical drift. 
After completing the previous studies of North 
America, there lies before us the choice of a move- 
ment to South America and the Southern Hemi- 
sphere, or tothe East and to Europe. We are bound 
to Europe by historical and commercial relations 
and, also, by bonds of language and kindred which 
are more important than the structural resemblance 
between North and South America. Not only is 
Europe nearer to us and easier to reach, but the 
historical and literary associations between North 
76
-P-A-G-E-89
  
  EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 77 
America and Europe are already familiar to the 
children in many of the best myths and stories of 
childhood, in the heroic tales of early European 
history, and in the voyages of the early explorers, 
such as Columbus, Magellan, Raleigh, Drake, and 
others. The children are familiar with many stories 
of English history, of Greece, of Italy, and of the 
Bible lands, and even with the maps of those coun- 
tries. Our population has come to America mainly 
from Europe, and many of the people trace their 
kindred back among the different peoples of Europe. 
The great trade routes over which our surplus prod- 
ucts are sent to foreign lands have already been 
traced to Europe in discussing topics of our own 
geography. The climatic conditions, productions, 
industries, commerce, seaports, and inland seas of 
Europe furnish topics more resembling those of 
America than of any other country, and they may 
well be compared with similar topics already studied 
in America. In many ways the study of Europe is 
simply an enlargement of our American geography. 
Our work in the seventh grade, therefore, will consist 
of a carefully selected series of topics on the geog- 
raphy of Europe. 
It might appear at first glance that so small a con- 
tinent as Europe would hardly require our study for 
a whole year, but a closer scrutiny will bring to light 
a surprising number of most interesting and instructive 
topics — more than enough to occupy our full time.

  78 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
In striking contrast to the United States, Europe 
is split up into a large number of distinct and isolated 
nationalities, based upon equally distinct physical 
divisions. In Europe there are fifteen different na- 
tionalities speaking as many different languages and 
separated from each other in most cases by moun 
tains or seas. 
While in North America there is a single powerful 
nation, in Europe there are five great powers and as 
many more, each, of second and third rate powers. 
All these things considered (the variety of physical 
structure and of national life) give the geography of 
Europe a very large number of strong, distinctive 
topics. When we consider that these are the fore- 
most nations of the world, and have attained in va- 
rious ways the highest arts of living, have carried 
mining, agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and the 
fine arts to a higher degree of perfection than else- 
where in the world, the lessons of European geog- 
raphy will prove of highest value. The applications 
of science to life in intensive agriculture, in the 
making of fine pottery, silks, and textile fabrics, the 
museums and superior art products, the splendid 
architecture in churches and public buildings, the 
ruins of ancient cities, castles, and roads, the far- 
famed scenery of mountains, lakes, and rivers, the 
aristocratic forms of government and society, are all 
worthy of careful study. 
The history of Europe during the last two thou
-P-A-G-E-91
EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 79 
sand years and more is of far greater value to us than 
that of any other continent except our own, and is, in 
fact, a part of our own earlier life. Our ancestors, in 
contact with the physical surroundings of Europe, 
left there a record of many memorable events, and 
these historical associations greatly intensify the in- 
terest in geography. 
Europe, in contrast to the United States, has a 
great variety of nations speaking different languages. 
In the United States we have emigrants from all 
these countries but most of them learn to speak Eng- 
lish and the children go to school and are soon fully 
Americanized. 
In studying the geography of Europe it is inter- 
esting to observe the peculiar character and customs 
of each of the important nations, as the French, the 
Scotch and English, the Germans, and the Russians. 
In the north central part of Europe the Germans 
have lived for many centuries, forming a group of 
states. They include not only the north German 
states but a large part of Austria and Switzerland. 
They all speak one language, have a common litera- 
ture, and similar customs which mark them off as 
Germans. They have always been physically sturdy 
and vigorous and have kept up and developed their 
strength by training in the gymnasia or turner halls. 
Their severe army drill is also supposed to cultivate 
physical strength. It is customary to live much in 
the open air and to take long walks into the open

country. The school children are led out by their 
teachers upon shorter and longer excursions. The 
parks and open concert gardens are frequented by 
thousands of people. 
Since the days of the Roman generals, Marius and 
Julius Czesar, two thousand years ago, the Germans 
have been engaged from time to time in warlike con- 
flicts with the surrounding nations. 
During the last fifty years, more than any other 
nation, they have carried military training and prep- 
aration for war to an extreme. The government of 
Germany centering in the Kaiser and a military class 
still further increased this dangerous and warlike 
spirit. In the great war just closed this has ended 
in disaster to Germany. 
What were formerly thought of as the better quali- 
ties of the German people, such as their home and 
family life, their devotion to music and education, 
have been overshadowed by this excessive military 
ambition. The better things have been put in the 
background and other nations as well as Germany 
have suffered a great loss. 
In spite of their progress in science and education 
the Germans are still backward in some ways. In 
inventions and the use of machinery on the farms 
they lag behind the people of America. Much of 
the wheat harvest is still gathered by hand by the 
use of the old-fashioned cradle, although modern 
reapers are sometimes seen in their fields). The 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
* EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 81 
cities with their narrow crooked streets and antique 
houses, in some cases are still surrounded by the old 
walls and moat and are objects of curious interest to 
travelers from America. Such are Nuremberg and 
some of the towns along the Rhine. The ruins of 
many ancient castles, built hundreds of years ago, 
are found along the Danube, the Rhine, and other 
streams. 
The Germans of Central Europe have increased 
rapidly in numbers and many have emigrated to 
foreign lands. For many years German immigrants 
have come in large numbers to the United States. 
Embarking at Hamburg and Bremen thousands of 
them have crossed the Atlantic to find homes in this 
country. The population of some of our large cities, 
as Cincinnati, Chicago, and Milwaukee, is made“up 
largely of Germans. Nearly one fifth of the popu- 
lation of the United States is composed of Germans 
and their descendants. 
A comparison of the Germans with other nations 
of Europe will bring out interesting contrasts. 
The Latin nations of southern Europe, including 
Italians, French, and Spaniards, form a kindred group 
distinctly contrasted with the Germans. 
There are other European peoples equally worthy of 
this descriptive treatment and study, as the French, 
the Irish, the Italians, the Scandinavians, the Rus- 
sians, to say nothing of the Dutch, Scotch, and Eng- 
lish. If we can get deep enough into the meaning 
S
-P-A-G-E-94
  82 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
and quality of these national types, we shali give a 
touch of true cosmopolitanism to the studies of school 
children. 
As partly indicated above, the study of European 
topics furnishes a remarkably good opportunity for 
a comparative review of similar American subjects 
previously studied. There are strong reasons for 
making such comparisons systematic and regular. 
1. Many American topics previously studied in 
America are surprisingly similar to those of Europe. 
Especially is this true in the treatment of rivers, moun- 
tains, cities, commercial routes, and the chief manu- 
factures. A comparison of Hamburg and New York in 
point of harbor, commerce, river, canal, and ocean con- 
nections, population, etc., is the means of making the 
facts about each stand out with singular distinctness. 
2. The previous full study of similar topics in 
the United States makes it possible to give a quick 
and complete interpretation to those of Europe. If 
children have enjoyed a full description of the diffi- 
culties and expense of making the Hoosac Tunnel, 
they will very quickly grasp the still greater difficul- 
ties of the St. Gothard Tunnel through the Alps and 
the advantages of the same. A swift and accurate 
interpretation of new topics is one of the greatest 
achievements of later geographic work. If the pupils 
have studied in descriptive detail the building of 
wooden and iron ships at Bath, Maine, they will 
steam up the Clyde River at Glasgow and give a
-P-A-G-E-95
  
EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 83 
quick and true interpretation to the greatest ship- 
building mart of the world. 
3. To place the leading topics of Europe and Amer- 
ica side by side and measure them one upon another 
is to reveal a large number of very instructive re- 
semblances and contrasts. Such a comparison goes 
much deeper than the formal statement ; for example, 
that the United States now produces more tons of 
pig-iron than England. Such lump statements are 
common in the geographies, but do not greatly en- 
lighten a child. The detailed treatment of a few 
type studies in the United States has supplied the 
children with a body of specific items of informa- 
tion on leading topics that makes a fuller compari- 
son on those points very interesting and richly 
suggestive. 
A comparison, for example, of Berlin with Chicago 
(two cities of nearly equal size) will reveal the surpris- 
ing fact that in the last fifty years Berlin has been 
growing nearly if not quite as fast as Chicago. We 
already know the big commercial advantages that 
have caused Chicago to grow like a mushroom. But 
Berlin has almost none of these advantages. Situated 
on a barren, sandy plain, with no natural facilities for 
water-transportation, she has leaped into the race 
with Chicago and has kept up an even pace with her. 
What can be the explanation of this? Berlin has 
clean streets and a careful, thrifty, economic manage 
ment of city affairs. Chicago—! %

84 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
4. Such comparisons furnish a singularly interest- 
ing review of American topics. One of the standard 
illustrations of dulness and ennui in studies is review 
lessons in geography. It takes no great gift of imag- 
ination to picture the yawning, sleepy schoolboy as 
he sprawls over these delectable tasks, If there 
were a necessity for this sort of machine effort in the 
economy of life, we would not quarrel with destiny, 
but we are disposed, as Lowell says, “not to go about 
to make life duller than it is.” 
It is quite easy to see that a small degree of inge- 
nuity on the teacher’s part, instituting specific com- 
parisons between American and European topics of 
like physiognomy, is able to set the whole mental 
machinery into throbbing action. Such a compari- 
son stirs up a whole nest of thought-producing 
problems and makes lessons to bristle with sensible 
questions. 
In discussing the coal production of England, we 
notice that England is much smaller in size, popula- 
tion, and area of coal fields than the United States, and 
yet, until recently, the coal production of England 
was greater than ours. Explain this. Many of the 
greatest cities of Europe, as Berlin, Paris, Moscow, 
Rome, and Madrid, have but little natural advantage 
for water traffic. In the United States not a single 
large city but has first-class water facilities. Why 
this contrast? A more elaborate illustration of the 
comparison of a topic of Europe with that of the
-P-A-G-E-97
EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 85 
United States (the Rhine and the Hudson) is given 
at the close of Chapter X. 
This question may well be asked, whether the 
method of comparative review is not potential enough 
to take the place, mainly, of the usual forms of review. 
We believe that this system of comparative survey is 
quite sufficient-to keep up a vivid and constant re- 
view of earlier geographic studies, so as to allow the 
children each year an entrance to new and interesting 
fields of study, and to put an end to the dull reitera- 
tion and rehashing of old subjects of study. 
5. Another effect of these comparisons is an or- 
ganization and consolidation of geographical informa- 
tion around a few great centres of thought. This 
grouping and classifying of facts is what gives, in 
the end, simplicity to the varieties of knowledge. It 
ends in the grasp of a few leading principles, and we 
have the surprising result that the more facts we 
accumulate and the wider the range and variety of 
our information, the more simple and transparent to 
the mental eye it becomes ; of course, this means that 
we are getting at the science of the subject. 
If we were to study Europe without reference 
to America, we might easily arrive at the conclu- 
sion that they are two strikingly distinct and in- 
congruous geographical subjects, with very little 
fundamental agreement, but this is very far from 
the truth, even so far as the capacity of school 
children is concerned.  
-P-A-G-E-98
86 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
6. It is quite possible by these comparative re 
views to produce in the children an unwonted degree 
of thoughtfulness and self-activity. Children of the 
seventh grade are competent for this sort of effort if 
they possess the accumulated resources of knowledge 
to form the basis of comparisons. For this we have, 
however, abundantly provided in the fruitful type 
studies of fourth, fifth, and sixth grades and by the 
further treatment of a few similar topics in Europe. 
The independent thought-process depends upon the 
setting up of problems for solution. In the “ Special 
Method in History” this problem-solving work was 
elaborately discussed and illustrated. Butit is quite 
as well adapted to the work in geography. The prob- 
lem in the form of an equation, involving one or two 
unknown quantities, is the normal way of stating a 
geography topic in this grade. At least, this is the 
case after the main descriptive facts of the new les- 
son have been presented. After getting at the physi- 
ography of the Danube Valley, its cities, commerce, 
bordering states, difficulties of navigation, and rela- 
tion to the Black Sea and Rhine, we may set the 
children to comparing the Danube with the Ohio to 
see which of the two is the more important navigable 
river. They may examine the maps and descriptions 
of those valleys, the productiveness of the regions 
through which they flow, the size and character of 
their cities, the importance of tributary streams, the 
significance of the Danube as a route connecting
-P-A-G-E-99
EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 87 
still larger traffic routes than itself, the mountain bar- 
riers from which they rise, and the character and 
number of the people. There is scarcely an impor- 
tant topic of European geography that will not re- 
ceive a flood of light by such a comparison with some 
suitable, similar topic in North America. 
In such comparisons the strong contrasts are a 
great source of interest and clearness of thought. 
The diminutive size of important European countries 
as compared with our states is often surprising. 
England is half as large as Colorado, and has fifty 
times as many people. France is about one-third 
larger than California. The Hudson River is one- 
third as long as the Rhine, and drains scarcely more 
than one-sixth as large an area, and yet, for purposes 
of shipping, the Hudson is deeper and broader than 
the Rhine. The great traffic routes of the United 
States by rail run east and west across mountains and 
plains, almost disregarding the physical structure of 
the lands. The great traffic routes of Europe adapt 
themselves in the eomplicated physical structure. 
The internal waterways of America are naturally 
of surprising value and extent, but by means of 
artificial canals and slack-water navigation the rivers 
of France and Germany give a wonderfully cheap 
transportation of heavy staples. 
Quite a number of topics of European geography 
dealing with the crude products of agriculture, min- 
ing, and manufacture will require but brief treatment 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
    88 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
in Europe. Lumbering, iron-mining, grain produc. 
tion, cattle-raising, wool-growing, and other raw pro. 
duction have been described in such complete pictures 
in the United States that it would be a waste of time 
to describe them again with equal fulness in Europe. 
A quick bird’s-eye view of each of these great indus- 
tries will lead at once to significant comparisons with 
similar things at home. 
In this way, also, we shall gain time for a full de- 
scription of the famous and more venerable objects 
of this old civilization: St. Paul’s and St. Peter’s in 
London and in Rome, the famous palaces and art gal- 
leries of Paris, the lakes of Scotland, old Edinburgh, 
the Acropolis and the Alhambra, the Gothic churches 
of the Rhine, the Kremlin and the houses of Par- 
liament, the picture gallery at Dresden, and the ruins 
of Rome and Pompeii. Not so much words as pic- 
tures and scenes, drawings and graphic portrayals of 
these most characteristic and remarkable objects of 
Europe, are necessary. 
For five or six years, in a proper school course, the 
children have been collecting history story, legend, 
poem, and biography of the great scenes and persons 
of European history. The geography lessons should 
take advantage of the intense interest thus awakened 
in European geography and bring the brilliant side- 
lights of history to bear upon these European topics. 
No country affords such an opportunity for this as 
Europe. The Prince Albert Monument in Hyde

  EUROPE—SEVENTH GRADE 89 
Park, London, the Castle of Heidelberg, the shrines 
of Westminster Abbey, Abbotsford, Windsor Castle, 
the monument to Germania opposite Bingen on the 
Rhine, Napoleon’s Arch of Triumph in Paris, the 
Tell Chapel on Lake Lucerne, and the Columbus 
Monument at Genoa are but examples. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  CHAPTER VI 
EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY 
TuosE parts of the world outside of Europe and 
North America supply the topics for our geography 
in the eighth grade: Asia, Africa, the Indies, and 
South America, with the remaining seas and oceans. 
This furnishes a wide variety of large topics not 
easily organized into a simple plan. It contains the 
widest diversity of surface, climates, populations, and 
stages of culture from barbarism upward. How to 
organize this extraordinary variety into an instructive 
and coherent plan of studies is our problem. 
Observe, first, that long before reaching the eighth 
grade, according to our plan of study, the children 
have become somewhat familiar with these countries. 
In the home geography, in third and fourth grades, 
they have visited China and Japan, South America 
and Africa. In their survey of the world-whole, they 
learned to know and name the large land masses and 
oceans. In intermediate grades they crossed the 
oceans with Columbus and Magellan, and coasted 
the shores of the chief islands and continents. 
Many of the geographical topics previously studied, 
ge 
 
-P-A-G-E-103
  
  EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY gl 
as the old trade routes to India, the Portuguese explo 
rations along the coasts of Africa, the colonial posses- 
sions of Spain and Portugal, and the chief topics of 
mathematical geography in the sixth grade have given 
definite knowledge on a number of large topics. 
But we are now to sift out a few of the more 
prominent and instructive topics of this broad and 
varied field for such enlarged treatment as will conduce 
to real intelligence and a better classified information. 
In this as in other fields of geographical study, we 
believe in taking full possession of a few command- 
ing positions, getting the mastery of a few most 
significant topics. 
If a teacher were strongly possessed with the idea 
of learning the names and locations of places, prov- 
inces, productions, etc., these regions offer a very 
paradise of curiosities and freaks. But great as are 
the attractions of this babel of foreign languages of 
the uncivilized and semicivilized races, we must 
resist the temptation, and try to get possession of 
some clew which will lead us through this many- 
chambered labyrinth of knowledge. 
We must determine, therefore, beforehand, the 
principles upon which we propose to make the selec- 
tion of a few leading topics. 
1. Starting with Europe as the source of all 
modern exploration, migration, and conquest, we may 
study and interpret large portions of Asia, Africa, 
and other outlying portions of the world, from the
-P-A-G-E-104
    92 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
standpoint of the European nations which possessed 
themselves of these lands, and in many cases still 
govern them. This point of view also opens up the 
great traffic routes by land and sea, by which the 
products of these countries are interchanged with 
those of Europeand North America. We can hardly 
get a better introduction to the people of India than 
through an account of the British occupation and 
present administration of Indian affairs. Likewise, 
the story of the Dutch conquest of Java, and their 
management of its people and resources, will give 
us some true notion of the value of this “ Pearl of 
the East” and of the neighboring islands under 
Dutch sway. The best parts of Africa and South 
America, the whole of Australia and New Zealand, 
admit of the best approach and interpretation in the 
same way. 
Some may object to this effort to project European 
ideas and standards upon the other native races of 
the world, but the very contrasts which are brought 
to light by the presence of these European standards 
are what enable us to understand them better. There 
is not the slightest doubt that the world is being 
Europeanized or Americanized as fast as circum- 
stances permit, and the movement is a rapid one. 
From the standpoint of commerce, of all forms of 
industrial life and government, European stand- 
ards must remain the basis of judgment. Even the 
nominally independent empires of China and Japan
-P-A-G-E-105
  
EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY 93 
are now completely in the whirl of European poli- 
tics and at the mercy of commercial influences 
which centre in London, Paris, Hamburg, and New 
York. 
2. It is not possible to treat any of these proposed 
topics without constant reference to important physi- 
ographic facts and principles. On the whole, it is 
better to meet these physiographic facts in imme- 
diate relation to men’s necessities than to study them 
systematically in a separate category. And yet, be- 
fore completing the work of this year a number of 
topics of pronounced physiographic character should 
be completely traversed. For example, the great 
deserts through Asia and Africa should be described 
and explained in their relation to mountain ranges, 
oceans, and ocean winds. The physical structure of 
the great mountain masses of Asia should be ex- 
amined in their relation to India and to the rivers 
and plains of the South, and to the deserts and vast 
plains to the north. The same should be done with 
the relief of Africa, South America, and Australia, 
and the points of resemblance and contrast in the 
great continental masses noted. The equatorial 
regions of the Amazon, the Congo, and the East 
Indies should be studied and compared with one 
another, and the causes of the marked climatic 
conditions understood. The relation of these physi- 
cal facts to man, to the density and distribution of 
population, to the vigor and intelligence of the  
-P-A-G-E-106
    94 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
people, to commerce and production, forms a neces- 
sary part of the treatment. 
In the latter part of the eighth grade, a strong 
emphasis should be given to those broad concepts of 
physiography, for which the illustrative material has 
been collecting all through the grades. For example, 
a study of the equatorial and counter currents in the 
Pacific Ocean, a comparison of them with those of 
the Atlantic and Indian oceans, and the effect of these 
upon the climate, the homes and activities of men 
upon the surrounding continents and oceans would 
organize a great body of geographical facts. 
It is toward the close of the common school course, 
when the children’s power of thought has grown 
stronger, and when the data upon which conclusions 
can be based have been collected, that these larger 
generalizations should be worked out. The mature 
and well-furnished mind of the teacher, seeing the 
powerful influence of these great physiographic laws, 
is inclined to preface the elementary geographic in- 
struction with them. But younger children are not 
ready for physiography in its scientific form. The 
tendency to force a scientific point of view prema- 
turely upon the minds of children is well illustrated 
by the place assigned in the grades to mathematical 
geography. A few years ago it was taught chiefly in 
the fourth grade or even earlier, at the very entrance 
to geographical studies, but now we are postponing 
it as far as possible, even to the sixth grade.
-P-A-G-E-107
  
EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY 95 
If we will but read one of the standard physical 
geographies for high schools and consider how little 
of it can be put within the reasonable comprehension 
of children in the intermediate, and even in grammar 
grades, we will be warned against haste in pushing 
scientific generalizations. 
3. Topics having a strong resemblance to those 
previously studied in Europe or North America will 
require but a brief treatment, and a short compari- 
son should be made. For example, gold and silver 
mining in Australia, Africa, and South America 
require no extended description, as similar topics 
have been fully described elsewhere. But the com- 
parison of results on a large scale is instructive. 
Cotton and wheat production in India, the silk in- 
dustry in China, the agriculture of Australia and 
New Zealand, cattle-raising in South America, and 
the government of smaller colonies require no full 
description. 
On the other hand, the pronounced and character- 
istic topics in Asia and the Southern continents de- 
serve an elaborate presentation and study. Such 
subjects as tea culture in China and Japan, the gov- 
ernment of India, the Island of Java under Dutch 
rule, the Nile River, the Congo and the Amazon, 
the character of the Chinese people, the desert of 
Sahara, coffee plantations in Brazil, the progressive 
quality of the Japanese people, Russia’s Siberian 
railway and relation to China, England, etc., the 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  96 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
Himalaya and Andes mountains,—these are de 
serving of full consideration. 
We will add a few suggestions in regard to the mode 
of teaching and studying topics in the eighth grade. 
The plan of review by comparison should still re- 
main in fullforce. The rivers, mountains, cities, prod- 
ucts, and people of these Oriental and Southern lands 
should be systematically compared with those of North 
America and Europe, already familiar to us. To learn 
that Java is not as large as Illinois, and has twenty- 
five millions of people, will help us to understand how 
productive and well tilled that island must be. The 
comparison of Japan and New Zealand with the Brit- 
ish Isles in size, population, and importance is very 
instructive. 
On account of the marked climatic differences be- 
tween the Northern Hemisphere and the equatorial 
lands, the most striking contrasts are brought out by 
comparison. If the whole Mississippi Valley be com- 
pared with the basin of the Amazon, the wide differ- 
ence between temperate and torrid plains is displayed: 
one an impenetrable forest, wild and largely uninhab- 
ited, the other cultivated and everywhere habitable, 
with scores of cities and a thrifty, intelligent people ; 
the one region flooded with tropical rains, the other 
partly arid and treeless. They have, also, some in- 
teresting points of resemblance. A comparison of 
the Congo with the Amazon shows, also, a striking 
contrast even in equatorial rivers.
-P-A-G-E-109
EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY 97 
The comparisons of Eastern with Western civili: 
zation reveal clearly the advantage of. modern in- 
ventions and scientific progress. The contrast, for 
example, of the slow and burdensome boats and 
shipping, poled along on the Yangtse River in 
China, with our steamboats on the Rhine and 
Hudson, shows a difference of hundreds of years 
in progress. A study of the processes of agricul- 
ture and manufacture by hand in Eastern lands, 
shows how far they have lagged behind Western 
Europe and America in the arts of life. This whole 
year’s work should throw into brilliant light the 
advantages of Western energy, intelligence, and 
scientific progress. Even the savage and barba- 
rous races met in the East Indies and Australia, 
intensify this contrast. The difference between the 
homes and occupations of the Papuans of New 
Guinea and those of Germans and French in 
Europe may lead to fruitful reflection. 
Throughout the seventh grade, the different races 
of the world are easily compared with one another, 
and the characteristic traits, the marks of excellence 
and weakness, are brought into prominence. In the 
seventh grade, a few of the strong nationalities of 
Europe were described. As these more intelligent 
and vigorous races have spread themselves over the 
world, subduing or displacing many of the weaker 
races, opening up trade routes and marts for traffic, 
filling nearly every nook and corner of the world 
H
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
with something of the spirit of modern progress, dis- 
tributing everywhere missionaries, merchants, and 
soldiers, we get some clear notion of the manner 
in which the whole earth is being brought under 
tribute to the needs of man. 
Among other things, we locate the thickly popu- 
lated districts of the world, and see the reasons for 
such concentration in a few spots, while other im- 
mense tracts of land are either uninhabitable deserts 
or impassable tropical jungles. 
One of the greatest lessons of all is to discover how 
every part of the earth is now made to contribute to 
the needs and welfare of every other part, and to see 
with what expenditure of energy, capital, and inge- 
nuity the aggressive races of Europe have built 
canals, opened ocean highways and continental rail- 
road lines. The iced meats of Australia soon find 
their way to London, and refrigerator fruit cars 
cross the continent of North America in a few days. 
These topics lead us close to the present trade 
rivalry of the great powers for the commerce of the 
world, and to the question how the prices of staple 
products are fixed by the world market. 
It is quite evident that the geography of the 
eighth grade brings us to the threshold of a number 
of great sciences, physiography, meteorology, anthro- 
pology, economics, and astronomy. It is not the 
province of geography to set up any one of these 
subjects as a distinct branch of science but to bring
-P-A-G-E-111
EIGHTH-GRADE GEOGRAPHY 93 
together in an interesting and instructive way much 
of the concrete material of these sciences which, in 
the high school and colleges, will be expanded into 
distinct branches of study. Thus, standing at the 
end of the common school course in geography, as 
we survey the whole, a bright illumination is thrown 
upon the aim and scope of the study. The broad, 
simple comprehensiveness of geographical topics 
forbids us from specializing in physiography, geology, 
or any special science. Science, as such, z.¢. system- 
atic classification and order, is naturally a later 
product, not to be prematurely forced upon children. 
In the geography studies of the eighth grade, chil- 
dren are quite able to master the lessons from the 
study of books. They should be thrown as much 
as possible upon their own resources in the study of 
texts, maps, and statistical tables. In the discussion 
of lessons in the class room, the teacher’s skill is 
best shown by questions which test the thinking 
power of the children in tracing physiographic causes 
and in suggesting valuable comparisons with pre- 
vious studies. Children are not much inclined to 
use their previous knowledge by comparison unless 
constantly prompted by a thoughtful teacher. In- 
teresting problems should be placed before the class ; 
for example, Which has the stronger grasp upon 
Asia, England or Russia, and what is likely to be 
the result of their rivalry? What will be the effect 
of the opening of the Isthmian Canal in Central
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
America? In the struggle for a firm footing in 
Africa, which is likely to succeed the better, France 
or England ? 
The free use of geographical readers, books of 
exploration and travel, and physical geographies is to 
be encouraged. The stories of Livingstone, Speke, 
and Stanley in Africa, Clive’s conquests in India as 
told by Macaulay, the stories of the Dutch and Portu- 
guese in the East Indies, and even the narratives 
of Marco Polo furnish the best of sidelights for 
children in these grades. The voyages of Captain 
Cook and the conquest of Peru by Pizarro will add 
a lively interest to certain regions. A number of 
the best commercial geographies will furnish a large 
amount of interesting data for explanation and 
comparison. 
By the close of the eighth grade, there should be 
a few large surveys of the world-whole from dif- 
ferent standpoints, as, for example, the great moun- 
tain systems of the world, the large oceans and their 
movements, the world’s chief traffic routes, the main 
centres of population, climatic conditions as indicated 
by isothermal lines and rainfall, and the political 
and economic preponderance of the great nations.

CHAPTER VII 
METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 
In geography, as in all studies, much depends upon 
the teacher’s method of handling the subject. Even 
a well-selected series of topics with a first-class text- 
book, supported by geographical readers, maps, and 
. pictures, will not insure valuable and instructive 
work. Geography is a very cornucopia of the riches 
of the earth, and the teacher should be an expert in 
the mode of displaying these riches. The first need, 
however, is abundant equipment in knowledge, which 
we presuppose. Familiarity with the leading physio- 
graphic forms and processes is essential and a knowl- 
edge of the history of various lands very helpful. 
The purpose of geography teaching is to awaken 
the mental energies and to enlarge the mental re- 
sources of children through the skilful employment 
of their minds upon this rich material. 
Inthe home geography of the third and fourth grades 
it is obvious that the oral discussion of topics is the 
only feasible method. Even where text-books outline 
and treat these topics, the book-work is only sugges- 
tive. The local excursions must be worked over in the 
101
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
class, map-making explained and practised, and the 
topics suitable to the neighborhood and surrounding 
country elaborated by the teacher. 
In the fifth grade and still more in the sixth, use 
should be made of the text-book. Yet the fuller 
treatment of important type studies is not given in 
the text-books and cannot be. Some of our best text- 
books in geography have selected an excellent series 
of leading topics and outlined briefly the mode of 
their treatment. This leaves, however, much room 
for the teacher to enlarge upon the most essential 
topics, to bring together and discuss much material 
from other sources, to institute comparisons and 
broader surveys. 
Children of the fourth and fifth grades are getting 
their introduction to the larger geography of the 
world. They are learning to think in geographical 
terms. But lessons learned from books are a very 
inadequate means of getting children to image geo- 
graphical things. With or without text-books, the 
oral discussion of topics in the class must arouse the 
children to a keener perception of realities, to that 
sort of knowledge which is gained by him who par- 
ticipates in affairs, and which has upon it the bright 
stamp of reality. If children by the time they have 
finished the chief geographical topics of the United 
States and North America have learned to think 
geography concretely decked out in the complete 
furniture and equipment of real life, all later geog-

® 
raphy of the world will become an open book written 
in familiar characters. It should be the premeditated 
plan of the teacher in earlier geography work to throw 
the children into the midst of men’s active employ- 
ments, and into nature’s varied scenery, and in some 
suggestive way anoint their eyes with the power of 
insight. The various plans and: devices of oral in- 
struction are well calculated to give to lessons this 
intense realism. 
The vital power of instruction is that which is 
given to it by the teacher in the class room. In the 
elementary phases of any study this is surely done 
by oral instruction and not by books. 
Assuming, therefore (in connection with the use of 
books), that skilful oral discussion and treatment of 
topics in intermediate grades is a fundamental need 
of teachers, we will discuss at some length the merits 
of oral work. Consider for a moment the sort of 
topics which we wish children of the fifth grade to 
master, — the lumbering business along the Northern 
rivers and lakes, a trip down the Mississippi River 
from the source to the mouth, the process of sinking 
and operating a coal shaft, with a description of the 
coal fields and marts, cattle-raising on the plains, and 
the cattle trade, shipment, etc. 
A clear, printed description of any one of these 
topics would not be easily comprehended by fifth- 
grade children, while an oral presentation and discus- 
sion in class would be interesting, instructive, and
-P-A-G-E-116
104 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
easily comprehensible. Children of the fifth grade can 
read, but they cannot put the sharper interpretation 
into what they read. They must first learn to think 
geography concretely before they can interpret books 
intelligently. In this lies the whole significance of 
oral instruction in the early stages of any study. 
The method of treating types in class-room instruc- 
tion is discussed more fully in the book on “ Method 
of the Recitation,” but its particular application to 
the elementary geography will be in place in closing 
up our discussion of special method in this subject. 
Our plan of work for third and fourth grades, as 
suggested in the foregoing pages, is essentially a 
method for oral instruction. This is necessarily so in 
the home geography of the third grade, and is equally 
involved in our type studies of the fourth and fifth 
grades. What method of instruction, for example, 
should be adopted in the fourth grade so that children 
may get aclear and adequate understanding of a coal 
mine, or of Lake Superior, or of the lower Mississippi? 
We are not in favor of putting a book in the hands of 
children at this age, although the maps, pictures, and 
printed matter in a good book may be helpful. The 
teacher is more important in such work than any text- 
book. Let him handle and present and discuss the 
subject with the children. This involves a good share 
of the art of teaching. It implies a mastery of the 
subject, an understanding of the children, and a prac- 
tical acquaintance with the technique of instruction,
-P-A-G-E-117
  METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 105 
such as discipline, narrative power, graphic representa. 
tion on blackboard, thoroughness, and drill. The effort 
to acquire skill in this kind of oral treatment and discus- 
sion of topics is well worthy the ambition of earnest 
teachers. It is not a thing of easy attainment, and 
yet, if successful, it gives uncommon zest and spirit to 
the teacher’s work. We will attempt to indicate some 
of the imperatives which the teacher must lay upon 
himself if he seeks success along this line of effort. 
We may remark in passing that many teachers are 
inclined to look upon all definite requirements as 
limitations to their freedom and individuality. But 
thoughtful teachers are seeking for definite channels 
along which to work out their freedom and individ- 
uality. They are even willing to submit to laws 
if they lead to success and to a better regulated 
activity. : 
In connection with skill in oral teaching we submit 
the following points. 
1. A complete mastery of the lesson is required of 
one who will teach well orally. No mere reading 
over the lesson will give a good preparation. It must 
be analyzed into its essentials and grasped in its rela- 
tions. A verbal memory of the facts will not answer; 
and the more one comprehends the fundamental no- 
tions of his science and possesses great fertility in 
illustration, the better. Mere method will do a 
_ teacher no good unless he has a full knowledge of the 
principles and facts of the geography topic. Scholarly  
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
people are accustomed to demand of the teacher that 
he shall thoroughly know his lesson. We must goa 
step farther than this and say that he must knowit still 
better than that. To know a lesson for teaching pur- 
poses is not only to know its facts and to grasp them 
clearly in their scientific connection as well-organ- 
ized material, but it is also to know how the children 
best approach and master the subject and how to 
guide them inthe process. This is, for young teachers, 
at least, a more difficult thing than the mere mastery 
of a science. It involves skill in the use of simple 
language which the children can understand and 
familiarity with the children’s previous experience 
and store of knowledge, also skill in illustrative device 
and in apt questioning, — things gained only by severe 
forethought and effort. 
For example, the preparation of a lesson on the 
construction of the jetties at the mouth of the Mis- 
sissippi, for the purpose of teaching it orally, requires 
a thoroughness of survey of leading points and an 
accuracy of detail, with an adaptation to children, which 
is much beyond the requirements of vigorous teachers 
in the usual mastery of lessons. The absolute clear- 
ness of thought, simplicity of language, and aptness 
of illustrative sketch or diagram greatly exceed the 
demands of ordinary lessons from students. 
2. Efforts at oral teaching more than anything else 
lead the teacher to see the unmistakable need of well- 
chosen object-lessons and illustrations, of what we 
 
-P-A-G-E-119
METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 109 
usually call the concrete phases of the subject. By 
confining the children to the text-book and to memo- 
rizing its statements, the young teacher can easily 
deceive himself with the idea that children are learn- 
ing and understanding. But any lack of interest and 
attention in oral work shows the teacher at once that 
his words are not understood, that explanations, ex- 
amples, and abundance of concrete material are indis- 
pensable. The oral teacher drops, therefore, into a 
much more graphic, illustrative, concrete style of teach- 
ing, and this is undoubtedly better adapted to the 
minds of children in primary and intermediate grades. 
It is observable with good oral teachers that their 
whole style of thought and conversation becomes 
tinged with the objective, realistic mode of interpre- 
tation. When they talk to children their language is 
couched in figures of speech, images, and objective 
examples from common life. 
3. To store the mind with a rich assortment of 
experiences and dealings with objective things is 
singularly valuable to elementary teachers. Just be- 
yond the narrow range of the average observation, 
and yet within our own home and neighborhood, is an 
abundant store of what are called common objects and 
activities which yet elude the common observation. 
The ordinary ignorance of plants, flowers, and animals 
is proverbial, but it is equally great with regard to the 
common employments, products, and processes of in- 
dustrial life. The home geography of the third and 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
108 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
fourth grades, which deals with these very common 
things of which people are commonly ignorant, turns 
up this soil which lies at the root of the educational 
tree. Our naturalists, novelists, and poets, by their 
loving absorption and joy in these common things, 
teach us where to look for the simple beginnings and 
deep sources of wisdom. But schoolmasters, by a 
curious fatality, turn to those artificial cisterns called 
text-books. Sometimes they are empty for lack of 
rain. The teacher’s mind needs to gush up like a 
spring from the midst of mosses, stones, trees, birds, 
and flowers, or like a fountain in the midst of the busy 
activities of the street and the shop. 
4. The ability to form clear-cut images of these 
various objects and processes is a peculiar trait of the 
teacher. What the teacher bodies forth in distinct 
outlines in his own mind, he can the better explain to 
the children. After reading a description of a coal 
mine — shaft, tunnels, chambers, and plan of ventila- 
tion—the teacher should ask himself, Can I close 
my eyes and picture to myself the whole mine in op- 
eration? Can I project the simple plan of the whole, 
as it were, at a glance, as if the earth walls were 
transparent? If I am unable to do this, I cannot 
present it to children. I may multiply words (darken 
counsel with speech), I may even tell many interest- 
ing facts, but the whole thing remains a blur, both to 
teacher and children, unless that one bright flash has 
illuminated the whole picture with intelligence.
-P-A-G-E-121
  
METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 109 
In picturing to myself the history of a volcanic 
mountain, such as Mount Shasta, unless I can throw 
into a connected series the succession of explosions 
and lava flows by which the shingly sides of the 
mountain were built up, and later the ages of storm, 
snow, glacier, and gushing torrents by which it has 
been torn down, I can give no intelligible account of 
the whole to children. 
After going through a shoe-factory and noticing a 
multitude of interesting details, unless I can sit down 
and bring into one connected series the various work 
of the different operatives and thus image at a glance 
the chief steps of the whole process of shoemaking 
from start to finish, I cannot make a successful excur- 
sion with children to such a factory. 
Geography everywhere, in dealing with the works 
of nature and man, calls into play this powerful hu- 
man faculty of imaging. There is scarcely an im- 
portant lesson in geography where the teacher does 
not find himself fronted by such a problem, calling 
for the splendid constructive power of imagination. 
It is just barely possible that a student may get 
through the high school and college with a mini- 
mum use of this imaging power, if he chances ts’ 
have a good verbal memory and fluency of speech, 
combined with indulgence on the part of instruc- 
tors. But from a fund of knowledge thus ac- 
quired he can never teach school. His tools are too 
blunt. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
5. It is in this connection that the use of the 
blackboard by the teacher for sketches and dia- 
grams, crude picturing, etc., becomes a source of 
power. In all such cases the whole energy and 
skill of the teacher are expended in stimulating 
the imaging power of the children. The black- 
board is the best means of simple and sharp delin- 
eation. In explaining the workings of a canal-lock, 
a few simple lines on the board can do more than 
a multitude of words to suggest the correct image. 
In showing the recession of the falls at Niagara 
and at Minneapolis, a half-minute’s board-sketching 
is worth much more than a page of verbal descrip- 
tion. In exhibiting the depth of sea beds and 
relative heights of mountains, board-sketching is 
a short cut to the point. In almost every topic 
sketching is required. In showing plans of irrigation, 
the sinking of shafts and running of tunnels in gold, 
iron, and coal mines; in explaining many processes 
in mills, factories, lumber-camps, and ship construc- 
tion; in the ground-plans of great churches and 
public buildings; in showing the action of streams 
in forming river valleys, the position and effects of 
glaciers, the contour of land-forms, as plains, moun- 
tains, and plateaus, —the teacher’s use of the black- 
board is an indispensable means of economy and skill 
in instruction. The teacher who cannot use the 
blackboard freely for illustrative purposes is shorn of 
half his strength at the start.
-P-A-G-E-123
  METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY Ili 
Map-drawing and construction for children will be 
treated later. 
6. Yet the chief means of getting geography topics 
before the children is that by oral description. Sim- 
plicity and clearness of language are needed and a 
lively, interesting manner. Teachers who are con- 
stantly with children soon learn to avoid words and 
phrases which they cannot understand. Showy 
phraseology, vague and high-sounding words, are no 
part of a teacher’s outfit in skilful, oral instruction. 
A very plain and lucid style of speech, which any one 
can cultivate, is the chief requirement. Words and 
phrases that are striking and picturesque, common 
and homely figures of speech, and original apt turns 
of expression should be cultivated by the teacher with 
the greatest care. Choice language should be a dis- 
tinguishing characteristic of a teacher, and at no point 
does it come better into play than in these oral les- 
sons. Yet stiff or stilted language is out of place. 
Freedom, good-fellowship, and humor, a ready inter- 
change of question and answer, and the full use of ges- 
ture and manner to give clearness to thought are most 
desirable. ‘ 
Besides the usual intercourse of life the more care- 
ful study of the best story-tellers, novelists, poets, and 
scientific writers is the best direct means of acquiring 
this language power. 
7. Each topic or type should be grasped as a whole. 
The type idea whichthe particular illustration exempli-
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
fies should stand out clearly in mind. This require 
ment is a preliminary and preparation for good teaching 
rather than a part of it. The type idea may not come 
out at all for awhile in the instruction of the children, 
but it stands in the background of the teacher’s mind 
all the while, and regulates his progress. This central 
idea or line of thought is the pivot upon which the 
whole discussion hinges. It gives the teacher a true 
perspective in the treatment of his subject, it tells how 
much or how little detail is needed in special topics, 
and how far it is safe to trace the relations to other 
subjects and into other studies. In short, the type 
idea gives the teacher a safe centre of operations. 
Each topic or subordinate part of the larger whole 
should stand out clear and sharp. Its distinctness 
should not be blurred by its close relation to other 
topics. The whole series of related topics, constitut- 
ing a larger whole, should be worked out beforehand 
by the teacher and afterwards with the children, so that 
they not only master the ideas but fall into logical 
habits of thinking and learning. 
We deem it well for both teacher and taught to pre- 
serve a neat copy of this outline of topics from day to 
day through the year. It is a standing proof of sys- 
tematic and careful progress and a good basis for 
reviews. It will be serviceable in language composi- 
tions, and the outlines of other oral recitations in lit. 
erature or history, in natural science and in language, 
may be neatly preserved in the same book.
-P-A-G-E-125
    
METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 113 
This clear and definite outline of essential points 
may be placed on the board step by step in the prog- 
ress of the recitation. To achieve this result is diffi- 
cult, but is worth all the effort that may be expended 
upon it. 
Fortunately, many of the large type studies chosen 
from North America and Europe contain within them- 
selves a very strong and necessary natural sequence. 
Lumbering on the upper Mississippi should begin 
with the pineries and logging-camps and proceed to 
skidding, floating the rafts down the river, the saw- 
mills, and distribution of lumber by rail to the prairie 
regions. This is also the actual order in which the 
work is conducted. The description of an irrigating 
ditch in the West involves the following necessary 
order: the building of the dam, the construction of 
the ditch, the reservoirs, the letting of water upon 
the fields, the crops raised by irrigation, dangers of 
floods, water rights, and the settlement of disputes, 
the market for farm and garden products raised by 
irrigation. Many other illustrations might be given 
from physiographic, agricultural, commercial, and 
manufacturing topics, showing this strong, natural se- 
quence in the leading divisions of a subject. 
8. This brings us to the important question of 
_ tracing cause and effect and the solution of problems 
in geography which was treated at considerable length 
in the chapter on Method in the “ Special Method in 
History.” A powerful, causal sequence runs through 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-126
  JI4 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
many geographical topics, and it is a source of the 
strongest interest and intellectual effort to trace out 
this connection of cause and effect through the whole 
series of steps in a large lesson. In the sugar-beet 
industry, for example, we have a series of steps in- 
volving the raising of beets on the farm (agriculture), 
the processes of extracting the juices, slicing, steam- 
ing, diffusion, evaporation, crystallization, the complex 
process of refining (manufacture), the shipment and 
sale of the product and its final uses (commerce), which 
involves the adapting of means to ends at every step. 
In approaching almost every stage in this causal 
sequence we can halt the class and call upon them to 
solve the difficulty which is presented at this juncture. 
How can the juice be extracted from the beets, which 
is to be boiled down later? In raising sugar-beets 
how may beets be secured which will produce the 
largest percentage of sugar? Is sugar obtained from 
sugar-cane by the same process as from beets? Even 
when the problem or question can only be partly an- 
swered it suggests a keen inquiry into the causes and 
reasons. There are scores and scores of places in good 
geography lessons where children should be allowed a 
moment, or if need be an hour or a day, to work out 
the solution of a problem. One peculiar advantage of 
this problem-setting is that pupils are brought face to 
face with precisely the same problems which confront 
the scientist, the agriculturist, the manufacturer, the 
merchant. They are dealing with the realities of life  
-P-A-G-E-127
  
METHOD IN TEACHING GEOGRAPHY 115 
in the same form in which they appear to people out- 
side of school. 
It is quite plain that to solve problems in geogra 
phy is to make it to that extent an oral study. It is 
doubtful if text-books in geography can ever make 
much headway in offering problems for solution 
(although the questions at the end of chapters can do 
something in this direction). Their chief function is 
to state the facts and conclusions or answers to prob- 
lems. 
The teacher, in the midst of the oral presentation 
and discussion of topics, can frequently bring them to 
the attack of plain and definite problems, and the oral 
discussion may be used as a means to intensify the 
struggle with these problems. 
g. Oral instruction which involves free discussion, 
question, and answer, etc., is difficult to manage. It is 
apt to run to waste and to end in loose, incoherent 
work. The solution to all these difficulties seems to 
lie in the thoroughness with which the simple, funda- 
mental line of thought, or succession of topics, has 
been worked out, and in the fidelity with which the 
essential topics are kept clearly in mind. The art of 
skilful questioning depends largely upon finding the 
pivotal question in any important topic,—the one 
which brings its main problem clearly to the front. 
10. It is one thing for the teacher to do his duty 
in oral lessons and another to get children to do 
theirs. In good, oral teaching at least half the burden
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
of work must be carried by the children. This 
again calls for a variety of skill and device. In the 
midst of the presentation and discussion of a topic 
children need to be pointedly and skilfully questioned 
from time to time, soas to be thrown back upon their 
own resources, to make use of previous experience, 
and to think and judge correctly. Such questions 
force children to self-activity and original thought. 
When a topic has been properly presented and dis- 
cussed, it falls to the children to reproduce it with rea- 
sonable fulness and accuracy. In this respect it is 
the teacher’s function to hold the children to a strict 
performance of duty, else oral instruction will degen- 
erate. When the children find that this requirement 
is unavoidable and sure, they will be prepared for the 
effort. It will also take away from the teacher the 
danger of talking too much. In oral instruction, class 
attention is almost an absolute requirement. Not 
only is a strong control desirable, but close watchful- 
ness to detect inattention, readiness to throw out a 
question or hint to call back the wandering thought. 
Variety of tests may also be employed, brief, written 
tests, board-work, map-drawing, as well as oral re- 
production.  
-P-A-G-E-129
CHAPTER VIII 
CORRELATION OF GEOGRAPHY WITH OTHER STUDIES 
On account of the complex nature of geography, it 
being made up of materials derived from many 
sources, its connections with other studies are numer- 
ous and close. As compared with other studies it 
seems to be the most companionable of them all, there 
being scarcely an offshoot of knowledge that does 
not find shelter under the broad wings of geography. 
In some of the principal schemes for correlating 
studies, geography has been regarded as the mother 
study, the one which would naturally be the centre in 
any plan of concentration. We will first inquire into 
the number and character of these relations which 
geography bears to the different studies. 
The natural sciences are usually thought of, not 
only as having many intimate relations to geography, 
but as actually furnishing a large part of the warp and 
woof of geography. The minerals, vegetables, ani- 
mals, and all the physical objects and phenomena of 
earth, air, and water which make up the peculiar 
realm of natural science supply also the subject-mat- 
ter of geography. Geography deals with all these 
117 
 
-P-A-G-E-130
118 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
things from a peculiar standpoint which we call the 
geographical, but they are the same materials which 
the various natural sciences deal with, each from its 
own point of view. Geography, therefore, is very 
close kin to the biological and physical sciences, and 
has some of their blood in its veins. Close, however, 
as these relations are they do not obliterate the lines 
between studies. The same object may be handled 
by two or more separate sciences. The white pine 
may be the subject of one or more pure science les- 
sons or it may be described as the chief lumber-pro- 
ducing tree in the great pine forests of the North, —a 
geographical topic. 
In this manner geography reaches out into all the 
fields of natural science and lays hold of objects which 
it uses for its own purposes; for example, stratified 
sandstone, granite quarries, volcanoes, salt beds, coal 
strata, iron mines, tropical forests, river valleys, the 
sheep, the cow, the camel, the sugar-cane, the silk- 
worm, the ocean currents and tides, the winds and 
rains, the salmon, cod, and whale, the plateaus and 
mountains, the orange and apple, the wheat and rice, 
the wild fruits and animals, and hundreds more of 
objects from the realm of nature. 
It may be observed that wherever geography selects 
an object from any one of the sciences, she turns it 
into some channel of direct utility to man. Whether 
for weal or for woe, geography is an intensely utilita- 
rian study. Rivers which are useful to man for naviga-
-P-A-G-E-131
  CORRELATION WITH OTHER STUDIES 11g 
tion, for water-power or for recreation or scenery are 
favorites with geography ; forests which supply lum- 
ber, bays full of oysters, mountains veined with gold, 
plains yielding heavy crops, winds and currents which 
help or hinder the sailor, are of great geographical 
importance. 
Any scientific object which does not contribute 
directly to man’s luxuries or necessities receives a 
cold shoulder from geography. Geography does not 
often throw much light upon purely scientific objects 
or inventions, but she is proudand liberal in showing 
their utilities. Geography would never explain the 
principle of the steam-engine, or the safety-lamp, but 
would show how indispensable they are in manufac- 
ture and mining. 
Geography, therefore, is extremely useful in show- 
ing everywhere those points of contact where man 
has gotten the better of nature and has used her 
resources. 
Geography and history also stand in very close com- 
panionship. Historians have often emphasized the 
fact that geography is indispensable to history, as it 
were, one of the legs on which history stands. On the 
other hand, geography is greatly indebted to history 
for the interest which attaches to many of its impor- 
tant topics. Scotland, Egypt, Italy, and Greece would 
not attract us greatly but for their historic interest. 
So completely is history everywhere environed and 
conditioned by geography that we are inclined to
-P-A-G-E-132
120 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
believe that if all the biographical stories and history 
studies of the children were treated with full regard 
to their geographic setting, children would have, 
without further study, a tolerably complete political 
and local geography. Many of the early history 
stories give a most graphic and realistic description 
of the topography and climate of the important parts 
of our own country and of other lands, oceans, and 
hemispheres. So mutually helpful and illuminating 
is this light thrown upon each other’s work by history 
and geography in several grades of our common 
school course, that we have laid out these studies on 
parallel lines. For example, the geography topics of 
the United States are paralleled by history topics for 
the same year, treating the same regions of country, 
and likewise with Europe and other lands to some 
extent. 
An examination of our whole course of study in 
geography will show that historical considerations 
have largely shaped it, first America fully treated, 
then the movement toward Europe with an elaborate 
study of its large topics, and later the journey out- 
ward from Europe to the rest of the world. 
Geography, as it seems, more than any other study, 
makes a free and liberal use of all possible modes of 
expressing its ideas, whether by oral and written lan- 
guage, drawing of maps, diagrams, and pictures, or by 
manual constructions involving those simple objects 
and processes which geography is most interested in. 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
CORRELATION WITH OTHER STUDIES 121 
In the geography lesson children have as good an 
opportunity for exercising their powers over the 
English language as in a reading or language lesson ; 
they often do as much drawing as in a drawing period ; 
they work out the construction of a canal-lock, a 
loom, or a mill-race and wheel, as in a series of man- 
ual-training lessons. In recent years there has been 
a great development of these expressive phases of 
geography. They lead to a much greater clearness 
and mastery of geographical concepts. 
On the other hand, it is a notable discovery to find 
that drawing is not an isolated art but is indispen- 
sable as a means of better grasping and expressing 
another subject. 
Geography tests all other subjects in the school 
course as to their value, and asks bluntly, “ What 
help can you render us in geography?” Here, again, 
geography descends to the purely practical, and forces 
the question of direct utility. 
When we consider how much teachers of special sub- 
jects, like drawing and arithmetic, are inclined to build 
a wall around each specialty and hedge it in against 
outsiders and thus create a cosy nook where they 
may be secure from outside intrusion, what shall we 
say about geography, which goes leaping over all 
fences, disregarding all privacy, and laying every field 
and grove and garden under contribution? Geogra- 
phy is an obtrusively democratic, utilitarian sort of 
study. Itis a kind of disagreeable upstart, popping up
-P-A-G-E-134
122 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
in all the most inconvenient places among the prescrip. 
tions and aristocracies of studies, and, with an air of 
equality, says to its neat, well-dressed companions, 
“Roll up your sleeves, come here and give me a lift. 
I wish you to help pump muddy water out of a coal 
mine, to find a good fertilizer for a sandy field, to ex- 
tract sugar out of beet-roots, to build a railroad to the 
top of Mount Washington, to sketch me a view of a 
scene from the top of the mountain.” 
How disagreeable this rude familiarity is to the 
refined patrician taste of drawing and literature, of 
arithmetic and grammar, can hardly be expressed in 
polite language. Can it be surprising that the word 
“correlation” has become a word of evil omen? 
Arithmetic has managed thus far to stand aloof 
from these modern troubles and confusions and to 
maintain its own independent race-course for the train- 
ing of athletes. But the clock has already struck 
the fatal hour for independent, isolated arithmetic. 
Nearly every important topic in geography needs 
to be analyzed and illuminated from the quantitative 
point of view. In the study of the grocery business 
in third or fourth grade we must measure various 
products with the standard gallon, pound, bushel, 
barrel, foot, and dollar. To understand a few of the 
main risks and chances in the grocery business in 
any sort of a practical way, we must apply these 
standards to an interesting variety of simple arith- 
metical problems. A good share of arithmetic
-P-A-G-E-135
  CORRELATION WITH OTHER STUDIES 123 
could be taught in a grocery store, in the natural 
order, without hunting out conundrums. 
In dealing later with the subject of irrigation, in 
measuring distances, slopes, excavations, the flow of 
water, the acreage and the quantity and value of 
crops, the standard units of measure are used at 
every step. The arithmetical problems marked out 
illuminate the whole topic from the quantitative point 
of view. The same is true of all topics in agriculture, 
mining, manufacturing, and commerce. 
In dealing with rivers, plateaus, mountains, and all 
physiographic processes, there is no clear understand- 
ing without applying definitely these arithmetical, 
quantitative standards. There is no new discovery 
in all this. It has long been known that arithmetical 
standards underlie all the work in the natural sciences, 
in industrial occupations, and in geographical forms. 
Arithmetic also has drawn a multitude of practical 
problems, so called, from all these sources. None the 
less, geography has not been correlated with arithmetic. 
Teachers have not set to work to illuminate geographi- 
cal topics from the quantitative point of view. To 
use arithmetic systematically as an instrument for 
clearing up complex geographical notions would tear 
down most of the fences between geography and 
arithmetic. Arithmetic must come down into the 
plain from its castle on the height to grind corn, dig 
canals, build houses, hoist the coal, drive the engines, 
and look after the factories, shops, fields, and mines.
-P-A-G-E-136
124 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
In this discussion of correlation we find that geog: 
raphy has her finger in every pie, that there is 
scarcely a fact or principle in the whole range of 
studies which geography may not feel free to appro- 
priate to its own uses. 
What advantage has correlation to offer to make 
up for all this irritation, to say nothing of the con- 
fused and fenceless condition in which it seems to 
leave the studies of the school course ? 
Let it be observed first of all that geography, more 
than other studies, has domiciled itself among men 
in the midst of their homes and usual occupations. 
It walks directly into the market-places, homes, 
factories, mines, and fields where men are at work. 
It observes, studies, and sympathizes with the labors, 
amusements, and hardships of the people as they are 
beset by climate and physical surroundings. Deal- 
ing thus with the actual conditions of life, it sees 
the true and necessary relations in which different 
departments of knowledge stand to one another. It 
finds that things widely separated in the studies of 
the schools are closely jostled together in life. The 
sciences, music, mathematics, language, reading, and 
history are all threads woven together into one fabric 
which is constantly poured forth from the roaring 
loom of life. 
This intense interplay of the different active forms 
of knowledge in the conflict of life is the foundation 
of all correlation, The causal connection between 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  CORRELATION WITH OTHER STUDIES 125 
different kinds of knowledge, the absolute depend- 
ence of geography upon geology, history, and lan- 
guage, and other studies, as revealed in practical life, 
has forced geography into this emphasis of the 
relations between studies. Arithmetic, language, 
drawing, and natural science are actually present and 
noticeably influential in every lesson in geography. 
No topic can be understood except by tracing out 
these causal relations between studies. No good 
thinking, no real insight into the world as it is, can 
be attained except by knowing these correlations. 
Geography, therefore, is doing nothing more than 
recalling us to our senses, teaching us that we have 
wandered from the track in giving such extreme 
isolation to the separate studies. 
It is, however, not so difficult to give strong rea- 
sons in favor of a closer correlation of geography with 
other studies as to work out a feasible plan for its 
accomplishment. 
The difficulties in such a plan, and in overcoming 
them, we will attempt briefly to point out. 
1. A course of study in geography must be worked 
out which contains a well-selected series of great units 
of study, involving all the essential phases of geog- 
raphy. Each of these units becomes the centre for 
a full treatment of a topic involving its correlations 
with other studies. 
2. The topics of study in geography, history, natural 
science, and other studies must be run parallel to one  
-P-A-G-E-138
ee ry ee nr ete era ne CM snr ates ate eee 
126 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
another, so as to meet the needs of children and to 
allow of a natural and many-sided correlation between 
the studies. As yet, courses of study have not been 
laid out with much regard to these frequent inter- 
changes, courtesies, and necessary connections be- 
tween different studies. When these preliminary 
conditions have been satisfied and we are supplied 
with a well-arranged course of studies along all lines, 
the teachers who work out this plan to its comple- 
tion have special trials. 
3. There is danger of confusing and mixing studies. 
In stepping across the boundary into any related 
branch, there is peril of losing the connection with 
the fundamental line of thought in the first study. 
Experience has shown that this danger is a real one 
and that even good teachers get on to side tracks. In 
geography, especially, it is easy to become so interested 
in the science or history topics suggested by a geog- 
raphy lesson as to spend too much time upon those 
related topics. In such cases, it is necessary for the 
teacher to hold clearly in mind the central idea of the 
geography lesson and to make use of the related sci- 
ence or history only so far as they directly illuminate 
the geography. The moment the teacher allows him- 
self to shift the centre of thought to the related science 
or history topic he is lost. Good teaching requires, 
therefore, great clearness and well-balanced judgment. 
4. In order to correlate studies successfully, 
teachers must be well posted on nearly the whole
-P-A-G-E-139
CORRELATION WITH OTHER STUDIES 127 
course of study, including not only the different 
branches in any one grade and their relations to one 
another but also the same for one or two grades pre- 
ceding and following. 
The wide range of the correlations of geography 
with nearly all the studies of the school course has 
been fully pointed out. The general character and 
value of these correlations need to be well understood, 
though the teacher cannot well be an expert in all 
the related subjects. It may be safely said that every 
teacher should be well equipped both in the knowl- 
edge and in the application of the principles of 
method throughout the whole course. These are 
broad demands, but it is difficult to see how children 
can be well taught by teachers of less breadth and 
detailed knowledge.
-P-A-G-E-140
CHAPTER IX 
INCIDENTAL TEACHING 
In geography study there is a tendency to spread 
abroad over a great field of subjects, and, what is 
worse, to give emphasis to second or third rate mat- 
ters, to minor and incidental objects, which should be 
made wholly tributary to the large points of view. 
_ Unfortunately, schoolmasters, in spite of the best 
intentions, drift into a number of favorite exercises 
of a strictly formal pattern and of a wholly secondary 
value. Such a statement as this needs to be abun- 
dantly illustrated and clearly proven rather than 
thrown at teachers as an offensive criticism. We will 
take some pains, therefore, to specify and explain our 
standpoint. : 
It is well known among all that a great deal of the 
time of children in both study periods and recitations 
is spent in merely naming and locating places, in 
telling boundaries, in pointing out the cardinal points 
and intermediate directions of the compass (in early 
work), in naming catalogues of products for states, in 
printed map questions, and in strict formal reviews of 
these same things. In the eyes of most teachers this 
128 
 
-P-A-G-E-141
INCIDENTAL TEACHING 129 
will not seem a serious charge because by far the 
greater part of their work, as planned in the text- 
books, is of this character. 
We are willing to go on record with the statement 
that these are in no respect the main things in geog- 
raphy. At the same time we claim no originality 
for the statement nor for the idea that underlies it. 
Geography is nota set of drills any more than theology 
is a set of rules for ceremonial devotion. No amount 
of strenuous assertion on the part of schoolmasters 
that these things are absolutely necessary and that the 
discipline secured is excellent can lift them from a 
wholly secondary to the chief place in geography. 
Quite an amount of machinery and technique are 
necessary for teaching geography well, but we are not 
willing to sink the whole subject to the machine 
level and to forget that certain ideas of superior 
quality and strength are what give motive power to 
all the machinery ; in other words, that geography is 
primarily a study of certain ideas and interesting 
questions of men’s relations to the earth upon which 
they live and to one another. 
But in taking up this position we find ourselves 
flanked by a strong battalion of prominent writers on 
geography and even scientific geographers who insist, 
for example, that the earliest lessons in geography 
should be sharp and repeated drills in fixing the points 
of the compass, and in early exercises in accurate 
map-making, beginning, of course, with the school 
K
-P-A-G-E-142
130 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
grounds. The defence offered for the severely formal 
cut of this early work in geography is that, by a close 
analysis, it gives the children at the start a clear grasp 
of the simple elements upon which all geography is 
based, —the ideas of place, direction, and relative 
position. To fix this important notion of place and 
direction clearly in the minds of children at the very 
beginning, many teachers and writers are willing to 
resort to a systematic drill. This initial drill we claim 
is unnecessary because these same notions are best 
mastered incidentally in connection with topics of 
real interest. 
A few years ago the very first lessons in the little 
primary geographies were given to a simple treatment 
of mathematical geography, based upon this place 
notion as fundamental. But these lessons are now 
abandoned. We do not question the primary value 
of the notions of place, direction, etc., but claim that 
they should always follow in the wake of topics of 
larger human interest. Just before starting out upon 
an excursion to the fruit farm or the blacksmith’s 
shop, let us ask the children the direction of our jour- 
ney and which ways they must take in returning to 
their separate homes. There are dozens of situations 
where the children will need to know the directions, 
and these are by far the best places to teach them. 
As an incident to excursions, map-making, and many 
other topics, place and direction should be frequently 
pointed out; but to waste time in separate lessons on
-P-A-G-E-143
  
INCIDENTAL TEACHING 134 
this subject is one of those pedantries from which 
the schoolmaster finds it hard to break loose. It is 
worth noticing that, in a parallel line of work, in early 
reading many of the old formal drills on alphabets, 
phonic exercises, and repetitions have been dropped 
out by good teachers, the thought being centred upon 
interesting sentences and stories, and the necessary 
forms are mastered as much as possible in an inci- 
dental way. 
And yet the time that may be saved in this manner 
in the primary grades is trifling compared with that 
possible in the higher grades. What quantities of 
time have been wasted in these grades in learning 
and droning over the mere name and location of 
places! As if there were a virtue in this! It might 
be something to know where heaven is but better to 
know the conditions of entrance. 
The importance of the place idea is often illustrated 
by such places as Pittsburg, Chicago, and Minneapolis. 
No better examples, however, could be given to show 
the emptiness of the place idea when taken by itself. 
One hundred years ago the spot where Chicago stands 
occupied the same place relations to the Great Lakes 
and the Mississippi Valley that it does now. The 
things which now make Chicago an interesting object 
of geographical study are the physical and human 
forces at this centre. The place idea has in itself no 
content. Even the deepest of philosophers have had 
difficulty in thinking and explaining it. The main
-P-A-G-E-144
  132 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
point to be considered is that the centre of thought 
and interest is not the place idea but the objects and 
their relation to one another. 
The art of making and interpreting maps has been 
frequently set up as a distinct department of geog- 
raphy. But maps in the common school should be 
used wholly as a means of interpreting and expressing 
knowledge. When an important topic is under con- 
sideration, as the Amazon River, the map should be 
used as a help, an incident. To spend weeks in the 
execution of maps seems to us a mode of abstracting 
the mind from the essential subjects and largely wast- 
ing it upon isolated things. The tasteful and artistic 
execution of maps is a pleasant hobby for the school- 
master and an agreeable and disciplinary entertain- 
ment for many of the pupils, but, when measured 
upon the standard of its real value to the central pur- 
pose of geography study, it is a dilettante perform- 
ance. There are many topics in geography where 
both teacher and pupils should use ready map-sketch- 
ing as a quick and graphic means of explanation. 
Accuracy in small details of coast-lines, river-wind- 
ings, and boundaries are not needed, and momentary 
sketches, correct in general outline and proportion, 
meet every requirement. For such purposes a map 
of North America or New York State or Boston 
can be sketched in less than a minute on the 
blackboard. This makes map-drawing wholly tribu- 
tary to the expression of the thought, little more
-P-A-G-E-145
  
INCIDENTAL TEACHING 133 
than a device incident to the skilful treatment of a 
topic. 
It is, perhaps, still more difficult to convince the 
scientific students of physiography that the materials 
of their chosen science are but contributions to the 
main stream of geography taught in the elementary 
schools. In dealing with the Hudson River, for ex- 
ample, we do not begin with a history of the river 
from the standpoint of physiography but give a de- 
scriptive account of its physical, commercial, scenic, 
and historic points of interest, that is, a sort of pano- 
ramic view of the whole to which physical geography 
contributes some elements. The unit of thought is 
the whole river in its close mingling of physical, 
commercial, and historic characteristics. There is a 
decided advantage in not isolating the physiography of 
the Hudson from its other elements. The closer the 
connection and interdependence between the physio- 
graphic and commercial and other facts, the more 
significant will all the facts become, because each is 
seen in its necessary relation to the others. Physiog- 
raphy, as a science, does not come to light in the 
common school, but its best elements add greatly to 
the meaning and force of all geography topics. They 
have found their proper auxiliary position in geography 
instruction. 
The organizing centres of geographical instruction 
are none of these incidental things (notions of place 
and location, map-making, physiography, etc.) which
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
we have been describing. These centres of thought 
are the geographic types, each of which contains 
some dominant idea. In our course of study we have 
tried to select a series of these great types as the 
real basis of each year’s work. If we can make it 
appear that these type ideas are the real centres for 
organizing the varied facts of geography, we shall be 
able to demonstrate that much of children’s time is 
now wasted in learning catalogues of products, lists 
of names in tracing lessons, the capitals of states, and 
in tedious reviews and repetitions. 
For example, in treating Minneapolis as a trade 
centre for making lumber and flour and shipping 
them (the lumber to the Western prairies, the flour 
to Eastern markets), we have a very striking illustra- 
tion of a trade centre. By comparisons with the 
cities on the upper Mississippi, from Minneapolis to 
St. Louis, we found that Winona, La Crosse, Dubuque, 
Davenport, Clinton, and St. Louis were all centres 
for the lumber and flour trade for very similar reasons 
to those of Minneapolis. In other words, Minneapolis 
is almost a perfect type of all these cities of the upper 
Mississippi. We are surprised a little later that Mil- 
waukee, Chicago, Saginaw, Detroit, Cleveland, Buf- 
falo, Albany, Bangor, and Augusta are centres of 
the lumber business in a manner strikingly similar to 
that of Minneapolis. In some cases lakes, in others 
rivers and canals, serve as means by which logs or 
lumber are brought to these cities and then shipped
-P-A-G-E-147
  
INCIDENTAL TEACHING 135 
by water or by rail to the markets. In all cases 
these cities lie between the forests on one side and a 
large population on the other side, needing and con- 
suming much lumber. 
Notice now that in following out this single line of 
thought, Minneapolis as a type of trade centres in 
lumber, we have located and named all-the larger 
cities and tributaries of the upper Mississippi River 
and have seen a close connection between the great 
forest belt of northern Minnesota and Michigan with 
the rich and boundless prairie region to the west. 
Again we have located all the Great Lakes and their 
chief ports, noticed one of the chief reasons for their 
importance, likewise the cities of Albany, Augusta, 
and Bangor, the Hudson, the Kennebec, and the 
Penobscot. The great forest belt stretching across the 
country from Maine through Canada to northern Min- 
nesota has been located and its important relation to 
the large cities and populations southward explained. 
We cannot take the space to indicate other important 
facts in regard to the climate, resources, canals, traffic 
routes by water and rail, mills and factories which 
are necessarily incidental to the treatment of this 
large topic. 
The main point we wish to illustrate is that a single 
first-class type study, like Minneapolis, tends to or- 
ganize around it a varied and instructive body of facts. 
Not one of these facts but is seen in its necessary 
relation to the others. Such a topic throws a bright 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
’ 
136 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
illumination over a large area of geographic knowledge, 
and shows clearly the relations between the facts. 
All these facts, however, are but incidents in the 
treatment of the main topic. They face about and 
swing into line at the command of a central control- 
ling thought. Would any one claim that it would be 
better to learn and locate all these cities, lakes, rivers, 
and regions without reference to any unifying and 
instructive idea, as so many independent geographical 
objects ? 
It would not be difficult to show that a relatively 
short series of type studies of North America may 
be selected which have the power to organize nearly 
all the important facts of this continent in their nat- 
ural and significant relations. 
The above is but one among many equally good illus- 
trations, to show that nearly all the important facts of 
geography should be learned, incidental to the treat- 
ment of large geographic concepts or type ideas. 
Let us return now to the statement, which is probably 
true, that much the greater part of the geography 
study of children is spent in learning the names and 
locations of places, in cataloguing products, in map- 
sketching, map questions, and review drills, and this 
not in subordination to controlling ideas but as so 
many sheer drills. Is it too much to say that we are 
losing sight of the essentials and are satisfied to 
mumble the formalities of geography? It is, in fact, 
trading off the substance for the shadow of knowledge. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  
  INCIDENTAL TEACHING 137 
Besides the dulness and lack of insight, which are 
the natural fruitage of such formal and spiritless 
study, it is a great waste of time. The facts learned 
in this way, having little coherency or intelligible 
explanation, slip out of the mind and drop back into 
oblivion. So we must have more drills, reviews, and 
repetitions. The threadbare answer to all this, that 
such drills are excellent discipline, has lost almost all 
its force, since our school course is now becoming so 
congested with the variety and quantity of materials, 
that we are forced to call for simplification and reduc- 
tion of waste. Simplification is provided for in the 
selection of a few types or organic centres of thought ; 
an extravagant waste of time and effort is avoided by 
confining cur attention to those facts which are nec- 
essarily incident to the few central topics of study. 
The important principle which we wish to illustrate 
in this chapter is that the great body of important 
facts in geography should be learned incidentally and 
in their natural subordination to the real centres 
of geographic thought. To set up all these varied 
facts as distinct and separate objects of study, leads 
toa dreary round of memory drills with a small expen- 
diture of thought and intelligence. 
We have had numerous illustrations to prove that 
most of the review drills may be dispensed with by a 
constant system of comparing later with earlier objects 
of study and with great increase of interest and 
thoughtfulness. This plan of comparisons is, therefore, 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  138 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
a means of making reviews incidental and far more 
effective. 
Among schoolmasters the tendency is marked, to 
bring secondary matters into great prominence, to 
make a merit of drill and routine, to lose sight of the 
overwhelming importance of the central, organizing 
ideas ofa study. The principle of incidental teaching 
is a constant reminder to force back all these second- 
ary matters to their proper place of subordination, 
where their real value is great. To hold on to the 
trappings and mere formalities of instruction to the 
neglect of the essentials is the old, oft-repeated error 
of form versus spirit. 
Geography, being such a complex subject, drawing 
its constituent materials from the whole wide field of 
the natural sciences, as well as from history and the 
social sciences, is compelled, more than other studies, 
to guard its central strongholds of thought and to 
bring all other subjects into proper subordination to 
these centres,

TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 
A SERIEs oF ToPics RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES ON THE 
Srupy oF GOVERNMENT 
(1) The local town government. (2) State gov- 
ernment at Springfield or of any other state capital. 
(3) The government at Washington. (4) Govern- 
ment of England centring in London. (5) Berlin 
and the Kaiser. (6) St. Petersburg and the Czar. 
This series of topics, beginning with the local mat- 
ters familiar to the child in his own home and reach- 
ing out gradually to the state and nation in which he 
lives, and in the later grades leading to the study of 
foreign governments and their comparison with our 
own, gives us an illustration of the successive topics 
in one great geographical subject. Each of these will 
be briefly treated as follows :— 
1. The local town government. Town councils 
elected by the people are familiar to the children and 
should be described. They have charge of the streets, 
sidewalks, bridges, appointment and payment of the 
police, waterworks, gas or electric light plant, and ex- 
penditure for other purposes. The mayor of the town 
139
-P-A-G-E-152
140 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
is also an executive officer who is directly responsible 
for the ordinances which are passed by the council. 
The justice of the peace in the village tries the cases 
which come before him under the law. We have, 
therefore, in the village the law-making power, the ad- 
ministrative authority, and the local judge for the trial 
of cases. Matters concerning which laws may be passed, 
as streets, bridges, etc., ought to be mentioned; also 
the granting of licenses for the sale of tobacco, liq- 
uors ; concerning bicycles, pedlers, the care of the 
poor, and of tramps; concerning health, the amount 
of tax levy, and other matters. If the children live 
in a small city, or even in a larger city, these topics 
may be somewhat enlarged, and the importance of the 
topics just mentioned may be illustrated in a more 
striking way. This topic is also connected with 
the affairs of the local school board elected by the 
people, which administers the affairs of the schools, 
provides for the buildings and teachers, and the 
expenditure of money for the general purposes of 
education. 
A second topic not mentioned in the outline, well 
worthy of study, is that of the county government as 
centring in the court-house, with its county officers 
and their administration of county affairs. An ex- 
cursion by the children to the court-house, including 
a visit to the court room and to the office of the 
county recorder where the titles to property in the 
town and county are preserved, is a source of excellent

TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 141 
knowledge. Who pays the expenses of the county 
government? The salaries of the county officers? 
The cost of the county court-house and the expenses 
of the county court? The topics which we have just 
referred to should be handled in the third or fourth 
grade as an essential part of the geographical in- 
struction which embraces the leading topics of 
home geography. 
2. The second chief topic in connection with the 
government will be treated in the fourth grade, per- 
haps a year later, and deals with the government at 
the state capital, as, for example, Springfield, Illinois. 
The state Legislature, consisting of the House and 
the Senate, is made up of members selected from the 
different representative and senatorial districts of the 
state and elected by the people. This legislative 
body of two houses makes the laws of the state under 
conditions imposed by the state constitution. Laws 
made by the state Legislature deal with railroads, as, 
for example, the fare to be charged, precautions at 
crossings, bridges, etc. 
State laws also are made upon subjects of state 
taxation, the building or repair of canals, granting 
charters to cities, in regard to temperance and the 
manufacture of liquors, in regard to the school 
affairs of the state, also concerning the state institu- 
tions for the defective classes, as the orphan asylums, 
blind asylums, insane asylums; also for the state 
schools of agriculture, the normal schools, and the
-P-A-G-E-154
  142 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
university. State laws are also made in regard to 
the coal mines, building and loan associations, insur- 
ance companies; also in regard to the state militia 
and equipment. All bills must be agreed upon by 
both houses of the Legislature before they become 
laws and are also generally signed by the Governor 
of the state. The Governor, who is also elected 
every four years by the people of the state, lives 
at Springfield, and with his cabinet is charged with 
carrying out the laws of the state. He has the power 
of appointment of many of the officers and commis- 
sions, as, for example, the governing boards of the 
educational institutions and many other state com- 
missions. He is also at the head of the militia of the 
state, and calls it out in case of serious disturbance 
or war. 
A third division of the government at Springfield 
consists of the state Supreme Court, which meets at 
the capital to try cases which are brought before it 
under the laws of the state. This court of judges 
has the final decision of important cases arising 
under the state laws, for example, the recent reap- 
portionment of the state. But a law passed in the 
Legislature was lately pronounced unconstitutional 
by the Supreme Court, and thereby it ceased to be a 
law, although passed by the state Legislature and 
approved by the Governor. 
In the city of Springfield is found the state capitol, 
a massive building built at the expense of the state, 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 143 
in which are found the large assembly rooms of the 
House of Representatives and Senate, state Supreme 
Court, and the offices of the Governor and other 
state officials. A picture of this building should be 
shown to the children and the principal rooms 
explained; also the other interesting buildings and 
monuments found in the state capital, as, for example, 
the old state-house, now the county court-house at 
Springfield, the old home of Lincoln, and the Lincoln 
monument at the cemetery. The railroad or other 
connections of the state capital with other parts of 
the state should be noted, and the most important 
state institutions should be located. 
No such exhaustive treatment of any other state 
government than that of the home state will be 
found necessary as the children advance to the study 
of other surrounding states. The capitals of the 
various states will be incidentally located as we study 
the other states of the Mississippi Valley and of the 
country. 
3. Inthe fifth or sixth grade the topic of government 
comes up ona larger scale in connection with the study 
of Washington as the capital of the United States. It 
should be made instructive and interesting by means 
of pictures of the great public buildings, important 
monuments, and historical objects of interest in the 
city. The great Capitol building will naturally be 
the centre of this topic, and the three principal head- 
ings will be Congress, the President, and the Su 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
preme Court. The law-making power, or Congress, 
should be explained in the concrete treatment of the 
laws which are passed by Congress; for example, 
the late tariff law which fixed the tariff on many 
kinds of manufactured goods imported into this 
country ; the internal revenue law which levies duty 
upon tobacco, whiskey, and luxuries produced in 
our own country. Laws are also passed relating to 
money and coinage, to commerce, agriculture, patents, 
divorce, immigration, peace and war, army, navy, 
post-office, relations with foreign countries, and a 
great many other important subjects. It should be 
seen that these laws are of such a character as to 
apply equally to all people of the different states and 
not to any particular locality. 
Pictures should be shown in the geographies of 
the House of Representatives, Senate, and some of 
the leading men familiar to the public should be 
named and associated either with the Senate or with 
the House. The President at his home in the White 
House, his duties, and responsibilities will deserve 
some treatment. In what way does the President of 
the United States directly influence the affairs of 
our own home? What men has he appointed to 
office in our town, county, or state? What influ- 
ence has he over the laws that are passed in Con- 
gress? Why is he called the chief executive officer ? 
How is his cabinet appointed, and of what does it 
consist ?
-P-A-G-E-157
  TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 145 
The Supreme Court has jurisdiction over all 
important questions arising under the constitution of 
the United States. What sort of cases does it try? 
Examples of its power in this respect must be cited ; 
as, for example, the more recent transactions in the 
interstate-ccommerce commission, and other cases. 
A short account of the history of the city of Wash- 
ington as the seat of government will be appropriate 
in this connection. Why does it lie so far to one 
side of the country? At the time of the founding of 
Washington, what was the relation of this city to the 
population of the country? How large a city is it? 
How does it compare in size with the largest cities, 
Philadelphia, New York, Chicago, etc.? Study the 
map of the city of Washington, and locate two or 
three of the principal streets and chief public 
buildings. 
Compare now the governments of the United 
States at Washington and of the state at Springfield, 
and even of the local city or village, and bring out 
the fact that the government in all of these cases 
falls into three divisions or departments: the execu- 
tive, legislative, and judicial. In what relation do 
the laws of the city, state, and nation stand to each 
other? How are the officers of these three different 
kinds of government chosen ? 
4. In the seventh grade, when we come to study the 
central government of England at London, we shall 
find the most prominent object, the Houses of Parlia- 
L
-P-A-G-E-158
  146 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
ment on the Thames. An excellent picture of this 
building can be found in one of the geographies or 
in Shepp’s photographs, and from a guide-book the 
ground-plan of the building, showing especially the 
House of Commons and the House of Lords, may be 
secured. 
In the making of the laws the two houses corre- 
spond closely to our House of Representatives and 
Senate, and the general plan of the building, with a 
central hall or dome and the two great chambers on 
opposite sides of it in the wings, is the same as that 
of the national Capitol at Washington and of the 
state capitol building at Springfield, and of many 
other state capitols. 
Upon inquiring into the manner of choosing the 
members of Parliament, the contrast between our 
Senate and the House of Lords appears. Our sena- 
tors are chosen by the state legislatures, the lords 
are mostly hereditary in their rights. They are born 
lords, and with this is connected the right of primo- 
geniture, long since abolished in this country. 
On the executive side the prime minister and his 
cabinet correspond to our President and cabinet. 
Their duties in the main are similar. But at one 
corner of the Houses of Parliament is the great 
Victoria Tower, through which the King passes to 
the robing rooms. The mention of the King brings 
out with great pointedness the one marked contrast 
between our government and that of England. The  
-P-A-G-E-159
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 147 
King, or hereditary monarch, ruling by right of 
birth, is the social and political head of England, 
signs all laws as does our President, calls upon some 
one to form a ministry, etc. 
The Supreme Court of England has in general the 
same functions as that body with us. The striking dif- 
ference is the royal family. It may be well here to 
locate the King’s palaces: St. James and Buckingham, 
near the Parliament houses in London; Balmoral, 
with its immense estates, in Scotland; Windsor, on 
the Thames above London, and Osborne House, on 
the Isle of Wight. Excellent pictures and descrip- 
tions of these are given in Shepp’s photographs. 
All these, like his kingly power, are held by 
hereditary right by the King, and the expense of 
keeping up these establishments and the other 
palaces and the income of the royal family may be 
referred to. The great lords of England, with their 
castles and large landed or city estates, rest upon the 
same basis of primogeniture and heredity as the 
King. 
As we pass later to the treatment of the govern- 
ment of other states in Europe, we shall find this 
fundamental comparison with our familiar govern- 
ment at Washington the essential basis of interpreta- 
tion. In France we find a republic. 
5. In the government of Germany the Reichstag 
and the Herrenhaus correspond to our two Houses 
of Congress, but the Emperor possessed a greater 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
a a 
148 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
power than the King of England. Germany until 
the close of the recent great war was largely ruled 
by the Emperor or Kaiser. The influence of the 
army was also stronger than in other countries. But 
this military system, with the Kaiser at its head and 
a powerful army at his command, has now passed 
away. The governments of the central nations of 
Europe seem now inclined towards democracy, at 
least to a better representation of the interests and 
rights of the people. This movement toward free 
popular government is now common in Europe. 
In Russia the exercise of arbitrary power by one 
man was once more striking and prominent than in 
any of the larger countries of Europe or of the world. 
The concentration of executive, legislative, and judicial 
power in the Czar was in marked contrast to our plan 
and system of government. But the result of the war 
has been the complete destruction of this one-man 
tule, and a revolution has set in which has thus far 
led mainly to anarchy and confusion. Russia is strug- 
gling for democracy. 
In the natural course of geographical studies we 
shall have occasion thus to deal definitely six or seven 
times with government as a topic. Can there re- 
main any doubt that the method of comparison by 
which the later forms of Europe and Asia are com- 
pared step by step with our own government and 
with each other is the proper manner of treatment ? 
The best review of our own government is this de-
-P-A-G-E-161
  TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 149 
tailed comparison of what has been learned of our 
own with the similar and yet different forms of Eng- 
land, Germany, and Russia. 
A SERIES OF STUDIES ON DESERTS 
Tue GREAT BAsIN oF UTAH AND NEVADA 
1. Between the Rocky Mountains of Colorado on 
the east and the Sierra Nevada of California on the 
west lies a region of desert wastes, salt lakes, and 
plateaus cut up by short mountain-chains, whose 
drainage has no outlet to the sea. It is a broken 
plateau between four thousand and five thousand feet 
above the sea-level, and is a little larger than France. 
On the south lies the plateau of the Colorado River 
with its deep canyons, separated by only a slight water- 
shed from the great basin. On the north also the 
watershed between the Snake River and the great 
basin is irregular and difficult to determine. 
This whole region is arid, having only a slight rain- 
fall, owing to the high Sierra Nevada range, which 
intercepts the wet winds coming from the Pacific and 
causes their moisture to fall in rains and snows upon 
the Western mountains. As these winds pass over 
to the plateau, they are mostly dry. 
On the east, the great Rocky Mountain chain like- 
wise takes most of the moisture out of the winds from 
the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi Valley. 
In addition to these causes the plateau in summer- 
time is hot, and the ascending column of hot air dissi-  
-P-A-G-E-162
  150 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
pates what clouds would be formed over the plateau. 
This is especially true in the southern part of the pla- 
teau and in the Colorado basin, so that refreshing 
showers are also cut off in that direction. 
Such rains as do fall within the basin are mostly 
along the ridges of the higher mountain-chains, such 
as the Wasatch and the eastern slopes of the Sierra 
Nevada, which also get a part of the snows and rains 
from the Pacific. From these mountain slopes de- 
scend the streams which supply the salt lakes and 
sinks with water; ¢.g. Bear River and the Jordan, 
flowing into Salt Lake; the Truckee River, flowing 
into Pyramid and Winnemucca lakes, near the Sierra 
Nevada; and the Humboldt, flowing into Hum- 
boldt and Carson sinks; also the Sevier River and 
Lake. : 
Most of the lower mountain ridges crossing this 
plateau extend from north to south and are barren, 
rising precipitously in many places out of the plateau. 
In a few places they are cut through by rivers form- 
ing gorges through which the railroads pass from east 
to west, as, for example, along the Bear and Hum- 
boldt rivers. 
Several parts of this plateau are distinctly marked 
deserts, as is the large tract just west and southwest of 
Salt Lake, which was once a part of Salt Lake itself, 
when the water was more abundant and extended ; 
also the Mohave Desert, with its dreary valley, partly 
below sea-level (called Death Valley), in south. 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES I5\ 
eastern California. In the early caravan days to 
California the passage of the pioneers across the 
deserts of Utah was marked by great sufferings 
and losses. 
Agriculture is possible only where the rivers can 
be used as irrigating streams, which is especially the 
case with those small rivers flowing into the Great 
Salt Lake. Irrigation, however, takes up so much of 
the river waters that the lakes receive but a small 
part, and are much reduced in size. In the valleys 
where irrigating ditches can be used the soil is pro- 
ductive. The natural rainfall is not sufficient to pro- 
duce crops. 
The vegetation of these plains or plateaus is very 
scanty ; the sage-brush (artemisia) and cacti do little 
to enliven the dismal appearance of these dusty 
plains, and in the salty and rocky deserts even these 
are not present. 
In former geological ages these plateaus received 
more rain, the lakes were ten times as large as now, 
and had outlets to the Snake River and Klamath on 
the north, whose old channels have been found. The 
old beach-levels of Salt Lake are clearly traced on 
the neighboring mountains, six hundred feet above 
the present water levels. The salt and soda beds of 
dried-up lakes are found as deserts where once stood 
the lakes. The lakes, having no outlet to the sea, 
are intensely salt or alkaline. 
Only the higher mountain slopes which border these  
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
plateaus and receive rains are covered with forests, 
especially of pine and other evergreen. On the eastern 
slopes of the Sierra Nevada are also found oak and 
deciduous forests. 
In the later study of Europe, Asia, South America, 
and Africa, we shall meet with arid tracts or deserts 
which remind us strongly of the conditions in the 
great basin of Utah and Nevada. 
In the peninsula of Spain and Portugal we find a 
central plateau, bordered along the coasts by fruitful 
and well-watered lowlands or valleys. As the winds 
move toward central Spain, they drop their moisture on 
the fringing mountain slopes, so that the low plateau 
upon which Madrid is built is almost forbidding in its 
aridity. 
In southern Russia and Siberia, in the depressions 
of the Caspian and Aral Seas, are found extensive 
salt deserts bordering these seas, proclaiming, as in 
the deserts about Salt Lake (only ona more extensive 
scale) the former wide extent of the Caspian. These 
salt plains about the Caspian are dreary desert wastes, 
hot and stifling in summer and bleak and cold in winter. 
The great desert of Sahara, especially the western 
part, south of the Atlas Mountains, has some strong 
marks of resemblance to our Western basin. The 
Atlas Mountains catch the moisture brought by the 
western winds from the Atlantic. The small streams 
flowing southward from the Atlas Mountains are 
lost in the sands of the Sahara, like those from the
-P-A-G-E-165
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 153 
Sierra Nevada. At some points the desert is below 
the sea-level, and shows brackish and salt lakes. 
The hot, blistering sands and rocks send up a 
column of heated air that dissipates any clouds that 
might bring raintothedesert. Only where mountain- 
chains cross the desert, as the Hogar chain that sepa- 
rates the western Sahara from the Libyan wastes, is 
there rainfall. A part of the year these mountains 
are covered with snow, and streams descend from the 
melting snows and rains and are lost in the desert, 
creating oases, however, and fruitful tracts. 
The only vegetation found in the deserts, apart from 
the oases, is the artemisia and thorny mimosas, cor- 
responding to the cacti and sage-brush of our Western 
deserts. In the Sahara, also, irrigation from the short 
streams and from artesian wells is the source of the 
groves and fruits which mark the scattered oases. 
The Sahara, like our Western deserts, is not a level 
plateau, but while it averages about 2,000 feet above 
the sea, a small district south of Algeria is 165 feet 
below the level of the sea and is the bed of an ancient 
salt lake. To the south and east the land rises into 
plateaus and mountains from 3300 to 6600 feet high. 
Many ranges of rocky ridges and mountains or sand- 
hills traverse the desert, leaving deep valleys between 
which are the beds of ancient lakes or rivers. 
Lying farther south than our desert tract, it is much 
hotter, and the vegetation of its oases is tropical: 
date-palm, orange, and tropical fruits.
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
The Sahara, the greatest of all deserts, is about 
three thousand one hundred miles from east to west 
and on the average six hundred miles wide, about two- 
thirds of the size of Europe; but nearly a third of this 
vast district is occupied by the oases. 
But the Sahara is only one of a great series of 
deserts extending across Asia and Africa. Arabia, 
especially in its southern part, is one plateau desert 
with smaller wastes to the north. It is really a con- 
tinuation of the Sahara, only slightly interrupted by 
the narrow strip of the Nile and by the expanse of the 
Red Sea. 
Still farther to the northeast, “the principal part 
of the plateau of Iran, occupying a quadrilateral space, 
surrounded by mountains which stop the rains in their 
passage, consists of sterile solitudes, some covered 
with saline beds, the remains of dried-up lakes, others 
spread over with shifting sands, or dotted over with 
reddish colored hills. It is continued toward the 
east by the deserts of Afghanistan and Beloochistan, 
which are not so large and much easier to travel over ” 
(Reclus). 
North of the Himalayas, after touching north- 
western India, the great chain of deserts, protected 
from the rain-bringing winds by the mighty ridges 
of mountains, extends across Tibet and Mongolia. 
“The eastern part of this belt is called according to 
the language Cobi or Chamo, that is to say, the desert 
par excellence, and from its enormous dimensions cor-
-P-A-G-E-167
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 155 
responds with the Sahara of Africa, situated exactly 
at the opposite extremity of the long chain of solitudes 
which stretches right across the old world. The 
mirage, the moving sandhills blown up into eddies, 
and many other phenomena described by African 
travellers are found in certain districts of the Cobi, 
just the same as in all other deserts. But the cold 
here is exceptionally intense, on account of the great 
height of the plateau, which is on an average 4,950 
feet, and the vicinity of the plains of Siberia which 
are crossed by the polar wind. It freezes nearly every 
night and often during the day. The dryness of the 
atmosphere is extreme, there is hardly any vegetation, 
and a few grassy hollows are the only oases of these 
regions. From Kiakhta to Pekin there are only five 
trees for a distance of 400 to 500 miles, which is the 
width of the desert in this part of Mongolia. The 
Cobi, however, like the Sahara, was formerly covered 
by the waters of the ocean; even on the elevated 
plateaus old cliffs may be noticed, the bases of which 
are worn away by the waves, and long strands of 
rough shingle stretch around the area which was 
formerly occupied by a now vanished gulf ” (Reclus). 
This study of deserts and arid regions in America, 
Europe, Africa, and Asia, thus briefly suggested, 
offers a series of widely separated, yet connected, 
lessons which should, in the course of geographical 
study, be brought together. Every time one of 
these topics relative to deserts comes up for full
-P-A-G-E-168
156 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
discussion, a set of comparisons should be insti: 
tuted which will bring to clear remembrance the 
facts previously studied. 
With the area, elevation, salt lakes, and deserts, 
vegetation, mountains, and irrigation of our great 
Western desert basin as a standard of measurement 
we may estimate and compare the Sahara, Arabia, 
the salt steppes of Russia, and the desert of Cobi, 
and by striking resemblances and noticeable differ- 
ences acquire a body of definite and well-organized 
knowledge of this large geographical topic. 
Bound up with this treatment of arid regions and 
deserts are the subjects of irrigation, salt seas having 
no outlet, and caravan trade routes. Moreover, the 
subject of trade-winds and mountain barriers, inter- 
cepting the moisture-laden winds, must be treated in 
this connection as chief causes in producing deserts. 
The peculiar life of the desert regions, the nomad 
and Bedouin tribes, the tent-dwellers, wandering from 
place to place in search of pastures, and the remark- 
ably peculiar fauna and flora of these wastes, must 
be described in order to grasp the meaning of such 
lands which, in spite of their forbidding aspect, are 
still the homes of millions of men. 
The relation of the deserts to the continents as a 
whole and to the equator, and their obstruction to 
commerce, worse than the hardships of high moun- 
tains or broad oceans, should be brought clearly into 
view. 
   
-P-A-G-E-169
  
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 157 
It is easy to see that an elaborate description of 
our great Western basin, with pictures of its dreary 
wastes, its salt lakes and salt and alkali plains, its 
broken and desolate mountains, its dead seas and 
sinks, its canyons and gorges, its scanty and leafless 
vegetation, its small patches of irrigated gardens and 
fields, its shrunken and disappearing rivers, its scorch- 
ing and glaring heat in summer, will form an excel- 
lent groundwork for the understanding of the larger 
desert plateaus of other continents ; especially when 
the causes are traced to the bordering mountains 
which stand sentinel to check the rain-bearing winds, 
when the small populations and difficult trade routes 
are seen as the results of the surface, climate, and 
resources of the country thus situated. 
It is possible in this way, by building up around 
these great central topics from year to year, to gather 
a well-organized body of knowledge. By constant 
comparison of new with old, the essential facts come 
more clearly and prominently into view. 
A SERIES OF STUDIES ON TRADE CENTRES 
Review By COMPARISON 
In the fifth grade the children have a study of 
Minneapolis as a trade centre for lumber from the 
pineries of the North, for wheat and other grain from 
the West, and for manufactured products brought 
from the East, which are distributed from Minne- 
apolis and St. Paul as centres of the wholesale trade.
-P-A-G-E-170
    158 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
The water-power at Minneapolis is especially impor: 
tant for the flour-mills. The river trade finds its ter- 
minus at St. Paul. The railroad and water routes 
from the twin cities via Duluth and Chicago carry 
the staple products, especially flour, to New York 
and Liverpool and to other parts of Europe. This 
topic is fully worked out in the fourth grade. 
When, later, the same year, Pittsburg is studied, 
they will compare the advantages of the two cities. 
Pittsburg is the centre for the great iron and steel 
mills of western Pennsylvania. The iron is obtained 
from the mountains, and the coal along the valleys of 
the Monongahela and other streams furnishes fuel for 
the furnaces. Northward from Pittsburg lie the oil 
regions which supply Pittsburg with another raw 
material for its refineries. The glass-factories, re- 
quiring other raw materials, are also very important 
at Pittsburg. 
The Ohio River supplies an excellent means of 
cheap transportation for the coal, oil, iron products, 
glass, etc., of Pittsburg. A comparison of Pittsburg 
and its surrounding cities with Minneapolis and St. 
Paul will bring out the striking points in each case 
more clearly. 
1. As centres for raw products to be manufactured 
into higher forms. Minneapolis: logs, wheat, and 
grain. Pittsburg: iron, coal, petroleum, and sand 
for glass. Pittsburg also receives some lumber, 
which comes down from the mountains via the
-P-A-G-E-171
  TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 159 
Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. Both Pitts. 
burg and St. Paul are at the head of steamboat 
navigation ; and yet, in both cases, the upper rivers 
are used for small steamboats — for coal barges and 
rafts on the Monongahela, and for lumber rafts and 
rafting steamers on the upper Mississippi. 
2. Manufactured products. For Minneapolis and 
St. Paul, flour, lumber, barrels, furniture, agricultural 
implements, and some lesser ones, as boots and shoes. 
Pittsburg: steel rails, armor plates, pig-iron, illumi- 
nating oil, benzine, vaseline, glassware, lumber, coke, 
SEC: 
3. The trade facilities by railroad and by river. 
Notice on a railroad map the important railroads 
centring in each of these cities; for example, the 
Pennsylvania Central at Pittsburg; the Chicago, 
Milwaukee & St. Paul at St. Paul and Minneapolis. 
4. Both sites of these cities are historically inter- 
esting; Fort Duquesne, changed afterward to Fort 
Pitt, being the most interesting historical point in 
the Ohio Valley; Fort Snelling, at the junction of 
the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, is of special 
importance in the history of the Northwest. 
5. Compare the population of Minneapolis and 
St. Paul with that of Pittsburg and Allegheny :—

  160 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
A similar comparison may be made with Albany 
and Troy at the head of navigation on the Hudson, 
Albany is important — 
1. On account of the commerce along the Erie 
Canal and the great railroad traffic from Buffalo to 
Albany and New York. 
2. The canal connecting Lake Champlain with the 
upper Hudson brings the lumber of the North in large 
quantity to Albany. 
Pittsburg also has a canal connection with Lake 
Erie by way of Beaver River to Erie. Albany and 
St. Paul are capitals of the states and the head of 
navigation of rivers. The population of Albany is 
94,923 and of Troy 60,956. The railroad from Al- 
bany to Boston passes through the Hoosac Tunnel, 
one of the great engineering feats. The railroad from 
Pittsburg to Philadelphia crosses the Alleghany 
Mountains through fine mountain scenery. 
When we come to Europe, we shall find some other 
cities located like Minneapolis and St. Paul, Pittsburg 
and Albany, at the head of steamboat navigation of 
important rivers, e.g. Lyons in southeastern France, 
at the junction of the Rhone and Saone rivers. Lyons 
is located like Pittsburg, partly on the low plain be- 
tween the two rivers and partly on the hills back of it. 
It is the natural outlet for the trade from Switzerland, 
coming from Geneva, down the valley of the Rhone, 
and also for the commerce with the north of France, 
via the Saone River, whose upper waters are connected
-P-A-G-E-173
TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 161 
by canal with the Seine and with the Rhine. One of 
the great railroads of France runs from Paris to Lyons 
and Marseilles. Lyons draws the raw materials for 
its great manufacture of silk goods from its own 
neighborhood. The river furnishes excellent shipping 
facilities toward the south via Marseilles tothe Mediter- 
ranean countries. The population of Lyons in 1896 
was 466,028. Lyons is also a fortified city, having a 
circuit of defences extending thirteen miles from the 
city. It has always been during two thousand years 
a centre of trade up and down the Rhone and Saone 
valleys. 
The points of similarity between Pittsburg and 
Lyons are quite noticeable, including its location on 
the flat land at the junction of the two rivers ; its ex- 
cellent commercial outlet down the river; its canals 
and slack-water navigation in the upper streams; its 
military importance; its manufactories. Compare 
also with London, Bordeaux, Hamburg, and Budapest. 
One of the important topics for study in the United 
States geography is the Hudson River, and in Europe, 
also, the Rhine forms an equally important subject. 
After they have both been studied, a comparison as 
follows will form such a review as will be interesting 
and thought-producing : — 
1. Their commercial importance, In both cases 
these two rivers are great traffic routes, first by 
water, and second by rail. Important railroad lines 
run through both the valleys. The Hudson has three 
M
-P-A-G-E-174
  
162 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
important canals connecting it with Lake Champlain 
and the St. Lawrence, with Lake Erie and the West, 
and with the coal regions of northwestern Pennsylva- 
nia. The Rhine also has three canals connecting its 
upper waters with the Danube and the Rhone and 
the Seine. The Rhine has always been the great 
central traffic route between Northern Europe and 
Southern or Southeastern Europe. The Hudson 
with the Mohawk is the great traffic route be- 
tween the Lake states of the Northwest and 
New York. 
2. The cities. The number of large cities on the 
Rhine, as Rotterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt, Strassburg, 
Basel, Zurich, etc., is greater than on the Hudson, 
but New York and Brooklyn, on account of their size 
and commercial importance, would surpass all the 
cities of the Rhine. In extent the Rhine is eight hun- 
dred miles long, the Hudson two hundred seventy- 
five, but the Hudson is a much larger and deeper 
riverthan the Rhine. This is due to the fact that the 
valley of the Hudson is a drowned valley, the sea hav- 
ing flowed in and filled it up with the sinking of the 
coast lands. The Rhine, on the other hand, is a delta 
river which has built up out of the seaa large area of 
lowland in Holland. In this respect, therefore, they 
are opposites. The navigable portion of the Rhine 
is much longer. The Rhine is navigable below the 
falls of Schaffhausen, although that part of the river 
flowing through the broad valley from Strassburg to  
-P-A-G-E-175
  TYPES RUNNING THROUGH THE GRADES 163 
Mayence is obstructed with shallows. The upper 
Hudson also has shallows. 
3. In point of scenery the Rhine and the Hudson 
both have great attractions ; the Palisades, the High- 
lands and the Catskills furnish even more grand and 
impressive sights than the Rhine between Cologne 
and Bingen. But ancient castles and churches are not 
reproduced on the Hudson. Both rivers rise in the 
mountains, the Alps being much the higher. The 
Rhine springs from the foot of glaciers, the Hudson 
from deep lakes of the Adirondacks, 
4. Both rivers are famous in history. The Rhine 
was crossed by Czsar, Charlemagne, Louis XIV, 
Napoleon I, and William I of Germany. The Rhine 
being on the boundary line between France and 
Germany, has been the scene of many great military 
campaigns. Its chief cities, Cologne, Coblenz, Ma- 
yence, and Strassburg, are strongly fortified. The 
Hudson, also, during the French and Indian wars and 
the Revolution, had great military importance. 
5. Both rivers, also, have an important place in liter- 
ature. Irving with his legends has made the valley of 
the Hudson famous. And the old Indian stories fur- 
nish still other legendary material. The Rhine has 
been famous in song and story for thousands of years. 
The Nibelungen song belongs mainly to this valley. 
Both Goethe and Schiller, greatest of German poets, 
were born and raised in this valley. 
Such comparison as this brings into distinct prom- 
   
-P-A-G-E-176
  164 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
inence the points both of likeness and of difference 
If these points are stated in the form of questions, 
the children will solve many problems of interest, and 
will learn to measure, to estimate, and to organize 
their knowledge. Later in the geographical studies 
of the children they may have occasion to compare 
the Danube, the Po, the Indus, and other rivers with 
the Rhine and the Hudson. In the same way, on a 
larger scale, the Mississippi River with its tributaries 
will offer a standard with which to compare the other 
great rivers of the world, as the Volga, the Yangtse, 
the Nile, the Congo, andthe Amazon. The different 
functions and characters of great river valleys will 
thus be brought out with distinctness. 
In a similar way a study of Pikes Peak and the sur- 
rounding mountains as illustrating the Rocky Moun- 
tain system may be compared with Mont Blanc 
and the Alps, Mount Everest and the Himalayas, 
and Chimborazo and the Andes. 
If the gold and silver mines of Colorado have been 
studied by the children, they should be first compared 
with the other gold-bearing districts in our own coun- 
try —California, Nevada, Montana, and the Klon- 
dike —and afterward in the course of study with the 
mines in South Africa, Australia,and Russia. This will 
bring the knowledge of the whole subject of gold and 
silver mining into a certain completeness and unity.

Outline. Foundation and floor plan. Draw plan. 
Work of excavation, Brick and stone masons. Base- 
ment windows, doors. Drainage, etc. The frame- 
work of the house; beams, joists, studding, rafters,

Several excursions at different times in the process 
of constructing and completing a house are made. 
The observations made upon these trips are later fully 
discussed in the class room.

-P-A-G-E-178
  166 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
The different kinds of trades and tools employed in 
the building are noticed, such as masons, carpenters, 
plumbers, painters, tinners, architect, plasterer, and 
decorator. The shops, quarries, and mills from which 
building materials are obtained, should be mentioned 
and located, e.g. the carpenter shop, planing-mill, tin- 
shop, the stone quarry, the brick yard and kiln. The 
close dependence of all the different trades upon one 
another may be observed. The cost of materials and 
wages of men may be discussed to some extent. 
Frequent drawings on the blackboard to illustrate 
points discussed are helpful. 
2. Excursions to a garden and farm. 
Visits toa near garden in springtime to note the 
turning of the soil, planting, and growth of vegetables, 
such as corn, onions, lettuce, radishes, asparagus, po- 
tatoes, beets, tomatoes, cabbage, celery, etc. Two or 
three of these should be followed through the season. 
A school garden is the best means of following up 
this work, and gives the children a chance to partici- 
pate. The use of the hotbed for obtaining early 
cabbages, and tomatoes is worth studying. The treat- 
ment and fertilizing of soils may be observed. 
In the fall, excursions to the garden to see the 
crops and their gathering in are instructive, e.g. dig- 
ging potatoes and root crops, the picking and mar- 
keting of tomatoes, cabbages, and celery. The 
berries and small fruits are equally interesting. 
A visit to a nursery for fruit and shade trees, both 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
COURSE OF STUDY FULLY OUTLINED 167 
in spring and fall, is very interesting, and in winter 
the budding and grafting may be observed. A visit 
to a typical farm to see the different fields of grain, 
pasture, and woodland, the kinds and care of stock, 
the barns, and granaries, the machines and tools em- 
ployed, will be very instructive. In this connection a 
visit to an agricultural implement store is also helpful. 
Upon all these outdoor excursions, there is op- 
portunity for incidental observation of the open 
country, fields, woods, streams, hills, soils, roads, 
bridges, and various occupations and industries. 
3. Clothing and industries related to clothing. 
Sheep-raising and wool. Cattle and hides. Tan- 
ning of skins. The spinning and weaving of cloth. 
Visit to a carpet-weaver’s. Note machinery used. 
Cotton or woollen mill. The tailor shop. The dress- 
maker’s. The milliner’s, The clothing store. The dry- 
goods store. Variety of goods sold, as cotton cloth, 
linen, silk, lace, woollens, and straw. Shoe-factory. 
(Excursion reserved for fourth grade.) 
In the third grade a study of raw material of clothing 
and their production and treatment as illustrated in 
the home district and in carpet-weaving are in place. 
The more complex processes of manufacture are too 
difficult. 
4. Excursions to shops and stores. 
Visit to a fruit store. Kinds of fruits, etc. The 
bakery and the baking oven. The blacksmith’s shop 
and the wagon-maker’s shop. The grist-mill. Mill.

pond and mill-race. The wheel. The elevator and 
the loading and storage of grain. The grocery store. 
Variety of products. Visit to the park or to the 
woods. These excursions are carefully planned and 
later fully discussed in the class. 
5. Incidental extension of the above topics into 
other states and to foreign lands. 
From the lumber-yard to the Northern pineries, also 
to the yellow-pine woods of the Southern states. Oak 
and other hard woods from the Ohio Valley. From 
the fruit store we may trace the orange to Florida 
and California, peaches to Michigan and New Jersey, 
apples to New York, Missouri, etc., grapes to Cali- 
fornia and New York, bananas to Jamaica. Codfish 
are referred to the fishing-banks, oysters to the 
Chesapeake and Long Island Sound, salmon to the 
Columbia River. 
The flour in the grocery store may be traced to 
Minneapolis and the wheat-fields of the Northwest. 
Salt comes from New York and Michigan, sugar 
from Louisiana, Hawaii, and Cuba. Meats from the 
corn regions of the middle West, from Kansas City, 
Chicago, etc. Fine building-stone is obtained from 
Indiana, Tennessee, Vermont, Massachusetts, etc. 
Coffee may be traced to Brazil, tea to China and 
Japan, fine chinas to France and Germany. 
Gold and silver are referred to the mines of Colo- 
rado and California, hard coal to Pennsylvania, coal-oil 
to Pennsylvania, Texas, and California. In locating
-P-A-G-E-181
  
COURSE OF STUDY FULLY OUTLINED 169 
the sources from which these products come it is 
hardly advisable to enter into any full treatment of 
the modes of production. This full descriptive treat- 
ment will be given in the following years. The loca- 
tion of such regions is easily and quickly made upon 
large wall maps or by blackboard sketches. It is 
merely incidental to the treatment of home topics. 
6. Local map-making. 
Beginning with the schoolhouse and grounds, 
make a simple map of the town and neighborhood 
with two or three streets and a few roads leading 
into the country. The creek or river is included 
and the railroads to neighboring towns. Use sand 
maps also to express surface irregularities, and let the 
points of the compass be taught incidentally. After 
a little practice the maps can be drawn to a scale. 
7. Primitive peoples and occupations. 
America supplies three good types of primitive 
life, the Eskimo of the North, their houses, hunting, 
and modes of life; the Indians as described by Park- 
man, Starr, and other travellers ; and the Zuni Indians 
of the Southwest and of Mexico. 
The “Seven Little Sisters” and “Each and All” 
furnish simple descriptions of life in the chief re- 
gions of the world for third-grade children getting 
their first notions of distant peoples and countries. 
They can be read by the teacher, discussed, and as far 
as possible illustrated by pictures, cardboard, and 
other constructions.  
-P-A-G-E-182
170 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
8. Study of the world-whole. 
The largest globes available should be used 
Children enjoy thinking of the earth as a large globe, 
and finding the continents and oceans. The location 
of all the chief countries with reference to North 
America and the home, and the familiarity with the 
cardinal directions, may be accomplished in a few 
lively oral lessons. 
g. Related topics in history. 
Local history, grandfather stories, family histo- 
ries, leading men and families. The early pioneers 
and settlers. Their houses. Regions from which 
they came and modes of travel at that time. Early 
roads. Indian stories and traditions of the surround- 
ing country. Improvements, such as roads, bridges, 
schoolhouses, railroads, etc. Historical relics, pub- 
lic buildings, monuments, museums. Places of his- 
toric interest. Historical celebrations, Decoration 
Day, Thanksgiving, etc. 
10. Closely related science topics. 
Garden vegetables, grasses, and grains. Hot- 
house plants, forest trees. Fruit trees, budding and 
grafting. Tree-planting. The changes of the sea- 
sons. Plant and animal life in ponds and creeks. 
Various soils, sands, rocks, and their uses. Quarries 
and stratified rock. The water-supply, and pure 
water, wells, springs. Domestic animals and their 
uses.

1. Local physiography. 
Excursions for the examination of landscapes, hills, 
valleys, streams, and tributaries. Water action upon 
soils, rocks, and valleys. Soils upon uplands and low- 
lands and effects upon vegetation. Rich bottom-lands. 
Modes of fertilizing fields, rotation of crops. Rock 
strata along streams and valley slopes. Deposits 
of sand gravel and glacial drift. Note the influence 
of valleys and hills upon the location of towns, 
bridges, course of railroads, wagon roads. General 
views from commanding points on hills or bluffs or 
high buildings over town and country. Climate and 
seasons, seasonal changes. Effects of rain-storms 
and floods. Spring freshets. Snow-storms and ice. 
Winds. Movements of the sun and moon and the 
varying length of day and night. The effect of 
changing seasons upon the occupations of men. 
2. Local commerce. 
The town as a local trade centre. Roads leading 
into the country. Products of farms, gardens, and 
forests brought into town. Railroads, freight offices, 
and shipment of goods. Local factories and their 
shipments. Goods retailed to town and country 
people. A small town is the best illustration for 
children of a trade centre. A. county-seat is usually 
the best example of a trade centre for all the roads 
of the county.  
-P-A-G-E-184
172 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
3. Local government. 
The town council and how chosen. The mayot 
and his duties. Town ordinances in regard to police 
roads, and bridges, gas or electric lighting, licenses, 
fire-department, etc. Local magistrates’ and justices’ 
courts. Local taxation and the uses to which it is 
put. The court-house, county court, and trials. 
Judges and juries. County records in court-house. 
In the home geography, government should deal with 
well-known people and objects which illustrate the 
facts of law-making, taxes, election, office-holding, 
and other duties of magistrates. In other words it 
should be very concrete and illustrative. 
4. Large manufacturing plants. 
Visits to shoe-factories, planing-mills, railroad shops, 
founderies, grist-mills, furniture factories, printing- 
offices, waterworks, cotton or woollen mills, carriage 
factories, canneries for fruit or vegetables, wholesale 
houses, tile-works, and potteries, ship-yards, dairies, 
sugar-factories, etc. 
These more complex forms of industrial life are 
better visited in the fourth grade than in the third, 
and some of them belong in still later years. There 
should be a discussion in the class after each excur- 
sion, with such drawings and pictures as are neces- 
sary. 
5. A few leading topics of the home state. 
This is the first step in the outward movement from 
the home. The more striking and less difficult topics
-P-A-G-E-185
COURSE OF STUDY FULLY OUTLINED 173 
call for a very complete description. In New York 
State, for example, the following may serve. The 
Hudson River, the Adirondack Mountains, the Erie 
Canal, fruit-growing (apples and grapes), dairying, 
Lake Ontario. In the state of Illinois (treated as the 
home), the list of topics may be as follows: the 
Illinois River, the prairies, the corn-fields, the Illinois 
and Michigan Canal (also the Drainage Canal). 
The map of the state will be used freely and 
sketched often in outline on the board. 
6. The relief map of North America. 
A sand map representing the chief plains and high- 
lands of North America. It can be made by the 
teacher while describing the continent in its main 
features. The treatment should be brief and simple, 
and the ideas gained will help to interpret the flat 
maps. 
7. Large, descriptive topics of North America. 
A few such bold topics capable of picturesque por- 
traiture may give correct primary notions of moun- 
tains, river valleys, coast scenery, forests, lakes, cities, 
plains, etc. Large pictures and bird’s-eye views, pan- 
oramic surveys, and landscapes may be secured. Pho- 
tographs and stereoscopic views of notable scenery 
are not difficult to secure, and the geographies con- 
tain many suitable pictures. 
Topics: scenes and descriptions along the Atlantic 
coast from Labrador to Florida, — capes and head- 
lands, fishing-fleets, beaches, and bathing resorts,   
  
    
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  
174 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
light-houses, harbors, and cities, islands, rocky coasts, 
bays, and river mouths. A steamboat trip down the 
Mississippi River from the Northern lakes to the delta, 
with pictures. Scenes from the Appalachian High- 
lands. Cattle-ranches in the plains and foot-hills. 
The Yellowstone Park and other parks and scenes 
of the Rocky Mountains. A summer among the 
woods and mountains of Maine. A winter in Florida. 
The plateau of Mexico. 
8. Journeys round the world. 
A trip around the world on the parallel of the home. 
This forms an interesting base-line, on each side of 
which cities and countries can be ranged, and a help- 
ful comparison of diverse countries be made. 
A trip around the world on a meridian. This 
brings out all the contrasts of climate, the similarity 
of Northern and Southern hemispheres and the dif- 
ferences. 
Steamboat voyage around the world. This is a 
means of discovering the position of different conti- 
nents and oceans and some of the peculiar things of 
ocean navigation. These three excursions may serve 
to give the children a more definite idea of the geog- 
raphy of the world-whole. Pictures should be freely 
used. 
g. Geography topics suggested by “ American His- 
tory Stories.” 
After completing a history story,a lesson may 
well be given, surveying more fully the geographical 
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  
COURSE OF STUDY FULLY OUTLINED 175 
conditions involved in the story. For example, 
after completing Champlain’s voyages and explora- 
tions a careful survey of the geography of the 
whole, the St. Lawrence, Nova Scotia, Lake Cham- 
plain, the Ottawa River, the homes of the Iro- 
quois and Hurons, the Atlantic Ocean and France, 
will greatly strengthen both the geography and the 
history. 
Other stories for a similar historical review are 
Hudson’s voyages and explorations, the Pilgrims 
and the voyage across the Atlantic, Captain John 
Smith and his exploring trips, Boone and the passes 
of the Alleghanies, Raleigh’s expeditions, Washing- 
ton’s early life. 
10. Geographical surveys suggested by European 
history stories and the Bible stories. 
The stories of Abraham, Joseph, and David. Early 
Italian stories of Rome. Julius Caesar in Gaul and 
England. King Alfred and the Danes. The Angles 
and Saxons. 
In all these early history stories of Europe, a 
distinct emphasis should be placed upon the geog- 
raphy. The transfer of this careful survey to the 
geography proper will insure a definite comprehen- 
sion of the geographical situations. In all cases 
maps and blackboard sketches should be freely used. 
Pictures and sand maps, and all the means of con- 
crete illustration are needed to insure clear and 
correct notions.

CHAPTER XII 
LIST OF BOOKS CAREFULLY ARRANGED ACCORDING 
TO GRADES 
TuHE following list of books has been selected for 
the aid of teachers in carrying out the above course 
of study. 
In each grade the books are divided into three 
groups (except in third grade). 
1. The text-books which constitute the basis of 
the school work and are of use to both teacher and 
pupils. The standard text-books can be used in this 
place. 
2. The reference books which are suitable for the 
children, such as geographical readers, books of travel, 
closely related books in history and science. These 
books are useful in the school library, and should be 
such as the children can consult independently and 
under the direction of the teacher. They cover a 
ider range of topics and give much detailed informa- 
ion not possible of incorporation into text-books. 
They are often well illustrated, and are written mostly 
in a simple and interesting style. They supplement 
effectively the work of the text-books, and give, also,

-P-A-G-E-212
    
200 SPECIAL METHOD IN GEOGRAPHY 
an outlet for the activity of the abler pupils in their 
leisure time. 
3. Additional reference books for teachers. The 
larger books, dealing more exhaustively with impor- 
tant phases of geography, geology, and history should 
be, as far as possible, within the teacher’s reach. 
Such books are beyond the capacity of children, but 
they greatly enlarge and stimulate the teacher and 
also furnish an abundant store of ideas and illus- 
trative facts with which to enrich the work of the 
recitation. 
Pedagogical books dealing with geography and 
related subjects are included, and some of the larger 
scientific books and great works on geography and 
science are incorporated into this list. The school 
library, as far as possible,. should be supplied with a 
full series of all these works.
